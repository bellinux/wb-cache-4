It received more votes {{than any of the}} other 24 historic Chicago sites participating in the contest, including the Robie House, the Chicago Cultural Center, and Unity Temple.|$|E
5|$|Accounts of {{the final}} {{termination}} of the coup attempt vary between historians. Gleijeses stated that while the freighter {{was on its way}} to Nicaragua, a CIA employee went to Miller, and asked him to sign a document on behalf of the munitions department. Miller refused, and instead showed the document to his superiors, who in turn informed Dean Acheson. Gleijeses writes that Acheson immediately spoke to Truman as a result of this document, and the operation was cut short. Nick Cullather writes that due to Somoza <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> about the coup, the State Department decided that the cover of the operation had been lost. Other diplomats began to learn of the operation, and on 8 October Dean Acheson summoned Smith and called off the operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} obtaining good-quality free-labor {{products}} forced Coffin to travel south {{to seek out}} plantations that did not use slave labor to produce their goods. He met with only limited success. Coffin located a cotton plantation in Mississippi, where the owner had freed all his slaves and hired them as free laborers. The plantation struggled financially because it had no equipment to automate cotton production. Coffin helped the owner purchase a cotton gin that greatly increased the plantation's productivity and provided {{a steady supply of}} cotton for Coffin's association. The cotton was shipped to Cincinnati, where it was spun into cloth and sold. Other trips to Tennessee and Virginia were less successful, although he did succeed in <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> about the free-labor goods movement.|$|E

5|$|Susan accepts {{an offer}} from her landlady, Maxine Rosen (Lainie Kazan), to appear on a website in which she does {{housework}} in her lingerie {{in order to make}} ends meet, though she keeps her new job a secret from her friends and family. Soon after, Maxine's site is merged with a larger company that uses Susan's image to advertise the website on billboards across the country. Susan pays the company $9,000 to have the billboards removed. As a result, she begins working for the website's video chatting services to earn back the money. Paul discovers her secret and threatens to expose it unless she sells him her home, in which he now lives with his second wife, Beth (Emily Bergl). Hoping to derail Paul's blackmail scheme, Susan tells Mike about her job on the website. Paul retaliates by <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> about Susan's involvement with the website, causing her to lose her teaching job. Strapped for money, Mike accepts a job on an oil rig in Alaska and Susan becomes Lynette's nanny.|$|E

25|$|Christianity is India's {{third most}} {{followed}} religion {{according to the}} census of 2011, with approximately 28 million followers, constituting 2.3 percent of India's population. Christianity was purportedly introduced to India by Thomas the Apostle, who landed in Muziris, Kerala in AD 52 and travelled along the coast to Goa <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> of Christ. There is a general scholarly consensus that Christianity was definitely established in India by the 6th century AD, including some communities who used Syriac liturgies, {{and it is possible}} that the religion's existence extends as far back as the purported time of St.Thomas's arrival.|$|E
25|$|According to legend, Hala Sultan {{died after}} falling off her mule and {{breaking}} her neck {{during the first}} Arab incursions into Cyprus around 647 A.D. The same night, a divine power supposedly placed three giant stones where she lay. In 1760, Hala Sultan's grave was discovered by Sheikh Hasan; he began <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> about her healing powers, and a tomb was built there. The complex – comprising a mosque, mausoleum, minaret, cemetery and living quarters {{for men and women}} – was constructed in its present form while the island was still under Ottoman rule, and completed in around 1816.|$|E
25|$|Around 650 AD, St Birinus, {{the first}} Bishop of Dorchester (Oxford), sent his missionaries into Wessex. The small {{settlement}} that {{existed at the}} time on the headland now known as Hengistbury Head, proved unsuitable for the purpose of <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> of God because it was set back from and out of reach of the traders who used the busy port. Far more useful was a stretch of raised land between the two rivers of the Avon and Stour which carried people and their wares to and from settlements such as Blandford and Old Sarum (Salisbury). The site had other advantages in that it was raised and well drained, it could easily be defended being surrounded on three sides by water, it was close to the lowest crossing points of the two rivers, and there was a plentiful supply of drinking water both from the rivers and a number of wells in the area now known as Purewell.|$|E

25|$|Armenia, so {{long the}} battle-ground of Romans and Persians, lost its {{independence}} in 387, and was {{divided between the}} Byzantine Empire and Persia, about four-fifths being given to the latter. Western Armenia was governed by Byzantine generals, while an Armenian king ruled, but only as feudatory, over Persian Armenia. The Church was naturally influenced by these violent political changes, although the loss of civil independence and the partition of the land could not destroy its organization or subdue its spirit. Persecution only quickened it into greater activity, and {{had the effect of}} bringing the clergy, the nobles, and the common people closer together. The principal events of this period are the invention of the Armenian alphabet, the revision of the liturgy, the creation of an ecclesiastical and national literature, and the readjustment of hierarchical relations. Three men are prominently associated with this work: Mesrop, Patriarch Isaac, and King Vramshapuh, who succeeded his brother Khosrov IV in 389. In 394, with the help of blessing of Armenia's Catholicos, Sahak Partev, Mesrop set out on a mission of <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> of God to a pagan or semi-pagan people.|$|E
500|$|GISHWHES {{challenges}} {{vary widely}} in focus and sometimes attract media attention. The Los Angeles-focused OC Weekly {{reported on a}} local ice cream shop's response to a GISHWHES team that asked them to create a custom ice cream flavor for the 2013 challenge [...] "Get your team's new ice cream flavor on sale in an ice cream parlor". Another challenge involved participants using and <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> abnosome, Collins's portmanteau of abnormal and awesome. During the 2013 hunt, competitors were asked to dress up as the DC Comics character Flash and have their pictures taken next to a functioning particle accelerator. As a result, the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and Fermilab received numerous emails from GISHWHES participants and set up special tours for the visitors. Dean Golembeski reported in Symmetry, the official magazine of Fermilab and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, that the visits were welcomed and seen {{as an opportunity to}} educate a wider audience on the goals of and research done at national laboratories.|$|E

He became involved with the development of radar, heading a group at the University of Birmingham that included John Randall and Harry Boot. They created a radical new design, the cavity magnetron, that made microwave radar possible. Oliphant also formed part of the MAUD Committee, which reported in July 1941, that an atomic bomb was not only feasible, but might be produced as early as 1943. Oliphant was instrumental in <b>spreading</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> of this finding in the United States, thereby starting what became the Manhattan Project. Later in the war, he worked on it with his friend Ernest Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, California, developing electromagnetic isotope separation.|$|E
