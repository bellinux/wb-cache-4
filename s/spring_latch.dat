And he was not even quite sure that there had been a flutter. He had no reason to hurry up. On coming abreast of the shop he observed that it had been closed early. There was nothing very unusual in that. The men on duty had special instructions about that shop: what went on about there was not to be meddled with unless absolutely disorderly, but any observations made were to be reported. There were no observations to make; but from a sense of duty and for the peace of his conscience, owing also to that doubtful flutter of the darkness, the constable crossed the road, and tried the door.

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{fabrication}} of vertical three-dimensional micro-Fresnel lenses with polysili-con materials by surface micromachining technique. Micro-Fresnel lenses {{play a very}} important role in micro-optics because of their thin film structures and their ability to achieve very short fo-cal lengths. Although micro-Fresnel lenses have been studied and well understood [11, the lens planes usually are restrained {{on the surface of the}} substrate.

5000|$|Electric strikes can be {{differentiated}} in {{a number}} of ways, frame type it can be installed in, duty (continuous or intermittent), and which variety of locking mechanism on the door it can work with. [...] The four most common locking mechanisms concerned with electric strikes are Cylindrical, Deadbolt, Mortise, and Rim Panic Exit Devices. Cylindrical locks tend towards residential use and, as such, electric strikes for cylindrical locks tends towards more economy. Deadbolts, also known as night latches, do not have a spring mechanism which means the strike for a deadlatch is 'hold' only (the dead bolt is thrown and it engages in the electric strike cavity, the electric strike can release it but cannot subsequently 'recapture it' since the deadbolt lacks the <b>spring</b> <b>latching</b> capability of the other lock sets). Mortise type locksets tend towards larger projecting latches from the door to engage deeper in the frame and electric strikes used for these locking mechanisms require more cutting and space in the frame. Rim Panic devices are required in many buildings as a 'single motion' means of egress and electric strikes used in these situations tend towards entirely different designs and opening actions as compared to electric strikes for other situations.|$|R

40|$|Trap-jaw ants are {{characterized}} by high-speed mandibles used for prey capture and defense. Power-amplified mandibles have independently evolved {{at least four times}} among ants, with each lineage using different structures as a <b>latch,</b> <b>spring</b> and trigger. We examined two species from the genus Myrmoteras (subfamily Formicinae), whose morphology is unique among trap-jaw ant lineages, and describe the performance characteristics, spring-loading mechanism and neuronal control of Myrmoteras strikes. Like other trap-jaw ants, Myrmoteras latch their jaws open while the large closer muscle loads potential energy in a <b>spring.</b> The <b>latch</b> differs from other lineages and is likely formed by the co-contraction of the mandible opener and closer muscles. The cuticle of the posterior margin of the head serves as a spring, and is deformed by approximately 6 % prior to a strike. The mandibles are likely unlatched by a subgroup of closer muscle fibers with particularly short sarcomeres. These fast fibers are controlled by two large motor neurons whose dendrites overlap with terminals of large sensory neurons originating from labral trigger hairs. Upon stimulation of the trigger hairs, the mandibles shut in as little as 0. 5 ms and at peak velocities that are comparable with other trap-jaw ants, but with much slower acceleration. The estimated power output of the mandible strike (21 kW kg(- 1)) confirms that Myrmoteras jaws are indeed power amplified. However, the power output of Myrmoteras mandibles is significantly lower than distantly related trap-jaw ants using different spring-loading mechanisms, indicating a relationship between power-amplification mechanism and performance...|$|R

50|$|In a soft-recoil system, {{the spring}} (or air cylinder) that returns the barrel to the forward {{position}} starts {{out in a}} nearly fully compressed position, then the gun's barrel is released free to fly forward in the moment before firing; the charge is then ignited just as the barrel reaches the fully forward position. Since the barrel is still moving forward when the charge is ignited, {{about half of the}} recoil impulse is applied to stopping the forward motion of the barrel, while the other half is, as in the usual system, taken up in recompressing the <b>spring.</b> A <b>latch</b> then catches the barrel and holds it in the starting position. This roughly halves the energy that the spring needs to absorb, and also roughly halves the peak force conveyed to the mount, as compared to the usual system. However, the need to reliably achieve ignition at a single precise instant is a major practical difficulty with this system; and unlike the usual hydro-pneumatic system, soft-recoil systems do not easily deal with hangfires or s. One of the early guns to use this system was the French 65 mm mle.1906; it was also used by the World War II British PIAT man-portable anti-tank weapon.|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{introduces}} {{a new concept}} in 3 -D RF microelectromechanical systems switches intended for power ap-plications. The novel switch architecture employs electrothermal hydraulic microactuators to provide mechanical actuation and 3 -D out-of-plane silicon cantilevers that have both <b>spring</b> action and <b>latching</b> mechanisms. This facilitates an OFF-state gap separation distance of 200 Î¼m between ohmic contacts, {{without the need for}} any hold power. Having a simple assembly, many of the inherent problems associated with the more traditional suspension-bridge and cantilever-type-beam architectures can be overcome. A single-pole single-throw switch has been investigated, and its measured ON-state insertion and return losses are less than 0. 3 dB up to 10 GHz and greater than 15 dB up to 12 GHz, respectively, while the OFF-state isolation is better than 30 dB up to 12 GHz.

The two joint halves are engaged transversely - the tongue of the NJB mating with the groove of the CEJB and vice versa. The joint system employs a <b>spring</b> loaded internal <b>latch</b> mechanism housed in the CEJB. During mating, this mechanism is {{pushed away from the}} NJB and enters the NJB when mating is completed. In order to lock the joint and add a preload across the tongue and groove faces, an operating ring collar is rotated through 45 deg causing an internal mechanism to compress a Belleville washer preload mechanism. This causes an equal and opposite force to be exerted on the latch bolt and the latch plunger. This force presses the two joint halves tightly together. In order to prevent inadvertent disassembly, a secondary lock is also engaged when the joint is closed. Plungers are carried in the operating ring collar. When the joint is closed, the plungers fall into tracks on the CEJB, which allows the joint to be opened only when the operating ring collar and plungers are pushed directly away from the joining end. One application of this invention is the rapid assembly and disassembly of diverse skeletal framework structures which is extremely important in many projects involving the exploration of space...|$|R
40|$|The FETS is a {{light and}} compact thermal surface (sun shade, IR thermal shield, cover, and/or {{deployable}} radiator) that is mounted {{on a set of}} offset tape-spring hinges. The thermal surface is constrained during launch and activated in space by a thermomechanical latch such as a wax actuator. An application-specific embodiment of this technology developed for the MATMOS (Mars Atmospheric Trace Molecule Occultation Spectrometer) project serves as a deployable cover and thermal shield for its passive cooler. The FETS fits compactly against the instrument within the constrained launch envelope, and then unfolds into a larger area once in space. In this application, the FETS protects the passive cooler from thermal damage and contamination during ground operations, launch, and during orbit insertion. Once unfolded or deployed, the FETS serves as a heat shield, intercepting parasitic heat loads by blocking the passive cooler s view of the warm spacecraft. The technology significantly enhances the capabilities of instruments requiring either active or passive cooling of optical detectors. This can be particularly important for instruments where performance is limited by the available radiator area. Examples would be IR optical instruments on CubeSATs or those launched as hosted payloads because radiator area is limited and views are often undesirable. As a deployable radiator, the panels making up the FETS are linked thermally by thermal straps and heat pipes; the structural support and deployment energy is provided using tape-spring hinges. The FETS is a novel combination of existing technologies. Prior art for deployable heat shields uses rotating hinges that typically must be lubricated to avoid cold welding or static friction. By using tape-spring hinges, the FETS avoids the need for lubricants by avoiding friction altogether. This also eliminates the potential for contamination of nearby cooled optics by outgassing lubricants. Furthermore, the tape-spring design of the FETS is also self-locking so the panels stay in a rigid and extended configuration after deployment. This unexpected benefit makes the tape-spring hinge design of the FETS a light, simple, reliable, compact, non-outgassing hinge, <b>spring,</b> and <b>latch.</b> While tape-spring hinges are not novel, they have never been used to deploy passive unfolding thermal surfaces (radiator panels, covers, sun shades, or IR thermal shields). Furthermore, because this technology is compact, it has minimal impact on the launch envelope and mass specifications. FETS enhances the performance of hosted payload instruments where the science data is limited by dark noise. Incorporating FETS into a thermal control system increases radiator area, which lowers the optical detector temperature. This results in higher SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) and improved science data...|$|R
