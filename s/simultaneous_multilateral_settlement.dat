40|$|Part 5 : CompositionalityInternational audienceWe analyse the {{economic}} interaction {{on the market}} for composed services. Typically, as providers of composed services, intermediaries interact on the sales side with users and on the procurement side with providers of single services. Thus, in how far a user request can be met often crucially depends on the prices and qualities of the different single services used in the composition. We study an intermediary who purchases two complementary single services and combines them. The prices paid to the service providers are determined by <b>simultaneous</b> <b>multilateral</b> Nash bargaining between the intermediary and the respective service provider. By using a function with constant elasticity of substitution (CES) to determine the quality of the composed service, we allow for complementary as well as substitutable degrees of the providers’ service qualities. We investigate quality investments of service providers and the corresponding evolution of the single service quality within a differential game framework...|$|R

Currency inconvertibility in turn dictated bilateral balancing of accounts, which {{has been one of}} the basic objectives of intergovernmental trade agreements among members. An earlier system of bilateral clearing accounts was replaced on January 1, 1964, by accounts with the International Bank for Economic Cooperation, using the transferable ruble as the unit of account. Although the bank provided a centralized mechanism of trade accounting and swing credits to cover temporary imbalances, it could not establish a system of multilateral clearing because of the centrally planned nature of the members' economies and the inconvertibility of their currencies. In 1987, the transferable ruble remained an artificial currency functioning as an accounting unit and was not a common instrument for <b>multilateral</b> <b>settlement.</b> For this reason, this currency continued to be termed [...] "transferable" [...] and not [...] "convertible." ...|$|R

We show how the structure of coalition externalities shapes the choice between sequential and multilateral bargaining, and we identify circumstances in which the grand coalition is the equilibrium outcome, leading to worldwide free trade. A model of international trade is then used to illustrate equilibrium outcomes and how they depend {{on the structure of}} trade and protection. Global free trade is not achieved when the political-economy motive for protection is sufficiently large. Furthermore, the model generates both “building bloc ” and “stumbling bloc ” effects of preferential trade agreements. In particular, we describe an equilibrium in which global free trade is attained only when preferential trade agreements are permitted to form (a building bloc effect), and an equilibrium in which global free trade is attained only when preferential trade agreements are forbidden (a stumbling bloc effect). The analysis identifies conditions under which each of these outcomes emerges. JEL Classification: C 78, F 1...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} a development of financial {{relations of the}} socialist states in the years of 1945 — 1963 and 1964 — 1982. Conditioning of the first period, forming and developing bilateral financial relations, {{is presented in the}} aspect of strong trends of protection of newly constructed industry, limited supply of export goods and inelastic demand on certain products. Circumstances of the second period which gave rise to technical and settling conditions for <b>multilateral</b> <b>settlements</b> are discussed in the latter part, they were not able to relieve a trade system of the socialist countries from the bilateral balancing. Discussing a complex problem of efficiency of <b>multilateral</b> <b>settlements,</b> the author quotes opinions of international finances' specialists and researchers and seeks for new substantial and technical solutions in order to arrive to an agreement between principles of state controlled economy and demands of international trade in the aspect of settlements. In the author's opinion, models of cash settlements between the socialist countries are unsatisfactory at their present stage. The author advocates that requirements of life have to be followed: the conditions of foreign trade are varying, world's economy is not static, supply of goods and services and demand are constantly fluctuating as well as world prices. It is therefore necessary to introduce a reasonable multilaterality of settlements making for stimulation of currency and increase of weight of finances in international settlements and in consequence- for multilateral balancing of trade turnover. In view of the tendencies to isolate socialist countries in the foreign trade, the author emphasises the need to concentrate efforts to create better currency system which would, under the influence of developing CMEA cooperation, improve <b>multilateral</b> <b>settlements.</b> Although payments turnover is functioning efficiently in the CMEA countries by means of the transfer ruble, the article indicates that major problems in the trade between socialist countries are caused by the fact that each socialist state, in order to balance its foreign trade according to plan, establishes quotas, attempts at bilateral balancing of a foreign trade and links directly a volume of exports and imports of deliveries under contract. Bilaterality understood in that way diminishes utility of transfer ruble and its flexibility in settlements and results in ruble's failure to perform its functions in the international trade. In the following remarks the author discusses the role of transfer ruble in settlements in socialist states as a product of the currency system of these states and of the principle of inconvertibility of national currencies, he is also trying to determine whether transfer ruble is a contractual unit of settlement predominated by elements of bilateralism or it is a type of international currency. The author adopts a notion of transfer ruble as an international currency, in its narrow meaning, i. e. which is recognized solely by those states which had created it, as their common unit of account. The article attributes functions of money sui generis to transfer ruble: a scope in which the ruble can perform classical functions of money is described, as a standard of value, as a tender, as a means of accumulation of value. Various views of scientists and financial experts are quoted in this respect. In conclusion, the author admits that transfer ruble is not an international currency in the wide meaning of this word and should be classed among extramonetary units of settlement. Present forms of trade between socialist countries should be, in the authors opinion, altered to overcome a "product for product" barrier, to extend the trade turnover and to create a possibility of converting a value expressed in one currency into another currency. This requires the existence of real exchange rates and a national currency should act as a tender not only in the country but also abroad. Estimating real financial relations of trade and settlements, the author speaks for improving the existing collective currency and elaborating a program in future aiming at introducing convertible currency of the CMEA states or, at least, a currency of partially limited convertibility.

This set off wor 1 d-wide protests by environmental NGOs against the WTO, criticizing it as an icon of globalization. This article first analyses the WTO panel reports and clarifies that the panel never rejected the objectives of Section 609, but only criticized its unilateral, in flexible application. The position of the US on this matter was judged to be arbitrary and unjustifiable, because it failed to engage in serious negotiations with the concerned countries. In 2001 ，the WTO panel，contrary to its earlier decision，recognized the US ban as legitimate. This time，the WTO considered positively the US 2 ̆ 7 s subsequent efforts to conclude a multilateral agreement for the protection of sea turtles.

40|$|Theoretical {{analyses}} of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism suggest that the system contains only weak incentives {{for the implementation of}} rulings. Against this background, it is puzzling that the specific WTO procedure which deals with allegedly insufficient implementation is used only in about one third of the cases where the need for implementation has arisen. Yet, {{a closer look at the}} where implementation has allegedly occurred can partly resolve this puzzle: The defendant government implemented the rulings by modifying or repealing the contemplated measures.

40|$|Restricted until 29 Sep. 2012. This thesis {{examines}} {{the variations in}} both the level of patent protection and changes therein across countries and over time. The main finding is that both domestic economic, political and legal characteristics as well as bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> dispute <b>settlement</b> mechanisms are important in raising countries’ patent rights protection in the past decades.; More specifically, my studies confirm that domestic economic development, associated with R&D investment, {{is the main reason}} for countries to improve their patent protection, with human capital, political freedom and trade openness as contributing factors. Furthermore, Common Law countries and German Civil Law countries tend to provide higher protection for patent rights than French Civil Law countries, although its effect on patent protection might not be direct but probably only indirect through its effect on R&D and trade openness. Last but not least, bilateral dispute settlement mechanisms, represented by the U. S. ’s Special 301 placements and Section 306 monitoring, have significantly and consistently positive effects on propelling target countries to provide higher legislative protection for patents, just as bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with the U. S. do. Designating a country as “Priority Foreign County”, which is the most severe but seldom used instrument of “unilateral aggressiveness”, did not by itself contribute to the improvement of patent protection according to the results. It does, however, work with other bilateral coercive means. The strengthened WTO dispute settlement mechanism only plays a marginal effect on countries’ patent protection over time. The bilateral dispute settlement mechanisms represented by the U. S. Trade Representative’s Special 301 placements and other monitoring procedures and bilateral incentives resulting from the BITs between the U. S. and other countries overwhelmed domestic economic, political and legal characteristics in explaining the improvement of patent protection over time. I also show that autocratic regimes are more vulnerable to bilateral pressures asking for improving patent protection.; This thesis contributes to our understanding of patent protection in particular and IPR protection in general.

40|$|Concerns about {{counterfeiting}} and piracy {{are becoming}} increasingly widespread and have now taken on an international dimension. Higher standards of intellectual property protection are being set multilaterally and through the inclusion of intellectual property provisions in bilateral trade agreements. The EU Strategy for the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights in Third Countries has undertaken to revisit the approach to the intellectual property rights chapter of bilateral agreements, including the clarification and strengthening of the enforcement clauses. This approach should be reconsidered {{in the light of}} ongoing negotiations on bilateral trade agreements with a number of trading partners such as Korea, India, and ASEAN, while negotiations on bilateral trade with Ukraine and Russia are also being considered. If the Lisbon Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) comes into force, the European Parliament will have a significantly enhanced role to play in the negotiation of such agreements, including the power of veto. In scrutinising and giving consent to agreements, it is recommended that the European Parliament takes account of the following: (1) if intellectual property enforcement provisions are to be included in agreements, this must be done on the basis of adequate evidence on the level of counterfeiting and piracy and its effects; (2) intellectual property rights are private rights and the main responsibility for taking measures to protect and enforce intellectual property rights should lie with individual right holders; (3) the European Parliament should consider carefully the need to balance flexibilities in the TRIPS Agreement with the need for additional provisions in bilateral agreements to fight counterfeiting and piracy; (4) agreements that contain provisions on recourse to bilateral dispute settlement mechanisms risk weakening the <b>multilateral</b> dispute <b>settlement</b> system; (5) provisions in agreements that expand the scope of border measures to cover exports as well as goods in transit or transhipment should not be unnecessarily burdensome and should be subject to the availability of judicial review; (6) the European Parliament should encourage the EU to undertake needs assessments in third countries to ensure that adequate and appropriate technical and financial cooperation is made available on mutually agreed terms and conditions in order to assist with the training of police, customs officers, judiciary and other government officials; (7) it would be advantageous to establish a parliamentary forum or an inter-parliamentary observatory to monitor and assess the impact of bilateral agreements in the fight against counterfeiting and piracy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how {{the two most important}} clearing and settlement systems in Denmark, VP and the Sumclearing, work in practice. Further it analyses, how the legal framework in the Securities Trading Act, STA, based on directive 98 / 26 /EC on settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems works in relation to the functionality of VP and the Sumclearing. The functionality for both systems encompasses net <b>settlement</b> (<b>multilateral</b> netting). The description of the two systems explains not only the multiple batches processing in the systems, but also the systems terms and conditions and the cash settlement in Danmarks Nationalbank. The conclusion is that both systems have entered into fully valid and binding agreements of multilateral netting with its participants according to the requirements in STA. Further the moments, when transfer orders become binding and irrevocable, are identified. In a separate section the important link established between VP Securities Services and Euroclear in Belgium is described, including an elaboration of the cross-system settlement of trades between participants of VP Securities Services and Euroclear, whereby Danish book entry securities electronically are moved to Belgium or back again. Finally the paper analyses what happens in case a participant of VP or the Sumclearing is declared bankrupt. The conclusion is that both VP and the Sumclearing are structured in a way, so the legal and practical consequences of a participant's bankruptcy are predictable in all standard cases. For the other participants this is crucial for the possibility to adapt to the situation.

40|$|Economic {{theory and}} {{empirical}} evidence suggest that governments might usefully intervene in high-technology competition in two ways: First, they could {{act as a}} neutral agent that creates the necessary credibility, commitment and mutual trust among private companies so as to facilitate cooperation in high-risk, high-volume R&D. Second, if — {{in view of the}} externalities involved — an element of subsidization is to be added, this could be done in a nondiscriminatory fashion. A favourable tax treatment of R&D expenditures may be the most appropriate tool to achieve this task. In practice, governments do engage in targeted industrial and technology policies, whether justified on economic grounds or not. As a consequence, the string of trade conflicts in hightech industries that began in the 1980 s is unlikely to end in the near future, unless substantial reforms are undertaken in some crucial areas of the international trade order. Above all, appropriate reform steps should be made with a view to the regulations on (i) subsidies, (ii) structural impediments, and (iii) dumping and anti-dumping. To mitigate the frictions that arise from a subsidization of domestic firms, a new set of rules should be established. The rules should provide that all plans to grant or to alter existing subsidies are to be notified to and approved by the WTO. Moreover, all subsidies should be ranked according to their potential distortional effects on competition and trade. For each category, quantitative limits that constrain the provision of subsidies to a certain fraction of the subsidy base should be set. To facilitate further liberalization steps, a country should be allowed to exceed these limits, if a national subsidy program offers an open access to firms located in third markets. Besides restrictive business practices of private firms, government regulations and technical standards are the most important structural impediments to trade. Existing GATT Articles already offer a multilateral route to conflict resolution in cases of structural impediments. However, this route has not been used by complainants up to now. The so-called "non-violation" clause of Article 23 GATT provides access to a <b>multilateral</b> dispute <b>settlement</b> even if the defending country has not explicitly violated GATT rules. This route should be tested and, if necessary, improved. To reduce the potential for a protectionist abuse of existing anti-dumping regulations, explicit reference to the state of competition in the relevant exporting and importing country markets should be made in anti-dumping investigations. To meet specific anti-trust concerns in hightech competition — notably with respect to network externalities, systems leverage, standardization, and innovation cartels — one might consider adopting the Draft International Antitrust Code (DIAC) that has recently been proposed by an international group of legal experts.

40|$|Excerpt] Following World War II, the United States led {{efforts to}} {{establish}} an open and nondiscriminatory trading system with the expressed goal of raising the economic well-being of all countries and bolstering world peace. These efforts culminated {{in the creation of}} the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1948, a provisional agreement on tariffs and trade rules that governed world trade for 47 years. The World Trade Organization (WTO) succeeded the GATT in 1995 and today serves as a permanent body that administers the rules and agreements negotiated and signed by 153 participating parties, as well as a forum for dispute settlement and negotiations. Section 125 of the Uruguay Round Agreements (P. L. 103 - 465), which is the law that approved and implemented the agreements reached during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, provided that the U. S. Trade Representative (USTR) must submit to Congress every five years a report that analyzes the costs and benefits of continued U. S. participation in the WTO. The USTR submitted its report to Congress on March 1, 2010, triggering a 90 legislative day timetable in which any Member of Congress may introduce a privileged joint resolution withdrawing congressional approval of the WTO Agreement (to date no withdrawal resolution has been introduced in the 111 th Congress). Most observers maintain that U. S. withdrawal from the WTO is at best highly unlikely for both substantive and procedural reasons. Substantively, the withdrawal of U. S. participation could undermine a multilateral system of trade rules and practices, formulated and implemented under U. S. leadership, that on balance has contributed to increased economic prosperity and security at home and abroad. Procedurally, a withdrawal resolution would have to pass both the House and Senate and then surmount a likely Presidential veto via an override with a two-thirds majority vote. Nevertheless, such a resolution provides an opportunity for Members of Congress periodically to debate “whether the WTO is an effective organization” and ways it could better serve U. S. interests. The purpose of this report is to analyze some of the main issues in any debate on U. S. participation in the WTO and to address some of the criticisms leveled at the organization. Academic studies indicate that the United States benefits from broad reductions in trade barriers worldwide, but some workers and industries might not share in those gains. Decisions in the WTO are made by member governments, which determine their negotiating positions, file dispute challenges, and implement their decisions. However, some argue that smaller countries are left out of decision-making and that governments tend to represent the interests of large corporations disproportionately. The United States has been a frequent participant in WTO dispute proceedings, both as a complainant and as a respondent. There have been complaints that countries do not adhere to decisions and that U. S. trade remedy laws have not been judged properly. It is also argued that this <b>multilateral</b> dispute <b>settlement</b> process is unique and that the United States has successfully used the process to advance its economic interests. Certain advocates for the environment, food safety, labor, development, and financial regulation have criticized the WTO. Much of the criticism is based on interpretations of various WTO agreements or rulings that have been controversial. An appendix sets out the legislative procedures for the WTO withdrawal resolution. This report will be updated as events warrant...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Dispute {{settlement}} in the World Trade Organization (WTO) is carried out under the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU). In effect since January 1995, the DSU provides for consultations between disputing parties, panels and appeals, and possible retaliation if a defending party fails {{to comply with a}} WTO decision by an established deadline. Automatic establishment of panels, adoption of panel and appellate reports, and authorization of requests to retaliate, along with deadlines and improved multilateral oversight of compliance, are aimed at producing a more expeditious and effective system than had existed under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). To date, 398 complaints have been filed, approximately half involving the United States as complainant or defendant. Expressing dissatisfaction with WTO dispute settlement results in the trade remedy area, Congress, in the Trade Act of 2002, directed the executive branch to address dispute {{settlement in}} WTO negotiations. WTO Members have been negotiating DSU revisions in the currently stalled Doha Development Round of trade negotiations but no final agreement on the DSU has been reached. Use of the DSU has revealed procedural gaps, particularly affecting the compliance phase of a dispute. These include a failure to coordinate procedures for requesting retaliation with procedures for tasking a WTO panel with determining whether a defending Member has complied in a case and the absence of a procedure for withdrawing trade sanctions imposed by a complaining Member where the defending Member believes it has fulfilled its WTO obligations. As a result, disputing Members have entered into bilateral agreements permitting retaliation and compliance panel processes to progress on an agreed schedule and have initiated new dispute proceedings aimed at removing retaliatory measures. Where a U. S. law or regulation is at issue in a WTO case, the adoption by the WTO of a panel or Appellate Body report finding that the measure violates a WTO agreement does not give the report direct legal effect in this country; thus federal law is not affected until Congress or the executive branch, as the case may be, takes action to remove the offending measure. Where a restrictive foreign trade practice is at issue, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 provides a mechanism by which the United States Trade Representative (USTR) may challenge the measure in a WTO dispute settlement proceeding and authorizes the USTR to take retaliatory action if the defending Member has not complied with the resulting WTO decision. Although Section 301 was challenged in the WTO on the ground that it requires the USTR to act unilaterally in WTO-related trade disputes in violation of DSU provisions requiring resort to <b>multilateral</b> WTO dispute <b>settlement,</b> the United States was ultimately found not to be in violation of its DSU obligations. H. R. 496 (Rangel) would create an Office of the Congressional Trade Enforcer (CTE) that would, inter alia, investigate restrictive foreign trade practices in light of WTO obligations and call on the USTR to initiate WTO dispute proceedings where the CTE finds that WTO violations have occurred; express congressional dissatisfaction with WTO dispute settlement decisions finding that the U. S. practice of “zeroing” (i. e., disregarding non-dumped sales in the calculation of dumping margins) violates the WTO Antidumping Agreement and with decisions of the WTO Appellate Body generally; and place restrictions on the Department of Commerce in implementing the revised antidumping methodology that it adopted in 2007 in response to the WTO “zeroing” decisions. S. 363 (Snowe), would give the U. S. Court of International Trade exclusive jurisdiction to review de novo certain USTR determinations under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which may in some cases involve the initiation and conduct of WTO disputes; the bill would also amend various Section 301 authorities themselves...|$|R
