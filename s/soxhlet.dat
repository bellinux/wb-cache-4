One of the goals was to briefly describe technological and producing methods of selected food - ham, cheese, kephir milk, baby food with fruit, wafer, bread, wholemeal puffed bread and chocolate. Next goal was to evaluate the risks of food consumption with deceptive nutrition labels. In the practical part of this thesis I have determined quantity of saccharides, lipids, proteins and salt in selected food products by standard methods. Simple saccharides were determined by Schoorl's method and starch volume by Ewers's method. Lipids were determined by <b>Soxhlet's</b> extraction and after put through derivatization. In gas chromatograph (GC) were detected fatty acids. Apart from the <b>Soxhlet's</b> extraction was made also extraction according to Hara and Radin (1987) for comparison. Proteins were determined by method using nitrogen according to Kjehdal with adjustments according to Winkler. The amount of salt was detected analytically by argetometric precipitating titration.

2500|$|Developed {{countries}} adopted milk pasteurization {{to prevent}} such disease and loss of life, {{and as a result}} milk is now widely considered one of the safest foods. [...] A traditional form of pasteurization by scalding and straining of cream to increase the keeping qualities of butter was practiced in Great Britain before 1773 and was introduced to Boston in the British Colonies by 1773, although it was not widely practiced in the United States for the next 20 years. It was still being referred to as a [...] "new" [...] process in American newspapers as late as 1802. Pasteurization of milk was suggested by Franz von <b>Soxhlet</b> in 1886. In the early 20th century, Milton Joseph Rosenau established the standards (i.e. low temperature, slow heating at 60°C (140°F) [...] for 20 minutes) for the pasteurization of milk while at the United States Marine Hospital Service, notably in his publication of The Milk Question (1912).

2500|$|Since {{mannitol}} {{is found}} {{in a wide variety}} of natural products, including almost all plants, it can be directly extracted from natural products, rather than chemical or biological syntheses. In fact, in China, isolation from seaweed is the most common form of mannitol production. Mannitol concentrations of plant exudates can range from 20% in seaweeds to 90% in the plane tree. It is a constituent of saw palmetto (Serenoa). Traditionally, mannitol is extracted by the <b>Soxhlet</b> extraction, using ethanol, water, and methanol to steam and then hydrolysis of the crude material. The mannitol is then recrystallized from the extract, generally resulting in yields of about 18% of the original natural product. Another method of extraction is using supercritical and subcritical fluids. These fluids are at such a stage that no difference exists between the liquid and gas stages, so are more diffusive than normal fluids. This is considered to make them much more effective mass transfer agents than normal liquids. The super- or subcritical fluid is pumped through the natural product, and the mostly mannitol product is easily separated from the solvent and minute amount of byproduct. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of olive leaves has been shown to require less solvent per measure of leaf than a traditional extraction — [...] CO2 versus [...] ethanol per [...] olive leaf. Heated, pressurized, subcritical water is even cheaper, and is shown to have dramatically greater results than traditional extraction. It requires only [...] water per [...] of olive leaf, and gives a yield of 76.75% mannitol. Both super- and subcritical extractions are cheaper, faster, purer, and more environmentally friendly than the traditional extraction. However, the required high operating temperatures and pressures are causes for hesitancy in the industrial use of this technique.|$|E

Results: Snacks have high total fat contents, varying between 3. 67 ± 0. 0 and 36. 7 ± 0. 8 g/ 100 g of edible portion. With respect to salt content, the values ranged from 0. 0465 ± 0. 0 (popcorn) to 4. 49 ± 0. 1 g/ 100 g (salty biscuit).

However, when temperature exceeded 140 ℃, both recovery and purity of Syringin started to decrease. The purified Syringin standard and the HPW extracts optimized by a two-factor and three-level RSM were then applied to rat's immune activation (i. e. Macrophage growth rate, NO-released, and Phagocytosis) of rat blood Macrophages. Our results indicated the growth rate and Phagocytosis of Macrophages presented the maximum peak at the 16 mg/L of Syringin when cells were cultured 24, 48, and 72 hours. In the mean time, the release of NO also reached a stable value. Finally, The dosage of 16 mg/L of the HPW extract on the rat Macrophages for 72 hours exhibits a positive phagocytosis effect that correlated with the content of Syringin in the extract, which designed by the RSM operated at the 96 : 1 solvent to solid ratio, 50 psig, 120 ℃, and 45 minutes extraction. 首先探討索氏萃取的時間與溶固比對刺五加水萃物中紫丁香苷含量的影響。實驗數據顯示，台灣刺五加較大陸刺五加含有較多量的紫丁香苷(1. 20 mg/g of solid) ；且由 6 小時萃取 10 克經浸泡 12 小時的刺五加實驗，可獲得 96 : 1 的最適溶固比。由溫度與溶固比為變數的實驗設計法(RSM) 獲知，在 96 : 1 的溶固比， 50 psig，與 45 分鐘的半連續式熱壓水萃取時， 110 ℃至 120 ℃的溫度對刺五加中紫丁香苷的回收率有關鍵性的影響。但升高溫度至 140 ℃，雖有利總產率，可是紫丁香苷的萃出量和純度均大幅降低。 接著，以玻璃棉過濾純化後的標準品紫丁香苷和經過RSM實驗設計所選出的熱壓水萃液，分別對大鼠血液中的巨噬細胞，進行三種免疫實驗(即巨噬細胞的存活率、一氧化氮(NO) 釋放率，與細胞的吞噬能力) 。結果顯示，當添加紫丁香苷的活化組在 16 mg/L的濃度時，在三天的加藥時間內，對巨噬細胞的存活率與吞噬能力均有一個最高值，且對NO的釋放率表現出一個穩定值；相同濃度的熱壓水萃液，表現出經過 72 小時給藥的細胞吞噬能力的提升，確實與加藥溶液中紫丁香苷的含量有正相關。摘要…………………………………………………………………………………… [...] I ABSTRACT………… [...] . ……………………………………………………………….
