Through EC, the audiences achieve <b>shared</b> <b>social</b> <b>meanings</b> and {{understandings of the}} world environment.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to provide}} {{an understanding of the}} historical and contemporary dynamics of India’s foreign policy towards Israel within the context of religious identity from 1947 to 2015. A historical analysis of the relationship between India and Israel exhibits the ways that religious identity has served as a primary factor impeding as well as facilitating relations between the two nations. ^ The analysis was done {{within the context of the}} historical Hindu-Muslim relationship in India and how the legacy of this relationship, in India’s effort to maintain positive relations with the Arab-Muslim world, worked to inhibit relations with Israel prior to normalization in 1992. However, the five years leading up to normalization, and thereafter, the dynamic is reversed with this legacy playing an increasingly progressive role in India-Israel relations via the <b>social</b> construction of <b>shared</b> <b>meanings</b> and identities between India’s Hindu majority with Israel’s Jewish majority. <b>Social</b> construction of <b>shared</b> <b>meanings</b> and identities are based, in part, within an historical/modern-day context of conflict with a minority, religious Other (Islam), and through bridges of connection based in other historical, cultural, social, and religious areas. Formal interviews, archival primary-source analysis of government documents, and secondary-source review were methods employed in the evaluation of the role of religion in India’s foreign policy towards Israel. ^ In conclusion, this dissertation demonstrates the normative and functional effects that religious identities have played, and continue to play, in determining India’s foreign policy towards Israel given the fundamental role religious identity has historically played in the structuring of social perceptions, interactions and worldviews within Indian society up and through the present-day. ...|$|R

Methods: Thirty stakeholders were recruited to participate in 4 interpretive-systemic focus groups. Results: Framework analysis revealed 10 themes, organized into 3 categories, namely, (1) Regulatory Empowerment (interdisciplinary teamwork, resource allocation, culture building, collaborative policy making), (2) Family-Centered Care (continuity of care, family care conference, partnership in care), and (3) Collective Compassion (devotion in care, empathic understanding, compassionate actions). Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of organizational structure, <b>social</b> discourse, and <b>shared</b> <b>meaning</b> in the provision of EoL-ICP in Chinese societies, underscoring the significant triangulation between political, cultural, and spiritual contexts embodied in the experience of dignity...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{concepts}} and words referring to odors and to objects {{that have an}} odor. We argue that odors are an interesting object of study since they are evanescent, and since odor words do not refer to concrete and manipulable objects, but to scents evoked by objects. A second reason why odors are interesting is that some languages, as the Western ones, lack a specific odor lexicon, comparable in richness and variety to the color lexicon, and that performance on odors naming is typically worse than performance in color naming. In this work we discuss three main issues. First, we illustrate literature showing that, even if odor words do not have concrete referents, many languages encode them quite easily: the case of odors suggests that word meaning cannot be exhausted by the relationship with a referent, and {{highlights the importance of}} the <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> of <b>meaning.</b> Second, we have discussed the peculiar status of odor concepts and words. Given their ambiguous status, their simple existence poses problems both to theories according to which concrete and abstract concepts do not differ, and to theories according to which they represent a dichotomy. Finally, we present an experiment in which we show that names of objects evoke their smell, and that these smells evoke approach and avoidance movements, in line with theories according to which words are grounded in both sensorial and motor systems...|$|R
40|$|VR-based {{psychological}} {{therapy is}} largely used in different clinical approaches {{and a variety}} of studies {{can be found in the}} literature about the experience of VR-therapy sessions. Usually, such studies are focused on a user's private experience. With this contribution, we present a perspective to improve VRsession definition towards a "co-defined reality", abandoning both artifact and user–artifact centered interaction in favour of a "situated and context sensible" interaction analysis. Theoretical background is based on an ethnometodological approach: this perspective gives evidence of how people, in specific <b>social</b> situations, produce <b>shared</b> <b>meanings.</b> Within such theoretical framework, an analysis has been conducted with reference to two different dimensions. From a strictly ergonomic point of view, main results are related to the improvement of VR training sessions and to patient integration in the framework of the therapeutic protocol, to avoid interruptions and breakdowns. With reference to the sense of presence, we investigated how therapist and patient can populate with “others” and “meanings” the co-defined environment and how a VE's level of interactivity influences the quality of the immersive experience. Main findings highlight the sequential and dialogical process of VR fruition and could help in VR technical design process...|$|R
40|$|The global {{construction}} environment offers stakeholders a {{range of}} opportunities but is characterised by {{a high level of}} risks and uncertainty. Internationalisation is a relatively new field of research in the AEC sector and past research has largely focused on explaining the behaviour of the industry itself. To date there has been little research investigating the client 2 ̆ 7 s leadership role. Much effort has been placed on positioning clients towards overall industry performance improvement, however, with little emphasis on the client 2 ̆ 7 s capacity to undertake their role. Clients establish the decision-making environment through key early critical decisions including procurement strategy and team membership. To a large extent they establish a unique culture that project team members need to work within and make decisions, which is the social and cultural embedding of the economic activities on projects. This theoretical paper is positioned within a PhD study which undertakes a cultural political economy perspective to investigate the client 2 ̆ 7 s central role in setting the boundaries within which decisions affecting budgets, quality, design, project organisational structure and team membership throughout the project lifecycle come to be made. A conceptual model for client leadership on international projects is developed based upon two contextual indicators which seeks to describe and explain the economic decisions clients make, which are deeply embedded in <b>social</b> relationships, <b>shared</b> <b>meanings</b> and cultural norms and the associated power and influence clients have on the political economy of international design and construction practice.

40|$|The {{archaeology}} {{of religion}} is underdeveloped. Research into particular regions and periods favours specific theoretical paradigms and research questions. These problems are compounded by theory-laden archaeological investigations’ tendency to present only vague relationships between data and the theories utilised. Meanwhile, studies of religion in Ancient Israel has been overwhelmingly carried out by textual scholars, resulting in text-led, homogenising reconstructions of religious communities. Where archaeology is consulted it largely serves only to confirm or deny textually attested practices. To tackle these problems this dissertation develops a new theoretical model that allows the explicit connection of archaeological data to theory-laden interpretations, highlights the embeddedness of religion in day-to-day routines, and foregrounds the individual agent whilst allowing societal conclusions. This original and innovative framework is then used to present a reconstruction of Iron II Negev religion as a highly contextual phenomenon, interacted with idiosyncratically by individuals whilst retaining <b>shared</b> <b>social</b> <b>meanings</b> reproduced and developed through everyday experiences...|$|R
40|$|PhD 2011 QMThis thesis, {{grounded}} in feminist sociology and queer theory, examines sex, sexuality, and desire in naturally occurring synchronous conversations within a non-sexually themed online community. Although {{the community is}} rooted in computing culture (i. e., a multi-user domain) and is not sexual in scope or purpose, sex talk is prevalent and persistent in the corpus. Seventy-five conversational logs, each covering 24 hours of conversations, are analysed using qualitative sociolinguistic discourse analysis. The findings demonstrate that the participants engage in sexual conversations (e. g., automated sexual commands, joking, self-disclosure, cybersex) that {{make use of the}} spatial and technical resources available to them, and that there are clear boundaries in the language used for sexual conversations. Sexual conversations are found across virtual spaces in this community and are based on in-group talk, often to create <b>social</b> belonging and <b>shared</b> <b>meaning</b> between speakers. While participants sometimes challenge existing social discourses of sexuality when adopting group-specific norms and narrative styles, they often enact them, particularly in regards to heteronormative heterosexuality and gender. This thesis proposes that sex and sexuality can be seen in relation to the social comprehensive, which includes individual agency, social infrastructure, everyday experience, discourses, and <b>shared</b> <b>meaning.</b> The framework underscores the relevance of sex and its relationship to the larger social world in spontaneous and everyday conversations about sex and desire from an online community. It contributes to our limited scholarly knowledge of how people discuss sex, allowing for the examination of the discourses that emerge in and through speakersâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 words, the stories that they tell, how they are told, and to whom...|$|R
40|$|Although {{developmental}} researchers {{endorse a}} multifaceted view of early communication, where language, non-verbal behaviour and socio-affective exchange contribute concurrently to the <b>social</b> construction of <b>shared</b> <b>meanings,</b> past studies of social development usually focused on component parts of interpersonal communication. This research integrates three aspects of communicative exchange {{in order to}} clarify stylistic differences among 30 -month-old children. To achieve this objective, data from three different coding procedures (speech acts, information content and affective states) were coded for 52 children and then merged {{on the basis of}} onset time. Fifteen distinct descriptors were identified in the analyses of tri-modal communicative processes. Three different communicative styles were identified in person-centred cluster analyses of these descriptors. Analysis of variance revealed that 13 of the constructs significantly differentiated the groups. The first group was characterised as highly engaged in play but with low affect expression; these children’s mode of communication centred more on mother’s feelings and personal references. Children in the second cluster asked more questions and made more statements about objects. Finally, children in cluster three engaged in more complex evaluative discourse while orienting maternal behaviour to ongoing activity. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of a qualitative, holistic approach to the study of diversity in children’s communicative performance and in contemporary research on early learning...|$|R

The risk of communication breakdowns increases due to cultural and organizational differences grounded in the geographical distribution of the participants.

In this paper, we address the complexity of building <b>shared</b> <b>meaning.</b> We examine the communication breakdowns that occurred in two globally distributed virtual teams by providing an analytical distinction of the organizational context as the foundation for building <b>shared</b> <b>meaning</b> at three levels. Also we investigate communication breakdowns that can be attributed to differences in lifeworld structures, organizational structures, and work process structures within a virtual team. We find that all communication breakdowns are manifested and experienced by the participants at the work process level; however, resolving breakdowns may require critical reflection at other levels. Where previous research argues that face-to-face interaction is an important variable for virtual team performance, our empirical observations reveal that communication breakdowns related to a lack of <b>shared</b> <b>meaning</b> at the lifeworld level often becomes more salient when the participants are co-located than when geographically distributed.

In our study, nurses and patient care technicians (PCTs) on both hospital units faced these same occupational differences, served the same patient population, worked under the same management and organizational structure, and had the same pressures, goals, and organizational collaboration tools available to them. But nurses and PCTs on one unit successfully collaborated while those on the other did not. We demonstrate that a social structure characterized by cross-cutting demographics between occupational groups—in which occupational membership is uncorrelated with demographic group membership—can loosen attachment to the occupational identity and status order. This allows members of cross-occupational dyads, in our case nurses and PCTs, to draw on other <b>shared</b> <b>social</b> identities, such as shared race, age, or immigration status, in their interactions.
