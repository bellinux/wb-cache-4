5000|$|According to Taleb in <b>Silent</b> <b>Risk,</b> {{the term}} {{should be called}} [...] "payoff" [...] to reflect the {{importance}} of the payoff function of the underlying probability distribution, rather than the distribution itself. The term is meant to refer to an investment returns profile {{in which there is a}} high probability of a small gain, and a small probability of a very large loss, which more than outweighs the gains. In these situations the expected value is very much less than zero, but this fact is camouflaged by the appearance of low risk and steady returns. It is a combination of kurtosis risk and skewness risk: overall returns are dominated by extreme events (kurtosis), which are to the downside (skew).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Since {{children}} have frequent {{contact with the}} health care system, while their young parents very often do not, screening children routinely might represent an important opportunity to target the young parents. We examined whether cardiovascular risk factors in children predicted the risk of their parents. METHODS: Five silent (hypertension, high triglycerides, high LDL-, high non-HDL-, and low HDL-cholesterol) and two clinical apparent (general and central adiposity) risk factors were compared in 2720 child-parent pairs from a well-defined sample of German elementary school children and parents. RESULTS: All clinical apparent and <b>silent</b> <b>risk</b> factors were significantly correlated between children and their parents, and most pronounced were those for three <b>silent</b> <b>risk</b> factors: HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol (correlation coefficient r= 0. 26 - 0. 28). In multivariate models, adjusting for age and gender, child general and abdominal adiposity conferred a significant 2. 9 -fold and a 2. 6 -fold enhanced odds among parents of carrying the same risk factors. Similarly, abnormal LDL, HDL, or non-HDL among children conferred a significant 3. 0 -fold, 2. 0 -fold, or 2. 9 -fold increased odds among parents. The odds of parents appeared stronger if the child had the same sex only for clinical apparent risk factors, and most pronounced for general adiposity. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular risk screening in children may serve as a case finding strategy for early prevention in high risk families. The inclusion of <b>silent</b> <b>risk</b> factors in a screening program of school children may be warranted for the high prevalence among children and enhanced case-finding potential among parents...|$|E

40|$|Silent brain {{infarction}} is a cerebral ischaemic event {{evident on}} brain imaging without any clinical symptom. Silent brain infarction is often detected in apparently healthy, elderly people {{and in different}} selected patient groups as well. Lately, several {{studies were carried out}} in order to identify the clinical conditions leading to silent brain infarction. A large number of clinical and paraclinical parameters were found to increase silent brain infarction prevalence, and the continuously growing list of risk factors revealed that the majority of them are similar to those related to stroke. Accordingly, some consider silent brain infarction the preclinical stage of clinically overt stroke. This point of view emphasizes the early recognition and management of <b>silent</b> brain infarction-related <b>risk</b> factors, and a great need for comparative studies, which could elicit the most sensitive indicators of the increased <b>silent</b> brain infarction <b>risk,</b> especially the ones that could be cost-effectively screened in the large populations as well...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: It {{appears that}} some {{risk factors for}} {{coronary}} heart diseases (CHD) initiate their influence in the childhood period and their clinical complications start to take effect in adulthood. It is possible that adolescent active or sedentary boys, have other inflammatory <b>silent</b> <b>risk</b> factors of CHD, in addition to routine risk factors such as lipid profile. However, the scientific data available {{about the effects of}} aerobic exercise, physical fitness and nutritional status on the biochemistry indices of cardiovascular system (CVS) inflammatory response, such as homocysteine (HST), fibrinogen (FBG) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are contradictory. Methods: 42 volunteer boys from the city of Tehran (age: 10 - 14 years, BMI: 11 - 17 kg/m 2 daily energy intake: 2477 - 2762 kcal) participated in the study and were divided in 3 groups of football players, swimmers and control group. The athletes had regular trainings for the last 3 year. Results: ANOVA-one way analysis of variance indicated that serum HST concentration in the swimmers (12. 01 ± 2. 08 mmol/l) was significantly lower than HST levels of the football players (11. 14 ± 2. 8 mmol/l) (F= 3. 8, P= 0. 31). The FBG levels did not show any significant difference among athletic groups. Moreover, CRP concentrations of different groups were not significantly changed. Conclusion: Prolonged swimming training, BMI magnitude, initial physiological fitness level and the quantity of weekly training (not work intensity) could probably affect the biochemical markers (nontraditional risk factors) of cardiovascular system in young athletes...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Acute {{and chronic}} aortic syndromes are {{associated}} with substantial morbidity and mortality. <b>Silent</b> <b>risk</b> factors such as arterial hypertension and aortic root dilatation can {{increase the likelihood of}} aortic dissection or rupture. The relationship between arterial hypertension and the dimensions of the aortic root dimension is a topic of active debate. Materials and methods: We reviewed the literature on the physiopathology, diagnosis, natural history, and management of thoracic aortic aneurysms. Results: Biological variables influencing the size of the aorta include age, sex, body surface area, pressure values, and stroke volume. Pathologic enlargement of the thoracic aorta can be caused by genetic, degenerative, inflammatory, traumatic, or toxic factors. Studies investigating the correlation between aortic dimensions and arterial pressures (diastolic, systolic, or pulse) have produced discordant results. Discussion: Classically, emphasis has been placed on the importance of hypertension-related degeneration of the medial layer of the aortic wall, which leads to dilatation of the thoracic aorta, reduced aortic wall compliance, and increased pulse pressures. However, there are no published data that demonstrate unequivocally the existence of a pathogenetic correlation between arterial hypertension and aortic root dilatation. Furthermore, {{there is no evidence that}} antihypertensive therapy is effective in the management of nonsyndromic forms of aortic root dilatation. An interesting branch of research focuses on the importance of genetic predisposition in the pathogenesis of thoracic aortic aneurysms. Different genetic backgrounds could explain differences in the behaviour of aortic walls exposed to the same hemodynamic stress. Further study is needed to evaluate these focal physiopathological aspects...|$|E
40|$|Background - In {{patients}} with autoimmune disease, anti-Ro/SSA antibodies (anti-Ro/SSA) {{are responsible for}} a novel autoimmune-associated long-QT syndrome by targeting the hERG potassium channel and inhibiting the related current (I Kr). Because anti-Ro/SSA are also present in {{a significant proportion of}} healthy subjects and may be associated with torsades de pointes (TdP) arrhythmia, we tested the hypothesis that anti-Ro/SSA may represent a <b>silent</b> <b>risk</b> factor in patients developing TdP. Methods and Results - Twenty-five consecutive patients who experienced TdP were prospectively collected independent of ongoing therapies and concomitant diseases. Anti-Ro/SSA were detected by fluoroenzyme immunoassay, immuno-Western blotting, and line-blot immunoassay. Purified IgGs from anti-Ro/SSA-positive and anti-Ro/SSA-negative patients were tested on I Kr using HEK 293 cells stably expressing the hERG channel. As expected, in TdP patients, many known corrected QT interval-prolonging risk factors were simultaneously present, including hypokalemia that was the most common (52 %). Anti-Ro/SSA were present in 60 % of the subjects, mostly the anti-Ro/SSA- 52 -kD subtype detected by immuno-Western blotting only. A history of autoimmune disease was found in only 2 of anti-Ro/SSA-positive patients. Experimental data demonstrated that purified anti-Ro/SSA-positive IgGs significantly inhibited I Kr and cross reacted with hERG-channel proteins. Moreover, anti-Ro/SSA-positive sera exhibited high reactivity with a peptide corresponding to the hERG-channel pore-forming region. Conclusions - Anti-Ro/SSA may represent a clinically silent novel risk factor for TdP development via an autoimmune-mediated electrophysiological interference with the hERG channel. We propose that TdP patients may benefit from specific anti-Ro/SSA testing {{even in the absence of}} autoimmune diseases as immunomodulating therapies may be effective in shortening corrected QT interval and reducing TdP recurrence risk...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{creatine}} supplementation {{continues to}} be a hotly debated and relevant topic for health care professionals, amid its widespread use among young people and the mass of research with inconclusive or questionable outcomes. While the argument that creatine is an effective anaerobic ergogenic aid has a wealth of evidence, the case for the safety of its long term use does not. This fact is worrisome given the cavalier manner in which many use the supplement, as considerations of genetic predispositions to kidney disease, underlying occult or known disease states, or even metabolically competing medications are often excluded from the decision of whether, how much and for how long to use the creatine supplement.

40|$|Silent {{ischaemia}} is a common, under-recognised {{condition that}} {{is associated with}} an adverse prognosis. It is a marker of significant underlying coronary artery disease and therefore of future cardio-vascular events. It is more prevalent in the diabetic popu-lation and diagnosis is usually made by a positive exercise tolerance test, positive myocardial perfusion scan or stress echo. The basis of treatment, in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects, is risk factor modification and coronary revascularisation of prognostically important coronary disease. Diabetic patients should receive risk fac-tor modification {{even in the absence of}} ischaemia. Detection of silent ischaemia allows patients with prognostically important disease to be offered further treatment.

40|$|I am {{fascinated with}} the {{different}} perceptions of risk in qualitative research. Insti-tutional Review Boards (IRBs) differ in their requirements for review of qualita-tive proposals that vary from expedited review (indicating that the risks for partici-pants are no greater than in everyday life) to full review (implying {{that there may be}} some risk of harm to participants). In the 10 years of publication of QHR, some authors have referred to the potential risks to investigators inherent in fieldwork (mainly to physical safety [see, e. g., Patterson, Gregory, & Thorne, 1999]) and in work-ing with qualitative data (mainly emotional distress [see, e. g., Gregory, Russell, & Phillips, 1997]). However, we have been <b>silent</b> about the <b>risk</b> to participants—possi-bly because if the principles of informal consent are adhered to and promises of ano-nymity and confidentiality respected, the risks are very low indeed.

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Studies have {{demonstrated}} that metabolic complications from child obesity, although <b>silent,</b> increase the <b>risk</b> of development of cardiovascular diseases in adulthood. The present paper sought to describe the prevalence of overweight/obesity and analyze the possible relationship between obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors among children and adolescents. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study, conducted in a university. METHODS: The study included 564 children and adolescents, aged 8 to 17 years. Body mass index and waist circumference were used to evaluate obesity. Other cardiovascular risk factors were evaluated, like systolic and diastolic blood pressure, glycemia, triglycerides and total cholesterol. Descriptive analysis was used for sample characterization, the chi-square test for categorical variables and Pearson's linear correlation for evaluating the relationship between obesity indicators and other cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: High prevalence of overweight/obesity was found among the schoolchildren (25. 3 % among the boys and 25. 6 % among the girls), along with abdominal obesity (19. 0 %). The overweight/obese schoolchildren presented higher percentages for the pressure and biochemical indicators, compared with underweight and normal-weight schoolchildren. Body mass index and waist circumference showed a weak correlation with the variables of age and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P < 0. 001), {{but there was no}} correlation between these obesity indices and biochemical variables. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of overweight/obesity and its relationship with other cardiovascular risk factors demonstrate {{that it is necessary to}} develop intervention and prevention strategies from childhood onwards, in order to avoid development of chronic-degenerative diseases in adulthood...|$|R
40|$|Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is {{a disease}} of early onset {{which can lead to}} {{significant}} morbidity. In 2012, Single Hub and Access point for pediatric Rheumatology in Europe (SHARE) was launched with the aim of optimising and disseminating diagnostic and management regimens for children and young adults with rheumatic diseases. The objective was to establish recommendations for FMF focusing on provision of diagnostic tools for inexperienced clinicians particularly regarding interpretation of MEFV mutations. Evidence-based recommendations were developed using the European League against Rheumatism standard operating procedure. An expert committee of paediatric rheumatologists de fined search terms for the systematic literature review. Two independent experts scored articles for validity and level of evidence. Recommendations derived from the literature were evaluated by an online survey and statements with less than 80 % agreement were reformulated. Subsequently, all recommendations were discussed at a consensus meeting using the nominal group technique and were accepted if more than 80 % agreement was reached. The literature search yielded 3386 articles, of which 25 were considered relevant and scored for validity and level of evidence. In total, 17 articles were scored valid and used to formulate the recommendations. Eight recommendations were accepted with 100 % agreement after the consensus meeting. Topics covered were clinical versus genetic diagnosis of FMF, genotype - phenotype correlation, genotype - age at onset correlation, <b>silent</b> carriers and <b>risk</b> of amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis, and role of the specialist in FMF diagnosis.

40|$|In the United States, Prostate {{cancer is}} the most commontumourinmen,withanexpected 192. 280 new cases and 27. 360 deaths {{estimated}} in 2009 [1]. About 81 % of patients with prostate cancer are over 65 years of age. Prostate cancer is a biologically heterogeneous neoplasm in which, especially in the elderly, some forms remain <b>silent</b> and with <b>risk</b> of disease-treatment. Moreover, this population may not receive optimal therapies for their disease, if decisions are based only on their chronological age. Health status, more than age, {{is a major factor}} affecting individual life expectancy. Comorbidity is the key predictor of health status, and should weigh more on the treatment decision than age alone. Other important parameters to consider in the elderly are the degree of dependence in activities of daily living, the nutritional status and the presence or not of a geriatric syndrome. The androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) has become an integral piece of the armamentarium for treating prostate cancer in neoadjuvant, adjuvant and palliative therapy [2]. The impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) following ADT induction has gained significant clinical attention. Several series documented an association between ADT and declining HRQOL [3]. Treatment of hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer with Docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks (3 W) in combination with daily prednisone has been shown to prolong survival and to have the same efficacy in healthy elderly as in younger patients [4].

40|$|The overall {{prevalence}} of CAD among pa-tients with diabetes {{is higher than}} in non-diabetic patients and may {{be as high as}} 55 % among patients with diabetes [1]. Furthermore, CAD represents {{the leading cause of death}} in patients with diabetes [2, 3]. Most of the published studies present data on type 2 diabetes (more than 90 % of all diabetic patients). Less data is available for type 1 diabetes. Therefore, most of our statements also focus on type 2 diabetes. Since diabetics often present with silent myo-cardial ischaemia, they lack an important clinical “warning symptom ” of their CAD. Data from the Framingham Study suggest that asymptomatic pa-tients with multiple risk factors have an annual car-diac death rate of approximately 3 % [2, 4]. These findings from the literature put forward several questions regarding diabetes mellitus and CAD: why is myocardial ischaemia often silent in these patients? How can it be detected? What is its rel-evance? And how should it be managed? The pres-ent review will address these issues and tries to pro-vide guidelines on how to risk stratify and treat these patients. Coronary artery disease (CAD) represents the leading cause of death in diabetic patients. Silent myocardial ischaemia more often occurs in diabet-ics than in non-diabetics.

40|$|Background: Risk {{assessment}} for fast growing burden of cardiovascular diseases {{is very important}} and dif- ficult. As a response to this challenge, in particular, genetic risk factors which potentially modify risk, we conducted a survey of primary data registry of Shiraz Heart Study on integration and application of family history data in prevention of cardiovascular disorders. Method: This study is a longitudinal cohort project to be extended from subpopulations of different job groups to the community. Results: Parental family history of MI, diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia (HPL), hypertension (HTN) was reported more frequently among females than males. Histories of MI, DM, HPL, and HTN in both parents were respectively positive in 2. 6 %, 2 %, 4. 6 %, and 7. 9 % of the participants. Odd ratios (OR) for risk of MI from family history of MI were 2. 7; risk of DM from family history of DM 4. 5; risk of HPL from family history of HPL 2. 04; and risk of HTN from family history HTN 4. 7. Also, family history of MI modifies risk of HPL (OR= 1. 7, P< 0. 0001); and family history of DM modifies risk of HPL (OR= 2. 04, P< 0. 0001).

40|$|Infective {{endocarditis}} (IE) is {{a life-threatening}} disease. Cerebral embolization complicates {{the course in}} 10 - 40 % of IE episodes. Aims of study were to investigate the frequency of cerebrovascular complications (CVC) in left-sided IE {{and the influence of}} protective and risk factors with focus on antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy. CVC rate was examined by repeated magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and by assaying levels of brain damage markers in cerebrospinal fluid in 60 IE patients in paper I. The overall CVC frequency was 65 %, with 35 % of the patients experiencing neurological symptoms and 30 % characterized as having clinically <b>silent</b> CVC. The <b>risk</b> of neurological deterioration during cardiac surgery after established cerebral embolism was low. In paper II the relationship between symptomatic CVC and established use of antiplatelet therapy was evaluated in 684 definite left-sided IE episodes. Antiplatelet agents were used by 23 % of the patients. These patients were older and more often had a history of congestive heart failure. In 25 % of all episodes a CVC was seen. There was no statistically significant difference in CVC rate between patients with and without previously established antiplatelet therapy (24 % vs. 25 %, n. s.). Twelve-month mortality was significantly higher for patients on previously established antiplatelet therapy in the univariable analysis (34 % vs. 24 %, OR 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 4), but after adjustment for covariables the use of antiplatelet therapy was no longer a risk factor. The association between ongoing warfarin therapy and CVC incidence in native valve endocarditis (NVE) was analyzed in paper III. Out of 587 NVE episodes 8 % were seen in patients using warfarin on admission. Patients on warfarin suffered from CVC significantly less frequently than patients not on warfarin (6 % vs. 26 %, 0. 2 95 % CI 0. 06 - 0. 6). In a multivariable model S. aureus etiology (adjusted OR [aOR] 6. 3, 95 % CI 3. 8 - 10. 4) and vegetation length (aOR 1. 04, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 07) were associated with higher CVC frequency.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the whistle-blowing decisions of government internal auditors {{in response to}} individual and collective corruption occurring within government internal audit units. An auditor is simultaneously a role-prescribed and non-role-prescribed whistle-blower that may behave hypocritically. On the one hand, auditors may be intolerant of and report any corruption taking place within their audit clients. On the other hand, they may display an unwillingness {{to blow the whistle}} on corruption committed by their fellow auditors in which they and the recipients of whistle-blowing information may be a part of or beneficiaries of the wrongdoing. To examine how, why and what factors influence their whistle-blowing decisions, we utilised two approaches: the whistle-blowing intentions through the use of case scenarios and actual wwhistleblowing relying on the self-reported cases. Mixed methods of surveys, interviews and focus group discussions were conducted in seven government internal audit units. Seeing whistle-blowing as a constructive behaviour {{for the benefit of the}} organisation involving an ethical dilemma, we integrated the prosocial organisational behaviour and ethical decision-making perspectives of whistle-blowing to develop a three-phases of whistle-blowing decision. In phase 1, the potential whistle-blowers evaluated the wrongfulness and the seriousness of the wrongdoing in accordance with their ethical sensitivity and evaluated the existence of responsibility to act to stop the wrongdoing. In phase 2, they evaluated the organisation responsiveness and the existence of the demoralising situation. In phase 3, they assessed their personal responsibility, identified alternative decisions according to his/her ethical competence, calculated the cost and the benefit of each alternative and decide to blow or not to blow the whistle depended on their ethical perseverance. The study demonstrates that ethical judgement, moderated by the perceived seriousness and organisational commitment, significantly influenced the whistle-blowing intentions. while taking the ethical climate, wrongdoer’s power status and whistle-blower’s job level into consideration. The study found the domination of informal hidden values instead of formal written values and the occurrence of the process of normalisation of corruption that led to the destructive act of silence. They reduced the ethical sensitivity towards the wrongfulness and the seriousness of the corruption, diffused the responsibility to blow the whistle and created the demoralising situation. The organisations were not responsive. The whistle-blowing information was ignored and leaders often promoted an attitude of silent acquiescence by rewarding <b>silent</b> observers. The <b>risk</b> of whistle-blowing appeared greater than the expected benefit of being a submissive silent observer. When whistle-blowing information was eventually received, leaders rectified the problem informally outside of official procedures. The rules were upheld only when there was external pressure on the leaders. Through this, the wrongdoer will feel secure and the whistle-blower will perceive that the act of whistleblowing is not acceptable. The combination of the unwillingness to blow the whistle and the process of the normalisation of organisational corruption may create a vicious cycle of corruption in and by organisations. On the contrary, whistle-blowing occurred when the potential whistle-blowers perceived that the act of whistle-blowing is a constructive behaviour supported by the organisation’s culture and leadership. Whistle-blowing legislation alone may not be sufficient to motivate employees to blow the whistle particularly in Indonesia where in-group collectivism and power distance are relatively high. ...|$|R

Chronic blood transfusions may reduce the risk of vaso-occlusion and stroke by diluting the proportion of sickled cells in the circulation. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and last updated in 2013. Objectives To assess risks and benefits of chronic blood transfusion regimens in people with sickle cell disease for primary and secondary stroke prevention (excluding silent cerebral infarcts). Search methods We searched for relevant trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases; all searches current to 04 April 2016. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 25 April 2016. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing red blood cell transfusions as prophylaxis for stroke in people with sickle cell disease to alternative or standard treatment. There were no restrictions by outcomes examined, language or publication status. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and the risk of bias and extracted data. Main results We included five trials (660 participants) published between 1998 and 2016. Four of these trials were terminated early. The vast majority of participants had the haemoglobin (Hb) SS form of sickle cell disease. Three trials compared regular red cell transfusions to standard care in primary prevention of stroke: two in children with no previous long-term transfusions; and one in children and adolescents on long-term transfusion. Two trials compared the drug hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) and phlebotomy to long-term transfusions and iron chelation therapy: one in primary prevention (children); and one in secondary prevention (children and adolescents). The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate across different outcomes according to GRADE methodology. This was due to the trials being at a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, indirectness and imprecise outcome estimates. Red cell transfusions versus standard care Children with no previous long-term transfusions Long-term transfusions probably reduce the incidence of clinical stroke in children with a higher risk of stroke (abnormal transcranial doppler velocities or previous history of <b>silent</b> cerebral infarct), <b>risk</b> ratio 0. 12 (95 % confidence interval 0. 03 to 0. 49) (two trials, 326 participants), moderate quality evidence. Long-term transfusions may: reduce the incidence of other sickle cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 0. 24 (95 % confidence interval 0. 12 to 0. 48)) (two trials, 326 participants); increase quality of life (difference estimate - 0. 54, 95 % confidence interval - 0. 92 to - 0. 17) (one trial, 166 participants); but make little or no difference to IQ scores (least square mean: 1. 7, standard error 95 % confidence interval - 1. 1 to 4. 4) (one trial, 166 participants), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether long-term transfusions: reduce the risk of transient ischaemic attacks, Peto odds ratio 0. 13 (95 % confidence interval 0. 01 to 2. 11) (two trials, 323 participants); have any effect on all-cause mortality, no deaths reported (two trials, 326 participants); or increase the risk of alloimmunisation, risk ratio 3. 16 (95 % confidence interval 0. 18 to 57. 17) (one trial, 121 participants), very low quality evidence. Children and adolescents with previous long-term transfusions (one trial, 79 participants) We are very uncertain whether continuing long-term transfusions reduces the incidence of: stroke, risk ratio 0. 22 (95 % confidence interval 0. 01 to 4. 35); or all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 8. 00 (95 % confidence interval 0. 16 to 404. 12), very low quality evidence. Several review outcomes were only reported in one trial arm (sickle cell disease-related complications, alloimmunisation, transient ischaemic attacks). The trial did not report neurological impairment, or quality of life. Hydroxyurea and phlebotomy versus red cell transfusions and chelation Neither trial reported on neurological impairment, alloimmunisation, or quality of life. Primary prevention, children (one trial, 121 participants) Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may have little or no effect on liver iron concentrations, mean difference - 1. 80 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (95 % confidence interval - 5. 16 to 1. 56), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy has any effect on: risk of stroke (no strokes); all-cause mortality (no deaths); transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 1. 02 (95 % confidence interval 0. 21 to 4. 84); or other sickle cell disease-related complications (acute chest syndrome, risk ratio 2. 03 (95 % confidence interval 0. 39 to 10. 69)), very low quality evidence. Secondary prevention, children and adolescents (one trial, 133 participants) Switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy may: increase the risk of sickle cell disease-related serious adverse events, risk ratio 3. 10 (95 % confidence interval 1. 42 to 6. 75); but have little or no effect on median liver iron concentrations (hydroxyurea, 17. 3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (interquartile range 10. 0 to 30. 6)); transfusion 17. 3 mg Fe/g dry-weight liver (interquartile range 8. 8 to 30. 7), low quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether switching to hydroxyurea and phlebotomy: increases the risk of stroke, risk ratio 14. 78 (95 % confidence interval 0. 86 to 253. 66); or has any effect on all-cause mortality, Peto odds ratio 0. 98 (95 % confidence interval 0. 06 to 15. 92); or transient ischaemic attacks, risk ratio 0. 66 (95 % confidence interval 0. 25 to 1. 74), very low quality evidence. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence for managing adults, or children who do not have HbSS sickle cell disease. In children who are at higher risk of stroke and have not had previous long-term transfusions, there is moderate quality evidence that long-term red cell transfusions reduce the risk of stroke, and low quality evidence they also reduce the risk of other sickle cell disease-related complications. In primary and secondary prevention of stroke there is low quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy has little or no effect on the liver iron concentration. In secondary prevention of stroke there is low-quality evidence that switching to hydroxyurea with phlebotomy increases the risk of sickle cell disease-related events. All other evidence in this review is of very low quality...|$|R
