40|$|SUMMARY The {{distribution}} of the three known species of Onchocerca in Australian cattle is described. O. gutturosa {{was found in the}} ligamentum nuchae, on the <b>scapular</b> <b>cartilage</b> and in the hip, stifle and shoulder regions. Nodules of O. gibsoni were found in the brisket***, stifle and hip regions, while O. lienalis occurred along the gastrosplenic ligament and above the xiphisternum. O. gutturosa is potentially the most important species to the meat industry since it is widely distributed in the carcase and is easily missed during inspection. Trimming procedures which could be used to ensure removal of known sites of infection are outlined. Copyrigh...|$|E
40|$|Columnar and hypertrophic {{zones of}} calf <b>scapular</b> <b>cartilage</b> were studied {{before and after}} {{extraction}} with 3 M guanidinium chloride (GuCl) and digestion with enzymes which degrade various components of the extracellular matrix. Morphologic and chemical analysis {{suggests that there are}} at least two anatomic pools of proteoglycan in this tissue. One, which resides between collagen fibrils, is extractable with GuCl. Another appears attached to collagen by strong bonds and is apparently not extractable with GuCl. This type of collagen-proteoglycan relationship is possibly restricted to epiphyseal cartilage. The morphology of the lacuna is different in the columnar and hypertrophic zones. Proteoglycans in the distal hypertrophic zone are less resistant to GuCl extraction...|$|E
40|$|Conservation {{laryngeal}} surgery {{has been limited}} by difficulties with partial resection of the cricoid. Numerous options have been suggested that include temporoparietal flaps, free cartilage grafts, radial forearm free tissue transfers, and tracheal autotransplantation with vascular carriers. The authors present a one-stage procedure for {{the reconstruction of the}} cricoid cartilage based on the thoracodorsal artery scapular tip (Tdast) autogenous trans-plant that uses the curved tip of the scapula and does not create a secondary tracheal defect. Because the Tdast is a vascularized graft it may withstand radiation treatment.

40|$|ABSTRACT Cartilage-derived {{growth factor}} (CDGF), a {{cationic}} polypeptide of ~ 18, 000 mol wt, was prepared from bovine articular cartilage; other sources were bovine and human <b>scapular</b> and costal <b>cartilage.</b> Previous {{studies have shown}} that CDGF stimulates the proliferation of cultured mouse fibroblasts as well as chondrocytes and endothelial cells from various sources. In this study, CDGF was shown to stimulate dose-dependently the accumulation of DNA and collagen by rat embryo fibroblasts and a population of fibroblasts derived from granulation tissue. CDGF also stimulated the proliferation of cultured bovine capillary endothelial cells dose-dependently. To evaluate the effects of CDGF in vivo, we implanted polyvinyl alcohol sponges subcutaneously in rats. 6 d postimplantation, sponges were injected with 300 pg of partially purified CDGF, a dose which takes into account the cell numbers in the sponges as compared with cell cultures. CDGF rapidly disappeared from the sponges and only ~ 10 % of the initial dose was present at 4 h. Despite its transient presence, CDGF caused a relative increase in sponge DNA content of 2. 6 -fold at 48 h and 2. 4 -fold at 72 h. We repeated the sponge experiment by using 500 -ng injections of CDGF purified to near homogeneity by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Purified CDGF caused significant increases in spong...|$|R

CDGF also stimulated the proliferation of cultured bovine capillary endothelial cells dose-dependently. To evaluate the effects of CDGF in vivo, we implanted polyvinyl alcohol sponges subcutaneously in rats. 6 d postimplantation, sponges were injected with 300 micrograms of partially purified CDGF, a dose which takes into account the cell numbers in the sponges as compared with cell cultures. CDGF rapidly disappeared from the sponges and only approximately 10 % of the initial dose was present at 4 h. Despite its transient presence, CDGF caused a relative increase in sponge DNA content of 2. 6 -fold at 48 h and 2. 4 -fold at 72 h. We repeated the sponge experiment by using 500 - ng injections of CDGF purified to near homogeneity by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Purified CDGF caused significant increases in sponge collagen, protein, and DNA content at 48 and 72 h after a single injection. The effects of CDGF were abolished by heat and unaffected by reduction of disulfide linkages. Morphologically, CDGF did not evoke an inflammatory response, and its effect on proliferating endothelial cells and fibroblasts was, therefore, probably direct. However, increases in DNA content of sponges could not be fully accounted for by increased DNA synthesis, which suggests that recruitment may be {{an important component of the}} in vivo response. Taken together, the effects of CDGF on cultured cells and granulation tissue suggest that the sustained presence of CDGF in vivo may greatly enhance its effects upon wound repair...|$|R
40|$|Capillary {{proliferation}} {{induced by}} tumor {{is shown to}} be inhibited by neonatal <b>scapular</b> <b>cartilage.</b> Using the rabbit cornea as an assay, the cartilage implant decreased the rate of capillary growth, induced by tumor, {{by an average of}} 75 %. Vascularization was prevented completely in 28 % of tumors. The inhibitory effect of small cartilage implants operates over distances of up to 2. 0 mm and displays a gradient from the cartilage source. The experiments suggest that the cartilage inhibitor does not antagonize tumor angiogenesis factor, but appears to inhibit capillary proliferation directly. The inhibitory material does not elicit an inflammatory response in either the rabbit cornea or in the chick chorioallantoic membrane. Thus with further purification, it may prove useful as a means of maintining tumor dormancy by "antiangiogenesis. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{triiodothyronine}} (T 3) on mammalian growth-plate cartilage in vitro. Growth-plate cartilages from fetal pigs scapulae were incubated for 3 to 7 d in serum-free medium alone or medium containing T 3. Alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of hypertrophied chondrocytes, was increased in T 3 (10 nM) -treated growth-plate cartilage 152 +/- 36 % above that of cartilage incubated in medium alone after 3 d of incubation, and 324 +/- 47 % after 7 d of incubation. There was a dose-response increase in alkaline phosphatase activity to T 3 over the range of 0. 01 - 10 nM. The rise in alkaline phosphatase activity was specific for T 3 since growth-plate cartilage alkaline phosphatase activity was not increased by cortisol, insulin, parathyroid hormone, or 5 % fetal calf serum. Histological studies of growth-plate cartilage showed that T 3 in a concentration-dependent manner increased {{the width of the}} zone of maturation (hypertrophied chondrocytes). Histochemical staining for alkaline phosphatase activity demonstrated that T 3 caused the recruitment of new cells into the zone of maturation. T 3 also stimulated incorporation of L-[3 H]leucine into protein and 35 SO 4 into proteoglycan in growth-plate cartilage. In contrast, T 3 did not increase alkaline phosphatase activity or radiolabeled precursor incorporation into nongrowth-plate <b>scapular</b> <b>cartilage.</b> These studies demonstrate that T 3 directly stimulates maturation and, to a lesser degree, growth-related processes in fetal mammalian growth-plate cartilage...|$|E
