5|$|In 1722, René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur {{demonstrated}} that iron {{was transformed into}} <b>steel</b> <b>through</b> the absorption of some substance, now known to be carbon. In 1772, Antoine Lavoisier showed that diamonds are a form of carbon; when he burned samples of charcoal and diamond and found that neither produced any water and that both released {{the same amount of}} carbon dioxide per gram.|$|E
5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon <b>steel,</b> <b>through</b> which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E

25|$|At {{the west}} end of Liberty Road, the highway from Frederick to Libertytown was paved in macadam by 1921. This highway was {{originally}} marked as MD 31 when the Maryland State Roads Commission first numbered state highways in 1927. The portion of MD 31 west of Libertytown became an extension of MD 26 by 1933. The gap between Eldersburg and Libertytown was gradually constructed as a concrete road. The highway was constructed from Eldersburg to Dorsey Crossroads, the site of the modern MD 97 junction, by 1923. MD 26 was extended through Winfield in 1924 and 1925. The concrete road was extended to just east of Taylorsville in 1928, the same year a new section of the highway was paved through Unionville. The road to Taylorsville was completed and the Unionville concrete road was extended east in 1930. The final sections of MD 26 between Baltimore and Frederick were completed in 1933, the same year a <b>steel</b> <b>through</b> truss bridge was constructed over the Monocacy River to replace the vulnerable old bridge at Ceresville.|$|E
25|$|MD 214 intersects Queen Anne Bridge Road, {{which leads}} to the {{abandoned}} Queen Anne Bridge and the historic home Hazelwood, just west of its <b>steel</b> <b>through</b> truss bridge across the Patuxent River at the Prince George'sAnne Arundel county line. The highway meets the southern end of MD 424 (Davidsonville Road) in the Davidsonville Historic District. MD 214 intersects Riva Road and passes the historic home Summer Hill on its way to Edgewater. The highway gains a second lane westbound at Pike Ridge Road, which is unsigned MD 214A. The route gains a second eastbound lane and a median just west of its intersection with MD 2 (Solomons Island Road). MD 214 veers southeast and becomes undivided at Stepneys Lane and meets the southern end of MD 253 (Mayo Road) opposite South River High School, then drops to two lanes ahead of its intersection with MD 468 (Muddy Creek Road). MD 214 continues east through the community of Selby-on-the-Bay, where it passes the entrance to Camp Letts and the historic home Gresham. The highway passes through Mayo and its name changes to Beverley Avenue on the northern edge of Beverley Beach. MD 214 curves east onto Grande View Avenue and reaches its eastern terminus at a gate just east of Oakford Avenue.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{portion of}} MD 214 in Anne Arundel County was built along Pike Ridge Road {{and the modern}} {{alignment}} as a gravel road named Davidsonville Road from Solomons Island Road (now MD 2) to Riva Road by 1921. This highway was extended west to Davidsonville in 1924 and 1925. Davidsonville Road was originally designated MD 254. The portion of MD 214 from MD 253 in Edgewater to Beverley Beach was constructed as part of MD 253. This highway was built as a [...] gravel road from the modern MD 214MD 253 intersection east to the entrance to Camp Letts by 1923. MD 253 was extended southeast to Selby-on-the-Bay in 1929 and 1930. The state highway reached MD 214's present terminus in Beverley Beach in 1932. MD 214 and MD 254 were connected {{with the construction of}} a gravel highway along mostly new alignment between MD 3 and MD 424 in 1934 and 1935. The project included the present <b>steel</b> <b>through</b> truss bridge across the Patuxent River. MD 214 was extended east along MD 254's course to MD 2 by 1939.|$|E

The near-surface microstructures obtained by annealing were compared with microstructures obtained by bulk processing, to evaluate their potential corrosion and stress corrosion resistance...|$|R
