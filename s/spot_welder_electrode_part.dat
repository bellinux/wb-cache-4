When considering such weld joints, the heat imbalances are very interesting factors on spot welding research and therefore I have simulated the dissimilar weld joints using Ansys 14. Initially, it was simulated and later those results are compared with real welded samples. The common welded regions such as: fusion zones, heat affected zones, heat extended zones and base metals are all well-noticed for carbon steel sides but not for stainless steel sides. Besides, the electrode mushrooming effect on both sides of electrodes are not parallel deterioration and it has some demerits on internal structure indeed.

50|$|In the 1930s, the {{invention}} of the <b>spot</b> <b>welder</b> by Watkin allowed a much greater success rate when soldering fine wires, especially, steel. Elliot's of Liverpool produced the welder commercially and promoted it in the instruction manual: ‘The Watkin welder has been designed by an eminent orthodontist essentially for the speedy and efficient welding of stainless steel wire and tape. Weighing only 35lbs, it is completely portable. The Watkin Welder has proved invaluable to other professions, and is used extensively in the engineering, electrical and allied trades.’The Watkin Welder sold widely and it was used by the valve maker Mullard and by leading orthodontists, clinicians and hospitals throughout the world for twenty-five years until an electronic <b>spot</b> <b>welder</b> superseded it. Watkin did become wealthy through its sales but as he did not believe in patents he did not make the great fortune he perhaps deserved.

50|$|The basic <b>spot</b> <b>welder</b> {{consists}} of a power supply, an energy storage unit (e.g., a capacitor bank), a switch, a welding transformer, and the welding electrodes. The energy storage element allows the welder to deliver high instantaneous power levels. If the power demands are not high, then the energy storage element isn't needed. The switch causes the stored energy to be dumped into the welding transformer. The welding transformer steps down the voltage and steps up the current. An important feature of the transformer is it reduces the current level that the switch must handle. The welding <b>electrodes</b> are <b>part</b> of the transformer's secondary circuit. There is also a control box that manages the switch and may monitor the welding electrode voltage or current.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSpot welding {{adhesives}} {{were largely}} used in vehicle bodywork construction. Currently, spot welding adhesives process or {{also known as}} weld bonding process was the effective solution for improving mechanical properties of metal joining. However, it also created issues in occupational safety and health. Previous study confirmed notably higher airborne contaminants were detected prior to usage of welding adhesive. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the personal welding fumes exposure and pulmonary function of welders involved in the weld bonding process. Welding fumes analysis revealed out of 15 investigated elements, none were exceeding the threshold limits for both spot and weld bonding processes. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) were conducted by using hand held spirometer to 15 control group, 11 <b>spot</b> <b>welders</b> and 19 weld bonding welders. Result of the study shows a significant mean difference of pulmonary functions values in investigated welder groups. Weld bonding welders had the lowest mean pulmonary functions values compare to other groups. Statistical analysis reveals that the pulmonary function of <b>spot</b> <b>welders</b> were affected significantly by number of smoking years but not significantly affected to duration of exposure. However, weld bonding welders pulmonary functions values were not significantly affected neither by smoking years nor working durations. It is suggested for future works to include the airborne contaminant monitoring of toxic gases for further understanding of weld bonding process on safety and health effects towards welders...|$|R

40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a {{solid state}} welding method and is common for {{aluminum}} alloys. There have been many studies to apply this process for high melting materials such as steels and titanium.
