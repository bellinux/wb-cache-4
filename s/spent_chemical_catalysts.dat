50|$|In Europe, Chematur Engineering AB of Sweden commercialized the SCWO {{technology}} {{for treatment of}} <b>spent</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>catalysts</b> to recover the precious metal, the AquaCat process. The unit has been built for Johnson Matthey in the UK. It is the only commercial SCWO unit in Europe and with its capacity of 3000l/h {{it is the largest}} SCWO unit in the world. Chematur's Super Critical Fluids technology was acquired by SCFI Group (Cork, Ireland) who are actively commercializing the Aqua Critox SCWO process for treatment of sludge, e.g. de-inking sludge and sewage sludge. Many long duration trials on these applications have been made and thanks to the high destruction efficiency of 99.9%+ the solid residue after the SCWO process is well suited for recycling - in the case of de-inking sludge as paper filler {{and in the case of}} sewage sludge as phosphorus and coagulant.SCFI Group operate a 250l/h Aqua Critox demonstration plant in Cork, Ireland.|$|E
40|$|<b>Spent</b> <b>catalysts,</b> <b>chemical</b> {{traps and}} sorbents are types of solid wastes {{generated}} worldwide, which contain potentially valuable or environmentally hazardous materials {{that need to}} be recovered before final deposition. Chlorination and electrolysis are unit processes applied in extractive metallurgy for metal extraction from poly-metallic or low-grade ores. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} assess the possibility of applying pyrometallurgy (chlorination) and electrometallurgy to <b>spent</b> <b>chemical</b> sorbents used as sulfur traps and to recover zinc. The spent sorbents may include zinc in different phases: ZnO, ZnS and Zn 0. 65 Al 0. 35 (OH) 2 (CO 3) 0. 167 (H 2 O) 0. 5. It was found that 96. 8 % of the zinc can be separated by dry chlorination at 475 ºC with pure chlorine. Before chlorination, addition of CaCO 3 (17 wt. %) is necessary to prevent formation of ZnSO 4. The zinc chloride obtained is dissolved in water and electrolyzed to generate chlorine which can be recycled to the chlorination reactor, and metallic zinc as a non-adherent layer on the cathode. The electrolyte composition is 65 g. L− 1 ZnCl 2 with 20 g. L− 1 H 3 BO 3 and 200 g. L− 1 KCl. It is possible to recover pure zinc (99. 9 wt. %) from chemical sorbents with the methodology proposed. These results are important for the development of new and more efficient recovery strategies to prevent environmental damage and obtain valuable elements from wastes...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of different curing lights and <b>chemical</b> <b>catalysts</b> on the degree of conversion of resin luting cements. A total of 60 disk-shaped specimens of RelyX ARC or Panavia F of diameter 5 mm and thickness 0. 5 mm were prepared and the respective <b>chemical</b> <b>catalyst</b> (Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Plus or ED Primer) was added. The specimens were light-cured using different curing units (an argon ion laser, an LED or a quartz-tungsten-halogen light) through shade A 2 composite disks of diameter 10 mm and thickness 2 mm. After 24 h of dry storage at 37 A degrees C, the degree of conversion of the resin luting cements was measured by Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy. For statistical analysis, ANOVA and the Tukey test were used, with p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0. 05. Panavia F when used without catalyst and cured using the LED or the argon ion laser showed degree of conversion values significantly lower than RelyX ARC, with and without catalyst, and cured with any of the light sources. Therefore, the degree of conversion of Panavia F with ED Primer cured with the quartz-tungsten-halogen light was significantly different from that of RelyX ARC regardless of the use of the <b>chemical</b> <b>catalyst</b> and light curing source. In conclusion, RelyX ARC can be cured satisfactorily with the argon ion laser, LED or quartz-tungsten-halogen light with or without a <b>chemical</b> <b>catalyst.</b> To obtain a satisfactory degree of conversion, Panavia F luting cement should be used with ED Primer and cured with halogen light.
