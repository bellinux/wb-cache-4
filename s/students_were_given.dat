25|$|The Federal {{government}} {{provides a}} block grant to universities based on student enrolment but unrelated to performance {{and lacking in}} accountability. When university education was first introduced, <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> free room and board but, since 2003, there has been cost sharing whereby the student pays full cost for room and board and a minimum of 15% of tuition fees. The government provides a loan which must be repaid, starting one year after completing the degree. Certain programs are chosen for exemption whereby students can re-pay in kind. In the case of secondary school teacher training, students can serve as teachers for a specific number of years.|$|E
25|$|Defenders of Peronism also {{describe}} the doctrine as populist, albeit {{in the sense}} that they believe it embodies the interests of the masses, and in particular the most vulnerable social strata. Admirers hold Perón in esteem for his administration's anti-imperialism, and non-alignment, as well as its socially progressive initiatives. Amongst other measures introduced by Perón's governments, social security was made universal, while education was made free to all who qualified, and working <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> one paid week before every major examination. Vast low-income housing projects were created, and paid vacations became standard. All workers (including white-collar employees) were guaranteed free medical care and half of their vacation-trip expenses, and mothers-to-be received three paid months off prior to and after giving birth. Workers' recreation centers were also constructed throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|In the {{war years}} of 1917–1919, the break between the United States and Germany struck a {{military}} tone on campus. Individual students were volunteering in the Marines, in the Canadian Forces, {{and other forms of}} service. As America entered World War I the U.S. War Department inaugurated the Students' Army Training Corps, a program designed to use existing colleges and universities as training facilities for new military personnel. On the morning of October 1, 1918, about 150,000 college boys on US campuses transformed into student soldiers. This was the induction into the Students' Army Training Corps. In Delaware, on campus, approximately 400 <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> the oath of allegiance. The men received the regular army training and academic instruction prescribed by the Committee on Education and Special Training of the War Department. The mode of student activities changed: campus traditions were put aside, and athletic events were cancelled throughout the fall semester of 1918.|$|E

The boys and girls lived separately, things made available for example dining hall, laundry, bakery and classrooms.

25|$|In July 1959 La Salle Green Hills (then spelled La Salle – Green Hills) {{opened its}} door to two preschool-level {{sections}} and one section each for elementary school units one and two.

On August 24, 1960, La Salle Green Hills, Inc. was registered as non-stock, non-profit corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In August 1964, the high school was established. In 1968, when the De La Salle High School – Manila was made defunct, graduates of the De La Salle Grade School were transferred to the La Salle Green Hills High School, making La Salle Green Hills the high school of De La Salle University – Manila, until {{the establishment of the}} co-educational De La Salle-Santiago Zobel School in 1978. The De La Salle Grade School – Manila was made defunct in 1983, after which male <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> an option to study either at LSGH (for northern and central Metro Manila residents) or at DLSZ (for southern Metro Manila residents).|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} school trained cadets {{for various}} periods, 3 years {{for those who}} were not proficient in French, 2 years {{for those who were}} proficient in French and one year for Non-Commissioned Officer’s. At the end of the training period, they graduate and get promoted to lieutenant rank according to a degree. During the graduation ceremony which is often chaired by the Syrian prime minister, the graduating officers are given Platoon commander certificate each in his own specialty (Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Engineering) and a certificate of competence for the rank of lieutenant. After the graduation, the officers are assigned to different army units where they establish the necessary departments and units in order to train, habilitate and lead.

Instructors and students joined the Kobbeh barracks in Tripoli and they were put administratively under the authority of the third battalion’s company located there. After that, <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> a 15 days leave and joined a camp in Kousba.

500|$|Allan Bakke {{applied to}} UC Davis medical school again in 1974. He was interviewed twice: once {{by a student}} interviewer, who {{recommended}} his admission, and once by Dr. Lowrey, who in his report stated that Bakke [...] "had very definite opinions which were based more on his personal viewpoints than on {{a study of the}} whole problem… He was very unsympathetic to the concept of recruiting minority students." [...] Lowrey gave Bakke a poor evaluation, the only part of his application on which {{he did not have a}} high score. He was rejected again, although minorities were admitted in both years with significantly lower academic scores through the special program. Not all minority applicants whose admission was recommended under the program gained entry—some were rejected by the admissions committee. [...] This, however, did not affect the number of minority students to be admitted, sixteen. Although 272 white people between 1971 and 1974 had applied under this program, none had been successful; in 1974 the special admissions committee summarily rejected all white students who asked for admission under the program. Only one black student and six Latinos were admitted under the regular admissions program in that time period, though significant numbers of Asian <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> entry.|$|E
