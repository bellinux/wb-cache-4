60|$|The faint, rank {{smell of}} the wild beasts {{mingling}} with the evening air, was instilling its intoxication in my brain. I longed for darkness, the din and glare; longed for my tent and the gaping faces, for the smoky wind to fan my cheek as I bobbed cantering round the ring. It must have been <b>a</b> ridiculously childish <b>face</b> that ever and again scrutinized my companion's. Nothing for me in that looking-glass! How <b>slow</b> <b>a</b> <b>face</b> his was; he was refusing to look at me. It dismayed and fretted me to find him so sombre and dour.|$|R

"Mirror Woozle" [...] - These distinctively French woozles {{supposedly}} {{spend all}} day admiring themselves in their mirrors, {{and are able to}} <b>slow</b> down <b>a</b> scary <b>face</b> process by using their mirrors to flip the screen and therefore making it more confusing to complete the grimace code. The Mirror Woozle appears in Eeyore's Dream and Rabbit's Dream. They also appear in the Final Level.|$|R
50|$|Two weeks later, in the 1-mile Preakness Stakes, Seattle <b>Slew</b> <b>faced</b> <b>a</b> new {{rival in}} multiple-stakes-winner Cormorant. Many handicappers {{believed}} the predicted speed duel with Cormorant would jeopardize the Derby winner's chances; Andrew Beyer picked Cormorant {{to win in}} his Washington Post column. Seattle Slew outstayed Cormorant, holding off Iron Constitution to win by 1 lengths.|$|R
50|$|On the September 16 {{episode of}} WWE Superstars, before a match with MVP, Gallows cut a promo {{announcing that he}} was no longer part of the Society by proclaiming he was his own man. Gallows went on to lose the match. On the September 21 taping of SmackDown, Gallows began <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>face</b> turn when he confronted CM Punk in a {{backstage}} segment stating that after defeating him, he would have a beer, but lost a match to Punk later in the night.|$|R
5|$|Manganism is a biphasic disorder. In {{its early}} stages, an {{intoxicated}} person may experience depression, mood swings, compulsive behaviors, and psychosis. Early neurological symptoms {{give way to}} late-stage manganism, which resembles Parkinson's disease. Symptoms include weakness, monotone and <b>slowed</b> speech, <b>an</b> expressionless <b>face,</b> tremor, forward-leaning gait, inability to walk backwards without falling, rigidity, and general problems with dexterity, gait and balance. Unlike Parkinson's disease, manganism is not associated with loss of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with L-DOPA. Symptoms of late-stage manganism become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels return to normal.|$|R
50|$|Leaving the car, {{they walk}} along a path, where they see panes of <b>slow</b> glass <b>facing</b> <b>a</b> {{view of a}} loch. They meet Mr Hagan, who {{is sitting on a}} low wall in front of his stone {{farmhouse}} and looking towards the house. Inside, through the window, they see a young woman, presumably Mrs Hagan, and a small boy. Hagan fetches a rug from the house so that Selina can sit on a wall. The narrator, sensing that Mrs Hagan, looking towards them from inside, is not aware of them, wonders if she is blind; Selina remarks that her dress is out of fashion.|$|R
40|$|In a 21 -year-old {{woman with}} a smaller and sloppy handwriting, {{drooling}} especially when stooping, sporadic choking, clumsiness, and frequent stumbling, Wilson's disease was diagnosed. The medical history disclosed {{a short period of}} haemolytic anaemia with transient hepatic failure, and irregular menstruation periods with infertility. On examination there were no signs of liver or spleen enlargement. She was <b>slow,</b> had <b>an</b> expressionless <b>face</b> and mild dysarthria, and slight impairment of the coordination of the limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed bilateral hyperintensive lesions of the basal ganglia on T 2 W images. Zinc therapy induced a good biochemical response and there was also some clinical improvement. Linkage analysis within the family identified one other asymptomatic homozygotically affected sister. A diagnostic delay occurs frequently due to relative unfamiliarity with this rare disease and due to its variable clinical expressio...|$|R
25|$|The {{fans were}} irate and fist fights {{broke out in}} the crowd as El Hijo del Santo {{attacked}} Casas. The feud helped ease sagging business caused by the split with AAA and the downturn of the Mexican economy. The following week, the two trios had a rematch and both El Dandy and Negro Casas challenged Santo to a hair vs. mask match. The match was made a triangle match on December 6, 1996. Santo took El Dandy's hair in a bloody match in front of sold out crowd in Arena Mexico. The feud would continue until the 64th anniversary show on September 19, 1997 where Negro Casas and El Hijo del Santo <b>faced</b> off in <b>a</b> dramatic hair vs. mask match. El Hijo del Santo won the match and began <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>face</b> turn.|$|R
5000|$|While all of {{this was}} going on, Hogan formed an {{unlikely}} alliance with former enemy and top challenger to his WWF Championship, Randy [...] "Macho Man" [...] Savage. Savage had been an egomaniacal heel during most of his first two years in the WWF, but in the late summer of 1987 began <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>face</b> turn. The friendship, then, was formed when Hogan -- at the persuasion of Savage's valet, Miss Elizabeth -- saved Savage from a 3-on-1 attack by The Honky Tonk Man, and Hart Foundation members Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart. Although Hogan and Savage teamed together at untelevised house shows (usually against Honky and the Hart Foundation), nothing more was made of it on national television until shortly before WrestleMania IV, when Hogan rescued Savage from a brutal attack by Andre the Giant, DiBiase and Virgil.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} role of {{high-frequency}} trading in a dynamic limit order market. Being fast is valuable because it enables traders to revise outstanding limit orders upon news arrivals when interacting with slow market participants. On the one hand, the existence of fast traders can help to reduce the inefficiency that {{is rooted in the}} risk of being "picked off" after unfavourable price movements and therefore allows more gains from trade to be realized. On the other hand, <b>slow</b> traders <b>face</b> <b>a</b> relative loss in bargaining power which leads them to strategically submit limit orders with a lower execution probability, thereby reducing trade. Due to this negative externality, the equilibrium level of investment is always welfare-reducing. The model generates additional testable implications regarding the effects of high-frequency trading on order flow statistics. ...|$|R
2500|$|Later in 2003, Jericho began <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>face</b> turn, by {{starting}} a romance with Trish Stratus while his tag team partner Christian began one with Lita. This, however, {{turned out to}} be a bet over who could sleep with their respective paramour first, with a Canadian dollar at stake. Stratus overheard this and ended her relationship with Jericho, who seemingly felt bad for using Stratus. After he saved her from an attack by Kane, Stratus agreed that the two of them could just be [...] "friends", thus making Jericho <b>a</b> <b>face.</b> After Christian put Stratus in the Walls of Jericho while competing against her in a match, Jericho sought revenge on Christian, which led to a match at WrestleMania XX. Christian defeated Jericho after Stratus ran down and [...] "inadvertently" [...] struck Jericho (thinking it was Christian) and Christian got the roll-up. After the match, Stratus turned on Jericho and revealed that she and Christian were a couple. This revelation led to a handicap match at Backlash that Jericho won. Jericho won his record-breaking seventh Intercontinental Championship at that year's Unforgiven in a ladder match against Christian, breaking the previous record held by Jeff Jarrett from 1999. Jericho's seventh reign was short lived, as he lost it at Taboo Tuesday to Shelton Benjamin.|$|R
50|$|The Hart Foundation {{wrestled}} {{in another}} 20-man battle royal at WrestleMania IV, {{the ending of}} which saw Bret start <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>face</b> turn. Hart and Bad News Brown were the last 2 competitors in a 20-man Battle Royal and looked to be co-existing heels but Brown then attacked and eliminated Hart to win. Immediately after being declared the winner and being awarded a huge trophy, Hart attacked Brown and smashed up the trophy starting his face turn. Neidhart eventually joined Bret's side in the feud with Brown causing a rift between the team and manager Jimmy. This led them to fire him and turn <b>face,</b> before starting <b>a</b> feud with The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers. In the fall of 1988, Jimmy Hart began managing the Rougeaus, and got them a pay raise {{at the expense of}} a 25% cut to The Hart Foundation's. Further to the story, it was revealed that Hart had actually sold a portion of the Hart Foundation's contract to the Rougeaus.|$|R
5000|$|Robinson's {{career as}} a {{photographer}} was not however to continue past the early 1970s. In the late 1960s he began frequenting Andy Warhol's Factory in Manhattan and his lifestyle gradually shifted towards the excesses that were typical of the Factory scene of the era. In the early 1970s he developed a serious drinking problem and his professional career and financial stability began to unravel as a result. By the end of 1972 Robinson's once steady flow of work had <b>slowed</b> to <b>a</b> trickle. <b>Facing</b> financial problems he left New York and moved south to Memphis, Tennessee. His {{career as a}} professional photographer was over, {{and it was a}} part of his life that Robinson would seldom speak of in years to come. He became an intensely private person. For reasons not at all clear, he seemed determined to remain anonymous. He once confided in a friend that [...] "he wanted a coffee table book after he was dead, but he just didn't want any limelight while he was alive." ...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{the fall}} of 1987, Hogan and Savage were bitter enemies. In fact, from late 1985 through mid-summer 1987, the two often {{wrestled}} for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Hogan was able to defeat Savage on many of these occasions, although Savage gained some important countout and disqualification victories over Hogan as well. While Hogan {{was the most popular}} star in the WWF during most of this time, Savage—who was the WWF Intercontinental Champion for many of their matches in 1986 and early 1987—had gained a strong following even during his heel days, and by July 1987, was starting to get more cheers than boos. <b>A</b> <b>slow</b> <b>face</b> turn for Savage was beginning, and gained credibility when an angle was started involving The Honky Tonk Man (a heel who had since won the Intercontinental Championship) began making disparaging comments about Savage. (To also aid in Savage's face turn, the WWF began booking him against various heels, including King Kong Bundy and Killer Khan, with those matches taking place prior to his first match against Honky.) ...|$|R

In the following weeks, Hardy would debut a new persona as a [...] "Broken" [...] man with part of his hair bleached blonde along with a strange British-like accent, blaming Jeff (who he began to refer to as [...] "Brother Nero", Nero being Jeff's middle name) for breaking him and becoming obsessed with [...] "deleting" [...] him. On June 12, at Slammiversary, Matt was defeated by Jeff in a Full Metal Mayhem match. On the June 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, Matt was once again defeated by Jeff in a Six Sides of Steel match. On the June 28 episode of Impact Wrestling, Matt challenged Jeff to a final battle with the Hardy brand on the line, to take place at their home in Cameron, North Carolina the next week. On July 5, during special episode [...] "The Final Deletion", Matt defeated Jeff in the match to become sole owner of the Hardy brand, forcing Jeff to drop his last name and become referred to as [...] "Brother Nero". It was around this time that Matt's broken gimmick would become very popular due to his accent and over-the-top way of words, starting <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> <b>face</b> turn.|$|R
