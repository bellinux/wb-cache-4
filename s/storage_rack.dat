2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} losses from theft, the next innovation adopted by bike sharing programmes {{was the use of}} so-called 'smart technology'. One of the first 'smart bike' programmes was the Grippa™ bike <b>storage</b> <b>rack</b> system used in Portsmouth's Bikeabout scheme. The Bikeabout scheme was launched in October 1995 by the University of Portsmouth, UK as part of its Green Transport Plan in an effort to cut car travel by staff and students between campus sites. Funded in part by the EU's ENTRANCE programme, the Bikeabout scheme was a [...] "smart card" [...] fully automated system. For a small fee, users were issued 'smart cards' with magnetic stripes to be swiped through an electronic card reader at a covered 'bike store' kiosk, unlocking the bike from its <b>storage</b> <b>rack.</b> CCTV camera surveillance was installed at all bike stations in an effort to limit vandalism. Upon arriving at the destination station, the smart card was used to open a cycle rack and record the bike's safe return. A charge was automatically registered on the user's card if the bike was returned with damage or if the time exceeded the three-hour maximum. Implemented with an original budget of approximately £200,000, the Portsmouth Bikeabout scheme was never very successful in terms of rider usage, in part due to the limited number of bike kiosks and hours of operation. Seasonal weather restrictions and concerns over unjustified charges for bike damage also imposed barriers to usage. The Bikeabout program was discontinued by the University in 1998 in favour of expanded minibus service; the total costs of the Bikeabout programme were never disclosed.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{types of}} pallet <b>storage</b> <b>racks</b> are {{available}} with different designs to fulfill specific functions or create specific advantages. To create the ideal pallet racking system, several considerations {{should be taken into}} account: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of steel <b>storage</b> <b>racks,</b> {{which are often}} unbraced, may depend solely on the pallet beam to upright connector and on the stiffness of the base plate to floor connection. This paper presents experimental results from cyclic tests performed on portal beam to upright bolted moment connections intended for cold-formed steel drive-in and drive-through <b>storage</b> <b>racks.</b> In <b>storage</b> <b>racks,</b> portal beams are typically connected to uprights by "tab connectors", which are costly to manufacture and experience initial looseness. By simply bolting the portal beams to the uprights, bolted moment connections may represent a cost-effective alternative to "tab connectors". A literature review shows that bolted moment connections between cold-formed steel members are economical and feasible. However, experimental results show {{a significant amount of}} looseness in the connection after an initial high moment-rotational stiffness. Being slender structures, <b>storage</b> <b>racks</b> are sensitive to the second-order P-? effect, and international racking specifications require the initial looseness of the tab connectors to be considered when analysing the {{stability of}} the rack in the down-aisle direction (sway motion). The non-linear cyclic behaviour of bolted moment connections is presented and explained herein. Based on finite element results, it is shown that, for drive-in and drive-through racks, the looseness in bolted moment connections can be ignored in ultimate limit states design. Finally, the paper concludes with proposing two methods, with different degree of complexity, for the design of drive-in and drive-through racks with bolted portal beam to upright bolted moment connections.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the behaviour of selective steel <b>storage</b> <b>racking</b> {{systems in the}} cross-aisle direction. Steel <b>storage</b> <b>racks</b> are regular kind of equipment; these systems are developed for enhancing the storage of load units in diverse weights and sizes. In most cases in this study, the boundary conditions assumed fixed on their fundamental state, to prevent from any possible moment – rotation and uplift effects on uprights. Finite element method (FEM) modeling was used to analyze and evaluate the natural frequency of diagonally k-braced frame at cross-aisle direction. This report takes advantage of capabilities of two well-known structural analysis software for FEM modeling: Abaqus and Strand 7. The objective is to predict and determine the eigenvalues and natural frequencies of selective steel <b>storage</b> <b>racks</b> in the cross-aisle direction. Taking the fact into account that {{the reaction of the}} structure under seismic loads is vitally important at this critical direction, this paper will provide a better view for designing these type of structures in the future.
