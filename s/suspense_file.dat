50|$|The Social Security Administration {{has stated}} that it {{believes}} unauthorized work by non-citizens is {{a major cause of}} wage items being posted as erroneous wage reports instead of on an individual's earnings record. When Social Security numbers are already in use; names do not match the numbers or the numbers are fake, or the person of record is too old, young, dead etc., the earnings reported to the Social Security Agency are put in an Earnings <b>Suspense</b> <b>file</b> ESF. The Social Security spends about $100 million a year and corrects all but about 2% of these. From tax years 1937 through 2003 the ESF had accumulated about 255 million mismatched wage reports, representing $520 billion in wages and about $75 billion in employment taxes paid into the over $1.5 trillion in the Social Security Trust funds. As of October 2005, approximately 8.8 million wage reports, representing $57.8 billion in wages remained unresolved in the <b>suspense</b> <b>file</b> for tax year 2003.|$|E
50|$|The {{most recent}} attempt {{to pass a}} {{severance}} tax occurred in 2013, which was authored by now State Senator Noreen Evans, was Senate Bill 241, which would have imposed a 9.5% severance tax for oil and a 3.5% severance tax for natural gas. If it had passed, the revenues would have been directed to funding state parks, higher education and the general fund. Senate Bill 241 is currently on the <b>suspense</b> <b>file</b> in the Senate Appropriations Committee. During the same year, Jack Tibbetts, an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, authored and put forward a proposed ballot initiative titled as the California Modernization and Economic Development Act. Like Senate Bill 241, this initiative would have taxed oil and gas extraction at 9.5% and directed funds to higher education state parks, {{as well as provide}} subsidies to businesses to fund localized renewable energy projects. The measure earned the endorsements of many prominent figures including former US Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and Nobel laureate Dr. Daniel Kammen. The proponent of initiative later joined forces with Senator Evans and both switched their focus from gathering signatures to mobilizing students to support Senate Bill 241. Further recent developments for a severance tax in California include the support of asset manager Tom Steyer. Leading up to 2014, Steyer launched an effort to conduct public education and issue awareness, as well as lobby California legislators for the implementation of a severance tax. A poll conducted by Steyer's nonprofit organization, NextGen Climate, found that 64% of 800 likely California voters for the 2016 election support the tax.|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Inaccurate social security numbers (SSN) on wage statements contribute to growth in the Social Security Administration's (SSA) Earnings <b>Suspense</b> <b>File,</b> increase the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) workload to ensure that wages are properly identified for those earning them, and burden individuals who must work with SSA and IRS to resolve disputes that may affect their social security benefits and tax obligations. IRS's ability to penalize employers for submitting inaccurate SSNs on wage statements is intended to promote SSN accuracy. Items GAO was asked to describe included: (1) the statutory provisions authorizing IRS to penalize employers who file wage statements with inaccurate SSNs; (2) IRS's program to penalize such employers; and (3) the extent IRS's program meets legislative requirements, the likelihood of any penalties, and any program changes being considered. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} Bachelor thesis was {{to compare}} meat breed cattle efficiency. For the {{comparison}} were chosen these breeds: Aberdeen Angus and Highland. Data about the breeds were finding on Branišov ecofarm and on Bořanovice ecofarm {{in the area of}} Šumava national park. Highland cattle breed - Scottish national cattle was imported to Czech Republic in 1991 from Scotland to mountain conditions of NP Šumava to Branišov farm. This breed is ranked among extensive meat breed of small constitutional type, it is also called ?hobby breed?. Aberdeen angus breed is ranked among most widespread meat breed in the world. It originates from North-East Scotland, where the meat performance cattle type was bred in early 18 th century. Later it was crossbred with shorthorn breed. Aberdeen Angus is a breed of genetically hornless minor to medium body frame. At breeds the growth was valued by detection their live weight at birth, at the age of 120, 210 and 365 days. From detected data of <b>suspense</b> <b>files</b> basic statistic characteristics were evaluated (percent occurrence, arithmetic mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation). The average weight of HI breed calves at birth was 25 kg at bullocks and 20 kg at heifers. In 365 days the average weight of bullocks reached 301 kg and 264 kg at heifers. The average weight of AA breed calves at birth was 37 kg (bullocks) and 34 kg (heifers). In 365 days the average weight of bullocks reached 485 kg and 365 kg at heifers. Further there were ranking of reproductive indices and maternal qualities of cows. From observed results was evaluated father influence, birth sequence and calve month sequence depending on calves? weight. Father influence on calves? growth at AA breed wasn?t statistically significant. The highest live weight in 120, 210 and 365 days had AA calves at third calving. At HI breed was influence of calving sequence on claves live weight statistically insignificant. The highest live weight (120, 210 days) had the calves born in august at AA breed (175, 64 kg or 275, 27 kg) and at HI breed (at the age of 210 days 183, 33 kg). In term of economics is this stock raising without grants unprofitable. With grants the gain on VDJ amounts 6876 CZK at AA breed and 10 186 CZK at HI breed. The results proved, that for provision of profitable stock raising BTMP would the Aberdeen Angus heifers be calved at first at the age of 24 months, it has to be assured good fertility of cows, high additions of calves and also high longevity of cows...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Each year, the Social Security Administration (SSA) receives millions of employer-submitted earnings reports (Form W- 2 s) that it is unable to place in an individual Social Security record. If the Social Security number (SSN) and name on a W- 2 do not match SSA's records, the W- 2 is retained in the Earnings <b>Suspense</b> <b>File</b> (ESF). SSA's ability to match earnings reports is essential to calculating Social Security benefits. Because of concerns {{about the size of}} the ESF, GAO was asked to determine (1) how SSA processes workers' earnings reports, (2) the types of errors in ESF reports and the characteristics of employers whose reports are in the ESF, (3) how often earnings from repeatedly used SSNs have been reinstated and who receives the earnings from theses reports, and (4) what key factors contribute to ESF postings. ...|$|E
