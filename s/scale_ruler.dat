Here we show that the acyl chain length (ACL) of phosphatidylserine (PS) is correlated with plant lifespan. Among the detected eight head-group classes of membrane lipids with lipidomics based on triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry, the ACL of PS showed high diversity, {{in contrast to the}} ACLs of the other seven classes, which were highly conserved over all stages of development in all plant species and organs and under all conditions that we studied. Further investigation found that acyl chains of PS lengthened during development, senescence, and under environmental stresses and that increasing length was accelerated by promoted- senescence. The acyl chains of PS were limited to a certain carbon number and ceased to increase in length when plants were close to death. These findings suggest that the ACL of PS can count plant lifespan and could be a molecular <b>scale</b> <b>ruler</b> for measuring plant development and senescence...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} the utility and reliability of footprint dimensions in age, sex and stature determination in the North Indian population. Materials and Methods: This study was carried out using a sample of 400 people (146 female and 254 male) aged 10 - 65 years in Uttar Pradesh, North Western state of India. Footprints of both feet were taken bilaterally, and thus a total of 800 prints were obtained. A cluster of 7 measurements were taken carefully {{with the help of}} a scientific <b>scale</b> <b>ruler.</b> Five measurements were length dimensions from the most anterior part of the toe (T 1 –T 5) to the mid rear heel point and two were breadth dimensions from both left and right footprints: breadth at ball (BBAL), breadth at heel (BHEL) and 2 indexes: heel-ball Index (HBI) and footprint index (FPI). All data were analyzed statistically using Student’s t-test, regression coefficient and Pearson’s correlation for the estimation of sex on the basis of footprint dimensions. Results: The T 1 in left footprints was greater than right footprints in males, while T 1 and BBAL were both found to be greater in left footprints than right footprints in females. All the seven foot dimensions were higher in males than females.

Regarding less complications of intravenous acetaminophen, we aimed to compare it with intravenous morphine in management of renal colic pain. Materials and Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial was applied with a convenience sampling method, as 124 patients suffering from renal colic pain were randomly assigned into two groups of 62 patients. Pain was assessed using visual analog <b>scale</b> <b>ruler.</b> Results were analyzed by SPSS. 18 using the descriptive statistic, Chi-square, ANOVA, independent t-test and logistic regression. Results: According to the findings, 84 subjects (67. 7 %) were male. The mean age of participants were 39. 06 (11. 58). The mean of pain scores were not significantly different between two groups before administration of drugs (P = 0. 415), while the more pain relief was achieved in morphine group after the intervention. Sex and age as influencing factors did not develop a significant difference in both groups. About the adverse effects, morphine had more complications and both groups showed a significant difference in occurrence of dizziness (P = 0. 000) and hypotension (P = 0. 014). Conclusion: Comparing intravenous morphine and acetaminophen in renal colic pain reviled that morphine can develop greater pain relief, but more complications such as dizziness and hypotension. Acetaminophen can be also be effective in renal colic pain, so it is concluded that acetaminophen can be administered as a less harmful drug for patients with renal colic pain...|$|E

This project is based on the concepts of reverse engineering where in which the wheel loader is designed and analyzed to precision. Initially the dimensions of the wheel loader are documented by using vernier caliper and full <b>scale</b> <b>ruler.</b> These dimensions are vitally implemented in generating the 3 D model of the wheel loader. SolidWorks has been used for 3 D model creation. In order to run the design to real time standards a few design modifications are taken into account. Design of lift arm cylinders, lift arms, tilt/bucket cylinder and connecting rod are modified to real time standards. Kinematics of wheel loader has been analyzed in SolidWorks. For kinetics and structural analysis the model has been exported from SolidWorks to MSC Visual Nastran Desktop 4 D. In order to analyze the structural dynamics, the method of finite element analysis is used.

However {{in many cases the}} data is time sensitive and the data in the system needs to change dynamically in accordance with time and developing such systems requires considerable effort. Google Maps has in many ways revolutionized and simplified GIS and made it available to the masses, however powerful the service may be, it lacks a simple method to enable users to create and publish geospatial data on their maps and more so when it comes to creating dynamic time sensitive data.

40|$|Changes in {{extracellular}} {{peroxidase activity}} may be mediated by phytochrome {{as a means}} of regulating grown rate changes. This was tested in the first internode of light grown mustard seedlings. A correlation between an extracellular anionic peroxidase isoform (A 4), extracted by infiltration/centrifugation, was found to decrease in activity by 50 % when growth rate was enhanced by a low R:FR ratio. The preparation of protoplasts revealed A 4 to be more or less exclusively extracellular. The phytochrome-regulation of A 4, apparent in the small percentage of the enzyme that could be extracted by infiltration/centrifugation, was not repeated when the major pool of A 4 was examined. A light regulated increase in peroxidase activity was however found in mustard hypocotyls. The light-regulation of cucumber hypocotyl growth was tested and changes in a ionically bound (IB) cationic peroxidase fraction examined. More specifically the use of a long hypocotyl, phytochrome B deficient cucumber mutant (lh), enabled further speculation as to the phytochrome species involved in these changes. When examined, the IB peroxidase activity increased in activity within two hours of the addition of supplementary FR light (a low R:FR ratio), correlating with a change in the rate of growth that could be detected using a mm <b>scale</b> <b>ruler.</b> Whether changes in extracellular peroxidase activity constitute a primary mechanism in the phytochrome-mediation of growth rate changes in light-grown cucumber hypocotyls remained indeterminable. Speculations and possible importance of the observed correlations are discussed. In etiolated cucumber seedlings phytochrome has been shown to control growth within minutes of exposure to light. The extracellular peroxidase activity however, remained unaltered until two days after the commencement of de-etiolation. Thus it was postulated that there appears to be two separate mechanisms in cucumber hypocotyls by which phytochrome-mediated growth rate changes and associated changes in cell wall extensibility are regulated...|$|E

Methods: Twenty-seven children, aged 8 to 12 years, took part in the experiment, {{with a mean age of}} 10. 2 years, divided into 2 groups: the laser group (n= 14), in which rapid maxillary expansion was performed in conjunction with laser use, and the no-laser group (n= 13), with rapid maxillary expansion only. The activation protocol of the expansion screw was 1 full turn on the first day and a half turn daily until achieving overcorrection. The laser type used was a laser diode (TWIN Laser; MMOptics, Sao Carlos, Brazil), according to the following protocol: 780 nm wavelength, 40 mW power, and 10 J/cm(2) density at 10 points located around the midpalatal suture. The application stages were 1 (days 1 - 5 of activation), 2 (at screw locking, on 3 consecutive days), 3, 4, and 5 (7, 14, and 21 days after stage 2). Occlusal radiographs of the maxilla were taken with the aid of an aluminum <b>scale</b> <b>ruler</b> as a densitometry reference at different times: T 1 (initial), T 2 (day of locking), T 3 (3 - 5 days after T 2), T 4 (30 days after T 3), and T 5 (60 days after T 4). The radiographs were digitized and submitted to imaging software (Image Tool; UTHSCSA, San Antonio, Tex) to measure the optic density of the previously selected areas. To perform the statistical test, analysis of covariance was used, with the time for the evaluated stage as the covariable. In all tests, a significance level of 5 % (P< 0. 05) was adopted. Results: From the evaluation of bone density, the results showed that the laser improved the opening of the midpalatal suture and accelerated the bone regeneration process. Conclusions: The low-level laser, associated with rapid maxillary expansion, provided efficient opening of the midpalatal suture and influenced the bone regeneration process of the suture, accelerating healing.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 51 sets of patient radiographs were studied, where digital and standard radiographic techniques had been used for each patient. Key bony landmarks were measured, the <b>scaled</b> <b>ruler</b> analysed and the femur templated to gauge the most appropriate implant size of implant. RESULTS: Introduction of digital techniques {{has resulted in a}} mean magnification of 97 %, whereas most manufacturers' templates assume a magnification of 115 - 120 %.

This study compared the accuracy of mesiodistal measurements of bone using panoramic radiography, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), and the clinical methods. Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, panoramic and CBCT images were obtained from 100 implant patients. Mesiodistal bone dimensions (distance between tooth CEJ in the mesial of edentulous region and CEJ of the tooth in distal of edentulous region) were calculated using a <b>scaled</b> <b>ruler</b> on the orthopantomograms and the system software in the CBCT images. During the implant insertions, a mucoperiosteal flap was raised and clinical dimensions {{of the bone}} were measured by a periodontal probe and bone gauge. The differences of bone height and thickness measurements between gold standard and CBCT or panoramic modalities were analyzed using Student’s t- test. Results: The mean bone height was 10. 64 ± 1. 55, 11. 44 ± 1. 51, and 10. 68 ± 1. 6 mm in the clinical, panoramic and CBCT modalities, respectively. Statistically significant difference was noted between the clinical and panoramic techniques (P 0. 05). During the bone height calculations, 79 %, 62 % and 78 % of the images were ranked in the normal range using CBCT, panoramic and gold standard measurements, respectively. The mean areas under the ROC curve were 0. 92 and 0. 83 in CBCT and panoramic techniques, respectively.
