5|$|The Cabildo {{accepted}} the document {{and moved to}} the balcony to submit it directly to the people for ratification. But, because of the late hour and the weather, {{the number of people in}} the plaza had declined. Leiva ridiculed the claim of the remaining representatives to <b>speak</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the people. This wore the patience of the few who were still in the plaza in the rain. Beruti did not accept any further delays, and threatened to call people to arms. Facing the prospect of further violence, the popular request was read aloud and immediately ratified by those present.|$|E
5|$|So {{long as we}} exclude one community, {{we cannot}} as a {{political}} <b>speak</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> or claim to represent {{all the people of}} our presidency. If, as we hope, provincial autonomy is given to the provinces {{as a result of the}} reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation should be in a position to claim to be a truly representative body of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It may be that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on the ground that it is an exclusive organisation.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} with {{a speech at}} Bowling Green on August26, 1899. He answered many allegations {{that had been made}} about him, including claims that he had secretly been seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination all along, that he had ambitions of succeeding Senator William Joseph Deboe, and that following the nominating convention, he had agreed to <b>speak</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the Goebel ticket. Brown conceded that he desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and that he had agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination if it had been offered to him, but he denied that he had ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party again, just as he had in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.|$|E

5|$|Dow {{was later}} elected to two {{terms in the}} Maine House of Representatives, but retired after a {{financial}} scandal. He joined the Union Army shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} American Civil War in 1861, eventually attaining the rank of brigadier general. He was wounded at the siege of Port Hudson and later captured. After being exchanged for another officer in 1864, Dow resigned from the military and devoted himself once more to prohibition. He spoke across the United States, Canada, and Great Britain in support of the cause. In 1880, Dow headed the Prohibition Party ticket for President of the United States. After losing the election, he continued to write and <b>speak</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the prohibition movement {{for the rest of his}} life until his death in Portland at the age of 93.|$|E
25|$|Churchill {{responded by}} sending Cripps to India {{on a mission}} ("the Cripps Mission") to {{negotiate}} {{an agreement with the}} nationalist leaders Gandhi, claiming to <b>speak</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> all Indians and Jinnah claiming to <b>speak</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the Muslims, that would keep India loyal to the British war effort in exchange for self-government after the war, notionally promised by the Government of India Act, 1935. Cripps designed the specific proposals himself, but they were too radical for Churchill and the Viceroy, and too conservative for the Indians, and no middle way was found.|$|E

A second Arab Orthodox conference was held in Jaffa on 28 October 1931.|$|E
25|$|In 1808, {{after the}} French {{invasion}} of Spain, the Criollos {{and some of}} the Spanish living in New Spain wanted to proclaim the independence of the colony and establish a governing junta, similar to the anti-French juntas in the mother country. On September 1, 1808, Talamantes delivered two tracts to the Ayuntamiento, in favor of separation from Spain and of the convoking of a Mexican congress. His premises were that all ties to Spain had now been broken; that regional laws had to be made, independently of the mother country; that the Audiencia could not <b>speak</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the king; and that the king having disappeared, sovereignty was now vested in the people.|$|E
25|$|Besides jurists {{there was}} a second {{community}} of Muslim ulema, the scholars and ascetics. Foremost among these ābid was Buhlul b. Rashid (d. 799), who reputedly despised money and refused the post of grand judge; his fame accordingly spread throughout the Islamic world. By virtue of their piety and independence, the ābid won social prestige and a voice in politics; some scholars would <b>speak</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the governed cities, criticizing the regime's finance and trade decisions. Although substantially different, the status of the ābid relates somewhat to the much later, largely Berber figure of the Maghribi saint, the wali, who as keeper of baraka (spiritual charisma) became the object of veneration by religious believers, and whose tomb would be the destination of pilgrimage.|$|E

25|$|A stake {{disciplinary}} {{council is}} convened by the stake president in instances where {{it appears that}} a holder of the Melchizedek priesthood has committed an offence which may result in excommunication or when the subject {{is a member of}} a bishop's immediate family. In such instances, the council is composed of the stake president, his two counselors, and the twelve members of the stake high council. After hearing the evidence in the case and the submissions of the high councilors—one half of whom <b>speak</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the accused—the stake president and his counselors are encouraged to make a joint unanimous decision on the outcome. However, the stake president has the final say and can theoretically make a decision over the protest of either or both of his counselors.|$|E
25|$|The {{rise of the}} CIO in the mid-1930s {{represented}} a threat to Hague's policy of guaranteeing labor peace to the sweatshop type industries that might otherwise have fled Jersey City's high property taxes. When Socialist presidential candidate Norman Thomas came to <b>speak</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the CIO during a May Day rally in Journal Square, Hague's police swept Thomas and his wife into a car, {{took them to the}} Pavonia ferry and sent them back to New York. Hague spent much of the decade inveighing against Communists and labor unions, and his attempts to suppress the CIO's activities in Jersey City led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision, Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization 307 U.S. 496 (1939), that is a cornerstone of law concerning public expression of political views on public property.|$|E
25|$|Launching {{a four-month}} public consultation, Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Stephen Lam, said all current {{permanent}} and deputy secretaries would continue with their duties such as studying, justifying and designing government policies, while the newly appointed deputy directors would assist bureau chiefs in liaising with legislators and provide political input in policy formulation and implementation; the assistants to bureau directors would line up suitable appointments to help bureau chiefs {{reach out to}} the community. Lam further argued that Hong Kong's political team of 14 Policy Secretaries was too thin compared with Canada and the United Kingdom, for example, where two or three layers of ministers <b>speak</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> the government. The changes would strengthen governance and preserve the civil-service system. The proposal appeared to coincide with the ideas contained in a study by the Bauhinia Foundation to increase civic engagement launched in early July 2007.|$|E

500|$|Expertsincluding Helle Lykke Nielsenwho have {{examined}} the dossier {{said that it was}} broadly accurate from a technical point of view but contained a few falsehoods and could easily have misled people not familiar with Danish society, an assessment which the imams have since agreed to. Some mistakes were that Islam is not officially recognised as a religion in Denmark (it is), that the cartoons are the result of a contest, and that Anders Fogh Rasmussen in his role as Prime Minister gave a medal to Ayaan Hirsi Ali (he gave one in his capacity as party leader of the Liberal Party). The imams also claimed to <b>speak</b> <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> <b>of</b> 28 organisations, many of which later denied any connection to them. Additions such as the [...] "pig" [...] photograph may have polarised the situation (the association of a person and a pig is considered very insulting in Islamic culture), as they were confused for the cartoons published in the newspaper. Muslims who met with the group later said Akkari's delegation had given them the impression that Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen somehow controlled or owned Jyllands-Posten.|$|E
