The causes can be classified into three categories: macroeconomic causes, regulatory or supervisory shortcomings and causes related to incentives or corporate control.

After an overview of their magnitude, we consider the institutional arrangements under which many of the sovereign wealth funds operate. We focus on {{a specific set of}} agency problems that is of first-order importance for these funds: that is, the direct involvement of political leaders in the management process. We show that sovereign wealth funds with greater involvement of political leaders in fund management are associated with investment strategies that seem to favor <b>short-term</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> goals in their respective countries at the expense of longer-term maximization of returns. Sovereign wealth funds face several other issues, like how best to cope with demands for transparency, which can allow others to copy their investment strategies, and how to address the problems that arise with sheer size, like the difficulties of scaling up investment strategies that only work with a smaller value of assets under investment. In the conclusion, we discuss how various approaches cultivated by effective institutional investors worldwide [...] from investing in the best people to pioneering new asset classes to compartmentalizing investment activities [...] may provide clues as to how sovereign wealth funds might address these issues.

30|$|Earlier studies often {{noted that}} {{individuals}} with previous experience of welfare had {{an increased risk of}} future participation, perhaps because the experience (in itself) alters the cost or stigma related to receiving assistance, shifting the individual preference structures and increasing the likelihood of remaining on welfare for a longer period. If this is true, efforts should be made to avoid <b>short-term</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> that increase the likelihood of people’s being exposed to this experience. Alternatively, the observed persistence might be due to innate individual differences, with some individuals having a greater propensity to live on welfare than others. If these differences among people are not properly controlled for when analyzing the patterns of welfare participation, then observed persistence will not necessarily be related to changes in individual preferences.|$|R
30|$|Two {{potential}} {{explanations for}} this kind of behavior have been emphasized in the literature (Heckman 1981 a and 1981 c). One explanation is that the experience in itself alters the cost or the stigma related to welfare participation, shifting the structure of the individual’s preferences and increasing the propensity of remaining on welfare in the following period. This kind of persistence {{is often referred to as}} a “true” or structural state dependence. If this type of persistence is strong in the population, efforts should be made to avoid <b>short-term</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> that increase people’s likelihood of being exposed to this experience. An alternative explanation is that the observed persistence is a result of innate individual differences which comes from permanent unobserved heterogeneity across individuals. This implies that some individuals have a larger propensity to live on welfare relative to others. If this is the case, it means that current participation has no structural effect on the future propensity to participate and is referred to as “spurious” state dependence.|$|R

An introduction of the scrapping in Germany highly interferes to functioning of the market because of its strong car industry. The thesis {{is going to}} focus on an impact of scrapping in several areas such as an effect on the Gross domestic product, the car industry, the employment in the car industry and the financial development of the car factories Volkswagen and BMW. The crucial part of the thesis is the practical part which is going to work with an available data about the economics in the Federal Republic of Germany in years 2008 and 2009 (partially 2010) from the research of German Statistical office, appropriate ministry and further professional studies. The theoretical part of the thesis {{is going to be}} based on effectiveness of the state policy and the influence of long-term and <b>short-term</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Policy</b> on economical situation. The thesis is going to marginally include an effect of lobbyism in politics which leads to an establishment of supportive moves in specific branches of industry at the expense of other branches. The purpose of my thesis is to try to determine if the introduction of scrapping is as a whole positive or negative event for society...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} topics in recent economic literature concerns the determinants of the real exchange rate. In spite of the lack of theoretical consensus on how to determine the real exchange rate, empirical literature has shown that exchange rate overvaluation has negative effects on long-term economic growth. This paper theoretically discusses and empirically analyses these determining factors of the real exchange rate in Brazil in the 2000 s. The Brazilian economy has shown a tendency of real overvaluation of its currency since high inflation was controlled in the mid- 1990 s. This tendency has only been interrupted by occasional internal or external shocks. Our empirical study is {{a modified version of the}} econometric model proposed by Razin and Collins (1999). Like these authors, our theoretical and empirical models break down the determining factors of the actual real exchange rate into long-term and short-term factors. However, while Razin and Collins (1999) assume that deviations of the real exchange rate from its long-term trend are caused by short-term shocks, we assume that they are influenced by the direct and indirect impacts of <b>short-term</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy.</b> Most of the our econometric results concerned with estimating the real exchange rate in Brazil in the 1999 - 2010 period corresponded to those expected, according to the theoretical literature. Even taking into account that our econometric estimation is based on monthly data, the results showed that for more than 55 % of the period the Brazilian real exchange rate was overvalued. The empirical evidence also showed that Brazil’s risk premium, the stock of international reserves and the lagged differential between Brazilian and foreign short-term interest rates reveal the most significant level, explaining the real overvaluation of the Brazilia...|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} the non-accelerating {{inflation}} rate of unemployment (NAIRU) for policy questions is keeping on gaining its importance {{in the last two}} decades. Setting an <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> requires, among others, an identification of the sustainable rate of capacity utilization. In this sense susceptibility is normally associated with reasonably stable inflation. Thus, in terms of labour market the idea of sustainable resources utilization is closely connected to the concept of potential employment and the NAIRU which provides a benchmark to identify sustainable and unsustainable trends in unemployment and output. <b>Short-term</b> employment-stimulating <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> alone can not permanently effect equilibrium unemployment: the NAIRU may, to some degree, be influenced by the path of actual employment, but its shifts are mainly determined by structural factors. Temporary supply shocks may alter the rate of inflation, while the NAIRU will be basically unaffected once they are outdone; by contrast, long-term supply shocks (caused, for example, by demographic changes) may permanently modify the NAIRU path. Despite the prominence of the NAIRU concept, its empirical implementation often provides controversial results since the variable itself is unobservable and not always well defined. As a result, alternative methodologies for measuring the NAIRU can lead to important divergences in their estimates. Country administrations and international economic authorities, however, find it useful to use NAIRU estimates as an input to various assessments of fiscal and structural policies. Model specification and choice of estimation method become an important issue in that given context. In this paper I present a review of alternative theoretical approaches broadly classified into three groups: statistical, structural and combined methods. Conceptual basis of different assessments and their ability to provide precise estimates are analyzed with respect to the usefulness for <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> analysis. Since the conventional wisdom and officially adopted approach of the leading international economic organizations for estimating the NAIRU relies on the existence of an expectations-augmented Phillips-type relationship, I suggest to model potential labour output using two structural equations: wage setting equation in the form of expectation augmented Phillips curve and an employment equation allowing for supply shocks as proxied by labour force participation rate. The NAIRU is estimated from the modified Phillips curve equation ("triangle" Phillips model) using the Kalman filter. keywords: non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, potential labor supply.
