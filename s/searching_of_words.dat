40|$|Self-indexing is {{a concept}} {{developed}} for indexing arbitrary strings. It has been enormously successful {{to reduce the size}} of the large indexes typically used on strings, namely suffix trees and arrays. Selfindexes represent a string in a space close to its compressed size and provide indexed searching on it. On natural language, a compressed inverted index over the compressed text already provides a reasonable alternative, in space and time, for indexed <b>searching</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> and phrases. In this paper we explore the possibility of regarding natural language text as a string of words and applying a self-index to it. There are several challenges involved, such as dealing with a very large alphabet and detaching searchable content from non-searchable presentation aspects in the text. As a result, we show that the self-index requires space very close to that of the best word-based compressors, and that it obtains better search time than inverted indexes (using the same overall space) when searching for phrases...|$|E

Machine translation includes natural language understanding and generation.

In machine translation the <b>searching</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> from the lexicon is a compulsory task, here this searching stage is utilized efficiently by proposing an intelligent integer based lexicon system, consists of a number of separate lexicons and an algorithm is also developed for searching words from the lexicon in order to accomplish the basic steps of machine translation...|$|R

40|$|There {{is a large}} {{collection}} of Handwritten English paper documents of Historical and Scientific importance. But paper documents are not recognized directly by computer. Hence the closest way of indexing these documents is by storing their document digital image. Hence a large database of document images can replace the paper documents.

This paper applies the technique <b>of</b> <b>word</b> spotting using Modified Character Shape Code to Handwritten English document images for quick and efficient query <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> on a database of document images.

40|$|An {{intervention}} {{aimed at}} maintaining positive prisoner-family relationships responds to needs of warranty and support {{so that the}} imprisonment of a parent doesn’t deprive the child a normal relation life. Clinical practice shows {{that the majority of}} inmates experienced in their childhood the imprisonment of a parent or emotional distance from him/her. This deprivation could lead to development, in adulthood, of a difficulty in recognizing authority, social conventions and an inability to tolerate frustrations. Research shows that: 30 % of the children of inmates are destined to repeat the detention path of the imprisoned parent; families with experience of detention are exposed to a high risk of exclusion; the children are more exposed to abandonment and deviance; long incarcerations undermine the relationship of the couple. Intervention in this direction also pursues pro-social purposes: Bahr shows how a strong bond with their family reduces the risk of recidivism. With this project, we operate in different directions: on under-age children to support their relationship with the imprisoned parent in a perspective of empowerment; support for relationship of the couple, helping the family to manage the forced separation between child and imprisoned parent, supporting the relationship with the child and accompanying him/her in <b>search</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> that allow him/her to represent the parent beyond the crime committed...|$|R
