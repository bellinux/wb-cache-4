When it {{eventually}} stops, Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) <b>steps</b> <b>out.</b> Marco is a Hollywood actor who, despite his recent rise to fame, does not feel much meaning in his daily life. He resides at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles from where he completes various publicity obligations for his new film: he is photographed with his co-star (Michelle Monaghan), gives interviews to the press, and attends an award ceremony in Italy. Despite drinking and socializing occasionally with Sammy (Chris Pontius), a fellow actor and childhood friend, Marco spends much time alone, driving his Ferrari motorcar, drinking beer, taking pills, and having casual sex with various women. Twice he has pole-dancing twins (Kristina and Karissa Shannon) set up their equipment and perform in his room, the first time he falls asleep and the second routine is more calisthenic than erotic.|$|E

50|$|There was {{anticipation}} that <b>Stepping</b> <b>Out</b> would re-establish Minnelli's film career. Originally <b>Stepping</b> <b>Out</b> was to {{be released}} in the spring of 1991 to coincide with her New York concert stage show Live from Radio City Music Hall, but because of a corporate restructuring at Paramount Pictures, the film's opening was delayed until the fall of 1991. Nonetheless, <b>Stepping</b> <b>Out</b> received quite a bit of publicity with Minnelli being interviewed on both Donahue and The Joan Rivers Show as well as appearing with the cast of <b>Stepping</b> <b>Out</b> (minus Ellen Greene and Julie Walters) on the The Sally Jessy Raphael Show to promote the film. When it was released on October 4, 1991, <b>Stepping</b> <b>Out</b> garnered decent reviews but only grossed $246,000 total in the United States and then went straight to video.|$|R

5|$|Perfect Dark Zero is a first-person shooter where players {{control the}} player {{character}} mostly from a first-person perspective. The combat features mechanics {{such as an}} evasive dodge roll and a cover {{system in which the}} gameplay switches to a third-person perspective, allowing the player to strategically aim without taking damage and be more aware of the surroundings. Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles {{as long as they can}} reasonably reach them. It is also possible to climb ladders. By doing so, the camera shifts into a third-person perspective. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. The health can recharge a bit if the player <b>steps</b> <b>out</b> of the line of fire for a few seconds, but it may not necessarily refill completely depending on how much damage the player took.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a new class}} of relaxed {{sequencing}} games is introduced: the class of <b>Step</b> <b>out</b> - <b>Step</b> in sequencing games. In this relaxation any player within a coalition is allowed to <b>step</b> <b>out</b> from his position in the processing order and to step in at any position later in the processing order. Providing an upper bound on the values of the coalitions we show that every <b>Step</b> <b>out</b> - <b>Step</b> in sequencing game has a non-empty core. This upper bound is a sufficient condition for a sequencing game to have a non-empty core. Moreover, this paper provides a polynomial time algorithm to determine the coalitional values of <b>Step</b> <b>out</b> - <b>Step</b> in sequencing games...|$|R

5|$|In {{the next}} match against Oxford University, Loxton {{came in at}} 4/206 and {{anchored}} the innings, remaining unbeaten on 79 as Australia were bowled out for 431. He featured in partnerships with Colin McCool and Doug Ring, who both made fifties. He then took the new ball in both innings, taking 1/14 and 1/16 from five and eight overs respectively in another innings victory. When Oxford batted, Philip Whitcombe struck a delivery from Ernie Toshack to Loxton, and took a few <b>steps</b> <b>out</b> of his crease. Loxton prepared to throw at the Whitcombe's stumps in a run out attempt, but did not release, while Whitcombe stood his ground outside the crease. In those days, the fielding standards were lower, with weaker and less accurate throws and Whitcombe was only a metre or two outside his crease, while Loxton was around thirty away. The next delivery from Toshack was again hit to Loxton, and Whitcombe again wandered outside his crease. This time Loxton threw the ball and hit the stumps directly, running out the batsman, who was unable to comprehend {{what had happened and}} shook his head.|$|E
