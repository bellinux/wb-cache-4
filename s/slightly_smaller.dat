40|$|Photonic crystal {{slab line}} defect waveguides with <b>slightly</b> <b>small</b> {{innermost}} holes are theoretically expected to show light transmission with low-group-velocity and low-dispersion (LVLD) characteristics owing to a linear and almost flat photonic band. In this study, the LVLD characteristics of such waveguides were experimentally confirmed by using modulation phase shift measurement and transmission of ultrashort optical pulses. These {{results will be}} applicable to buffering and nonlinearity enhancement of optical signals...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the relationship between spalling behaviour and spalling ratio of UFC with three kinds of short fibers (jute, polypropylene, water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol) at high temperature. The heating temperatures were 400 [*]°C and 600 [*]°C. Although the specimen with jute fiber dosage of 0. 19 % by volume was occurred explosive spalling, the damage of specimen was <b>slightly</b> <b>small.</b> It appears that the addition of jute fiber to UFC is effective for preventing spalling...|$|R

5|$|Initial {{estimates}} concerning Kepler-9c's mass were refined by follow-up observations {{made by the}} Keck 1 Telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory at Mauna Kea, Hawaii.

5|$|Kepler-9c is a gas giant that {{is smaller}} and {{slightly}} less massive than planet Saturn. It is approximately 0.171 MJ, or 17% {{the mass of}} planet Jupiter.

50|$|Undervirilization {{can occur}} if a genetic male cannot produce enough {{androgen}} or the body tissues cannot respond to it. Extreme undervirilization occurs when no significant androgen hormones {{can be produced}} or the body is completely insensitive to androgens. Both result in a female body. Partial undervirilization produces ambiguous genitalia part-way between male and female. The mildest degree of undervirilization may be a <b>slightly</b> <b>small</b> penis. Examples of undervirilization are androgen insensitivity syndrome, 5 alpha reductase deficiency, and some forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.|$|R

Yet, these molars show no sign of wear ( [...] the points on the crowns of the teeth are still sharp, and show little sign of abrasion by rough food matter), indicating that this individual died soon after the eruption of these molars.

5|$|Throughout Justinian's reign, {{the cities}} and villages of the East prospered, {{although}} Antioch was struck by two earthquakes (526, 528) and sacked and evacuated by the Persians (540). Justinian had the city rebuilt, but on a <b>slightly</b> <b>smaller</b> scale.|$|E
5|$|Variety frustosus is morphologically {{similar to}} the main type, but its cap becomes areolate (marked out into small areas by cracks and crevices) in maturity. Its spores are <b>slightly</b> <b>smaller</b> too, {{measuring}} 11–15 by 4–5.5µm. In the European form ereticulatus, the reticulations on the upper stipe are replaced with fine reddish granules, while the variety ruforubraporus has pinkish-red pores.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} a wafer-level batch fabrication technique of NdFeB film for MEMS (Micro Electromechanical Systems) based electromagnetic type energy harvester. By using 20 μm thickness NdFeB sputtered magnetic film on a trench-etched Si microstructure, fine patterned magnet structures for energy harvester had been realized. However {{the size of}} the sputtered sample was limited to the <b>slightly</b> <b>small</b> size. In this study, we improve the sputtering equipment to apply the NdFeB film process on a four-inch Si wafer. The film characteristics, estimation of the compatibility with the MEMS process and also energy harvesting result are presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} an inverted type bulk-heterojunction {{organic solar cell}} with 1 cm 2 active area using a fluorine-doped tin oxide/electrodeposited amorphous (TiOx) or anatase (TiO 2) titanium oxide electrode instead of the low work-functional electrode such as Al. The cell with TiO 2 showed the power conversion efficiency (η) of 2. 5 % by irradiating AM 1. 5 - 100 mW cm- 2 simulated sunlight.

5|$|Assuming less {{load and}} rolling friction, Raepsaet, in contrast, calculates a maximum pulling force of 27kN, {{which would have}} needed a <b>slightly</b> <b>smaller</b> towing crew. Under these circumstances, the use of {{harnessed}} oxen—which has been refuted by Tolley {{on the basis of}} their relatively diminished pulling capabilities— would have become feasible. However, the necessary expenditure of energy at the Diolkos must be regarded in both scenarios as considerable.|$|E
5|$|Boron carbide and cubic {{boron nitride}} powders {{are widely used}} as abrasives. Boron nitride is a {{material}} isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN {{is used as a}} high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name borazon, is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only <b>slightly</b> <b>smaller</b> than, but its chemical stability is superior, to that of diamond. Heterodiamond (also called BCN) is another diamond-like boron compound.|$|E
5|$|Europa (Jupiter II), {{the second}} of the four Galilean moons, is the second closest to Jupiter and the {{smallest}} at 3121.6 kilometers in diameter, which is <b>slightly</b> <b>smaller</b> than the Moon.
