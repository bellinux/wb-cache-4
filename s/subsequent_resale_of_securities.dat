This issues paper was prepared to facilitate further discussion. I. Current international standards for the treatment of the issue Balance of Payments Manual, 5 th Edition (BPM 5) 1 Merchanting is defined as the purchase of a good by a resident (of the compiling economy) from a nonresident and the <b>subsequent</b> <b>resale</b> <b>of</b> the good to another nonresident; during the process, the good does not enter or leave the compiling economy. The difference between the value of goods when acquired and the value when sold is recorded as the value of merchanting services provided (para 262). If the commodities are not resold by the merchant in the same accounting period, an import of goods is recorded in the first period, and a negative import entry is recorded in the later period. In the case that a merchanting transaction straddles different recording periods, changes from one recording period to another in the stocks of goods located abroad and valued at acquisition cost constitute part of goods of the economy of the owner (para 213, 262). In either situation, any difference between the value of the goods when acquired and relinquished is entered as merchanting under other business services (para 213) ...|$|R
25|$|The Peruvian Constitution {{establishes}} {{equal protection}} for {{domestic and foreign}} investors who may enter into agreements with the Government and guarantees free access, possession, and disposal of foreign currency. Hydrocarbon Law No. 26844 of May 1997 eliminated the exclusive rights of the state-owned Petróleos del Perú S.A. to control the secondary recovery of crude oil, refining, and imports and <b>subsequent</b> <b>resale</b> <b>of</b> petroleum and byproducts. The Peruvian laws have attempted to ensure more-favorable minerals and crude {{oil and gas exploration}} and production contract terms for investors. Legal procedures to obtain mining rights were made easier by the enactment of complementary legislation Supreme Decree No. 018 of July 9, 1992. The Government relinquished exclusive control over exploration, mining, smelting, and refining of metals and fuel minerals. Individuals and private companies are allowed to hold mining permits in Peru. In the legal framework for investment and taxation, no distinction is made among domestic and foreign investors, corporations, joint ventures, and consortia formed in Peru or abroad. Municipalities and Regional governments in areas where mineral resources (metals and industrial minerals) are exploited will receive 50% of the taxes collected to be invested in education and social programs (health, housing, and others) in conformance with the Canon Minero (Ministry Resolution No. 266-2002-EF/15 of May 1, 2002). The remittance of dividends, depreciation, and royalties abroad has no restrictions. Contracts can be signed by investors, and the Government guarantees the stability of legal commitments and taxes. To increase protection of investors’ interests, Peru signed agreements with the World Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency in April 1991, which was authorized by Legislative Decree No. 25312 and with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in December 2002, which was authorized by Legislative Decree No. 25809.|$|R
50|$|Shelf {{registration}} or shelf offering or shelf {{prospectus is a}} type {{of public}} offering where certain issuers are allowed to offer and sell securities to the public without a separate prospectus for each act of offering and without the issue of further prospectus. Instead, there is a single prospectus for multiple, undefined future offerings. The prospectus (often as part of a registration statement) may be used to offer securities for up to several years after its publication.A shelf registration statement is a filing with the SEC to register a public offering, usually where there is no present intention to immediately sell all the securities being registered. A shelf registration statement permits multiple offerings based on the same registration. A shelf registration can be used for sales <b>of</b> new <b>securities</b> by the issuer (“primary offerings”), <b>resales</b> <b>of</b> outstanding <b>securities</b> (“secondary offerings”) or a combination of both.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{are proposing}} {{significant}} revisions to Regulation AB and other rules regarding the offering process, disclosure and reporting for asset-backed securities. Our proposals would revise filing deadlines for ABS offerings to provide investors with {{more time to}} consider transaction-specific information, including information about the pool assets. Our proposals also would repeal the current credit ratings references in shelf eligibility criteria for asset-backed issuers and establish new shelf eligibility criteria that would include, among other things, a requirement that the sponsor retain a portion of each tranche <b>of</b> the <b>securities</b> that are sold and a requirement that the issuer undertake to file Exchange Act reports {{on an ongoing basis}} so long as its public securities are outstanding. We also are proposing to require that, with some exceptions, prospectuses for public offerings <b>of</b> asset-backed <b>securities</b> and ongoing Exchange Act reports contain specified asset-level information about each of the assets in the pool. The asset-level information would be provided according to proposed standards and in a tagged data format using eXtensible Markup Language (XML). In addition, we are proposing to require, along with the prospectus filing, the filing of a computer program of the contractual cash flow provisions expressed as downloadable source code in Python, a 1 commonly used open source interpretive programming language. We are proposing new information requirements for the safe harbors for exempt offerings and <b>resales</b> <b>of</b> assetbacked <b>securities</b> and are also proposing a number of other revisions to our rules applicable to asset-backed securities.
