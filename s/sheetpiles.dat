40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Large-scale {{experiments}} on circular model cell bulkheads {{were conducted to}} define the distribution of hoop stresses, deflections of the cells, distortion of the cell fill, ultimate overturning resistance, and the critical mode of failure. The embedment depth of the model cells was varied to investigate the effect of embedment {{on the behavior of}} circular cells. The model cells were subjected to typical service loading conditions, including backfilling and backfill surcharging and were failed by application of a large lateral load. Hoop tension during initial cell filling was found to be the critical design consideration for <b>sheetpiles</b> along the back of the cell. Maximum interlock tension occurred within the lower third of the exposed height of the <b>sheetpiles.</b> An apparent coefficient of lateral earth pressure ranging from 1. 2 to 1. 6 times the active Rankine value is recommended for design of isolated cells. Maximum hoop tension and radial bulging should be assumed to occur at an elevation of one-fourth of the distance from the point of sheetpile fixity {{to the top of the}} sheetpile. The depth to fixity may be estimated by theory of elasticity and depends on the quality of the soil in which the cells are embedded. Backfilling and surcharging increased hoop tension by about 25 and 10 percent, respectively. Crest deflections vary linearly with the magnitude of backfill surcharge. Distortion of the model cells at failure indicates that circular cell bulkheads fail as flexible structures. The critical mode of failure for embedded cells was found to be that of tilting about a point of fixity. A plastic hinge forms in the front <b>sheetpiles</b> at the point of fixity. Failure of the cell fill occurs along roughly vertical planes which extend vertically only to the point of tilting. It is shown that the method of analysis by vertical shear using the Rankine or Krynine coefficient significantly underestimates cell overturning resistance. The method of horizontal shear overestimates the overturning resistance for embedded cells by about 35 percent. An apparent coefficient of lateral earth pressure to be used with the proposed failure model is recommended. It is shown that this coefficient depends on sheetpile embedment and fill characteristics, and is significantly larger than previously suggested values. Available field data on circular cell bulkheads, specifically hoop tension and deflection data, is presented and discussed. In general, the trends in field data compare favorably with the results from the model study...|$|E

Vibrating wire strain gages {{were employed to}} measure horizontal strains in <b>sheetpiling</b> webs. These were converted to interlock force at eight locations and three elevations around the cell. The deformed shape of the cell was detected by using an inclinometer. Movements of the cell both vertically and horizontally were observed using surveying methods. In addition, {{the position of the}} phreatic line inside cell was noted. Difficulties with installation of instrumentation are described. Performance of the instruments successfully installed is discussed. The effect of each construction event is presented in the form of graphs which show the horizontal stress on <b>sheetpiling</b> surfaces, interlock forces and deformed shapes for <b>sheetpiling</b> and movements of the cell. Results of the study showed that the current method of analysis for this type of structure is adequate for calculation of maximum interlock forces. The coefficient of lateral earth pressure, K, to be used in interlock stability analysis, was shown to be about 0. 45 compared to a value of 0. 4 that was used in design. The settlement of the cell was greater than expected. The cell settled around ten inches {{by the end of the}} construction period. The observed settlements were attributed to wave action on <b>sheetpiling</b> and the weight of the cell fill and backfill, although no specific evidence separating their respective effects was available.

When used as breakwaters, the metal fatigue can become a possible mode of failure for cellular structures due to the cyclic unbalanced lateral loads imposed by the wave action;This study was initiated as {{an investigation of the}} cell failures of the Calumet Harbor Breakwater structure in the South Chicago Harbor. The primary objective was the assessment of the interlock force fluctuations in the <b>sheetpiles</b> induced by the wave action on the structure;It has been well established that the conventional design methods for cellular structures have substantial shortcomings. These methods are usually overconservative and incapable of predicting deformations. In the past 15 years finite element method has been applied to analyze the cellular structures. The method provides the means to deal with soil-structure interaction problem, loading and geometric irregularities, as well as behavioral complexities of the materials. Past finite element work consisted of two-dimensional model versions. Each of these models require certain assumptions and simplifications regarding loads and geometry and can provide only specific information. Three-dimensional modelling can eliminate these drawbacks at the cost of complex and tedious modelling work and considerable increases in computation time and memory requirements;The Calumet Harbor Breakwater structure was analyzed using two-dimensional vertical slide and three-dimensional finite element models in parallel to evaluate the performances on a comparative basis. The analysis consisted of three main sequential stages: (1) simulation of the construction, (2) simulation of the permanent cumulative wave load effects on the structural condition of the breakwater, (3) wave load analysis;The analysis results showed that the model predictions regarding the interlock forces, displacements and lateral pressures were consistent in the construction simulation stage. However, the differences became more predominant under the increased loading {{in the second and third}} stages. In the second stage, the analysis results confirmed that the permanent effects of the wave loads alter the structural state of the breakwater considerably. Regarding the wave load analysis, three-dimensional model predictions resulted in a better agreement with the field recorded data...|$|E
40|$|Movement of {{adjacent}} {{ground and}} support-of-excavation structures due to pile driving in non-plastic silts {{is a significant}} issue in urban areas of Rhode Island. There have been several cases in which such movements have damaged historic structures and transportation infrastructure. The objective {{of this research is}} to perform a finite element analysis of a particular case study involving movement of a sheetpile wall-supported excavation due to the excavation and pile driving activities. ^ The case study involved construction of a pile-supported gate and screening structure {{that is part of the}} combined sewer overflow project by the Narragansett Bay Commission. The structure was built by first driving <b>sheetpiles</b> around the site, then excavating in stages to the desired elevation, and then driving piles at the base of the excavation. Geotechnical instrumentation at the site included three inclinometers located behind the sheetpile walls and two piezometers in the excavation. Deformations of the wall were observed during each stage of excavation. Additional significant movements of the wall and elevated pore pressures were measured during pile driving. ^ A 2 -Dimensional finite element analyses was performed to model the deformation of the sheetpile walls using the commercial software PLAXIS version 7. Soils at the site were modeled with either a linear elastic, perfectly plastic Mohr-Coulomb constitutive model or a non-linear hyperbolic model. The excavation sequence was taken from construction records and simulated directly by removing soil in the model. Properties of the soils (strength and stiffness) were varied around values from the literature until the predicted wall movements matched observations. ^ There was good agreement between the modeled displacements and observations for the first two stages of excavation using reasonable values of strength and stiffness for Rhode Island silts. These parameters would be a good place to start in future modeling efforts involving support of excavation projects in Rhode Island. ^ The only way to simulate the last stages of excavation and wall displacement was to use unreasonably low values of strength and stiffness. Possible explanations for this poor agreement include: (a) loss of ground during pumping reduced the stability in the excavation and led to larger movements; (b) the excavation caused significant disturbance (almost liquefaction) of the soil at the base of the excavation; and (c) the soil surrounding the inclinometer tubes behind the wall moved or became disturbed and the measured movements are not representative of the actual wall movements. ^ Dynamic loading of the soil from pile driving could not be directly modeled within PLAXIS. Therefore, the effects of pile driving were modeled by reducing the strength and stiffness of the underlying silts to simulate disturbance and possible liquefaction. Again, the properties of the soil were reduced until the predicted movements match field observations. Although this ignores the fact that the actual process is at least partially undrained, the approach used in this thesis is a first step in understanding movement of adjacent structures in Rhode Island silts due to pile driving. ...|$|E

To enable prediction of ground vibration levels itis important to acknowledge the wave patterns induced in the ground to correctly determine whichattenuation model to adopt. This paper presents wave patterns in the ground due to vibratory <b>sheetpile</b> driving based on field measurements from three case studies. The results show different wavepatterns in the ground. At the ground surface the wave patterns are elliptical, resembling Rayleighwaves.
