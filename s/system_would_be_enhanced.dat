40|$|Rodent models {{highlight}} the key role of µ-opioid receptor (MOR) signaling in palatable food consumption. In humans however, {{the effects of}} MOR stimulation on eating and food liking remain unclear. In a bidirectional psychopharmacological cross-over study, 49 healthy men underwent a sweet taste paradigm following double-blind administration of the MOR agonist morphine, placebo, and the opioid antagonist nalt rexone. We hypothesized that behaviors regulated by the endogenous MOR <b>system</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enhanced</b> by MOR agonism, and decreased by antagonism. The strongest drug effects were expected for the sweetest (high-calorie) sucrose solution, as reported in rodents. However, very sweet sucrose-water solutions are considered sickly and aversive by many people (called sweet dislikers). Since both sweet likers and dislikers were tested, {{we were able to}} assess whether MOR manipulations affect pleasantness ratings differently depending on both subjective and objective value. As hypothesized, MOR stimulation with morphine increased pleasantness of the sweetest of five sucrose solutions, without enhancing pleasantness of the lower-sucrose solutions. For opioid antagonism, an opposite pattern was observed for the sweetest drink only. This bidirectional effect of agonist and antagonist treatment is consistent with rodent findings that MOR manipulations most strongly affect the highest-calorie foods. Importantly, the observed drug effects on pleasantness of the sweetest drink did not differ between sweet likers and dislikers. We speculate that the MOR system promotes survival in part by increasing concordance between the objective (caloric) and subjective (hedonic) value of food stimuli, so that feeding behaviour becomes more focused on the richest food available...|$|E
40|$|In minimal access surgery (MAS) (also {{known as}} {{minimally}} invasive surgery), operations {{are carried out}} by making small incisions in the skin and inserting special apparatus into potential body cavities through those incisions. Laparoscopic MAS procedures are conducted in the patient’s abdomen. The aim of MAS is faster recovery, shorter hospitalisation and fewer major post-operative complications; all resulting in lower societal cost with better patient acceptability. The technique is markedly dependent on supporting technologies for vision, instrumentation, energy delivery, anaesthesia, and monitoring. However, in practice, much MAS continues to take longer and be associated with an undesirable frequency of unwanted minor (or occasionally major) mishaps. Many of these difficulties result precisely from the complexity and mal-adaptation of the additional technology and from lack of familiarity with it. A survey of South East England surgeons showed the two main stress factors on surgeons to be the technical difficulty of the procedure and time pressures placed on the surgeon by third parties. Many of {{the problems associated with}} MAS operations are linked to the control and monitoring of the equipment. This paper describes work begun to explore ergonomic enhancements to laparoscopic operating technology that could result in faster and safer laparoscopic operations, less surgeon stress and reduce dependence on ancillary staff. Auditory displays have been used to communicate complex information to users in a modality that is complementary to the visual channel. This paper proposes the development of a control and feedback system that will make use of auditory displays to improve the amount of information that can be communicated to the surgeon and his assistant without overloading the visual channel.

30|$|It {{has been}} shown that the power {{allocation}} problem is very important for the lattice-based network coding [25, 26]. In [25], the feasibility of different powers for two sources has been studied, where two sources want to exchange messages with the help of only one relay. It is also disclosed that the <b>system</b> performances <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enhanced</b> if the sources use different transmit powers. However, there is no optimization of the power allocation for the sources. In [26], the power allocation is optimized for the underlying system in [25]; namely, the powers for the two sources are optimized by using an upper bound of the achievable rate. Unfortunately, the power for relay is fixed without any optimization. Thus, the joint power allocation schemes proposed in this paper can be used in the lattice-based network coding, where the power for the source lattice and that for the relay lattice are jointly optimized.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of successful cell-replacement therapies in the nervous <b>system</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enhanced</b> by {{an understanding of}} the basic biology of embryonic neural progenitor cells. The sympathoadrenal (SA) progenitor of the peripheral nervous system is among the best-characterized of such progenitors, in vertebrates. This cell, which derives from the neural crest, has a restricted developmental program that allows it to develop into a chromaffin cell or a sympathetic neuron, depending upon the environment to which it migrates. The extracellular signals that control the fate of SA progenitors have been identified, using both primary cultures of cells isolated from fetal rat adrenal glands and immortalized cell lines (MAH cells) derived from these primary progenitors. These studies have suggested that glucocorticoid hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex promote the {{development of}} SA progenitors into chromaffin cells, whereas fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) promote their development into sympathetic neurons. FGF and NGF appear to act sequentially; the former factor promotes neurite outgrowth and proliferation while the latter factor supports the survival of post-mitotic neurons. In addition to choosing between neuronal and endocrine fates, SA progenitors must also express an appropriate neurotransmitter phenotype. Although ordinarily noradrenergic, sympathetic neurons are able to convert to a cholinergic phenotype in response to specific inducing factors. This cholinergic potential is already present in uncommitted SA progenitors, as evidenced by their ability to synthesize acetylcholine. Recent studies suggest that these cells may have additional developmental capacities besides the chromaffin, noradrenergic and cholinergic sympathetic phenotypes, including the ability to generate serotonergic enteric neurons. The SA progenitor may therefore be a “master” neuroendocrine progenitor for the peripheral nervous system. Because it is multipotential, this progenitor (or immortalized lines derived from it) may be useful in heterologous cell transplantation therapies for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases...|$|E

The intended product lifetime (decades) far exceeds the product development cycle (months), preventing low-uncertainty predictions for this rapidly changing technology.

Moving toward more quantitative predictions requires consideration of many factors, including the intended application, consequence of a possible failure, variability in the manufacturing, installation, and operation, as well as uncertainty in the measured acceleration factors. As the industry matures, {{it is useful to}} periodically assess the overall strategy for standards development and prioritization of research to provide a technical basis both for the standards and the analysis related to application of those.

Traditional single coil solution is first designed {{according to the}} wok shape. The theoretical closed-form expressions of the eddy currents in the wok are derived, and further verified by finite-element method (FEM) analysis. The results reveal the localised and uneven eddy currents distribution for the induction cooker with an evenly distributed single coil. Variable turn pitch (VTP) coils are then proposed to address the eddy currents distribution problem. Corresponding analytical equations are given to present the design process of the VTP coils. The resulting eddy currents distribution on the wok is validated to be improved by applying the VTP coils. The inductance characteristics of the proposed VTP coils are also studied by conducting FEM and physical measurements. Finally, a prototype of the proposed system is developed and has undergone comprehensive experiments. The experimental results validate the theoretical analysis, indicating that the heating performance of the induction cooker <b>system</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> remarkably <b>enhanced</b> by implementing the VTP coils.

40|$|Stars in {{globular}} clusters are generally {{believed to have}} all formed at the same time, early in the Galaxy's history. 'Blue stragglers' are stars massive enough {{that they should have}} evolved into white dwarfs long ago. Two possible mechanisms have been proposed for their formation: mass transfer between binary companions and stellar mergers resulting from direct collisions between two stars. Recently, the binary explanation was claimed to be dominant. Here we report that there are two distinct parallel sequences of blue stragglers in M 30. This globular cluster is thought to have undergone 'core collapse', during which both the collision rate and the mass transfer activity in binary <b>systems</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>enhanced.</b> We suggest that the two observed sequences arise from the cluster core collapse, with the bluer population arising from direct stellar collisions and the redder one arising from the evolution of close binaries that are probably still experiencing an active phase of mass transfer.

To this end we previously generated a mouse whose olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) express DsRed driven by the S 100 ß promoter. We present here a transgenic reporter mouse whose olfactory sensory neurons express ZsGreen, driven by the olfactory marker protein (OMP) promoter. ZsGreen was very strongly expressed throughout the cytoplasm of olfactory sensory neurons labelling them in living cells and after fixation. Labelled sensory neurons were seen in all olfactory regions in the nose and fluorescent axons coursed through the lamina propria and into the main and accessory bulbs. We developed methods for culturing embryonic and postnatal olfactory sensory neurons using these mice to visualise living cells in vitro.

The system utilises a computer systems, using a camera to detect learner's emotion through facial expressions and gestures and other significant bio-signals. The system is able to adapt to students and displays emotion via a lifelike agent called Eve. Eve’s tutoring adaptations are guided by a case-based reasoning method for adapting to student states; this method uses data that was generated by an observational study of human tutors. This talk presents the observational study, the case-based method, the ATS itself and the implementation of its emotion detection technology on a computer system for real-time performance, and finally the implications of the findings for Human Computer Interaction in general and e-learning in particular.

40|$|Stand-alone {{photovoltaic}} {{lighting systems}} {{have been used to}} provide electricity in unelectrified remote locations in Tonga since 1987. PV lighting systems power many remote households and community halls and this improves lifestyles and upgrades living standards. Donors have spent millions of dollars to fund the purchase and installation of PV lighting systems in Tonga but this development is yet to prove its sustainability. This research examines the problems that influence the sustainability of PV lighting systems in Tonga and identifies problems related to their environmental, economic, technical and institutional sustainability. Proposals are put forward to enhance the future sustainability of Tongan PV lighting systems and related PV applications. The examination of sustainability employs the Brundtland definition of sustainability, viewing sustainability in terms of its environmental, economic, technical and institutional aspects. The research employs and analyses household surveys, data extracted from PV stakeholder interviews, and a literature search. The exploitation of fossil fuel and fuelwood resources is still significant in Tonga because the remote economy is a subsistence one, and environmental protection is not a priority. Lack of a proper recycling method for PV equipment increases the solid waste materials in the environment. Economically, users are reluctant to pay monthly fees, compounding problems with maintenance and access to spare parts. Social and cultural concerns have generally been ignored during system design and project planning. Technically, users experience poor system performance and some systems no longer operate. Institutionally, stakeholders have different perceptions and interests towards PV development in the islands. As a result, the By-Laws implemented to administer the PV lighting systems have never been enforced and stakeholders generally experience a low level of participation in governance, undermining their satisfaction with project implementation. The sustainability of PV <b>systems</b> in Tonga <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>enhanced</b> through the utilization of mature PV technologies under appropriate technological and institutional frameworks that reduce environmental problems and meet the socioeconomic needs of target communities...|$|R
40|$|The Wilderness lakes system {{represents}} a segmented barrier lagoon and comprises three interconnected lakes; Rondevlei, Langvlei and Eilandvlei. The latter is further linked by the Serpentine channel to the Touw river and Wilderness lagoon. The role of these channels, {{as well as}} a sluice in the Serpentine, in structuring certain aspects of the ecology of the system was investigated. An analysis of the salt budget of the lakes suggests that the Serpentine dampens tidaI processes {{to such an extent that}} they play only a minor role in the overall budget. Furthermore, the channel between Eilandvlei and Langvlei prevents any tidal salt input to the upper lakes. Their estuarine environments are however maintained by salt inputs which occur when the mouth is closed. This unusual phenemenon means that the sluice may have a minimal effect on the salt budget of the system because it is only closed when the mouth of the lagoon is open. Environmental conditions in each of the lakes, the Touw river and Wilderness lagoon were compared in terms of their physico-chemical characteristics and submerged macrophyte communities. A principal components analysis suggests that the physico-chemical environment of each lake is similar. The Touw river however has a very different environment, whilst that of Wilderness lagoon has some similarities to both the lakes and the river. During the study macrophyte communities recovered from a major recession which occurred between 1979 and 1981. Biomasses in excess of 1000 g m⁻² were recorded in both Langvlei and Eilandvlei. In the latter however, macrophyte growth was less prolific than in the former, as some areas of the littoral supported no growth at all. Macrophyte encroachment in the channels is a major factor inhibiting water flow between the lakes. This encroachment is most severe in the Eilandvlei/Langvlei channel where macrophytes covered 80 % of the channel's area. The dominant fish fauna throughout the system is composed of a marine/estuarine migratory component. In the lakes the Mugilidae and Sparidae are the most common families, whilst in the lagoon and Touw river predators such as Lichia amia and Argyrosomus hololepidotus also commonly occur. Eilandvlei serves as the initial nursery area for most migratory species. An estimated 52000 fish migrated up the Serpentine towards Eilandvlei during February 1984. Most fish do not penetrate as far as Langvlei, and this can be related to macrophyte encroachment in the Eilandvlei/Langvlei channel. However, it is argued that should this channel be dredged and the macrophytes removed, the nursery potential of the <b>system</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> greatly <b>enhanced.</b> This <b>is</b> because environmental heterogeneity, in association with an abundance of food in Eilandvlei, make this lake the most attractive nursery area to juvenile marine/estuarine fish...|$|R
