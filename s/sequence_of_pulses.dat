50|$|While analog {{transmission}} is {{the transfer of}} a continuously varying analog signal over an analog channel, digital communications is the transfer of discrete messages over a digital or an analog channel. The messages are either represented by a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulses</b> {{by means of a}} line code (baseband transmission), or by a limited set of continuously varying wave forms (passband transmission), using a digital modulation method. The passband modulation and corresponding demodulation (also known as detection) is carried out by modem equipment.

50|$|Code {{division}} multiplexing (CDM), Code division {{multiple access}} (CDMA) or spread spectrum is a class of techniques where several channels simultaneously share the same frequency spectrum, and this spectral bandwidth {{is much higher than}} the bit rate or symbol rate. One form is frequency hopping, another is direct sequence spread spectrum. In the latter case, each channel transmits its bits as a coded channel-specific <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulses</b> called chips. Number of chips per bit, or chips per symbol, is the spreading factor. This coded transmission typically is accomplished by transmitting a unique time-dependent series of short pulses, which are placed within chip times within the larger bit time. All channels, each with a different code, can be transmitted on the same fiber or radio channel or other medium, and asynchronously demultiplexed. Advantages over conventional techniques are that variable bandwidth is possible (just as in statistical multiplexing), that the wide bandwidth allows poor signal-to-noise ratio according to Shannon-Hartley theorem, and that multi-path propagation in wireless communication can be combated by rake receivers.|$|E

5000|$|Because most British home {{computer}} owners used tape instead of disk storage into the mid-1980s, most Spectrum software was originally distributed on audio cassette tapes. The software was encoded on tape as a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulses</b> {{that may sound}} similar {{to the sounds of}} a modern-day modem.

A [...] "zero" [...] is represented by a ~244 μs pulse followed by a gap of the same duration (855 clock ticks each at 3.5 MHz) for a total ~489 μs; [...] "one" [...] is twice as long, totaling ~977 μs.

Although the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> consecutive R-R intervals was random in 52 (70 %), patients there was a significant correlation between consecutive intervals in 22 (30 %), the correlation coefficient being negative in 11 and positive in 11.
