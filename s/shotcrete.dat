5|$|The Olympic venues were {{designed}} to reflect Norwegian culture and character. The hall was designed to play on Scandinavian folklore, such as the Hall of the Mountain King in Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt and the caves of fairy-tale trolls. This has for instance been emulated {{through the use of}} <b>shotcrete</b> on the walls to give a dark and mysterious impression. Lighting is used to create high contrast, such as from the entrance which is dark with pools of light, to the main hall which is brightly lit, to emphasize its size. The dark entrance is also used to adjust the spectators' eyes so the main hall seems brighter. A contrast has also been used between the grandstands' slender lines and the coarse finish of the cavern rock. Red was chosen as the hall's main color because of natural occurrence of red in the rock. Glass tiles are used as they give associations to ice. Ventilation, energy and other installations use shine metal, representing silver embedded in the rock. The main hall is designed as an amphitheater with close contact between spectators and athletes.|$|E

The proposed method provides the control system with the information of the properties of the pumping process, controlling the quality of the concrete layer by adjusting in real-time the trajectory of the <b>shotcreting</b> machine. Given the unstructured nature of the tunnelling construction method there is an inherent difficulty in the automation of the <b>shotcreting</b> process.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the technological enhancement of the <b>shotcreting</b> robot. The <b>shotcreting</b> robot has an arm with {{six degrees of}} freedoms, which is remotely controlled by an operator. Due to current utilization drawbacks, an improvement plan has been developed in two stages. First, the control system of the semi-automated robot was improved by {{reducing the number of}} joysticks from six to two, incorporating a real-time computer simulation model enhanced to identify model feasibility. Second, the robot was enhanced from semi-automated to fully automated. Thus, an automated profile measuring instrument is used to measure the excavated surface and a simulation model calculates the nozzle path for <b>shotcreting.</b> The automated <b>shotcreting</b> robot was completed by integrated the graphical model with the robot control system. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{necessity}} for application of activated secondary raw materials in refractory industry {{is caused by}} a growing demand for refractory castables with advanced properties and continuous technological evolution of high-temperature materials. In this investigation, refractory <b>shotcretes</b> with the same matrix composition were prepared from 15 wt. % of high aluminate cement and 45 wt. % of bauxite aggregate + 30 wt. % of chamotte filler, i. e. 75 % of corundum aggregate. The request for obtaining a low-cement castable is fulfilled by application of 10 wt. % of mechanically activated coal ash as the cement substitution in the <b>shotcretes.</b> The ash was activated by means of various high energy mechano-activators. Results were compared in order to choose the most efficient activation procedure. The properties have been studied at temperatures ranging from room temperature to adopted maximal temperature 1400 °C. Mechanisms of hydration and sintering were investigated by means of differential thermal analysis at three different heating rates. The measurements showed different activation energies for ordinary <b>shotcretes</b> and <b>shotcretes</b> with activated ash. The evolution of the refractory <b>shotcretes</b> properties was investigated and correlated to microstructural changes induced by temperature and microfiller addition. The combination of advantages in investigated refractory <b>shotcretes</b> makes them suitable for use in severe conditions at high temperature applications especially in refractory industries...|$|R
25|$|Concrete {{reinforced}} with fibers (which are usually steel, glass, or plastic fibers) is {{less expensive than}} hand-tied rebar, while still increasing the tensile strength many times. The shape, dimension, and length of the fiber are important. A thin and short fiber, for example short, hair-shaped glass fiber, is only effective during the first hours after pouring the concrete (its function is to reduce cracking while the concrete is stiffening), {{but it will not}} increase the concrete tensile strength. A normal-size fiber for European <b>shotcrete</b> (1mm diameter, 45mm length—steel or plastic) will increase the concrete's tensile strength.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the larger sculptures was {{very similar to the}} temporary Hon installation at the Moderna Museet in 1966, but this time the artworks were outdoors and needed to withstand the longterm weathering effects of sun and rain. The basic shape of the sculptures was established with frameworks made of welded steel rebar. A second layer of lighter-gauge steel reinforcement bars was added, followed by two layers of expanded metal. A specialist firm was then brought in to spray <b>shotcrete</b> onto the structure. A layer of tar for waterproofing, and a final layer of white cement produced a sturdy, hollow structure ready for decoration.|$|E

Representatives for the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature stated that they were satisfied with the end result. It is the only artificially frozen bobsleigh and luge track in the Nordic Countries. The venue was completed on 1 October 1992 and cost NOK201 million.

40|$|In many {{tunnelling}} projects {{currently under}} construction in Chile, the quality of fiber reinforced <b>shotcretes</b> (FRS) is controlled by means of its energy absorption capacity determined by testing squared panel following the EFNARC recommendation. Nevertheless, this test requires large and heavy specimens, which have to be filled when concrete is sprayed into the tunnel and does not allow testing the concrete actually placed onto the support. Due to these difficulties, the quality of fiber reinforced <b>shotcretes</b> used in some projects has been controlled {{by means of the}} Barcelona (BCN) test, which is an indirect tension test, using cores drilled from the hardened tunnel support.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a sprayable ECC in the context of material design under the guidance of micromechanical principles and rheological tools. Specifically, this study illustrates how the fresh properties suitable for wetmixture <b>shotcreting</b> may be realized, while accommodating the strain-hardening requirements imposed by micromechanical tailoring. Results from spray tests show that the fluid properties of predetermined ECC mixture are effectively modified by adopting rheological control parameters. Subsequent uniaxial tensile tests demonstrate the strain-hardening behavior comparable to that of cast ECC, for the same mixture design. One class of applications expected to benefit from sprayable ECC is repair of deteriorated infrastructures by wet-mixture <b>shotcreting</b> process.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} fundamental performances of a sprayed engineered cementitious composite (ECC) in repair systems. ECC serving as a repair material has been expected to be highly effective in providing durable repaired structures because of the tight crack width control and high delamination resistance. For this study, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber-reinforced ECC (PVA-ECC) that exhibits suitable properties for wet-mix <b>shotcreting</b> in the fresh state and strainhardening behavior in the hardened state was sprayed and tested. The experimental {{results show that the}} sprayed ECC exhibits strain-hardening behavior with strain capacities comparable with the cast ECC with the same mixture proportion. It is also revealed that when sprayed ECC is used as a repair material, both load-carrying capacity and ductility represented by deformation capacity at peak load of repaired beams in flexure are obviously increased in comparison with those of commercial prepackaged mortar (PM) repaired beams. The significant enhancement of energy absorption capacity and tight crack width control in ECC repair systems using a wet-mix <b>shotcreting</b> process suggests that sprayed ECC can be effective in extending the service life of rehabilitated infrastructure...|$|R
