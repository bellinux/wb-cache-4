Similarly, tungsten alloys have also been used in cannon shells, grenades and missiles, to create supersonic shrapnel. Germany used tungsten during World War II to produce shells for anti-tank gun designs using the Gerlich [...] "squeeze" [...] principle to achieve very high muzzle velocity and enhanced armor penetration from comparatively small caliber and light weight field artillery.

After training, rats were tested on three different sessions: sucrose reinforcement, extinction and passive sucrose presentation. In rats responding by nose poking dialysate DA increased in the shell {{but not in the}} core under reinforced as well as under extinction sessions. In contrast, in rats responding by lever pressing dialysate DA increased both in the accumbens <b>shell</b> and <b>core</b> under reinforced and extinction sessions.

In rats trained to respond for sucrose by nose poking on a FR 5 schedule dialysate DA also increased selectively in the NAc shell during reinforced responding and in both the <b>shell</b> and <b>core</b> under passive sucrose presentation. These findings, while provide an explanation for the discrepancies existing in the literature over the responsiveness of <b>shell</b> and <b>core</b> DA in rats responding for food, are consistent with the notion that NAc <b>shell</b> and <b>core</b> DA encode different aspects of reinforcement...|$|R

40|$|The {{nucleus accumbens}} {{is thought to}} subserve {{different}} aspects of adaptive and emotional behaviors. The anatomical substrates for such actions are multiple, parallel ventral striatopallidal output circuits originating in the nucleus accumbens <b>shell</b> and <b>core</b> subregions. Several indirect ways of interaction between the two subregions and their associated circuitry have been proposed, in particular through striato-pallido-thalamic and dopaminergic pathways. In this study, using anterograde neuroanatomical tracing with Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and biotinylated dextran amine as well as single-cell juxtacellular filling with neurobiotin, we investigated the intra-accumbens distribution of local axon collaterals for the identification of possible direct connections between the <b>shell</b> and <b>core</b> subregions. Our results show widespread intra-accumbens projection patterns, including reciprocal projections between specific parts of the <b>shell</b> and <b>core.</b> However, fibers originating in the core reach more distant areas of the shell, including the rostral pole (i. e. the calbindin-poor part of the shell anterior to the core) and striatal parts of the olfactory tubercle, than those arising in the shell and projecting to the core. The latter projections are more restricted to the border region between the <b>shell</b> and <b>core.</b> The density of the fiber labeling within both the <b>shell</b> and <b>core</b> was very similar. Moreover, specific intrinsic projections within <b>shell</b> and <b>core</b> were identified, including a relatively strong projection from the rostral pole to the rostral shell, reciprocal projections between the rostral and caudal shell, as well as projections within the core that have a caudal-to-rostral predominance. The results of the juxtacellular filling experiments show that medium-sized spiny projection neurons and medium-sized aspiny neurons (most likely fast-spiking) contribute to these intra-accumbens projections. While such neurons are GABAergic, the intrastriatal projection patterns indicate the existence of lateral inhibitory interactions within, as well as between, <b>shell</b> and <b>core</b> subregions of the nucleus accumbens...|$|R

Methods Conditioned rats were trained once a day for 3 days by presentation of Fonzies filled box (FFB, CS) for 10 min followed by administration of morphine (1 mg/kg), nicotine (0. 4 mg/kg) or saline, respectively.

40|$|Several studies {{investigated}} the dopamine (DA) responsiveness in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) <b>shell</b> and <b>core</b> during food self-administration (SA), but some discrepancies between results, {{probably due to}} the different methodological procedures used in each study, are shown. In order to clarify this issue we investigated by microdialysis assays the responsiveness of DA transmission in the NAc <b>shell</b> and <b>core</b> in rats responding for sucrose, using two different operant schedules: nose poking versus lever pressing. In rats trained to respond for sucrose pellets by nose poking fixed ratio 1 (FR 1) schedule, dialysate DA increased in the shell but not in the core during active responding, as well as during extinction in the presence of sucrose cues. Instead, rats responding for sucrose by lever pressing FR 1 schedule shown a strengthening of DA transmission either in the NAc <b>shell</b> and <b>core.</b> Non-contingent sucrose presentation and feeding in nose poking and lever pressing FR 1 trained animals increased dialysate DA to a similar extent in both <b>shell</b> and <b>core.</b> We can conclude that using the nose poking training, under FR 1 schedule of responding, the non-contingent sucrose feeding activates DAergic transmission in the <b>shell</b> and <b>core,</b> while, the response-contingent feeding activates DA release selectively in the NAc shell, {{as a result of the}} action of sucrose conditioned cues. At the opposite, in lever pressing trained rats, during responding for sucrose we found an increase of DA in both areas as a result of the different instrumental task required to obtain the reward.

In rats trained to respond for sucrose pellets on a fixed ratio 1 (FR 1) schedule, dialysate dopamine increased in the shell {{but not in the}} core during active responding as well as under extinction in the presence of sucrose cues.
