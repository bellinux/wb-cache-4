Brian insists that he is truly in love with her, and Arielle accepts his proposal, telling him to meet her the next day {{at the hotel}}. Valéry shows up at Brian's {{apartment}} that night; he slaps Brian and expresses anger at Brian's betrayal of the rules and boundaries of an open marriage. He then gives Brian a check for $250,000 for Brian to give Arielle the life <b>she</b> <b>deserves</b> and leaves.

Her coach is still upset about her decision to marry, but Kom makes a comeback in the National Boxing Championship.

25|$|In {{the course}} of her wanderings, Psyche comes upon a temple of Ceres, and inside finds a {{disorder}} of grain offerings, garlands, and agricultural implements. Recognizing that the proper cultivation of the gods should not be neglected, she puts everything in good order, prompting a theophany of Ceres herself. Although Psyche prays for her aid, and Ceres acknowledges that <b>she</b> <b>deserves</b> it, the goddess is prohibited from helping her against a fellow goddess. A similar incident occurs at a temple of Juno. Psyche realizes that she must serve Venus herself.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, {{people may}} {{themselves}} conclude {{that a given}} self-view is dysfunctional or obsolete and take steps to change it. Consider, for example, a woman who decides that her negative self-views have led her to tolerate abusive relationship partners. When she realizes that such partners are making her miserable, she may seek therapy. In {{the hands of a}} skilled therapist, she may develop more favorable self-views which, in turn, steer her toward more positive relationship partners with whom she may cultivate healthier relationships. Alternatively, when a woman who is uncertain about her negative self-concept enters a relationship with a partner who is certain that <b>she</b> <b>deserves</b> to view herself more positively, that woman will tend to improve the self-concept.|$|E

[...] And comparing Falstaff with Prince Hal, he proclaims, [...] "Falstaff is the better man of the two." [...] Commenting on [...] "the character of Hamlet", he in effect joins a discussion among his contemporaries, adding to the mix of similar assessments by Goethe, Schlegel, and Coleridge his observation that Hamlet [...] "is not a character marked by strength of will or even of passion, but by refinement of thought and sentiment." ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), {{the head}} {{writer of the}} sketch show TGS with Tracy Jordan, is unhappy {{about the lack of}} respect she gets from her writing staff and {{complains}} to Jack, her boss, about the situation. Jack asks her if staff writer James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell) can be promoted to co-head writer in an effort to diversify NBC. Liz accepts, seeing this as an opportunity for someone else to get the lack of respect and complaints she does. She gets upset, though, when Toofer gets a television interview as head writer, and insists that she herself should also be there as she is co-head writer. The two appear on Rutherford Rice's (Reg E. Cathey) talk show Right On, a show aimed toward African-American audiences. Liz gets visibly upset when Rice gives Toofer all of the credit <b>she</b> <b>deserves,</b> {{and as a result of}} her behavior she is escorted off the set by a security guard.|$|E

Workman was so competitive that she paid a team of French surveyors from the Service Géographique de l'Armée US$13,000 to measure the elevation of the mountain, which was actually , confirming her record. Pauly explains, [...] "Ironically, her determination to prove herself the equal of any man at lofty elevations culminated with a withering attack on an American woman who tried to surpass her". Determined {{to be the best}} woman, Workman was also a meticulous record-keeper so that she could prove her accomplishments. [...] Pauly concludes, [...] "If Fanny Workman ever receives the recognition <b>she</b> <b>deserves</b> for her feminist determination to excel at this then-male sport, she will surely be remembered as much for her insistence upon accurate record-keeping as for the elevations she achieved." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} criticism, cast members' {{performances}} were usually well received – in particular, Palmer's portrayal of Akeelah.

Virgin Media criticised the character's dress sense, stating that even though none of the family have style, that Jacqui has the most 'criminal wardrobe' out of them due to her taste for thigh high boots, skin tight dresses and huge gold earrings. Co-star Kieron Richardson branded Cooper the unsung hero of the cast claiming <b>she</b> <b>deserves</b> more recognition for her work and stated his favourite character is Jacqui.

500|$|Donna's {{relationship}} with Michael proved unpopular with critics. In an editorial discussing {{the boundaries between}} fiction and reality, The Guardian Scott Murray and Barney Ronay declared their love for Donna, commending the way she [...] "always has time for people" [...] and recommending that she stay away from Michael as <b>she</b> <b>deserves</b> better. Bree Treacy of RTÉ.ie believes that Michael had better chemistry with Donna than with his wife Annalese, however similarly commented {{that he did not}} deserve Donna, never having seen her as more than [...] "a notch on his stethoscope". Following her promotion to ward sister, Treacy hoped that the series producers would give Donna a man who would see her [...] "as more than just a good time girl." [...] Simon criticized Donna for failing to observe correct organ donation protocol in an attempt to win Michael's affection, commenting that she had [...] "thrown her own heart willynilly at the first good-looking doctor she s with an ego the size of Texas."

Seacole replied firmly that she did not [...] "appreciate your friend's kind wishes with respect to my complexion. If it had been as dark as any nigger's, I should have been just as happy and just as useful, and as much respected by those whose respect I value." [...] She declined the offer of [...] "bleaching" [...] and drank [...] "to you and the general reformation of American manners". Salih notes the use of American pidgin, against Seacole's clear English, as representational of a supposed white moral and intellectual superiority. Seacole also comments on the positions of responsibility taken on by escaped American slaves in Panama, as well as in the priesthood, the army, and public offices, commenting that [...] "it is wonderful to see how freedom and equality elevate men". She also records an antipathy between Panamanians and Americans, which she attributes in part to the fact that so many of the former had once been slaves of the latter.|$|E
500|$|Later that year, Górecki {{learned of}} an {{inscription}} scrawled {{on the wall}} of a cell in a German Gestapo prison in the town of Zakopane, which lies {{at the foot of the}} Tatra mountains in southern Poland.

Niebios Przeczysta Królowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie (Oh Mamma do not cry, no. [...] Immaculate Queen of Heaven, you support me always). The composer recalled, [...] "I have to admit that I have always been irritated by grand words, by calls for revenge. Perhaps in the face of death I would shout out in this way. But the sentence I found is different, almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble; she is seeking comfort and support in simple, short but meaningful words". He later explained, [...] "In prison, the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud: 'I'm innocent', 'Murderers', 'Executioners', 'Free me', 'You have to save me'—it was all so loud, so banal. Adults were writing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old girl, almost a child. And she is so different. She does not despair, does not cry, does not scream for revenge. She does not think about herself; whether <b>she</b> <b>deserves</b> her fate or not. Instead, she only thinks about her mother: because it is her mother who will experience true despair. This inscription was something extraordinary. And it really fascinated me." ...|$|E
