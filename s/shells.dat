5|$|The {{failure of}} the {{majority}} of the <b>shells</b> to detonate may have had various causes. As the submarines fired armour piercing <b>shells,</b> intended for use against steel ship hulls, the relatively softer brick walls may have failed to trigger the impact fuses.

The age of the <b>shells</b> may also have been a factor; some of the <b>shells</b> recovered from the Newcastle bombardment were found to be of English manufacture; surplus munitions from World War I.|$|E

The average <b>shell</b> thickness of the white <b>shell</b> eggs (. 390 mm) was significantly thicker than the brown <b>shell</b> eggs (. 368 mm).

5|$|A shell {{galaxy is}} a type of {{elliptical}} galaxy where the stars in the galaxy's halo are arranged in concentric <b>shells.</b> About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach, the centers start to oscillate around a center point, the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the <b>shells</b> of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over twenty <b>shells.</b>|$|E

The left gun of her forward 12-inch turret had been struck by an 8-inch shell that broke off its muzzle and another 8-inch shell struck {{the roof of the}} rear 12-inch turret and forced it down, which limited the maximum elevation of the left gun. Two 6-inch gun turrets had been jammed by hits from 8-inch <b>shells</b> and one of them had been burnt out by an ammunition fire.
