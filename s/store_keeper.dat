5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office <b>store</b> <b>keeper</b> he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E

25|$|Although never {{a leading}} actor, {{he made a}} number of small {{appearances}} as character actors alongside Italy's leading film stars in films throughout the early to mid-1960s and is arguably best known in world cinema for his role as the <b>store</b> <b>keeper</b> in the Sergio Leone classic Spaghetti Western film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly in 1966. His roles ranged from storekeepers and cobblers to priests and homeless men. His role of most esteem, however, is perhaps as Napoleon in Sergio Corbucci's comedy Chi si ferma è perduto in 1963.|$|E
25|$|From the {{building}} of the locks at Crook's Rapids in 1837–38, that place gradually grew into a thriving village of much importance. T. Coughlan, Esq., was the first hotel keeper and <b>store</b> <b>keeper</b> in that place. Its most marked progress took place after the chief portion of the property was acquired by Henry Fowlds, Esq., and his sons, and their removal there in 1857. A new grist and flouring mill was added to the old one, a saw mill of great power and numerous saws, capable of manufacturing large quantities of lumber yearly for the foreign market, were speedily erected.|$|E
25|$|The Papanui Hotel was {{originally}} {{built in the}} early 1850s as a parsonage for the Reverend Bradley. The building was bought in 1859 by William Meddings, a local blacksmith and <b>store</b> <b>keeper,</b> who opened it as a hotel. In 1865 the hotel was bought by William Lawrence who rebuilt the front section in 1871. Lawrence passed the hotel on to his son William in 1898, and it is believed it remained in the Lawrence family ownership until 1906. The grounds boasted gardens, lawns, fruit trees, walkways and a skittle bowling alley. In 1957 a new public and lounge bar complex {{was built on the}} corner of the Main North Road and Winstone Avenue adjacent to the old building which was finally demolished in March 1969 having served as a landmark for 110 years.|$|E

50|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 20th century the little {{township}} of Maleny grew with the dairy boom. An ES&A Bank was established in 1906, a hotel was built the next year, and there was a butcher and general store.

Sam's store is frequently checked by Youth Guards, members of a Red Guards-like uniform group, since his use of [...] "local eggs" [...] on his label is on the censor list. He doubts why [...] "local eggs" [...] must be relabeled [...] "Hong Kong eggs" [...] when they refer to the same thing. Sam finds his son Ming among a squad of Youth Guards throwing eggs at a bookstore, but Ming assures his father that he has kept his teaching in mind and has not participated in the vandalism; instead, he often leaks the censor lists and actions to bookstore keepers so that they can remain safe and preserve the books. Relaxed at his son's critical thinking, Sam reminds a bookstore keeper not to get used to such suppressive acts.|$|E
50|$|Under the White Australia {{policy of}} the nineteenth century (and with Lebanon being located in the Middle East, {{geographically}} known as South West Asia) Lebanese migrants were classified as Asians and came within the scope of the White Australia policy which intentionally restricted non-white immigration to Australia. Lebanese migrants, like others deemed non-white by Australian law, were excluded from citizenship, the right to vote and employment, and were treated as enemy aliens during World War I and World War II. In 1897 Lebanese <b>store</b> <b>keepers</b> and businesses were accused of fraud by state border Customs officers during Queensland customs prosecution cases.|$|R

50|$|Hanover was {{established}} on 12 November 1723. It {{is the smallest}} parish in Jamaica and {{was established}} from parts of Westmoreland and St James parishes. It was {{named in honor of}} the British monarch, George I, {{who was a member of}} the German House of Hanover. There had been a governmental proposal to name parish St. Sophia, after the King’s mother; however, the assembly did not approve the proposal. The parish's capital town, on the other hand, has name variations: St Lusia, St. Lucia, St. Lucea and, today, Lucea. In the early colonial days, Lucea, the main town and port, was even busier than Montego Bay. By the mid-18th century, Lucea was the hub of an important sugar-growing region, and the town was prosperous as a sugar port and market centre. European Jews settled in the parish as merchants, <b>store</b> <b>keepers,</b> haberdashery, shoe makers and goldsmiths. It became a free port.|$|R
40|$|This {{collection}} contains two diaries written by Ellen Case, wife of Rev. Philip Henry Case, describing their {{life in the}} service of the Anglican church from 1888 - 1894, as well as a volume containing copies of her letters home. The note books are in a fragile condition; they have been transcribed by her grandson, John James Case, who deposited the collection in Cory Library in December 2003, and the transcription in 2014. There are also six volumes of diaries (1944 - 1966) and a volume of poetry by her daughter, Nora Noel Case, born 27 December 1886. For a time Nora lived with her older brother Philip George Case, and her diaries describe their life on various farms, and subsequently as <b>store</b> <b>keepers,</b> in the Lower Albany area. She had trained as a school teacher. Her earlier diaries contain interesting details of day to day living and farming, and the hard physical work it entailed. Her later diaries describe social contacts in Barkly East, Bushman’s River Mouth and Queenstown, and as she was meticulous about recording weather, give an excellent overview of rainfall patterns at the time...|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1839 he formed a bushranger gang of escaped convicts which roamed in New South Wales, from Maitland to the New England Highway, in the Hunter Region, and down to Brisbane Water near Gosford. They had a main hideout at Pilcher's Mountain, near Dungog. The gang members gained a Robin Hood like reputation, for {{supposedly}} giving some of the plunder of the wealthy to their assigned convict servants, and for adopting a gallant air and flamboyant dress, and tying pink ribbons to their horses' bridles. Davis instructed his gang that violence was only permissible in order to escape capture, but in December 1840 a <b>store</b> <b>keeper's</b> clerk was killed by gang member John Shea {{in the course of}} a robbery at Scone (Davis was elsewhere in the town at the time). Davis immediately retreated with the gang to a hideout at Doughboy Hollow at Murrurundi, but they were surprised by a posse that had followed them. In the shootout, Davis was wounded in the shoulder.

50|$|Within {{two months}} a {{decision}} {{had been made to}} replace the Mulready designed stationery and essentially they were an folly. As a result of the uproar the Mulreadys were replaced with a simple design which is commonly known as the Penny Pink. The Penny Pinks were issued on 10 February 1841. Contrary to often published accounts, the Mulreadys were not withdrawn at that time. Supplies in post offices were eventually exhausted. Large supplies remained in the hands of Stamp Distributors and Sub Distributors. In November 1842, the Inland Revenue decided that those stocks should be withdrawn. The withdrawal notice was sent gradually {{over a period of time}} so that the <b>store</b> <b>keepers</b> at Inland Revenue would not be overwhelmed with the volume of returned Mulreadys. The withdrawal period lasted several years. The returned Mulreadys were stored at a warehouse until it was decided to destroy them. The first attempt was to burn them. That failed. Eventually a machine was designed and built to destroy them by punching out the center of the design. The destroyed Mulready remains were sold as waste paper to a paper maker and recycled. The Mulready stationery suffered an inglorious demise.|$|R
