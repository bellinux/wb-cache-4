Early otorrhea is usually a result of either an infection that already existed when the tube was placed, or contamination of the external auditory canal during operation. Late otorrhea is mostly a result of upper respiratory tract infection. Material and methods Our investigation was performed at the ENT Department, Mother and Child Health Care Institute in Belgrade. The research included children treated for <b>secretory</b> or recurrent <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> Results and discussion We have examined 411 children implanted with 796 tympanostomy tubes in the last three years. We investigated changes within two weeks after operation. Suppuration was recorded with 81 children (19. 7 %). Staphylococcus aureus was established in 33 (40. 7 %) Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 26 (32 %), Haemophilus influenzae in 12 (15 %) and Streptococcus pneumoniae in 10 (12. 3 %) cases. All children were treated with antibiotic ear drops according to the antibiogram for a period of 7 days. Full recovery was achieved after treatment with Ciprofloxacin drops in 67 %, Neomycin in 18 % and Gentamycin in 9 % of cases. In other cases a combination of drops and oral antibiotics was used.

Aim: To determine if children who failed the hearing screening because of conductive hearing loss have more episodes of conductive hearing impairment during their first years of life. Materials and Methods: The study group comprised 62 children who failed the screening for conductive impairment. The control was made up of 221 who passed. Both had audiologic and otolaryngological assistance and were compared regarding the occurrence of conductive disorder.

OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to assess changes in incidence of consultation rates, antibiotic prescription, and referral rates for <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in children over the years 1995 - 2003. METHODS: A cohort study including all children aged 0 to 13 years within the research database of the Netherlands University Medical Center Utrecht Primary Care Network covering the period 1995 - 2003. <b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> diagnoses were recorded according to the International Classification of Primary Care codes and antibiotic prescription according to the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical Classification System codes. <b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> incidence rates were calculated as episodes per 1000 person-years. Antibiotic prescription and referral rates were calculated per 100 <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> episodes. RESULTS: From 1995 to 2003, the overall general practitioner consultation rates for acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion declined by 9 % and 34 %, respectively. In children aged 2 to 6 years and those aged 6 to 13 years, the incidence rates of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion declined by 15 % and 41 % and 40 % and 48 %, respectively. In children < 2 years of age, the incidence rates of acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion increased by 46 % and 66 %, respectively. Antibiotic prescription rates for acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion increased by 45 % and 25 %, respectively. The referral rate for acute <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> did not change, whereas the referral rate for <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion increased by 45 %. CONCLUSIONS: Consultation rates for <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> have changed considerably over the last decade, and so have antibiotic prescriptions and specialist referrals.
