30|$|Throughout {{geological}} history, faults {{have played}} {{a very important role}} in hydrocarbon migration and accumulation. Large faults, which form the boundaries of oil and gas fields, can generally control hydrocarbon accumulation (Agosta et al. 2012; Allan 1989; Balsamo et al. 2010; Bouvier et al. 1989; Braathen et al. 2009; Brogi and Novellino 2015; Choi et al. 2015; Collettini et al. 2014; Fisher and Jolley 2007). However, small faults generally separate oil and gas, resulting in an increase in well spacing that poses challenges in oil and gas exploration. Thereby, studies of fault sealing have become a very important focus for oil and gas exploration and development (Ciftci et al. 2013; Collettini et al. 2014; Davatzes and Aydin 2005; Fachri et al. 2013 a, b). Studies of fault sealing have evolved from trap theory, which is used to identify hydrocarbon <b>sealing</b> <b>mechanism(s)</b> and physical parameters of faults (Hubbert 1953; Smith 1980). Based on different mathematical principles and modes, the sealing properties of one or more given faults are quantitatively identified and predicted by considering various <b>sealing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and factors. (Childs et al. 2009; Egholm et al. 2008; Fachri et al. 2011; Faulkner et al. 2003; Fisher and Knipe 1998; Wu et al. 2010; Knipe et al. 1997).|$|R

40|$|The static metal <b>sealing</b> <b>mechanism</b> is {{essential}} for the structural design of subsea pipeline mechanical connector. By analyzing the <b>sealing</b> <b>mechanism</b> and contact pressure on sealing face, the critical condition of the seal is obtained. Based on the superposition theorem of elasticity, the formula of critical mean contact pressure ensuring seal is deduced. The finite element analysis result of critical mean contact pressure agrees with the analysis result very well and the critical mean contact pressure decreases with the increase in pipeline wall thickness and sealing width; however, the radius of pipeline has less influence on it. The critical mean contact pressure of 8 -in subsea pipeline mechanical connector is 223. 34 [*]MPa and subsea pipeline mechanical connector is designed with ANSYS. The internal pressure experiments indicate that the sealing performance of final designed subsea pipeline mechanical connectors is higher than the design pressure of 4. 5 [*]MPa and all the initial designed ones cannot seal up to 4. 5 [*]MPa. By observing the sealing indentation on pipeline surface, when the mean contact pressure is higher than the critical mean contact pressure and the contact pressure variance is smaller, a full contact is seen to form a seal. Finally, the vibration experiments prove that the number of vibration is more than 107 and final designed subsea pipeline mechanical connector meets the experiment specification...|$|E
