5|$|Crystallographic {{structure}} of fsTnI in troponin complex from chicken fast skeletal muscle showed an overall structure {{similar to that}} of cardiac troponin. The inhibitory region of fsTnI was resolved in skeletal troponin whereas it was invisible in the cardiac troponin crystal structure. Based on the crystal structure, a <b>schematic</b> illustration (Fig. 3) was proposed to show the conformational changes in troponin during muscle activation and relaxation.|$|E
5|$|Much of Xenogears {{plot and}} backstory is {{detailed}} in the Japanese-only book Xenogears Perfect Works. This book, {{produced by the}} now defunct DigiCube, details {{the history of the}} Xenogears universe from the discovery of the Zohar {{to the start of the}} game. According to the Perfect Works <b>schematic</b> (as well as the game's end credits), Xenogears is the fifth episode in a series of six, with events spanning multiple millennia.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{both the}} old and new Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets. Despite some attempts at demolition, the underground complex remained largely undisturbed until 1988–89. During reconstruction of that area of Berlin, the sections of the old bunker complex that were excavated were for the most part destroyed. The site remained unmarked until 2006, when a small plaque with a <b>schematic</b> diagram was installed. Some corridors of the bunker still exist, but are sealed off from the public.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Raymond's {{office had}} {{accepted}} {{a commission to}} design a dormitory for the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, part of French India in southeast India. A preliminary site visit was made by George Nakashima and the <b>schematic</b> design was completed in 1936. Although Raymond had envisioned that the dormitory would be completed in six months, Sri Aurobindo was concerned that the noise of construction would disturb the ashram, so he decided that the building would be constructed by its residents.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to finding weaponry {{out in the}} wastelands, the player can also create their own. To craft such weapons, the player must use a workbench, possess either the necessary schematics or the right Perk, and scavenge for the items needed to make them. These weapons usually possess significant advantages over other weapons of their type. Each weapon's <b>schematic</b> has three copies that can be found, and possessing additional copies improves the condition (or number) of items produced at the workbench, while a higher repair skill {{will result in a}} better starting condition for the related weapon. Weapon schematics can be found lying in certain locations, bought from vendors, or received as quest rewards.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 2006, {{during the}} lead-up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, an {{information}} board was installed {{to mark the}} location of the Führerbunker. The board, including a <b>schematic</b> diagram of the bunker, {{can be found at the}} corner of In den Ministergärten and Gertrud-Kolmar-Straße, two small streets about three minutes' walk from Potsdamer Platz. Hitler's bodyguard, Rochus Misch, one of the last people living who was in the bunker at the time of Hitler's suicide, was on hand for the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The seductive details {{effect has}} {{primarily}} been demonstrated {{at the point}} of knowledge acquisition (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the <b>schematic</b> representation of information that trainees form during instruction. Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to organize information. However, when learners are applying knowledge, empirical studies suggest that the distortion of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Alongside his collaborations with Dada artists {{on various}} pieces, Tzara {{himself was a}} subject for visual artists. Max Ernst depicts him as the only mobile {{character}} in the Dadaists' group portrait Au Rendez-vous des Amis ("A Friends' Reunion", 1922), while, in one of Man Ray's photographs, he is shown kneeling to kiss the hand of an androgynous Nancy Cunard. Years before their split, Francis Picabia used Tzara's calligraphed name in Moléculaire ("Molecular"), a composition printed {{on the cover of}} 391. The same artist also completed his <b>schematic</b> portrait, which showed a series of circles connected by two perpendicular arrows. In 1949, Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti made Tzara the subject of one of his first experiments with lithography. Portraits of Tzara were also made by Greta Knutson, Robert Delaunay, and the Cubist painters M. H. Maxy and Lajos Tihanyi. As an homage to Tzara the performer, art rocker David Bowie adopted his accessories and mannerisms during a number of public appearances. In 1996, he was depicted on a series of Romanian stamps, and, the same year, a concrete and steel monument dedicated to the writer was erected in Moinești.|$|E
25|$|Boys {{are less}} willing to state they have {{negative}} feelings about sex than girls when they describe their sexual self-schemas. Boys are not divided into positive and negative sexual self-concepts; they are divided into <b>schematic</b> and non-schematic (a schema is a cluster of ideas about a process or aspect of the world; see schema). Boys who are sexually <b>schematic</b> are more sexually experienced, {{have higher levels of}} sexual arousal, and are more able to experience romantic feelings. Boys who are not <b>schematic</b> have fewer sexual partners, a smaller range of sexual experiences and are much less likely than <b>schematic</b> men to be in a romantic relationship.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} is to draw the small-signal <b>schematic</b> for the {{amplifier}} with the two-port in place using the hybrid-pi model for the transistors. Figure 5 shows the <b>schematic</b> with notation R3 = RC2 // RL and R11 = 1 / g11, R22 = g22.|$|E

25|$|The {{results of}} the survey were striking. The two more <b>schematic</b> models were {{rejected}} – K overwhelmingly. Of the two naturalistic models, M received somewhat more support than P. IALA decided on a compromise between P and M, with certain elements of C.|$|E
25|$|New {{words can}} be derived {{internally}} – that is, from existing Interlingua words – or extracted from the control languages {{in the manner of}} the original vocabulary.

25|$|Figure 7 {{shows the}} small-signal <b>schematic</b> {{with the main}} {{amplifier}} and the feedback two-port in shaded boxes. The feedback two-port satisfies the port conditions: at the input port, Iin enters and leaves the port, and likewise at the output, Iout enters and leaves.|$|E
25|$|Together, these {{definitions}} are broad {{enough to}} encompass physical engineering models {{used in the}} verification of a system design, as well as <b>schematic</b> models like a functional flow block diagram and mathematical (i.e., quantitative) models used in the trade study process.

25|$|The carpets of Ganja are {{notable for}} {{peculiarity}} of their compositions and ornamental patterns. The Ganja carpets include {{a relatively small}} number of carpet compositions, all in all between 8 and 20 patterns. The Kazakh carpets cover about 16 compositions with various patterns. Kazakh, which is located on the NW of Azerbaijan, is the most famous carpet production region and also accounts for the Kazakh and Borchaly carpet groups. The Kazakh carpets have a geometrical ornamental pattern, the composition is not very complex with a focus on a <b>schematic</b> presentation of the geometrical patterns, plants and animals. The ornamental decor of the Ganja carpets is rich and diverse, with a focus on geometrical motifs as well as <b>schematic</b> presentation of plants and animals.|$|E

25|$|Some lenses {{fixed in}} ancient Egyptian statues are {{much older than}} those {{mentioned}} above.
