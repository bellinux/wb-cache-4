As 1981 and the locomotive's 150th birthday approached, the Smithsonian started discussions on how best to commemorate the locomotive's age and significance. There was very little question that special publications and exhibits would be prepared, but museum officials were left with the thought that the exhibit could still be <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> that.|$|E

She pointed to later movies, such as Mamma Mia!, 27 Dresses (written by McKenna) and Me Before You, that appeared to her to be trying to replicate The Devil Wears Pradas success with that demographic.

Windows10's stock applications were praised for being improved over their Windows 8 counterparts, and for supporting windowed modes.

In conclusion, it was argued that [...] "Windows10 delivers the most refined desktop experience ever from Microsoft, and yet it's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> that.

[...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard felt that the real triumph was Ocean's song structure: [...] "verses and hooks collapse onto each other, rhymes pop up out of nowhere, and the singer acts like minutely balancing a 10-minute concept piece is no big deal." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post Company described the track as a [...] "righteous funk opus that spans nearly 10 minutes", commented that it [...] "is loaded with metaphorical riddles, drawing parallels between Cleopatra and a 21st-century prostitute.

500|$|Michael Cavna of The Washington Post wrote {{positively}} {{about the}} episode, commenting that from [...] "the one-liners of the episode’s dinosaur-show opening (reminding that a prime-time 'fossil' like The Simpsons still has sharp comedic bicuspids) {{to the final}} trick up 'Neil Gaiman’s' dark sleeve, 'The Book Job' is worthy of the show’s DVD wall of fame." [...] Cavna particularly praised the episode for being based on real-life publishing, noting how Selman drew inspiration from the article on Alloy Entertainment. He also commended the parodies of the Ocean's Trilogy and Far Side, and Gaimain's guest appearance. Cavna wrote that [...] "Gaiman’s role is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> mere walk-on. Like the show’s very best guest voice performances, here Gaiman is called upon to lend true dimension to the episode." [...] Similarly, Cyriaque Lamar of io9 wrote that the episode [...] "did justice to Gaiman's guest appearance...in that it made the author look like a total nutcase." [...] He added that [...] "Gaiman gamely depicts himself as a goony spaniel. Sure, Andy García guest-starred too, but Gaiman stole the show." [...] In addition, Lamar praised the episode for several of its gags, including the Far Side reference and the disclosures of Patty being able to speak fluent Dothraki and Twilight originally revolving around golems.|$|E
500|$|The three coinage bills—Maine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary—were {{considered}} {{in that order}} by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. As the Maine and Alabama pieces were considered, Ohio's Warren Gard asked {{a number of questions}} about various matters, including regarding the wisdom of having so many half dollar designs issued, though he did not object to the passage of either bill. After the Pilgrim bill came to the floor, Gard asked Walsh why the bill provided for 500,000 half dollars, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> for the state coins; Walsh responded that it was because the coin was for a 300th anniversary rather than just a 100th. [...] Gard followed up this point, asking {{if it had been a}} 400th anniversary, whether even more coins would be justified, and Walsh agreed. Both Walsh and Vestal were asked by Gard how many half dollars were in circulation, but neither legislator knew. Washington Representative John Franklin Miller asked whether the coin was to commemorate the original landing of the Pilgrims at Provincetown or their subsequent landing at Plymouth, but Walsh did not answer the question definitively. Congressman James W. Dunbar of Indiana noted that the price of silver had risen so high that the Mint might be out of pocket in striking the coins, and asked if the federal government would cover any losses; Vestal responded that Massachusetts would. Vestal then moved the committee amendment to reduce the authorized mintage from 500,000 to 300,000, attracting the attention of Gard, who asked the reason for the change and was told the original bill had a typographical error. Walsh had told the committee that he had selected the figure of 500,000 since the Pilgrim anniversary was more important than the Maine state centennial. Gard enquired if the amendment had been approved by the committee, and when he was told it had, asked if the Pilgrim half dollars would buy more than ordinary half dollars to which Walsh replied, [...] "why, I think very likely, especially on Cape Cod." [...] Gard indicated his hope that he could spend a few days there that summer, and Vestal stated that Gard would be welcome to obtain and spend half dollars in any of the three states celebrating anniversaries. The bill passed the House without recorded opposition.|$|E
