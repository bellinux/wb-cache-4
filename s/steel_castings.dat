50|$|This pistol was an {{approximate}} {{copy of the}} Baby Browning and was designed as such {{in order to avoid}} copyright infringement claims from FN, which at that time still had US patent protection on various components of the Baby Browning pistol. For example, the Bauer copy was produced using 416 stainless <b>steel</b> investment <b>castings</b> while the FN Baby Browning slide and receiver were originally produced from 8620 steel billet, though in the 1950s were produced from 8620 <b>steel</b> investment <b>castings.</b> The Bauer utilized a different auto safety spring and the barrel was removed (and the slide released from the receiver) by twisting it clockwise 45 degrees from top dead center, rather than counterclockwise, {{as is the case with}} the Baby Browning pistol. The Bauer has engraving on both sides of the slide, whereas the FN Baby Browning has engraving only on the side of the slide opposite the ejection port side.|$|R

2500|$|The {{dome seating}} {{area in the}} Vista Dome was {{comparatively}} limited: 24, with an additional 46 standard seats on the lower level. In the early 1950s Pullman developed a [...] "full-length" [...] design, with the dome seating area stretching {{the length of the}} car. This design posed several challenges. The full-length glass roof (...) necessitated a new, powerful air-conditioning system from a dedicated diesel motor. The massive weight of the car, , required reinforced three-axle trucks from General <b>Steel</b> <b>Castings.</b> Much of this weight was concentrated in the glass dome, which meant new framing techniques to support the second level above the first. The result was an -long dome level which could seat 68, nearly three times that of the Vista Dome. The lounge area beneath seated 28 in booths.|$|E

50|$|The Type CZ {{condensing}} tenders {{were slightly}} longer than their engines. One-third {{of the total}} length of the tender was {{taken up by the}} water tank and coal bunker, while the rest was taken up by eight large radiators on each side, cooled by five steam-driven roof-mounted fans. Roller bearings were used throughout on all these locomotives, including the coupling and connecting rods, the crosshead gudgeon pins as well as the three-axle bogies of both the standard and condensing tenders. The leading bogies and coupled wheels had Cannon-type axle boxes. The cylinders and frames were cast in one piece, while the steel cylinders and steam chests were fitted with cast iron liners. The tender frames of both locomotive types were also one-piece <b>steel</b> water-bottom <b>castings.</b> Since they were entirely mounted on roller bearings, very little effort was required to move these big locomotives.|$|R
