Conventional larviciding is restricted by high operational costs and inadequate knowledge of mosquito-breeding habitats in rural settings that might be overcome by the juvenile hormone analogue, Pyriproxyfen (PPF). This study assessed the potential for Anopheles arabiensis to pick up and transfer lethal doses of PPF from contamination sites to their breeding habitats (i. e. autodissemination of PPF). A semi-field system (SFS) with four identical separate chambers was used to evaluate PPF-treated clay pots for delivering PPF to resting adult female mosquitoes for subsequent autodissemination to artificial breeding habitats within the chambers. In each chamber, a tethered cow provided blood meals to laboratory-reared, unfed female An. arabiensis released in the SFS. In PPF-treated chambers, clay <b>pot</b> <b>linings</b> were dusted with 0. 2 - 0. 3 g AI PPF per pot. Pupae were removed from the artificial habitats daily, and emergence rates calculated.

As a result there has been considerable and ongoing research internationally on the penetrating chemical species and phases that form in the carbon cathode lining of the cell. The objective of the study is to identify phases that penetrate, react and cause expansion of carbon cathode during the electrolytic production of aluminium. The study relied upon post-mortem carbon cathode samples from South African aluminium smelting plant {{and the development of a}} laboratory scale aluminium smelting cell. Samples were analysed using qualitative and quantitative x-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, with energy dispersive spectroscopy.

40|$|International audienceThe {{literature}} {{on the presence of}} heavy metals in contaminated wastes is reviewed. Various categories of materials produced from domestic and industrial activities are included, but municipal solid waste, which is a more complex material, is excluded. This review considers among the most abundant the following materials - wood waste including demolition wood, phytoremediation scavengers and chromated copper arsenate (CCA) timber, sludges including de-inking sludge and sewage sludge, chicken litter and <b>spent</b> <b>pot</b> liner. The partitioning of the metals in the ashes after combustion or gasification follows conventional behaviour, with most metals retained, and higher concentrations in the finer sizes due to vaporisation and recondensation. The alkali metals have been shown to catalyse the biomass conversion, particularly lithium and potassium, although other metals are active to a lesser extent. The most prevalent in biomass is potassium, which is not only inherently active, but volatilises to become finely distributed throughout the char mass. Because the metals are predominantly found in the ash, the effectiveness of their removal depends on the efficiency of the collection of particulates. The potential for disposal into soil depends on the initial concentration in the feed material...|$|R

SPL is classified into first and second cut; the first cut is mainly composed of conductive graphite while the second cut consists of refractory insulator bricks. Generally, the 1 st cut SPL is a hazardous material with contaminants of fluorides, cyanides, lead and chromium in addition to production of flammable gases when it contacts water.

40|$|Groundwater {{contaminated}} with <b>spent</b> <b>pot</b> liner leachate (SPLL) {{was treated with}} calcite (CaCO₃) and CO₂ {{in a series of}} free drift batch reactor kinetic experiments with the aim of optimizing fluoride removal. In order to better understand the reaction kinetics for SPLL, the pseudo-second order (PSO), four and five parameter Hill (Hill 4 & Hill 5) models were applied to observed fluoride removal as a function of CO₂ partial pressure and stirring rate. To account for differences in the number of model parameters, model fitting was compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Schwartz Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the statistical F-test. In every case, the best fitting model order was found to be Hill 5 > Hill 4 > PSO due to the ability of the Hill models to accommodate sigmoidal kinetics. Removal of fluoride from SPLL under atmospheric CO 2 conditions was found to be inhibited with no removal occurring for the first 3000 min with the inhibition times, based on the reaction half-life, reducing with increased CO₂ partial pressure and stirring rate. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that the residual solid filtrate consisted of trona (Na₃(CO₃) (HCO₃) · 2 H₂O) a potentially valuable mineral kogarkoite (Na₃SO₄F) and fluorite (CaF₂) accounting for fluoride removal, and unreacted calcite (CaCO₃) ...|$|R

It is accountable for CO 2, NOX, SO 2 emissions and some heavy metal discharge from the pre-calciner kiln system which causes severe greenhouse effects. Energy efficiency improvement and how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are thus most important areas of research. This paper focuses on reducing pollutants emissions by optimizing the usage of alternative fuels.

Both “one factor at a time” and “taguchi method”, “Response Surface Methodology” approaches for optimization have been adopted to get the significant process parameters such as alkali concentration, acid concentration, L/S ratio and temperature. A feasibility study was also conducted in cryolite precipitation at two different pH. XRD, SEM-EDX, proximate and ultimate analysis were done on the SPL samples for mineralogical as well as elemental analysis. The carbon percentage of SPL has been increased from 42. 19 to 87. 03 % as confirmed from the ultimate analysis.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the metastable zone width (MSZW) of aluminium hydroxyfluoride hydrate (AHF, AlFOH. HO) crystallizing solution, {{with a view}} to identifying suitable conditions for crystal growth. Speciation calculations combined with experimental validations have been used to estimate the degree of saturation at varying pHs leading to the identification of the metastable zone width (MSZW). From the results obtained, the solutions are saturated at pH 3. 0 ± 0. 3 and remain metastable until the nucleation threshold is reached at pH 5. 0 ± 0. 3. A narrowing of the MSZW at elevated temperatures has been observed and is attributed to the decrease in AHF solubility with increasing temperatures. This phenomenon was applied to obtain a tripling of the crystal particles in 30 minutes. The pH profile of the crystallizing solution {{is similar to that of}} acid/base titration curves and is found to be a quick and accurate method of estimating the MSZW. Using similar terminologies, the equivalent point corresponds to solution saturation while the mid-point corresponds to the nucleation threshold.

In this project chemical leaching treatment method was adopted and several process parameters and their dependency on each other were studied. SPL was subjected to caustic leaching followed by HNO 3 leaching at different temperature and liquid to solid ratio combinations. Again an optimized set of values was obtained via Taguchi method. The main objective of the optimization methodology {{was to determine the}} effect of acid concentration, alkali concentration, temperature and L/S ratio on the leaching percentage in terms of percentage contribution. Alkali concentration contributed 51. 80 % in the leaching process, whereas acid concentration contributed only 2. 61 %. The maximum leaching percentage was found out to be 50. 62 % by Taguchi optimization. It was concluded that 2. 5 M NaOH, 5 M HNO 3 concentration, 4. 5 L/S ratio and temperature 75 ± 1 °C was the best combination for the optimum leaching percentage for final treated SPL. The carbon percentage of SPL was increased from 33. 27 % to 87. 31 % as confirmed from the elemental composition obtained by Enegry Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Again with the help of existing data, an extensive comparison was made to find out the best suitable acid out of HCl, HNO 3, H 2 SO 4 and HClO 4 for leaching process keeping L/S ratio constant.

40|$|The {{aluminium}} industry is continually facing {{the problem to}} lower the energy consumption and to increase the productivity by improving the current high amperage cell technology. Another challenge is to eliminate cell failures, which cause disturbances or premature cell shutdowns. The degradation of the cathode lining and cathode heave {{are two of the}} key factors which influence the performance and lifetime of the cathode, and the present study has focused on these two phenomena. Autopsies of cathodes after pot failures or shutdowns of cells have frequently been used to identify the cause of pot failures and the degradation of the cathode lining. The sequence of materials observed from the carbon cathode to the non-reacted refractory lining has been considered to reflect the situation in the lining before the pot was taken out of service. In this work it was demonstrated that this is not necessary the case based on annealing experiments of <b>spent</b> <b>pot</b> lining (SPL) samples and X-ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy of the corresponding specimens. The annealing experiments demonstrated that the thermal gradient in the lining is reversed during cooling and that the physical appearance of the lining reflects a combination of the cooling and operation of the cell. A revised view of the analysis of SPL is presented taking into consideration the presence of a molten phase below the carbon cathode. This molten phase consists mainly of bath components and is therefore non-viscous in nature. Solid particles originating from the pristine material or precipitated reaction products are also possibly present. Since the cell is well insulated in the bottom the cathode lining is cooled from the top to the bottom when the cell is shut down. Thus the molten phase solidifies from top to the bottom in the lining, which was supported by the experimental findings. Sodium was identified to govern the degradation of the refractory lining based on electron microprobe analysis of the reaction front in the SPL. Since only sodium was found in the first few millimeters of the reaction front, this region was termed the "first reaction front". Furthermore, fluorides originating from the penetrating bath were detected in a certain distance and this was denoted the "second reaction front". The strong reductive nature of sodium was demonstrated by Si(s) droplets found in the SPL down to the first reaction front. The presence of Si also permitted a possible explanation for the nature of the transport of sodium from the carbon cathode to the reaction front. Inside and below the carbon cathode Na(g) is dissolved and transported through the bath. Below the build-up layer oxidation of Na(g) to Na + takes place accompanied by the reduction of SiO 2 to Si(s). Reported data on the mobility of the different ions in relevant viscous melts revealed that in contrast to diffusion of sodium, the mobility of oxygen is strongly dependent on the viscosity of the molten phase formed at the reaction front. Furthermore it was proposed that the degradation reaction with sodium is faster than the diffusion. Thus the rate limiting step for the degradation of refractory linings is the mobility of O 2 − ions. The viscous barrier was therefore proposed as a barrier for the diffusion of O 2 − and F − and not Na+ ions as previously proposed. The chemical reactions caused by sodium infiltration were qualitatively explained by the construction of a chemical degradation map. The degradation map corresponds to a predominance phase diagram showing the stable phases present as a function of SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio in the refractory lining and the amount of sodium infiltrated in the lining. Through experimental observations it was demonstrated that the degradation map is a useful tool for the evaluation of autopsies of SPL and the prediction of the mineralogical composition of SPL. The thermal conductivity of SPL samples was determined by the Laser Flash method. The results demonstrated that the thermal conductivity decreases with increasing temperature. Compared to the pristine materials the SPL exhibited an increase in thermal conductivity, which depends on the respective density and chemical composition. It was possible to distinguish between crystalline and amorphous materials. This was also reflected by the measurements of the top and bottom part of the lens build up. Simulations of the heat transfer in cathode bottom linings were performed to study the consequences of the increase in thermal conductivity due the chemical degradation. The simulations showed that an overall increase in heat loss occurred, but was damped by the decrease of cathode block thickness and the growth of the build-up layer. Moreover, the importance of an the insulation layer with respect to a stable thermal balance was addressed. It has been shown in this study that a significant amount of liquid phase is present below the carbon block during operation. The buoyancy force in the liquid phase has previously been suggested to contribute to the cathode heave. Estimation of the forces demonstrated that the buoyancy force alone is not enough to lift a cathode block and cause the observed cathode heave. Computer simulations in 2 D using finite element method were performed to identify the stress level acting on the collector bar and to identify possible forces leading to the cathode heave phenomenon. The influence of sodium expansion was also taken into consideration. The simulation demonstrated that the forces acting upwards are indeed caused by thermal expansion and by the sodium infiltration of the carbon block. The thermal expansion of the materials was proposed to be the main reason for the cathode heave and that the chemical expansion due to sodium infiltration gives an additional contribution to the stress build up. The "weak part" of the cell lining was identified, which corresponds to the region in the lining with the strongest temperature gradient. The deformations obtained by the simulations were qualitatively consistent with typical observation of cathode heave. PhD i materialteknologiPhD in Materials Technolog...|$|R
40|$|Negative {{impacts on}} the marine {{environment}} due to commercial fishing provide incentive {{for the development of}} environmentally sound fishing methods. Instead of trawling, the Maori-owned Waikawa Fishing Company (WFC) seeks to use unbaited fish pots; a low impact method with reduced bird and mammal bycatch, and reduced fuel use. Prior research demonstrated only 20 % of catch values from WFC’s Z pot design achieved the required $ 35 break-even catch value identified by prior study. In order to increase catch values to an economic level, this study generated information and recommendations around pot design and potting methodology, which was provided to the WFC, to enhance the matauranga (traditional knowledge) that design and methodology decisions are based on. A six- week field trial tested variations of pot design, mesh type, region, soak time and collapsibility. The amount of variation caused by methodology indicated economically viable catch values can be achieved using the existing Z design, in contrast to an initial focus on design changes as the solution. Economically viable catch values from Z pots increased from 20 % (in prior research) to 33 % in the present study, indicating methodological improvement; this is likely to continue as WFC’s potting experience increases. The Z pots (mean $ 28. 54) caught higher values than a new S pot design (mean $ 11. 77). Increased catches of higher value large fish in Z pots was possibly due to funnel design; an avenue for further research. Standard mesh was the best economic option, although undersized fish bycatch in all three mesh types indicates further research is required to develop an environmentally appropriate mesh type or escape gaps. Region had a large effect on catch value; standard mesh Z pots at Cape Campbell (mean $ 33. 59) produced higher values than Cape Jackson (mean $ 9. 05). Catch values increased with soak time; four day soaks gave higher catch values (mean $ 33. 38, $ 0. 35 /hr), but one day soaks gave higher hourly catches (mean $ 13. 45, $ 0. 56 /hr); fuel usage will determine the optimal soak time. Collapsibility had no effect on catch value; a useful factor for increased capacity for small boats. In-situ video of behavioural responses to pot entrance design indicated minor behavioural differences influence catch rates. The probability of fish entering the Z entrance (P= 0. 09) was higher than the S (P= 0. 04), and increased with the amount of time <b>spent</b> around the <b>pot.</b> 1. 5 % of fish approaches resulted in capture, highlighting the passive mechanism of potting, and indicates huge potential for increased catch values with design modification. Video demonstrated variation in the habitat-scale location (i. e. distance from reef) of pot deployments. Given the variation in field trial catch values within each region, habitat-scale location is potentially an important factor of catch value. The percentage of catch values reaching the break-even point can be achieved with refined methodology, particularly regional and habitat-scale location choices. WFC’s Z pot is suitable for economically viable commercial fish potting; design modification is not immediately required, but is an avenue for increases to catch value once methodological parameters are optimised...|$|R
