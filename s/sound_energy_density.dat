40|$|We {{investigate}} the physical properties of a purely kinetic k-essence model with an {{equation of state}} motivated in superconducting membranes. We compute the equation of state parameter w and discuss its physical evolution via a nonlinear equation of state. Using the adiabatic speed of <b>sound</b> and <b>energy</b> <b>density,</b> we restrict the range of parameters of the model {{in order to have}} an acceptable physical behavior. Furthermore, we analyze the evolution of the luminosity distance d_L with redshift z by comparing (normalizing) it with the ΛCDM model. Since the equation of state parameter is z-dependent the evolution of the luminosity distance is also analyzed using the Alcock-Paczyński test.

40|$|In this paper, the {{validity}} of the Fick's law of diffusion in room acoustics is experimentally investigated inside long rooms. The room-acoustics diffusion model relies on Fick's law stating a proportionality relationship between <b>sound</b> intensity and <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> gradient inside a room through a constant diffusion coefficient. This relationship is investigated in the stationary state for the particular case of long rooms with different amounts of boundary scattering. Measurements were performed inside a 1 : 16 scale model, using a p-u sound intensity probe (calibrated with digital filters) to collect concurrent data in terms of sound pressure and axial velocity components. Then for each receiver position, <b>sound</b> intensity and <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> gradient were derived. The results show that inside long rooms the diffusion coefficient is not a constant but increases with the distance from the source with a slope depending on the scattering coefficient of the walls. Numerical simulations of the enclosures were performed too by using a sound particle-tracing code; a substantial agreement with the experimental findings is observed. The results imply that for such long enclosures, the diffusion model should consider a space-varying diffusion coefficient to be more consistent with real phenomena...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of anaerobic digestion for biogas production and achieve the resource recovery and decrement of antibiotic bacterial residue, ultrasonic/alkaline pretreatment is used to treat penicillin bacterial residues (PBR), the influence of pH value, ultrasonic <b>sound</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density,</b> moisture content and reaction time on pretreatment effect are investigated, and the biodegradability of PBR is evaluated by biochemical methane potential (BMP) test. The orthogonal experiment result shows that ultrasonic/alkaline pretreatment can enhance the residue cell wall broken effect, and promote intracellular organic matter dissolution. The optimum pretreatment conditions are pH of 10, ultrasonic <b>sound</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> of 2  0 W/mL, moisture content of 97 %, and pretreatment time of 5 min. In this case, the highest COD dissolution rate can reach 84. 69 %, which is 2. 08 times higher than that by the ultrasonic pretreatment only. The BMP test {{results show that the}} impact of the pretreatment factors is as follows: moisture content > ultrasonic <b>sound</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> > reaction time > pH value.

40|$|Unlike the {{well-known}} computation of <b>sound</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> {{based on the}} concept of sound intensity and on the assumptions of geometrical acoustics, in this paper a newcomputational scheme is developed and experimentally verified. Though keeping the basics of the geometric theory, the newmethod is based {{on the concept of}} force density in the acoustic field. It is shown that, starting from the single force contribution of each image source, the outcome of the global force acting at the receiver point is easily computed. The <b>sound</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> evaluated with the new method differs from previous theories. As a consequence, the derived predictions of both reverberation time and sound energy level are different. The consistency of this newmethod with available experimental data is investigated and newdata are added that provide evidence in favour of the newcomputational scheme. The relation between this procedure and current formulas for reverberation time is studied and discussed, too, and an improvement of Eyring’s formula is proposed...|$|E

40|$|The {{modeling}} of the macroscopic propagation of sound inside porous media is usually based on first order acoustical quantities. Single or multiple layers {{are treated as}} an equivalent impedance network which can be also solved with a transfer matrix formulation. In this work the one dimensional, time averaged, macroscopic sound transfer process in rigid-frame porous media is reinterpreted with the concepts developed {{in the field of}} sound intensity. An algebraic derivation shows that the active intensity is proportional to the spatial gradient of the <b>sound</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density,</b> so that the two quantities obey a diffusion equation. The name sound conductivity is suggested for the related coefficient, and the expressions of the sinks of sound energy and of the sources of reactivity in the material are formalized. Moreover a differential formulation for the energy densities inside the material is developed and solved analytically...|$|E

40|$|It is {{discussed}} a physical vacuum excitation {{as a mechanism}} of sonoluminescence of gas bubble. This Schwinger’s theory {{was based on the}} assumption that the sudden change of the collapse rate of bubble in the water leads to the jump of the dielectric constant of gas. It is shown that the dependence of the dielectric constant on the gas density really leads to the jump of the dielectric constant at the shock-wave propagation in a collapsing gas bubble. Sonoluminescence is a transformation of sound into the light. The liquid (it can be the distillate water) is incurred to the acoustic waves, and photons are radiated at that. The radiated light energy is comparable with introducing sound energy. The <b>sound</b> <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> is of the order 10 − 11 eV/atom, and as the energy of radiation photons is of the order 10 eV, one can say that the density of the energy is increases in 1012 times.
