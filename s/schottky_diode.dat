40|$|APPLICATION NOTE This {{application}} note describes {{the advantages of}} using Low Forward Voltage (Vf) <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> {{in a variety of}} applications. The lower voltage drop results in a significant increase in efficiency. Lower Forward Voltage Drop Figure 1 shows the relative improvement in forward voltage drop, Vf, with the DSN 2 <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> technology. The comparison is made to industry SOD− 323 EP <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes.</b> It is clear that such a significant improvement can have major impact on the efficiency of many circuit applications. The forward voltage drop of the DSN 2 <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> is shown in Table 1. The data are taken from the typical data charts on the data sheet at 25 °C at the devices rated specifications. A comparison can be made between a 20 V device and a 30 or 40 V device. Four surface mount footprints are shown, 0201, 0402, 0502 and 0603. The forward voltage drop is presented at rated currents. All <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> have a negative temperature coefficient of approximately 1 mV/°C.

2500|$|The crystal {{detector}} demodulates the radio frequency signal, extracting the modulation (the audio signal {{which represents the}} sound waves) from the radio frequency carrier wave. In early receivers, the detector was a cat's whisker detector [...] consisting of a fine metal wire, the [...] "cat's whisker", on an adjustable arm that touched a pea-sized lump of semiconducting mineral. The point of contact between the wire and the crystal produced a diode effect. [...] The cat's whisker detector was a crude <b>Schottky</b> <b>diode</b> that allowed current to flow better in one direction than in the opposite direction. Modern crystal sets use modern semiconductor diodes. [...] The crystal functions as an envelope detector, rectifying the alternating current radio signal to a pulsing direct current, the peaks of which trace out the audio signal, {{so it can be}} converted to sound by the earphone, which is connected to the detector.|$|E
2500|$|Base {{triggering}} input circuit: {{the input}} trigger signal is fed {{directly to the}} base via a fast switching diode , possibly after being shaped by a pulse shaping network. This way of driving an avalanche transistor was relatively less employed in first generation circuits because the base node has a relatively low impedance and an input capacitance [...] which is highly nonlinear (as a matter of fact, it is exponential) under the large signal regime: this causes a fairly large, input voltage dependent, delay time, which was analyzed in detail in the paper [...] However, the required inverse voltage for the feed diode is far lower respect diodes {{to be used in}} collectior trigger input circuits, and since ultra fast Schottky diodes are easily and cheaply found, this is the driver circuit employed in most modern avalanche transistor circuit. This is also the reason why the diode [...] in the following applicative circuits is symbolized as a <b>Schottky</b> <b>diode.</b>|$|E

Although these <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> were clearly rectifying, their I-V characteristics were non-ideal which can be judged from the non-linearity in the semi-logarithmic plots. Careful analysis of the forward bias I-V characteristics on log-log scale indicates space-charge-limited current (SCLC) conduction dominates the current transport in these GaN <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes.</b> The concentration of the deep trapping centers {{was estimated to be}} higher than 10 (15) cm(- 3). In the deep level transient spectra (DLTS) measurements for the GaN <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes,</b> deep defect levels around 0. 20 eV below the bottom of the conduction band were identified, which may act as the trapping centers. The concentration of the deep centers obtained from the DLTS data is about 5 x 10 (15) cm(- 3).

40|$|<b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> {{based on}} {{semiconducting}} single-walled carbon nanotubes {{are being developed}} as essential components {{of the next generation}} of submillimeter-wave sensors and sources. Initial performance predictions have shown that the performance characteristics of these devices can exceed those of the state-of-the-art solid-state <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> that have been the components of choice for room-temperature submillimeter-wave sensors for more than 50 years. For state-of-the-art <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> used as detectors at frequencies above a few hundred gigahertz, the inherent parasitic capacitances associated with their semiconductor junction areas and the resistances associated with low electron mobilities limit achievable sensitivity. The performance of such a detector falls off approximately exponentially with frequency above 500 GHz. Moreover, when used as frequency multipliers for generating signals, state-of-the-art solid-state <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> exhibit extremely low efficiencies, generally putting out only micro-watts of power at frequencies up to 1. 5 THz. The shortcomings of the state-of-the-art solid-state <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> can be overcome by exploiting the unique electronic properties of semiconducting carbon nanotubes. A single-walled carbon nanotube can be metallic or semiconducting, depending on its chirality, and exhibits high electron mobility (recently reported to be approx. = 2 x 10 (exp 5) sq cm/V-s) and low parasitic capacitance. Because of the narrowness of nanotubes, <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes</b> based on carbon nanotubes have ultra-small junction areas (of the order of a few square nanometers) and consequent junction capacitances of the order of 10 (exp - 18) F, which translates to cutoff frequency > 5 THz. Because the turn-on power levels of these devices are very low (of the order of nano-watts), the input power levels needed for pumping local oscillators containing these devices should be lower than those needed for local oscillators containing state-of-the-art solid-state <b>Schottky</b> <b>diodes...</b>|$|R
