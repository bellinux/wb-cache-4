50|$|This {{species is}} a black {{salamander}} with yellow spots on its back as warning coloration, but none on its belly. It has <b>smooth,</b> <b>shiny</b> <b>skin,</b> usually with four large, yellow blotches on the head. Various subspecies have different patterns of colours, for example, S. i. orientalis is virtually identical to S. i. infraimmaculata, but has {{a large number of}} yellow dots all over its body. However, the validity of this subspecies is in question. Another subspecies, S. i. semenovi, has a more rounded head and rose-shaped spots over the top part of the body. It can grow to 324 mm in length with S. i. infraimmaculata being the largest subspecies. Females are in general larger than males.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} on {{the fruit}} are the scabs {{that the disease}} is named for. They appear as raised bumps with irregular borders and can be brown or purple in color. The lesions are generally 3mm in diameter but have been measured up to 10mm. The texture of the scabs are rough and cracked which {{is in contrast to}} the <b>smooth</b> and <b>shiny</b> avocado <b>skin.</b> The dramatic differences in color and texture make it easy to identify the scabs on host trees. Procession of the infection leads to fusion of the discrete scabs to form larger rutted patches. These areas may crack, exposing the vulnerable tissue underneath and allowing secondary organisms such as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides to penetrate into the fruit tissue and cause anthracnose.|$|R
40|$|Background: Lucio’s {{phenomenon}} {{is a rare}} manifestation of untreated leprosy which is seen almost exclusively in regions surrounding the Gulf of Mexico. Its occurrence elsewhere though documented is considered uncommon. We present a case of Lucio’s phenomenon in a previously undiagnosed leprosy patient who presented to us with its clas-sical skin manifestations. Case presentation: A 64 year old South Asian (Sri Lankan) male {{with a history of}} chronic obstructive airway disease presented to us with fever and cough. He had a generalized <b>smooth</b> and <b>shiny</b> <b>skin</b> with ulcerating skin lesions afflict-ing the digits of the fingers. The lesions progressed to involve the extremities of the body and healed with crusting. Based on the clinical and investigational findings Tuberculosis and common vasculitic conditions were suspected and excluded. The unusual skin manifestations prompted a biopsy, and wade fite stained revealed Mycobacterium bacilli. In context of the clinical picture and histological findings, Lucio’s phenomenon was suspected. A clinical diagnosis of Lucio’s phenomenon occurring in the backdrop of lepromatous leprosy was made. Conclusion: Though leprosy is still a prevalent disease, it has manifestations that are not easily recognized or fully appreciated. Regional patterns of atypical manifestations should not limit better understanding of rarer manifesta-tions as it will aid in clinching an early diagnosis and instituting prompt treatment, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality...|$|R
