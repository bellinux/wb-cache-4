5|$|A {{separate}} 2008 <b>study</b> <b>from</b> Western Michigan University {{found that}} hybrids and conventional vehicles are equally safe when travelling {{more than about}} , because tire and wind noise generate most of the audible cues at those speeds.

All Prius models used in the study engaged their internal combustion engines when accelerating from a standstill and produced enough noise to be detected.|$|E

5|$|A <b>study</b> <b>from</b> 2005 {{concluded}} that heat waves significantly increased in frequency, persistence and spatial {{coverage in the}} decade 1991-2000, {{when compared to the}} period between 1971–80 and 1981-90. A severe heat wave in Orissa in 1998 resulted in nearly 1300 deaths. Based on observations, heat wave related mortality has increased in India prior to 2005. The 2015 Indian heat wave killed more than 2,500 people.|$|E
5|$|A <b>study</b> <b>from</b> 2008 {{indicates}} that sexual dimorphism occurs early during this species' ontogeny. L.canarium males reach sexual maturity at a shorter shell length {{when compared to}} females. Individuals {{are considered to be}} adult by the time the outer lip of their shell is noticeably thickened and flared; growth to adult size takes about a year. The maximum life span of the dog conch differs between sexes; it is estimated at 2 and 2.5 years for females and males, respectively.|$|E
5|$|A <b>study</b> <b>from</b> the University of California, Los Angeles {{estimated}} in 2007 that extending marriage rights to same-sex couples {{would result in}} a net gain of approximately $3.2 million each year to the state budget. The study drew on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Maryland statistical reports. The gain is attributable to savings in expenditures on means-tested public benefit programs and an increase in sales and lodging tax revenue from weddings and wedding-related tourism.|$|E

5|$|As Yelp {{became more}} influential, the {{practice}} of fake reviews written by competitors or business owners became more prevalent.

5|$|Edmontosaurin {{specimens}} {{from the}} Prince Creek Formation of Alaska formerly assigned to Edmontosaurus sp. {{have been given}} their own genus and species name, Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis. However, the identification of Ugrunaaluk as a separate genus was questioned by a 2017 <b>study</b> <b>from</b> Hai Xing and colleagues, who regarded it as a nomen dubium indistinguishable from other Edmontosaurus. Edmontosaurus was also reported from the Javelina Formation of Big Bend National Park, western Texas based on TMM 41442-1, but was later referred to Kritosaurus cf. navajovius by Wagner (2001), before being assigned to Kritosaurus sp. by Lehman et al.

5|$|In 1970 the United States Congress {{repealed}} mandatory {{penalties for}} cannabis offenses and The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act separated cannabis from other illicit narcotics and removed mandatory sentences {{for possession of}} small amounts of cannabis.

The Commission found that the constitutionality of cannabis prohibition was suspect and that the executive and legislative branches had a responsibility to obey the Constitution, {{even in the absence}} of a court ruling to do so.

5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{have studied the}} {{surviving}} Pipe rolls, using them {{as the basis for}} study of financial and governmental history, especially of the medieval era. A <b>study</b> <b>from</b> 1925 compiled the royal income that passed through the Exchequer for each year of Henry II and Richard I, as well as a sample of some years from John's reign, attempting to compare how the royal revenues compared in the various reigns. Recent work by Nick Barratt on the reigns of Richard and John have updated the earlier research. Historian David Carpenter has carried out further studies on the early years of King Henry III's reign. The Pipe rolls have also been used to identify royal officials, especially those that were involved in local government and were not high ranking. Because they recorded judicial fines, the Pipe rolls also can be used to shed light on how the judicial system in medieval England worked, as well as identifying royal judges. Although they don't provide exact revenue figures, most historians believe they represent a close approximation of revenue, and can be used to gain a general understanding of how much financial resources the English kings had available in the Middle Ages.|$|E
