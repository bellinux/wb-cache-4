5000|$|In March 2017, {{following}} Ranallo's {{absence from}} commentary and Aries' return to in-ring action, Graves would {{be joined by}} Tom Phillips on commentary for 205 Live. On the May 29 episode of Raw, Graves would directly report to Raw general manager Kurt Angle about some [...] "scandalous information" [...] that was sent to him about Angle, with Angle telling Graves [...] "if this is true, it could ruin me". On the June 19 episode of Raw, as Angle tried to resolve the mystery of who attacked both Enzo and Cass {{over the last few}} weeks, Graves would show security footage of Big Cass faking his attack, which led to Cass to reveal himself as the one who attacked Enzo Amore, before attacking Amore once again, officially disbanding the team. Graves would continue to <b>support</b> <b>Angle</b> about his personal information that was sent to him, which Angle would reveal on the July 17 episode of Raw, announcing that Jason Jordan was his storyline son.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a welding nozzle position manipulator. The manipulator consists of an angle support to which the remaining components of the device are attached either directly or indirectly. A pair of pivotal connections attach a weld nozzle holding link to the angle support and provide a two axis freedom of movement of the holding link {{with respect to the}} <b>support</b> <b>angle.</b> The manipulator is actuated by a pair of adjusting screws angularly mounted to the angle support. These screws contact a pair of tapered friction surfaces formed on the upper portion of the welding nozzle holding link. A spring positioned between the upper portions of the <b>support</b> <b>angle</b> and the holding link provides a constant bias engagement between the friction surfaces of the holding link and the adjustment screws, so as to firmly hold the link in position and to eliminate any free play in the adjustment mechanism. The angular relationships between the adjustment screws, the angle support and the tapered friction surfaces of the weld nozzle holding link provide a geometric arrangement which permits precision adjustment of the holding link with respect to the angle support and also provides a solid holding link mount which is resistant to movement from outside forces...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{beginning}} of {{motion of particles}} {{at the bottom of}} a water channel is a result of a rather complex interaction between the flow and the particles. Using a simplified bed model it is possible to easily study and isolate the interactions between the flow and the bed and to better define the conditions leading to the {{beginning of}} bed particles motion. A theoretical approach that takes into account the different parameters such as <b>support</b> <b>angle</b> and turbulence intensity, is presented and compared with the Shields diagram and experimental results. This study is the first phase of a broader research project in course who aims to better understand and explain the beginning of sediment particles motion. ...|$|E

40|$|With {{regard to}} {{substrate}} deformation, this work analyzed the microcantilever beam-bending test {{and provided a}} closed formula of deflection versus load. The substrate deformation was formulated using two coupled springs; the spring compliances {{were related to the}} elastic compliances of the substrate, the <b>support</b> <b>angle</b> between the substrate and the microcantilever beam, and the beam thickness. Finite element analysis was conducted to calculate the spring compliances and verify the analytic formula. The results showed that the proportionality factor of the load to the deflection was a third-order polynomial of the length from the loading point to the fixed beam end. Examples are also given to indicate the relative error of Young's modulus when evaluated with the beam-bending theory without considering the substrate deformation...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{nonlinear}} tilted {{support spring}} damping system is proposed in this paper. The nonlinear dynamic equation is developed under the foundation displacement excitation and the resonance {{frequency of the}} system is also analyzed. Furthermore, different support angles affecting the vibration amplitude and the natural frequency of the system are researched. The model of the tilted support spring damping system is analyzed by ANSYS, and modal analysis and harmonic response analysis are made under harmonic excitation. The study shows that the supporting angle makes a great impact on the amplitude of the system and the response amplitude {{of the system is}} also reduced with the decrease of <b>support</b> <b>angle.</b> Through the analysis and comparison of the example, it provides a theoretical basis of the analysis for the tilted support spring damping system support angle’s optimal design...|$|E
40|$|Light gauge metal {{sheeting}} {{is often}} utilized {{in the building}} and bridge industries for concrete formwork. Although the in-plane stiffness and strength of the metal forms are commonly relied upon for stability bracing in buildings, the forms are generally not considered for bracing in steel bridge construction. The primary difference between the forming systems in the two industries is the method of connection between the forms and girders. In bridge construction, an eccentric <b>support</b> <b>angle</b> is incorporated into the connection details to achieve a uniform slab thickness along the girder length. While the eccentric connection is a benefit for slab construction, the flexible connection limits the amount of bracing provided by the forms. This paper presents results from {{the first phase of}} a research study investigating the bracing behavior of metal bridge deck forms. Shear diaphragm tests were conducted to determine the shear stiffness and strength of bridge deck forms, and modified connection details were developed that substantially improve the bracing behavior of the forms. The measured stiffness and strength of diaphragms with the modified connection often met or exceeded the values of diaphragms with conventional noneccentric connections. The experimental results for the diaphragms with the modified connection details dramatically improve the potential for bracing of steel bridge girders by metal deck forms...|$|E

40|$|There {{are very}} few {{scientific}} studies about fishing rods {{in the field of}} the so-called sports-leisure. This study deals with large deformation of fishing rods that would be useful {{in the development of the}} characteristic design of fishing rods. In this report, based on the nonlinear large deformation theory, new fundamental equations are introduced for thin, straight tapered fishing rods with a circular cross-section under concentrated loads at the free end. As a result, it is found that the large deformations of fishing rods can be described by non-dimensional load parameters, ratios of rod diameters and <b>supporting</b> <b>angles.</b> Furthermore, the experimental verification of this analysis is carried out using a flexible rod model. The theoretically predicted results are in fairly good agreement with the experimental data. Consequently, the new deformation theory is proved to be of practical use...|$|R

Outcome measures were head–neck alignment <b>angles,</b> <b>support</b> <b>angles</b> of the backrest, and pressure distributions on the supporting surfaces. Compared with a typical wheelchair that has a flat backrest, the seat pressure decreased and the center of pressure was located in the middle of both the seat and backrest in the N-WC.

40|$|The {{analytical}} {{investigation on}} the transverse free vibrations of the rectangular plate supported at the periphery and at oblique edges inside {{the interior of}} the plate is reported in this paper. The effects of the edges inside {{the interior of the}} plate on the free vibrations of the plate is taken into account by replacing the edges with rows of the point supports, which produce restraining forces acting on the plate so that the plate def 1 ection is zero at the each point support, and this problem of vibrations of the plate is strictly solved based on the fundamental differential equation of the plate. The resulting compatibility equation provides the desired natural frequency equation. As examples, simply supported rectangular plates with a interior edge are illustrated. Comparisons with results obtained by the energy method and experiment, effects of the <b>supporting</b> <b>angle</b> on the natural frequencies, and the vibration mode shape are presented.

40|$|Permanent metal deck forms (PMDFs) {{are often}} used in the bridge {{industry}} to support wet concrete and other loads during construction. Although metal formwork in the building industry is routinely relied on for stability bracing, the forms are not permitted for bracing in the bridge industry, despite the large in-plane stiffness. The forms in bridge applications are typically <b>supported</b> on cold-formed <b>angles,</b> which allow the contractor to adjust the form elevation to account for changes in flange thickness and differential camber between adjacent girders. Although the <b>support</b> <b>angles</b> are beneficial toward the constructability of the bridge, they lead to eccentric connections that substantially reduce the in-plane stiffness of the PMDF systems, {{which is one of}} the reasons the forms are not relied on for bracing in bridge applications. This paper documents the results of an investigation focused on improving the bracing potential of bridge deck forms. Modifications to the connection details were developed to improve the stiffness and strength of the forming system. Research included buckling tests on a 15 -m (50 -ft) long, twin-girder system with PMDFs for bracing. In addition, twin-girder tests were also used to validate computer models of the bracing systems that were used for parametric finite-element analytical studies. The buckling test results demonstrated that modified connection details make PMDF systems a viable bracing alternative in steel bridges, which can significantly reduce the number of cross-frames or diaphragms required for stability bracing of steel bridge I-girders during construction.
