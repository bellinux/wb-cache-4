5|$|The {{result of}} the uneven bars final, in which Britain's Beth Tweddle placed 4th, was called into {{question}} after documents were found that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Chinese gymnasts He Kexin and Yang Yilin were only 14, and therefore under the age required to compete, {{at the time of}} the games. An investigation into their ages was launched by the IOC to determine whether it was necessary to disqualify them, thus Tweddle's standing could have been changed to 2nd, giving her a silver medal. After a five-and-a-half-week investigation the Chinese athletes were cleared and the original results allowed to stand.|$|E

25|$|This {{alliance}} {{shed light}} on how the English viewed themselves and {{their role in the}} New World. While Indians {{in other areas of the}} New World (such as Hispaniola) were being treated poorly by European masters, and other nations were actively engaged in the slave trade, the English prided themselves on the thought that they were “liberators” who allied with these black slaves against the Spanish. Such an alliance <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the English were free of racial prejudices, even though they were actively involved in the slave trade themselves.|$|E

500|$|By 1987 the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency {{estimated}} {{the army was}} 40,000 strong (with Ethiopian army strength estimated {{at the same time}} as 260,000). The President, Mohamed Siad Barre, held the rank of Major General and acted as Minister of Defence. There were three vice-ministers of national defence. From the SNA headquarters in Mogadishu four sectors were directed: 26th Sector at Hargeisa, 54th Sector at Garowe, 21st Sector at Dusa Mareb, and 60th Sector at Baidoa. Thirteen divisions, averaging 3,300 strong, were divided between the four sectors – four in the northernmost and three in each of the other sectors. The sectors were under the command of brigadiers (three) and a colonel (one). Mohammed Said Hersi Morgan has been reported as 26th Sector commander from 1986 to 1988. Walter S. Clarke <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Barre's son [...] was commanding the 77th Sector in Mogadishu in November 1987.|$|E

2500|$|The Huffington Post writer, G. Roger Denson, countered this, {{saying that}} the filmmakers were being made scapegoats for {{information}} openly admitted by government and intelligence officials. Denson said that Leon Panetta, three days after Osama bin Laden's death, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that waterboarding was a means of extracting reliable and crucial information {{in the hunt for}} bin Laden. Denson noted Panetta speaking as the CIA chief in May 2011, saying that [...] "enhanced interrogation techniques were used to extract information that led to the mission's success". Panetta said waterboarding was among the techniques used. In a Huffington Post article written a week later, Denson cited other statements from Bush government officials saying that torture had yielded information to locate bin Laden.|$|E
2500|$|On May 9, 1887, Buffalo Bill's Wild West {{opened in}} London. Among the {{audience}} members was Queen Victoria, {{who visited the}} Earl's Court encampment three days later. [...] Black Elk recalled that Natives were told [...] "that Majesty was coming. I {{did not know what}} that was at first, but I learned afterward. It was Grandmother England who owned Grandmother's Land where we lived awhile after the Wasichus murdered Crazy Horse." [...] Red Shirt expressed his pleasure in meeting the Queen and remarked to her that [...] "I have come many thousands of miles to see you. Now that I have seen you, my heart is glad." [...] The encounter and his words were widely circulated among the press and noted in her diary. Since the death of Prince Albert, her husband, which event had occurred thirty years previous to this [...] "command," [...] the queen had been more than ordinarily seclusive. She seldom appeared before great assemblages of her subjects and her visits to even her parliament were rare. To theatrical performances she never went during that long period of her mourning. Her latest knowledge of the greatest actors and actresses of the time was gained by private performances given, by command, in her court, and these were infrequent. [...] "The Wild West was altogether too big a thing to take to Windsor Castle, and {{as in the case of}} Mahomet and the mountain, as the Wild West could not go to the Queen it became absolutely necessary for the Queen to go to the Wild West, if she desired to see it, and it was evident that she did." [...] "Then I presented Red Shirt, the Native Chieftain, who was gorgeous in war paint and feather trappings. His proud bearing was fetching among the royal party, and when he spoke through an interpreter, saying he had come a long way to see her Majesty and [...] "felt glad," [...] the Queen smiled appreciatively, and as the red man, unconventionally, but proudly, strolled away with the dignity of a Supreme Court Judge, she <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "I know a real prince when I see him." [...] "Every act went with a rush and a cheer, and was received by cries of 'bravo,' 'well done,' etc. At the close of the exhibition calls were made for Red Shirt and myself, in response to which I thanked my patrons and assured them that the recollection of that evening's display of kindness would ever be fresh in my memory. Cries of 'Bravo, Bill,' and the singing of 'For he's a jolly good fellow' by the entire audience brought the demonstration to a close." ...|$|E
