5|$|Colbert has won nine Primetime Emmy Awards, two Grammy Awards, and two Peabody Awards. Colbert {{was named}} one of Times 100 Most Influential People in 2006, and 2012. Colbert's book, I Am America (And <b>So</b> <b>Can</b> <b>You!),</b> listed #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Colbert dropped {{hints of}} a {{potential}} presidential run throughout 2007, with speculation intensifying following the release of his book, I Am America (And <b>So</b> <b>Can</b> <b>You!),</b> which was rumored (invariably by Colbert himself) to {{be a sign that}} he was indeed testing the waters for a future bid for the White House. Colbert staunchly refused to confirm or deny his candidacy, stating he had not yet made up his mind and must first talk the possibility over with his family.|$|E
5|$|Colbert has {{released}} one book associated with The Colbert Report, I Am America (And <b>So</b> <b>Can</b> <b>You!).</b> It {{was released on}} October 7, 2007, by Grand Central Publishing. Grand Central Publishing is the successor to Warner Books, which published America (The Book), written by The Daily Show staff. The book contains similar political satire, but was written primarily by Colbert himself {{rather than as a}} collaboration with his Colbert Report writing staff.|$|E

Three books were released to accompany the show's humor, the first being I Am America (And <b>So</b> <b>Can</b> <b>You!),</b> released both in print and as an audiobook in 2007. In 2012, two spinoff books of the show were released. America Again is a sequel to the show's first book, and addresses topics including Wall Street, campaign finance, energy policy, healthcare, eating on the campaign trail, and the United States Constitution. Another book, I Am a Pole (And <b>So</b> <b>Can</b> <b>You!),</b> was released the same year and purports to be a children's book {{telling the story of}} a fictional pole finding its purpose in life.|$|E

500|$|Colbert first {{appeared}} as a correspondent on Comedy Central's news parody series The Daily Show in 1997 and remained a regular contributor until 2005, when he left to host The Colbert Report, a spin-off show satirizing personality-driven political pundit programs. He has also been featured {{in a number of}} other public performances, most notably at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, and as the author of the books I Am America (And <b>So</b> <b>Can</b> <b>You!),</b> I Am a Pole (And <b>So</b> <b>Can</b> <b>You!),</b> and [...]|$|E
500|$|Colbert's fictional {{history is}} not always rigidly adhered to by the show's writers. The comedian himself says that, [...] "My character's history {{may not always be}} {{perfectly}} consistent ... There's my bio and there's my character's bio, and then there's my character's history, which is slightly different than my character's bio." [...] His early life, prior to becoming host of The Colbert Report, is expanded upon in I Am America (And <b>So</b> <b>Can</b> <b>You!).</b>|$|E
500|$|Colbert is {{the central}} {{character}} in the 2007 book I Am America (And <b>So</b> <b>Can</b> <b>You!).</b> Co-written with Paul Dinello and the writers of The Colbert Report, I Am America delves into what the character considers {{to be the most}} pressing issues facing America. The book takes influence from the literary endeavors of the character's pundit models, such as O'Reilly's The O'Reilly Factor (2000) and Hannity's [...] (2004), which Colbert says he [...] "forced" [...] himself to read as a reference. I Am America is considered a pure extension of the Report; the written medium allowed the writers to employ different styles, such as long-format arguments, that they could not have used on television. [...] "You can actually spend 20 pages talking about religion whereas in the show, two pages is about as long as we hold any one idea", Colbert explains. In doing this, the writers [...] "discovered things that [...] cared about that... they didn't know he cared about before".|$|E

500|$|One day, whilst {{working on}} On the 6, Jennifer Lopez [...] "happened to be" [...] {{recording}} {{at the same}} recording studio where American recording artist Marc Anthony was recording. Anthony, who had become intrigued by Lopez after seeing her in Selena (1997), came into her studio {{and asked her to}} appear in the music video for his song [...] "No Me Conoces". She agreed, but only if he recorded a song with her, to which he in turn agreed. Lopez recalled the events on her [...] video album by stating: [...] "So at that time I called Tommy [...] and I'm like 'Look, so Marc Anthony said he would do a song and I really don't want to do a duet with just anybody, I want to do a duet with him. <b>So</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> force him to sign something, so he has to do a record with me? If I do this video!'". The two first shot the video and then began working on the song.|$|E
500|$|Under his fictional persona in The Colbert Report, Colbert dropped {{hints of}} a {{potential}} presidential run throughout 2007, with speculation intensifying following the release of his book, I Am America (And <b>So</b> <b>Can</b> <b>You!),</b> which was rumored to {{be a sign that}} he was indeed testing the waters for a future bid for the White House. On October 16, 2007, he announced his candidacy on his show, stating his intention to run both on the Republican and Democratic platforms, but only as a [...] "favorite son" [...] in his native South Carolina. He later abandoned plans to run as a Republican due to the $35,000 fee required to file for the South Carolina primary, however he continued to seek a place on the Democratic ballot and on October 28, 2007, campaigned in the South Carolina state capital of Columbia, where he was presented with the key to the city by Mayor Bob Coble.|$|E
500|$|Branch's {{music has}} gained {{prominence}} {{as a result}} of its use during the 2012 Republican presidential primary. When she was performing [...] "I Am America" [...] at events across the country, Herman Cain was often the keynote speaker. Branch and her husband came to appreciate his political views and her husband signed on with Cain's campaign. [...] "I Am America" [...] was later adopted by the candidate as his campaign's official theme. Cain said when interviewed about the song, [...] "The first time I heard that song, the message was so right-on I felt goose bumps just listening to it." [...] The song was later described by the National Journal as having [...] "underscored Cain's anti-elitist appeal" [...] with its lyrics. Campaign ads featuring [...] "I Am America" [...] gave the song increased exposure. A campaign ad using [...] "I Am America" [...] that included Cain's chief of staff was the subject of numerous parodies also featuring the song. On The Colbert Report, comedian Stephen Colbert satirically claimed Cain got the line [...] "I Am America" [...] from Colbert's book, I Am America (And <b>So</b> <b>Can</b> <b>You!).</b> Several parodies of the ad were then shown on the program using the song.|$|E

500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The Rings of Ahkaten" [...] {{was held}} on 17 October 2012, with filming beginning the next week on 22 October. Director Farren Blackburn had previously worked on the programme in the 2011 Christmas special [...] "The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe". According to Matt Smith, there were [...] "between 50 and 60 prosthetic aliens" [...] in a scene set in an alien market. The Doctor features minimally in the first act because Smith was busy filming pick-ups or reshoots for [...] "Nightmare in Silver". Millennium FX's Neill Gorton remarked that he had [...] "always {{wanted to do a}} scene like the Star Wars cantina" [...] and had worked on different moulds in his spare time in case they could be used in the future, as making thirty different aliens at one time would be out of the budget. Much of the episode was constructed around talks of what could be created with limited resources. For example, Cross recalled that producer Marcus Wilson called him and asked, [...] "We've always wanted to have a speeder-bike like in Return of the Jedi and we {{know how to do it}} inexpensively, <b>so</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> get one into the story?" [...] However, Cross felt that the speeder-bike ended up having more in common with Flash Gordon. The songs were written by composer Murray Gold. To help establish the year at the beginning of the episode [...] "Ghost Town" [...] by The Specials is heard and the Doctor is seen reading a 1981 copy of The Beano. The issue of The Beano was reprinted and included in a special Doctor Who-themed edition on 15 May 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Atwood celebrated her 70th {{birthday}} at a {{gala dinner}} at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, marking the final stop of her international tour to promote The Year of the Flood. She stated {{that she had}} chosen to attend the event because {{the city has been}} home to one of Canada's most ambitious environmental reclamation programs: [...] "When people ask if there's hope (for the environment), I say, if Sudbury can do it, <b>so</b> <b>can</b> <b>you.</b> Having been a symbol of desolation, it's become a symbol of hope." ...|$|E
2500|$|His last single, [...] "Nineteen", {{released}} {{a few weeks}} before his death, was produced by Paul Hardcastle. It bore no relation to the producer's chart-topping single of the same title some months earlier. [...] "This was a guy whose records I used to play when I was at school," [...] said Hardcastle. [...] "He was a hero of mine – I couldn't work out why he wanted to work with me. He said to me, 'You're {{at the top of your}} game technically right now, <b>so</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> help me?'" [...] The producer played the bassline on Lynott's Fender. [...] "He walked in on me playing it and I thought, 'Shit!' said Hardcastle. [...] "But he said, 'That's fokken great – we're keeping that on there." ...|$|E

5000|$|In Indian logic it {{has long}} been {{traditional}} to claim that there are four kinds of claims. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> affirm that X is <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> deny that X is <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> neither-affirm-nor-deny that X is <b>so,</b> or <b>you</b> <b>can</b> both-affirm-and-deny that X is <b>so.</b> Each claim <b>can</b> also take one of four truth-values true, false, neither-true-nor-false, and both-true-and-false. However the tradition is clear that the four kinds of statements are distinct from the four values of statements. [...] Nagarjuna is sometimes interpreted as teaching that there is a fifth logical quality besides the four typical of Indian logic, but there are disputing interpretations.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the week}} prior to announcing his candidacy, Colbert {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} talk shows to promote his book I Am America (And <b>So</b> <b>Can</b> <b>You).</b> [...] During these interviews, he parodied potential candidates' standard approach to a White House run, giving broad and generally unprompted hints towards a campaign on shows like Larry King Live. [...] "A lot of people see this book as testing the waters for a run for political office," [...] he told King in an October 14, 2007 interview. On the same day, Colbert took over The New York Times opinion columnist Maureen Dowd's column, which he used to engage in similar speculation: [...] "I know why you want me to run, and I hear your clamor...Nevertheless, I am not ready to announce yet – even though it's clear that the voters are desperate for a white, male, middle-aged, Jesus-trumpeting alternative." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nobody's Daughter was {{released}} on April 26, 2010 worldwide on Mercury Records, and was received by music critics with moderately positive acclaim. Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars, but noted [...] " [...] was an absolute monster vocalist in the nineties, the greatest era ever for rock singers... She doesn't have that power in her lungs anymore – barely a trace. But at least she remembers, and that means something in itself." [...] The magazine also referred to the album as [...] "not a true success", but a [...] "noble effort". Love's voice, which had been noticeably raspier (likely due to years of scream-singing, drug abuse, and smoking) was compared {{to the likes of}} Bob Dylan. NME gave the album a 6/10 rating, and Robert Christgau rated it an [...] "A-", saying, [...] "Thing is, I can use some new punk rage in my life, and unless you're a fan of Goldman Sachs and BP Petroleum, <b>so</b> <b>can</b> <b>you.</b> What's more, better it come from a 45-year-old woman who knows how to throw her weight around than from the zitty newbies and tattooed road dogs who churn most of it out these days. I know—for her, BP Petroleum is just something else to pretend about. But the emotion fueling her pretense is cathartic nevertheless." [...] In support of the release, Hole toured extensively between 2010 and 2012 throughout North America and Europe, as well as performing in Japan, Russia, and Brazil.|$|E
