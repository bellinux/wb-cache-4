In the aftermath, Posey suffered a fractured fibula and torn ligaments in his ankle, requiring season-ending surgery. Cousins, who was not disciplined, said he collided with Posey intentionally in order to score. [...] "If you hit them, you punish them and you punish yourself, but you have a chance of that ball coming out." [...] He expressed regret over injuring Posey, saying [...] "I certainly didn’t want him to get hurt." [...] Cousins received threats from fans, but Posey denounced them: [...] "I appreciate the continued support of Giants fans and others as I begin the process of working my way back ... But in no way do I condone threats of any kind against Scott Cousins or his family. As I <b>said</b> <b>last</b> week, I'm not out to vilify Scott." [...] In 45 games, Posey batted [...]284 with 17 runs scored, 46 hits, five doubles, four home runs, and 21 RBI.|$|E

2500|$|Currently, {{there still}} are many {{remaining}} concerns as to where storage of nuclear waste should be stored or even if a central location is required. On May 24, 2011, the Institute for Policy Studies {{came out with a}} new report ranking various spent fuel sites and contending that spent nuclear reactor fuel needs to be moved en masse into safer dry cask storage rather than the current liquid pool system. However, Harry Reid brushed aside such remarks with the contention that transport to a central site increases risks. [...] "Leave it on-site where it is," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>last</b> year. [...] "You don't have to worry about transporting it. Saves the country billions and billions of dollars.

[...] Also the report cited Canadian eye-witnesses of how the riots turned violent and how some of them escaped with help from taxi drivers and guides. Another report described in detail how Canadian traveller Justin Winfield from Toronto helped to save a Han Chinese from mobs and took him to a local hospital along with two women.|$|E

That's something that they have to deal with and they dealt with it and they did the best they can do with they system. This is just how it is. Our players are really excited about going where we're going." [...] Vice President for ASU Athletics Lisa Love said. [...] "Playing a perennial power like the University of Texas, December 27 in the Holiday Bowl, which, by the way, is wonderfully hosted by that committee. This is a great, step forward.

2500|$|In {{an article}} by Tim Hanson that {{appeared}} in the Spokesman Review article on August 26, 1984 Schuckardt is quoted as saying: [...] "If there is some way I can just let the people know we didn't run away. We were sent away. We were thrown out of our home. If there was anyway we could have stayed there, we would have. They must know that it was made impossible." [...] The article goes on to state that On June 7, 1984 Chicoine filed a lawsuit in Superior court asking that Schuckardt and 10 of his associates be prohibited from returning to the church property at Mount St. Michael's or Schuckardt's mansion at E2314 South Altamont Blvd. As a result of this lawsuit, a document was served at his mansion. The article states: [...] "Schuckardt <b>said</b> <b>last</b> week he thought the document was an eviction notice rather than an order to appear in court. He also believed an arrest warrant had been issued." [...] Bruce Erickson, a Spokane attorney representing Chicoine stated: [...] "There wasn't any warrant out for his arrest. I or the court or the sheriff's department can't force them to read the documents". Schuckardt left the mansion during the second week of June. The article went on [...] "either Schuckardt nor a legal representative appeared in court. The court therefore issued an order banning the bishop from church property." [...] Spokane County sheriff detectives confirmed that no warrant exists for Schuckardt. The court later ruled that Bishop Schuckardt had never been given proper legal notice of the pending action and overturned its original judgment against him and a handful of his followers.|$|E

2500|$|After the trawl {{had been}} {{dragging}} {{for some time}} on the ocean bottom in 65 fathoms, it was raised and the crew stood by to receive the catch. Those with experience of mine sweeping during the war were startled when the mine tumbled out on deck. It stood about four feet high with a diameter of two feet and weighed about five cwt. Long immersion and rolling about {{on the ocean floor}} had made the mine harmless. The cap and firing mechanism were gone, and there was no cable. A quantity of explosive still remained. This was taken out and the mine brought back to Sydney where the trawler berthed yesterday morning. Any marks of identification are hidden by a heavy marine growth. Captain J. Farquhar, master of the Koraaga, who gained a knowledge of mines while fishing In the North Sea, <b>said</b> <b>last</b> night that he believed the mine had been cut adrift from a minefield during sweeping, and after going to the bottom was carried south by the current. It was possible, he said, that the Koraaga was responsible for rendering the mine harmless, since she swept the Gabo field with the Brolga and Gunundaal. The Gabo minefield was first discovered by one of the State trawlers, and that before the danger area was properly swept the Cumberland was blown up. [...] "The laying of the mines by the Wolf was very cleverly done," [...] he said. [...] "They were put down at night in an area that was {{in full view of the}} Gabo lighthouse during daylight." [...] The mine will be retained by Mr. Cam among the many curiosities that have been brought back to Sydney by his trawlers.|$|E
2500|$|Needless to say, the Orangist party {{saw things}} differently. Their {{adherence}} to the Prince of Orange's dynastic interest was partly {{a matter of personal}} advancement, as many Orangist regents resented being ousted from the offices they had monopolized under the Stadtholderate. But many people also had a genuine ideological attachment to the [...] "monarchical" [...] principle. Calvinism felt theological unease with a political system that did not have a Prince at its head, as such a system {{did not seem to be}} justifiable in biblical terms (at least if one overlooked the Book of Judges in preference to Books of Kings). As the analogy of the Dutch Republic with the biblical People of Israel was never far from people's minds, this helped to give an important underpinning for the Orangist claims in the mind of the common people, who were greatly influenced from the pulpit. Of course, the Public Church thought its interests best served by the Stadtholder, as the Erastianism of the Holland regents was seen as a constant threat to its independence. An example of what this threat might entail was the controversy about the formulary the States of Holland imposed in 1663 for prayers in favor of the government. Such prayers were said as a matter of routine in Dutch Reformed churches throughout the life of the Republic; it was an uncontested obligation following from its status as the Public Church. The problem in the view of the Holland regents, however, was first that the [...] "wrong" [...] sequence was observed: the States General were given precedence over the provincial states, and secondly that prayers were also said for that [...] "private citizen", the Prince of Orange. The States therefore now prescribed that prayers for the States General should be <b>said</b> <b>last,</b> and those for the States of Holland first, and that the Prince of Orange (13 years at the time) should be omitted. Though this formulary only applied to the province of Holland, and the clergy (mindful of their livings) complied with discreetly gnashing teeth, the other provinces erupted in a furore. The States of Friesland took this opportunity to challenge the doctrine of provincial sovereignty head-on, and claimed that the formulary went contrary to the Acts of the Dort Synod, that had settled the church in 1619. Zeeland almost supported Friesland, but De Witt managed to get the Zeeland States (who always had to mind their volatile Calvinist base) to prevaricate.|$|E

Players can choose to download an expansion pack dubbed Pinball FX 2 Core which unlocks four tables: BioLab, Pasha, Rome, and Secrets of the Deep. [...] Additional tables can be purchased individually, or via compilations. [...] The first compilation, titled Pinball FX Classic, contains four tables from the original Pinball FX. As the original Pinball FX was delisted from Xbox Live Marketplace, people who purchased Pinball FX receive the Classic collection, {{as well as other}} tables they purchased for that title, for free. The second compilation, Marvel Pinball, has four pinball tables based on major Marvel Comics characters: Blade, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Wolverine. [...] Achievements are based on the table rather than the game, allowing Pinball FX 2 to have a record 2050 gamerscore and 97 achievements on Xbox Live Arcade. Each table can also be tweaked and configured via the game's Operators menu. This allows players to adjust where certain parts of the table are located and how many points unlock special sections and features of the table. On April 20, 2011, the Mars table was released. Themed around the planet of the same name, it is the first new individual table since the release of Pinball FX 2. On August 31, 2011, Pinball FX 2 received its first original individual table with the release of Ms. Splosion Man, a table based on the Xbox Live Arcade platformer of the same name developed by Twisted Pixel Games. From October 26 to November 2, 2011, the full version of the Paranormal table was given away for free as a gift to the game's fans. On September 4, 2012, a table based on the popular PopCap Games title Plants vs. Zombies was released for both Pinball FX 2 and the newly released Zen Pinball 2 for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. On December 12, 2012, four tables from Zen Pinball were released for Pinball FX 2, leaving only one PlayStation 3-exclusive table from the original Zen Pinball remaining on that platform. <b>Said</b> <b>last</b> table, a table based on Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, was finally released on the Xbox One version on December 4, 2014, thus removing all table exclusivity for Zen Pinball.|$|E
