A specimen is placed in a <b>shear</b> <b>box</b> which has two stacked rings to hold the sample; the contact between the two rings is at approximately the mid-height of the sample. A confining stress is applied vertically to the specimen, and the upper ring is pulled laterally until the sample fails, or through a specified strain. The load applied and the strain induced is recorded at frequent intervals to determine a stress-strain curve for each confining stress. Several specimens are tested at varying confining stresses to determine the shear strength parameters, the soil cohesion (c) and the angle of internal friction, commonly known as friction angle (...) [...] The results of the tests on each specimen are plotted on a graph with the peak (or residual) stress on the y-axis and the confining stress on the x-axis. The y-intercept of the curve which fits the test results is the cohesion, and {{the slope of the}} line or curve is the friction angle.|$|E

50|$|These {{are used}} when {{laboratory}} testing {{is not enough}} to determine the required properties of the ground. Laboratory samples are at times not considered to be representative and of insufficient quality, stress, pore pressure, and degree of saturation. Discontinuities in the ground can also warrant filed tests. Sample sizes depend on ground nature and test type. Boreholes are commonly used. The SPT is a simple and inexpensive test which can furnish a piling contractor with useful information. The van test is used to determine the shear strength of a soil - material with coarse silt or sand can mean unreliable results. Permeability is found by determining whether the relevant aquifer is confined on unconfined with cognizance of the normal fluctuations in the aquifer. Installation of the borehole itself may influence stresses. For a reliable test this should be followed by a pumping test. Packer tests are also used to measure the impermeability of grouted ground and permeability of dam foundations, strength and deformation data can also be taken. There are many types, mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic, the latter being the most popular. A clean borehole with a properly seated packer is essential (cement mortar is sometime used). Geophysical logs from the boreholes used can be taken at the same time enhancing the value of the results. Pressuremeter tests are used to stress, stiffness and strength of the ground to be investigated. It can be used in most ground types. There are three main types - pre-bored, self bored and pushed in. Boring should do minimal damage to the ground as much as possible. an unload reload method of around three times is used to give an accurate value of stiffness. Probing from the surface is done using a steel rod. Mainly used at a preliminary stage, it is also useful to check surrounding ground but is unsuitable in soils with boulders and cobbles. Static probing is mostly conducted with the use of electric sensors. It is quick and cheap. Pumping allows the determination of groundwater conditions using pumping and observation wells. Data interpretation can be complicated and is classed in steady and non-steady states. Density testing is conducted using the average of three results to obtain a significant result. The use of the sand replacement and core cutter test are common and the use of water replacement, rubber balloon, and nuclear methods are also used.In-situ testing data is important to design of works. Stress measurement in rocks and soils can be determined. Bearing tests are used to determine the shear strength and deformation characteristics of a soil. In-situ shear testing is done using a system similar to the laboratory <b>shear</b> <b>box</b> test. Large scale testing should be assessed on a case by case basis. Slope failure or settlement of a structure after field tests have been conducted are examples of phenomena which may be considered as back analysis, this be conducted successfully when accompanied by a full investigation to determine the ground and ground water conditions. Geophysical surveying can be useful in site investigation for determining layers of rock other geological features, locating aquifers, mineral deposits, voids - natural or man-made and engineering properties of the ground. Electrical resistivity and seismic methods amongst others are used. This is a specialized field. The geophysical adviser should be involved at all stages. Experience has shown care should be taken when writing the specification for this type of work amongst other factors.|$|E

40|$|We present here both {{analytical}} and numerical results of hydrodynamic stability investigations of rotationally supported circumstellar flows using the <b>shearing</b> <b>box</b> formalism. Asymptotic scaling arguments justifying the <b>shearing</b> <b>box</b> approximation are systematically derived, showing that there exist two limits {{which we call}} small <b>shearing</b> <b>box</b> (SSB) and large <b>shearing</b> <b>box</b> (LSB). The physical meaning of these two limits {{and their relationship to}} model equations implemented by previous investigators are discussed briefly. Two dimensional (2 D) dynamics of the SSB are explored and shown to contain transiently growing (TG) linear modes, whose nature is first discussed within the context of linear theory. The fully nonlinear regime in 2 D is investigated numerically for very high Reynolds (Re) numbers. Solutions exhibiting sustained dynamics are found and manifest episodic but recurrent TG behavior and these are associated with the formation and long-term survival of coherent vortices. The life-time of this spatio-temporal complexity depends on the Re number and the strength and nature of the initial disturbance. We show results for a case in which the dynamical activity persists for the entire duration of the simulation (hundreds of box orbits). Some combinations of the Re number and the initial perturbation spectrum (and strength) show the transiently growing phenomenon to ultimately fade away or, in some instances, to be absent altogether. Because the SSB approximation used here is equivalent to a 2 D incompressible flow, the dynamics can not depend on the Coriolis force. Therefore, three dimensional (3 D) simulations are needed in order to decide if this force indeed suppresses nonlinear hydrodynamical instability in rotationally supported disks in the <b>shearing</b> <b>box.</b> Comment: Submitted to A+A on April 1, 2004, Accepted August 3, 200...|$|R

40|$|Barotropic fluids, {{for which}} the {{pressure}} is only {{a function of the}} density, rotate on cylinders {{in the presence of a}} gravitational potential, so that the angular frequency of such a disk is independent of height. Therefore the <b>shearing</b> <b>box</b> framework, representing a small disk volume with height-independent angular frequency, can con-sistently model barotropic disks. If the fluid in the disk is baroclinic, the angular frequency does in general de-pend on height and it is thus necessary to go beyond the standard <b>shearing</b> <b>box</b> approach. In this paper, we show that given a global disk model, it is possible to develop consistent models that are local in horizontal planes and global in height with shearing-periodic boundary conditions. These models can be non-axisymmetric for glob-ally barotropic disks but should be axisymmetric for globally baroclinic disks. We provide explicit equations for this vertically global <b>shearing</b> <b>box</b> which can be implemented in standard magnetohydrodynamic codes by generalizing the shearing-periodic boundary conditions to allow for a height-dependent angular frequency.

In order to achieve the objective of this research, direct simple shear (DSS) and direct <b>shear</b> <b>box</b> (DSB) tests were selected. The simple shear test distributes all stress-strain through entire the soil specimen. It was compared with direct <b>shear</b> <b>box</b> test based on the stress-strain relationship. This research is to investigate the stress-strain between direct shear test and direct simple shear test based on peat samples of hemic and amorphous. This method covers the determination of the stress-strain relationship and strength of a specimen to investigate the behaviour of peat. Index properties test of hemic and amorphous are based on the moisture content, organic content, liquid limit, fibre content and specific gravity. Normal stresses that has been used were 12. 5 kPa, 25 kPa, 50 kPa and 100 kPa with constant shear rate of 0. 1 mm/min. Direct <b>shear</b> <b>box</b> has the higher value of strength and continuously increasing without showing any failure on peat while direct simple shear shows the peak value of stress-strain until the specimen is failed. Direct <b>shear</b> <b>box</b> is simple and straight forward method compared with the direct simple shear that acted as real condition. Direct simple shear (DSS) sheared diagonally at every layer of the specimen and direct <b>shear</b> <b>box</b> (DSB) only sheared horizontally {{at the center of the}} specimen. Result findings contribute and establish the shear stress-strain behaviour of tested peat between DSS and DSB. The research shows that direct simple shear test is more suitable to determine the stress-strain-strength behaviour of peat. Direct <b>shear</b> <b>box</b> consistenly gave higher shear strength of peat than direct simple shear. This is due to the shearing orientation during shearing process. The stress-strain relationship on peat soil using direct simple shear test shows the peak value of stress-strain behaviour on peat but direct <b>shear</b> <b>box</b> test didn't show any peak value and increased continuously.

Over a range of values of the shearing rate S spanning approximately two orders of magnitude, the growth rate of the magnetic field is proportional to the imposed shear, γ∝ S, while the characteristic spatial scale of the field is ∝ S^- 1 / 2. The effect is quite general: earlier results for the nonrotating case by Yousef et al. (2008) are extended to <b>shearing</b> <b>boxes</b> with Keplerian rotation; it is also shown that the shear dynamo mechanism operates both below and above the threshold for the fluctuation dynamo. The apparently generic nature of the shear dynamo effect makes it an attractive object of study for the purpose of understanding the generation of magnetic fields in astrophysical systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of planetesimals and planetary cores may be {{strongly influenced by}} density perturbations driven by magneto-rotational turbulence in their natal protoplanetary gas disks. Using the local <b>shearing</b> <b>box</b> approximation, we perform numerical simulations of planetesimals moving as massless particles in a turbulent, magnetized, unstratified gas disk. Our fiducial disk model shows turbulent accretion characterized by a Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter of α∼ 10 ^- 2, with root-mean-square density perturbations of ∼ 10...|$|R
40|$|We apply a new, second-order Godunov code, Athena, {{to studies}} of the magnetorotational {{instability}} using the local <b>shearing</b> <b>box</b> formalism. We present a set of ideal magnetohydrodynamic, unstratified <b>shearing</b> <b>box</b> simulations using two initial magnetic field configurations: a net uniform vertical field, and a sinusoidally varying zero-net vertical field. These simulations provide a comparison with results from earlier studies that used different numerical algorithms. We find that our simulations agree well with previously published results, including the decreasing turbulent energy {{as a function of}} resolution in the zero-net field model. We next carry out analyses to study the flow of energy from differential rotation to turbulent fluctuations to thermalization. The first analysis is based on a direct measurement of the time-evolution of volume-averaged quantities, including the correlation in time between the rates of change of different energy components. We find that the timescale over which energy is injected into turbulent fluctuations and then dissipated is on the order of Ω − 1, where Ω is the orbital frequency of the local domain. Magnetic dissipation dominates over kinetic dissipation, although not by as great a factor as the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy. The second analysis examines the magnetic and kinetic energy evolution equations in Fourier space, using the assumption that the time-averaged energies are constant. From this, we characterize the numerical dissipation as a function of length scale and model it as effective resistive and viscous losses. We find the numerical resistivity and viscosity are a function of resolution, but the effective magnetic Prandtl number is ∼ 2, independent of resolution or initial field geometry. These results will serve as a baseline for future <b>shearing</b> <b>box</b> studies where dissipation is controlled by the inclusion of explicit viscosity and resistivity.
