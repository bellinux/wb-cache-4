40|$|Based on {{the account}} of the vital role which the {{national}} finance played in supporting agriculture, the thesis presents the current situation of financial support for agriculture in China, in terms of the limited scale and irrational structure of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture. On the basis of the brief introduction of the current level of Chinese farmers’ income, the thesis discusses the effects of scale and irrational structure of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture on the farmers’ income, according to the related data of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture and rural per capita net income. The results indicate that the calculating regression equation has a remarkable explanation power, reflecting the positive role of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture played by national finance in increasing the farmers’ income. As regards the structure of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture at present, according to the proportion from high to low, the expenditure primarily consists of three parts from high to low in sequence as follows: productive expenditure and funds for public undertakings, capital construction expenditure, and rural relief expenditure plus science and technology funds. Such sequence deviates from the marginal production effects of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture and the correlation of farmers’ income, which demonstrates the severe irrationality of the structure of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture. Corresponding countermeasures are put forward as follows: on one hand, we should continue intensifying the efforts to support agriculture financially in order to form a regular increase mechanism; on the other hand, we should adjust and optimize the structure of financial <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> in agriculture, and further crystallize the investment flows.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is two-fold; first, it studies the impact of the {{credibility}} of fiscal rule policy on the stability of output growth; second, it compares the effectiveness of fiscal rule policy to discretionary and automatic stabilizer fiscal policies to address the fluctuation of output growth. Employing quarterly data over the period 2001 - 2013 in the case of Indonesia, we obtain that the credible debt rule leads to a decrease in the volatility of output growth while the non-credible deficit rule does not have any effect. Both unsystematic and systematic components of discretionary fiscal policy have a stabilizing function. Interestingly, the automatic stabilization tends to induce the volatility of output growth. Given those results, we infer that government spending is not a good automatic stabilizer. It seems that the lower ratio of government expenditure to GDP along with improving credibility of deficit rule policy has a smoother effect on the economy.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between institutional characteristics (institutional selectivity, faculty and financial characteristics) and retention and 6 -year graduation rates at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Institutional financial characteristics (instructional, academic support, student services and institutional <b>support</b> <b>expenditures)</b> were examined from two perspectives: (1) The relationship {{between the amount of}} money spent per student and retention and graduation rates and (2) The relationship between the percentage of institutional expenditures and retention and graduation rates. I estimate 6 -year graduation rates and 1 -year retention rates in 2009 for HBCUs in the sample using multiple linear-regression. This study has two research questions: 1. 	Do institutional selectivity, faculty characteristics and financial characteristics spent per student significantly predict 6 -year graduation rates at HBCUs and UNCF institutions? 2. 	Do institutional selectivity, faculty characteristics and the percentage of expenditures significantly predict first year retention rates at HBCUs and UNCF institutions? Key Findings and Implications This paper found that there is a relationship between institutional selectivity, faculty and financial expenditures on graduation and retention rates. When 6 -year graduation rate was the variable of influence, percentage female, accreditation, open admission, and institutional <b>support</b> <b>expenditures</b> were found to be significant across both, the all HBCU and UNCF sets of data. In general there was a direct relationship between percentage female and graduation rates. This finding was consistent with much of the research on graduation rates that show that women graduate at higher rates than men. Institutional selectivity exerted a significant influence on graduation rates. Implications If improving retention and graduation rates is an institutional goal, then strategies to reduce institutional <b>support</b> <b>expenditures</b> and evaluate the percentage of staff dedicated to instruction is warranted. Similarly, the findings suggest directions for future research that may tease out some of the organizational, pedagogical and policy features of HBCUS. There are important contrasts between the retention model findings for all HBCUS and for UNCF institutions. These contrasts suggest that UNCF institutions have different dynamics than all HBCUs and retention level strategies that work for one might not work for the other. When regressed alone, the retention model for UNCF institutions revealed no significant results for the variables of interest. On the other hand, for all HBCUs, accreditation, selectivity and instructional staff percentage had consistent significant effects. Overall, institutional selectivity and institutional <b>support</b> <b>expenditures</b> appears to be an important determinant of graduation rates. Having an admissions policy (negative relationship) and accreditation recognized by the US Department of Education (positive relationship) significantly impacts 6 -year graduation rates. The open admissions policy is potentially a sensitive issue for HBCUs because of a tradition of providing educational access to disadvantaged populations. However, an increasingly competitive higher education arena, flanked with the possibility of state and federal aid tied to graduation outcomes, may necessitate a review of this policy and/or the institutional programs that support matriculating students entering under such a policy. Also, high expenditures in the institutional support category negatively impact graduation rates, suggesting that the current allocation of these overhead expenses deserves more scrutiny. The percentage of instructional staff has a significant influence on first year retention rates. In general, higher percentages of instructional staff negatively impacted retention rates. This finding is somewhat surprising as we might expect more staff dedicated to classroom instruction to {{have a positive effect on}} student outcomes. This finding warrants more research into the specific ways institutions assign instructional responsibilities to professors, especially those who teach first year students...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore the links that exist between the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Communities (EC) and the EC budget. In particular, the thesis {{examines}} {{the impact on the}} budget of reforming the CAP. It shows that the nature of support offered under the CAP up to the 1992 MacSharry reforms has a strong historical precedent in French and German history. It then goes on to examine in greater detail the support mechanisms of the cereals and oilseeds sectors. The cereals sector is focused on because of its importance in agricultural output and in total agricultural <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> by the EC. Oilseeds is considered for its policy linkages with cereals in both production and consumption. The detailed nature of expenditures on these sectors is examined in detail, with particular emphasis placed on costs and policy problems arising out of intervention storage. In forecasting future expenditures under different policy scenarios, cereals production and consumption are considered separately. Imports, exports and intervention behaviour are also considered, to permit the examination of all aspects of the cereals market that affect expenditure. The impact of the 1992 MacSharry reforms is compared to a strict continuation of the 1988 stabiliser reforms and a price freeze at 1992 levels for the forecast period to 1999. It is shown that the impact of the 1992 reforms is to reduce the extent of the market imbalances by 1999 as compared with the base scenarios, but unless the level of compensatory payment is cut, then by 1999, the EC faces a support bill that is higher under the new policy than would have been the case had the 1988 reforms been retained...|$|E

The mean survey cost was $ 13, 113 per district [median: $ 11, 675; IQR = $ 8, 365 -$ 14, 618], $ 17, 566 per evaluation unit [median: $ 15, 839; IQR = $ 10, 773 -$ 19, 915], $ 692 per cluster [median: $ 625; IQR = $ 452 -$ 847] and $ 6. 0 per person screened [median: $ 4. 9; IQR = $ 3. 7 -$ 7. 9]. Survey unit costs varied substantially across settings, and were driven by parameters such as geographic location, demographic characteristics, seasonal effects, and local operational constraints. Analysis by activities showed that fieldwork constituted the largest share of in-country survey costs (74 %), followed by training of survey teams (11 %). The main drivers of in-country survey costs were personnel (49 %) and transportation (44 %). Global <b>support</b> <b>expenditure</b> for all surveyed districts amounted to $ 5. 1 m, which included grant management, epidemiological support, and data stewardship. This study provides the most extensive analysis of the cost of conducting trachoma prevalence surveys to date. The findings can aid planning and budgeting for future trachoma surveys required to measure the impact of trachoma elimination activities. Furthermore, {{the results of this study}} can also be used as a cost basis for other disease mapping programmes, where disease or context-specific survey cost data are not available...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} fiscal policy and fiscal institutions in managing scaled-up aid. In an environment of volatile scaled-up aid, fiscal policy formulation should be anchored in medium-term frameworks, incorporating a longer-term view of potential resource availability and spending plans. There is merit in smoothing expenditures over time so that all programs are adequately funded. The paper argues that wage-bill ceilings {{should be used in}} Fund-supported programs only in exceptional cases. The paper also discusses basic reforms for strengthening public financial management systems for effective utilization of scaled-up aid flows.

In contrast, at the higher prices forecast for the three crops over the 2009 – 2012 crop years, spending per acre {{is expected to be}} higher for acres enrolled in the ACRE program than for acres enrolled in the traditional programs. These results reflect the different design features of the two programs: revenue versus price assistance and assistance levels that adjust with lagged market revenue versus fixed nominal support triggers.

40|$|While {{decreasing}} inequality {{is generally}} considered desirable, {{and there is a}} growing understanding of which policies do and do not promote equality, much less is known regarding why these policies are adopted to varying degrees of intensity in different times and places. To explain this variation, the constituencies for different policies under various conditions must be identified. This paper explores that question using Brazilian public opinion data on preferences regarding taxation, conditional cash transfers, pension schemes and educations. It is found that disagreement across socio-economic groups arises on how government should address inequality rather than whether it should do so. While poorer respondents support cash transfers more than the rich, the rich are more likely than the poor to <b>support</b> <b>expenditures</b> on public education. Contrary to what is commonly assumed, inequality seems to breed altruism among the rich regarding the quintessential poverty reduction scheme of conditional cash transfers. ...|$|R
