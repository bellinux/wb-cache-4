40|$|Solar {{power is}} an {{alternative}} energy resource which will potentially reduce the dependence on environmental energy resources such as coal and petroleum. However, the solar power absorption efficiency in current <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>panel</b> systems is normally lower that limits the solar system applications. The solar power system needs to be improved including solar panel tracking mechanism to increase the system energy efficiency. To receive the maximum solar energy from sunlight, the tracking mechanism is required in order for solar power system to follow sun’s daily and yearly movement. The solar panel system should {{have the capability to}} store solar energy while work in rainy, windy, and snowy conditions. Also, the solar power system should be able to withstand the external loads, such as strong wind and heavy snow, to function properly even in severe weather and harsh environment.

50|$|Initial {{designs for}} a GREEN cell {{proposed}} that each GREEN Cell opens two doors length-wise, thus covering neighboring containers as well.

40|$|Consumer {{adoption}} of renewable energies {{is an important}} step towards less carbon-intensive and more sustainable energy systems. But despite growing ecological awareness and articulated preferences for green products, renewable energies face slow rates of diffusion in consumer markets. This has been hard to explain given consumers’ favorability to the concept of products that lower one’s impact on the natural environment. This study uses data from 254 homeowners in Ireland to investigate the psychological process of adopting a renewable <b>energy</b> system – <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>panels.</b> Applying Behavioral Reasoning Theory (BRT), this research examines a proposed model in which reasons both for and against adopting solar panels mediate the relationship between consumers’ attitudes, values and adoption intentions. Results suggest the model is generally supported with both reasons for adoption and reasons against adoption having countervailing influences in the psychological processing of adoption intentions. These findings suggest that researchers and marketers should include mediating constructs, such as (i) reasons for adoption, (ii) reasons against adoption, and (iii) attitudes toward a technology when attempting to explain how consumers think about the {{adoption of}} renewable energy systems...|$|R
