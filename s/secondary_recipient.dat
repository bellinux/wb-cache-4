Using an in vivo depletion approach, we recently demonstrated that CD 4 �, but not CD 8 �, T cells participated in inducing SGVHD. Studies were therefore undertaken to adoptively transfer SGVHD into lethally irradiated, syngeneic BM reconstituted <b>secondary</b> <b>recipients.</b> Whole T cell populations as well as purified CD 4 � T cells isolated from SGVHD, but not normal or transplant control, animals mediated the transfer of SGVHD into <b>secondary</b> <b>recipients.</b> These cells have an apparent specificity for enteric bacterial antigens. The pathologic process that developed was identical to that observed in the animals with de novo SGVHD after syngeneic BMT and CsA therapy. It was shown that a radiationsensitive mechanism prevented the transfer of SGVHD into normal, nonirradiated <b>secondary</b> <b>recipients.</b> The ability to reproducibly transfer SGVHD into <b>secondary</b> <b>recipients</b> will enhance our ability to study regulatory mechanisms that are altered during CsA therapy and permit the developmen...|$|R
40|$|The human/sheep {{xenograft}} {{model has}} proven valuable {{in assessing the}} in vivo hematopoietic activity of stem cells {{from a variety of}} fetal and postnatal human sources. CD 34 +/lineage- or CD 34 +/CD 38 - cells isolated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiated on S 17 feeder layer were transplanted by intraperitoneal injections into fetal sheep. Chimerism in primary transplants was established with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flow cytometry of bone marrow and peripheral blood samples.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of BM hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) adhesion, engraftment, and mobilization remain incompletely identified.

Loss or inhibition of (M) uPAR increased HSPC proliferation and impaired their homing, engraftment, and adhesion to the BM microenvironment. During mobilization, (M) uPAR was inactivated by plasmin via proteolytic cleavage. Cell-autonomous loss of the gene encoding (M) uPAR also impaired long-term engraftment and multilineage repopulation in primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>recipient</b> mice.

Lineage-negative (Lin−) /CD 71 − cells among bone marrow cells (BMCs) from C 57 BL/ 6 Ly 5. 1 mice were separated into major histocompatibility complex class Ihigh (class Ihigh) /c-kitlow and class Ihigh/c-kit<low populations.

40|$|Multiple genetic hits are {{detected}} {{in patients with}} acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To investigate this further, we developed a tetracycline-inducible mouse model of AML, in which the initial transforming event, overexpression of HOXA 10, can be eliminated. Continuous overexpression of HOXA 10 is required to generate AML in primary recipient mice, but is not essential for maintenance of the leukemia. Transplantation of AML to <b>secondary</b> <b>recipients</b> showed that in established leukemias, ∼ 80 % of the leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) in bone marrow stopped proliferating upon withdrawal of HOXA 10 overexpression. However, the population of LICs in primary recipients is heterogeneous, as ∼ 20 % of the LICs induce leukemia in <b>secondary</b> <b>recipients</b> despite elimination of HOXA 10 -induced overexpression. Intrinsic genetic activation of several proto-oncogenes was observed in leukemic cells resistant to inactivation of the initial transformation event. Interestingly, high levels of the adhesion molecule CD 44 on leukemic cells are essential to generate leukemia after removal of the primary event. This suggests that extrinsic niche-dependent factors are also involved in the host-dependent outgrowth of leukemias after withdrawal of HOXA 10 overexpression event that initiates the leukemia.

40|$|When {{appropriate}} {{doses of}} viable bone marrow cells (104 - 105) are injected into lethally irradiated mice, distinct nodules {{appear in the}} spleen of the recipient, representing foei of donor cell hemopoietic proliferation (1). Evidence based upon marker chromosome distribution indicates that each such nodule of developing hemopoietic cells (spleen colony) is donal in origin, i. e., it is the progeny of one cell designated as a "colony forming unit " (CFU) (2). The CFU {{may or may not}} always represent a true stem cell. In their earlier stages of development (up to 7 or 8 days), most spleen colonies are of either erythropoietic or granulopoietic nature, not both. Soon after this period, however, nearly all colonies contain cells of both the erythropoietic and granulopoietic series (3, 4). Transfusion of cells from an erythropoietic colony into a newly irradiated recipient gives rise to both erythropoietic and granulopoietic spleen colonies.

The purpose of the experiments described here was to test the "homing" capacity of T cells by a method that did not involve radioactive labeling. It has been shown elsewhere that some or all mouse T cells are stimulated to divide in culture by the mitogens phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A) (2). We therefore elected to inject karyotypically distinct lymphocytes into syngeneic recipients and to follow their subsequent distribution by culture of lymph node and spleen cells of the recipient with PHA or Con A.

Despite the inclusion of these elements, the efficacy of these vectors may be limited by transgene silencing due to the genomic environment surrounding the integration site. Barrier insulators can be used to give more consistent expression and resist silencing even with lower vector copies. Here, the barrier activity of an insulator element from the human ankyrin- 1 gene was analyzed in a lentiviral vector carrying an antisickling human Î²-globin gene. Inclusion of a single copy of the Ankyrin insulator did not affect viral titer, and improved the consistency of expression from the vector in murine erythroleukemia cells. The presence of the Ankyrin insulator element did not change transgene expression in human hematopoietic cells in short-term erythroid culture or in vivo in primary murine transplants. However, analysis in <b>secondary</b> <b>recipients</b> showed that the lentiviral vector with the Ankyrin element preserved transgene expression, whereas expression from the vector lacking the Ankyrin insulator decreased in <b>secondary</b> <b>recipients.</b> These studies demonstrate that the Ankyrin insulator may improve long-term Î²-globin expression in hematopoietic stem cells for gene therapy of hemoglobinopathies...|$|R

High-efficiency transduction of human cord blood CD 34 (+) cells was achieved after overnight incubation with vector particles. Sixteen to 28 percent of individual colony-forming units granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) colonies derived from cord blood CD 34 (+) cells were positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the GFP gene. The transduction efficiency of SCID-repopulating cells (SRC) within the cord blood CD 34 (+) population was assessed by serial transplantation into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. When 400, 000 cord blood CD 34 (+) cells were transplanted into primary recipients, all primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>recipients</b> contained and expressed the transgene.

TRF 2 and a GFP-TRF 2 fusion protein were introduced into hematopoietic precursors, and tested for function.

40|$|The {{regulatory}} mechanisms {{governing the}} cell cycle progression of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are well characterized, but {{those responsible for}} the return of proliferating HSCs to a quiescent state remain largely unknown. Here, we present evidence that CD 81, a tetraspanin molecule acutely responsive to proliferative stress, is essential for the maintenance of long-term repopulating HSCs. Cd 81 (-/-) HSCs showed a marked engraftment defect when transplanted into <b>secondary</b> <b>recipient</b> mice and a significantly delayed return to quiescence when stimulated to proliferate with 5 -fluorouracil (5 FU). In addition, we found that CD 81 proteins form a polarized patch when HSCs are returning to quiescence. Thus, we propose that the spatial distribution of CD 81 during the HSC recovery phase drives proliferative HSC to quiescence, and is important to preserve the self-renewal properties. Here, we show that lack of CD 81 leads to loss of HSC self-renewal, and the clustering of CD 81 on HSC membrane results in deactivation of Akt, which subsequently leads to nuclear translocation of FoxO 1 a. Thus, CD 81 functions as part of a previously undefined mechanism that prohibits excessive proliferation of HSCs exposed to environmental stress...|$|E

In this study, mouse bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells were subdivided into Rh- 123 lo, Rh- 123 med, and Rh- 123 hi populations. The Rh- 123 lo (resting) population was significantly enriched in cells with a higher proliferative potential compared to the Rh- 123 hi (activated) population. The resting population exhibited a 20 -fold greater ability to differentiate into splenic colony-forming units (CFU-S) relative to the activated population, whereas the activated population contained about 4 -fold more day 13 CFU-S on primary transfer relative to the resting population. The two populations produced morphologically distinct splenic colonies; however, the frequency and morphology of in vitro colonies were very similar. Only the resting population provided sufficient stem cells to transfer long-term hematopoietic repopulation to <b>secondary</b> <b>recipient</b> animals after lethal irradiation. On a single cell level, the resting and activated populations exhibited an equivalent ability to differentiate into lymphoid and myeloid progeny.

Although most mice remained healthy, one mouse developed splenomegaly and polycythemia at 67 days; the virus from this mouse reproducibly caused the same symptoms in <b>secondary</b> <b>recipients</b> by 2 to 3 weeks postinfection. This disease, which was characterized by extramedullary erythropoietin-independent erythropoiesis in the spleens and livers, was also reproduced in long-term bone marrow cultures.

During further in vivo passaging, a virus that encodes an Mr- 55, 000 glycoprotein became predominant. Sequence analysis indicated that the ultimate virus is a new SFFV that encodes a glycoprotein of 410 amino acids with the hallmark features of classical gp 55 s.

40|$|DTH to {{allogeneic}} histocompatibility antigens is a T cell dependent reaction, {{which can}} be induced in immunologically competent individuals by subcutaneous (s. c.) or intravenous (i. v.) administration of alloantigens (Vander Kwast and Benner, 1978; Bianchi et al., 1984). After immunization, activated antigen-specific T cells and, possibly, T cell derived factors circulate through the body and mediate an effective immune-surveillance. After reencounter with the specific antigen, for example after injection of the relevant allogeneic spleen cells into a hind foot, these T cells or their factors cause the release of vasoactive substances, which lead to the accumulation of granulocytes, mononuclear cells and edemic fluid. This inflammatory response appears as a swelling of the site of reencounter of the antigen, which is maximal between 24 and 96 hours after antigen administration. The delayed onset distinguishes DTH from the more immediate types of hypersensitivity. DTH can also be induced in immunologically incompetent individuals, by the infusion of allogeneic, immunocompetent T cells. This leads {{to a state of}} DTH directed to the host histocompatibility antigens (Wolters and Benner, 1978).

In a murine retroviral bone marrow transduction-transplantation model, a Tel (exon 1 - 5) -Abl fusion protein induced 2 distinct illnesses: a CML-like myeloproliferative disease {{very similar to that}} induced by Bcr-Abl but with increased latency and a novel syndrome characterized by small-bowel myeloid cell infiltration and necrosis, increased circulating endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels, and fulminant hepatic and renal failure. Induction of both diseases required the Tel pointed homology oligomerization domain and Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Myeloid cells from mice with both diseases expressed Tel-Abl protein. CML-like disease induced by Tel-Abl and Bcr-Abl was polyclonal and originated from cells with multilineage (myeloid, erythroid, and B- and T-lymphoid) repopulating ability and the capacity to generate day- 12 spleen colonies in secondary transplantations.

Here we report that germ line mutation Ptpn 11 D 61 G in mice aberrantly accelerates hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) cycling, increases the stem cell pool, and elevates short-term and long-term repopulating capabilities, leading {{to the development of}} MPD. MPD is reproduced in primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>recipient</b> mice transplanted with Ptpn 11 D 61 G/+ whole bone marrow cells or purified Lineage−Sca- 1 +c-Kit+ cells, but not lineage committed progenitors. The deleterious effects of Ptpn 11 D 61 G mutation on HSCs are attributable to enhancing cytokine/growth factor signaling. The aberrant HSC activities caused by Ptpn 11 D 61 G mutation are largely corrected by deletion of Gab 2, a prominent interacting protein and target of Shp- 2 in cell signaling. As a result, MPD phenotypes are markedly ameliorated in Ptpn 11 D 61 G/+/Gab 2 −/− double mutant mice. Collectively, our data suggest that oncogenic Ptpn 11 induces MPD by aberrant activation of HSCs. This study also identifies Gab 2 as an important mediator for the pathogenic effects of Ptpn 11 mutations...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} transplanted marrow-thymus cell {{mixtures}} to generate antibody-forming cells in irradiated syngeneic or F 1 hybrid mice when immunized with sheep erythrocytes 18 hours later was determined. Much fewer anti-sheep plaque-forming cells (PFC) were detected in spleens of F 1 hybrid mice. Adrenalectomy, use of infant recipient mice, or preimmunization of donors or hosts {{did not prevent}} the suppression; the grafting of irradiated donor-type spleen cells (source of “accessory” cells) produced only an additive effect. Parental marrow and thymus cells were able to generate new precursors of PFC and specific inducer cells, respectively, in spleens of F 1 hybrid mice, as detected by two-step experiments utilizing parent-strain <b>secondary</b> <b>recipient</b> mice. The suppression depended upon transferring parental strain thymus cells into F 1 hybrid mice and was seen irrespective of the marrow donor strain. When irradiated mice were immunized twice (on the day of transplantation and 4 days later), there was only marginal suppression of antibody production when marrow cells only or marrow plus thymus cells were transplanted. Thus, it appears that an excess of thymus-derived “suppressor” cells is generated upon exposure to alloantigens and inhibit terminal differentiation of antibody-forming cells in a noncytotoxic manner. Mature PFC themselves were not the targets of suppression. The method of immunization probably determines the relative functional capacity of thymus-derived “helper” and suppressor cells...|$|E
40|$|Background: Patients with a {{diagnosis}} of schizophrenia are socially excluded. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate how patients participate in first encounters with unfamiliar healthy participants, who are unaware of their diagnosis. Methods: Patterns of participation were investigated during interactions involving three-people. Three conversation roles were analysed: (i) speaker, (ii) primary recipient- focus of the speaker’s attention and (iii) secondary recipient- unaddressed individual. Twenty patient interactions (1 patient, 2 healthy controls) and 20 control interactions (3 healthy participants) were recorded and motion captured in 3 D. The participation of patients and their partners, in each conversation role, was compared with controls at the start, middle and end of the interaction. The relationship between patients ’ participation, their symptoms and the rapport others experienced with them was also explored. Results: At the start of the interaction patients spoke less (ß= 2. 639, p =. 02) and spent more time as <b>secondary</b> <b>recipient</b> (ß =. 349, p =. 02). Patients ’ participation at the middle and end of the interaction did not differ from controls. Patients’ partners experienced poorer rapport with patients who spent more time as a primary recipient at the start of the interaction (Rho(11) = 2. 755, p,. 01). Patients ’ participation was not associated with symptoms. Conclusion: Despite their increased participation over time, patients ’ initial participation appears to be associated with others ’ experience of rapport with them. Thus, the opening moments of patients ’ first encounters appear to b...|$|E
40|$|An {{animal model}} for {{malignant}} mastocytosis {{is described in}} mice reconstituted with bone marrow cells expressing the verb 6 oncogene. The lethal mast cell disease is character-ized by massive infiltration of bone marrow, spleen, and several other visceral organs by connective tissue mast cells, which normally reside in the skin and the peritoneal cavity. As is frequently found in malignant mastocytosis, the verb& induced mast cell disease was accompanied in some primary recipients by an acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) that killed all <b>secondary</b> <b>recipients</b> {{regardless of whether the}} AML was already evident in the primary host. The infiltrating mast cells stained strongly positive with berberine sulfate, suggest-ing that they were terminally differentiated and in vitro they showed only a weak proliferative capacity. The leukemias were clonal but apparently of different origin than th...|$|R
40|$|In acute {{graft-versus-host disease}} (aGVHD), donor T cells attack the recipient's {{gastrointestinal}} tract, liver, and skin. We hypothesized that blocking access to distinct lymphoid priming sites may alter the specific organ tropism and prevent aGVHD development. In {{support of this}} initial hypothesis, we found that different secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) imprint distinct homing receptor phenotypes on evolving alloreactive effector T cells in vivo. Yet preventing T-cell entry to specific SLOs through blocking monoclonal antibodies, or SLO ablation, did not alter aGVHD pathophysiology. Moreover, transfer of alloreactive effector T cells into conditioned <b>secondary</b> <b>recipients</b> targeted the intestines and liver, irrespective of their initial priming site. Thus, we demonstrate redundancy of SLOs at different anatomical sites in aGVHD initiation. Only prevention of T-cell entry to all SLOs could completely abrogate the onset of aGVHD...|$|R
40|$|Previous studies (1) {{have shown}} that Fl rats (A/B) that recover from graftversus-host (GVH) 1 disease that was {{deliberately}} induced with parental (A) T cells become profoundly and specifically resistant to GVH disease, revealed by subsequent reinoculation of T cells from the same parental strain. Specific GVH resistance {{appears to be the}} outcome of an immune response mediated by host T cells with specificity directed against immunogenic idiotypic determinants (specificity-associated markers) of anti-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) receptors (anti-MHC b) present on the immunizing parental T cell population (2, 3). While it is known that GVH resistance is induced by immunization with parental T cells and that it is adoptively transferable to <b>secondary</b> Fa <b>recipients</b> with host T cells, it is not yet clear which T cell subpopulations are involved in these two events. We show here that the parental T cell subpopulation which induces GVH resistance resides solely in the W 3 / 25 + T helper (Th) subset that causes local GVH responses, i. e., enlarged popliteal lymph nodes, while host T cells of both the W 3 / 25 + Th and the OX 8 + T killer/suppressor (Tk/s) can adoptively transfer GVH resistance to <b>secondary</b> <b>recipients,</b> although Tk/s cells are more effective.
