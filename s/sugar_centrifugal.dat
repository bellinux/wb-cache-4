40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} proposing a {{solution}} to the rapid oscillation of the current which happened due to the cyclic operation of the batch <b>sugar</b> <b>centrifugal</b> machines. The current oscillation affects the stability of electrical generation produce by steam turbine alternators at Factory. The proposed solution focuses on sequencing these machines. Fuzzy logic control and Matlab Simulink are used to design a model of three batch sugar machines, the real time data is taken from Broadbent C 46 M batch centrifuge. Organizing the operation of these machines with sequence control is done by selecting the suitable delay time between machines. Two parameters in fuzzy logic control are used to obtain the desired delay time, the first parameter depends on the previous machine spinning time duration and the second depends on the time between the previous machine permission times to the current machine requesting permission from sequence control. When the default values of feed time, spin time & plough time are taken equal to (20 s, 40 s & 20 s) respectively to and be identical for three machines, the total current oscillation has been minimized to 43. 75 % (compared with peak oscillation of only one machine) and in repeated form, and the total current of the three machines is being less than the current of one machine. And in other cases when these parameters has different values the sequence control program also regulate the operation of the machines and the total current will not exceed the current taken by one machine...|$|E
40|$|During a {{nematode}} {{survey on}} cut {{flowers in the}} Pakdasht Region, Tehran Province, Iran, a species of foliar nematode belonging to the genus Aphelenchoides Fischer was detected in leaves of 10 - to 11 -month-old, greenhouse-grown (26 to 28 °C) chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflorum Kitam., cv. Puja) plants. Chrysanthemum leaves appeared discolored and slightly deformed. Diseased plants comprised approximately 40 % of all plants in the greenhouse and occurred in scattered clumps along irrigation paths. Spots and blackish brown, irregular, necrotic areas occupied 5 to 50 % of the leaf surface. Symptomatic tissue contained females, males, juveniles, and embryonated eggs of the nematode. All life stages of the nematode were detected in the mesophyll of younger and older infected leaves. The nematode population was extracted and quantified from symptomatic samples of 5 g of leaf tissues by modified Baermann funnel extraction and from 250 g of soil with a modification of the <b>sugar</b> <b>centrifugal</b> flotation method (1), counted, and identified. Morphological observations showed four incisures in the lateral field, excretory pore posterior to nerve ring, ovary single with oocytes in multiple rows, post-vulval uterine sac extending more than one-half of the vulva-anus distance, often containing sperm, tail elongate-conoid bearing a terminal peg with 2 to 4 minute processes. Males common (40 % of females) posteriorly curved through 180 ° upon relaxation, tail conoid bearing a terminal peg with 2 to 3 processes. Measurements of 14 females and 11 males (body length = 987 ± 48 μm, a = 49. 2 ± 4. 4, b = 12. 3 ± 1. 1, c = 20. 6 ± 2. 8, V = 71 ± 1. 7, T = 49 ± 2. 3, stylet length = 12. 6 ± 0. 6 μm, tail length = 47. 9 ± 5. 2 μm; position of vulva = 70. 8 ± 1. 7 %; spicules length = 22. 8 ± 1. 4 μm) conformed to {{the description of the}} chrysanthemum foliar nematode Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi (Schwartz) Steiner & Buhrer, (2).

40|$|Spiral {{nematodes}} (Helicotylenchus spp.) {{are common}} plant-parasitic nematodes in fields of many crops. In June 2015, two soil {{samples were collected}} from a soybean field in Richland County, ND. Nematodes were extracted from soil using the <b>sugar</b> <b>centrifugal</b> flotation method (Jenkins, 1964). Plant-parasitic nematodes were identified to genus based on morphological features and counted. Both samples contained spiral nematodes from 1, 500 to 3, 300 per kilogram of soil. In June and August 2016, 10 soil samples were collected from the same field. Nematodes were extracted, and nine of the samples had spiral nematodes ranging from 125 to 3, 065 per kilogram of soil. One soil sample with 1, 500 spiral nematodes per kilogram was used to inoculate two soybean cultivars Sheyenne and Barnes each in four replicates. After 15 wk of growth at 228 C in a greenhouse room, the population of spiral nematodes {{was found to have}} increased greatly. The final density was 9, 300 6 1, 701 spiral nematodes per kilogram of soil for Sheyenne and 9, 45162, 751 for Barnes. The reproductive factor in Sheyenne and Barnes was 6. 2 and 6. 3, respectively, indicating that this spiral nematode infects and reproduces well on these two soybean cultivars. Infected soybean roots had small brown lesions on the surface. Individual spiral nematodes were handpicked and examined morphologically and molecularly for species identification. Morphological measurements of adult females (n = 15) included body length (mean = 708. 5 mm, range = 600. 0 – 812. 0 mm), stylet (27. 6, 26. 0 – 29. 0), body width (28. 3, 25. 0 – 33. 0), lip region end to posterior end of pharyngeal glands (142. 5, 130. 0 – 152. 0), anal body width (15. 8, 14. 0 – 17. 5), tail length (20. 3, 15. 0 – 25. 0), tail annules (11. 6, 10. 0 – 14. 0), a (25. 0, 21. 4 – 27. 1), b (5. 0, 4. 4 – 5. 7), c (35. 4, 30. 2 – 41. 7), c 9 (1. 3, 1. 0 – 1. 6), and V (61. 8 %, 60. 0 – 63. 7). The spiral nematode was identified as Helicotylenchus microlobus according to morphological and morphometric characteristics (Subbotin et al., 2015). DNA was extracted from single nematodes (n = 8) using the Proteinase K method (Kumari and Subbotin, 2012). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified with the primers rDNA 2 /rDNA 1. 58 S (Cherry et al., 1997). The PCR products were then purified and sequenced. The consensus ITS rDNA sequence (accession no. KY 271078, 822 bp) that was deposited into the GenBank shared 99 % identity with two isolates of H. microlobus from California (KM 506860. 1 and KM 506859. 1) and one isolate of H. microlobus from Spain (KM 506862. 1) (Subbotin et al., 2015). It had only 91 % sequence identity with seven isolates of H. pseudorobustus (KM 506875. 1, KM 506880. 1, KM 506876. 1,KM 506874. 1, KM 506872. 1, KM 506879. 1, and KM 506878. 1) from California, Switzerland, and New Zealand, a spiral nematode species very closely related to H. microlobus in morphology. The molecular tests confirmed the identity of this spiral nematode as H. microlobus. The H. microlobus nematode was reported {{as one of the most}} commonly observed spiral nematodes in soil samples in the state of Minnesota, and all 13 soybean cultivars tested except Hawkeye were rated as hosts (Taylor, 1960).

40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} (H 2 O 2) {{has been}} tested {{in the past as}} a colour removal agent in the sugar refining process. The high costs and the very high reactivity of this chemical are negative factors that have prevented its full-scale application in sugar factories. Work was done in the USA to reduce the quantity of H 2 O 2 required by dosing as wash water in raw <b>sugar</b> <b>centrifugals.</b> Based on the promising results, trials were done in the Technology and Engineering Group of Tongaat Hulett laboratory on raw sugar and WSM sugar. Full-scale tests were carried out at the Huletts refinery (Hulref) centrifugals on the fourth white boiling at varying concentrations of between 30 - 1000 ppm on refined sugar in 2009 and 2010. The effect of H 2 O 2 on colour removal and on pH of both sugar and jet were investigated. Regardless of the H 2 O 2 concentration, 11 - 15 % colour removal in sugar was achieved, with insignificant reduction in pH. Contrary to sugar, jets showed an increasing trend in colour removal with an increase in H 2 O 2 concentration. The optimum H 2 O 2 application appears to be at a concentration of 300 ppm. The amount of H 2 O 2 consumed per ton of refined sugar produced shows that the use of this chemical may be an alternative for colour removal...|$|R

The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>sugar</b> flotation method recovered greater numbers of cysts when densities were near 400 cysts/ 100 cm³ soil and greater numbers of juveniles in all samples. The sugar flotation method recovered greater numbers of cysts during months when densities were less than 400 cysts/ 100 cm³ soil. Numbers of cysts and juveniles were lowest in June and July following land tillage in May.

40|$|In this {{research}} an extensive literature search into {{the mechanism of}} cavitation dynamics and its consequences was conducted. A cavitation venturie rig was designed and constructed, and the cavitation number was checked mathematically. A new camera technique was developed to capture the cavitation cloud. Carbon steel (AISI 1020), stainless steel (AISI 304 and 316), ferritic alloy steel (B 1274), brass (C 27000), phosphor bronze (C 51000) and aluminum bronze (C 60800) test pieces were prepared and tested in the venturie tube. Aluminum bronze was the most and carbon steel the least resistant of these alloys, the measured mechanical properties could not systematically be correlated with cavitation resistance. The microscopic examinations showed that cavitation induced plastic deformation had caused the misalignment of polishing lines. A field study into the susceptibility of an Iranian <b>sugar</b> cane company’s <b>centrifugal</b> pumps showed that deviation from the manuals hydraulic settings caused cavitation and that the gray cast iron had a poor resistance. Besides the venturie tube, other configurations were considered, of which an oil industry choke valve was constructed and examined for cavitation...|$|R
40|$|Background: In Canada, {{surveys of}} enteric parasites in {{dogs and cats}} have been {{reported}} sporadically over the past 40 years, mostly focusing on a specific region. The present work was performed to determine the current prevalence of various parasites in fecal samples from shelter dogs and cats across the Canadian provinces. Methods: A total of 1086 dog and 636 cat fecal samples from 26 shelters were analysed using a <b>sugar</b> solution double <b>centrifugal</b> flotation technique. Prevalences (national, regional, provincial, age and parasite-specific), were calculated and compared using the Fisher-Exact test. A multiplex PCR was performed to distinguish Taenia spp, Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis on samples positive for taeniid eggs. Results: Overall, 33. 9 % of dogs and 31. 8 % of cats were positive {{for at least one}} parasite. Toxocara canis and T. cati were the most prevalent parasite present in fecal samples followed by Cystoisospora spp. Prevalence in dogs was similar across the Atlantic, East, West and Pacific regions, while prevalence in cats varied regionally. Eggs of E. granulosus/E. canadensis were detected in samples from dogs from BC, AB, and ON. Conclusions: Data from this study will help in the development of strategies, based on the level of risk per geographic location for the prevention and response to these parasites in pets and free-roaming and shelter animals in Canada. </p...|$|R
40|$|The African region {{represents}} the weak {{point of the}} world economy. Many African countries have still not finished the process of transforming their economy. Agriculture represents only a minor portion of their economies’ performance – however {{it is still a}} key sector of the economy (especially considering the number of people working in agriculture or people representing the agricultural population). The agricultural sector in many sub-Saharan countries is extremely sensitive and its stability affects the stability of the whole region. A very good example representing sub-Saharan Africa is the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It is a country with a lot of potential, but it is classified among the poorest countries in the world. Its economy is extremely weak (despite its significant share in total GDP formation value), and underdeveloped. The share of agriculture in total GDP formation is over 42. 5 %. The number of people living in rural areas represents over 45 million {{out of a total of}} 75 million. The number of people working in agriculture is over 60 % of the total economically active population. The economy of the country is extremely poor and fragile, mainly because of political instability. The aim of this paper is firstly to specify the position of agriculture in the DRC economy, and also to specify the production and trade commodity structure in relation to other African countries. The paper’s ambition is to identify the most perspective commodities (groups of commodities), both for production and also for trade, and to recommend such a production and trade profile which would allow the DRC the possibility of improving its competitiveness - not only in relation to other African countries, but also in relation to the global market. The production and trade commodity structures are analysed through the application of the BCG method and competitiveness analysis. In relation to these objectives, the paper provides the following conclusions. The position of agriculture in the DRC economy is stable one. Furthermore, agriculture probably {{represents the}} most stable part of the DRC economy. According to the portfolio and competitiveness analyses, the most important commodity items for the DRC are the following: Rice paddy, Maize, and Cassava. The most competitive trade items are particularly Coffee, Tea, and Cocoa, and <b>Sugar</b> Raw <b>centrifugal.</b> The most notable weakness of DRC agriculture is the production of Wheat, Beverages, Poultry Meat, and Fixed Vegetable Oils...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolation}} of component sugars from biomass represents {{an important step}} in the bioprocessing of sustainable feedstocks such as <b>sugar</b> beet pulp. <b>Centrifugal</b> partition chromatography (CPC) is used here, as an alternative to multiple resin chromatography steps, to fractionate component monosaccharides from crude hydrolysed sugar beet pulp pectin. CPC separation of samples, prepared in the stationary phase, was carried out using an ethanol: ammonium sulphate (300 gL(- 1)) phase system (0. 8 : 1. 8 v:v) in ascending mode. This enabled removal of crude feedstream impurities and separation of monosaccharides into three fractions (l-rhamnose, l-arabinose and d-galactose, and d-galacturonic acid) in a single step. Throughput was improved three-fold by increasing sample injection volume, from 4 to 16 % of column volume, with similar separation performance maintained in all cases. Extrusion of the final galacturonic acid fraction increased the eluted solute concentration, reduced the total separation time by 24 % and removed the need for further column regeneration. Reproducibility of the separation after extrusion was validated by using multiple stacked injections. Scale-up was performed linearly from a semi-preparative 250 mL column to a preparative 950 mL column with a scale-up ratio of 3. 8 applied to mobile phase flow rate and sample injection volume. Throughputs of 9. 4 gL(- 1) h(- 1) of total dissolved solids were achieved at the preparative scale with a throughput of 1. 9 gL(- 1) h(- 1) of component monosaccharides. These results demonstrate the potential of CPC for both impurity removal and target fractionation within biorefinery separations...|$|R
40|$|Huletts Refinery (Hulref) {{normally}} boils two recovery massecuites, but can boil up {{to three}} recovery massecuites. Second crop runoff is a by-product that was previously sold for lysine manufacture to South African Bioproducts (SABP), a company which {{is no longer a}} regular customer. As a result, Hulref is using the Tongaat Hulett Sugar raw mills as an outlet for second crop runoff. This has put pressure on Hulref to optimise the recovery house pan floor operations to recover as much sugar as possible from the return syrup that enters the recovery house from the refinery. The colour of the remelted sugar stream from the recovery house back to the refinery is also a concern. The affinated sugar colours were much lower than those of the unaffinated sugar. This revealed that the bulk of the second crop sugar colour comes from the mother liquor film surrounding the crystal. Irregular crystal size is one of the contributors of poor purging of massecuite. Consequently, the colour of the sugar cured is high due to mother liquor adhering to the crystals. This highlighted the need to investigate the pan boiling practices at the recovery house. The number of cuts of the second crop boilings was reduced from three or more to two. Slurry graining was also introduced instead of the waiting method. Regular and larger crystals were obtained when slurry graining was adopted. This resulted in better purging of massecuite and consequently low second crop <b>sugar</b> colours. A <b>centrifugal</b> screen monitoring programme was instituted, which helped to quickly identify damaged screens for replacement. Water spray nozzles and a lube rod were installed in one of the machines. Low second crop syrup purities were achieved due to improved purging and effective use of centrifugal water...|$|R
