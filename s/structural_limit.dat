The Structural Analysis Group, which included Naval Ship Systems Command's Submarine Structures director Peter Palermo, plainly saw that the torpedo room was intact, {{though it had been}} pinched by excessive sea pressure. [...] The operations compartment collapsed at frame 33, this being the king frame of the hull, reaching its <b>structural</b> <b>limit</b> first. [...] The conical/cylindrical transition piece at frame 67 followed instantly. [...] The ship was broken in two by massive hydrostatic pressure at an estimated depth of [...] The operations compartment was largely obliterated by sea pressure, and the engine room had telescoped [...] forward into the hull due to collapse pressure, when the cone-to-cylinder transition junction failed between the auxiliary machine space and the engine room.|$|E

Additionally, the only <b>structural</b> <b>limits</b> the game checked on were the landing gear or direct impact, so for instance the flaps would not be damaged by lowering them at high speed.

40|$|The attentional blink (AB) is {{a widely}} studied deficit in {{reporting}} the second of two sequentially presented targets when they occur within 500 milliseconds. The AB often is interpreted to index a <b>structural</b> <b>limit</b> in sequential visual processing. However, this interpretation is challenged by reports that the deficit can be reduced with several hundred trials of specific training (Braun in Nature, 393 (6684), 424 – 425, 1998; Choi et al. in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 109 (30), 12242 – 12247, 2012; Taatgen et al. in Cognitive Psychology, 59 (1), 1 – 29, 2009) and other reports that some individuals experience very little or no deficit, even without specific training (Martens et al. in Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 18 (9), 1423 - 1438, 2006). Yet neither of these claims has been studied when the artifact of ceiling effects has been removed. We sent {{a small number of}} participants (n = 5) home to practice an AB task on their mobile phones for 3, 000 - 6, 000 trials (Experiment 1) and trained a much larger number of participants (n = 48) in a similar way for 1, 200 - 1, 800 trials (Experiment 2). Both experiments used adaptive procedures to equate task difficulty throughout training to keep second-target accuracy below ceiling levels. The results showed strong training effects on the rate of processing sequential information. Despite this, there were (a) robust AB effects after training for most participants, (b) no benefit for training on difficult versus easy target tasks, and (c) substantial correlations between the magnitude of the AB before and after extensive training. These findings support the interpretation that the AB is an index of a <b>structural</b> <b>limit</b> in the ability to consciously process rapid visual sequences. No Full Tex...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 117 - 120). An approach for evaluating reinforced concrete crographics. structural frame systems subjected to seismic forces under the framework of performance-based design methodology was developed. The method integrates the design criteria according to the proposed 1997 NEHRP Recommended Provisions for Seismic Regulation for New Buildings & Other Structures (BSSC 1997), <b>structural</b> <b>limit</b> states, pushover analyses, various seismic hazard levels, non-linear time history dynamic analyses and structural fragility curves. Three performance levels (or limit states) consisting of immediate occupancy, life safety, and collapse prevention according to FEMA- 273 (ATC 1997 a) were considered. Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to model the variability of strength and stiffness involved in estimating the <b>structural</b> <b>limit</b> state capacities. Three different hazard levels representing standard frequent event (50 % probability of exceedance in 50 years), design basis event (10 % probability of exceedance in 50 years) and maximum considered event (2 % probability of exceedance in 50 years) according to FEMA- 273 (ATC 1997 a) were used. The probabilistic nature of earthquakes was simulated by using 25 different records of measured time histories, from previous seismic events and scaled to various response spectra intensities (hazard levels). Inter-story was used as an indicative parameter for evaluating structural performance in form of structural fragility curves for the three limit states. The fragility curves developed in this study correlate the conditional probability of exceedance of the three structural performance limit states (BSSC 1997) to the three different seismic hazard levels prescribed by the FEMA- 273 (ATC 1997 a) and FEMA- 274 (ATC l 997 b). Structural fragility curves can be used for establishing design criteria for new buildings, for evaluating the extent of damage incurred by a building under seismic demands and for comparing the performance of various structural systems...|$|E

40|$|The J- 2 X is {{the upper}} stage engine {{currently}} being designed by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) for the Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV). Propellant supply {{requirements for the}} J- 2 X are defined by the Ares Upper Stage to J- 2 X Interface Control Document (ICD). Supply conditions outside ICD defined start or run boxes can induce turbopump cavitation leading to interruption of J- 2 X propellant flow during hot fire operation. In severe cases, cavitation can lead to uncontained engine failure {{with the potential to}} cause a vehicle catastrophic event. Turbopump and engine system performance models supported by system design information and test data are required to predict existence, severity, and consequences of a cavitation event. A cavitation model for each of the J- 2 X fuel and oxidizer turbopumps was developed using data from pump water flow test facilities at Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) and Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) together with data from Powerpack 1 A testing at Stennis Space Center (SSC) and from heritage systems. These component models were implemented within the PWR J- 2 X Real Time Model (RTM) to provide a foundation for predicting system level effects following turbopump cavitation. The RTM serves as a general failure simulation platform supporting estimation of J- 2 X redline system effectiveness. A study to compare cavitation induced conditions with component level <b>structural</b> <b>limit</b> thresholds throughout the engine was performed using the RTM. Results provided insight into system level turbopump cavitation effects and redline system effectiveness in preventing <b>structural</b> <b>limit</b> violations.
