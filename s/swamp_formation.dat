40|$|Geomorphology, geochronology and {{palynology}} {{are used}} to assess the development and stability of two channelled swamps on the Barrington Tops plateau. While both swamps commenced peat accumulation prior to about 4000 cal BP, new stratigraphic data indicate incision between 700 and 1000 cal BP, in response to regional climate change. Two broad stratigraphic units are identified in each swamp: the upper floodplain, comprised entirely of peat, and the inset floodplain, underlain by interbedded peat and fluvial sediments. Following incision, rapid vertical growth of the inset floodplain occurred on the Barrington River between 690 and 620 cal BP, and palynological data indicate a change from more saturated pre-incision swamp flora to less saturated post-incision swamp flora. Bankfull stage-height, achieved many times in a year, is remarkably consistent along the length of each swamp channel. Its elevation controls the overall elevation of the swamps by controlling the height of the water-table and hence the growth of <b>swamp</b> vegetation and <b>formation</b> of peat. In particular, contemporary channel dimensions control the growth and height of the inset floodplain, a process that results in the formation of an organic floodplain not previously described in the geomorphic literature.

40|$|Long-term {{perspectives}} {{on the evolution of}} river deltas have provided useful knowledge capable of responding to pending questions related to the ongoing climate and environmental changes. Increasing utilization pressure on delta environments has necessitated increased attention to protect the socio-economic and ecological values. As a result, multiple local initiatives have been designed, aimed at mitigating environmental deterioration and implementing adaptive measures, but many such initiatives have shown limited success. This thesis uses a case study of Save River delta in Mozambique to explore the relation between geomorphological evolution and socio-ecological system dynamics in delta environments. In addition, key environmental variables that concern the society today are highlighted and discussed in a management perspective. The results of the study show the development of Save River delta from the mid-Holocene to the present. The geomorphological settings of the delta suggest a faulted coastline over which subsequent deposition of fluvial sediments has formed a protruding delta front. Between c. 3000 and 1300 years ago, fine-grained sediments accumulated on top of the delta-front in the proximal part of the delta. This type of material was deposited under intertidal conditions and supported the formation of mangrove habitat. The geographical distribution of the mangrove deposit was driven by successive stages of back-barrier <b>swamp</b> <b>formation</b> and sea-level change as the delta evolved. From c. 1300 years ago, the river delta started to receive fluvial sediments from pulses of floods forming an alluvial floodplain. These sediments have accumulated mainly on the fine-grained mangrove wetland deposit. All the geomorphological features have evolved in a shoreward-shifting pattern over time. Centennial to decadal changes observed in the delta have followed a predictable geomorphological pattern, which is also part of the millennial evolution. The mangrove system, the base for the socio-economic system, is consequently strongly affected by the geomorphological development of the area. An increasing sensitivity of socio-ecological systems to environmental stressors, e. g. floods, cyclones and erosion, has motivated multiple initiatives to work towards a sustainable management of delta environments. This thesis highlights the need for interplay between geomorphology and ecology, considering both long- and short-term dynamics of delta environments. Hitherto, management initiatives have been concentrated on fragmented interventions of controlling water flow, which have disrupted the natural dynamics by obstructing the sedimentation-erosion cycle. To change this trend, coastal planners need to consider the significance of natural processes, e. g. cyclones, floods, erosion and accretion, for the long-term ecological and social sustainability of delta environments.

40|$|Daily weather, {{seasonal}} {{weather conditions}} and anomalies, long-term climate change, and natural disasters {{have had an}} outstanding influence on pre-modern Alpine economies. This paper will follow up the topics presented at the first conference in Hall (2015), which focused on the threat of avalanches and floods towards Alpine trade routes on the one hand, and on {{the economic impact of}} locust invasions on the other hand. In this paper, emphasis is given on damage caused by floods and adaptation strategies in coping with them. The examples are mostly taken from the Eastern Alps, but will be compared with evidence from the Western Alps. One impact of recurrent floods is the <b>swamp</b> <b>formation</b> in flat valley, which were used for grazing cattle. Areas like the Upper Salzach Valley south of Lake Zellersee had been flooded up to ten times a year, which made the swampy meadows not usable for agricultural use any longer. This fact is also true for areas in Switzerland such as the Linth plain southeast of Lake Zurichsee, the lower reaches of the Guerbe River south of Bern or the Grosses Moos marshland situated between Lakes Neuchâtel, Biel and Murten in the Western Swiss Plateau. Floods had also a crucial influence on the transport of timber, in particular from Alpine forests to the mining districts and to the salterns in Tyrol, in the County of Salzburg and in the Salzkammergut. If one of the wooden rakes (barriers to collect the trunks at the destination) broke due to the power of water, the trunks flushed down the river and became destructive like torpedoes. Bridges and mills were destroyed. Due to the immense loss of firewood the smelting furnaces and the salt production had to be closed for weeks or even months. If the water on the rivers was too high or too low, the transport capacities on the rivers were significantly diminished, such as salt shipping along the Salzach and lower Inn Rivers. Furthermore, most of the mills could not work during that time, causing a deep impact on local food production (flour etc.) and on the processing of goods. However, premodern societies in the Alpine areas and the nearby foothills, tried to cope and adapt with the available means. In case of a flood, warning systems existed, e. g. by local skippers. Parts of mills and bridges could be removed or reinforced quickly. The houses of craftsmen in frequently flooded areas of cities such as Steyr or Bern were solidly built of ashlar blocks in the ground floor, with the possibility to evacuate any precious goods or machines to the upper floors. Carpenters in the cities became specialized in the permanent repairs of wooden bridges and made 10 - 20 percent of their annual turnover by works related floods. Early rectification and drainage projects should make swampy floodplains re-usable for agriculture...|$|E
40|$|The Indian Ocean tsunami (IOT) of December 2004 has {{uncovered}} a till then widely unacquainted tsunami {{risk for the}} west coast of southern Thailand. To limit loss of life and damage due to potential future events, data about the frequency and magnitude of tsunamis in Thailand over a longer time period is needed. Since modern and historical tsunami recording in the Bay of Bengal is limited to the last 300 years, details about the long-term hazard have to be drawn from geological evidence of prehistoric tsunami flooding by (i) identifying new palaeotsunamis, (ii) dating and (iii) correlating spatially distinct evidence, and (iv) establishing the magnitude and the intensity of these events. For this, sediments from near-shore geoarchives in the coastal areas of Phang-nga province and Phuket (Thailand) have been sampled and analysed sedimentologically (granulometry, geochemistry, mineralogy, fauna, sedimentation modelling) and chronologically (optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon dating). Evidence of multiple prehistoric coastal flooding events in the form of allochthonous sand beds was identified in the coastal plain of Ban Bang Sak. The layers are assigned to high-energy events of marine origin, either tsunamis or tropical storms, by means of the sediment characteristics. The distinction between tsunamites and tempestites is mainly based on comparison of the palaeoevent beds with the local deposit of the IOT 2004, which revealed similarities regarding spatial extent and sediment properties. Furthermore, the radiocarbon age of the youngest palaeoevent correlates with contemporaneous tsunami evidence from India and Sumatra. Hence, the youngest event, dated to 500 - 700 cal BP, is related to a basin-wide tsunami, while several older events that took place between 2000 and 1180 cal BP preliminary are treated as tsunami candidates. Since the application of radiocarbon for dating tsunamites on Phra Thong Island is limited by the scarcity of datable macro-remains and the contamination by young roots, here, the potential of optical dating (OSL) is evaluated by applying the method to a suite of tsunamigenic and littoral deposits for which independent age control is available. Small aliquots of coarse-grained quartz were used for measurements, and processed statistically by means of appropriate age models. Cross-checking with independent radiocarbon data showed good agreement for littoral deposits and only insignificant residuals of less than 40 years for the poorly bleached deposits of the IOT 2004. These results legitimate the use of OSL to determine ages of palaeotsunamis in the same setting. Therefore, the established luminescence procedure was applied as a tool to correlate the spatially distinct sand sheets of prehistoric tsunamis that are preserved in the swales of Phra Thong’s beach-ridge plain. At least three palaeoevents – being 490 – 550, 925 – 1035 and 1740 – 2000 years old – are distinguished and correlated between the swales of Phra Thong (as an indicator for inundation distances), as well as within the Bay of Bengal (as an indicator for the impact areas). For the interpretation of onshore tsunami deposits in terms of magnitude and impact on coastal systems, the boundary conditions at the time of prehistoric tsunami events have to be taken into account. Pre-existing sea-level curves for the Malay-Thai Peninsula postulate a mid-Holocene maximum of 1 - 5 m above present sea level, whereas the exact timing and magnitude of the Holocene highstand in Thailand remained to be defined. By the use of fixed biological and geomorphological sea-level indicators a Holocene maximum of + 2. 6 m in the south and + 1. 5 - 2. 0 m in the north of the study area is assessed for c. 5500 years ago. In addition, Holocene changes of palaeogeography and their influence on local tsunami records are studied. While the patterns of palaeotsunamis recorded on Phra Thong and at Ban Bang Sak {{can be explained by the}} onset of back-barrier <b>swamp</b> <b>formation,</b> the existence of only one prehistoric tsunami deposit at Pakarang Cape is in conflict with the persistence of a back-reef lagoon, which provided favourable conditions for preservation over millennia. Although the IOT 2004 had a strong short-term impact on infrastructure, housing, ecosystems and coastal morphology in Thailand, the damaged systems have almost completely recovered after less than 10 years. For prehistoric tsunamis, the long-term impact is assessed based on variations of the sedimentary environments before and after the events. It can be shown that all recorded palaeotsunamis had only insignificant impact on the ecosystems and the geomorphology of Phra Thong Island, Ban Bang Sak and Pakarang Cape. To deduce transport processes and hydrodynamic parameters of tsunami events from the onshore deposits found at Ban Bang Sak, as an estimate of palaeotsunami magnitude, two different ap-proaches are applied. (i) The maximum offshore sediment source is determined using granulometry, geochemistry, mineralogy, and foraminifera of tsunamites and reference samples from various marine and terrestrial environments. (ii) By means of sedimentation modelling, onshore flow velocities and flow depths of the associated tsunami waves are estimated. The approach is evaluated by means of the IOT 2004, for which modelled flow velocities and onshore flow depths, as well as the deduced sediment source are in good agreement with quotations based on survivor videos and post-tsunami field surveys. For the 500 - 700 year old predecessor with modelled flow velocities and flow depths of 4. 1 - 5. 9 m/s and 7. 0 m, respectively, a magnitude similar to the IOT 2004 is reconstructed. The deposits of the three tsunami candidates dated to 1180 - 2000 cal BP partly indicate source areas equal to the IOT 2004, suggesting events of comparable size, and partly indicate a much shallower sediment source, pointing to a storm origin or tsunamis of a lesser magnitude. In conclusion, a recurrence interval of 500 - 600 years for tsunamis in southwest Thailand is estimated on the basis of sedimentary evidence. Since all tsunamis recorded in Thailand are triggered by mega-ruptures of the Sunda Arc with similar magnitude and geometry as the 2004 earthquake, which have not only local but basin-wide impact, the data from Thailand provide valuable information for the assessment of future tsunami risk in other countries around the northern Indian Ocean, as well. ...|$|E
30|$|Santanghu Coalfield is {{the largest}} {{integrated}} coalfield exploration area in China. The major coal seams developing in Xishanyao Formation (Middle Jurassic) are the high-quality steam coals characterized by large thickness, favorable horizontal continuity and high coal quality. In this paper, twenty-two samples were collected from the three typical boreholes in Hanshuiquan district, representing the 11 coal seam sequences (7 #, 8 #, 9 #, 13 #, 14 #, 15 #, 17 #, 18 #, 19 #, 20 #, 22 #), respectively. The petrographic characteristics of the coal-bearing sequence in Xishanyao Formation were firstly summarized systematicly, and then the coal-forming swamp characteristics and succession mechanism of the coal seam in Xishanyao Formation were defined by analyzing the samples. The maceral composition, structure, geochemical and geophysical characteristics of coal are included in original genetic criteria of coal-forming swamp analysis. And the composition of coal petrography, maceral and microlithotype are {{the most frequently used}} parameters. Coal is composed of microscopic constituents and inorganic substances. The Xishanyao Formation maceral mainly consists of vitrinite (65.74 %– 97.01 %), inertinite (1.93 %– 34 %), and the exinite shows the mode of regular change. The coal-forming <b>swamp</b> in Xishanyao <b>Formation</b> possesses the characteristics of mainly marsh, wet forest swamp facies, and shallow water covered forest swamp facies, and a few of coal seams distribute in the deep water covered forest swamp facies. In addition, the sporopollens in Xishanyao Formation are mainly Pinaceae evergreen broad leaf and needle-leaved plants, Osmundaceae, Cyatheaceae and Lygodiaceae, indicating that the warm and humid tropic-subtropical climate conductive to the persistent growth of coal-forming plants in the Middle Jurassic. The coal-forming swamp shows the characteristics of vertically upward fluctuation through the periodic transition. It indicates a shallow-deep-shallow change process of the water covered depth in the swamp. This is the principal factor for the formation of the high-quality and continuous coal seam in Hanshuiquan district, Santanghu Coalfield.|$|R

An and Ma (2013) studied the No. 9 coal seam at Hanshuiquan and Tiaohu sags in Santanhu, and judged {{that it is the}} long flame coal characterized by low or extremely low ash, high volatiles, extremely low sulfur, high calorific value, high thermo stability, easy selection, high content of arsenic, extremely low chloride, low phosphorous, low fluorine, and high content of oil. A preliminary study on the arsenic in Santanghu coal field was carried out by Huang (2014), and pointed out that arsenic is abundant in the pyrite. In term of the coal-forming swamp, Chinese coal geology scholars studied the coal-forming swamps of the Jurassic coal accumulating basins in the north of Xinjiang since 2010. For instance, Nie et al. (2016) pointed out that the coal-forming swamp in Turpan-Hami Basin is mainly comprise of wetland marsh facies and wetland forest swamp facies. Li et al. (2012 a, b) deemed that the coal-forming swamp mainly consists of dry forest swamp facies and wetland forest swamp facies in eastern Junggar coalfield. Alimujiang et al. (2014) considered that the coal-forming swamp is mainly composed of wetland swamp facies and wet forest swamp facies in southern Junggar coalfield. Zhang et al. (2015) studied the Jurassic coal-forming swamp in Santanghu, and believed that the major coal seam in Xishanyao Formation is transited from wide water marsh to wet forest swamp, and through the research of its coal petrography and coal-forming swamp, he found that exinite content is zero. This might be resulted from the small quantity of sample, which fails to accurately reflect the evolutionary characteristics of the coal-forming swamp in this area. For this reason, the major coal seams in Hanshuiquan district, Santanghu Coalfield are selected to study the coal-forming swamp characteristics and evolution rules. Moreover, this paper makes a comparison with the previously studied on coal-forming <b>swamp</b> of Xishanyao <b>Formation</b> in Xinjiang to study the type and characteristic of coal-forming swamp and its evolution characteristic in Xishanyao Formation (Teichmüller and Teichmüller 1982).|$|R
