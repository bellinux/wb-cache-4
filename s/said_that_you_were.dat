2500|$|Senator Kerry, {{after talking}} to several {{co-workers}} and family and friends, I asked the ones {{who said they were}} not voting for you, why. They <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> too wishy-washy. Do you have a reply for them? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going. You oughtn't to let {{anything}} {{stand in the}} way of your doing the best you can for yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, I {{remember}} you very well. I {{do not see}} people often enough to forget them. And papa <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> coming home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yours, Monsieur... yours, I pray you.... Have I not <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> like {{a pretty}} woman?... Place aux dames, sir! always!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I gather {{from what}} <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> no longer {{blessed with the}} {{presence}} of the excellent lady, your mother," [...] presently added Mr. Belamour.|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>you</b> <b>were</b> with Clark in Illinois?" [...] {{said the}} Baron, craftily. [...] "Pardon me, Mr. Ritchie, but I should have <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> too young." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Josiah, {{think of}} the parish,--of the people who respect you,--for their sakes let it not be <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> taken away by policemen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] he stammered. [...] "Worthy <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> up here, but I {{thought he}} was crazy the way he talked--I didn't think--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it must be. Everybody <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{to be one}} of them if {{you could}} get the other people out. Is it Mr. Bonteen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{other day}} they said <b>you</b> <b>were</b> trifling with him, and <b>you</b> almost proved <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not; lately they have <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> not, and <b>you</b> {{straightway}} begin to show--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly Peter {{remembered what}} Jenny Wren had told him. [...] "Was Jenny Wren {{telling you the}} truth when she <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a second cousin of hers?" [...] he asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did ventur' {{to speak}} on that subject, Mabel, and the Sergeant has even lately <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> kindly disposed; but I am not a man to persecute the thing I love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a dama de grandeza, you remember," [...] {{said the}} {{youthful}} Mrs. Keene to Mrs. Hurlstone, [...] "and, you see, you are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{she knows}} YOU. When you {{came through the}} lobby just now she <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> the only real human being she had ever met." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I am Tortoise,' said Slow-and-Solid. Your {{mother was}} quite right. She <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to scoop {{me out of}} my shell with your paw. Begin.' ...|$|E
2500|$|With Judaism, therefore, {{we have a}} {{relationship}} which {{we do not have}} with any other religion. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> our dearly beloved brothers, and in a certain way, it could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> our elder brothers.|$|R
6000|$|Well, now, {{what have}} {{you to tell me}} about the Termagant? <b>You</b> have already <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> one of her crew, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in the boat that day when we had a row about the whale. What more can you tell me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> CÃ¦sar," [...] {{answered}} Marcus. [...] "Now it is {{sunset and}} I am free; accompany {{me to my}} house, I pray you, for there much business waits me in which I need counsel, who am overborne." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah,--that's {{just the}} question. If anybody had asked me, I should have <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{the man of}} all men whom I could have best trusted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{with your}} {{immediate}} future. I thought you <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{trying to get}} a job. Have you given up the idea of newspaper work, then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do {{you think}} that, Charlotte? You <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{convinced}} you had wounded one of the men; so {{they ought to be}} able to trace him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{you mention}} it, I do {{remember}} {{something of the}} sort; draw a chair, Clinch, and take a glass of grog. Tim, put a bottle of Jamaica before Mr. Clinch, I have heard it <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> married yourself, my gallant master's mate?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was ill talking last night," [...] {{the prior}} said, [...] "with a man hungry and worn out; but I {{gathered}} from what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{not only a}} follower of Bruce, but <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> with him at that fatal day at Dumfries when he drew his dagger upon Comyn in the sanctuary." ...|$|R
5000|$|Another anecdote {{says that}} al-Nabigha told al-Khansa [...] "If Abu Basir had not already recited to me, I would have <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> the {{greatest}} poet of the Arabs. Go, for <b>you</b> <b>are</b> the greatest poet {{among those with}} breasts." [...] Al-Khansa replied, [...] "I'm the greatest poet among those with testicles, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} best to know nothing at all," [...] she replied. [...] "I simply <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going {{to have dinner with}} some of your new friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't inquire, sir. I <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not at home; but, as {{he seemed}} very pressing, I promised {{to try and}} {{ascertain}} when you would be at liberty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you'll {{think again}} you'll find that I didn't say {{anything}} of the kind. I said that your mother <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to scoop {{me out of my}} shell,' said Slow-and-Solid.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the longest}} {{standing}} traditions surrounding the Westcott fountain is being dunked in the water {{by a group of}} friends on their 21st birthdays as a way to welcome the person to the legal drinking age and it <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not truly a Seminole until <b>you</b> have <b>been</b> dunked in there.|$|R
6000|$|For {{some reason}} that the princess could not guess these words seemed to displease the bird, {{and he did not}} answer. The princess waited a moment, and then {{continued}} in severe tones, [...] "Have <b>you</b> forgotten <b>that</b> <b>you</b> yourself <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> my slave to do my bidding, and also that your life is in my power?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, we {{were only}} in London a few hours. By the way, Lord Wisbeach, my sister--"--Mrs. Pett paused; she disliked to have to mention her sister or to refer to this subject at all, but curiosity impelled her--"my sister <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a great friend of her step-son, James Crocker. I didn't know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> knew him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why did you {{not return}} at once, when the chief who {{captured}} you <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> his guest? Was there not some fair young Afridi, who held you in her chains?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{going to}} see him, and somehow, I don't know why, I have been rather {{worrying}} over it. Was the interview satisfactory, did you learn what you wanted?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{might be}} the Peter Michaeloff I know," [...] the {{governor}} said. [...] "You are sure he <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to ask for him, {{if you were a}} second time taken prisoner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may, perhaps, help to {{show you}} the {{necessity}} there is for your return, if I mention one other assertion respecting yourself, which is in everybody's mouth. Your absence is, I regret to tell you, attributed to the meanest of all motives. It <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> remaining in London because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> afraid {{to show you}}r face at Thorpe Ambrose.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you mean, by what <b>you</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{going to}} {{challenge}} me to a duel, I tell <b>you</b> at once <b>that</b> I shall not accept it. I have, sir," [...] and {{he raised his}} head proudly, [...] "proved my courage; and France has recognized it, in the rank and honor she has given me. We English--for I am English--do not fight duels.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, odiously--among {{those that}} matter. It <b>is</b> <b>said</b> even <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> Omnes Omnibus, though that I cannot, will not believe." ...|$|R
