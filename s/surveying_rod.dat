40|$|Surface {{elevation}} profiles {{were measured}} {{before and after}} overlay operations on runways at two commercial airports in the USA. Each airport had only one runway. All overlaying was done at night, with the airports opened for normal operations during the day. The profiles were measured with an inertial profiler having software compensation for accelerometer errors. Pavement surface elevations measured with normal <b>surveying</b> <b>rod</b> and level equipment are compared with the profiler elevation measurements {{for one of the}} runways. With the exception of some very long wavelength distortion in the profiler measurements, correspondence between the two different methods is good. The profiles were processed to provide measures of roughness from simulations of a straightedge, a California Profilograph, and the Boeing Bump Criteria. The roughness of the overlaid pavements is quantified and compared. Measurements of the vertical response of an instrumented B- 727 aircraft on one of the runways are also presented. Transverse construction joints are shown to be significant contributors to the roughness of the pavements...|$|E
40|$|CIVINSThis {{engineering}} report {{describes the}} measurement techniques and {{results of an}} equilibrium beach profile survey and sediment analysis. The main objective {{of the project was}} to obtain an accurate equilibrium beach profile at a location on Mustang Island, and to compare the actual profile to a predicted profile. The predicted profile is based on the median grain size diameter of sediment samples taken from the dune crest to approximately 4000 ft offshore. The survey was accomplished using an electronic total station with a standard <b>surveying</b> <b>rod</b> on land, and the underwater profile was measured with a sled towed behind a boat. A triple prism was attached to both the top of the rod and sled. The sled is an aluminum and steel structure equipped with two 12 ft long skids and a 36. 5 ft mast. The predicted profiles are based on two methods. One method uses Dean's equation for equilibrium beach profiles, z = Ax 2 / 3, where z is the water depth, A is the profile scale factor related to the sediment fall velocity, and x is the distance offshore. The other method involves a more complex analysis described by Dean and Dalrymple, which accounts for a variation in sediment size and profile scale factor, A, in the offshore direction. Both methods are described and compared in this report. This data will also be used by Dr. R. G. Dean of the University of Florida in a study he is conducting on equilibrium beach profile prediction[URL]...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{instrument}} system isdescribed whereby beach profiles may be surveyed by one man {{without the aid}} of a field assistant. The accuracy ofthe method istested and shown to give results within about + _. 07 feet vertically with traverse l gs less than 30 feet in horizontal distance. The procedure has additional ppeal because the equipment is inexpensive and portable and the profile can usually be completed more quickly than by using a level and rod. INTRODU CTION Studies of the coastal zone nearly always in-clude measurements of changes to the subaer-ial beach profile over time. Most commonly, these are carried out at times of low tide, with a telescopic level and a <b>surveying</b> <b>rod.</b> Breaks in slope along the shore-normal profile are marked. Starting with a backsight to a bench-mark on the backshore to establish a "height of instrument, " the survey rod is sighted at each break in slope as the rod man progresses seaward as far as is prudent. Elevations are calculated by subtracting the rod readings from the "height of instrument, " and horizon-tal distances between the stations are calcu-lated from the interval between the upper and lower stadia hairs. This method, with only minor modifica-tions, is the one in most widespread use and has much to recommend it. It is simple, rea-sonably fast, and accurate. K. O. Emery has also developed a useful method of profiling that uses two men and two wooden rods, eliminating the need for a telescopic level (Emery, 1961). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe an alternative method of obtaining beach profiles which, while not intended to replace either of the techniques mentioned above, offers impor-tant advantages in that it is quicker and re-quires only one man with a minimum of equipment to carry out the survey...|$|E
40|$|Two {{expeditions to}} the middle Kuril Islands [IMGG FED RAS, NSF Kurils Biocomplexity Project] {{in the summer of}} 2007 yielded tsunami runup and {{inundation}} measurements from the 15 Nov 2006 Mw 8. 3 subduction-zone earthquake, and possibly from the 13 Jan 2007 Mw 8. 1 earthquake seaward of the subduction zone. Both earthquakes produced measurable tsunamis in the far field, the 13 Jan tsunami significantly smaller; the 15 Nov tsunami did some damage in the harbor of Crescent City, CA. Ours are the first near-source measurements because no one lives in the middle Kurils. Moreover, because KBP visited many of the same sites in summer of 2006, we have numerous before-and-after comparisons, including quantified erosion. We measured 120 profiles and made more than 300 runup measurements. We found dramatic tsunami effects of erosion and deposition, with widespread runup of 8 - 12 m, up to about 20 m, between and including Simushir and Matua islands. In most cases, we measured runup with a transit and <b>surveying</b> <b>rod,</b> producing a topographic profile from sea level to the slope above runup indicators; in some cases, we used a hand level and tape. Runup/inundation criteria were generally subhorizontal lines of floatable debris, typically wood, plastic, glass floats, and styrofoam. Single occurrences, e. g., of a plastic bottle were not considered adequate. Corroborative evidence, not used independently, included limits of consistently oriented stems of tall grasses and flowers, limit of sand and gravel deposits above turf and dead vegetation, and elevation of fresh erosion of turf from slopes landward of the beach plain. Currently we are compiling, correcting and vetting our measurements, which will be submitted to online databases. Topographic profiles obviously had an effect on the data, with short, steep profiles generating high runup and short inundation; most beach-ridge profiles had longer inundation and shorter runup. However, at Ainu Bay on Matua Island, we found as much as 18 - 20 m of runup at the landward limit of inundation 350 - 400 m inland. Our survey did not include islands north of Matua; the next major island, Shiashkotan, is almost 100 km away, so it is hard to predict effects there. Some preliminary results [m runup height at landward limit, m inundation distance]: Matua, Pacific coast [6 - 17, 50 - 100]; Matua, South Bay [6 - 8, 100 - 220]; Matua, Ainu Bay [12 - 20, 70 - 400]; Rasshua, Okhotsk coast, [5 - 10; 50 - 65]; Ryponkicha, Pacific coast [10 - 11, 45 - 55]; Ketoi south coast [6 - 9; 45 - 65]; NE Simushir [7 - 19; 50 - 150]; SE Simushir [5 - 7; 80 - 140].

40|$|Salt marshes {{are well}} known as {{specialized}} habitats that provide coastal populations with many ecosystem services and these systems can also build in elevation with low to moderate rates of sea level rise. Traditional methods of measuring elevation change (<b>survey</b> with <b>rod)</b> are only able to track salt marsh building over relatively long time periods and do not distinguish between accretion and change in elevation. In contrast, the Surface Elevation Table (SET) installed with marker horizons can measure accretion of sediment as well as elevation change in 3 to 5 years. SETs were installed and monitored in several tidal marshes in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine in the period from 1994 to 2002. Data indicated elevations were {{keeping up with the}} approximately 2. 0 mm/year of SLR, mostly by accretion, which was typically found to be slightly greater than elevation gain. In 2011 - 2012, we revisited these sites. Preliminary analysis of the data from three SETs in one marsh shows rapid elevation gains over the 2000 to 2011 period of 4. 3 +/ 1. 5 mm/year. Elevation gain in the marsh was even greater than new rapid global rates of SLR calculated from sea surface altimetry data (Church and White 2011), indicating that the marsh was likely keeping up with SLR, but also that the salt marsh may rovide a rapid, integrated estimate of recent SLR...|$|R
40|$|WinXSPRO is an {{interactive}} Windows â„¢ software package designed to analyze stream channel cross section data for geometric, hydraulic, and sediment transport parameters. WinXSPRO was specifically developed {{for use in}} high-gradient streams (gradient> 0. 01) and supports four alternative resistance equations for computing boundary roughness and resistance to flow. Cross section input data may be from standard cross section <b>surveys</b> using a <b>rod</b> and level or sag-tape procedures. WinXSPRO allows the user to subdivide the channel cross section into multiple sub-sections and {{has the ability to}} vary watersurface slopes with discharge to reflect natural conditions. Analysis options include developing stagedischarge relationships, evaluating changes in channel cross-sectional area, and computing sediment transport rates. Resource specialists can use the estimated stream-channel geometry cross section hydraulic characteristics and sediment transport output to assist with channel design and monitoring, instream flow analysis, the restoration of riparian areas, and the placement of instream structures...|$|R
50|$|A rod is {{the same}} length as a perch, also {{sometimes}} called a pole which measure using cordage or wood, slightly antedated the use of both rods and surveyors chains, made of more dimensionally regular materials. Its name derives from the Ancient Roman unit, the pertica.The measure also has a relationship to the military pike of {{about the same size}} and both measures date from the sixteenth century, when that weapon was still utilized in national armies. The tool, normally configured as a metal rod with eye-ends (loops that could be hooked together), was used commonly until quite recently, when it was supplanted by electronic tools such as surveyor lasers (Lidar) and optical target devices for <b>surveying</b> lands. Surveyors <b>rods</b> and chains are still utilized in rough terrains with heavy overgrowth where laser or other optical measurements are difficult or impossible.

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} the nutritional status (underweight and overweight) among Meitei children and adolescents. Methods. Cross-sectional data on 854 subjects (384 boys and 470 girls) were {{collected during the}} months of May 2009 to August 2009 following house-to-house <b>survey.</b> An anthropometric <b>rod</b> and a weighing scale were used to measure height and weight. The presence of underweight and overweight has been evaluated using the international cutoff points for children and adolescents. MS-Excel software was used for all statistical analyses. Results. A high prevalence of underweight (30. 21 %) and overweight (3. 12 %) {{in the present study}} was found among children and adolescent boys, respectively. Among girls, the prevalence of both underweight (33. 86 %) and overweight (5. 18 %) was reported higher among children than adolescents, and the differences in the distribution were significant at 0. 05 levels. The overall prevalence of underweight (28. 29 %) was found more or less the same among boys and girls, but overweight (5. 10 %) was reported higher among girls than boys (2. 34 %). Conclusion. The possible reasons for both forms of malnutrition among Meitei children and adolescents could be traced through poverty, low dietary intake, socioeconomic condition, nutrition transition, and changing lifestyles. The other possible reasons could be due to peer pressure, eating habits, or emotional factor...|$|R
5000|$|The tunnel was {{constructed}} {{as part of}} the Milwaukee Road's [...] "Pacific Coast Extension" [...] project, undertaken {{in the first decade of}} the 1900s. It expanded its concentration of railroad lines in the upper Midwest area of Milwaukee-Chicago-Minneapolis-St. Paul across the Rocky Mountains to Washington, ending at the Seattle-Tacoma area on Puget Sound. The construction occurred late in the historical era of American railroading; it was the last transcontinental line built. Surveying began in 1901 and continued until 1909, when a final golden spike was driven in Montana at Garrison. [...] The St. Paul Pass route was surveyed from Butte starting in August 1906 and continuing through November, using the tools of the era: transit, stadia <b>rod,</b> <b>surveying</b> chain, and barometer. [...] The Milwaukee Road was committed to a route with no more than a two percent grade, and the surveying west of Butte to the St. Paul Pass was thorough and extensive; it covered some 1400 mi in order to select a route of 240 mi. [...] As a result of this diligent work, the surveyors and engineers achieved a very even low grade of 1.7% grade from Haugan on the east to Avery on the west in Idaho. [...] This gentle gradient allowed trains to cross the pass with long loads fairly easily. Exiting the west portal in Idaho, the route descends through several shorter tunnels, to Avery at just under 2500 ft, and on down the St. Joe River another 300 ft to St. Maries.|$|R
