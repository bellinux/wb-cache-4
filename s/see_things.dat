5|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle a spiritualist who {{supported}} the mediumship of Home stated that he was unusual in that he had four different types of mediumship: direct voice (the ability to let spirits audibly speak); trance speaker (the ability to let spirits speak through oneself); clairvoyant (ability to <b>see</b> <b>things</b> {{that are out of}} view); and physical medium (moving objects at a distance, levitation, etc., which was the type of mediumship in which he had no equal).|$|E
5|$|Carol buys a car, and the McCoys {{drive to}} an {{electronics}} store. As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches {{off the television}} set near the proprietor's desk broadcasting {{the news of the}} earlier incidents they were involved in. Suddenly, all the television sets in the store show Doc's picture, prompting him to leave immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse of the picture, and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun, followed by several shoot-outs and police chases. The couple escape by hiding in a large trash bin, only to end up {{in the back of a}} garbage truck that dumps its load at the local landfill. Filthy and frustrated, they argue about whether to stay together or split up. They decide to <b>see</b> <b>things</b> through.|$|E

25|$|Barrie {{was very}} perspicacious in noticing {{many aspects of}} children's mental {{development}} decades before they were studied by cognitive psychologists. In particular, Peter lacks the mental capacity for secondary mental representation and cannot recollect the past, anticipate the future, consider two things at once or <b>see</b> <b>things</b> from another person's point of view. He is therefore amnesic, inconsequential, impulsive and callous.|$|E

25|$|The {{course is}} {{designed}} to give marketers the opportunity to <b>see</b> <b>things</b> {{from the point of}} view of their agency - learning through doing - which often gives them a completely new perspective on that relationship. It's also renowned throughout the industry for incredibly late nights and much drunken bonding, giving clients and agencies an insight into each other's worlds. It's even been known to influence real-world client/agency relationships, with one story speculating that many years ago, Guinness switched its multimillion-pound advertising account to J. Walter Thompson as a result of one such seminar.|$|E
5000|$|Whether {{or not it}} was {{possible}} to see God, was one of the common issues discussed at the time of al-Hadi who believed it was impossible to see Him. He argued that [...] "seeing is not possible if there is no air (space) between the seer and the <b>seen</b> <b>thing</b> through which sight goes through. If there is no air and no light between the seer and the <b>seen</b> <b>thing,</b> there will be no sight. When the seer equals the <b>seen</b> <b>thing</b> in the cause of sight between them, sight takes place, but those who compare the seer (man) to Allah, they are mistaken because they liken Allah to man…for effects must relate to causes." ...|$|R

25|$|There {{are various}} forms of {{forgiveness}} interventions. One common adaptation used by researchers is where patients are forced to confront the entity preventing them from forgiving by using introspective techniques and expressing this to the therapist. Another popular forgiveness intervention is getting individual to try and <b>see</b> <b>things</b> from the offender's point of view. The end goal for this adaptation is getting the individual to perhaps understand the reasoning behind the offender's actions. If {{they are able to}} do this then {{they might be able to}} forgive the offender more easily.|$|E
25|$|Ehrman {{examines}} the historicity of Jesus and includes some criticism of Christ mythicists. As {{he does in}} other works such as Forged and Jesus, Interrupted, he disregards an apologetics-based or otherwise religiously-charged approach to aim at looking at the New Testament using historical-critical methodology. He argues that a specific historical Jesus {{is likely to have}} really existed in the 1st century AD. Even as accounts about that figure later on brought in additional misinformation and legendary stories, Ehrman states, multiple reasons still remain to <b>see</b> <b>things</b> as framed around a flesh-and-blood actual person, at least at first.|$|E
25|$|Fixed: The fixed {{signs are}} Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius. A native with mainly fixed signs has the {{strength}} and endurance to <b>see</b> <b>things</b> through and to uphold the status quo. They need stable homes, careers and partnerships and prefer the known to uncertainty. Fixed subjects are loyal and dependable but can be very obstinate. A subject lacking fixed signs cannot stick with anything or see anything through, and will tend {{to walk away from}} problems. They may be too easily bored or too busy chasing rainbows ever to make anything substantial happen. Planets in the 2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th houses, or an emphasis on earth in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

[...] All {{marketing to}} the typical Christian music stations used by his first solo album and his albums with Caedmon's Call was stopped, though the album still has explicitly Christian lyrics. [...] In comparison to Webb's previous work, this album has what's {{been referred to as}} an [...] "experimental" [...] style to it, and has been compared to the music of Wilco in that respect. Webb has stated that the album [...] "was doing away with people's expectations in order to free me up to do what I wanted."

500|$|Ezrin, {{with his}} {{classical}} and folk background, attempted {{to have the}} band tighten the loosely structured songs. [...] The band resisted at first but came to <b>see</b> <b>things</b> Ezrin's way, and ten to twelve hours a day of rehearsal resulted in a tight set of hard rock songs with little of the psychedelic freak-rock aesthetic {{of the first two}} albums. [...] According to Cooper, Ezrin [...] "ironed the songs out note by note, giving them coloring, personality". [...] Ezrin rearranged [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] from an eight-minute jam piece called [...] "I Wish I Was 18 Again" [...] to a taut three-minute rocker.|$|E
500|$|The {{central issue}} in Chinese Zen {{philosophy}} of mind {{is in the}} difference between the pure and awakened mind and the defiled mind. Chinese Chan master Huangpo described the mind as without beginning and without form or limit while the defiled mind was that which was obscured by attachment to form and concepts. [...] The pure Buddha-mind is thus able to <b>see</b> <b>things</b> [...] "as they truly are", as absolute and non-dual [...] "thusness" [...] (Tathatā). This non-conceptual seeing also includes the paradoxical fact that there is no difference between a defiled and a pure mind, as well as no difference between samsara and nirvana.|$|E
