25|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a chronic}} disease, {{for which there}} is no known cure except in very <b>specific</b> <b>situations.</b> Management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal, without causing low blood sugar. This can usually be accomplished with a healthy diet, exercise, weight loss, and use of appropriate medications (insulin in the case of type1 diabetes; oral medications, as well as possibly insulin, in type2 diabetes).|$|E

25|$|Trait {{models have}} been criticized as being purely {{descriptive}} and offering little explanation of {{the underlying causes of}} personality. Eysenck's theory, however, proposes biological mechanisms as driving traits, and modern behavior genetics researchers have shown a clear genetic substrate to them. Another potential weakness of trait theories is that they may lead some people to accept oversimplified classifications—or worse, offer advice—based on a superficial analysis of personality. Finally, trait models often underestimate the effect of <b>specific</b> <b>situations</b> on people's behavior. Traits are considered to be statistical generalizations that do not always correspond to an individual's behavior.|$|E

United States Army Special Forces {{are among the most}} versatile organizations, but not all their capabilities may be needed for a specific FID situation. For example, the most urgent need might be for public health specialists or airfield construction crews, which operate on a level far beyond the medical or engineering specialists of a US Special Forces unit. Public health or construction organizations, however, have limited or no self-defense capability and will need protection in insecure areas.|$|E
25|$|Giffen {{goods are}} {{difficult}} to study because the definition requires a number of observable conditions. One reason for the difficulty in studying market demand for Giffen goods that is Giffen originally envisioned a specific situation faced by individuals in poverty. Modern consumer behaviour research methods often deal in aggregates that average out income levels, and are too blunt an instrument to capture these <b>specific</b> <b>situations.</b> Complicating the matter are the requirements for limited availability of substitutes, {{as well as that}} the consumers are not so poor that they can only afford the inferior good. For this reason, many text books use the term Giffen paradox rather than Giffen good.|$|E
25|$|For hemorrhagic strokes, a CT or MRI scan with {{intravascular}} contrast {{may be able}} {{to identify}} abnormalities in the brain arteries (such as aneurysms) or other sources of bleeding, and structural MRI if this shows no cause. If this too does not identify an underlying reason for the bleeding, invasive cerebral angiography could be performed but this requires access to the bloodstream with an intravascular catheter and can cause further strokes as well as complications at the insertion site and this investigation is therefore reserved for <b>specific</b> <b>situations.</b> If there are symptoms suggesting that the hemorrhage might have occurred as a result of venous thrombosis, CT or MRI venography can be used to examine the cerebral veins.|$|E

25|$|Applied {{behavior}} analysis, a research-based science utilizing behavioral {{principles of}} operant conditioning, {{is effective in}} a range of educational settings. For example, teachers can alter student behavior by systematically rewarding students who follow classroom rules with praise, stars, or tokens exchangeable for sundry items. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of awards in changing behavior, their use in education has been criticized by proponents of self-determination theory, who claim that praise and other rewards undermine intrinsic motivation. There is evidence that tangible rewards decrease intrinsic motivation in <b>specific</b> <b>situations,</b> such as when the student already has a high level of intrinsic motivation to perform the goal behavior. But the results showing detrimental effects are counterbalanced by evidence that, in other situations, such as when rewards are given for attaining a gradually increasing standard of performance, rewards enhance intrinsic motivation. Many effective therapies have been based on the principles of applied behavior analysis, including pivotal response therapy which is used to treat autism spectrum disorders.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} versus {{risks of}} placing a nasogastric tube {{in those with}} upper GI bleeding are not determined. Endoscopy within 24hours is recommended, in addition to medical management. A number of endoscopic treatments may be used, including: epinephrine injection, band ligation, sclerotherapy, and fibrin glue depending on what is found. Prokinetic agents such as erythromycin before endocopy can decrease the amount {{of blood in the}} stomach and thus improve the operators view. They also decrease the amount of blood transfusions required. Early endoscopy decreases hospital and the amount of blood transfusions needed. A second endoscopy within a day is routinely recommended by some but by others only in <b>specific</b> <b>situations.</b> Proton pump inhibitors, if they have not been started earlier, are recommended in those in whom high risk signs for bleeding are found. High and low dose PPIs appear equivalent at this point. It is also recommended that people with high risk signs are kept in hospital for at least 72hours. Those at low risk of re-bleeding may begin eating typically 24 hours following endoscopy. If other measures fail or are not available, esophageal balloon tamponade may be attempted. While there is a success rate up to 90%, there are some potentially significant complications including aspiration and esophageal perforation.|$|E
25|$|The modern Aes Sedai {{operate as}} self-appointed {{guardians of the}} One Power and are often viewed as above local and {{national}} politics. They view themselves as the rightful owners of all angreal and arbiters of {{anything to do with}} the One Power. They operate as advisers to kings and queens and are shown deference by most. Some nations, however, have banned channeling and view Aes Sedai as suspect, if not outright evil. Aes Sedai search the world for females with the inherent ability to channel, or the ability to be taught to channel, and bring any they find to the Tower. Untrained channelers can be a danger to themselves and others, often resulting in accidental deaths. Channelers of a certain age that have survived without Tower training are often derisively referred to as wilders by Aes Sedai. Wilders often experience blocks: an inability to access the One Power except through specific rituals or in <b>specific</b> <b>situations.</b> In many instances these wilders have no idea they are channeling or accessing the One Power at all. With training and time, blocks can often be overcome and the wilder can channel at will. Foreign lands outside the Aes Sedai's purview often handle channeling and channelers quite differently from Aes Sedai custom and tend to distrust their assumed authority. Aes Sedai consider them wilders as well, and not entirely without reason. Most foreign channeling traditions have more specific and more limited understanding of the One Power than do Aes Sedai. Additionally, most of these traditions trace their origins back to offshoots of the original Aes Sedai split off after the Breaking of the World. The Aes Sedai, however, can trace their history well back within the Age of Legends.|$|E

500|$|Despite being {{a member}} of Slipknot since 1999, it was the first album where guitarist Jim Root had been {{significantly}} involved. He had joined them during the later recording stages of Slipknot and subsequently became more involved with this album. During an interview with Guitar magazine in November 2001 he explained, [...] "it was so exciting as well as scary {{to be part of this}} whole huge process", adding that there was a lot of pressure from fellow guitarist Mick Thomson to perform well on the record. In an interview with FHM in December 2001, vocalist Corey Taylor revealed that he put himself in <b>specific</b> <b>situations</b> to achieve his performance on the album. While recording vocals for the final song [...] "Iowa" [...] he was completely naked, vomiting all over himself and cutting himself with broken glass. Explaining this, he said, [...] "that's where the best stuff comes from. You've got to break yourself down before you can build something great." [...] While producing the album, Ross Robinson was injured from a dirt bike accident, fracturing his back. He returned to the studio after a day of hospital treatment, reportedly [...] "putting all of his pain into the album", much to the admiration of the band.|$|E
