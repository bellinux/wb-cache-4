5|$|In {{another version}} of the story, the king adopted all of the {{children}} of his sister Rangorimanana. He then devised a test to determine which one would succeed him. He requested his messengers to bring the children a package including lemons, meat, honey, rice, milk and a reed, and to note which child took the reed and <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> the central pillar of the house; this child was Rakotomavo.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Belgrano <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> {{a window}} and, {{in the event}} of a {{problematic}} development, he would give a signal by waiving a white cloth, upon which the people gathered in the Plaza would force their way into the Cabildo. However, there were no problems and this emergency plan was not implemented. The historian Vicente Fidel López revealed that his father, Vicente López y Planes, who was present at the event, saw that Mariano Moreno was worried near the end in spite of the majority achieved. Moreno told Planes that the Cabildo was about to betray them.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} stages of World War I, Andranik {{commanded}} the first Armenian volunteer battalion within the Russian Imperial army against the Ottoman Empire, capturing and later governing much of the traditional Armenian homeland. After the Revolution of 1917, the Russian army retreated and left the Armenian irregulars outnumbered against the Turks. Andranik led the defense of Erzurum in early 1918, but was forced to retreat eastward. By May 1918, Turkish forces <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> Yerevanthe future Armenian capitaland were halted at the Battle of Sardarabad. The Dashnak-dominated Armenian National Council declared the independence of Armenia and signed the Treaty of Batum with the Ottoman Empire, by which Armenia gave up its rights to Western Armenia. Andranik never accepted the existence of the First Republic of Armenia because it included {{only a small part of}} the area many Armenians hoped to make independent. Andranik, independently from the Republic of Armenia, fought in Zangezur against the Azerbaijani and Turkish armies and helped to keep it within Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Uttanka {{then saw}} two {{beautiful}} women weaving with {{white and black}} threads on a wheel fixed on the wall. The wheel had twelve spokes and was being turned by six young people. A horse with a rider <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> the wheel. Uttanka praised {{the functioning of the}} weaving process, the rider and the horse, and equated the rider to Indra. Pleased with this praise, the rider asked Uttanka to state in what way he could help him. Uttanka requested that he be given the power to bring the snakes under his control. The rider then instructed Uttanka to blow {{at the back of the}} horse. Uttanka did as suggested. Then flames emerged from all parts of the horse's body and filled the realm of the serpents with fire and smoke. The terrified Takshaka came out of hiding and gave up the earrings to Uttanka.|$|E

25|$|An ancient castle once <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> {{where the}} Cathedral of St. Eunan and St. Columba stands today. Letterkenny Castle, built in 1625, was located south of Mt Southwell on Castle Street. Outlaw Redmond O' Hanlon found refuge there in 1690. No {{remains of the}} castle exist today.|$|E
25|$|Competing hotels {{opened up}} nearby {{over the next}} several decades. The Kaaterskill Hotel, founded by a disgruntled Mountain House guest, was located near the summit of South Mountain. The more modest Laurel House <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> the top of Kaaterskill Falls. Several hoteliers {{attempted}} to make a similar success on the summit of Overlook Mountain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the midst}} of the strife in Chicago, Cornelius Shea was re-elected by acclamation on August 8, 1904, at the Teamsters {{convention}} in Cincinnati, Ohio.

25|$|Green hill, Barony of Giffen, Barrmill. The moot hill <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> to Greenhill farm. This {{artificial}} mound was {{the site}} where proclamations of the Giffen Castle Baronial Court's judgements were made. No sign of the Moot hill seems to survive, however a bridge near to Greenhill is marked as 'Tappethillock', meaning a flat-topped hillock, which may refer to it.|$|E
25|$|Another temple <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> {{the circus}} Flaminius, vowed by consul Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in 187BC {{during the war}} against the Ligures and {{dedicated}} by himself as censor in 179 on December 23. It was connected by a porch with a temple of Fortuna, perhaps that of Fortuna Equestris. Its probable site according to Platner is just south of the porticus Pompeiana on the west end of circus Flaminius.|$|E
25|$|Native Americans {{were the}} first human {{visitors}} to Roan Mountain. A Catawba legend tells of a great battle with the Cherokee atop the mountain that left the rhododendron colored crimson {{and parts of the}} mountain treeless. While there is no hard evidence that such a battle ever occurred, numerous Native American settlements have been found {{around the base of the}} mountain, and the Cherokee settlement of Old Fields <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> modern-day Elizabethton, Tennessee.|$|E

25|$|Inside the Arsenal, the Spanish {{constructed}} a foundry, {{as well as}} other shops, which were necessary for the construction and repair of ships. The buildings were laid out in two rows on Rivera Point, a sandy patch of land jutting into the bay, and named after the incumbent Captain-General of the Philippines, Fernando Primo de Rivera. The Arsenal's showpiece was the station commandant's headquarters, which was a one-storey building of molave and narra, and <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> today's Alava Pier and had colored glass windows.|$|E
25|$|The wharf {{extended}} {{nearly a}} half mile into the bay. It was between 15 and 20 feet wide and came straight in over the mud and gravel beach at a height of 6 to 10 feet. At the wharf entrance, John Landers was talking with another man. About 60 feet down the wharf against the west railing, Josias Tanner and Jesse Murphy <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> each other. Frank Reid stood further on, alone. Their job was to identify Soap Gang members and prevent them from entering the meeting then in progress.|$|E
25|$|To {{decorate}} his own {{summer home}} on Lake Delton, Newman transported several sculptures and concrete blocks he saved {{from the rubble}} of Midway Gardens (1913, Chicago, Illinois; demolished 1929), the last of Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie Style buildings, which had <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> the Lake Michigan shoreline in downtown Chicago. Newman's company had been hired in 1929 to demolish the structure. Years later, when Wright heard of {{the survival of the}} sculptures and blocks, he purchased them and they remained with his estate. As recently as 1999, a block was found buried on the property of Newman's old summer home on Lake Delton and was donated to the Chicago Historical Society.|$|E

Both the 3rd Guards Army and the 13th Army {{were to be}} heavily reinforced throughout the battle, as {{they were to be}} {{in the path of the}} German break-out. A reinforcement of particular note was the deployment of the 1st Guards Breakthrough Artillery Division under the command of the 3rd Guards Army in the sector of Teurow to Briesen.|$|E
25|$|The other {{settlers}} {{rushed into}} the cabin as the raiding warriors surrounded the house. They {{shut the door and}} aimed their weapons through cracks in the walls. Two of the men <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> the doorway with their weapons, and Hodges' weapon came into contact with Girty's chest causing him, and his group, to retreat into the woods. Young Dimmick, anxious to the point of begging to leave, was then dispatched to Hennepin by horseback for help. The men at the cabin expected Dimmick to be shot as soon as he rode off, but he crossed the open prairie unscathed. Dimmick made the 16 mile (25.7km) journey and arrived in Hennepin to report the attack.|$|E
25|$|Pieštvė (also {{known as}} Beisten, Bisten, Pistene, Pista, Pestwa, etc. in medieval chronicles) was a wooden {{fortress}} of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania during the Lithuanian Crusade. It {{stood on a}} hill fort that is known as Palemon Hill in Seredžius, Jurbarkas District Municipality, Lithuania, located near {{the confluence of the}} Neman and Dubysa rivers. It was an important Lithuanian defensive outpost against the Teutonic Order. It was first mentioned in written sources in 1293 and attacked numerous times by the Order. Because it <b>stood</b> <b>near</b> Junigeda (Veliuona), both fortresses were often attacked together. It was burned down in 1363, a year following the fall of Kaunas Castle. It was rebuilt in May 1412 but lost its strategic importance after the Treaty of Melno (1422) and was abandoned. Earlier historians thought that Pieštvė was identical to Bisena.|$|E
