5|$|In 2010's {{video game}} , the Queen (voiced by Kyoko Satomi in Japanese and Susanne Blakeslee in English) {{appears in the}} Dwarf Woodlands world. She {{recruits}} the protagonist Terra to kill Snow White and bring back her heart in return for allowing him to use the Magic Mirror to locate Master Xehanort. Terra, like the huntsman, ultimately does not go through with this, and the Queen, learning of his betrayal, forces the Mirror to consume him, but Terra manages to fight the Mirror off and the Queen reluctantly gives him the information he looks for. She later appears briefly in Ventus's scenario, where <b>she</b> <b>crosses</b> paths with him {{on her way to}} poison Snow White. She drops the poisoned apple, which Ventus returns to her. She notices Ventus's Keyblade and muses that Terra threatened her with a similar weapon. She is then only briefly mentioned in Aqua's storyline, when the Magic Mirror tells Aqua that the Queen is dead and he is no longer under her control.|$|E

Pausing only to drink water and tend her paws, <b>she</b> <b>crosses</b> Pyramid Peak and swims across the Hungry Horse Reservoir, before a week without food and exhaustion cause her to collapse on the shore. After resting, she continues her run, though hunger now spurs her to pause to hunt when she can but she eventually collapses by Flathead Lake, where she remains unconscious for days. Meanwhile, unskilled at hunting and without the adults {{to teach them how}} to survive, Annie and Sula slowly starve to death. Oldtooth reaches Middle Fork Valley, where illness and his lame foot drive him to hunt local livestock. He is shot and killed by a human.|$|E
5|$|The meerkat Flower is {{born in the}} Kalahari Desert on March 15, 2000, to Holly, {{the leader}} of a meerkat group called the Whiskers. After an attack by a rival group, the Lazuli, the Whiskers are forced to {{surrender}} their territory and move to a new home. A hawk kills Holly when Flower is a year old, and her father abandons the group to find a new mate. Flower's sister Viale becomes the group's matriarch and chooses Youssarian, a roving male from the Lazuli, as her mate. Flower mates with Yossarian's brother, Zaphod, but Viale kills the resulting pups and banishes Flower from the group, allowing her to return later. During a time of starvation and drought, Viale attempts to lead the group across a road to forage. As <b>she</b> <b>crosses,</b> she is struck and killed by a passing truck. As the Whiskers attempt to adjust to the loss of their leader, a snake approaches the group. Flower steps in to lead an attack to drive it off. In doing so, she becomes the new leader of the group. Zaphod returns to the group to be her mate, while Yossarian steps aside and leaves the group. Flower leads the Whiskers back to their original home, and after a brief battle, the Whiskers reclaim it from the Lazuli. At end of the film, an on-screen note describes Flower's death during the third season of Meerkat Manor and the children she left behind.|$|E

25|$|John Ford hired Canutt on John Wayne's {{recommendation}} for Stagecoach, where Canutt supervised the river-crossing scene {{as well as}} the Indian chase scene, did the stagecoach drop, and doubled for Wayne in the coach stunts. For safety during the stagecoach drop stunt, Canutt devised modified yokes and tongues, to give extra handholds and extra room between the teams. Ford told him that whenever Ford made an action picture and Canutt wasn't working elsewhere, he was on Ford's payroll. Also in 1939, Canutt doubled Clark Gable in the burning of Atlanta in Gone With the Wind; he also appeared as a renegade accosting Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) as <b>she</b> <b>crosses</b> a bridge in a carriage driving through a shantytown.|$|E

Joe hesitates to accept {{out of concern for}} his agoraphobic wife Harper, who refuses to move. Harper suspects that Joe does not love her in the same way she loves him, which is confirmed when Joe confesses his homosexuality. Harper retreats into a drug-fueled escapist fantasy, including a dream where <b>she</b> <b>crosses</b> paths with Prior even though the two of them have never met in the real world. Joe's conservative mother Hannah arrives in New York, where she finds that in reality Harper has been wandering the streets of the city while Joe begins an affair with Louis. Denying her son's homosexuality, Hannah instead tries to force a reconciliation between Harper and Joe.|$|E

50|$|Maria Spelterini (sometimes spelled Spelterina and {{occasionally}} {{referred to as}} Marie, July 7, 1853 - October 19, 1912) was an Italian tightrope walker who {{was the only woman}} to cross the Niagara gorge on a tightrope, which she did on July 8, 1876 as part of a celebration of the U.S. Centennial. She used two and a quarter inch (57 mm) wire and crossed just north of the lower suspension bridge. <b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> again on July 12, 1876, this time wearing peach baskets strapped to her feet. <b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> blindfolded on July 19, and on July 22 <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> with her ankles and wrists manacled.|$|R
500|$|Wallraf-Richartz Museum's Langlois Bridge at Arles {{depicts a}} woman holding an {{umbrella}} as <b>she</b> <b>crosses</b> the Langlois Bridge, following {{a horse and}} buggy that just crossed the bridge. [...] The water in the canal subtly reflects the bridge and the few clouds in the sky. [...] Van Gogh uses impasto paint and color to reflect light, much as we would see it in with our eye. Two tall cypress trees and a white house flank the drawbridge which has a moveable center section between stone abutments. The painting is currently at the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne, Germany.|$|E
500|$|A {{professional}} cat burglar, grifter, and femme fatale who {{establishes a}} playful, teasing relationship with Bruce that [...] "takes {{some of the}} somberness away from his character", and pursues a [...] "clean slate" [...] (a computer program rumored {{to be able to}} erase a person's criminal history) when <b>she</b> <b>crosses</b> paths with both Bruce and Batman. Hathaway auditioned not knowing what role she was being considered for. Hathaway described the role as being the most physically demanding she had ever played, and confessed that while she thought of herself as being fit she had to redouble her efforts in the gym {{to keep up with the}} demands of the role. Hathaway trained extensively in martial arts for the role, and looked to Hedy Lamarr—who was the inspiration for Catwoman's character—in developing her performance.|$|E
500|$|Digital Spy's Lewis Corner {{gave the}} song a four (out of five)-star rating, and wrote that its {{production}} {{was of a}} [...] "summer anthem level". Corner said the track felt [...] "slightly lighter" [...] than Azalea's previous releases, adding: [...] "... but if it means <b>she</b> <b>crosses</b> over into superstardom territory, it's a job well done". While Robert Copsey of the same website believed that it [...] "felt like a somewhat needless moment of pop frivolity". Complex reviewers were also divided; Brian Josephs considered the track a [...] " [...] club banger", but David Drake criticized Azalea's [...] "nimble rapping and forced accent". According to Drake, [...] " [...] {{is the kind of}} thing that might work in the UK, where a digitally-animated frog once had a No. 1 hit with a cover of the theme to Beverly Hills Cop, but this will probably be a long shot at getting stateside club play". John Robinson of The Guardian felt it was [...] "second-division" [...] and [...] "sheeeeeit". Karen Lawler of Blues & Soul opined that it recalled [...] "a lost track" [...] from Miley Cyrus' 2013 album, Bangerz, and dismissed its [...] "nod" [...] to 2 Unlimited as [...] "cringe worthy". While Clash called [...] "Bounce" [...] an inferior version of [...] "No Limit" [...] and [...] "criminal in every way", and opined that it lacked tune; [...] "No Auto-Tune, though, because you need a tune to Auto".|$|E

2500|$|In another Verhoeven film—the erotic thriller Basic Instinct (1992)— {{she took}} on the role that made her a star, playing Catherine Tramell, a brilliant, bisexual, alleged serial killer. Several actresses at the time turned down the role, mostly because of the nudity required. In the film's most notorious scene, Tramell is being {{questioned}} by the police, and <b>she</b> <b>crosses</b> and uncrosses her legs, exposing her vulva, which is not covered by underwear. According to Stone, she agreed to film the flashing scene with no underwear, and although she and Verhoeven had discussed the scene {{from the beginning of}} production, she was unaware just how explicit the infamous shot would be: [...] "I knew {{that we were going to}} do this leg-crossing thing and I knew that we were going to allude to the concept that I was nude, but I did not think that you would see my vagina in the scene. Later, when I saw it in the screening I was shocked. I think seeing it in a room full of strangers was so disrespectful and so shocking, so I went into the booth and slapped him and left". Stone claimed in an earlier interview, however, that [...] "it was so fun" [...] watching the film for the first time with strangers. Verhoeven has denied all claims of trickery and said, [...] "As much as I love her, I hate her, too, especially after the lies she told the press about the shot between her legs, which was a straight lie". Screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, who later befriended the actress, also claimed in his memoir, Hollywood Animal, that the actress was fully aware of the level of nudity involved.|$|E
