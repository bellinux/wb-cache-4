5|$|At Lexington Avenue, NY92 {{begins to}} turn to the {{southeast}} as it heads through more residential areas of the city.

The route parallels the western edge of the freeway for <b>several</b> <b>blocks</b> to Westchester Avenue, where NY120 meets the southern end of NY120A, an alternate route through the easternmost part of Westchester County. While NY120A heads east toward Port Chester, NY120 takes on the Westchester Avenue name as the two directions of the route split to follow collector/distributor roads running northwestward along both sides of I-287. The route remains on the frontage roads for about a half-mile (0.8km) to another section of Purchase Street, where NY120 turns to follow a slightly more northward track through another residential section of Harrison.|$|E

5|$|NY174 {{has also}} had several minor realignments. After Route5 was realigned onto a new {{expressway}} from Camillus to Fairmount, NY174 was extended on its northern end to meet {{the west end of}} the bypass in Camillus. The new alignment makes a sharp hook west along the former Route5. NY174 has also been relocated onto a southeastern bypass around the village of Marcellus that also carries Route175. Originally, NY174 and175 entered the village along South Street. The routes were realigned to the bypass between 1976 and 1989. NY174 now enters downtown Marcellus using <b>several</b> <b>blocks</b> of the historic Seneca Turnpike between the old and new alignments. This section of the route is maintained by Onondaga County as CR41. The former South Street alignment has been redesignated as CR83.|$|E

NY481 approaches NY264 from the southeast, and the freeway loosely parallels the surface road as NY264 intersects the eastern terminus of CR59.
