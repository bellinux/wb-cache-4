40|$|Purpose. To {{develop the}} {{theoretical}} basis of electrical machines object-oriented design, mathematical models and software {{to improve their}} design synthesis, analysis and optimization. Methodology. We have applied object-oriented design theory in electric machines optimal design and mathematical modelling of electromagnetic transients and electromagnetic field distribution. We have correlated the simulated results with the experimental data obtained {{by means of the}} double-stator <b>screw</b> <b>dryer</b> with an external solid rotor, brushless turbo-generator exciter and induction motor with squirrel cage rotor. Results. We have developed object-oriented design methodology, transient mathematical modelling and electromagnetic field equations templates for cylindrical electrical machines, improved and remade Cartesian product and genetic optimization algorithms. This allows to develop electrical machines classifications models, included not only structure development but also parallel synthesis of mathematical models and design software, to improve electric machines efficiency and technical performance. Originality. For the first time, we have applied a new way of design and modelling of electrical machines, which is based on the basic concepts of the object-oriented analysis. For the first time is suggested to use a single class template for structural and system organization of electrical machines, invariant to their specific variety. Practical value. We have manufactured <b>screw</b> <b>dryer</b> for coil dust drying and mixing based on the performed object-oriented theory. We have developed object-oriented software for design and optimization of induction motor with squirrel cage rotor of AIR series and brushless turbo-generator exciter. The experimental studies have confirmed the adequacy of the developed object-oriented design methodology...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to know the influence of variation of comparative round hammer mill and <b>screw</b> conveyor flash <b>dryer</b> drying results and get the optimal comparison. This testing process using flash dryer by setting the comparison rounds hammer mill and screw conveyor in comparison with the 1 : 2, 1 : 2. 67 and 1 : 3. 33. With how to set magnitude of puli linking hammer mill and screw conveyor. Analisisa Results of this research show that the comparison rounds of screw conveyor and a hammer mill to comparison of incoming and outgoing flour flour. A comparison of the most optimum is 1 : 2, 23 on comparison of round 1 : 3. 33, with the lowest density, namely 368. 42 kg/m...|$|R
