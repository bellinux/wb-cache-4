5|$|In {{common with}} the other main island chains of Scotland {{many of the more}} remote islands were {{abandoned}} during the 19th and 20th centuries, in some cases after continuous habitation since prehistoric times.

5|$|However, it {{was soon}} {{revealed}} that the cannon had been appropriated by MIT {{in retaliation for the}} previous year's pranks, and relocated to Cambridge. The MIT team consisted of about 30 hackers, of which two flew to Pasadena and five drove cross-country. While acquiring the cannon disguised as construction contractors, the hackers had run-ins with a Caltech security guard and physical plant worker, to whom they explained that they were moving the cannon in preparation for the pouring of a concrete pedestal. Once off Caltech's campus, a local resident called in a noise complaint, and the Pasadena police arrived but did not recognize the then-disguised cannon. On the way to the shipping company, the trailer's hitch cracked, necessitating a slow trip on surface roads, and on arrival they were unable to physically remove the cannon from the trailer, causing them to spend an extra $1000 for the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> company that specialized in moving large film props.|$|E
5|$|Indirect mutualisms occur {{where the}} organisms live apart. For example, trees {{living in the}} {{equatorial}} regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called commensalism; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen. If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called parasitism. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or propagules, denying the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast. Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or {{among members of the}} same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The Red Queen Hypothesis, for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{actors in}} total have portrayed Bond on film. Following Connery's portrayal, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig have assumed the role. These screen {{versions}} have retained many traits from Fleming's depiction, {{although some of}} Bond's less fashionable attitudes have been dropped, such as racism, homophobia, retaining the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maid, and in the more recent films, smoking. Despite playing the same character, there have been notable differences among the portrayals. Daniel Craig is the incumbent Bond in the long-running Eon series, and played the part for a fourth time in the latest film, Spectre, released in October 2015. Daniel Craig will return as Bond in the 25th instalment of the series. The film is expected to release in 2019.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of Kent died quite {{suddenly}} in 1820, followed quickly by his father, King George III. Victoria's uncle, the Prince Regent, ascended the throne as King George IV. Victoria was now third {{in line to}} the throne, after her uncles the Duke of York and the Duke of Clarence, {{both of whom were}} well past middle age and neither of whom had legitimate heirs. As the likely eventual heir, Victoria had to be educated accordingly. Feodora was now 14, and no longer required the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> governess. After the dismissal of nursemaid Mrs. Brock, Lehzen – as she was always known in the household – took over five-year-old Victoria's care in 1824. The Duchess and her comptroller, John Conroy made the appointment not only because Lehzen was German (rather than English), but also because they believed she was unlikely to operate independently of their wishes.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, the Saudis spent $15 {{million to}} equip royalist tribes, hire {{hundreds}} of European mercenaries, and establish their own radio station. Pakistan, which saw {{a chance to}} make money in the conflict, extended rifles to the royalists. Remnants of the Imam's Army also had elements of the Saudi National Guard fight alongside its ranks. Iran subsidized royalist forces on and off, as the Shah felt compelled to provide al-Badr (a Zaidi) with financing. The British allowed convoys of arms to flow through one of its allies in Northern Yemen, the Sheriff of Beijan, who was protected by the British administration in Aden. British military planes conducted night operations to resupply al-Badr's forces. The MI6 was responsible for contacting the royalists, and used the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> private company belonging to Colonel David Stirling, founder of the Special Air Service (SAS), who recruited dozens of former SAS men as advisors to the royalists. Britain participated in a $400 million British air defense program for Saudi Arabia. The Lyndon Johnson administration was more willing than Kennedy's to support long-range plans in support of the Saudi army. In 1965, the US authorized an agreement with the Corps of Engineers to supervise the construction of military facilities and in 1966 it sponsored a $100 million program which provided the Saudi forces with combat vehicles, mostly trucks. Faisal also initiated an Islamic alignment called the Islamic Conference, to counter Nasser's Arab socialism.|$|E

5|$|Land {{transport}} {{utilized the}} advanced system of Roman roads. The in-kind taxes paid by communities included {{the provision of}} personnel, animals, or vehicles for the cursus publicus, the state mail and transport service established by Augustus. Relay stations were located along the roads every seven to twelve Roman miles, and tended to grow into a village or trading post. A mansio (plural mansiones) was a privately run service station franchised by the imperial bureaucracy for the cursus publicus. The support staff at such a facility included muleteers, secretaries, blacksmiths, cartwrights, a veterinarian, and a few military police and couriers. The distance between mansiones was determined by how far a wagon could travel in a day. Mules were the animal most often used for pulling carts, travelling about 4mph. As {{an example of the}} pace of communication, it took a messenger a minimum of nine days to travel to Rome from Mainz in the province of Germania Superior, even on a matter of urgency. In addition to the mansiones, some taverns offered accommodations as well as food and drink; one recorded tab for a stay showed charges for wine, bread, mule feed, and the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prostitute.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant met Groves and Oppenheimer in Washington, D.C., on 18 September 1943, {{and they}} {{attempted}} {{to persuade him to}} join the Los Alamos Laboratory, but Oliphant felt that he would be of more use assisting Lawrence on the electromagnetic project. Accordingly, the Technical Subcommittee directed that Oliphant and six assistants would go to Berkeley, and later move on to Los Alamos. Oliphant found that he and Lawrence had quite different designs, and that the American one was frozen, but Lawrence, who had expressed a desire for Oliphant to join him on the electromagnetic project as early as 1942, was eager for Oliphant's assistance. Oliphant secured the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fellow Australian physicist, Harrie Massey, who had been working for the Admiralty on magnetic mines, along with James Stayers and Stanley Duke, who had worked with him on the cavity magnetron. This initial group set out for Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator bomber in November 1943. Oliphant found that Berkeley had shortages of key skills, particularly physicists, chemists and engineers. He prevailed on Sir David Rivett, the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Australia, to release Eric Burhop to work on the project. His requests for personnel were met, and the British mission at Berkeley grew in number to 35, two of whom, Robin Williams and George Page, were New Zealanders.|$|E
5|$|The {{final mass}} test session {{before the new}} season {{took place at the}} track over 1–3 April.

An overnight sandstorm caused the second day's running to be delayed for one hour while circuit officials cleaned the track. Sergey Sirotkin was the fastest driver in the morning session with a lap of 1:41.797, and Nobuharu Matsushita recorded the quickest lap of the afternoon session with a time of 1:40.191. Pierre Gasly recorded the fastest lap time of the three days, a 1:39.632 in the morning session, and Nigel Melker was the quickest driver in the afternoon session with a lap of 1:41.566.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} the degree of knowledge among female Master of Business Administration students and Law students regarding image consulting services, to identify students likely to use the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> image consultant, and to identify perceived wardrobe needs of the students. Thirty-three business students and fifty-three law students were surveyed. For each survey question, the actual number of responses was calculated for business and law respondents, then the total number of responses from both groups was calculated. Percentage distribution was then calculated in a similar manner for each question. In general, it was found that only <b>a</b> small percentage <b>of</b> the entire population surveyed had knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> image consultant. Respondents likely to use the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> image consultant were those wishing to have help with their career appearance, help in determining appropriate clothes for career-related activities, or help in determining what styles looked best on their body type. Slightly more business students than law students seemed likely to use the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> image consultant, yet more of the law respondents had actually used the <b>services</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> image consultant. Business respondents had less <b>of</b> <b>an</b> implied dress code, and therefore these women wanted help in determining appropriate clothes for their careers...|$|R
