50|$|The {{ultimate}} strength of concrete {{is influenced by}} the water-cementitious ratio (w/cm), the design constituents, and the mixing, placement and curing methods employed. All things being equal, concrete with a lower water-cement (cementitious) ratio makes a stronger concrete than that with a higher ratio. The total quantity of cementitious materials (portland cement, slag cement, pozzolans) can affect strength, water demand, shrinkage, abrasion resistance and density. All concrete will crack independent of whether or not it has sufficient compressive strength. In fact, high Portland cement content mixtures can actually crack more readily due to increased hydration rate. As concrete transforms from its plastic state, hydrating to a solid, the material undergoes shrinkage. Plastic shrinkage cracks can occur soon after placement but if the evaporation rate is high they often can actually occur during finishing operations, for example in hot weather or a breezy day.In very high-strength concrete mixtures (greater than 70 MPa) the crushing strength of the aggregate can be a limiting factor to the ultimate compressive strength. In lean concretes (with a high water-cement ratio) the crushing strength of the aggregates is not so significant. The internal forces in common shapes of structure, such as arches, vaults, columns and walls are predominantly compressive forces, with floors and pavements subjected to tensile forces. Compressive strength is widely used for <b>specification</b> <b>requirement</b> and quality control of concrete. Engineers know their target tensile (flexural) requirements and will express these in terms of compressive strength.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Article 23 Directive 2004 / 18 {{requires}} that procuring entities formulate its standards ‘sufficiently precise’. This implies a <b>specification</b> <b>requirement</b> for government contracts. The question {{that remains is}} what {{the scope of the}} <b>specification</b> <b>requirement</b> is. In other words, how precise should a standard be formulated. The scope of the <b>specification</b> <b>requirement</b> should be interpreted {{in the light of the}} general principles of EC law and more particular Directive 2004 / 18. All products and services should be granted access to the common market and therefore accepted by the contract documents. Consequently, standards cannot be too specific as this would exclude a lot of products and services.

40|$|Haynes 282 is {{relatively}} new nickel base superalloy, offering excellent mechanical properties and attracting interest from the gas turbine and aerospace industry. One of the criteria for meeting <b>specification</b> <b>requirement</b> is the room temperature ductility. Forgings of Haynes 282 show large anisotropy in ductility, varying from approximately 25 % in longitudinal transverse (LT) to 12 % in the short transverse(ST) direction. In this paper LT and ST specimens from forgings were tested for its room temperature ductility. Fractographic and metallographic analysis show the presence of MC and Mc 6 C carbide banding. Failure in both ST and LT direction was ductile with intergranular fracture, but in the ST direction the failure was preferentially due to cracking of carbides. The orientation of carbides in preferred direction and their excessive segregation affecting ductility in ST is discussed in this work...|$|E
40|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{this paper}} to present a model {{conceived}} for supporting the initial, critical phases of PLC software life cycle, namely requirement <b>specification,</b> <b>requirement</b> analysis and software design, to obtain reusable code. The model, named EASIER, is based on an object-oriented paradigm where the message-method mechanism is replaced by the law and action primitives, since they are more suitable to cope with the real-time, cyclic nature of PLC software. Software re-usability is pursued by identifying independent control modules through a proper bedded encapsulation mechanism, representing system dynamics by means of synchronized state diagrams, expressing context-free behaviour of system components by introducing virtual objects. The EASIER approach is presently validated with respect to relevant reverse and forward engineering applications; from one of these cases we derive the examples used in the paper. 1 Introduction Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are widely used for [...] ...|$|E

This consists {{on the construction of}} a complete robotic system designed to assist users in a library, namely the UJI (i. e. the acronym of our University) librarian robot. During the last year new hardware and software has been necessary to improve the different skills required for this task. Thus we present new results achieved with this system, in particular those related to guide the extraction of a book on a shelf, now by using a hybrid control law, integrating force and visual servoing. At the same time, new results have been obtained improving the automatic book recognition process.
