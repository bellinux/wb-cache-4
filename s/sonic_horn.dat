The stability of the bismuth film to the application of ultrasound was assessed via voltammetric and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies which revealed little ablation at powers up to an intensity of 130 W cm(- 2) delivered from a 25 -kHz <b>sonic</b> <b>horn.</b> Furthermore, bismuth-film-modified glassy carbon electrodes were evaluated for the sonoelectroanalytical quantification of zinc and cadmium.

50|$|Sonic {{soot blowers}} are {{normally}} constructed from fabricated, 316 grade stainless steel {{as opposed to}} some <b>sonic</b> <b>horns</b> which are manufactured from heavy cast iron. For installations in harsher environments, such as high temperature or acidic gas streams, other types of stainless steels are used such as 310, 316 and 825.|$|R
50|$|Some baghouses have <b>sonic</b> <b>horns</b> {{installed}} {{to provide}} supplementary vibration cleaning energy. The horns, which generate high intensity, low frequency sounds waves, are turned on just before {{or at the}} start of the cleaning cycle to help break the bonds between particles on the filter media surface and aid in dust removal.|$|R
50|$|A further {{operational}} {{difficulty in}} coal-fired boilers is the binding of the catalyst by fly ash from the fuel combustion. This requires {{the usage of}} sootblowers, <b>sonic</b> <b>horns,</b> and careful design of the ductwork and catalyst materials to avoid plugging by the fly ash. SCR catalysts have a typical operational lifetime of about 16,000-40,000 hours in coal-fired power plants, depending on the flue gas composition, and up to 80,000 hours in cleaner gas-fired power plants.|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of the ferricyanide anion, [Fe(CN) 6] 3 -, was studied in aqueous solution at macro- and microelectrodes in the presence and absence of ultrasound directed onto the electrode surface from a <b>sonic</b> <b>horn</b> (20 kHz) located a short distance above it. Under conditions of insonation the reduction wave is seen to shift anodically when appropriate corrections for thermal effects are made. This is attributed to {{the reaction of the}} electrogenerated ferrocyanide anion with hydroxyl radicals, OH•, derived from the ultrasonically induced decomposition of the solvent, so that the electrode process is of the EC mechanistic type. This is confirmed by quantitative measurements of the potential shift {{as a function of the}} mean diffusion layer thickness as revealed by the magnitude of the transport limited current in the presence of ultrasound of constant power. © 1995 American Chemical Society...|$|E

40|$|Waste-to-energy boiler fire-side fouling {{is a major}} {{operational}} {{issue for}} many facilities, including the Commerce Refuse-to-Energy Facility. The Commerce Refuse-to-Energy Facility is a 350 ton per day, mass burn waterwall facility that began operation in 1987. Fouling occurs throughout the convection sections with the highest differential pressure occurring across the generating bank. Flue gas differential pressures and temperatures have been tracked and analyzed at the facility for approximately ten years during various operating conditions. It has been determined {{that the rate of}} increase of the differential pressure across the generating bank is correlated with flue gas temperature and the extent of fouling. Several different cleaning methods have been used to clear the convection zone of ash deposits, including off-line hydroblasting, on-line hydroblasting, on-line explosives cleaning, sootblowers and <b>sonic</b> <b>horns</b> [...] Better understanding of the fouling trends and evaluation of cleaning methods has led the facility to use a combination of on-line hydroblasting and explosives cleaning and off-line hydroblasting. The facility is now able to operate one year between planned outages, compared to ten weeks during the initial operation of the facility. Additional savings have also been achieved by reducing induced draft fan load, and possibly a reduction in tube wastage...|$|R
40|$|This {{final report}} {{presents}} and discusses {{results from a}} mercury control process development project entitled ''Pilot Testing of Mercury Oxidation Catalysts for Upstream of Wet FGD Systems''. The objective of this project was to demonstrate at pilot scale a mercury control technology that uses solid honeycomb catalysts to promote the oxidation of elemental mercury in the flue gas from coal combustion. Oxidized mercury is removed in downstream wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) absorbers and leaves with the FGD byproducts. The goal {{of the project was}} to achieve 90 % oxidation of elemental mercury in the flue gas and 90 % overall mercury capture with the downstream wet FGD system. The project was co-funded by EPRI and the U. S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE NETL) under Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 01 NT 41185. Great River Energy (GRE) and City Public Service (now CPS Energy) of San Antonio were also project co-funders and provided host sites. URS Group, Inc. was the prime contractor. Longer-term pilot-scale tests were conducted at two sites to provide catalyst life data. GRE provided the first site, at their Coal Creek Station (CCS), which fires North Dakota lignite, and CPS Energy provided the second site, at their Spruce Plant, which fires Powder River Basin (PRB) coal. Mercury oxidation catalyst testing began at CCS in October 2002 and continued through the end of June 2004, representing nearly 21 months of catalyst operation. An important finding was that, even though the mercury oxidation catalyst pilot unit was installed downstream of a high-efficiency ESP, fly ash buildup began to plug flue gas flow through the horizontal catalyst cells. <b>Sonic</b> <b>horns</b> were installed in each catalyst compartment and appeared to limit fly ash buildup. A palladium-based catalyst showed initial elemental mercury oxidation percentages of 95 % across the catalyst, declining to 67 % after 21 months in service. A carbon-based catalyst began with almost 98 % elemental mercury oxidation across the catalyst, but declined to 79 % oxidation after nearly 13 months in service. The other two catalysts, an SCR-type catalyst (titanium/vanadium) and an experimental fly-ash-based catalyst, were significantly less active. The palladium-based and SCR-type catalysts were effectively regenerated {{at the end of the}} long-term test by flowing heated air through the catalyst overnight. The carbon-based catalyst was not observed to regenerate, and no regeneration tests were conducted on the fourth, fly-ash-based catalyst. Preliminary process economics were developed for the palladium and carbon-based catalysts for a scrubbed, North Dakota lignite application. As described above, the pilot-scale results showed the catalysts could not sustain 90 % or greater oxidation of elemental mercury in the flue gas for a period of two years. Consequently, the economics were based on performance criteria in a later DOE NETL solicitation, which required candidate mercury control technologies to achieve at least a 55 % increase in mercury capture for plants that fire lignite. These economics show that if the catalysts must be replaced every two years, the catalytic oxidation process can be 30 to 40 % less costly than conventional (not chemically treated) activated carbon injection if the plant currently sells their fly ash and would lose those sales with carbon injection. If the plant does not sell their fly ash, activated carbon injection was estimated to be slightly less costly. There was little difference in the estimated cost for palladium versus the carbon-based catalysts. If the palladium-based catalyst can be regenerated to double its life to four years, catalytic oxidation process economics are greatly improved. With regeneration, the catalytic oxidation process shows over a 50 % reduction in mercury control cost compared to conventional activated carbon injection for a case where the plant sells its fly ash. At Spruce Plant, mercury oxidation catalyst testing began in September 2003 and continued through the end of April 2005, interrupted only by a host unit outage in late February/early March 2005. With a baghouse upstream of the catalysts, <b>sonic</b> <b>horns</b> did not appear to be necessary and were never installed. Pressure drop across the four catalysts remained low. Catalyst activity for elemental mercury oxidation was difficult to evaluate at this site. It was found that the baghouse effectively oxidized elemental mercury in the flue gas, with the baghouse outlet flue gas averaging 81 % mercury oxidation. This oxidation resulted in little elemental mercury remaining in the flue gas going to the oxidation catalyst pilot unit. In many instances, catalyst outlet elemental mercury concentrations were near detection limits for the measurement methods employed, so mercury oxidation percentages across the catalyst were uncertain...|$|R
