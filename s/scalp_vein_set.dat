40|$|Summary: We {{present an}} unusual {{case of a}} <b>scalp</b> <b>vein</b> de-tected by using {{angiography}} of the internal carotid artery. The vein arose from the superior sagittal sinus and drained into the deep posterior cervical vein via the parietal emis-sary <b>vein.</b> This <b>scalp</b> <b>vein</b> may be a collateral pathway for venous sinuses; however, the patient had no evidence of venous sinus occlusive disease or intracranial hypertension. Under normal conditions, opacification of <b>scalp</b> <b>veins</b> on internal carotid angiograms is very un-usual (1, 2). A <b>scalp</b> <b>vein</b> {{may be seen as}} an im-portant collateral pathway in the presence of ve-nous sinus compromise caused by various disorders such as parasagittal meningiomas (2) or venous si-nus thrombosis (3, 4). We describe an unusual case of visualization of a <b>scalp</b> <b>vein</b> by angiography of the internal carotid artery that did not result in compromised flow within the intracranial venous sinuses. Case Report A 75 -year-old woman was referred to our institution with a diagnosis of internal carotid artery aneurysm detected using MR angiography. Her history was unremarkable except for treatment by her local physician for systemic lupus erythe-matosus 10 years earlier. The neurologic examination showed no abnormalities. Angiography of the internal carotid angiog-raphy showed a saccular aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery bifurcation and a well-defined <b>scalp</b> <b>vein</b> (Fig 1). The <b>scalp</b> <b>vein</b> originated from the superior sagittal sinus and drained into the right, deep, posterior cervical vein via the parietal emissary vein.

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{describe}} the neuroradiologic findings in a 7 -year-old boy with anomalous intracranial venous drainage and cerebral calcification. CT scans demonstrated that his scalp mass was a plexus of <b>scalp</b> <b>veins</b> filled through the emissary foramen, {{and there were}} cerebral calcifications. Angiography revealed bilateral sigmoid sinus atresia {{with most of the}} intracranial venous drainage via the prominent mastoid emissary <b>veins</b> into dilated <b>scalp</b> <b>vein.</b> The possible relationship between cerebral calcification and anomalous intracranial venous drainage is discussed. Normally, most of the cerebral venous drainage collectsultimately into the transverse and sigmoid sinuses of the skull base, and the pathway from the dural sinuses of the pos-terior fossa into the internal jugular veins is anatomically ob-vious through the jugular foramen and numerous connec-tions with the vertebral plexus. 1, 2 In this article, we present a very rare case of bilateral sig-moid sinus atresia with most of the cerebral venous drainage through the prominent mastoid emissary vein to a plexus of dilated <b>scalp</b> <b>veins,</b> presenting as a posterior auricular mas...|$|R

40|$|Herein {{we report}} our {{experience}} with a simple technique for reducing the rate of silicone tube extrusion after nasolacrimal duct (NLD) intubation for congenital NLD obstruction. Medical records of children older than 2 years, with or without history of failed probing, who had undergone NLD intubation with a Crawford silicone tube {{over a period of}} 4 years were reviewed. In all subjects, one end of the Crawford tube was passed through a piece of <b>scalp</b> <b>vein</b> tubing followed by applying one or two knots. All Crawford tubes were removed after 3 months. Main outcome measures included complications such as tube extrusion, nasal discharge, crust formation and pyogenic granuloma formation. Fifty-seven patients, including 49 unilateral and 8 bilateral cases with mean age of 3. 8 Î 1. 6 (range, 2 to 11. 5) years were operated. No complications such as tube dislodgement, significant nasal discharge, crust or pyogenic granuloma formation occurred prior to Crawford tube removal. All silicone tubes were successfully removed from the nasal cavity.

40|$|AbstractNorthern Sweden is {{currently}} experiencing active exploration within a new gold ore province, {{the so called}} Gold Line, situated southwest of the well-known Skellefte VMS District. The largest known deposit in the Gold Line is the hypozonal FÃ¤boliden orogenic gold deposit. Mineralization at FÃ¤boliden is hosted by arsenopyrite-rich quartz veins, in a reverse, mainly dip-slip, high-angle shear zone, in amphibolite facies supracrustal host rocks. The timing of mineralization is estimated, from field relationships, at ca. 1. 8 Ga. The gold mineralization is hosted by two sets of mineralized quartz veins, one steep faultâfill <b>vein</b> <b>set</b> and one relatively flat-lying extensional <b>vein</b> <b>set.</b> Ore shoots occur at the intersections between the two <b>vein</b> <b>sets,</b> and both sets could have been generated from the same stress field, during the late stages of the Svecofennian orogen. The tectonic evolution during the 1. 9 â 1. 8 Ga Svecofennian orogen is complex, as features typical of {{both internal and external}} orogens are indicated. The similarity in geodynamic setting between the contemporary Svecofennian and Trans-Hudson orogens indicates a potential for world-class orogenic gold provinces also in the Svecofennian domain.

Quantification of the vertical persistence of fractures shows that Sheep Mountain and Rattlesnake Mountain differ by the vertical persistence of the pre-folding Laramide <b>vein</b> <b>sets,</b> which are strictly bed-confined in Sheep Mountain but cut across bedding at Rattlesnake Mountain, whereas the syn-folding veins are through-going in both. The emplacement chronology and the various sources of the fluids responsible for the paragenetic sequence are based on isotope chemistry and fluid inclusions analysis of the matrix and vein cements. At Sheep Mountain and Rattlesnake Mountain, the cements related to the burial are characterized by isotopic signatures of marine formation waters that were diluted during the karstification of the Madison Platform at the end of Mississippian. Meteoric fluids, presumably migrating during the Cenomanian from Wind River Range and Teton Range, recharge zones located in the south-west of the Bighorn Basin, were remobilized in the early bed-confined and through-going syn-folding veins of the Sheep Mountain Anticline. The former <b>vein</b> <b>set</b> drained only local fluids whose isotopic signature relates to an increase of temperature of the meteoric fluids during their migration, whereas the latter set allowed quick drainage of basinal fluids.
