Median concentrations for formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, propanal, MEK and butanal were observed to be 1. 5, 0. 67, 1. 9, 0. 072, 0. 22 and 0. 041 ppb respectively. The highest carbonyl concentrations were observed with trans-boundary transport associated with airmasses that passed over Michigan and Illinois {{and could have}} originated from the Ohio Valley. Local ozone sensitivity was established using the HCHO/NO 2 ratio and this area {{was found to be}} sensitive to both VOCs and NOx. Carbonyls accounted for 35 % of O 3 formation estimated using the MIR scale. Lake breeze events had no significant impact on carbonyl concentrations in this location. In the second part of this dissertation, aerosol concentrations and composition were obtained along the coast of California using a High-Resolution Time-of-Flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-AMS) onboard RV Atlantis during CalNex in 2010. Measured submicron aerosols were dominated by particulate sulfate and particulate organic matter (pOM), which accounted for 86 % of all measured submicron aerosol mass. High aerosol concentrations were associated with land breezes from polluted cities while low concentrations were observed with sea breezes. For the first time, a method is proposed to establish non-refractory particulate chloride (NR p-Cl) in ambient air that is enriched with sea salt chloride. This method involves the subtraction of refractory chloride signal (RF HxCl+), which was estimated using the HxCl+ (total chloride signal) to Na 35 Cl+ ratio in artificially generated sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosols.</b> Also for the first time, a method is proposed to determine percentage chloride depletion in ambient aerosols using HR-AMS measurements of Na+ and Na 35 Cl+.

We outline here a proposal for three coordinated climate modeling experiments to test aspects of sea spray geoengineering, to be conducted {{under the auspices of the}} Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP). The first, highly idealized, experiment (G 1 ocean-albedo) involves a uniform increase in ocean albedo to offset an instantaneous quadrupling of CO 2 concentrations from preindustrial levels. Results from a single climate model show an increased land-sea temperature contrast, Arctic warming, and large shifts in annual mean precipitation patterns. The second experiment (G 4 cdnc) involves increasing cloud droplet number concentration in all low-level marine clouds to offset some of the radiative forcing of an RCP 4. 5 scenario. This experiment will test the robustness of models in simulating geographically heterogeneous radiative flux changes and their effects on climate.

40|$|Knowledge of the {{physical}} characteristics and chemical composition of marine organic aerosols is needed for the quantification of their effects on solar radiation transfer and cloud processes. Global emission estimates of marine organic aerosol are {{in a range of}} 2 to 70 Tg yr− 1 and occur over regions most susceptible to aerosol perturbations. This review examines research pertinent to the chemical composition, size distribution, mixing state, emission mechanism, and climatic impact of marine primary organic aerosols associated with sea spray. Numerous measurements have shown that both the ambient mass concentration of marine organic aerosol and size-resolved organic mass fraction of sea spray aerosol are related to surface ocean biological activity. Recent studies have also indicated that fine mode (smaller than 200 nm in diameter) marine organic aerosols can have a size distribution independent from sea-salt, while coarse mode aerosols (larger than 1000 nm in diameter) {{are more likely to be}} internally-mixed with sea-salt. Climate studies have found that marine organic aerosols can cause large local increases in the cloud condensation nuclei concentration, with the potential to have a non-negligible influence on the anthropogenic aerosol indirect forcing. Despite these signs of climate-relevance for marine organic aerosols, the source strength, chemical composition, mixing state, hygroscopicity, cloud droplet activation potential, atmospheric aging, and removal of marine organic aerosols remain poorly quantified.

40|$|Sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosols</b> are an {{important}} part of the climate system through their direct and indirect effects. Due to the diminishing sea ice, the Arctic Ocean is one of the most rapidly changing sea spray aerosol source areas. However, the influence of these changes on primary particle production is not known. In laboratory experiments we examined the influence of Arctic Ocean water temperature, salinity and oxygen saturation on primary particle concentration characteristics. Sea water temperature was identified as the most important of these parameters. A strong decrease in sea spray aerosol production with increasing water temperature was observed for water temperatures between &minus; 1 &deg;C and 9 &deg;C. Aerosol number concentrations decreased from at least 1400 cm&minus; 3 to 350 cm&minus; 3 . In general, the aerosol number size distribution exhibited a robust shape with one mode close to Dp 0. 2 &mu;m with approximately 45 % of particles at smaller sizes. Changes in sea water temperature did not result in pronounced change of the shape of the aerosol size distribution, only in the magnitude of the concentrations. Our experiments indicate that changes in aerosol emissions are most likely linked to changes of the physical properties of sea water at low temperatures. The observed strong dependence of sea spray aerosol concentrations on sea water temperature, with a large fraction of the emitted particles in the typical cloud condensation nuclei size range, provide strong arguments for a more careful consideration of this effect in climate models...|$|E
40|$|A new {{sea spray}} source {{function}} (SSSF), termed Oceanflux Sea <b>Spray</b> <b>Aerosol</b> or OSSA, was derived based on in-situ sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> measurements along with meteorological/physical parameters. Submicron sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> fluxes derived from {{particle number concentration}} measurements at the Mace Head coastal station, {{on the west coast}} of Ireland, were used together with open-ocean eddy correlation flux measurements from the Eastern Atlantic Sea Spray, Gas Flux, and Whitecap (SEASAW) project cruise. In the overlapping size range, the data for Mace Head and SEASAW were found to be in a good agreement, which allowed deriving the new SSSF from the combined dataset spanning the dry diameter range from 15 nm to 6 μm. The OSSA source function has been parameterized in terms of five lognormal modes and the Reynolds number instead of the more commonly used wind speed, thereby encapsulating important influences of wave height, wind history, friction velocity, and viscosity. This formulation accounts for the different flux relationships associated with rising and waning wind speeds since these are included in the Reynolds number. Furthermore, the Reynolds number incorporates the kinematic viscosity of water, thus the SSSF inherently includes dependences on sea surface temperature and salinity. The temperature dependence of the resulting SSSF {{is similar to that of}} other in-situ derived source functions and results in lower production fluxes for cold waters and enhanced fluxes from warm waters as compared with SSSF formulations that do not include temperature effects. ©Author(s) 2014...|$|R
40|$|The aerosol in {{the coastal}} {{environment}} consists of a complicated mixture of anthropogenic and rural aerosol generated over land, and sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol.</b> Also, particles are generate dover sea by physical and chemical processes and the chemical composition may change due to condensation/evaporation of gaseous materials. The actual composition {{is a function of}} air mass history and fetch. At the land-sea transition the continental sources cease to exist, and thus the concentrations of land-based particles and gases will gradually decrease. At the same time, sea spray is generated due to the interaction between wind and waves in a developing wave field. A very intense source for sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> is the surf zone. Consequently, the aerosol transported over sea in off-shore winds will abruptly charge at the land-sea transition and then gradually loose its continental character, while also the contribution of the surf-generated aerosol will decrease.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an inorganic sea spray source function that is based upon state-of-the-art measurements of sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> production using a temperature-controlled plunging jet sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> chamber. The size-resolved particle production was measured between 0. 01 and 10 μm dry diameter. Particle production decreased non-linearly with increasing seawater temperature (between − 1 and 30 °C) similar to previous findings. In addition, we observed that the particle effective radius, {{as well as the}} particle surface, particle volume and particle mass, increased with increasing seawater temperature due to increased production of particles with dry diameters greater than 1 μm. By combining these measurements with the volume of air entrained by the plunging jet we have determined the size-resolved particle flux as a function of air entrainment. Through the use of existing parameterisations of air entrainment as a function of wind speed, we were subsequently able to scale our laboratory measurements of particle production to wind speed. By scaling in this way we avoid some of the difficulties associated with defining the "white area" of the laboratory whitecap – a contentious issue when relating laboratory measurements of particle production to oceanic whitecaps using the more frequently applied whitecap method. The here-derived inorganic sea spray source function was implemented in a Lagrangian particle dispersion model (FLEXPART – FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model). An estimated annual global flux of inorganic sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> of 5. 9 ± 0. 2 Pg yr − 1 was derived that is close to the median of estimates from the same model using a wide range of existing sea spray source functions. When using the source function derived here, the model also showed good skill in predicting measurements of Na + concentration at a number of field sites further underlining the validity of our source function. In a final step, the sensitivity of a large-scale model (NorESM – the Norwegian Earth System Model) to our new source function was tested. Compared to the previously implemented parameterisation, a clear decrease of sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> number flux and increase in aerosol residence time was observed, especially over the Southern Ocean. At the same time an increase in aerosol optical depth due to {{an increase in the number}} of particles with optically relevant sizes was found.

Aerosol distributions were measured on the Acqua Alta platform located 15 km {{off the coast of}} Venice using two Particle Measuring System probes and a chemical characterization was made using an Ion Chromatography analysis (IC). Our aim is to study both the sea-spray contribution and the anthropogenic influence in the coastal aerosol of this Mediterranean region.

For air masses of marine origin transported by southern winds on the French coast and by the Sirocco in the Adriatic, we note a good agreement between the concentrations of super-micrometer aerosols measured in the two locations. This indicates a similar sea surface production of sea-spray aerosols formed by bubble bursting processes in the two locations. In contrast, the results show larger concentrations of submicron {{particles in}} the North-Western Mediterranean compared to the Adriatic, which result probably from a larger anthropogenic background for marine conditions. In contrast, for a coastal influence, the chemical analysis presented in the present paper seems to indicate a larger importance of the anthropogenic impact in the Northern Adriatic compared to the North-Western Mediterranean...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{there exists}} {{a great deal of}} {{uncertainty}} regarding atmospheric aerosols and the role that they play within the Earth’s atmosphere. It is known that atmospheric aerosols can {{play a role in the}} Earth’s climate by scattering and absorbing solar radiation or acting as a cloud condensation nuclei. The purpose of this work is to obtain an improved understanding of the chemistry of atmospheric aerosols to better determine their impacts the environment, air quality, and climate. This work revolves around one specific type of atmospheric aerosol, i. e. sea spray aerosol. Sea spray aerosol is generated via breaking waves, through wind-driven mechanisms. Ocean water covers roughly 71 % of the Earth’s surface, and from this over 1300 Tg of sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosols</b> is emitted into the atmosphere every year. However, until recently, the study of sea spray was very challenging and often inconclusive due to the inability to filter background particles out. In this work, the understanding of sea spray aerosol is progressed by taking a two-pronged approach. First, this work focuses on the study of model systems of simple ocean surfactants and NaCl and the change in chemistry that occurs when the two are in the presence of each other. Second, sea spray samples generated during a biological bloom are isolated and analyzed. Using this two pronged approach, it is shown that model systems can provide supporting evidence for hypotheses created from trends discovered in more complex samples. Finally, common aerosol generation, storage, and analysis techniques are studied in order to improve our understanding of their effects on aerosol particles...|$|E

This paper evaluates a new method to calculate lidar ratio of sea spray aerosol using two independent sources: the AOD from Synergized Optical Depth of Aerosols (SODA) and the integrated attenuated backscatter from CALIOP. The method applied in this study allows particulate lidar ratio to be calculated for individual CALIOP retrievals of single aerosol layer columns over the ocean. Analyses are carried out using CALIOP level 2, 5 km sea spray aerosol layer products and collocated SODA nighttime data from December 2007 to December 2009. The global mean lidar ratio for sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosols</b> was found to be 26 sr, roughly 30 higher than the one prescribed by CALIOP. Data analysis also showed considerable spatiotemporal variability in calculated lidar ratio over different parts of the remote oceans. The calculated aerosol lidar ratios are shown to be inversely related to the mean ocean surface wind speed: increase in ocean surface wind speed (U 10) from 0 to 15 ms- 1 reduces the mean lidar ratios for sea spray particles from 32 sr (for 0 U 10 4 ms- 1) to 22 sr (for U 10 15 ms- 1). Such changes in the lidar ratio are expected to have a corresponding effect on sea spray AOD.

40|$|Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are {{man-made}} chemicals {{which have}} been observed in the global environment, even in locations far away from where they are emitted. These persistent substances are taken up in humans and biota and may have toxic effects. Knowledge about how PFAAs are dispersed in the environment is needed to discern strategies to manage their sources and to evaluate the efficacy of adopted legislation. This thesis aimed to increase {{our understanding of the}} sources of PFAAs to the atmosphere and how PFAAs are transported in air. The results of Paper I demonstrated that gaseous perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) sorbs to typical glass fibre filters (GFFs) used in high-volume air sampling of PFAAs. As a consequence, the fraction of gaseous PFOA present in sampled air is underestimated, while the fraction of PFOA associated with aerosols is overestimated. Replacing GFFs with filters deactivated through silanisation and siliconisation did not eliminate this sampling artefact and is therefore not recommended as a means to determine the gas-particle partitioning of PFAAs. In Paper II, monitoring of the mass of PFOA transferred from water solutions of pH 0. 2 - 5. 5 demonstrated that the acid dissociation constant of linear PFOA and the four most ubiquitous branched PFOA isomers is around or below 1. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the presence of counter ions and organic matter in water retarded, rather than enhanced, the volatilisation of PFOA. Therefore, volatilisation of all isomers of PFOA from environmental waters is expected to be negligible. To further study the transfer of PFAAs from environmental waters to air, Paper III simulated the process of sea spray generation in the laboratory. Strong enrichment of PFAAs was observed from bulk water to the surface microlayer and to aerosols. The enrichment increased with PFAA chain length, indicating that this process is of greater importance for more surface active substances. The highest enrichment was observed in aerosols < 1. 6 µm, which can travel over long distances if not rained out. Based on the measured aerosol enrichment factors we estimated that approximately 70 metric tonnes of PFAAs are aerosolised from the global oceans yearly and that 3 % of this mass is deposited in terrestrial environments. Paper IV reported the occurrence of branched PFOA isomers in deposition sampled in five geographical locations. The presence of these isomers demonstrated that atmospheric transformation of fluorotelomer alcohols is not the only ongoing source of PFAAs to air. We hypothesised that, additionally, both sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosols</b> and direct emissions from manufacturing sources contributed to the contamination of the precipitation on different spatial scales. Although further research is required to determine the relative importance of different sources to the atmosphere locally and globally, this thesis has substantially advanced the state-of-the-science by i) demonstrating the significance of an air sampling artefact discussed as an uncertainty in the scientific literature over the past decade, ii) definitively ruling out volatilisation from environmental waters as a source of PFOA to air, iii) demonstrating transfer of PFAAs from seawater to air via sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosols</b> and thus quantifying the environmental importance of this process, and iv) ultimately demonstrating that several types of sources of PFAAs impact the global atmosphere and thus PFAA contamination patterns in precipitation.

This is in broad agreement with other recent estimates of the source function over this size range but shows a more rapid decrease with size above R 80 = 2 μm than most other functions. The measurements were made during a 3 week cruise in the North Atlantic {{as part of the}} UK contribution to the international Surface Ocean-Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS) program. They utilized the new high-rate Compact Lightweight Aerosol Spectrometer Probe (CLASP), providing a 16 -channel size spectrum (0. 17 < R amb < 9. 5 μm) at 10 Hz, collocated with a sonic anemometer. The measurements demonstrate the high variability in sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosol</b> flux compared with other air-sea fluxes, both between individual estimates and in the scales contributing to the flux...|$|R

40|$|Sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosols</b> (SSAs) {{impact the}} {{particle}} mass concentration and gas-particle partitioning in coastal environments, with implications for human and ecosystem health. Model evaluations of SSA emissions have mainly {{focused on the}} global scale, but regional-scale evaluations are also important due to the localized impact of SSAs on atmospheric chemistry near the coast. In this study, SSA emissions in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model were updated to enhance the fine-mode size distribution, include sea surface temperature (SST) dependency, and reduce surf-enhanced emissions. Predictions from the updated CMAQ model {{and those of the}} previous release version, CMAQv 5. 0. 2, were evaluated using several coastal and national observational data sets in the continental US. The updated emissions generally reduced model underestimates of sodium, chloride, and nitrate surface concentrations for coastal sites in the Bay Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (BRACE) near Tampa, Florida. Including SST dependency to the SSA emission parameterization led to increased sodium concentrations in the southeastern US and decreased concentrations along parts of the Pacific coast and northeastern US. The influence of sodium on the gas-particle partitioning of nitrate resulted in higher nitrate particle concentrations in many coastal urban areas due to increased condensation of nitric acid in the updated simulations, potentially affecting the predicted nitrogen deposition in sensitive ecosystems. Application of the updated SSA emissions to the California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change (CalNex) study period resulted in a modest improvement in the predicted surface concentration of sodium and nitrate at several central and southern California coastal sites. This update of SSA emissions enabled a more realistic simulation of the atmospheric chemistry in coastal environments where marine air mixes with urban pollution...|$|E
40|$|Water uptake {{refers to}} the ability of {{atmospheric}} particles to take up water vapour from the surrounding atmosphere. This is an important property that affects particle size and phase and therefore influences many characteristics of aerosols relevant to air quality and climate. However, the water uptake properties of many important atmospheric aerosol systems, including those related to the oceans, are still not fully understood. Therefore, the primary aim of this PhD research program was to investigate the water uptake properties of marine aerosols. In particular, the effect of organics on marine aerosol water uptake was investigated. Field campaigns were conducted at remote coastal sites on the east coast of Australia (Agnes Water; March-April 2007) and west coast of Ireland (Mace Head; June 2007), and laboratory measurements were performed on bubble-generated sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosols.</b> A combined Volatility-Hygroscopicity-Tandem Differential Mobility Analyser (VH-TDMA) was employed in all experiments. This system probes the changes in the hygroscopic properties of nanoparticles as volatile organic components are progressively evaporated. It also allows particle composition to be inferred from combined volatility-hygroscopicity measurements. Frequent new particle formation and growth events were observed during the Agnes Water campaign. The VH-TDMA was used to investigate freshly nucleated particles (17 - 22. 5 nm) and {{it was found that the}} condensation of sulphate and/or organic vapours was responsible for driving particle growth during the events. Aitken mode particles (~ 40 nm) were also measured with the VH-TDMA. In 3 out of 18 VH-TDMA scans evaporation of a volatile, organic component caused a very large increase in hygroscopicity that could only be explained by an increase in the absolute water uptake of the particle residuals, and not merely an increase in their relative hygroscopicity. This indicated the presence of organic components that were suppressing the hygroscopic growth of mixed particles on the timescale of humidification in the VH-TDMA (6. 5 secs). It was suggested that the suppression of water uptake was caused by either a reduced rate of hygroscopic growth due to the presence of organic films, or organic-inorganic interactions in solution droplets that had a negative effect on hygroscopicity. Mixed organic-inorganic particles were rarely observed by the VH-TDMA during the summer campaign conducted at Mace Head. The majority of particles below 100 nm in clean, marine air appeared to be sulphates neutralised to varying degrees by ammonia. On one unique day, 26 June 2007, particularly large concentrations of sulphate aerosol were observed and identified as volcanic emissions from Iceland. The degree of neutralisation of the sulphate aerosol by ammonia was calculated by the VH-TDMA and found to compare well with the same quantity measured by an aerosol mass spectrometer. This was an important verification of the VH-TMDA‘s ability to identify ammoniated sulphate aerosols based on the simultaneous measurement of aerosol volatility and hygroscopicity. A series of measurements were also conducted on sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosols</b> generated from Moreton Bay seawater samples in a laboratory-based bubble chamber. Accumulation mode sea spray particles (38 - 173 nm) were found to contain only a minor organic fraction (< 10 %) that had little effect on particle hygroscopicity. These results are important because previous studies have observed that accumulation mode sea spray particles are predominantly organic (~ 80 % organic mass fraction). The work presented here suggests that this is not always the case, and that there may be currently unknown factors that are controlling the transfer of organics to the aerosol phase during the bubble bursting process. Taken together, the results of this research program have significantly improved our understanding of organic-containing marine aerosols and the way they interact with water vapour in the atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Aerosols can {{influence}} the {{chemistry of the atmosphere}} as well as also impact global climate by directly scattering light and modifying cloud properties. Sea <b>spray</b> <b>aerosols</b> (SSA) are the second most abundant natural aerosol globally and have the potential to strongly influence atmospheric chemistry and scattering of solar radiation in marine regions. In this dissertation, an ATOFMS was utilized to characterize the chemistry of SSA, focusing on describing the mixing state of the population and also distributions of chemical components within particles. Existing paradigms describing SSA via single particle mass spectrometers (SPMS) were expanded upon and SPMS descriptions of SSA with results from offline spectromicroscopy and quantitative ensemble techniques were unifed. This research was facilitated by {{the development of a new}} SPMS data analysis toolkit, which enabled both script-based and visual data exploration all within a single programming environment. Utilizing this toolkit, ATOFMS depth profiling studies of supermicron SSA illustrated that much of the variation in SSA mass spectral signatures is likely due to inconsistent desorption of particles with core-shell morphologies, helping to unify online and offline descriptions of the SSA mixing state. In a study of SSA generated from a model seawater solution, the interpretation of single particle ion signatures were informed by complimentary offline microscopy images and quantitative chemical composition measurements. It was deduced that the high calcium signal and total negative ion yield were likely a product of the coordination of calcium to carboxylate in the desorbed and ionized particle. For the first time, depth profiling and size dependence analyses were coupled to isolate likely microbial ion signatures (BioSS) from within the SSA population. These new paradigms were applied to interpret SSA ATOFMS data sets from collaborative studies, where the influence of biologically mediated changes in seawater chemistry on SSA chemistry and climate impacts were explored. Concentrations of BioSS and warm ice nucleating particles were correlated, suggesting microbe-containing SSA may effectively nucleate ice in marine clouds. Finally, ATOFMS and aerosol mass spectrometry descriptions of SSA helped establish a mechanistic framework illustrating how SSA chemical composition is modulated not only by phytoplankton primary production but also by microbial degradation processes...|$|E
