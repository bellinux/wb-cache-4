500|$|The {{trial was}} Captain Fabbroni's finest moment. He testified in 21 {{hearings}} and his testimony filled 285 pages. He accused the police, politicians {{and even the}} judiciary of being involved with the Camorra. Alfano claimed he was innocent. [...] "I am the victim of yellow journalism," [...] he told the judge. [...] "I have been ruined by the Carabinieri. The <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have been {{the head of the}} Camorra is a legend. I was neither its head nor its tail. I admit that I have committed some excesses. What youth of my social class in Naples has not?" ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2011, Jenkins {{exited the}} project, citing [...] "creative differences". She stated, [...] "I {{have had a}} great time working at Marvel. We parted on very good terms, and I look forward to working with them again." [...] Jenkins felt she could not have made a good film [...] "out of Thor 2 because I wasn’t the right director... I could have made a great Thor if I could have done the <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was wanting to do. But I don’t think I was the right person to make a great Thor out of the story they wanted to do." [...] Jenkins had {{intended}} to create a film based on the premise of Romeo and Juliet, where Jane was stuck on Earth with Thor forbidden to come save her. After Thor eventually does travel to Earth, he and Jane would have discovered that Malekith was [...] "hiding the dark energy inside of Earth because he knows that Odin doesn't care about Earth, and so he's using Odin's disinterest in Earth to trick him." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver {{hinted that}} she'd be {{interested}} in returning {{to the role of}} Ripley, stating that Resurrection's ending [...] "feels incomplete to me. I wish it didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>i</b> think would be satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers that I can think of that I would want to entrust this to." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{he retired}} in December 2004, the AP News Service quoted Moyers as saying, [...] "I'm going out telling the <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think is the biggest story of our time: how the right-wing media has become a {{partisan}} propaganda arm of the Republican National Committee. We have an ideological press that's interested in the election of Republicans, and a mainstream press that's interested in the bottom line. Therefore, we don't have a vigilant, independent press whose interest is the American people." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{her parents}} {{took her to}} see the West End {{production}} of Les Misérables for her thirteenth birthday, [...] "that's when I knew I {{wanted to be on}} the stage." [...] Although she had not discovered her vocal ability until she was at college and had started working, Ellis cites her early influences as Liza Minnelli, Elaine Paige and Barbra Streisand; their music she would sing in her bedroom much to the disturbance of her older brother Andrew, now a keen fisherman. She has explained that fellow musical theatre actress Ruthie Henshall inspired her growing up: [...] " [...] was a success story from Suffolk … I think I identified with her because it was an actual <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> saw happen and was achievable. She was only a couple of years ahead of me and I could relate to her." ...|$|E
60|$|So I swore and {{repeated}} all this <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have written down.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] replied Peter, hopping to his feet. [...] "But you'll {{have to ask}} him. I've {{asked him}} for so many <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't dare ask for another right away, for fear that he will say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a nuisance." ...|$|R
5000|$|History {{and reading}} {{have always been}} two of Sam’s {{favorite}} interests, and he considers himself more of a storyteller than a writer. “I write <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would enjoy reading, and it’s a true blessing that others have found these tales interesting, informative, and entertaining.” ...|$|R
5000|$|About this story, Knight wrote [...] "The Enemy" [...] {{is one of}} two <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wrote when I {{was having}} some eye trouble and thought I might go blind...Just think, if I had been born blind, I might have written a lot more like this.|$|R

6000|$|... "What story?" [...] echoed Crispin. [...] "The <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> heard. Do you say I lie?" [...] And, swaying in his chair, {{he sought}} to assume an air of defiance.|$|E

60|$|I would, gentle Reader, {{you could}} hear the <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> meant to tell you. You judge me, of course, by the <b>stories</b> of mine <b>that</b> you have read--by this sort of thing, perhaps; but that is not just to me. The stories I have not told you, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am going to tell you one day, <b>I</b> would <b>that</b> you judge me by those.|$|R
5000|$|About Arias' {{most recent}} work of fiction, The Wetback and Other Stories (2016), author Paul Theroux writes, [...] "I felt reading these {{wonderful}} <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was admitted to}} an adjacent neighborhood, a rich culture that is another world—call it Amexica—both mysterious and magical, that is persuasive through its tenderness. My hope is that Ron Arias continues to write short <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> tell us who we are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Alas!' said Darsie, 'I know {{so little}} of our family <b>story,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> almost doubted that I belonged to the House of Redgauntlet, {{although}} {{the chief of the}} family himself intimated so much to me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{will tell}} you a <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have read of Martha and Mary; {{the name of the}} book I have forgot; I mean of the book in which I found the relation; but the thing was thus:-- ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{have just}} {{returned}} from a journey inland to the village of Insongo Mboyo. The abject misery and utter abandon is positively indescribable. I was so moved, Your Excellency, by the people's <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> took the liberty of promising them that in future you will only kill them for crimes they commit." ...|$|R
500|$|Kubrick stated {{himself that}} [...] "there is no {{deliberate}} pattern to the <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have chosen to}} make into films. About the only factor at work each time is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> try not to repeat myself". As a result, Kubrick was often misunderstood by critics, and only once did he have unanimously positive reviews upon {{the release of a}} film—for Paths of Glory.|$|R
5000|$|An {{imaginary}} {{alter ego}} of Avril Lavigne {{appears in the}} story {{as one of the}} main characters. Hana dreams of meeting Avril and being close friends.

6000|$|... "Why, master, as it {{happened}} you were {{in such a hurry}} to get on with your <b>story</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think you forgot to mention that she was present at the burying of the barrels. Her name was coming when I dropped the sword upon your foot." ...|$|E

60|$|Philip Eckert {{lived for}} many years in an old, weather-stained wooden house about three miles from the little town of Marion, in Vermont.
