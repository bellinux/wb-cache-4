5|$|Communications {{with the}} outside world went through a single Forest <b>Service</b> <b>line</b> until April 1943, when it was {{replaced}} by five Army telephone lines. This was increased to eight in March 1945. There were also three teletypewriters with encoding machines. The first was installed in March 1943, and two more were added in May 1943. One was removed in November 1945. There were telephones in the offices, but none in private residences, as the Army regarded this as a security hazard. There were some public phones in the township for emergencies. Since {{there was no way to}} prevent the lines being tapped, classified information could not be discussed over the phone lines. Initially the phone lines were operable only during business hours until enough WACs arrived to man the switchboard around the clock.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian State Railways serves Lysaker Station {{both with}} Oslo Commuter Rail trains {{as well as}} {{regional}} trains. Up to five daily express trains along the Sørlandet Line and the stop at Lysaker. It also serves an hourly headway of the R10 regional trains from the Drammen Line and Dovre Line. There are five hourly trains heading to Asker via the Asker Line, including the L12, L13 and L14. Westwards L12 runs to Kongsberg while they eastwards serve the Gardermoen Line, Trunk Line and the Kongsvinger Line. L1, a full-stop service on the Trunk- and Drammen Line, runs every thirty minutes. A rush-hour <b>service</b> <b>line</b> L2x, serving the Østfold Line, also serves Lysaker.|$|E

50|$|Some water <b>service</b> <b>lines</b> in Flint were {{installed}} between 1901 and 1920. As {{with many other}} municipalities at the time, all of the <b>service</b> <b>lines</b> from the cast iron water mains to end users' homes were constructed of lead, because it was relatively inexpensive and easy to work. Lead pipes can leach lead into the water, especially if certain contaminants are present. However, {{the water from the}} Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, where Flint had obtained its water since 1967, had been treated well enough that the leaching from the lead pipes was at levels considered acceptable by state and federal environmental protection agencies. There are an estimated 43,000 <b>service</b> <b>lines</b> in the city; these include 3,500 lead lines, 9,000 known galvanized lines, and 9,000 unknown <b>service</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{lines that}} {{delineate}} {{the width of}} the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the <b>service</b> <b>line</b> (middle of the court). The short mark {{in the center of each}} baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark. The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines. These are the boundaries used when doubles is being played. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines and are used as boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, which is considered playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the center of a player's side of the court is called the <b>service</b> <b>line</b> because the serve must be delivered into the area between the <b>service</b> <b>line</b> and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve.|$|E

25|$|The network grew {{saturated}} {{during the}} 1950s. Outdated technology limited {{the number of}} trains, which led the RATP to stop extending lines and concentrate on modernisation. The MP51 prototype was built, testing both rubber-tyred metro and basic automatic driving on the voie navette. The first replacements of the older Sprague trains began with experimental articulated trains and then with mainstream rubber-tyred metro MP55 and MP59, some of the latter still in <b>service</b> (<b>line</b> 11). Thanks to newer trains and better signalling, trains ran more frequently.|$|E

25|$|The players spin {{a racket}} {{to decide who}} serves first. This player starts the first rally by electing to serve from either {{the left or right}} service box. For a legal serve, one of the server's feet must be in the service box, not {{touching}} any part of the service box lines, as the player strikes the ball. After being struck by the racket, the ball must strike the front wall above the <b>service</b> <b>line</b> and below the out line and land in the opposite back quarter court. The receiving player can choose to volley a serve after it has hit the front wall. If the server wins the point, the two players switch sides for the following point.|$|E

25|$|A {{legal service}} starts a rally, {{in which the}} players {{alternate}} hitting the ball across the net. A legal return consists of the player or team hitting the ball before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net, provided that it still falls in the server's court. A player or team cannot hit the ball twice in a row. The ball must travel past the net into the other players' court. A ball that hits the net during a rally is still considered a legal return {{as long as it}} crosses into {{the opposite side of the}} court. The first player or team to fail to make a legal return loses the point. The server then moves to the other side of the <b>service</b> <b>line</b> at the start of a new point.|$|E
25|$|The Bx6, a {{critical}} Bronx crosstown corridor, was split off into 2 different routes {{from the original}} Bx6 local on September 3, 2017. The Bx6 local continues to make all local stops along the route. The Bx6 SBS will operate a similar route as the local, but the eastbound service will match the westbound service instead of exiting the Macombs Dam Bridge to Jerome Avenue. The Bx6 SBS supplements the existing Bx6 local service, making stops at select high-ridership locations and all transfers points to Metro-North and subways. The Bx6 SBS is based out of the West Farms Bus Depot, as is the Bx6 local. It is also the third Bronx Bus line to have Select Bus Service {{and the first one}} since the Bx41 on June 30, 2013. The Bx6 is also the MTA's 15th Select Bus <b>Service</b> <b>line</b> to date.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} walls to a squash court. The front wall, on which three {{parallel}} lines are marked, {{has the largest}} playing surface, whilst the back wall, which typically contains {{the entrance to the}} court, has the smallest. The out line runs {{along the top of the}} front wall, descending along the side walls to the back wall. There are no other markings on the side or back walls. Shots struck above or touching the out line, on any wall, are out. The bottom line of the front wall marks the top of the 'tin', a half metre-high metal area which if struck means that the ball is out. In this way the tin can be seen as analogous to the net in other racket sports such as tennis. The middle line of the front wall is the <b>service</b> <b>line</b> and is only relevant during serves.|$|E

25|$|All five {{lines of}} the Oslo Metro, {{numbered}} 1 through 5, run through the Common Tunnel. Most services have a 15-minute headway, which is increased to 30 minutes in the late evening and early on Sundays. Two lines have more frequent <b>service.</b> <b>Line</b> 2, which runs on the Furuset Line, has its headway reduced to 7.5 minutes and runs the entire tunnel. Line 3 on the Østensjø Line also has extra trains that terminate at Stortinget giving a 7.5 minute frequency {{on the east side}} of the tunnel. Line 5 trains run once around the Ring Line before continuing to their final destinations and therefore make two passes through the tunnel on a complete journey. Travel time from Majorstuen to Tøyen takes eight minutes. The tunnel is the bottleneck of the metro, with a capacity for 24 trains per hour in each direction west of Stortinget, and 28 east of Stortinget.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1990s, {{there was}} {{increasing}} tension between Andersen Consulting and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a {{provision of the}} 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – pay the other the 15 percent), {{while at the same}} time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting <b>service</b> <b>line</b> called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting claimed breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.|$|E

500|$|Between 1858 and 1873 {{several people}} in Victorian England experimented with a lawn version of tennis. Major Harry Gem and Augurio Perera {{demonstrated}} their game of Pelota (Spanish for ball) and in 1872 created the world's first lawn tennis club at Leamington Spa. In February 1874 Major Clopton Wingfield introduced {{his version of}} lawn tennis, called Sphairistikè; on his patent application, he {{described it as a}} [...] "New and Improved Court for Playing the Ancient Game of Tennis", and its rules were published in an eight-page booklet. Wingfield is widely credited with popularising the new game through his energetic promotional efforts. The Sphairistikè court was hourglass-shaped, wider at the baseline than at the net. The service was made from a single side in a lozenge shaped box situated {{in the middle of the}} court and it had to bounce beyond the <b>service</b> <b>line.</b> In November 1874 Wingfield published a second, expanded edition of The Book of the Game, which had 12 rules and featured a larger court and a slightly lower net.|$|E
