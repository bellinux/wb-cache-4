50|$|A Snap-fit (Integral Attachment Feature) is an {{assembly}} method used to attach flexible parts, usually plastic, {{to form the}} final product by pushing the parts' interlocking components together. There {{are a number of}} variations in snap fits, including cantilever, torsional and annular. Snap fits are an alternative to assembly using nails or screws, and have the advantages of speed and no loose parts. <b>Snap</b> <b>fit</b> connectors can be found in everyday products such as battery compartment lids, Snap fasteners and Pens.|$|E
50|$|In a {{torsional}} <b>snap</b> <b>fit,</b> {{one must}} deflect, or force the protruding edges of piece B {{away from the}} insertion area. Piece A then slides in between the protruding edges until the desired distance is reached. The edges of piece B is then released and piece A is held in place. The snap-fits in this description are the protruding edges of piece B. These types of snap-fits may have a spring in place; so that when activated, the locked in piece is released and put into action.|$|E
40|$|In robotic {{manipulation}} {{the interaction between}} robot and environment {{is an essential part}} of the task. In order to deal with impacts, friction and constrained motion, the proposed methods are not based on elaborate control schemes. Rather, a model-based optimization approach is suggested, which relies on a detailled dynamic model of the manipulator itself, the process dynamics of the task and the interactions between those two. These models are used to define an optimization problem, which is then solved using numerical programming methods. It is illustrated with an assembly task, namely mating a pair of <b>snap</b> <b>fits.</b> Utilizing a pre-optimized dynamic response behavior of the robot as developed in former work, [6], we plan trajectory and design parameters of the parts to be assembled, which influence the process dynamics and thus the external excitation of the manipulator dynamics. The expected advantage in industrial applications is a relatively easy implementation, because [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{compliant}} mechanism kit as a {{parallel to the}} kits available for rigid-body mechanisms. The kit consists of flexible beams and connectors {{that can be easily}} hand-assembled using <b>snap</b> <b>fits.</b> The mechanisms assembled using the kit accurately capture the aspects of the topology, shape, and size of joint-free compliant mechanisms. Thus, the kit enables designers to conceive and design new, practicable, single-piece compliant mechanisms that do not require assembly. The concept of the kit also resolves a discrepancy in the finite element (FE) modeling of beam-based compliant mechanisms. The discrepancy arises when two or more beams are joined at one point and thus leading to increased stiffness. After resolving this discrepancy, this work extends the topology optimization to automatically generate designs that can be assembled with the kit for quick and easy validation instead of time-consuming prototyping. Thus, the kit and the accompanying analysis and optimal synthesis procedures comprise a self-contained educational as well as a research and practice toolset for compliant mechanisms. The paper also illustrates how human creativity finds new ways of using the kit beyond the original intended use and how it enables even a novice to design compliant mechanisms.

50|$|Professor Per-Ingvar Brånemark {{discovered}} osseointegration in the 1950s {{which allows}} titanium implants to fuse with human bone. The discovery led to wide use in dental implants. In the mid-1970s Brånemark, {{together with his}} ENT colleague Dr Anders Tjellström, glued an Oticon bone vibrator to a <b>snap</b> coupling <b>fitted</b> to a dental implant and then connected it to an audiometer. The patient reported a very high, clear sound. It was obvious that the sound propagated very well through {{the bones of the}} maxilla to the inner ear. This became the starting point for the future development of the hearing device Baha together with the titanium implant.|$|R
50|$|The RepRap Snappy is {{designed}} to address to core goal of the RepRap project of creating a general-purpose self-replicating manufacturing machine. The RepRap Snappy is able to create 73% of its own parts by volume with a design that eliminates {{as many of the}} non 3D printed parts as possible including belts and bearings which are replaced with a rack and pinion system. The name Snappy comes from the use of <b>snap</b> <b>fit</b> connectors used on the small printed parts to construct larger pieces, this both cuts down on the use of non 3D printed parts and means a smaller build volume is needed on the machine producing the parts. The only non self replicating parts on the printer are the motors, electronics, a glass build plate and one 686 bearing, the 3D printed parts take around 150 hours to create. The RepRap Snappy received an honourable mention in the Uplift Prize Grand Personal Manufacturing Prize.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} concept, prototypes, and an optimal design method for a {{compliant}} mechanism kit as a {{parallel to the}} kits available for rigid-body mechanisms. The kit consists of flexible beams and connectors {{that can be easily}} hand-assembled using <b>snap</b> <b>fits.</b> It enables users, using their creativity and mechanics intuition, to quickly realize a compliant mechanism. The mechanisms assembled in this manner accurately capture the essential behavior of the topology, shape, size and material aspects and thereby can lead the way for a real compliant mechanism for practical use. Also described in this paper are the design of the connector to which flexible beams can be added in eight different directions; and prototyping of the spring steel connectors as well as beams using wire-cut electro discharge machining. It is noted in this paper that the concept of the kit also resolves a discrepancy in the finite element (FE) modeling of beam-based compliant mechanisms. The discrepancy arises when two or more beams are joining at one point and thus leading to increased stiffness. After resolving this discrepancy, this work extends the topology optimization to automatically generate designs that can be assembled with the kit.

The design process begins {{with the purpose of}} the chargers and a comparison to previous designs. Manufacturing processes and material selections are covered. Two plastic springs are designed and analyzed using classical equations and finite element analysis. Consideration is given to temperature and time effects on these springs. The major plastic structure (the housing) is analyzed for stress and deflection using finite element analysis with consideration given to thermal and creep effects. Datum selection is discussed. Tolerance analysis is performed on critical component interfaces. The previous charger design and the improved design are then analyzed and compared using the Boothroyd and Dewhurst Design for Assembly software. <b>Snap</b> <b>fit</b> insertion forces are determined using classical equations. Customer interfaces are reviewed and insertion forces quantified. A general approach to assembly system justification is provided. Manual assembly, flexible automation and hard automation are considered. Complete production drawings of all charger components are provided...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{frictional}} contact model is adopted {{for the analysis}} of conventional solid rivet setting. Material properties for the selected plates and rivets are obtained from analytical method using elastic constants and tensile strengths for each material. Rigid- and elasto-plastic models are selected for process analysis in this paper. Process variables are selected to investigate the effect of variables on the successful rivet setting and servicing in any structure as force transmitting member. Major variables in riveting process are material variables such as material properties and geometrical variables, which are dimensions of head, shank, and blank diameters. Analysis in this study is concentrated on the influence of variety of materials and of shank dimensions on the contact area after rivet setting, i. e. after forming process of rivet head. Soft and hard materials are selected as mother materials to investigate how the selection of material influences on the riveting process in quantitative manner. The geometry of head is closely investigated through simulation in terms of contact status, i. e. contact area between rivet head and mother material, which would affect the <b>snap</b> <b>fit</b> joint by riveting...|$|E
40|$|This CVF funded {{product design}} and {{development}} project for orthotic range aspires {{to be as}} effective as a functional foot orthotic. It is adaptable and customisable {{to meet the needs of}} the busy clinical environment as an off the shelf solution. Healthy Step has a successful foot orthotics and rehabilitation range. There is a growing area of business in the private market and internet sales. There is a perceived opportunity to develop a new brand of devices based upon the existing range that: •	Exude quality and performance – and would therefore carry a higher price point •	Are only available to clinics and clinicians – allowing clinics to set their own prices and be unaffected by Healthy Step’s direct to patient internet sales. •	Are not available direct to the patients. •	Focus on the business aspirations of the clinician and/or their practice. •	Allowing them to realise greater profit by “selling”/prescribing quality, branded, performance devices that deliver adaptable clinical treatments with a quality retail feel and offering. Heel, ball and arch orthotic components of the existing vectorthotic were improved during the this project. Completion was a great live experience for the team although some issue with the printing tolerances as it had an impact on the first phase of iterations especially the <b>snap</b> <b>fit</b> parts of the orthotic but with product testing and feedback from the client these were overcome. The project resulted the company investing in a mid range 3 D printing device and relevant software & hardware,an a placement student.

Silman underwent examination by a court-appointed sanity commission which declared him competent for trial. The trial judge found Silman not guilty for the killing of his father, {{who had tried to}} disarm his son, but concluded that the defendant was guilty as charged with the first-degree murder of his sister, brother-in-law, and uncle. He was sentenced to three concurrent life sentences at hard labor, without the possibility of probation, parole, or suspended sentence. The sentence was thrown out by the Louisiana Court of Appeal for the Third Circuit in Lake Charles but reinstated in 1995 by the Louisiana Supreme Court.|$|R
