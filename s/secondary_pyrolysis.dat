40|$|Pyrolysis {{of scrap}} tyres has been {{investigated}} by means of non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis, at heating rates ranging from 5 to 900 degrees C/min and particle sizes of 1 and 3 mm. The occurrence of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> stages has been recognized at low heating rates. Based on experimental findings and on the relevant literature on pyrolysis of rubber components, a series-parallel reaction network and a kinetic model are proposed. Accordingly, {{the first stage of}} weight loss is related to depolymerization of the rubber components. The residue, upon cyclization and crosslinking, degrades in the secondary stage at larger temperatures. Kinetic parameters of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> and of the cyclization/crosslinking stages are determined on the basis of experimental results obtained under chemical kinetic controlled pyrolysis conditions. At large heating rates distinction between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> is no longer observed and a single peak of the pyrolysis rate is observed. This phenomenology can be partly related to decreasing extent of cyclization/crosslinking that take place as the heating rate is raised. Moreover, radial non-uniformities of either temperature, overall volatile pressure or concentration can be established at larger heating rates. These can be further responsible for the modification of the pyrolysis pattern. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

The results showed that the chemical changes in the wood material in the eight samples examined had different entities and extents with comparison to sound oak wood. Samples taken from the external parts of the fragments had undergone a significant loss in polysaccharide components, whereas the internal parts were in a relatively good state of preservation. Evaluation of the relative amounts of pyrolysis products deriving from holocellulose and lignin highlighted that specific categories of compounds, such as lignin monomers and anhydrosugars, can be taken as an index for good preservation of wood components.

In addition, the pressure drop results suggest that the increased quantity of plates caused short circuiting of gas and raised the particle interstices, which reduced the gas diffusion resistance of pyrolysis products. Therefore, more gaseous pyrolysis products flowed into central low-temperature coal bed and escaped from the gas collection pipe, suppressing the <b>secondary</b> reaction of <b>pyrolysis</b> products and increasing the tar yield and quality.

Taking into account of the importance of downdraft biomass gasifier and its commercial applications, it is essential to have a complete model for such a configuration. In the present study, a transient onedimensional model is developed for the throated close-top downdraft biomass gasifier. The model takes into account of the drying, <b>pyrolysis,</b> <b>secondary</b> tar reactions, homogeneous gas reactions and heterogeneous combustion/gasification reactions. The experimental data obtained in our earlier study are used to validate the simulation results of the complete combined transport and kinetic model. The fraction of initial moisture content, air flow rate, temperature of the drying & pyrolysis zone, and chemical composition of the biomass are required as input data for the model to predict the composition of producer gas. The variation of molar fraction of producer gas components with time is predicted and compared with the experimental data. It is concluded from the present study that the developed model can predict the performance of the biomass gasifier, a priori. The results of this study are also useful in the design of a downdraft biomass gasifier. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{secondary}} reactions occurring {{during the}} formation of shale oil are investigated with Huadian oil shale pyrolysis by solid heat carrier in a newly devised moving bed with internals (MBI). The effect of secondary reactions, which are mainly vapor-phase cracking, on shale oil property and yield at different temperatures is characterized {{on the basis of}} ultimate, C- 13 NMR and GC-MS analyses of the produced oil. The increases in the production rate of hydrocarbon gas species and related molar ratios clarify that the oil vapor cracking, rather than coking, is the main <b>secondary</b> reactions at <b>pyrolysis</b> temperature over 495 degrees C. Ultimate analysis of shale oil shows that cracking increases the carbon and nitrogen contents of oil but decreases its hydrogen and oxygen contents. There are obvious decreases in the atomic H/C and O/C ratios of shale oil with increasing the pyrolysis temperature. NMR analysis shows that the aromaticity of shale oil increases considerably due to secondary reactions. Selective concentration of existing aromatics and aromatization of aliphatics are of roughly equal importance. The GC-MS results indicate that the aliphatic hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes) are the main detected components in shale oil and represent 75 % of the detected peak areas. Via oil vapor cracking, a part of long-chain aliphatics is transformed into short-chain alkanes, alkenes and gas species to increase the low-carbon hydrocarbons. The increase in aromatic proportion with raising temperature is due to the selective concentration by cracking aliphatics and aromatization reactions such as dehydrogenation and their subsequent reactions.

40|$|A {{metallic}} plate {{has been}} devised {{to enhance the}} heat transfer; this in turn increases the yield and quality of coal tar (Zhang et al., 2013). This work is devoted to investigating the pyrolysis of Yilan subbituminous coal and developing a working mechanism for an indirectly heated fixed bed reactor with different number of metallic plates. Increasing the number of metallic heating plates enhanced the heat transfer from the high-temperature reactor wall to the low-temperature central coal layer and thereby shortened the reaction time. Meanwhile, the yields of tar and light fraction were increased then decreased. The results of the pressure drop experiment demonstrated that the metallic plates weakened dense stacks of coal particles and raised the particle interstices, and therefore lowered the gas diffusion resistance. It verified that many gaseous pyrolysis products escaped from the central low-temperature coal layer, indicating the suppressed secondary reactions to the primary products. When the number of plates was 8, the correspondingly added high-temperature surface was 113 %; it achieved the optimal matching between the <b>secondary</b> reactions of <b>pyrolysis</b> products and the fields of the temperature {{as well as the}} gas flow inside the reactor, and it also had the highest tar yield (6. 60 wt. % dry basis) and the maximum content of light tar (below the boiling points of 360 degrees C) of 76. 4 wt. % and C 4 -C 9 components of 43. 52 wt. %. The BET results showed that the char had the biggest surface area and volume for this case with 8 plates. Consequently, adding suitable metallic plates into the indirectly heated fixed bed reactor obviously enhances the heat transfer and also achieves higher yield and quality of tar.
