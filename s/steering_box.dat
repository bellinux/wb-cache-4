25|$|In February 1972, Leyland {{announced}} the AN68 series {{to replace the}} PDR1/PDR2. The new chassis provided a wider entrance and several new safety features were included. An audible and visible alarm discouraged engine overheating by giving the driver due warning. A fail-safe parking brake was introduced, while the <b>steering</b> <b>box</b> and brake controls were protected against damage from severe head-on collision and stainless steel air-piping gave greater resistance to corrosion.|$|E
25|$|Another GS option {{package was}} {{available}} on the Buick Wildcat and Wildcat Custom, hardtop and convertible. The GS package included a 3.42 ratio posi rear, variable rate suspension springs, quick ratio <b>steering</b> <b>box,</b> heavy duty sway bars, and a switch-pitch turbo-hydramatic 400 transmission. The addition of the Y48 option gave the purchaser a pair of Carter AFB four barrel carburators, and finned aluminum valve covers on the 425 nail head engine. This was a one-year only option, existing in 1966 only. The Y48 option was delivered in the trunk and installed by the dealer.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, the R/T trim {{returned}} after a one-year hiatus. The R/T {{consisted of a}} new [...] SOHC Magnum 2.0L Engine, [...] wheels, spoiler, dual chrome exhaust tips, quicker <b>steering</b> <b>box</b> and stiffer springs. The 2001 and 2002 R/Ts had a flat, 'hammerhead' spoiler. From 2000-2003, the R/T was sold as a Chrysler in the United Kingdom. The Neon was offered with a sport package for the 2001 model year only commemorating Dodge's return to the NASCAR scene. It consisted of an R/T wing, R/T [...] wheels, R/T springs, Goodyear NASCAR raised yellow-lettering tires, 'Dodge Motorsports' side decals, white instrument cluster and R/T <b>steering</b> <b>box.</b> It was an R/T visually except {{for the lack of}} dual exhaust, R/T lower mouldings, fog lamps and R/T exclusive front bumper. The Sport only came equipped with the base model's [...] engine and was available with an automatic transmission (unlike the manual-only R/T model). 2001 was the last year for the Plymouth Neon, and the Plymouth brand as well. The last Plymouth Neon, which was also the last Plymouth ever produced (a silver four-door sedan), rolled off the assembly line on June 28, 2001.|$|E
2500|$|The GT {{package was}} {{available}} on the Spirit liftback and included among other features, blacked out exterior trim, radial tires with styled wheels, black leather-wrapped sport steering wheel and console, tachometer and [...] "Rallye" [...] gauges, {{as well as a}} special [...] "deep-tone" [...] exhaust system. The package also had a rear spoiler, and other sporty features that offered AMC to have a competitor in design, style, price, size, and performance to the new-for-1979 Fox-based Ford Mustang. A separate GT [...] "rally-tuned" [...] suspension option included tuned front and rear sway bars, [...] "Hi-Control" [...] rear leaf springs with [...] "iso-clamp" [...] pads, special strut rod bushings, adjustable Gabriel [...] "Strider" [...] shock absorbers, as well as heavy-duty brakes and a quick ratio <b>steering</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E

The Corsa came standard with an instrument panel featuring a [...] speedometer with resettable trip odometer, a 6,000rpm tachometer, cylinder head temperature gauge, analog clock with a sweeping second hand, a manifold vacuum/pressure gauge and fuel gauge. A much better heater system, larger brakes borrowed from the Chevelle, a stronger differential ring gear, a Delcotron alternator (replacing the generator), and significant chassis refinements were made. Out back, a new fully articulated rear suspension virtually eliminated {{the danger of the}} previous generation's swing axles, and was based on the contemporary Corvette Sting Ray (Corvair used coil springs while the Sting Ray uses a transverse leaf). [...] AM/FM stereo radio, in-dash All Weather Air Conditioning, telescopically adjustable steering column, and a Special Purpose Chassis Equipment ("Z17") handling package, consisting of a special performance suspension and quick ratio <b>steering</b> <b>box,</b> were significant new options for 1965. [...] The Monza and Corvair 500 Sport Sedans were the only compact cars ever available in the U.S. as pillarless four door hardtops.|$|E
25|$|During {{much of the}} 20th century, Saginaw's {{economy was}} {{dominated}} by manufacturing related to the automotive industry; most notably, manual transmission assemblies, <b>steering</b> gear <b>boxes</b> and power <b>steering</b> pumps. At the height of manufacturing in the 1960s and 1970s, the city and neighboring Buena Vista Township hosted 12 General Motors plants, an Eaton Manufacturing plant where 5,000 people turned out auto parts (demolished 2008), and numerous smaller concerns.|$|R
5000|$|A better {{engineer}} than businessman, Miller {{declared bankruptcy}} in 1933 {{and was looking}} for new opportunities. Tucker persuaded Miller {{to join him in}} building race cars, and they formed [...] "Miller and Tucker, Inc." [...] in 1935. The company's first job was building 10 souped-up Ford V-8 racers for Henry Ford. The time to develop and test the cars was insufficient, however, and the <b>steering</b> <b>boxes</b> on all entrants overheated and locked up, causing them {{to drop out of the}} race. The design was later perfected by privateers, with examples running at Indy through 1948. Miller and Tucker, Inc. continued race car development and various other ventures until Miller's death in 1943. Tucker and Miller were close friends, and he even helped his widow pay for Miller's funeral costs. While working with Miller, Tucker met the Chevrolet brothers and chief mechanic/engineer John Eddie Offutt, who would later help Tucker develop and build the first prototype of the Tucker '48. Tucker's outgoing personality and his involvement at Indianapolis made him well known in the automotive industry by 1939.|$|R

2500|$|The {{biggest change}} for the Torino was the switch to body-on-frame {{construction}} from the unit-construction of the 1971 models. The new chassis was a perimeter design {{that was used to}} help give the Torino a quieter and more isolated ride. It featured an energy absorbing [...] "S" [...] shaped front end, torque boxes to isolate road shock, fourteen rubber body mounts and five solid cross members. The front suspension used an unequal length control arm design, with a computer selected coil spring mounted on the strut stabilized lower control arm, much like the fullsize Ford LTD. The rear used the [...] "Stabul" [...] four link suspension with a computer selected coil spring mounted on a solid axle. The new suspension and chassis had a wheel track at least [...] wider than the 1971 models. [...] Motor Trend stated the [...] "road isolation and vibrational dampening is superb" [...] in its test of a 1972 Gran Torino Brougham 4-door. Ford offered two suspension options, the heavy-duty and competition suspension. The heavy-duty suspension included a larger front sway bar, and heavy-duty springs and shocks. [...] Competition suspension, only available in two-door models, included the most heavy-duty springs and shocks, heavy duty rear upper control arms and bushings, a larger front sway bar, and the addition of a rear sway bar. This was the first year that a rear sway bar was offered in the Torino and was only available with competition and police suspension options. Front disc brakes became standard on all Torinos, which no other American intermediate (other than its sister car the Mercury Montego) offered in 1972, however, power brakes remained an option. [...] The only exceptions were that power brakes were standard on the Gran Torino Squire station wagons and a mandatory option for all [...] powered models. The power steering was revised to be integral in the <b>steering</b> <b>box,</b> rather than the external booster style used in previous years. All Torinos used 14-inch wheels, while 15-inch wheels were used for exclusively by police and taxi models.|$|E

5000|$|Manganese Bronze, the now troubled {{maker of}} London taxis {{was thrown into}} further turmoil after it {{announced}} plans to recall 400 black cabs and suspend sales, following discovery of a steering fault. Manganese reported {{the discovery of a}} defect with new <b>steering</b> <b>boxes</b> in its TX4 models, which had been introduced in February 2012 to vehicles produced at its Coventry factory. It warned that the recall and sales suspension would have a [...] "material and detrimental" [...] impact on its cashflow and said it was looking at options for the firm. The news came as the latest blow to the company, which had been hit by mounting losses and an accounting blunder that left it with a £4 million hole in its accounts. Manganese, which suspended trading of its shares earlier in the day, said it was working with Chinese partner Geely (already a 20% shareholder in the business) to fix the steering fault. But they said: [...] "Until such time that a technical solution is developed to rectify the fault, the financial position of the group remains unclear and trading in the company's shares will remain suspended."

5000|$|The Echidnas {{were three}} Devin-bodied {{specials}} built by Ed Grierson, Bill Larson, and John Staver. The Echidnas were built on shortened, narrowed 1956 Chevrolet passenger-car frames with custom cross-bracing. Front suspension was independent using many stock Chevrolet sedan and Corvette parts including coil-springs, links, a-arms and, at least initially, <b>steering</b> <b>boxes.</b> Morris Minor rack-and-pinion steering was adapted later. Brakes were Corvette drums all {{around and the}} wheels were standard Corvette items. The rear suspension was a narrowed Chevrolet live axle with Positraction that was located originally on factory leaf springs, but in later revisions by trailing arms (one or two per side depending on version) and a Watt's linkage. The early engines were Chevrolet small-block V8s displacing [...] with Rochester fuel injection. A later change put a [...] engine in one car. The transmission was a BorgWarner T-10 4-speed manual. An article in the May 1960 edition of Sports Cars Illustrated magazine said that to {{the date of the}} article the Echidnas had managed eight overall firsts and 17 firsts in their class, finishing first, second or third a total of 19 times overall. The same article reported that the Echidna's designers were considering building a fourth chassis as a test-bed for investigating independent rear suspensions.|$|R

5000|$|Cugini Randi {{was a small}} Italian company {{active in}} the {{agricultural}} machinery production sector, formed {{at the end of}} the Second World War, presumably in 1947, whose headquarters was located in Bagnacavallo in the province of Ravenna (Italy). The factory was founded by brothers Umberto and Dardano Randi, along with his cousin Ettore Randi. They started the business repairing machines, then building, with recycled materials, circular saws sold to some local carpenters and used by them until the end of the 90s (nearly 40 years of service). Subsequently, the factory began to transform American and English military tracked motor vehicles, left by the Allies after the end of the war, in tracked agriculture tractors. They adapted petrol 8 cylinder engines in order to operate with agricultural oil. Umberto, an expert engineer trained in Autocentro Militare in Bologna, invented, for this purpose, an oil agriculture vaporizer, using war materials remnants (shells of large caliber bullets and a series of copper tubes). In light of the success of the early fifties, the company began to produce real wheeled tractors of medium size (models R14 - R50), and made almost all the pieces needed for their construction. At the same time, Cugini Randi began to produce their first motocultivator as well as some machines such as the [...] "Grillo" [...] and the tiller R5. At the end of the 50s, Umberto died. Dardano and Ettore continued to work in the agriculture sector, diversifying the production. They started building <b>steering</b> <b>boxes</b> for different types of vehicles (construction machinery, etc.), they abandoned the production of medium-sized tractors and focused the production in tiller, motocultivators and small 4-wheel drive tractors.|$|R

40|$|Scientists {{have long}} been able to shift the {{direction}} of a laser beam, steering it toward a target, but often the strength and focus of the light is altered. For precision applications, where the quality of the beam cannot be compromised, scientists have typically turned to mechanical steering methods, redirecting the source of the beam by swinging the entire laser apparatus toward the target. Just as the mechanical methods used for turning cars has evolved into simpler, lighter, power steering methods, so has the means by which researchers can direct lasers. Some of the typical contraptions used to redirect lasers are large and bulky, relying on steering gimbals pivoted, rotating supports to shift the device toward its intended target. These devices, some as large and awkward as a piece of heavy luggage, are subject to the same issues confronted by mechanical parts: Components rub, wear out, and get stuck. The poor reliability and bulk not to mention the power requirements to run one of the machines have made mechanical beam steering components less than ideal for use in applications where weight, bulk, and maneuverability are prime concerns, such as on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or a microscope. The solution to developing reliable, lighter weight, nonmechanical steering methods to replace the hefty <b>steering</b> <b>boxes</b> was to think outside the box, and a NASA research partner did just that by developing a new beam steering method that bends and redirects the beam, as opposed to shifting the entire apparatus. The benefits include lower power requirements, a smaller footprint, reduced weight, and better control and flexibility in steering capabilities. Such benefits are realized without sacrificing aperture size, efficiency, or scanning range, and can be applied to myriad uses: propulsion systems, structures, radiation protection systems, and landing systems...|$|R
5000|$|The {{rear-wheel drive}} K {{platform}} was based closely {{on the very}} similar 4th generation GM X platform, and 2nd generation F-bodies of the 1970s, all of which shared many components (control arms, springs, steering linkage and associated steering gear) in common. The K platform stretched the X platform to 114.3 inch wheelbase, but also improved isolation from sources of structure borne vibration in the drivetrain and suspension. While automobiles built on these three platforms had different bodies, they shared the same unibody construction technology using a separable elastomer isolated front subframe assembly, a design which first appeared in GM vehicles on the 1st generation X platform in 1962 on the Chevy II. Automobiles built on these three platforms (F, K, and X) also shared front and rear suspension systems, with tunings engineered to each application. The front suspensions used unequal length A-arms, coil springs damped with tubular hydraulic shock absorbers, ball joints, elastomer bushings, and recirculating ball <b>steering</b> <b>boxes</b> differing in ratios that were specific to the application. The rear suspension design used a live axle (solid axle - which was a GM corporate 10 bolt differential with an 8.5" [...] ring gear) located by leaf springs (shared with the 1968-74 and 1975-79 X platform) damped with tubular hydraulic shock absorbers. Rear disc brakes were standard equipment in 1977 - this design later ended up with some 1979-81 Pontiac Trans Ams with the WS6 option. At {{the same time the}} rear disc brakes were made standard equipment the front brakes received a modified steering knuckle which used a 12-inch disc brake rotor (shared with the GM B platform station wagons and C/D platform except limousines and commercial chassis) - the wheel bolt pattern was changed from the GM 5 x 4.75 (used with Chevrolets and lower end BOP automobiles) to the 5 on 5 bolt pattern used {{with the rest of the}} Cadillac RWD lineup (also with higher end BOP automobiles and Chevrolet/GMC 1/2 ton light duty trucks, vans, and SUVs).|$|R
