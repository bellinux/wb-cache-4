40|$|This {{study is}} the first to empirically assess the {{difference}} between the prevailing <b>salary</b> structures <b>in</b> economics and agricultural economics departments at public institutions in the United States. We find that average <b>salaries</b> <b>in</b> economics departments tend to be higher than <b>salaries</b> <b>in</b> agricultural economics departments. Regression analysis suggest that years since Ph. D. explains a greater proportion of <b>salaries</b> <b>in</b> agricultural economics departments while the tier of school explains a great proportion of <b>salaries</b> structure <b>in</b> economics departments. Regression results also suggest that the returns to publications in top 36 and other economics journals is higher in economics departments while publications in core and regional agricultural economics journals is more highly rewarded in agricultural economics departments.

5|$|The {{conflict}} between Pistrucci and William Wyon {{continued into the}} late 1840s, and sometimes featured in the press, contributing to the feeling that all was not well at the Mint. A Royal Commission on reform of the Royal Mint was appointed in 1848. Pistrucci submitted a report, in which he settled some old scores. The reforms abolished the positions of chief engraver (Wyon died in 1851) and chief medallist, with Pistrucci appointed a modeller and engraver to the Mint, to receive a <b>salary</b> <b>in</b> addition to payment for any work done.|$|E
5|$|By 1730, on the {{recommendation}} of General Wilhelm Dietrich von Buddenbrock, the rehabilitated Zieten entered the newly-formed Freikompanie (independent company) of hussars at Potsdam. On 1 March 1732, a second company of the Hussars was created, and Zieten was appointed as its chief and promoted to the Rittmeister with 50 thalers a month's <b>salary.</b> <b>In</b> summer 1732, Zieten was given four weeks of arrest for an offense. In 1735, Frederick William appointed Zieten as the head of a hussar company, and sent him to the Imperial Army on the Rhine, where he participated in the Rhine campaign. Károly József Batthyány, the Austrian hussars' superintendent, served as his mentor in the fighting against France. At that time, the Austrians were the reputed masters of light cavalry work. His next promotion, to major took place on 29 January 1736.|$|E

40|$|The author uses {{a spatial}} econometric {{framework}} {{to examine the}} determinants of teacher <b>salaries</b> <b>in</b> the United States, including union activity in the teachers’ own and in neighboring districts, teacher <b>salaries</b> <b>in</b> nearby districts, and other school district characteristics such as size and student-teacher ratios. Using the 1999 – 2000 Schools and Staffing Survey {{as well as the}} School District Demographic System and Bureau of Labor Statistics data sets, he finds that union activity increases salaries for experienced teachers by as much as 18 to 28 %; it increases salaries for beginning teachers, however, by considerably less. Results also confirm that salaries for experienced and beginning teachers are positively affected by the <b>salaries</b> of teachers <b>in</b> nearby districts. A one-percent increase in the distance-weighted average of teacher <b>salaries</b> <b>in</b> nearby districts increases <b>salaries</b> <b>in</b> a given district by 0. 52 % for experienced teachers and 0. 66 % for beginning teachers. Studies that ignore such spatial dependence are likely to be mis-specified and may lead to misleading conclusions...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} workload—Hay {{wrote that he}} was busy 20 hours a day—he tried to make as normal a life as possible, eating his meals with Nicolay at Willard's Hotel, going to the theatre with Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln, and reading Les Misérables in French. Hay, still in his early 20s, spent time both in barrooms and at cultured get-togethers {{in the homes of}} Washington's elite. The two {{secretaries}} often clashed with Mary Lincoln, who resorted to various stratagems to get the dilapidated White House restored without depleting Lincoln's salary, which had to cover entertainment and other expenses. Despite the secretaries' objections, Mrs. Lincoln was generally the victor and managed to spend almost 70% of her husband's <b>salary</b> <b>in</b> his four years in office.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, the Senators {{would sign}} Daigle to a $12.25 million contract, the largest rookie <b>salary</b> <b>in</b> League history, which {{would lead to}} a cap on rookie {{contracts}} a few years later. The club would promote Daigle over Alexei Yashin, nominating Daigle for rookie of the year over Yashin. His play did not justify full-time status and in 1995, coaches Rick Bowness and Alain Vigneault demoted Daigle to part-time status. The move led to Bowness and Vigneault being fired. In the end, Daigle did not come close to the career the Senators hoped for. After scoring only 74 goals in just over four seasons, he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers, and is widely {{regarded as one of the}} biggest draft busts in sports history.|$|E

Braham decided he {{could not afford to}} pay for his three sons' private education on a wing commander's <b>salary</b> <b>in</b> Britain. He joined the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) with the rank of wing commander and on much better pay. On 6 June 1952 the Brahams sailed to Canada. Braham was immediately appointed staff officer for operations and training at Air Defence near Montreal. He taught aircrew how to fly, carry out interceptions and fight in all types of weather. He flew the fast Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck on 39 occasions and North American F-86 Sabre as well as the Lockheed T-33. Altogether he flew 193 times with the RCAF. His next appointment was 200 miles north of Toronto at the All-Weather Fighter Operational Training Unit.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Tarkovsky {{wanted his}} ex-wife, Irma Raush, as Hari. After meeting Swedish actress Bibi Andersson in June 1970, however, {{he decided that}} she was a better actress for the role. Wishing to work with Tarkovsky, Andersson {{accepted}} her <b>salary</b> <b>in</b> rubles. Nevertheless, Natalya Bondarchuk was ultimately cast as Hari. Tarkovsky had met her when they were students at the State Institute of Cinematography. It was she who had introduced the novel, Solaris to him. Tarkovsky auditioned her in 1970 but decided she was too young for the part. He instead recommended her to director Larisa Shepitko who cast her in You and I. Half-a-year later, Tarkovsky screened that film and was so pleasantly surprised by her performance that he decided to cast Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari after all.|$|E
5|$|The Bastille {{was being}} used to hold prisoners once again by the reign of Louis XI, who began to use it {{extensively}} as a state penitentiary. An early escapee from the Bastille during this period was Antoine de Chabannes, Count of Dammartin {{and a member of}} the League of the Public Weal, who was imprisoned by Louis and escaped by boat in 1465. The captains of the Bastille during this period were primarily officers and royal functionaries; Philippe de Melun was the first captain to receive a <b>salary</b> <b>in</b> 1462, being awarded 1,200 livres a year. Despite being a state prison, the Bastille retained the other traditional functions of a royal castle, and was used to accommodate visiting dignitaries, hosting some lavish entertainments given by Louis XI and Francis I.|$|E

5|$|Upon his {{retirement}} as a player, Selke offered Richard {{a job as}} a team ambassador and promised to pay him his full playing <b>salary</b> <b>in</b> the first year. After serving in the position for three years, Richard was named a vice-president of the Canadiens in 1964. He became disgruntled with a role he felt was powerless and only honorary, and resigned one year later. Richard grew estranged from the organization as his desire {{to be involved in the}} team's operations was ignored, and the split deepened when the Canadiens forced Frank Selke to retire in 1965. He eventually refused to allow his name to be associated with the team.|$|E
5|$|During his career, Russell {{was one of}} {{the first}} big earners in NBA basketball. His 1956 rookie {{contract}} was worth $24,000, only fractionally smaller than the $25,000 of top earner Bob Cousy. In contrast to other Celtics, who had to work in the offseason to maintain their standard of living (Heinsohn sold insurance, Gene Guarilia was a professional guitar player, Cousy ran a basketball camp, and Auerbach invested in plastics and a Chinese restaurant), Russell never had to work part-time. When Wilt Chamberlain became the first NBA player to earn $100,000 in <b>salary</b> <b>in</b> 1965, Russell went to Auerbach and demanded a $100,001 salary, which he promptly received. For his promotion to coach the Celtics paid Russell an annual salary of $25,000 which was in addition to his salary as a player; although the salary was touted in the press as a record for an NBA coach, it is unclear whether Russell's continued $100,001 salary as a player was included in the calculation.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2016–17 season, the Hawks {{extended}} Hardaway a qualifying offer, {{making him}} a restricted free agent (giving the Hawks the right to match any offer that he signed). On July 6, 2017, Hardaway received a four-year, $71 million offer sheet from the Knicks; Atlanta had 48 hours to match the offer or lose Hardaway. The contract of $16.50M, $17.32M, $18.15M and $18.97M has a player option in year 4 and includes a 15% bonus of outstanding year 1 through 3 <b>salary</b> <b>in</b> {{the event of a}} trade. The Hawks declined to match the offer, and Hardaway signed with the Knicks on July 8. Hardaway began the season in the starting lineup. On October 29, 2017, he scored a game-high 34 points in a 114–95 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. On November 8, 2017, with Kristaps Porzingis sidelined, Hardaway posted his first NBA career double-double with a game-high 26 points and 11 rebounds against the Orlando Magic.|$|E
