50|$|In most {{theoretical}} literature, {{price dispersion}} is argued as result from spatial difference {{and the existence}} of significant search cost. With the development of internet and <b>shopping</b> <b>agent</b> programs, conventional wisdom tells that price dispersion should be alleviated and may eventually disappear in the online market due to the reduced search cost for both price and product features. However, recent studies found a surprisingly high level of price dispersion online, even for standardized items such as books, CDs and DVDs. There is some evidence of a shrinking of this online price dispersion, but it remains significant. Recently, work has also been done in the area of e-commerce, specifically the Semantic Web, and its effects on price dispersion.|$|E

To facilitate the <b>shop</b> <b>agent’s</b> search for mutually beneficial alternative bundles, we develop a method for online learning customers’ preferences, while respecting their privacy. By introducing additional parameters, we represent customers’ highly nonlinear preferences as a linear model. We develop a method for learning the underlying stochastic process of these parameters online. As the conducted computer experiments show, the developed method {{has a number of}} advantages: it scales well, the acquired knowledge is robust towards changes in the shop’s pricing strategy, and it performs well even if customers behave strategically...|$|R
40|$|Shopping online {{is still}} a {{confusing}} activity due to many vendors, inconsistent information, and di#erent vendor site organization. <b>Shopping</b> <b>agents</b> based on user-centered business models have been unsuccessful in the past because shoppers have not perceived price comparison as a service worth paying for. As a result shopping bots today are biased in favor of vendors who pay fees to be listed. To make user-centered business models viable, <b>shopping</b> <b>agents</b> must become more useful. To this end we describe a shopping assistant capable of learning the heterogeneous and dynamic preferences of shoppers by observing their behavior unobtrusively, and of presenting shoppers with adaptively customized information about new items discovered by autonomously monitoring vendor sites...|$|R
40|$|Software agents help {{automate}} {{a variety}} of tasks including those involved in buying and selling products over the Internet. Although <b>shopping</b> <b>agents</b> provide convenience for consumers and yield more efficient markets, today's first-generation <b>shopping</b> <b>agents</b> are limited to comparing merchant offerings only on price instead of their full range of value. As such, they do a disservice to both consumers and retailers by hiding important merchant value-added services from consumer consideration. Likewise, the increasingly popular online auctions pit sellers against buyers in distributive negotiation tug-of-wars over price. This paper analyzes these approaches from economic, behavioral, and software agent perspectives then proposes integrative negotiation as a more suitable approach to retail electronic commerce. Finally, we identify promising techniques (e. g., multi-attribute utility theory, distributed constraint satisfaction, and conjoint analysis) for implementing agent-mediated integrative negotiation. 1...|$|R
50|$|The first widely {{recognized}} comparison-shopping agent was BargainFinder, developed by Andersen Consulting (now Accenture). The team, led by researcher Bruce Krulwich, created BargainFinder in 1995 {{as an experiment}} and published it on-line without advance warning to the e-commerce sites being compared. The first commercial <b>shopping</b> <b>agent,</b> called Jango, was produced by Netbot, a Seattle startup company founded by University of Washington professors Oren Etzioni and Daniel S. Weld; Netbot was acquired by the Excite portal in late 1997. Junglee, a Bay-area startup, also pioneered comparison shopping technology and was soon acquired by Amazon.com. Other early comparison shopping agents included pricewatch.com and killerapp.com. NexTag another entry into comparison shopping was named Times magazine world top 50 website in 2008.|$|E
50|$|A {{comparison}} shopping website, {{sometimes called}} a price comparison website, Price Analysis tool, comparison <b>shopping</b> <b>agent,</b> shopbot or comparison shopping engine, is a vertical search engine that shoppers use to filter and compare products based on price, features, reviews and other criteria. Most comparison shopping sites aggregate product listings {{from many different}} retailers but do not directly sell products themselves instead mostly they make use of affiliate marketing to earn. In the United Kingdom, these services made between £780m and £950m in revenue in 2005. Hence, E-commerce accounted for an 18.2 percent share of total business turnover in the United Kingdom in 2012. Online sales already account for 13% of the total UK economy, and its expected to increase to 15% by 2017. There is a huge contribution of comparison shopping websites in the expansion of current E-commerce industry.|$|E

40|$|Internet <b>Shopping</b> <b>Agents</b> (ISAs) allow {{consumers}} to costlessly search many online retailers and buy {{at the lowest}} price. One would expect these ISAs to subject sellers to intense price competition that results in uniform low prices. Yet, Internet retailers have joined these ISAs. Furthermore, the prices charged by inside retailers can vary substantially. We {{examine the impact of}} ISAs on market competition. An ISA creates differentiation in the pricing strategies of ex-ante identical retailers: Some retailers join the ISA due to mass of consumers that they can potentially win, while others stay out and extract surplus from their loyal consumers, while others stay our and extract surplus from their loyal consumers. The equilibrium inside pricing is such that the average price charged can increase or decrease when more retailers join, depending on whether or not the reach of the ISA is independent of the number of joining retailers. When the reach is endogenous, there exist a unique number of inside retailers. consumer search, comparison <b>shopping,</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>agents,</b> internet intermediaries, internet retailing, game theory, electronic commerce...|$|R
40|$|Comparison {{shopping}} is a merchant brokering process {{that provides the}} information about a specific product from several distributed shopping mall sites. The implementation of a comparison <b>shopping</b> <b>agent</b> is a challenging issue mainly because different on-line shopping malls employ their own way of organizing interface components, processing user queries, and displaying search results on the browser. In most of the previous comparsion shoppers, a human designer manually builds the wrapper for each shopping mall that contains rules for extracting product information. This approach is not scalable since the designer must build a wrapper by hand for each new shopping mall. Scalable comparison shoppers such as ShopBot have been suggested that automatically build the wrapper through learning, but since these systems assume some regularities and strong biases, many real-world shopping malls are unable to be recognized.

There are however a lot of legal issues related to the use of Shopping Agents such as how to legally classify Shopping Agents or if contracts concluded by Shopping Agents are binding upon its principal. Further it is questionable if the principal is liable for the conduct of the Agent. The evaluation of these legal issues will be completed by a description of the characteristics of such Agents. 1 What are Shopping Agents? At present online shopping is still an arduous venture. In order to acquire a product suppliers have to be found and a comparison between those, as well as the individual products has to be executed by hand.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{intelligent}} shopping agents has grown {{as a result}} of the vast amount of information available to internet consumers. However, most of the currently available intelligent shopping agents only request consumers to define the criteria of the product in terms of price range and product features required. In order to satisfy internet consumers' needs, intelligent agents should also consider more aspects. Usually, before internet consumers make buying decisions, they may consider several psychological factors such as whether they like: famous brand name products; new style products; high-quality products, same products; lower-price products, etc. They may not only consider product features but also different businesses have different e-marketing mix elements, namely Product, Price, Promotion, Place, Personalization, Privacy, Customer Service, Community, Site, Security and Sales Promotion, which target different customers' preferences. In this research, four new streams are integrated: 1) Discovery of new psychological factors in the E-Commerce environment, 2) The relationship between psychological factors and e-marketing mix elements, 3) Creation of an ontology to codify the relationship between psychological factors and e-marketing mix elements and then 4) Development of an intelligent <b>shopping</b> <b>agent</b> based on the ontology. The intelligent <b>shopping</b> <b>agent</b> can provide services to both businesses and consumers such that businesses can acquire their target customers and at the same time customers can get their ideal business web sites to buy their desired products by mapping the psychological factors of internet consumers with businesses' e-marketing mix elements.

40|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} defining feature of the Semantic Web is machine-usable content. By this definition, the Semantic Web is already manifest in <b>shopping</b> <b>agents</b> that automatically access and use Web content to find the lowest air fares, or book prices. But where are the semantics? Most people regard the Semantic Web as a vision, not a reality—so <b>shopping</b> <b>agents</b> should not “count”. To use Web content, machines {{need to know what}} to do when they encounter it. This in turn, requires the machine to “know” what the content means (i. e. its semantics). The challenge of developing the Semantic Web is how to put this knowledge into the machine. The manner in which this is done is at the heart of the confusion about the Semantic Web. The goal of this paper is to clear up some of this confusion. We proceed by describing a variety of meanings of the term “semantics”, noting various things that can be said to have semantics of various kinds. We introduce a semantic continuum ranging from implicit semantics, which are only in the heads of the people who use the terms, to formal semantics for machine processing. We list some core requirements for enabling machines to use Web content, and we consider various issues such as hardwiring, agreements, clarity of semantics specifications, and public declarations of semantics.

40|$|Recently, we have {{experienced}} an emergence of comparative “Internet <b>Shopping</b> <b>Agents</b> ” (ISAs) that allow consumers to costlessly search across many online retailers and buy {{at the lowest}} price. An ISA {{can be thought of}} as an institution that creates all or nothing type of competition in the following sense: Because consumers see all the retail prices with a single search, a retailer of a homogenous good should get all the demand if it charged the lowest price in the ISA, but should get absolutely nothing if it charged a price that was even slightly higher. One would expect these ISAs to reduce frictions and lead sellers of homogenous goods (CDs, books and videos) who join the institution to be subjected to intense price competition. Yet many Internet retailers have rushed to join these ISAs. There is also ample evidence that instead of charging uniform prices, the prices charged by retailers inside the ISA vary substantially for any given consumer search. Furthermore, while some retailers do join ISAs, there are also others who simultaneously elect to stay out and not join <b>shopping</b> <b>agents.</b> This paper offers a rationale for the above phenomenon. It traces out the set of economic forces that govern the emergence and functioning of these ISAs and their effect on market competition.
