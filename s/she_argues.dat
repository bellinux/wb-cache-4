5|$|From {{this model}} of Kantian ethics, O'Neill begins to develop a theory of justice. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> that the {{rejection}} of certain principles, such as deception and coercion, provides {{a starting point for}} basic conceptions of justice, which <b>she</b> <b>argues</b> are more determinate for human beings that the more abstract principles of equality or liberty. Nevertheless, she concedes that these principles may seem to be excessively demanding: there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non-universalisable principles, such as injury.|$|E
5|$|According to Susan Brownmiller, mass rape {{during wartime}} {{is not a}} new phenomenon. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> that what was unique to the Bangladesh Liberation War was that the {{international}} community, for the first time, recognised that systematic rape {{could be used as a}} weapon to terrorise the people.|$|E

As Sally decides to leave the party early, Harry appears and {{declares}} his love for her. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> {{that the only reason}} he is there is because he is lonely, but he lists the many things he realized he loves about her. They kiss and marry three months later.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{writes that}} Oprah Winfrey's {{promotion}} of Night {{came at a}} difficult time for the genre of memoir, after a previous book-club author, James Frey, {{was found to have}} fabricated parts of his autobiography, A Million Little Pieces (2003). <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> that Winfrey's choice of Night may have been intended to restore the book club's credibility. Night has a useful lesson to teach, Franklin writes, about the complexities of memoir and memory.|$|E
5|$|Once {{they are}} all assembled, the Simpson family sit down to Thanksgiving dinner. When Lisa places the {{centerpiece}} on the table, <b>she</b> <b>argues</b> with Bart about where it should go {{since there is no}} room left for the turkey. In the ensuing fight, Bart accidentally throws the centerpiece into the fireplace and it burns up. Devastated, Lisa runs to her room crying, while Bart is sent to his room by his parents for causing the incident.|$|E
50|$|In March 2011, {{she wrote}} a paper for the liberal {{think-tank}} CentreForum in which <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> {{for an end to}} bias against serious academic subjects in the education system so that social mobility can be improved. Truss wrote a further paper for the same think-tank in May 2012, in which <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> for change {{in the structure of the}} childcare market in Britain.|$|R

5|$|Palmer {{begins by}} {{defending}} {{the claim that}} animals have moral standing, and then surveys three key approaches to animal ethics; utilitarian approaches, animal rights approaches, and capabilities approaches. All are lacking, <b>she</b> <b>argues,</b> as they are fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus unable to properly take account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, most significantly, causal.|$|E
5|$|Rowland (2009) {{identified}} {{an additional}} mechanism of countershading not previously analysed, namely that a round {{body like a}} cylinder illuminated and seen from above appears to have dark sides. Using a graphics tool, she demonstrated that this effect can be flattened out by countershading. Since predators are known to use edges to identify prey, countershading may therefore, <b>she</b> <b>argues,</b> make prey harder to detect when seen from above.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer (2000), on {{the other}} hand, reacts against this {{commonly}} held view and comments {{that the vast majority}} of the runestones were raised in memory of people who are not reported to have died abroad. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> that few men who went abroad were honoured with memorials and the reason is that the runestones were mainly raised because of concerns at home, such as inheritance issues. Such concerns would have arisen when a family knew that a relative would not return from abroad.|$|E

60|$|So <b>she</b> <b>argued,</b> in {{anguish and}} tears. Then <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> the {{opposite}} theory, but made a weak, poor business of it, and lost the case. <b>She</b> kept the <b>arguing</b> up, {{one side and}} then the other, {{the rest of the}} night, and at last fell asleep at dawn; fell in the fire at dawn, one may say; for that kind of sleep resembles fire, and one comes out of it with his brain baked and his physical forces fried out of him.|$|R
5000|$|<b>She</b> <b>argued</b> that {{it should}} be legally {{possible}} to confine children who were [...] "feeble-minded" [...] and the Mental Deficiency Act 1913 and the Elementary Education Act 1914 enabled this to happen. <b>She</b> <b>argued</b> {{that the only way to}} remove [...] "this evil" [...] was by preventing it. By 1910 <b>she</b> was <b>arguing</b> that the worst danger was not the worst, but the mild cases of feeble-mindedness. She foresaw that these people could hide their problems and by using this device they could transmit their problems to the children of society.|$|R
5|$|Some {{branches}} of feminism closely track the political leanings {{of the larger}} society, such as liberalism and conservatism, or focus on the environment. Liberal feminism seeks individualistic equality {{of men and women}} through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg has argued that the neoliberal shirt in Liberal feminism has led to that form of feminism being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality. Due to this <b>she</b> <b>argues</b> that Liberal Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.|$|E
5|$|The theologian Sallie McFague {{believes}} that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased secularisation of society. She notes that human experience is of this world rather than regular encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, <b>she</b> <b>argues,</b> religious language is both idolatrous because it fails to express sufficient awe of God, and irrelevant because without adequate words it becomes meaningless.|$|E
5|$|When the Seanchan {{attack the}} White Tower, its {{fractured}} state prevents an effective defense. Many Aes Sedai are captured or killed until Egwene, leading {{a group of}} novices, succeeds in driving them off. Siuan Sanche, Gawyn Trakand, and Gareth Bryne mount a rescue of Egwene. They find her so exhausted that she cannot protest when they extract her against her orders. After awakening in the camp, <b>she</b> <b>argues</b> {{that they may have}} ruined her chances to gain credit in the Tower for the defeat of the Seanchan.|$|E
2500|$|Kellor, {{speaking}} for the NAC in 1916, proposed to combine efficiency and patriotism in her Americanization programs. It would be more efficient, <b>she</b> <b>argued,</b> once the factory workers could all understand English and therefore better understand orders and avoid accidents. Once Americanized, they would grasp American industrial ideals and be open to American influences and not subject only to strike agitators or foreign propagandists. The result, <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> would transform indifferent and ignorant residents into understanding voters, to make their homes into American homes, and to establish American standards of living throughout the ethnic communities. Ultimately, <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> it would [...] "unite foreign-born and native alike in enthusiastic loyalty to our national ideals of liberty and justice.|$|R

5|$|After Boisselier {{announced}} that {{no evidence of}} the cloning would be provided, journalists became very skeptical of her story. While discussing Boisselier's management of Clonaid, Palmer notes {{that it is impossible}} to know why she stated that a clone was produced but then refused to provide evidence. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> that her refusal to provide evidence may have been because she organized a hoax, did not wish to publicize the birth of an unhealthy child, or was taken advantage of by a scientist she had hired. American science journalist Steven S. Hall criticized the media for their coverage of Clonaid, believe that they were inarticulately represented as a credible group. He speculates that the coverage of Boisselier and other cloning adherents galvanized sentiment against cloning, leading to its banning in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Clinton, a Senator and {{candidate}} for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, became the first American woman to win a presidential primary. Traister discusses Clinton's political campaign, which did not focus on her gender, and the misogynistic reactions she received from the media and political opponents. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> that the Democratic Party's lack of response to the sexism of Clinton's opponents led {{a large number of}} liberal female voters to abandon the party, and blames Mark Penn for advising Clinton not to advertise herself as a feminist. Although she originally supported John Edwards' candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, she became a strong supporter of Clinton.|$|E
5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> for rationality, pointing out that Burke's system {{would lead to the}} continuation of slavery, simply because it had been an ancestral tradition. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she says is genuine feeling, to Burke's false feeling.|$|E

Justice Elena Kagan also wrote a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Ginsburg joined in full, where <b>she</b> <b>argued</b> that the majority's ruling [...] "creates unfortunate incentives for the police".|$|R

5|$|In {{his paper}} The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, philosopher Michael Stocker {{challenges}} Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) {{by arguing that}} actions from duty lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out of duty, rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing. Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting {{a number of reasons}} that we might find acting out of duty objectionable, <b>she</b> <b>argues</b> that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is. Acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong, but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal: one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships. Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive—that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> that, seen this way, duty neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship. For Baron, being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act; rather, it entails that considerations of duty are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from duty.|$|E
5|$|Like other conduct {{books of}} the time, Thoughts adapts older genres to the new middle-class ethos. The book {{encourages}} mothers to teach their daughters analytical thinking, self-discipline, honesty, contentment in their social position, and marketable skills (in case they should ever need to support themselves). These goals reveal Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to John Locke; however, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his. Her aim is to educate women to be useful wives and mothers, because, <b>she</b> <b>argues,</b> it is through these roles that they can most effectively contribute to society. The predominantly domestic role Wollstonecraft outlines for womena role that she viewed as meaningfulwas interpreted by 20th-century feminist literary critics as paradoxically confining them to the private sphere.|$|E
5|$|Often {{categorized}} as a rationalist philosopher, Wollstonecraft demonstrates {{her commitment to}} and appreciation of feeling in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. <b>She</b> <b>argues</b> that subjective experiences, such as the transcendent emotions prompted by the sublime and the beautiful, possess a value equal to the objective truths discovered through reason. In Wollstonecraft's earlier works, reason was paramount, because it allowed access to universal truths. In Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, however, reason serves {{as a tool for}} reflection, mediating between the sensual experiences of the world and an abstract notion of truth (not necessarily universal truth). Maturation is not only the acquisition of reason—the view Wollstonecraft had adopted in Original Stories from Real Life (1788)—but also an understanding of when and how to trust one's emotions.|$|E
