5000|$|The work {{reflects}} {{the text of}} the Book of Revelation, which states that the Book of Judgement is sealed with seven seals, and describes the events that take places as each <b>seal</b> <b>is</b> <b>broken.</b> The breaking of the sixth seal triggers [...] "the great day of his wrath" [...] depicted in the second painting, followed by the last judgement after the seventh <b>seal</b> <b>is</b> <b>broken.</b>|$|E

50|$|This {{substance}} {{was first}} prepared by Edward Frankland during {{his work with}} Robert Bunsen in 1849 at the University of Marburg. After heating a mixture of zinc and methyl iodide in an airtight vessel, a flame burst out when the <b>seal</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken.</b> In the laboratory, this synthesis method remains unchanged today, except that copper or copper compounds are used to activate the zinc.|$|R

6000|$|It had <b>been</b> <b>sealed,</b> but the <b>seal</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken.</b> She {{opened it}} on the spot, {{to make sure that}} she had {{actually}} possessed herself of the Trust before leaving the room. The end of the letter was the first part of it she turned to. It came to its conclusion high on the third page, and it was signed by Noel Vanstone. Below the name these lines were added in the admiral's handwriting: ...|$|R

50|$|It was {{necessary}} to break the seal in order to open and read the letter, and so its arrival with the seal intact showed {{that it had not}} been intercepted or tampered with. However, once the <b>seal</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken,</b> it could no longer confirm the authenticity of the document. The original charters of Edward the Confessor can be considered to be a form of letters close, as they were delivered wrapped, with the seal hanging down.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>seal</b> <b>is</b> <b>broken</b> and {{the first}} of the four living creatures {{introduces}} a white horse whose crowned rider, equipped with a bow, goes out to conquer.|$|E

50|$|Simply {{loosening}} {{the lid of}} a vacuum-packed {{food product}} to break the seal is enough to permit the bacteria and mold growth to resume. The amount of air inhaled into the container when the <b>seal</b> <b>is</b> <b>broken</b> is small, but sufficient to permit slow growth of contaminating and decomposing organisms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Meaning that yo' don't care {{to see me}} NOW, co'nnle," [...] {{she said}} lightly, with a faint twinkle in her wise, sweet eyes. [...] "I thought of that, but as my {{business}} wouldn't wait, I brought it to yo'." [...] She took from {{the folds of her}} gown a letter. To his utter amazement it was the one he had given his overseer to post to the commandant that morning. To his greater indignation the <b>seal</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken.</b>|$|R
60|$|You {{remember}} how <b>seals</b> <b>were</b> <b>broken,</b> and impressed again, at the Roman post-office, {{in the revolutionary}} days when we were both young men? Thanks to the knowledge then obtained, the extraordinary events which once associated Mr. Winterfield and Miss Eyrecourt are at last plainly revealed to me. Copies of the papers are in my possession, and the originals <b>are</b> <b>sealed</b> again, with {{the crest of the}} proprietor of the asylum, as if nothing had happened. I make no attempt to excuse myself. You know our motto:--THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS.|$|R

50|$|One {{recommended}} {{method of}} removal {{is using a}} fingernail or other flat, blunt object to break the seal of the oral sucker at the anterior end of the leech, repeating with the posterior end, then flicking the leech away. As the fingernail is pushed along the person's skin against the leech, the suction of the sucker's <b>seal</b> <b>is</b> <b>broken,</b> {{at which point the}} leech will detach its jaws.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, cooking {{dough is}} {{spread over the}} container, like a lid, to seal the foods. This is known as pardah (veil), but on cooking becomes a bread which has absorbed the {{flavours}} {{of the food and}} the two are best eaten together. In the end, dum pukht food is about aroma, when the <b>seal</b> <b>is</b> <b>broken</b> on the table and the fragrance of a Persian repast floats in the air.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{submerged}} floating tunnels {{is based on}} well-known technology applied to floating bridges and offshore structures, but the construction is mostly {{similar to that of}} immersed tunnels: One way is to build the tube in sections in a dry dock; then float these to the construction site and sink them into place, while sealed; and, when the sections are fixed to each other, the <b>seals</b> <b>are</b> <b>broken.</b> Another possibility <b>is</b> to build the sections unsealed, and after welding them together, pump the water out.|$|R

Condorcet has vanished into darkness; perhaps, like Rabaut, sits between two walls, {{in the house of}} a friend.|$|R
5000|$|A Flexplay disc is {{shipped in}} a vacuum-sealed package. There {{is a clear}} dye inside the disc, {{contained}} within the bonding resin of the disc, which reacts with oxygen. When the <b>seal</b> <b>is</b> <b>broken</b> on the vacuum-packed disc, the layer changes from clear to black in about 48 hours, rendering the disc unplayable. If unopened, the shelf life of the sealed package {{is said to be}} [...] "about a year". The DVD plastic also has a red dye in it, which prevents penetration of the disc by blue lasers, which would go straight through the oxygen-reactive dye.|$|E
50|$|Lenneth {{finds the}} other earring at Platina's grave and her {{memories}} as Platina return. Sensing that the <b>seal</b> <b>is</b> <b>broken,</b> Odin performs the Sovereign's Rite, transmigrating Lenneth's soul and summoning Hrist. Hrist takes {{control of the}} valkyrie's body and tries to destroy her companions Arngrim and Mystina, who refuse to serve her, but Lenneth intervenes. The blast shatters Lenneth's soul and Mystina crystallizes the fragments {{to prevent them from}} dissipating. With the help of another collected companion, her soul is fused with the valkyrie's body and Lenneth is reborn. Her memories of Lucian and Platina intact, Lenneth is disgusted with how the gods manipulate humans and the suffering they cause.|$|E
50|$|Black {{and other}} {{minorities}} at OSP have an acute problem with the librarian {{when it comes to}} their gaining access to courts. First we recognize racism is an ingrained traditional attitude. And second, prisons are reflections of those views. Therefore, Blacks and others in their own wherewithal struggle towards the path of freedom through redress in our courts. But quite often the librarian tries to preclude these efforts in many different ways. Such as telling prisoners his notary <b>seal</b> <b>is</b> <b>broken</b> and of course this tactic will go on for two or three weeks until one of the counselors puts a stop to it, being that if the librarian doesn't notarize documents they will have to do his job.|$|E
50|$|Screwcaps {{on glass}} or plastic bottles <b>are</b> <b>sealed</b> with a ring {{at the bottom}} of the cap {{attached}} by perforation. Twisting the cap has the effect of rupturing the material between the perforations and indicating that the original <b>seal</b> has <b>been</b> <b>broken.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the coking process, {{a laborer}} would level the {{deposited}} coal {{through the side}} window using a scaper. Once the coal was ready, the side window would <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> with clay, leaving a 1 in opening to allow the entry of air. The process, which essentially involves heating bituminous coal in a closed chamber to remove its volatile material, took about 72 hours. At {{the end of the}} process, the clay <b>seal</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken,</b> and the coke was removed and placed on a train for shipment to an iron furnace in Chattanooga. Two tons of coal typically produced one ton of coke.|$|R

50|$|Rudy the Clown is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Wario Land 3. Rudy lures Wario into the music box world, claiming {{that he is the}} god of the world. He convinces Wario to help break the seal that was placed upon him by the other creatures of the world, with the promise of keeping any treasure Wario finds. After the <b>seal</b> <b>is</b> <b>broken,</b> Rudy reveals himself and attacks Wario. Wario defeats him, and the curse on the other inhabitants is broken. Rudy returns in the video game Dr. Mario 64, where he and Mad Scienstein concoct a plan to steal the Megavitamins from Dr. Mario because he has a cold, and wants the power to cure any illness.|$|E
50|$|The fifth <b>seal</b> <b>is</b> <b>broken,</b> and John {{reveals the}} choir of {{souls of the}} Christian martyrs beneath the altar, which cry out for vengeance upon the earth (Chorus: Der Aufruhr im Himmel). The voice of God bids them wait a little while until their {{brothers}} and fellow warriors shall join them. John tells of the sixth seal's opening, and behold, a great earthquake, deluge, and world-burning: {{the first part of}} the oratorio ends in a violently-agitated chorus (Der Weltuntergang), cut through by angular trumpet-figures, as the Moon goes red with blood, everything crashes in storms, the stars fall to earth, the sea overflows, the sun goes black, and all mankind comes together before the face of the God of Gods in the Day of Anger.|$|E
50|$|Rather {{than being}} a passive, remorseful {{observer}} of the tragic events, Jeremiah had in fact been just as corrupted as his siblings, having died and been resurrected during the war, and had just been using his old friend {{to get rid of}} his more powerful siblings so he could take Patrick's Gel'ziabar Stone and use it to siphon the power of the Undying King into himself, allowing Jeremiah to remake the world as he saw fit. Furious at his friend's treachery, Patrick beheads Jeremiah, but this proves to be a mistake, as with the last Covenant slain, the <b>seal</b> <b>is</b> <b>broken,</b> and the Undying King is released. The ground bursts open, releasing the mummified remains of the Celtic warrior who had been used to seal away the Undying King by the original druids, and the warrior quickly crumbles to dust. Then, the King itself, a hideous, insectoid monstrosity, finally breaches the walls to our reality.|$|E
30|$|Upon HDU admission, {{patients}} {{were randomly assigned}} in a ratio of 1 : 1 to be infused by the conventional insulin infusion system or by the optimised system with dedicated insulin infusion. Randomisation was carried out using sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes containing treatment group assignments obtained from computer-generated random numbers provided by an independent statistician. The patient was declared randomised when the <b>seal</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken.</b> The HDU pharmacist opened the envelope when the patient left the operating room and was directly hospitalised in the HDU unit. After randomisation, the HDU nurse set up the appropriate infusion line and the iPro 2 device.|$|R

50|$|On 24 June 1646, the king's {{stronghold of}} Oxford was {{surrendered}} to Sir Thomas Fairfax, with Lane acting {{for the king}} to negotiate terms. He failed to retain control of the Great Seal, the seals of various other courts, and the Sword of State. Having obtained them all, Fairfax sent them to parliament, which on 3 July resolved to have the Great Seal destroyed. On 11 August the <b>seal</b> <b>was</b> <b>broken</b> up by a smith. However, after the execution of Charles I in 1649, Charles II renewed Lane's patent as nominal Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, a position he held until his death.|$|R
