30|$|Se 2 (CIGS) {{thin film}} solar cells {{attracted}} a big attention owing to their high {{power conversion efficiency}} (21.7 %) and good stability. On the other side, these materials represent a potential environmental problem because of selenium toxicity, indium and gallium limited availability, and high price [2 – 6]. Kesterite Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 (CZTS) and stannite Cu 2 FeSnS 4 (CFTS) provide promising alternatives to CIGS, because of their environmental acceptance (application of sulfur instead of selenium) and economic advantages (application of earth-abundant iron, zinc, and tin instead of scarce indium and gallium). However, in comparison with CIGS, their power conversion efficiency is lower (12.6 and 7.2 % for CZTS and CFTS, respectively [2, 3, 7]). There are several “classical” methods to synthesize CZTS and CFTS nanocrystals, like electrochemical, vacuum and thermal deposition, electron beam evaporation, magnetron <b>sputtering,</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis, pulse laser deposition, and sol-gel method [5, 8]. Besides them, other methods like microwave treatment [9, 10], solvothermal synthesis [11 – 14], hot-injection [15 – 17], electrospinning [18], and dip-coating [19] were successfully applied.

In some cases this reflectance is undesired in optical layer systems consisting of many individual elements. Several techniques such as magnetron <b>sputtering,</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis, sol-gel, and chemical vapor deposition {{can be used to}} prepare anti-reflection thin films. Main drawbacks of magnetron sputtering preparation of anti-reflection film systems on glass substrates are connected with low deposition rates and long – term stability of films.

40|$|Graphene, {{with its}} {{two-dimensional}} nature and unique properties, has {{for over a}} decade captured enormous interests in both industry and academia. This work tries to answer the question of what would happen to graphene when it is subjected to various processing conditions and how this would affect the graphene functionality. The focus is placed on its ability to withstand different thin-film deposition environments with regard to the implementation of graphene in two application areas: as a diffusion barrier and in electronic devices. With single-layer graphene films grown in-house by means of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), four techniques among the well-established thin-film deposition methods are studied in detail: atomic layer deposition (ALD), evaporation, sputter-deposition and spray-deposition. And in this order, these methods span a large range of kinetic impact energies from low to high. Graphene is known to have a threshold displacement energy of 22 eV above which carbon atoms are ejected from the lattice. Thus, ALD and evaporation work with energies below this threshold, while <b>sputtering</b> and <b>spraying</b> may involve energies above. The quality of the graphene films undergone the various depositions is mainly evaluated using Raman spectroscopy. Spray deposition of liquid alloy Ga-In-Sn is shown to require a stack of at least 4 layers of graphene in order to act as an effective barrier to the Ga diffusion after the harsh spray-processing. Sputter-deposition is found to benefit from low substrate temperature and high chamber pressure (thereby low kinetic impact energy) so as to avoid damaging the graphene. Reactive sputtering should be avoided. Evaporation is non-invasiveness with low kinetic impact energy and graphene can be subjected to repeated evaporation and removal steps without losing its integrity. With ALD, the effects on graphene are of different nature and they are investigated in the field-effect-transistor (FET) configuration. The ALD process for deposition of Al 2 O 3 films is found to remove undesired dopants from the prior processing and the Al 2 O 3 films are shown to protect the graphene channel from doping by oxygen.

Polycrystalline CdS/CdSe films {{have been made by}} <b>sputtering</b> and solution <b>spraying,</b> compound evaporation, chemical vapor deposition, and many others. A recent technique involves the electrochemical deposition of CdS and CdSe from nonaqueous solvents. Preparation of these films is based upon the cathodic deposition from a nonaqueous solution of a cadmium salt and elemental sulfur and/or selenium. Although the technique is simple, no mechanistic information is known to optimize the conditions in which films of controlled stoichiometry, doping and crystallinity are made. This research has the purpose to understand the mechanism of the formation of polycrystalline films of CdS and CdSe by electrochemical deposition in dimethylsulfoxide. This approach to the problem makes use of electrochemical techniques such as rotating ring disc electrode, linear scan voltammetry, high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet and electrochemical detection. By the rotating ring disc electrode technique, we have studied the kinetic parameters for the reduction of sulfur, selenium, cadmium, and the electroChemical formation of CdS and CdSe for temperatures from 25 - lOO°C. The results show that rates of initie. l electron transfer for the reduction of these species are moderately rapid, and secondly, that the reverse reaction is irreversible and involves additional steps. Studies of solubility of selenium with temperature reveal that its solubility is enhanced by the addition of sulfur. Understanding the electrochemical behavior of sulfur-selenium mixtures is of great importance to produce mixed semiconductive films with more adequate bandgaps for use with solar spectrum. Electrochemistry of sulfur-selenium mixtures are no different from that of sulfur alone.

The advantages of renewable energy like higher sustainability, lesser maintenance, low cost of operation, and minimal impact on the environment make the role of renewable energy sources significant. Out of the various renewable energy sources like solar energy, wind energy, hydropower, biogas, tidal and geothermal, usage of solar energy is gradually increasing. Among various solar energy sources, Photovoltaics has dominated {{over the past two decades}} since it is free clean energy and availability of abundant sunlight on earth. Over the past few decades, thin film solar cells (TFSC) have gained considerable interest as an economically feasible alternative to conventional silicon (Si) photovoltaic devices. TFSCs have the potential to be as efficient as Si solar cells both in terms of conversion efficiency as well as cost. The advantages of TFSC are that they are easy to prepare, lesser thickness, requires lesser materials, light weight, low cost and opto-electronic properties can be tuned by varying the process parameters. The present study is focused on the fabrication of AgInS 2 /ZnS heterojunction thin film solar cell. AgInS 2 absorber layer is deposited using both vacuum (sputtering/sulfurization) and non-vacuum (ultrasonic spray pyrolysis) techniques. ZnS window layer is prepared using thermal evaporation technique, detailed experimental investigation has been conducted and the results have been reported in this work. The thesis is divided into 6 chapters. Chapter 1 gives general introduction about solar cells and working principle of solar cell. It also discusses thin film solar cell technology and its advantages. Layers of thin film solar cell structure, Significance of each layers and possible materials to be used are emphasized. A detailed overview of the available literature on both AgInS 2 absorber layer and ZnS window layer has been presented. Based on the literature review, objectives of the present work are defined. Chapter 2 explains the theory and experimental details of deposition techniques used for the growth of AgInS 2 and ZnS films. Details of characterization techniques to study film properties are described in detail. Chapter 3 presents a systematic study of AgInS 2 thin films deposited by sulfurization of sputtered Ag-In metallic precursors. Initially, AgInS 2 films are deposited by varying the substrate temperature and properties of as-deposited films are characterized. Structural, morphological, electrical and optical properties of AgInS 2 films are explained. From these studies, samples with better properties at particular substrate temperature are optimized. By fixing the substrate temperature, deposition time of silver is varied by keeping other deposition conditions same and the properties of films are discussed. It was observed that deposition time of silver doesn’t have much impact on structural properties of AgInS 2 films. However, opto-electric properties of AgInS 2 films are enhanced. Based on characterization studies, deposition time of silver is optimized. Deposition time of indium is varied by keeping substrate temperature and silver deposition to optimized value. The properties of as-deposited films are discussed. Based on the above studies, the optimized p type films have a band gap of 1. 64 eV, carrier concentration of 1013 ions/cm 3 and Resistivity of order 103 Ω-cm. Chapter 4 presents a systematic study of AgInS 2 thin films deposited by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. AgInS 2 films are deposited by varying the substrate temperature and properties of as deposited films are characterized. Structural, morphological, electrical and optical properties of AgInS 2 films are explained. From these studies, samples with better properties at particular substrate temperature are optimized. By fixing the substrate temperature, concentration of silver molarity in the precursor solution is varied by keeping other deposition conditions same and the properties of films are discussed. Structural, optical and electrical properties of AgInS 2 films are enhanced with the increase in silver concentration. Based on characterization studies, concentration of silver is optimized. Similarly concentration of indium molarity in the precursor solution is varied and the properties of as-deposited films are discussed. Finally, sulfur molarity in the precursor solution is varied and properties of films are discussed. It was observed that increasing sulfur after certain limit does not have any effect on the properties of the films. Based on the above studies, this method resulted in the films with resistivity of 103 Ω-cm and band gap of 1. 64 eV. These films showed a carrier concentration of 1013 ions/cm 3. Chapter 5 describes the growth of ZnS films using thermal evaporation technique. Influence of thickness on the properties of ZnS films is explained. Samples with good crystallinity, high transmission, and wider gap are selected for device fabrication. This p type layer showed a band gap of 3. 52 eV.
