5|$|The {{causes of}} Bolckow, Vaughan's failure included: poor {{decision-making}} {{in the period}} from 1900–1910 which delayed the introduction of improved steelmaking technology; optimistic belief in promises of funding made by the British government during the war, leading to excessive reliance on costly bank loans in 1918, instead of issuing share capital (as the firm later did in 1919 and 1923); failure to diversify into profitable <b>steel</b> <b>products</b> such as pipes, sheet steel and shipbuilding plates; and failure to invest in its own coal mines to provide enough for steel production, and for cash. There were thus both long-term and short-term failures of strategy.|$|E

25|$|The {{manufacturing}} sector, already well-developed {{before the}} Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965, {{was given a}} major stimulus by the imposition of United Nations sanctions.

40|$|Most of the {{products}} purchased in the UK are manufactured in other countries. As a result, worldwide greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions released to manufacture all products purchased in the UK are {{significantly higher than the}} UK territorial emissions. More than one half of global industrial emissions result from the use of steel, cement, paper, plastics, and aluminium. In this paper, the UK consumption of products that embody these five materials is estimated. For steel, which is the most widely used among these five materials, consumption and accumulation patterns are examined across four product categories. The impact of <b>steel</b> <b>product</b> lifetime extension is examined for the UK as one option for material demand reduction at the consumption stage of the supply chain. Different levels of <b>steel</b> <b>product</b> lifetimes are simulated for the UK in 2050 and their impacts are examined in terms of UK steel production, implicit steel imports, and global carbon dioxide emissions. <b>Steel</b> <b>product</b> lifetime extension promotes a reduction in the need for steel imports, by reducing the demand for new steel, which leads to lower carbon dioxide emissions required to supply the UK steel demand. The results demonstrate the criticality of a focus on the consumption stage, since any interventions made towards demand reduction of end-use goods leads to material reduction across the supply chain...|$|R
