However, it is not clear why there are often violations of <b>grazing</b> <b>restrictions</b> in equilibrium. This paper first presents a theoretical framework of collective action in community management of grazing lands that explicitly models individual violations behaviour. Then data from the highlands of Amhara region of Ethiopia are used to test the model predictions to examine the impact of policy-relevant factors on collective establishment of <b>grazing</b> <b>restrictions</b> and violations of <b>grazing</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Econometric results show that collective action in community grazing land management is likely to be more beneficial and effective in communities with better market access or higher populations. Collective action, on the other hand, is less likely to be successful in communities with greater social, economic, or cultural heterogeneity or more affluent members. Factors related to greater livestock profitability, such as rainfall, or fixed costs of negotiating agreements, such as total land area of the community, have ambiguous effects, as they are associated with establishment of <b>grazing</b> <b>restrictions</b> as well as violating the restrictions.

30|$|Conservancies {{influence}} grazing {{strategies in}} a number of ways. All conservancies have controlled grazing plans that set rules for within their boundaries. These usually restrict the number of livestock allowed into the conservancy and the areas where and the periods in which they can graze. Grazing plans vary by conservancy, but livestock grazing is generally restricted in areas surrounding tourist camps, to maintain higher quantities of grass and avoid livestock being visible to, or heard by, guests. Periodic grazing is allowed in areas farther away. Conservancies usually allow more flexible grazing during the low tourism season when some camps may be closed or during severe droughts. Some conservancies organise their grazing using a single but large grazing herd, opening up different parts of the conservancy in succession for grazing. Usually, cattle herds neighbouring the conservancy are allowed access on a rotational basis, as different parts of the conservancy are open for grazing at different times. Sheep and goats, which tend to graze close to their bomas, are not allowed access. Grazing is usually permitted only during the day for ease of monitoring and to avoid conflict with predators. Grazing rules are monitored and enforced by conservancy rangers, and herd owners are fined if herds are caught grazing in the conservancy outside of the specified times and places. Herds are driven out of the conservancy to the ranger post or gate and impounded until the fine is paid. In some cases, herders or livestock owners caught grazing illegally in the conservancies have been imprisoned or given community service (KII 32; Naboisho 2013). The commonest reason given for the strict <b>grazing</b> <b>restrictions</b> was the fact that tourism investors do not want cattle in the conservancies (KII 14, 18, 32). Where conservancies initially completely outlawed livestock grazing, some persuasion was required to convince the tourism investors to allow it to some level (KII 14). Although <b>grazing</b> <b>restrictions</b> applied to both conservancy members and non-members, there was discussion that when conservancies do allow livestock grazing, conservancy members’ livestock received preferential access (KII 16, 26; CI 8, 17, 19, 29).|$|R

In areas with a degraded environment, farmers were eager to implement policies to improve the environment and recognized the positive impact of the grazing ban policy (GBP). However, as conditions improved, farmers’ recognition and acceptance of the GBP became negative. Although farmers recognized the benefits of the GBP, they showed little awareness of the long-term process of environmental governance. As can be seen from the farmers’ ecological awareness and their attitudes toward the GBP, they are more inclined to value short-term economic interest than ecological protection.

30|$|The conservancies’ <b>grazing</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{have also}} likely put {{pressure}} on the MMNR as a livestock-grazing resource. The heavy use of the MMNR for livestock grazing and its importance during dry periods found here highlight the importance of the MMNR as a grazing resource, even though illegal. Although livestock have historically used the reserve during drought times, recent studies have shown an increasing use of the MMNR by cattle (Ogutu et al. 2011) and even pastoralists preferring to graze inside the MMNR rather than the conservancies to maintain their eligibility of payment by a conservancy (Butt 2011). Although most grazing in the MMNR reported here was during the night, there is a considerable recent surge in regular illegal livestock grazing in the MMNR during both the daytime and night-time (Joseph Ogutu, personal observation 2017). Also of concern is the unprecedented and widespread {{increase in the number of}} fences (Løvschal et al. 2017) and emergence of new sites of elevated settlement densities, in part linked to the reduction in livestock-grazing areas and redistribution of settlements following the establishment of conservancies. These points question the conservation effectiveness of conservancies, and conservancies will be less effective in promoting wildlife conservation if conservancy earnings are invested in purchasing more livestock or erecting fences, or if livestock numbers, fencing and illegal livestock incursions into the Mara Reserve are not effectively regulated.|$|R
40|$|Calico scale, an {{invasive}} {{soft scale}} pest of shade and ornamental trees, has reached outbreak levels in Kentucky {{and elsewhere in}} the eastern United States (1, 2). Heavily infested trees suffer branch tieback and may be severely stressed or killed. In spring, maturing females produce copious honeydew that attracts wasps and other nuisance insects and promotes growth of unsightly sooty mold. Honeydew falling on parked vehicles, decks, or other objects may require removal of infested trees. Hosts include sugar and Norway maple, sweetgum, honey locust, Japanese zelkova, dogwood, crabapples, and other cultivated trees, as well as wild hackberry. Calico scale is univoltine, overwintering as second instars on twigs, branches, and trunks and molting to the adult stage in late March to mid-April in Kentucky (1). Females each produce several thousand eggs that hatch in mid- to late May. Crawlers disperse for 2 − 3 weeks and nearly all of them settle on leaves by mid-June. Settled crawlers molt to second instars in mid-summer which continue feeding on leaves until just before leaf abscission in autumn when they move to overwintering sites on bark. In Kentucky, calico scale is a particular problem on horse farms where rows of single tree species are planted in narrow grassy strips bordering pastures or paddocks.

40|$|Current {{intensified}} {{livestock production}} threatens global biodiversity and food security. Increasing {{the use of}} semi-natural, species-rich grasslands for grazing and hay-making {{could serve as a}} way to bridge biodiversity conservation and livestock production but we know little about the nutritional composition of native grasslands. To determine the effect of grassland biodiversity on forage quality and the potential benefits and limitations of using conservation grasslands for agriculture, I conducted ecological and ethnobotanical research at 30 grassland sites in Oxfordshire, England. Species-richness and composition increased forage dry matter, sugar, and Phosphorus (P) content. Forage from species-rich grasslands contained up to 27 % more protein, 56 % more Phosphorus (P), 106 % more Potassium (K), and 183 % more Calcium (Ca) than cereals and conventional hay and met the nutritional requirements of beef cattle, sheep, and horses. Farmers and graziers valued species-rich grasslands were (1) the medicinal effect of specific grassland plants on livestock, (2) affordability, (3) the resilience of species-rich grasslands to drought and flooding, (4) conservation, and (5) marketability of pastoral products. The main factors inhibiting the (continued or increased) agricultural use of species-rich grasslands were restrictions on time of <b>grazing,</b> <b>restrictions</b> on time of hay-cut, and reduced grassland yield and forage quality due to recent increases in invasive plants. More flexible agro-environmental guidelines around species-rich grassland use are necessary to balance the agricultural as well as ecological value of these landscapes...|$|R

The human-tiger {{conflict}} {{has become a}} major threat to long-term tiger survival and well being of local people living around tiger reserves. Mitigation of this conflict is considered most critical in multiple use forested areas where tiger ecological needs and human livelihood needs overlap. My thesis seeks {{to gain a better understanding}} of this conflict. I investigated ecological and sociological aspects of man-eating cases in and around Chitwan National Park Nepal, with an ultimate aim of guiding mitigation policies and management. Additionally, I investigated the impact of <b>grazing</b> <b>restrictions</b> on livestock husbandry practices, and also evaluated the people's perceptions and tolerance towards tigers in Madi Valley, within the Chitwan National Park. I obtained three decades of man-eating cases (1979 - 2006), each case was re-examined by visiting victim's families, or person present at the time of the incidents. Likewise, tiger's responsible for killing these people were also re-investigated by visiting Park veterinarian and zoo records. The site of each human kill and tiger removal was visited to measure habitat conditions when kills were made and where man-eating tigers occurred. A total of 36 tigers killed 88 people from 1979 - 2006. The trend of human loss increased from an average of 1. 21 persons per year prior to 1997 to 7. 22 per year since 1998. The rising trend is due to primarily increasing number of people killed in the buffer zones surrounding the Park. I classified the sex, age classes, condition of man-eating tigers, and also evaluated prey base at kill sites, and aggressiveness of tigers when people came to remove victims for cremation. Nearly half of the people killed were grass/fodder cutters. In chapter 3 the impact of <b>grazing</b> <b>restriction</b> on livestock husbandry practices is examined. Household survey data and secondary information measured the impact of changing access policies. Households needed to reduce their holdings of unproductive livestock and to switch to stall feeding. Higher stall feeding required local people to gather more fodder and increased human activities in the recovering forest may contribute to increase man-eating. In chapter 4 local people's beliefs about the importance of tiger and their tolerance levels is assessed from head of the household surveys. The value and tolerance levels are analyzed based on household demographics, resource use, and interaction with tigers. Local people highly value but only have moderate tolerance for tigers. Higher valuing and tolerance for tiger were significantly influenced by household's wealth. Furthermore, poor people were found to live closer to forest, use more forest resources, have high livestock depredation resulting in lower valuing and tolerance levels for tigers. To mitigate the conflict I recommend radio-collaring problem tigers (particularly in the buffer zone) to collect tigers behavioral and movement patterns to create 'no go' zone, continue long term tiger monitoring program by extending the cooperation of the local communities, implement a tiger conservation awareness to educate local people on tiger biology, and improve compensation program to increase local tolerance towards tiger...|$|R

Long duration <b>grazing</b> <b>restrictions</b> cause economic hardships in rural Nevada communities that depend on public land livestock grazing, yet land managers must consider multiple uses and the 24 functionality of riparian systems. Little research focuses on post-fire riparian response and how recovery varies among stream types or in relation to condition, attributes, and drivers. To quantify stream recovery, we use the protocol Multiple Indicator Monitoring (MIM) of Stream Channels and Streamside Vegetation (Burton et al. 2011). It is becoming a standard method for quantifying riparian objectives. We do so at 24 streams across Nevada BLM lands burned in 2012 fires. We focus on reaches of management concern (e. g., functional at-risk, threatened species habitat, or aspen stands). Five sites are recovering aspen stands and fifteen were rated as functional-at-risk during a proper functioning condition (PFC) assessment performed within ten years prior to the fire. Long term MIM indicators include greenline plant composition (stability rating and wetland indicator value), woody species height class, streambank stability and cover, woody species age class, and greenline-to-greenline width. We evaluate the predictive ability among indicators, and investigate how streams vary in response among stream types, grazing history, position in the watershed, hydrogeomorphic interactions, prior condition and phases of the gully evolution cycle...|$|R

The sparse-elm grassland of Horqin Sandy Land, China has suffered severe degradation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Management to exclude grazing is often necessary for ecological restoration, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. We report effects on vegetation and soils in a 10 -year experiment to exclude livestock, completely or seasonally, in comparison with a continuously grazed area in Horqin. Complete exclusion of <b>grazing</b> and <b>restriction</b> of <b>grazing</b> to summer both led to significantly increased plant cover and density relative to the grazed control.

40|$|The study {{dealt with}} four themes of {{importance}} for conservation of T. buxtoni (hereafter MN). Firstly distance sampling technique involving transects and total count methods were employed to assess population size and dynamics of MN. The study revealed that the total population size of MN {{in the study area}} varied between 887 - 965 individuals at 95 %CI, representing a reduction by about 48 % from what was reported in 1980 's and a reduction of about 74 % from what was reported for 1969. However, due to contraction of its habitat, average densities of MN have increased from what was reported in 1980 's. More than half (54 %) of the population is represented by adults and the population has the a sex ratio of 2 : 1 (~ : 0). The sub-population ofMN in Dinsho sanctuary is 'closed population' because no evidence was found to suggest that the D. insho sub-population is mixing with the rest. The study forecasts a continual decrease of MN population by a rate of about 2 % - 5 % annually if no action is taken to counteract it. No conclusive evidence was found to suggest that innate demographic traits of theÃ‚Â·species have made significant contribution to observed decline in population size as many parameters (i. e., recruitment, rate of increase, age structure except male adult and calves group, and group size) were similar in 1983 - 85 and 2003 - 05. Secondlv, randomly laid plots along transect lines were used to describe the basic components (vegetation types) of the MN habitat range and assess how MN relates to them. Accordingly six major vegetation types were recorded in Gaysay grassland habitat; among which Hypericum bush, mixed vegetations and Artemesia bush are the most selected and hence most preferred by MN. Similar numbers of vegetation types were recorded in AdelaylDinsho woodlands; among which, montane open grassland and Hypericum woodland are the most selected and thus preferred vegetation types by MN. When all vegetation types pooled together, levels of browsing decreases significantly with increase in vegetation height; while increases with increase in patch size. However, positive correlations were observed hetween levels of browsing and vegetation hlight for Helichrisum species; while negative correlation for Artemesia and open grassland in terms of patch size. Thirdlv, the effects of livestock and humans on availability, structure and composition ofMN habitat were investigated. The result revealed that presence of livestock and humans had negatively affected vegetation structure, composition and habitat availability to MN. Moreover, presence of livestock and their signs (droppings) were negatively correlated with presence of MN and their droppings. Fourthly, structured questionnaire and interviews directed to randomly selected households in 7 villages were used to assess the attitudes, and awareness of the local communities towards conservation of the park's flora and fauna with particular emphasis on MN. About a quarter of respondents (26 %) felt that they benefited while 55 % felt that they experienced conflict from the park. The most important benefits identified were leasing of horses to tourist's (62 %) and serving as tourist guide (44 %). Significant majority (83 %) of the respondents believes that there is lack of equity in benefit distribution. The main conflicts identified were resentment due to forceful relocation (84 %) and livestock <b>grazing</b> <b>restriction</b> (74 %). Perceived benefits and conflicts were significantly variable across livelihood strategy than proximity and duration of settlements. The majority of respondents (66 %) believe that their presence in the area does not contribute to degradation of MN habitat, an attitude more commonly held among recent settlers than long-term settlers. The overall attitude of the local people towards the park appeared to be positive since, for example, 80 % of respondents would support the park's conservation activities if given the chance, suggesting that there is scope to enhance cooperation and improve the-prospects for conservation of the MN and its habitat.

The composition and stain distributions in the InGaN epitaxial films are jointly measured by employing various x-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, including out-of-plane XRD at <b>special</b> planes, in-plane <b>grazing</b> incidence XRD, and reciprocal space mapping (RSM). It is confirmed that the measurement of (204) reflection allows a rapid access to estimate the composition without considering the influence of biaxial strain. The two-dimensional RSM checks composition and degree of strain relaxation jointly, revealing an inhomogeneous strain distribution profile along the growth direction. As the film thickness increases from 100 nm to 450 nm, the strain status of InGaN films gradually transfers from almost fully strained to fully relaxed state and then more in atoms incorporate into the film, while the near-interface region of InGaN films remains pseudomorphic to GaN...|$|R
40|$|Summary. A {{method for}} {{deriving}} {{the analysis of}} variance for an experiment is presented and applied to <b>grazing</b> trials. A <b>special</b> feature of <b>grazing</b> trials, specifically utilized by our method, is that they involve at least two randomizations: treatments are randomized to field units (for example paddocks or plots) and field units are randomized to animals. Randomization results in the confounding (‘mixing up’) of terms and our method includes separate terms {{in the analysis of}} variance table for confounded terms so that all sources of variability in the experiment have terms for them included in the table and the confounding between the sources of variability in the experiment is explicitly displayed in the table. This information is employed in determining the valid error terms and we will present examples that show how to ascertain these for effects of interest and hence which effects can be tested. In this it fulfils the same role as the contentious process of identifying the experimental unit. It will be demonstrated that the inclusion of separate terms for confounded terms results in improper replication in grazing trials being automatically signalled, and makes its ramifications clear...|$|R
40|$|The NASA Global Ocean Data Set {{of plant}} pigment {{concentrations}} in the upper euphotic zone is evaluated for diserning geographical and temporal patterns of seasonality in the open sea. Monthly medians of pigment concentrations for all available years are generated for fields of approximately 77, 000 sq km. For the climatological year, highest and lowest medians, month of occurence of the highest median, ratio of highest to lowest medians, and absolute range between the highest and lowest medians are mapped ocean-wide between 62. 5 deg N and 62. 5 deg S. Seasonal cycles are depicted for 48 sites. In much of the offshore ocean, seasonality of pigment is inferred to be driven almost equally by {{the interaction of the}} abiotic environment with phytoplankton physiology and the loss of cells from <b>grazing.</b> <b>Special</b> emphasis among natural domains or provinces is given to the Subantarctic water ring, with no seasonality in its low chlorophyll concentrations in spite of strong environmental forcing, and the narrow Transition Zones, a few degrees of latitude on the equatorial sides of the Subtropical Convergences of the southern hemisphere and their homologs in the northern hemisphere, which have late winter blooms caused by nutrient injection into the upper layers...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates China’s tuimu huancao and destocking policy under a Compensation for Ecosystem Services {{program as}} a case study of how “received wisdom” environmental degradation narratives are used to justify state interventions into the livelihoods of minority pastoralists. Tuimu huancao calls for <b>grazing</b> bans and <b>restrictions</b> by fencing for the purpose of restoring purportedly degraded rangeland and protecting rangeland. The destocking policy is intended to adjust herd size to carrying capacity through a reward mechanism for the purpose of protecting rangeland. It examines the scientific and theoretical foundations of these two policies {{and the way in which}} they are understood, received, negotiated, and contested in multiple ways through a case study from Nagchu Prefecture, Tibet. The framework for analyzing these two programs as state interventions draws from and contributes to political ecology. Field research of an ethnographic study used a mix of methods that included detailed household surveys, in-depth, semi-structured interviews, oral histories, focus groups, transect walks, participatory mapping and participant observation. This dissertation argues that tuimu huancao and the destocking policy ultimately have the effect more of intensifying existing policy directions that transform traditional pastoralism than of mitigating rangeland degradation, restoration and protection. Hence, narratives of rangeland degradation underpinning tuimu huancao and the destocking policy serve to justify state interventions that aim to achieve this goal of transforming traditional pastoralism. Furthermore, broadly defined political and economic forces maintain the persistence of “received wisdom” on pastoralism and prevent alternative perspectives to existing policy directions from emerging. This dissertation also argues that Tibetan pastoralism can be well adapted to state interventions based on a middle way approach that accommodates both development and the livestock components of pastoralism. Nonetheless, the dissertation demonstrates that the formation of such a policy will not be easy because it will be a political process and can be jeopardized by officials’ vested political and economic interests...|$|R
40|$|Most suids (Mammalia: Suidae, pigs) {{worldwide}} are omnivores {{living in}} closed environments, but the African warthog (Phacochoerus) has <b>special</b> adaptations for <b>grazing</b> in open environments. Similar specializations {{have been recorded}} from Plio-Pleistocene African suids. Four genera, Nyanzachoerus, Notochoerus, Kolpochoerus, and Metridiochoerus, have been discovered in late Miocene to middle Pleistocene locations around the Turkana Basin. We analyse the relative abundances of these four suid genera compared to other mammals, from approximately 8 - 0. 7 Ma. The dataset includes most of the mammal specimens collected from locations around the Kenyan side of the Turkana Basin. Species of genus Nyanzachoerus were dominant before 4 Ma, but their relative abundance decreases through time thereafter. At the same time, Notochoerus increases in relative abundance, followed by Kolpochoerus, and finally Metridiochoerus. Their peak relative abundances do not overlap: Notochoerus peaks at 3. 44 - 2. 53 Ma, Kolpochoerus at 2. 53 - 1. 87 Ma, and Metridiochoerus at 1. 38 - 0. 7 Ma. We interpret the palaeoecology of these suids based on their relative abundances over time and on published isotope and pollen data. We find that Nyanzachoerus was replaced by its abrasive-diet-specialized successor Notochoerus, possibly {{in response to a}} rapid decrease in forest cover. Notochoerus adapted at first to the expanding wood- and grasslands, and then to more arid shrublands. After a period of severe aridity around 2. 7 - 2. 5 Ma, more variable environments allowed Kolpochoerus and Metridiochoerus to disperse, while Notochoerus disappeared, perhaps having lost its competitive edge. Further changes in the environment encouraged the expansion of grasslands over shrublands, favouring Metridiochoerus. Kolpochoerus persisted in the more closed environments near water sources...|$|R
40|$|Roads are a vital {{component}} of civilization. They provide access {{for people to}} study, enjoy, and commune with forested wildlands and to extract an array of resources from natural and modified ecosystems. Roads have well-documented, short- and long-term effects on the environment that have become highly controversial, because of the value society now places on unroaded wildlands and because of wilderness conflicts with resource extraction. The approach taken in this report is to identify known and hypothesized road-related issues and to summarize the scientific information available about them. The report identifies links among processes and effects that suggest both potential compatible uses and potential problems and risks. Generalizations are made where appropriate, but roads issues and road science usually cannot be effectively separated from the specific ecologic, economic, social, and public lands management contexts in which roads exist or are proposed. Across a forest or river basin, the access needs, economic dependencies, landscape sensitivities, downstream beneficial uses of water, and so on can be reasonably well defined, but these relations tend to differ greatly from place to place. An effective synthesis of road issues draws local experts together to thoroughly evaluate road and access benefits, problems and risks, and to inform managers about what roads may be needed, for how long, for what purposes, and at what benefits and costs to the agency and society. Road effects and uses may be somewhat arbitrarily divided into beneficial and detrimental. The largest group of beneficial variables relates to access. We identified access-related benefits as harvest of timber and <b>special</b> forest products, <b>grazing,</b> mining, recreation, fire control, land management, res [...] ...|$|R
3000|$|However, {{this changed}} during the 1890 s {{colonization}} of Africa. During the almost seven decades (1890 - 1963) of British rule in Kenya, the colonial government introduced socio-economic and political policies {{to facilitate the}} integration of Kenyan societies into the colonial economy. For pastoral societies in northern Kenya, British authorities challenged the legitimacy of pastoral institutions through state-imposed policies of compulsory destocking, <b>grazing</b> controls and <b>restriction</b> of movements. This process gradually led to the integration of pastoralists into the colonial economy. The study seeks to understand the process that brought the Borana into the colonial economy, {{the impact of the}} integration on the pastoral economy and, specifically, the impact on Borana women’s roles and status. As will be shown later, in Borana society, we cannot speak of total equality of women and men, but the roles played by different genders were based on age, gender relationship and ones’ social status. The Borana women, like other pastoral women, discharged their roles based on the principles outlined above. They also participated in women’s-only traditional organization with women’s roles and rights within the society. However, Borana women’s lost status deteriorated during the 1890 s colonization as was true with women in other societies. While it cannot be argued that colonization was the only factor in the loss of women’s roles, I argue that it was the interplay of factors, among them, colonialism, in conjunction with the spread of Islam and Christianity, which added to the forces that reduced Borana women’s roles, positions and status in their society. The history of Christianity in northern Kenya has been explored by Tablino 2004, {{but it is important to}} note that unlike other parts of the colony, in northern Kenya, Christianity did not establish a significant presence until the final decades of colonial rule. Although missionary presence dates back to the early twentieth century, Christianity started taking root in northern Kenya only in the 1950 s and 1960 s. 2 It is to be understood that Christianity reached Africa generally in the context of the European’s moral duty to change the traditional religious practices and beliefs of Africans. While both men and women were affected, it fell largely on women who dominated religious and ritual practices as a venue to assert their roles. However, Borana women's status deteriorated following colonization beginning in the 1890 s, as was true for other societies (Kuwee Kumsa 2004). 3 [...]...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} grazing and indoor {{experiments}} were conducted at Massey University Deer Research Unit and Nutrition Laboratory, Palmerston North, New Zealand, {{to study the}} effects of grazing chicory (Cichorium intybus) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) /white clover (Trifolium repens) upon the growth, voluntary feed intake (VFI) and venison production of red and hybrid deer, and to study rumen digestion in deer fed either diet, to define factors responsible for the difference in feeding value (FV) between the two forages. Half of the animals in each experiment (Chpater 2) were grazed on either chicory or perennial ryegrass using a rotational grazing system, whilst for the indoor experiments (Chapter 3 & 4), rumen fistulated red deer individually kept in metabolism crates were fed fresh chicory or perennial ryegrass using automatic feeders at hourly intervals. In the last grazing Experiment (Chapter 5), to investigate the effect of condensed tannin (CT) in chicory and perennial ryegrass upon protein degradation, half of the animals were supplemented with polyethylene glycol (PEG; MW 3350) to inactivate CT and effects of CT were defined by comparing unsupplemented deer (CT acting) with PEG supplemented deer (CT inactivated). 1. The effects of grazing chicory or perennial ryegrass/white clover pasture upon growth and VFI of red and hybrid calves were compared both during lactation in summer of 1993 (Experiment 1; Chapter 1) and during post-weaning growth in autumn, winter and spring of 1993 (Experiment 2; Chapter 2). Relative to pasture, chicory had a higher ratio of readily fermentable:structural carbohydrate in all seasons and had higher organic matter digestibility (OMD) in summer and autumn but not in spring. Deer grazing chicory had higher VFI, bite weight, liveweight gain (LWG), and greatly reduced ruminating time than deer grazing pasture. Carcass dressing percentage and carcass weight of deer grazing chicory were higher than those grazing pasture. Hybrid deer grew better than red deer and there were forage x genotype interactions in Experiment 2, with LWG and carcass weight of hybrid deer (especially stags) being much greater when grazed on chicory. Carcass weight for red deer and hybrid stags was 64. 9 and 73. 0 kg when grazed on chicory and 56. 6 and 57. 0 kg when grazed on pasture. Grazing chicory advanced the date of first cut velvet antler by 28 days and increased the weight of total harvestable (first cut+regrowth) velvet antler. It was concluded that grazing chicory increased carcass weight, especially in hybrid stags with increased growth potential, and increased velvet antler production. This was achieved by increased VFI in all seasons and increased OMD of chicory in summer and autumn relative to deer grazing pasture. 2. Intra-ruminal particle size reduction in rumen fistulated castrate red deer (Cervus elaphus) fed fresh chicory was compared with that in deer fed fresh perennial ryegrass in a two-period each of 12 days indoor experiment, with each period being 15 days long. Measurements included the efficiency of particle breakdown during the time allowed for rumination () to below the critical size required to leave the rumen (passage through a 1 mm sieve) and jaw activities (ie. eating and ruminating). Total eating time and the number of eating bouts were similar for deer fed each forage, but deer fed chicory had a greater chewing rate during eating (97. 4 v. 81. 0 chews/min), and a higher number of chews/g DM eaten (36. 2 v. 31. 5). Deer fed chicory had lower total ruminating time (30 v. 257 min/ 22. 5 h), lower number of boli ruminated (38 v. 440 / 22. 5 h), lower number of rumination bouts (5. 4 v. l 6. 2 / 22. 5 h) and less chews per minute ruminating (16. 5 v. 44. 3) than those fed perennial ryegrass. Of the ten deer used to measure (), only four ruminated when fed chicory compared with nine when fed perennial ryegrass. Deer fed chicory had a higher efficiency of particle breakdown ((; 0. 64 v. 0. 42), higher fractional degradation of particles > 1 mm to < 1 mm (9. 2 v. 5. 1 %/h) and faster fractional disappearance of total DM from the rumen (10. 2 v. 5. 3 %/h). All three measurements for chicory were similar in deer that did or did not ruminate, but with perennial ryegrass all values were considerably reduced in the deer that did not ruminate. It was concluded that chicory can be broken down faster in the rumen, with less rumination being required than perennial ryegrass, and that some deer (60 %) could break down swallowed chicory to below the critical particle size without ruminating at all. The faster clearance of DM from the rumen explains the high VFI of deer grazing chicory. 3. The effects of feeding chicory and perennial ryegrass indoors on apparent digestibility, rumen fractional disappearance rate (FDPR), rumen fractional degradation rate (FDR), rumen fractional outflow rate (FOR) and mean retention time (MRT; 1 /FOR) were measured in deer fed at hourly intervals. The ratio of readily fermentable carbohydrate to structural carbohydrate was c. three times higher in chicory than in perennial ryegrass. Apparent digestibility of DM was higher in deer fed chicory than in deer fed perennial ryegrass (0. 785 v. 0. 727), whilst apparent digestibility of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) was lower in deer fed chicory (0. 679 v. 0. 755), due only to reduced hemicellulose digestibility (0. 667 v. 0. 783). Relative to deer fed perennial ryegrass, those fed chicory had higher rumen FDPR values for DM (14. 5 v. 8. 6 %/h), soluble carbohydrate (69. 9 v. 54. 7 %/h), cellulose (15. 5 v. 9. 8 %/h) and lignin (6. 8 v. 3. 8 %/h). Rumen FDR in deer fed chicory was higher than those fed perennial ryegrass for cellulose (11. 4 v. 7. 0 %/h) and lignin (2. 7 v. 1. 0 %/h), but tended to be lower for hemicellulose. Rumen FOR was higher and MRT was lower for both liquid and particulate matter in deer fed chicory compared to deer fed perennial ryegrass. It was concluded that rumen FDPR and apparent digestibility were much higher in deer fed chicory than in deer fed perennial ryegrass, due to faster degradation rates of most constituents in the rumen and faster outflow rates from the rumen. An exception was hemicellulose, where reduced rumen degradation rates and shorter rumen particulate MRT contributed to reduced apparent digestibility. Faster clearance from the rumen, due to both faster degradation and outflow rates may be used to explain the greater VFI, as well as faster growth rate in deer grazing chicory compared to those grazing perennial ryegrass. Faster rates of lignin solubility (as in the rumen (as measured by FDR) probably contributed to the more rapid breakdown of chicory in the rumen. 4. A laboratory and a grazing experiment were conducted to {{study the effects of}} CT in chicory and perennial ryegrass upon protein solubility and protein degradation. Nitrogen (N) solubility was measured in vitro in mineral buffer, using freeze dried samples of forages cut at the vegetative stage. Rumen ammonia concentration in rumen fistulated castrate red deer stags grazing either on perennial ryegrass or chicory was used as an index of protein degradation. Samples of rumen fluid were taken every 4 h for 24 h for ammonia concentration and pH. In both experiments, the effects of CT were deduced from responses to supplementation with PEG which binds and activates CT. PEG was given three times daily (total 20 g/day) in the grazing experiment. Small concentrations of CT were measured in both forages (0. 3 - 2. 5 g/kg DM), with chicory containing slightly higher total CT concentration than perennial ryegrass. Protein solubility was lower for chicory than for perennial ryegrass but was not affected by PEG addition for either forage. Rumen ammonia concentration was consistently higher for PEG-supplemented than for unsupplemented deer grazing each forage, suggesting that the low CT concentration in both forages was slowing protein degradation to ammonia without affecting protein solubility. Rumen pH tended to be slightly higher in PEG supplemented animals than in unsupplemented animals grazing either forage and mean rumen pH over all sampling times was much lower for deer grazing chicory, either with (5. 81 v. 6. 62) or without PEG supplementation (5. 63 v. 6. 44). It was concluded that action of CT contained in perennial ryegrass and chicory reduced protein breakdown in the rumen of deer grazing both forages, and that the low rumen pH found in deer grazing chicory may explain the low fibre digestibility of this forage. 5. Overall it was concluded that chicory was of very high FV and had excellent nutritional attributes for increasing deer production. However, its adoption as a forage by the NZ deer industry is likely to depend upon agronomic aspects, in particular devising grazing systems and breeding new chicory cultivars that have increased persistency and less tendency to go into a lignified reproductive state during summer. Chicory should be either sown alone or in a mixture with a legume such as white clover and should not be grazed in winter. Chicory should not be grazed using accepted practices for perennial ryegrass/white clover pastures (ie including a grass component and grazing it in winter); rather <b>special</b> <b>grazing</b> systems as used in this thesis should be used to prolong the life of chicory stands to 5 or 6 years...|$|R
