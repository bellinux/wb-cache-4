50|$|Domestic <b>showers</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} stall <b>showers</b> or <b>showers</b> over a bathtub. A stall <b>shower</b> is a dedicated <b>shower</b> area {{which uses a}} door or curtain to contain water spray. The <b>shower</b> over a bathtub saves bathroom space and enables the area {{to be used for}} either a bath or a <b>shower</b> and commonly uses a sliding <b>shower</b> curtain to contain the water spray. <b>Showers</b> may also be in a wet room, {{in which there is no}} contained <b>shower</b> area, or in a dedicated <b>shower</b> room, which does not require containment of water spray. Most domestic <b>showers</b> have a single overhead <b>shower</b> head, which may be adjustable.|$|R

5|$|On May 24, {{the strikers}} seized the Strong mine on Battle Mountain, which {{overlooked}} {{the town of}} Victor. The next day, at about 9am, 125 deputies arrived in Altman and set up camp {{at the base of}} Bull Hill. As they started to march toward the strikers' camp, miners at the Strong mine blew up the shafthouse, hurling the structure more than 300 feet into the air. A few moments later, the steam boiler was also dynamited, <b>showering</b> the deputies with timber, iron and cable. The deputies fled to the rail station and left town.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his father in 1894, Riley began regretting his choice not to marry or have children. To {{compensate}} for the lack of his own children, he became a doting uncle, <b>showering</b> gifts on his nieces and nephews. He had repurchased his childhood home in 1893 and allowed his divorced sister, Mary, his widowed sister-in-law, Julia, and their daughters to live in the home. He provided for all their needs and spent the summer months of 1893 living with them. He took his nephew Edmund Eital as a personal secretary and gave him a $50,000 wedding gift in 1912. Riley was well loved by his family.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} December attack, Timothy Bloodworth was at anchor in Antwerp {{later in the}} month {{awaiting}} a New York-bound convoy. At about 14:10 on 24 December, a German V-2 rocket exploded overhead, <b>showering</b> the ship with shrapnel. A short time later, a second rocket hit nearby and more fragments pelted the ship, this time damaging the starboard {{side of the ship}} at the number one cargo hold. Although Timothy Bloodworth had a total of 68 people aboard—8 officers, 33 crewmen, 26 Armed Guard, and 1 passenger—no one was injured in either attack. Authors Benjamin King and Timothy J. Kutta, in their book Impact: The History of Germany's V-Weapons in World War II, report that Timothy Bloodworth was the first ship to be hit by V-2 fragments during the war.|$|E
5|$|In the sonnet, {{the poet}} writes {{of why he}} has stopped <b>showering</b> his muse with flowery praise and adoration. In his {{analysis}} of Shakespeare's Sonnets, David West suggests that the sequence of sonnets 100-103 and the silence described are {{a response to the}} infidelity of the Fair Youth in the Rival Poet sequence of sonnets (78-86), which has caused a rift between the poet and his Muse. He writes of how immediately following the Rival Poet sonnets, the Poet begins to speak of his lover being false and having forsaken him. West claims that this ultimately culminates in sonnets 100-103, where the Poet expresses his regret over what has transpired.|$|E

5|$|The {{town centre}} was {{extensively}} remodelled in the 1970s, a scheme {{financed by the}} <b>Showering</b> family who owned the town's cider manufactories. The scheme included a new library (in a faithful copy of a former inn, The Bunch of Grapes, which had been demolished), and a new entertainment complex called The Centre, entirely in concrete, {{on the eastern side}} of the market square. When the allegedly Roman Chi Rho amulet was found in the Fosse Lane excavations in the 1990s, the complex was renamed The Amulet in honour of the find. It has recently been renamed again as The Academy.|$|E

The music video begins with Carey sitting alone in a limousine, recalling a night she shared some time previous. As scenes of Carey reminiscing in the limo are shown, clips of her dressing in an old apartment are presented. Eventually, Carey joins a roof-top party one night, where she begins dancing and caressing her lover. As the passion between them grown, rain begins to fall, <b>showering</b> everyone atop the edifice. As these scenes end, Carey in the present opens the sun-roof of the limo and stands into the rainy night, trying to recapture those magical moments she shared on that rainy roof-top encounter. The video ends with a wet Carey lying {{in the back of the}} limousine, sad and lonely.|$|E
5|$|A prince {{noted for}} the {{permissiveness}} {{of his private}} life, Louis I's prodigality was notorious. While visiting England in 1677 he incurred the ire of King Charles II by <b>showering</b> expensive gifts on Hortense Mancini, the king's mistress. The English and Prince Louis later became political enemies when Louis {{took part in the}} Anglo-Dutch Wars against England, leading his own Monaco Cavalry into battles in Flanders and Franche-Comté. These acts earned Louis the gratitude of Louis XIV who made him ambassador to the Holy See, charged with securing the Spanish Succession. However, the cost of upholding his position at the papal court caused him to sell most of his grandfather Honoré II's art collection, denuding the palace he had earlier so spectacularly enhanced. Louis died before securing the Spanish throne for France, an act which would have earned the Grimaldi huge rewards. Instead Europe was immediately plunged into turmoil as the War of the Spanish Succession began.|$|E

5|$|Driving on, Marion {{stops for}} {{the night at the}} Bates Motel. The proprietor, Norman Bates, invites her to a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts, but then hears an {{argument}} between Norman and his mother about bringing a woman into her house. They eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have a life outside of her. Her sense of compassion and responsibility awakened by Norman's story, Marion decides to go back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money, and prepares for bed. As she is <b>showering,</b> a shadowy figure comes in and stabs her to death with a chef's knife. Norman discovers the murder and assumes his mother is responsible. He meticulously cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions—including the embezzled money—into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.|$|E
5|$|They {{argued that}} Bamber had then set about {{arranging}} {{the scene to}} make it appear that Sheila was the killer. He discovered that she could not have reached the trigger with the silencer attached, so he removed it and returned it to the gun cupboard, then placed a Bible next to her body to introduce a religious theme. He removed the kitchen phone from its hook, left the house via a kitchen window, perhaps after <b>showering,</b> and banged the window from the outside so that the catch dropped back into position. He had then cycled on his mother's bicycle. Shortly after 3am, he had telephoned Mugford, then the police at 3:26am to say he had just received a frantic call from his father. To create a delay before the bodies were discovered, he had not called 999, had driven slowly to the farmhouse, and had told police that his sister was familiar with guns, so that they would be reluctant to enter.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} {{unresolved}} {{questions concerning the}} definition of work: in particular, whether unpaid endeavors, such as volunteering or studying, are work. Non-work time should not be equated with free time, as it comprises not only free time, dedicated to leisure, but also time dedicated to certain obligatory activities, such as housework. Dividing activities into free and dedicated time is not easy. For example, brushing one's teeth is neither work nor leisure; scholars differ in their classifications of activities such as eating a meal, shopping, repairing a car, attending a religious ceremony, or <b>showering</b> (various individuals {{may or may not}} classify such activities as leisure). The relation between work and leisure can also be unclear: research indicates that some individuals find skills that they have acquired at work useful to their hobbies (and vice versa), and some individuals have used leisure activities to advance their work careers. Sociologists also disagree as to whether political or spiritual activities should be included in studies of leisure. Further, among some occupational communities, such as police officers or miners, it is common for work colleagues to be off-time friends and to share similar, work-based leisure activities.|$|E

There are also <b>shower</b> doors that are in a neo angle design for use on <b>shower</b> pans that have the neo design as well. The design of the <b>shower</b> pan is extremely important as the <b>shower</b> door must be the type required for the pan in order to work.

30|$|Generally, {{there are}} two types of <b>shower</b> events; (1) occur in {{separate}} <b>shower</b> stalls, and (2) occur in shower/bathtub combinations. Each type of <b>shower</b> event produces a distinct pattern. A <b>shower</b> event from a shower/bath tub combo typically begins with a high flow rate. Then, the diverter valve is tripped and the flow is throttled down to a much lower rate for the duration of the <b>shower.</b> A standard <b>shower</b> stall event does not exhibit the high flow rate at the beginning or end of the <b>shower</b> event; also, it tended to have a relatively consistent flow rate throughout the duration of the <b>shower</b> event. Volume and the most frequent flow rate (mode) property are two critical features for identifying a <b>shower</b> event.|$|R
