500|$|Tenebrae had a wide {{theatrical}} release throughout Italy and mainland Europe, {{something the}} director very much needed after having suffered major distribution {{problems with his}} previous film, Inferno.

In Italy, Tenebrae had been released with a VM18 rating, meaning it could not be seen legally by persons under the age of eighteen. Argento had desired a VM14 rating, both to attract a younger audience and to increase the film's chances of commercial success. Tenebrae features scenes of female homosexuality; attitudes towards homosexuality in Italy were fairly conservative at the time, and Argento said he wanted to [...] "recount this subject freely and in an open manner, without interference or being ashamed". The VM18 rating upset him, as he believed it was a result of the <b>sexual</b> <b>diversity</b> on display rather than the film's violence.|$|E

40|$|Using {{interview}} data on LGBT young peoples’ policing experiences, I argue policing practices work to constrain public visibilities of <b>sexual</b> and gender <b>diversity</b> in public spaces. Police actions recounted by LGBT young people suggest {{the workings of}} a certain kind of visuality (Mason, 2002) and evidenced more subtle actions that sought to constrain, regulate, and punish public visibilities of <b>sexual</b> and gender <b>diversity.</b> Aligning with the work of sexualities academics and theorists, this paper suggests that, like violence is itself a bodily spectacle from which onlookers come to know things, policing works to subtly constrain public visibilities of “queerness”. Policing interactions with LGBT young people serves the purpose of visibly yet unverifiably (Mason, 2002) regulating displays of <b>sexual</b> and gender <b>diversity</b> in public spaces. The paper concludes noting how police actions are nonetheless visible and therefore make knowable to the public the importance of keeping same sex intimacy invisible in public spaces...|$|R

40|$|Since the mid 1980 s the American, {{like the}} New Zealand {{workplace}} has undergone significant changes, {{particularly in the}} composition of the workforce. Increasingly, the 'traditional' employee, a white male, ablebodied heterosexual is in the minority. The emergence of Diversity Programmes within the American workplace is a direct response to these changes. While Diversity Programmes emerged from Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) and Affirmative Action Programmes, the distinctions are significant. Diversity Programmes focus on productivity, profitability, inclusivity and organisational culture. In recent years a major area of growth has been the development of <b>sexual</b> orientation <b>Diversity</b> Programmes. This research examines ten American organisations that have invested significant resources into <b>sexual</b> orientation <b>Diversity</b> Programmes with reported success, describes their key features and the reasons for this success. The findings clearly reflect the literature on the subject and show that when an organisation values and respects its gay, lesbian and bisexual employees the rewards to the company can be significant, both to the individual and the organisation. The second component of the research was the examination of the response of New Zealand organisations to the implementation of <b>sexual</b> orientation <b>Diversity</b> Programmes. However, it became evident that this could not proceed as planned, primarily due to local lack of awareness of the concept of Diversity Programmes and the apparent lack of interest in addressing the issue of sexual orientation in the workplace. The local research then reviewed local human resource related policies and procedures, to determine the level of inclusivity of gay and lesbian employees, and found that of the 20 organisations sampled, while all subscribe to EEO, most exclude sexual orientation, and in many cases their policies and procedures are discriminatory against gay and lesbian employees. The research highlighted significant differences between the American and the New Zealand organisations sampled. While American companies have embraced <b>sexual</b> orientation <b>Diversity</b> Programmes as being good for business, the local organisations remain focused on legislative requirements and moral obligation, a key criticism of EEO programmes in the literature. While the American workplace has demonstrated an ability to respond successfully to the changing nature and composition of the workplace, New Zealand organisations have been slow to adapt, with the result that gay and lesbian employees do not, in many cases, have equity within the workplace and organisations are not realising their potential level of profit and profitability...|$|R

This is reflected in a growing number of ethnographies and anthropological analyses that provide a new understanding of <b>sexual</b> and gender <b>diversity</b> that goes beyond clinical and biomedical interpretations.

The aim of this work is to contribute to the construction of the history of anthropology of <b>sexual</b> and gender <b>diversity</b> in Spain from a situated perspective. This article demonstrates that despite the indisputable international influence on the development of this specialty in Spain, there have also been specific local developments heavily influenced by the socio-historical context and feminist anthropology in the country...|$|R
