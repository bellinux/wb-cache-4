40|$|Conventional joining {{techniques}} like {{press fitting}} or crimping require {{the application of}} mechanical forces to the parts which, {{in combination with the}} tolerances of both parts to be joined, lead to imprecision and poor tensile strength. In contrast, laser beam micro welding provides consistent joining and high flexibility and it acts as an alternative as long as press fitting, crimping, screwing or gluing are not capable of batch production. Different parts and even different metals can be joined in a non-contact process at feed rates of up to 60 m/min and with weld <b>seam</b> <b>lengths</b> from 0. 6 mm to 15. 7 mm.

This results in low distortion of the joined watch components.

30|$|Considering the {{above-mentioned}} results {{in conjunction with}} the total cost of the separator, it was decided to opt for Case 3 as the best configuration. It should be mentioned that the smaller the diameter, the less the vessel will weigh and therefore the lower it cost (Stewart and Arnold 2008; Mulyandasari 2011). A high condensate–water separation performance along with a low water content at the condensate outlet was predicted for this case. In addition, the high condensate percentage at the gas outlet in this case could have been decreased by using a suitable mist extractor. It should also emphasize that vessel number three can effectively handle increasing the gas and water flow rates. The dimensions of this vessel were compared with the length and diameter of the existing three-phase separator of NIOC, which was a three-phase horizontal separator with a seam to <b>seam</b> <b>length</b> of 5000  mm and a diameter of 1850  mm.

40|$|AbstractPresshardened {{steel is}} used in {{nowadays}} automotive production. Due to its high strength, sheet thicknesses can be reduced which results in decreasing weight of car body components. However, because of microstructure softening and coating agglomerations in the seam, welding is still a challenge. In this paper laser beam welding of 22 MnB 5 with varying energy input per irradiated area is presented. It is found that increasing energy input per <b>seam</b> <b>length</b> reduces tensile strength. Using a small spot size of 200 μm, tensile strength of 1434 N/mm 2 can be reached in bead on plate welds. In lap welds tensile strength is limited because of coating particles agglomerating at the melt pool border line. However, the resulting strength is higher when using several small weld seams than using one seam with the same total seam width. With three weld seams, each 0. 5 mm in width, tensile strength of 911 N/mm 2 is reached in lap welding...|$|E

The results obtained from this vessel were reviewed in a CFD evaluation. The overall arrangement of this separator (Case 7) is shown in Fig.  1 b.

Test variables include openings in the sheeting, recessing of purlins in from the sheet ends, <b>seams</b> in the <b>length</b> of the sheet and placing the purlins flat;An analytical method and an empirical equation to be used in conjunction with testing are presented. The analytical method predicts the stiffness of the control diaphragms within 1. 5 % of that predicted by the plane truss computer analog. The empirical equation was fitted to steel diaphragms on steel frames and can be used to adjust for different diaphragm lengths, purlin spacings, and sheet thicknesses;It was found that the location and size of an opening does influence diaphragm stiffness. Openings with sheeting on two sides only will reduce diaphragm stiffness approximately twice as much as openings with sheeting on three or four sides. Fastener stiffness and location have the largest impact on diaphragm stiffness. Increasing the number of fasteners at <b>seams</b> in the <b>length</b> of the diaphragm will off-set the effect of the discontinuous sheet length.

40|$|For Magnetic Pulse Welding (MPW), Lorentz {{forces are}} {{utilized}} for the rapid acceleration and controlled high velocity collision of two metallic parts. Due {{to the absence}} of external heat, solid state weld seams can be produced without the formation of critical intermetallic phases. In order to adjust the process parameters for a sound weld, optical measuring techniques are preferred, since they are not influenced by the strong magnetic fields of the working coils. Unfortunately, existing technologies are either expensive, difficult to evaluate, or limited in their accessibility to the interesting areas. To overcome these drawbacks, a new method was applied taking advantage of the hypervelocity impact (HVI) flash that is characteristic for the process. Experiments were performed using phototransistors for the detection of the HVI flash and the established photonic Doppler velocimetry in parallel. The flash characteristic was found to be a reliable measure for the evaluation of the local impact time as well as the weld <b>seam</b> <b>length.</b> It has a great potential for both process development and monitoring.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Modern tennis has been played for over a hundred years, but despite significant improvements {{in the design and}} manufacture of tennis balls to produce a long-lasting and consistent product, the design of a tennis ball has barely changed in the last century. While some work has been done to better understand the dynamic behaviour of a tennis ball, no structured analysis has been reported assessing how the typical constructions of the inner rubber core and cloth panels affect its behaviour and performance. This research describes the development of an advanced and validated finite element (FE) tennis ball model which illustrates the effects of the viscoelastic and anisotropic materials of a tennis ball on ball deformation and bounce during impacts with the ground and the racket,representative of real play conditions. The non-linear strain rate properties exhibited by the materials of a tennis ball during high velocity impacts were characterised using a series of experiments including tensile and compressive tests as well as low and high velocity impact tests. The impacts were recorded using a high speed video (HSV) camera to determine deformation, impact time, coefficient of restitution (COR) and spin rate. The ball material properties were tuned to match the HSV results, and the ball s model parameters were in good agreement with experimental data for both normal and oblique impacts at velocities up to 50 m/s and 35 m/s, respectively. A time sequenced comparison of HSV ball motion and FE model confirmed the accuracy of the model, and showed significant improvement on previous models. Although the existing construction of tennis ball cores was found to provide a sufficiently uniform internal structure to base competition standard tennis balls, the anisotropic nature of the cloth panels resulted in deviation angles as high as 1. 5 degrees in ball bounce. Therefore, new cloth panel configurations were modelled which allowed the cloth fibre orientations around the ball to be adjusted resulting in better bounce consistency. The effect of cloth <b>seam</b> <b>length</b> on ball flight was explored through wind tunnel tests performed on solid balls made by additive manufacturing (AM) and on actual pressurised tennis ball prototypes. A reverse Magnus effect was observed on the AM balls, however, this phenomenon was overcome by the rough nature of the cloth cover on the real tennis ball prototypes. A ball trajectory simulation showed that there was no obvious dependence between <b>seam</b> <b>length</b> and shot length or ball velocity. Finally, a basic panel flattening method was used to determine the 2 Dsize of the cloth panel patterns corresponding to the new configurations, and tiling methods were designed to estimate cloth wastage. The traditional dumbbell design appeared to result in the minimum amount of waste. The work reported in this thesis represents a significant improvement in the modelling of tennis ball core, cloth and seams, as well as the ball s interaction with the ground and racket strings. While this research focused on woven cloth, needle cloth is also widely used in the manufacture of balls in the US. The modelling of needle cloth could therefore be part of a future study. Additionally, details such as the depth and roughness of the cloth seam could be included in the model to study their effect on spin generation. Also, including cloth anisotropy in the flattening method would allow a better prediction of cloth wastage which could then have an influence on the configuration of the cloth panels...|$|E

Typical protective garments {{are made of}} special non-stretchable fabric and hence can restrict {{the movement of the}} wearer if the garment is not designed properly. A protective garment that can ensure maximal range-of-motion can be a difference of life and death when the disciplinary force is on duty. There are many aspects of range-of-motion. In the current study, we address the question of the appropriate amount of dynamic ease allowance (movement ease) required for any given height that the arm is supposed to reach. The relationship among the dynamic ease allowance, under arm sleeve length, and side <b>seam</b> <b>length</b> was derived, by using the rod joint model of the human being and assuming the motion is a cross-sectional one along the frontal plane. Sixty subjects wore the special net garment to record the reference of zero dynamic ease allowance, and then the adjustable garments of different scye depth, which is related to the dynamic ease allowance. The subjects were asked to move their arm along a vertical plane, from rest position to the maximum height that they can reach. Such motions were recorded by a motion capturing system. The experimental data was compared to the theoretical prediction. Since the analysis was conducted using the 3 -D data and the garment measurements must be converted from the 3 -D environment (when the garment is worn) to the 2 -D environment (when the garment is not worn). The conversion approximation is also presented. Consequently, when the required posture is known, the required scye depth and the required dynamic seam allowance can be found.
