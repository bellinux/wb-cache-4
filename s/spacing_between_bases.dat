40|$|In the {{presence}} of ATP, recA protein forms a presynaptic complex with single-stranded DNA that is an obligatory intermediate in homologous pairing. Presynaptic complexes of recA protein and circular single strands that are active in forming joint molecules can be isolated by gel filtration. These isolated active complexes are nucleoprotein filaments with the following characteristics: (i) a contour length that is at least 1. 5 {{times that of the}} corresponding duplex DNA molecule, (ii) an ordered structure visualized by negative staining as a striated filament with a repeat distance of 9. 0 nm and a width of 9. 3 nm, (iii) approximately 8 molecules of recA protein and 20 nucleotide residues per striation. The widened <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> <b>bases</b> in the nucleoprotein filament means that the initial matching of complementary sequences must involve intertwining of the filament and duplex DNA, unwinding of the latter, or some combination of both to equalize the spacing between nascent base pairs. These experiments support the concept that recA protein first forms a filament with single-stranded DNA, which in turn binds to duplex DNA to mediate both homologous pairing and subsequent strand exchange...|$|E

5000|$|In {{order for}} an {{intercalator}} to fit <b>between</b> <b>base</b> pairs, the DNA must dynamically open a <b>space</b> <b>between</b> its <b>base</b> pairs by unwinding. The degree of unwinding {{varies depending on}} the intercalator; for example, ethidium cation (the ionic form of ethidium bromide found in aqueous solution) unwinds DNA by about 26°, whereas proflavine unwinds it by about 17°. This unwinding causes the base pairs to separate, or [...] "rise", creating an opening of about 0.34 nm (3.4 Å). This unwinding induces local structural changes to the DNA strand, such as lengthening of the DNA strand or twisting of the base pairs. These structural modifications can lead to functional changes, often to the inhibition of transcription and replication and DNA repair processes, which makes intercalators potent mutagens. For this reason, DNA intercalators are often carcinogenic, such as the exo (but not the endo) 8,9 epoxide of aflatoxin B1, acridines such as proflavine or quinacrine, or ethidium bromide.|$|R

Unlike the mechanism of urea-induced unfolding of proteins, which is well understood, the action of urea on RNA has barely been explored. We performed extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to determine the molecular underpinnings of urea-induced RNA denaturation. Urea displays its denaturing power in both secondary and tertiary motifs of the riboswitch structure. Our simulations reveal that the denaturation of RNA structures is mainly driven by the hydrogen-bonding and stacking interactions of urea with the bases. Through detailed studies of the simulation trajectories, we found that geminate pairs <b>between</b> urea and <b>bases</b> due to hydrogen bonds and stacks persist only ∼ 0. 1 − 1 ns, {{which suggests that the}} urea−base interaction is highly dynamic. Most importantly, the early stage of base-pair disruption is triggered by penetration of water molecules into the hydrophobic domain <b>between</b> the RNA <b>bases.</b> The infiltration of water into the narrow <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>base</b> pairs is critical in increasing the accessibility of urea to transiently disrupted bases, thus allowing urea to displace inter-base hydrogen bonds.

40|$|AbstractFeature {{selection}} for text categorization is a well-studied problem and its {{goal is to}} improve the effectiveness of categorization, or the efficiency of computation, or both. The system of text categorization based on traditional term-matching is used to represent the vector space model as a document; however, it needs a high dimensional space to represent the document, and {{does not take into account}} the semantic relationship between terms, which leads to a poor categorization accuracy. The latent semantic indexing method can overcome this problem by using statistically derived conceptual indices to replace the individual terms. With the purpose of improving the accuracy and efficiency of categorization, in this paper we propose a two-stage feature selection method. Firstly, we apply a novel feature selection method to reduce the dimension of terms; and then we construct a new semantic <b>space,</b> <b>between</b> terms, <b>based</b> on the latent semantic indexing method.

40|$|AbstractThe human diet {{contains}} a large variety of aromas, tastes and textures.

It has also been reported in recent literature that food texture was a main driver for satiation processes and thus it is of interest for the food manufacturing industry {{to be able to}} control textural properties of food within the limits of acceptability for the consumer. For solid foods, fracture force is an important aspect of texture and we were interested in understanding the physiological drivers of this variable. We present a third order lever model of human bite force and the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> teeth <b>based</b> on data from the literature on human oral anatomy. The results from the model are compared with experimental data available in the literature. The model compares well with the experimental data (r 2 = 0. 95, p= 0. 0010, MPE= 0. 18), and can thus be used to derive a diagram of how food properties such as piece size or fracture force can be used to define whether foods are close to the limits of what the human jaw is capable of breaking. Such modeling tools can be used to define texture rules for tailor-made nutrition for specific populations based on their mastication abilities. The limitations of this modeling approach are also discussed, particularly the fact that tooth shape should also be considered, as this will ultimately define fracture stress, which is the deterministic factor of food fracture...|$|R

On the other hand, {{we need to take}} into consideration more subjective, qualitative aspects such as building shapes and <b>space</b> <b>between</b> them <b>based</b> on bottom-up principle. In order to connect both principles, a new, performance-based parametric urban design method is proposed. It is based on a concept of parametric maps, which represent spatial distribution of key building parameters (quantitative criteria, top-down) throughout the area and are preliminary loaded into the virtual urban development area. Once parametric maps are loaded, we begin designing a development by placing the buildings (qualitative criteria, bottom-up), which adapt their parameters while changing their locations. Parametric maps thus represent a link between a set of spatial parameters and the actual shape of each building in a way, which connects both, top-down and bottom-up principles of urban design into a single conceptual framework. In order to evaluate this new method, an interactive prototype application has been developed in Maya (3 D modeling software) and the following results were obtained: 1.) a significant speedup is possible in the creation of different design alternatives in early stage of urban design process; 2.) use of parametric maps is most suitable for mid- to large-scale projects (+ 15 buildings), while they can be redundant for small-scale areas; 3.) possibility of inconsistency with site regulations is diminished...|$|R

The KNN however, used as system of voting to determine which class an unclassified object belongs to, considering the class of the nearest neighbors in the input space. The SVM is extremely fast, classifying images in roughly ten seconds as opposed to the KNN which takes anywhere from forty to fifty seconds to classify the same image. When classifying the KNN generally does a good job, however, it generates a lot of small misclassifications that interfere with final classified image that is outputted as opposed to the SVM that will occasionally misclassify a large object that rarely interferes with the final classified image. While both algorithms yield positive results regarding the accuracy in which they classify the images, the KNN appears to be slightly more accurate...|$|R
