5|$|The {{pollution}} {{issue is}} a main concern of citizens of Calhoun County, and has attracted demonstrations against industry in Point Comfort. However, Alcoa has worked with <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>officials,</b> spending $110million {{to reduce the size}} of the superfund site, as part of a 2005 settlement. Cooperation aims to create 70 additional acres of salt marsh and 11 acres of oyster reef habitat.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>officials</b> began closed-door {{negotiations}} {{about the}} possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as groundwater remediation. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E

5|$|On September 20, {{two days}} after Hurricane Isabel passed the state, Governor Ruth Ann Minner made a formal request for a federal {{disaster}} declaration for the state. Later that day, President George W. Bush issued a federal disaster declaration for Delaware, one of twelve disaster declarations for the state. The declaration allowed {{for the use of}} federal disaster funds and emergency resources to help families and businesses recover from the effects of Hurricane Isabel. <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>officials</b> opened a disaster recovery center in Georgetown and Wilmington to assist individuals who suffered losses from Isabel and the remnants of Tropical Storm Henri just days before. 761people visited the recovery centers before they closed. One week after the disaster declaration, residents began receiving checks for those who applied for aid. By about two months after the passage of Hurricane Isabel, 659 residents applied for assistance, with slightly over $1million (2003USD, $1.1million 2006USD) being distributed to the victims. 141 loan applications were received, as well. FEMA distributed about $2.5million ($ USD) in Small Business Administration loans, and also received 183 public assistance loans for repair or replacement of public facilities.|$|E
5|$|The first {{segment of}} what later became I-94 within the state, the Willow Run Expressway, was built near Ypsilanti and Belleville in 1941, with an easterly {{extension}} to Detroit in 1945. This expressway was initially numbered M-112. In the mid-1950s, <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>officials</b> planned an Interstate {{to replace the}} original route of U.S. Highway12 (US12). By 1960, the length of I-94 was completed from Detroit to New Buffalo. Two years later, the US12 designation was dropped from the freeway. Subsequent extensions in the 1960s completed {{most of the rest}} of the route, including the remaining sections between Detroit and Port Huron which superseded the routing of US25. The last segment opened to the public in 1972 when Indiana completed its connection across the state line. Since completion, I-94 has remained relatively unchanged; a few interchanges have been rebuilt, a second span was constructed for the Blue Water Bridge, and in 1987, a plane crashed on the freeway during take off from the airport in Detroit. The routing of I-94 is notable for containing the first full freeway-to-freeway interchange in the United States, connecting to the Lodge Freeway (M-10), and for comprising the first complete border-to-border toll-free freeway in a state in the United States. The highway has one auxiliary route, I-194, which serves downtown Battle Creek, and eight business routes. Various segments have been dedicated to multiple people and places.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} of the Combahee River Raid was identified to <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>officials</b> by Jeff Grigg prior to a survey related to a bridge replacement project across the Combahee River on U.S. Highway 17.

25|$|Raising {{financial}} support for a new eight-lane bridge over the Cooper River was a struggle 20 years in the making, prolonged by the state's insistence {{that it could not}} afford such a bridge and by Charleston's reluctance to provide any funds for the project. Several proposals were made for a toll bridge, but the mayors of Charleston and Mount Pleasant objected. When officials revealed in 1995 that the Grace Bridge scored a 4 out of 100 for safety and integrity, retired U.S. Congressman Arthur Ravenel, Jr. ran for the South Carolina Senate with a goal of solving the funding problem. He helped to establish the S.C. Infrastructure Bank and worked with local, <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>officials</b> to create partnerships that helped to materialize the final funding.|$|E

25|$|On April 18, 1906, {{a devastating}} {{earthquake}} {{resulted from the}} rupture of over 270 miles of the San Andreas Fault, from San Juan Bautista to Eureka, centered immediately offshore of San Francisco. The quake is estimated by the USGS {{to have had a}} magnitude of 7.8 on the Richter scale. Water mains ruptured throughout San Francisco, and the fires that followed burned out of control for days, destroying approximately 80% of the city, including almost all of the downtown core. Many residents were trapped between the water on three sides and the approaching fire, and a mass evacuation across the Bay saved thousands. Refugee camps were also set up in Golden Gate Park, Ocean Beach, and other undeveloped sections of the city. The official death toll at the time was 478, although it was officially revised in 2005 to 3,000+. The initial low death toll was concocted by civic, <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>officials</b> who felt that reporting the actual numbers would hurt rebuilding and redevelopment efforts, as well as city and national morale. The death toll from this event had the highest number of deaths from a natural disaster in California history.|$|E

500|$|Because the city's {{economy had}} become diversified before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Lewisville was {{relatively}} well {{insulated from the}} Great Depression. Many residents, including business leaders, nevertheless supported the New Deal programs of Franklin D. Roosevelt. By 1936, the Works Progress Administration operated a cannery {{in the city to}} provide temporary jobs for unemployed residents. As an extension of the Good Roads Movement, which had been prominent in Denton County since the early 1910s, residents formed the Good Roads Committee of Lewisville to lobby <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>officials</b> for funding to create better streets. Lewisville celebrated the paving of the U.S. Route 77 between Denton and Dallas in 1931 with a [...] "Coming Out of the Mud" [...] ceremony.

500|$|The dam {{was almost}} built in 1914 by British capitalists but plans were halted due to World War I. In 1920, Holderman refused an offer given by Chicago {{businessmen}} and in 1929, the Wall Street Crash ended {{the hopes of}} Canadian engineers and investors building the dam for Holderman. In DC, supporters of the dam, which later included <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>officials,</b> argued for the dam {{as a source of}} hydroelectric power and that it could stimulate the state's economy but local energy providers opposed the possibility of a state-run electric utility. The onset of the Great Depression would revive and accelerate plans to construct the dam. Just prior in 1928, Oklahoma Representative Everette B. Howard secured $5,000 in funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to survey the Grand River. The results of the study concluded that it would cost over $6.2 million to construct a dam at the [...] "Pensacola site" [...] for flood control. The name [...] "Pensacola" [...] was derived from the only available means of identifying the site at the time: an old store on a Cherokee plantation. Because of limited state funding and a limited water supply on the Grand River, the project was not proposed at first for federal funding under the scope of hydroelectric power but instead for flood control.|$|E
