40|$|Objective. This was an {{exploratory}} analysis {{to develop a}} new way of representing BILAG- 2004 system scores longitudinally that would be clinically meaningful and easier to analyse in comparison with multiple categorical variables. Methods. Data from a multicentre longitudinal study of SLE patients (the BILAG- 2004 index and therapy collected at every visit) were used. External responsiveness analysis of the index suggested the possibility of using counts of <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> specified transitions in scores as a basis to analyse the system scores. Exploratory analyses with multinomial logistic regression were used to examine the appropriateness of this new method of analysing BILAG- 2004 system scores. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the performance of this approach. Results. There were 1414 observations from 347 patients. A novel method was devised based on counts of <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> defined transitions in score (BILAG- 2004 systems tally, BST). It has six components (<b>systems</b> <b>with</b> major deterioration, <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> minor deterioration, <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> persistent significant activity, <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> major improvement, <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> minor improvement and <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> persistent minimal or no activity). This was further simplified (simplified BST, sBST) into three components (<b>systems</b> <b>with</b> active/worsening disease, <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> improving disease and <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> persistent minimal or no activity). Both versions had expected associations with change in therapy. ROC curve analyses demonstrated that both versions had similar good performance characteristics (areas under the curve > 0. 80) in predicting increase in therapy. Conclusion. The BST and sBST provide alternative approaches to representing BILAG- 2004 disease activity longitudinally. Further validation of their use is required...|$|R

30|$|On another {{research}} frontier, {{adaptive control}} method [13] {{is an effective}} way to estimate the unknown parameters due to its advantages on witnessed rapid and impressive developments leading to global stability and tracking results for nonlinear systems. It has been successfully applied to synchronize chaotic <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> unknown parameters, and many important results have been presented. For example, Park studied adaptive synchronization of a unified chaotic <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> an unknown parameter [14, 15]. Zhang et al. proposed the adaptive controllers and adaptive laws to synchronize two different chaotic <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> unknown parameters [16]. In [17], the adaptive complete synchronization between chaotic <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> fully uncertain parameters were realized. Li et al. gave a deeply research on adaptive impulsive synchronization for fractional-order chaotic <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> unknown parameters [18]. In [19], adaptive synchronization of two different chaotic systems was addressed by considering the time varying unknown parameters. Adaptive added-order and reduced-order anti-synchronization of chaotic systems were investigated in [20, 21], respectively. He et al. made a thorough inquiry about synchronization of hyperchaotic <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> multiple unknown parameters [22]. Zhao et al. presented a discussion of chaos synchronization between the coupled <b>systems</b> on network <b>with</b> unknown parameters based on adaptive control method [23]. Liu developed adaptive anti-synchronization of chaotic complex nonlinear <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> unknown parameters [24]. Wu and Yang achieved the adaptive synchronization of coupled nonidentical chaotic <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> complex variables and stochastic perturbations [25]. However, all of these works only deal with the synchronization problems between two chaotic <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> unknown parameters. Up to now, no related results have been established for the synchronization of multiple chaotic <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> unknown parameters, which is another motivation of this paper.|$|R
