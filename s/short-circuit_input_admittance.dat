The contribution of the internal dynamics of the MMC on the <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> depends {{on the type of}} ac-side controllers implemented. For this reason, the <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> is first derived with the MMC operating in open-loop on the ac side. The results are then modified to include various acside controllers in order to analyze the impact of the internal dynamics of the MMC on the total <b>input</b> <b>admittance.</b> Based on the findings, recommendations are given on modeling the <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> of the MMC. Finally, the derived analytical models are verified using a detailed switching model of the MMC in the frequency domain...|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} Distributed Energy Resources (DER) penetration {{and increased}} High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) applications, Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) {{is becoming an}} integral part of the power system due to its advantages in terms of scalability, harmonic performance and efficiency. One of the most challenging topics as with regard to MMC lies in its modelling as the detailed model offers computational challenge during transient simulations. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to derive an <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> model that can be used for stability studies and controller designs. In this thesis, the topology and operating principles of MMC are studied and an <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> model is derived analytically. The derived <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> is then compared with the <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> of two level converter. Moreover, an average model of an MMC with four Sub Modules (SM) per arm is simulated in PLECS and used to validate the analytical model using frequency domain approach. Furthermore, the impact of different controller parameters, switching schemes and switching frequency variations on the derived <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> is investigated. It is found that the analytical and the simulated models agree very well for the entire frequency range with the exception of slight discrepancy at low frequency ranges (between 1 and 10 Hz). It is demonstrated that the <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> model remains the same regardless of the changes in modulation schemes. Moreover, the derived <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> is able to predict the changes in the <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> of MMC due to control parameter variations...|$|R
40|$|The <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> of a converter, {{connected}} to other dynamic subsystems, {{is a useful}} tool to investigate whether poorly damped oscillations or even unstable conditions might occur at certain frequencies. This is of interest in applications employing the modular multilevel converter (MMC), where the internal dynamics of the converter and the increased number of control loops greatly affect the MMC’s dynamic behaviour, compared to other types of converters. In this paper, the dc-side <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> of the direct-voltage controlled MMC is derived analytically and verified via small-signal perturbation in a detailed nonlinear time-domain simulation model.

This way the stabilization problem is reformulated as a loop-shaping problem, where the inverter <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> should be given desired properties. In order to shape the inverter <b>input</b> <b>admittance,</b> the torque producing current reference is modified by the DC-link voltage via a stabilization controller.

The IDT {{is intended to}} be used as the transducer of a surface acoustic wave (SAW) RFID tag. A piezoelectric substrate of 128 °YX-LiNbO 3 is used. Since <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> is a frequency-domain concept, it can be computed from acoustic and electric fields obtained from the FDTD simulation, only after they are transformed into the frequency domain. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm is used for this purpose. With the frequency-domain fields, the total power flux generated by the IDT and the voltage at its terminals can be computed.

40|$|In this paper, {{models of}} the <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> of RC {{interconnects}} are discussed in depth to understand and evaluate their loading effects on the driving CMOS gates. From the {{detailed analysis of the}} <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> pole-zero location, arguments are derived to prove that their <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> can be accurately approximated to that of a low-order equivalent RC circuit, in contrast to the case of timing analysis of RC wires. More specifically, 1 st- or 2 nd-order equivalent circuits are derived analytically via the moment matching approach, as opposite to previous analyses that rely on purely numerical approaches. Moreover, simple analytical rules to extend results to arbitrarily complex networks are derived, as opposite to the usual approach that requires the numerical estimation of moments. Being fully analytical, the proposed approach permits to develop models that are extremely simple (i. e., computationally efficient), as well as to gain an insight into the properties of the <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> of RC interconnects. The proposed equivalent circuits are evaluated and validated in situations that occur in real CAD design flows, where RC wire loading effects are estimated by CAD tools to perform the timing/power analysis of the buffer driving the wire. The analysis is validated through extensive simulations on a 65 -nm CMOS technology. Well-defined criteria are also derived to select the appropriate model of the RC wire <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> for accurate timing/power estimations in VLSI CAD tools...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – In a {{companion}} paper (Part I), we investigated stability of induction motor drives, with resonant input filters. By using a linearized feedback {{model of the}} drive, it was shown how stability specifications could be transformed into constraints on the <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> of the voltage source inverter. The stabilization problem then becomes a standard feedback control loop-shaping problem, where the Nyquist curve of the inverter <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> should satisfy certain constraints. In this paper (Part II), we design and analyze controllers to meet such specifications. This approach covers both field-oriented control as well as direct torque control. First, a general expression for the controllers {{in terms of the}} desired inverter <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> is derived. Then we propose an explicit stabilization controller, which is easy to implement, while still providing a good compromise between robustness, damping of the DC-link and acceptable torque control. The performance of the proposed stabilization controller is verified through experiments with a hardware-in-the-loop simulator. I...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{research}} of a trade-off between loudness and sustain (duration) {{is a major}} issue for piano designers and manufacturers. The way the energy of vibration is transferred from the piano string to the soundboard depends on the end conditions of the strings at the bridge: these conditions can be approximated by the <b>input</b> <b>admittance</b> at the connecting point between the string and the resonator. Therefore, proper measurements of this value are needed. Given this, we propose here a method of validation of admittance measurements on simple structures. Parameters such as frequencies and damping factors of the string partials depend directly on the end conditions. The analysis of the vibratory signal of the string, based on high resolution estimation methods (ESPRIT algorithm), allows us to evaluate efficiently those parameters and leads to the calculation of the <b>input</b> <b>admittance.</b> This method is implemented on a simplified device composed of a piano string coupled to a thin steel beam. The comparative study of two experimental cases (isolated string and string coupled) leads us to the <b>input</b> <b>admittance.</b> This value, deducted from vibratory measurements of the string is eventually compared to direct admittance measurements effected on the beam, in order to validate the method...|$|R
