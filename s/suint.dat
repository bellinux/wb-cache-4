50|$|Crude lanolin {{constitutes}} about 5-25%of {{the weight}} of freshly shorn wool. The wool from one Merino sheep will produce about 250-300ml of recoverable wool grease. Lanolin is extracted by washing the wool in hot water with a special wool scouring detergent to remove dirt, wool grease (crude lanolin), <b>suint</b> (sweat salts), and anything else stuck to the wool. The wool grease is continuously removed during this washing process by centrifuge separators, which concentrate it into a wax-like substance melting at approximately 38°C (100°F).|$|E
50|$|When {{the wool}} is {{obtained}} from fleeces, knitters remove the <b>suint</b> by leaving {{them out in}} the rain to soften and then pulling the wool out. Wool from any source must be washed in warm soapy water, rinsed a number of times, and hung on lines or spread out to dry. Yellowish wool is left in the sun to bleach. Washing is done primarily during the warm summer weather. Knitters hand-tease the dry wool to loosen and separate the matted or tangled fibres by pulling them apart. This allows the dirt, hay and twigs to fall out and makes the wool ready for carding.|$|E

In this work heritability, phenotypic and genetic correlations among wool colour and skin traits were examined. The genetic estimates were assessed by Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) procedures using average information algorithm (AIREML) in a Corriedale flock. The traits analysed were wool colour traits (CWC), yellow predictive colour (YPC), and Visual Score; <b>suint</b> traits such as <b>suint</b> percentage and potassium and sodium concentrations in <b>suint,</b> and physiological traits such as potassium and sodium concentrations in the skin, including plasma and red blood cells. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess phenotypic and genetic correlations between wool colour and skin traits, and to find the suitability of these traits as indirect selection criteria for clean wool colour. <b>Suint</b> traits were highly genetically correlated to YPC. <b>Suint</b> K, but not <b>suint</b> percentage, was found to have a high genetic correlation with CWC. Skin K, Visual Score, YPC and <b>suint</b> K were amongst the best indirect selection criteria for clean wool colour.

40|$|The {{association}} of fleece characters with susceptibility to dermatophilosis was studied in two flocks {{located on the}} south coast of Western Australia. The characters examined were wax content, <b>suint</b> content, wax to <b>suint</b> ratio, <b>suint</b> pH, yield, fleece wettability, fibre diameter, coefficient of fibre diameter variation, <b>suint</b> direct extract, direct extract pH and electrical conductivity. The results showed that wax to <b>suint</b> ratio was the only fleece character significantly (P < 0. 05) different in both flocks for sheep with dermatophilosis as compared to sheep without dermatophilosis (flock 1 : 2. 0 v 2. 7; flock 2 : 1. 4 v 1. 8).

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the final {{products from the}} current effluent treatment system for woolscouring (wool washing) plants, namely, (i) sludge produced from the chemical flocculation of solids in the wastewater from the wash bowls, and (ii) concentrated <b>suint</b> (sheep sweat) produced from evaporation of the liquid phase separated from the sludge. In addition, fibrous wastes from the woolscouring process were studied. The aims {{of the study were}} to (i) investigate whether <b>suint</b> could be applied in a sustainable way to arable land as a potassium fertiliser, and (ii) assess the conditions under which the sludge could be composted for use as a soil conditioner to return organic matter to soil. Experiments involving <b>suint</b> were performed at both laboratory and glasshouse scales, while experiments involving the solid woolscour wastes were based both in the laboratory and using a small-scale (4. 5 m 3 total capacity) in-vessel composting unit established at a New Zealand woolscour. Decomposition was measured using net-nitrogen mineralisation and weight loss methods. <b>Suint,</b> the water-soluble contaminants on the fleece, contained high levels of potassium (20 % on a dry weight basis) and also appreciable quantities of sulphur, sodium, and chlorine. Biological treatment before evaporation stabilised the resulting <b>suint</b> and improved the consistency of its composition. <b>Suint</b> did not affect the soil processes examined, in that it partly decomposed in soil, did not inhibit the turnover of model organic compounds, did not affect soil properties such as pH and electrical conductivity, and did not lead to increased leaching of mineral nitrogen. <b>Suint</b> was either neutral or positive towards plant performance when applied to soil at a rate of 100 kg potassium per hectare. <b>Suint</b> was therefore judged to be suitable for application to land and could be targeted to soils known to be deficient in potassium or to areas where crops with a high potassium demand are grown. Sludge, composed of dirt (soil particles, faecal matter, and skin and fibre debris) and wool grease, was highly variable in terms of its rate of decomposition, ranging from 0. 8 to 27. 8 % of the initial total nitrogen mineralised over 30 days at 37 ℃. Fibrous wastes, such as opener (fibre and contaminants removed from the wool by agitation prior to scouring) and scoured wool cleaner (wool fibre and dust removed from scoured and dried wool) wastes, also showed variability in decomposition rates. Sludge decomposition was improved by as much as threefold when co-incubated with fibrous wastes. Although it was shown that the polyacrylamide and pesticide content of sludge did not inhibit its decomposition, the effect of the grease content was not fully understood. Chemical properties of woolscour sludge, such as the carbon to nitrogen ratio, suggested that sludge was a substrate of good resource quality. From a biological perspective, however, the data suggested that woolscour sludge was limited in available nutrients; sludge nitrogen was derived principally from keratin, which decomposed at a low rate resulting in the slow release of mineral nitrogen and low levels of microbial activity. Thus, sludge appeared a poor substrate for composting. However, the results from composting trials indicated that the sludge could be successfully processed after blending with a bulking agent such as sawdust. The blended material showed a 90 % reduction in wool grease over 21 days of composting when the moisture content of the composting mass was kept optimal. Compost temperature exceeded 55 ℃ when wool fibre was added to the blend. Initial results from a case study involving the commercial composting of the entire sludge production (16 tonnes per day) from a New Zealand woolscour indicated that a saleable compost could be produced from a material that would otherwise go to landfill, and served to illustrate the commercial significance of these research results...|$|E

One day of wetting reduced the average thickness of the skin wax layer from 7. 82 to 4. 90 ¦m, {{but there was little}} change In the proportion of the skin surface covered by wax. When hyperaemia of the skin was first noted the proportion of the skin surface covered by wax had decreased from 97. 8 to 47. 5 % and the average thickness of skin wax had decreased to 3. 64 ¦m. Cholesterol content of the skin wax increased steadily from the first day of wetting as fleece rot developed, whereas lanosterol content increased only {{in the early stages of}} fleece rot. <b>Suint</b> content of the fleece, measured before wetting commenced, was positively correlated with fleece rot score at all times during wetting. <b>Suint</b> also showed significant correlations with moisture content of the proximal portion of the staple, percentage of the skin surface covered by wax and cholesterol and lanosterol content of the wax.

40|$|Heritabilities and {{phenotypic}} {{and genetic}} correlations for fleece traits were estimated from a data set comprising 805 {{male and female}} progeny of 44 sires of the Collinsville family group. Characteristics {{included in the study}} were greasy and clean fleece weight, yield, mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of fibre diameter, resistance to compression, scoured and greasy wool colour (expressed as yellowness, lightness and yellowness index), wax content, <b>suint</b> content, and subjectively assessed scores for greasy colour, character, handle, quality number, condition, staple formation, tip formation and density. Heritabilities of greasy and clean fleece weight, yield, mean fibre diameter and subjectively assessed fleece scores were in broad agreement with estimates from other Merino strains, but the genetic correlations of mean fibre diameter and associated characters (handle, quality number) with clean fleece weight were lower than previous estimates. Heritabilities for scoured yellowness of wool, resistance to compression and coefficient of variation of fibre diameter, which are potential additional measurements for the specification of wool in sale lots, were 0. 42 (¦. 0. 14), 0. 57 (¦ 0. 15) and 0. 47 (¦ 0. 15) respectively. Estimated heritabilities of wax and <b>suint</b> content were 0. 24 (¦ 0. 11) and 0. 44 (¦ 0. 14). Although the phenotypic correlations between measures of greasy wool colour and the corresponding measures of scoured wool colour were low (less than 0. 3), the genetic correlations were moderate to high (0. 4 - 0. 9). Thus selection on the basis of greasy wool colour should lead to genetic improvements in scoured colour.

40|$|Effluent {{from the}} wool {{scouring}} industry {{is considered to}} be the most strongly polluting waste in the whole textile industry (Anderson & Wood, 1973). It typically contains 3, 000 to 21, 000 mg/l wool grease, 7, 000 to 15, 000 mg/l <b>suint</b> salts (salt produced by natural excretions) and 10, 000 to 30, 000 mg/l dirt (sand, vegetable matter and fibre).

40|$|The {{effect of}} the two arsenical dips, viz. : Cooper's powder dip and sodium arsenite, on the fleece has been studied from several angles. The process of dipping, results in the {{leaching}} out of <b>suint</b> constituents, thereby influencing the hygroscopicity of the raw wool, especially at 100 per cent. humidity. The use of arsenicals as dips results in the contamination of the fleece with arsenic, some of this arsenic remaining in the fibres even after scouring. When using the correct concentrations, the dips themselves do not cause any noticeable damage to the fibre, except that Cooper's dip tends to stain the fleece yellow by depositing its insoluble constituents. Should, however, the alkalinity of the dips rise above pH 10 • 3, the soundness of the fibres may be seriously affected. Under normal conditions, however, the undesirable effect of dipping on the fibre soundness must be ascribed {{to the process of}} clipping as such, and not {{to the use of the}} chemicals here studied. In-vitro studies have shown that this dipping effect in turn is merely a secondary cause of damage, the initiative and primary cause of fibre damage being the {{effect of the}} ultra-violet radiations of ordinary sunlight. In this respect arsenates and arsenites would appear to protect the fibre, rather than causing further damage, since pure water is appreciably more deleterious to such radiated wools than arsenite solutions. Cooper's dip renders additional protection to the fibre, the yellow film staining the fibres impeding the penetration of the ultra-violet rays to the fibre itself. The theoretical implications of these observations have been discussed and explained. The natural grease and <b>suint</b> on the fibres were not found to afford sufficient protection against the effects of sunlight. In how far these observations affect the fleece on the sheep's back must still be further investigated. It may be expected, however, that repeated dipping would aggravate this photo-chemical effect, since the staple-formation is thereby destroyed, thus exposing a greater portion of the fleece to direct radiation.

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} into objectively measured attributes of commercial cashmere have differentiated cashmere produced in {{different regions of}} the world on the basis of cashmere fibre attributes. By plotting any two of mean fibre diameter, fibre curvature and resistance to compression, cashmere from different producing regions was segregated into distinct groupings. Australian cashmere had lower fibre curvature (P < 0. 05) probably as a consequence of being longer. Improved feeding of cashmere goats produced longer and slightly coarser cashmere but with significantly lower fibre curvature (P < 0. 05). The low resistance to compression of cashmere from new origins, mainly Australia, indicates that this cashmere is more compressible, ie is softer to handle, than cashmere from traditional sources. The composition of typical raw commercial Australian cashmere was determined as: guard hair 44. 3 %, cashmere 28. 5 %, moisture 17 %, <b>suint</b> 4. 2 %, grease 3. 0 %, soil 2 %, vegetable matter 0. 9 %, other impurities < 0. 1 %.

Merino wool from 3160 ewe and wether hogget’s over 3 years was used to estimate genetic parameters of dust and wool production traits. Dust penetration and dust index had a low genetic and phenotypic correlation (0. 23 and 0. 23 respectively).

Genetic correlations between yield and wax (- 0. 82), <b>suint</b> (- 0. 62) or dust index (- 0. 59) were negative, while the correlation between yield and dust penetration was positive (0. 36). It was concluded that dust penetration and dust content are genetically distinct, therefore, dust penetration should not be used {{as a measure of}} dust content. Breeders will make faster genetic gain in reducing dust content by selecting animals on the basis of higher yield rather than dust penetration.

40|$|Scouring is {{the first}} stage of wool {{processing}} and is essential for determining the quality of fiber. Traditional aqueous scouring is a method that emulsifies and removes contaminants (such as wool grease, <b>suint,</b> and dirt) from the fiber surface; however, it promotes wool felting and is energy and water intensive. This study has shown that modification of the traditional wool scouring line by introducing an ultrasonic device could be a viable alternative for the wool scouring industry. A standard six-bath wool scouring line was retrofitted with two ultrasonic panels working at 80 kHz in bath 2. Scouring was carried out in three modes: conventional mode without the transport rake, ultrasonic mode without the transport rake, and conventional mode with the transport rake. Fiber samples after scouring were measured for color index, residual grease content, and residual ash content. Ultrasonic scouring was found to improve removal of grease and ash from the wool fiber. Modifications were proposed for the design of an industrial scouring line including the addition of fiber transport and dunking rollers and number of baths for the installation. © The Author(s) 2014...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{benchtop}} scouring {{procedure was}} used to evaluate the ability of conventional detergent scouring systems to adequately clean fleece samples from a selection of Western Australian Merino wools. Sixteen fleeces were selected from the Western Australian Department of Agriculture resource flocks, covering a wide range in yield (49. 2 to 77. 5 %), wax (7. 3 to 26. 9 %), <b>suint</b> (4. 9 to 11. 6 %), and dust (1. 4 to 16. 3 %) contents. Using a simple detergent-based system, 50 % of the fleeces were classified as effectively scoured, based on residual wax content. When scouring liquor was not refreshed between subsamples drawn from the same fleece, wool wax, staple length and dust content in the greasy fleece accounted for 93 % of the variation in the rate of residual wax increase observed in sequential 10 g samples of wool. Residual ash content also increased but the greasy fleece parameters measured were not statistically significant predictors of residual ash changes. The rate of scoured wool colour change, when sequential samples of greasy wool from the same fleece were scoured without liquor change, could be predicted from greasy fleece yields. The scouring efficiency of the more difficult to scour wools was improved by the addition of sodium carbonate to the main scouring bowls...|$|E
40|$|As a {{continuation}} of the preliminary study of the colorimetric method as a rapid means of control of polysulphide solutions, the effect of free alkali on sodium polysulphide solutions at room temperature was studied, since in the process of dipping the washing-out of the <b>suint</b> of the fleece results in the interaction of clipwash with alkali and in the formation of alkali polysulphides. It was found that the chemical interaction, as revealed by ordinary chemical analysis, is slight, though the colorimetric study reveals a marked change in chemical nature. This change was ascribed, either to the formation of a complex compound between the alkali and the polysulphide, or to the existence of different isomers of the polysulphides in solution. The observation that field samples of lime-sulphur cannot be directly compared calorimetrically is thus partially explained. It was further shown that the addition of excess sodium carbonate and alcohol causes immediate precipitation of all turbidity-forming materials, rendering a perfectly clear solution of the alkali polysulphides which can be matched against a potassium dichromate standard. In this way fairly accurate values were obtained with both used and unused lime-sulphur clip washes. It is proposed to apply this colorimetric principle for evolving a simple field method of control.

This work aimed to quantify the factors which affect the whiteness and brightness of 36 batches of processed Australian white cashmere sourced from nine different farms. The cashmere was tested for tristimulus values brightness (Y) and whiteness, as measured by yellowness (Y-Z). Linear models, relating Y and Y-Z were fitted to farm of origin and other objective measurements. Mean attributes (range) were: mean fibre diameter, 16. 9 µm (13. 9 – 20. 4 μm); fibre curvature, 45 °/mm (31 – 59 °/mm); clean washing yield, 91. 3 % (79. 5 – 97. 3 %); Y, 78. 7 (74. 7 – 82. 2); Y-Z, 11. 9 (10. 3 – 13. 6). Farm alone accounted for 72 % {{of the variation in}} Y and 65 % of the variation in Y-Z (P < 0. 001). Once farm had been taken into account only fibre curvature (P = 0. 003) was significant in predicting Y and only clean washing yield (P = 0. 047) affected Y-Z. Neither the proportion of the fleece present as guard hair (clean cashmere yield) nor cashmere staple length was a significant determinant of Y or Y-Z. For each 10 °/mm increase in fibre curvature Y increased 1. 3 units. For each 10 % increase in clean washing yield Y-Z declined 0. 9 units. Variations in Y and Y-Z among farms were probably related to differences in geographic and climatic conditions and were significantly correlated to cashmere production. The effect of clean washing yield was probably related to a reduction in <b>suint</b> content. <br /...|$|E

This study aimed {{to quantify the}} production, fibre attributes and dehairing processing of bison fibre produced from bison grazed in north-eastern Victoria. Three age/sex classes were sampled (n = 16) at seven body positions in spring. The fibre growing area was measured. Fibre was tested for diameter distribution, clean washing yield, proportion of fine fibres < 36 µm and fine fibre length, and processed by cashmere dehairing. Bison were 12 years of age, liveweights 160450 kg and had mean fibre growing area of 1. 4 m 2. They produced an average 1184 g (range 5301640 g) of fine fibre with mean fibre diameter 18. 5 µm, clean washing yield 76. 5 %, wax content 9. 8 %, <b>suint</b> content 14. 5 %, clean fine fibre yield 56. 4 %, fine fibre length 37 mm and fibre curvature was 93 /mm. Mid-side fibre had a crimp frequency of 6. 5 /cm and mean resistance to compression of 6. 6 kPa. Fibre had a tenacity of 8. 7 cN/tex and an extension of 39. 3 %.

40|$|This study {{determines how}} levels of various trace metals in wool and the colour of the fibre {{change as a}} result of {{sunlight}} exposure and treatment with chelating compounds during wool growth. Twenty-four yearling Merino sheep were clipped on the shoulders and rumps and fitted with sheep coats modified with transparent patches. Patches over the shoulder wool (one per sheep) were either polyethylene (PE) that transmits ultraviolet light or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) that excludes ultraviolet light. The rump wool on each sheep was treated either with a copper chelator treatment (kojic acid or methyl gentisate in aqueous alcohol) or aqueous alcohol only. For 12 of the sheep the rumps were exposed to sunlight through PE patches while rump wool on the other sheep was covered by the sheep coat. Wool was harvested after 11 weeks’ growth with yellowness (Y-Z) and individual mineral contents measured using the same clean wool sample. Sunlight exposure through PE patches caused a mean increase in Y-Z to 9. 1 (shoulder) or 9. 5 – 10. 1 (rump) from a base level of 7. 1 – 7. 2 (shoulder) or 7. 0 – 7. 6 (rump) in wool protected by the sheep coat. In contrast, there was no significant change in Y-Z for the PVC patch (shoulder). Therefore, it appears that ultraviolet light damage caused the increased Y-Z. Most of the trace metals analysed increased in the shoulder wool exposed to sunlight but the paired differences for PVC were lower than PE. It appears that changes in fibre caused by sunlight exposure (especially ultraviolet light) facilitate adsorption of minerals from the environment, including the animal’s own <b>suint.</b> Application of the chelating compounds to the rump wool caused pronounced yellowing of the wool with Y-Z increase being most pronounced for kojic acid. Copper levels in the wool were reduced by kojic acid and methyl gentisate while calcium levels were increased by kojic acid and reduced by methyl gentisate. It is not clear from these findings whether minerals and copper in particular contribute to yellowing of wool. However, the different effects of sunlight and chelation on mineral contents in wool shown may well relate to alternative mechanisms of discoloration (i. e. photoyellowing versus bacterial) ...|$|E
40|$|Grazing sheep undergo {{seasonal}} variation in body condition due {{to changes in}} pasture growth and nutrient availability. Anecdotal evidence from producers suggests that during these times, individual variation exists in ‘resilience’ to these sub-optimal conditions. These ‘resilient’ individuals are able to maintain health and productivity whilst flock mates are unable to. There is little empirical evidence to verify these claims, yet they resound from producers {{in a wide range}} of production environments. The aim of this doctorate study was to define ‘resilience’ in sheep under sub-optimal nutrition, and investigate the physiological causes of variation in the trait. Three mechanisms to facilitate ‘resilience’ were proposed, namely that resilient sheep a) commenced the period of nutritional stress in better condition, B) have greater energy intake, or C) have lower energy expenditure when under sub-optimal nutrition. Two separate experiments were conducted to investigate these hypotheses under indoor and outdoor environments. From the results of both experiments, average daily weight gain (ADG) was the most appropriate measure of ‘resilience’, as it encapsulated hard to measure changes in adipose tissue depots, muscle and organ mass. Investigation of the effect of body condition and weight on subsequent response to sub-optimal nutrition (Mechanism A), revealed that a sheep’s initial body condition did not dictate ‘resilience’ to the nutritional treatment. This implies that although body reserves can serve as a useful energy reservoir, differences in efficiency do exist. Investigating the role of feed intake (Mechanism B), revealed a 1. 4 kg range in voluntary feed intake, which was associated with a 25 % range in energy digestibility. As a result of these two factors, daily digestible energy intake accounted for 48. 3 % of the variance in ADG measured. In the evaluation of Mechanism B, the use of heart rate (HR) and oxygen pulse (Oxygen uptake pet heartbeat) measures to calculate energy expenditure was evaluated. Sixty eight and 92 % of the variance in oxygen consumption could be accounted for in experiments 1 and 2 respectively. Body weight, individual sheep differences and the measurement environment all contributed significantly to the variance but most importantly, HR only had a small effect, thus implying that it can be used to oxygen consumption in the field for a given individual. The use of external logging devices to record HR of sheep whilst grazing was then evaluated in experiment 2. A combination of animal movement, rubbing activity, dust accumulation and lanolin and <b>suint</b> content of the fleece and skin between the electrodes and skin contributed to difficulties in measurement. As a result no continuous long term measures of HR were possible. These difficulties may explain the lack of published literature on the use of the monitors in sheep when compared to those using cattle and goats as experimental subjects. Future attempts to use HR as a proxy for energy expenditure in sheep will require novel methods of logging HR which avoid these constraints. No measures of energy expenditure or thyroid hormone activity were correlated with resilience in this study. Under the ad libitum low quality feeding regime implemented in experiment 2, the gross digestible energy intake consumed had the greatest effect on average daily weight gain (ADG) or ‘resilience’ to nutritional stress. Whether these differences were due to differences in appetite control or rumen microbe populations could not be determined in this study. Further investigation into the causes of individual variation in digestible energy intake and appropriate means of selection is warranted. Thesis (Ph. D.)
