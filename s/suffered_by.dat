Australia's contribution to the fighting in Normandy is commemorated in memorials and cemeteries in London and Normandy.|$|E

It was the first loss of Chandler's political career, and the worst <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> a primary candidate in Kentucky's history to that time. Barkley defeated his Republican opponent, Louisville Judge John P. Haswell, securing 62% of the general election vote. Encouraged by Barkley's success, Roosevelt campaigned against conservative Democratic incumbents in southern states, but all of these candidates won, which damaged Roosevelt's image.|$|E

George Armstrong Custer's unit at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at {{the failure of the}} Peace Policy.

The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory and the military planning for the Burma Campaign, while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany's defeat.|$|E

The shift of VRS focus to Orašje {{may have been the}} result of a desire to retaliate for the defeat <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> the RSK in western Slavonia, or meant as a quick land-grab before a peace settlement was accepted.|$|E
5|$|King {{believed}} that organized, nonviolent {{protest against the}} system of southern segregation known as Jim Crow laws would lead to extensive {{media coverage of the}} struggle for black equality and voting rights. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily deprivation and indignities <b>suffered</b> <b>by</b> Southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights workers and marchers, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the Civil Rights Movement was the most important issue in American politics in the early 1960s.|$|E
