5|$|Most sponges work {{rather like}} chimneys: they {{take in water}} {{at the bottom and}} eject it from the osculum ("little mouth") at the top. Since ambient {{currents}} are faster at the top, the suction effect that they produce by Bernoulli's principle does <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> for free. Sponges can control the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying the beat of the flagella, and may shut it down if {{there is a lot of}} sand or silt in the water.|$|E
25|$|A major work of {{research}} and synthesis, the book was also important in historiographical terms: with it, Thompson demonstrated {{the power of a}} historical Marxism rooted in the experience of real flesh-and-blood workers.

25|$|Sun Yat-sen {{successfully}} united the Revive China Society, Huaxinghui and Guangfuhui in {{the summer}} of 1905, thereby establishing the unified Tongmenghui (United League) in August 1905 in Tokyo. While it started in Tokyo, it had loose organizations distributed across and outside the country. Sun Yat-sen was the leader of this unified group. Other revolutionaries who worked with the Tongmenghui include Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin. When the Tongmenhui was established, more than 90% of the Tongmenhui members were between 17–26 years of age. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> in the era includes manhua publications, such as the Journal of Current Pictorial.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{of the new}} bridge {{began in}} November 1887. Complications arose when the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B), whose tracks ran along the north/eastern shore of the Anacostia River, sued the federal government, arguing that the bridge {{abutment}} encroached on its right-of-way; eventually the railroad agreed to move its tracks closer to the riverbank, {{and the federal government}} paid for the move. But yet more construction delays occurred. Due to the heavily silted bottom of the river, the Army Corps of Engineers could not find solid ground on which to build the bridge's piers and abutments, requiring construction of a cofferdam and extensive excavation and investigation of the riverbed. A major flood in 1888 damaged <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> and caused further delays.|$|E

25|$|Yet {{there are}} some unique {{features}} to La Rue's style. He had a liking for extreme low voice ranges, descending sometimes to C or even the subterranean B flat below the bass staff; he employed more chromaticism than most of his contemporaries; and much of his work is rich in dissonance. He also broke up long, dense textures by inserting contrasting passages for two voices only, something done also by Ockeghem and Josquin. He {{was one of the}} first routinely to expand vocal forces from the standard four, to five or six. One of his masses for six voices, the Missa Ave sanctissima Maria, is a six-voice canon, a technically difficult feat reminiscent of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Ockeghem. This is also the earliest six-voice mass known to exist.|$|E
25|$|Soon, the Train was put {{in charge}} of the landing's water supply, {{something}} that had been neglected during the early stage of the campaign. As there was no supply available, water had to be brought by sea, often in petrol tins. This responsibility was given to the Train on 12 August, they were able to source three fire engines and some hoses, which, with the Train's pontoons were used to pump supplies brought from transport ships to tanks on the beach. The fire hoses were kept under guard, and eventually replaced with metal pipe as soldiers would constantly make holes in it to get at the water inside. This was just <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> that saw the Train removed from the 11th Division and directly attached to the IX Corps Engineers, becoming responsible for all work afloat or on the beach up to the high-water mark that the Navy might require.|$|E
25|$|Among early 20th-century English {{artists who}} have more {{specially}} {{paid attention to the}} devising of bookplates, may be mentioned C. W. Sherborn, G. W. Eve, Robert Anning Bell, J. D. Batten, Erat Harrison, J. Forbes Nixon, Charles Ricketts, John Vinycomb, John Leighton and Warrington Hogg and Frank C. Papé. The development in various directions of process work, by facilitating and cheapening the reproduction of beautiful and elaborate designs, has no doubt helped much to popularize the bookplate—a thing which in older days was almost invariably restricted to ancestral libraries or to collections otherwise important. Thus the great majority of plates of the period 1880–1920 plates were reproduced by process. Some artists continued to work with the graver. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> they produce challenges comparison with the finest productions of bygone engravers. Of these the best-known are C. W. Sherborn (see Plate) and G. W. Eve in England, and in America J. W. Spenceley of Boston, Mass., K. W. F. Hopson of New Haven, Conn., and E. D. French of New York City.|$|E

25|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, the church still had some of the its former rich decor, {{including}} a gilded Churrigueresque main altar, along with two side altars with columns and capitals, along with wood sculpture of the Virgin Mary. One of these capitols is important as it relates to where the celebration of the first mass in Cuernavaca. However, in 1957 the Cathedral underwent another major remodeling by federal government. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> consisted of restoring elements to their original condition. This included the cloister’s cells, refectory, library and corridors. Some Baroque elements were added to the bell tower. But the major changes were made in the interior of the main church. The outer layers of plaster were removed, exposing mural work from the 18th century, which covers almost all of the walls of the main nave. This work {{tells the story of the}} martyrdom of Phillip of Jesus and other missionaries who were crucified in Nagasaki. The Churringueresque altars and other older elements were mostly taken out and replaced with simple modern elements, especially in the main altar area. The older decorative items were placed in a pinacotheca on the premises but are not available to the public.|$|E

500|$|The proprietors {{failed to}} raise {{all of the}} capital promised, and there were {{financial}} difficulties. The Commissioners of Sewers were unhappy with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> at Highbridge in 1830, and reported that the contractor [...] "had run away", and work had stopped in 1831. The company had also failed to lodge £1,000 with the Commissioners which was required to cover any costs they might have {{as a result of}} the construction of the canal, and they sued for the money in 1831. Even Rennie threatened to sue, as much of his fee remained unpaid. The cost of construction was about £30,000, but it appears that some debts were never paid. On 16 December 1831 the proprietors borrowed £5,000 from the Exchequer at a 5% rate of interest.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the work}} at the fort dealt with {{maintenance}} and renovation of the original structure, which had been hurriedly thrown up {{in the wake of}} the Union advance into Arlington after the secession of Virginia. An 1864 report by Brigadier General Richard Delafield, chief of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers lists an extensive series of improvements made to the fort over the previous year. This work was typically done by the soldiers of the garrison, who supplied much of the labor for all of the defenses protecting Washington. At Fort Corcoran, Delafield reported, [...] "one magazine has been rebuilt and the other two reinforced; a new bomb-proof 158feet long has been built; interior revetment repaired; embrasures newly revetted, and seven new platforms and embrasures made." [...] At Fort Corcoran, however, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> was done by contracted laborers or freed slaves, thus freeing much of the garrison for leisure time.|$|E
500|$|The {{condition}} of the swing bridge at Bathpool caused a change in policy. There were objections to the plan {{to replace it with}} a fixed bridge with limited headroom, and the planning application was deferred. By 1983, a six-year plan to restore the canal was fully costed, and it was adopted by the British Waterways Board, the County Council, Sedgemoor District Council and Taunton Deane Borough Council in the following year. The scheme was supported by the West Country Branch of the Inland Waterways Association, who offered the services of the Waterway Recovery Group, to do <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> The swing bridges at Crossways, Boat and Anchor, and Fordgate were rebuilt, and by 1987, [...] of canal were available for navigation. After some teething problems, it was decided that many {{of the rest of the}} accommodation bridges would be raised to give [...] of headroom, rather than rebuilding them as swing bridges. Restoration of the bridges at the Taunton end continued during the early 1990s, and the canal was finally re-opened in 1994.|$|E

500|$|Leyba {{developed}} a grand plan of defense {{that included the}} construction of four stone towers. Without funds or {{the time to get}} them from New Orleans, Leyba asked the villagers to contribute funds and labor to the construction of these fortifications and paid for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> from his private funds. [...] By mid-May, a single round tower had been built that was about [...] in diameter and 30 to 40 feet tall. The tower, dubbed Fort San Carlos, provided a commanding view of the surrounding countryside. As there {{did not appear to be}} sufficient time to build more towers, trenches were dug between the tower and the river to the north and south of the village. [...] Three four-pound and two six-pound cannons from Fort Don Carlos were mounted in the tower, and other cannons were emplaced at each end of the line of trenches. [...] Fort Don Carlos had been constructed earlier in 1767 on the south bank of the Missouri river, near its mouth, just 15 miles north of the village of St. Louis.|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman is a {{prominent}} {{advocate for the}} comics medium and comics literacy. [...] He believes the medium echoes the way the human brain processes information. [...] He has toured the US with a lecture called [...] "Comix 101", examining its history and cultural importance. [...] He sees comics' low status in the late 20th century as having come down from where {{it was in the}} 1930s and 1940s, when comics [...] "tended to appeal to an older audience of GIs and other adults". [...] Following the advent of the censorious Comics Code Authority in the mid-1950s, Spiegelman sees comics' potential as having stagnated until the rise of underground comix in the late 1960s. [...] He taught courses in the history and aesthetics of comics at schools such as the School of Visual Arts in New York. [...] As co-editor of Raw, he helped propel the careers of younger cartoonists whom he mentored, such as Chris Ware, and published the work of his School of Visual Arts students, such as Kaz, Drew Friedman, and Mark Newgarden.

500|$|While {{working on}} his thesis, Mayall had an idea of {{designing}} a small, fast slitless spectrograph, optimized for nebulae and galaxies. [...] He believed {{that if it were}} used in conjunction with the Crossley reflector it would make that facility competitive for at least <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> that Humason and Hubble were doing with the larger Mt. Wilson telescopes. [...] It was never expected to compete with the Mt. Wilson [...] instrument for stars or elliptical galaxies, which have condensed and relatively bright nuclei. The spectrograph was to be used instead to study extended, low-surface-brightness gaseous nebulae or irregular galaxies. [...] Mayall's thesis advisor, William Hammond Wright, and the then head of the Lick stellar spectroscopy program, Joseph Haines Moore, encouraged him to develop his spectrograph. [...] The device was constructed by the Lick Observatory's own workshop, and proved to be more efficient for extended, low-surface-brightness objects, particularly in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, thus confirming the expectations of Mayall. With Wright's strong encouragement, Mayall had used fused quartz to make ultraviolet transmitting optics, whereas the Mt. Wilson spectrographs used heavy glass lenses and prisms, which absorb ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
