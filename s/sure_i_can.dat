25|$|This {{was always}} my life, {{but now it}} takes up {{so much of my}} life that it's very difficult. In fact {{survival}} is very, very hard. My flat's nothing special – two rooms – and I live as frugally as I possibly can to make <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> campaign. I'm not trying to make myself out to be a martyr because this is my choice.|$|E
25|$|Lodge: Well, {{you are a}} {{chief of}} state. I cannot give you advice, but personally, and as a friend, and as {{somebody}} who is concerned about your health, my suggestion would be you think seriously of getting away. Now, if I can be of any help on that, I'm prepared to send my driver with an officer of mine to escort you to safety. And we can get you on my jet aircraft, and I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> deliver on that. One of my officers will ride {{in the front seat}} of my limousine with the chauffeur.|$|E
500|$|Rob Salem of Toronto Star {{said that}} [...] "fans {{who have been}} {{complaining}} about this season’s relative complacency [...] finally got their gore and more when the farm was overrun by suddenly, strangely single-minded walkers." [...] Pamela Mitchell of Houston Chronicle commented that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] was the most eventful episode of the season, while Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery thought that [...] "every single major character gets their moment to shine"; [...] "Epic, action-packed, emotional—'Beside the Dying Fire' is great television," [...] she concluded. TV Guide television critic Michael Logan affirmed that the season finale [...] "was so scary and shock-a-minute outrageous that it nearly made our heads explode." [...] In his A– review, Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club said that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] adequately accomplished what he was hoping for. He wrote, [...] "We're finally off Hershel's farm, in about the most definitive way imaginable: The barn has been burned, and the house itself is overrun by a herd of 'walkers'." [...] New York Starlee Kine adulated the installment, and asserted that it was comparable to episodes of The Walking Dead first season. [...] "It’s just amazing how much smoother the plot holes go down when something is actually happening on this show. For {{the first time since}} last season, I felt engrossed enough to not be consumed with all the small things this show gets wrong. Up until this episode, the majority of this season has consisted exclusively of small things: petty dramas, misdirected stakes, so much stalling. I’m not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{go so far as to}} say that it got everything right with this one, but at least it was entertaining and the nonstop action felt like content instead of just bookends." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program [...] "ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] sufficiently encompassed a climax for its storylines, adding that it left the audience anticipating for future installments of the series.|$|E

I cannot offer you great wealth, but I say with {{confidence}} that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> offer you something better, something <b>surer.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{take care of}} you and protect you, and I will devote my life to your happiness. Will you marry me?" ...|$|R

2500|$|The second show I {{ever saw}} of the Descendents {{was at the}} Dancing Waters in San Pedro. They broke into the set and he was playing guitar so hard and so angry that his pants fell down. He was an odd character, for <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{remember}} standing in line at a Misfits show {{and all of a}} sudden he just sat down on the ground and started holding his head like his ears were ringing or something, and said something to the effect of [...] "What am I doing here? Where am I?" [...] So that was Frank.|$|E
2500|$|After being {{spotted by}} Geoff Cook, Durham's coach, Onions made his second XI debut {{for the club}} {{at the age of}} 18. He was offered a {{contract}} with the club and opted to become a professional cricketer rather than take a sports science choice at university, which was his other option. Onions started in the team as the fourth bowler. Looking back on his early career, he felt that he tried too hard early on. On one occasion he recalled how [...] "I remember being thrown the ball at an important stage of a game at Scarborough, and Phil Jaques hit me for four successive fours. I was thinking 'I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do this.' But Dale Benkenstein was a huge influence as captain, and you have to learn from all those experiences. Otherwise I could not have done what I did in my first season of Test cricket. I often went for 15 to 20 runs in my first three overs, but always came back strongly." [...] In 2006, Onions regularly opened the bowling for Durham with Ottis Gibson.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} charge of obscurantism, other {{analytic}} philosophers considered the actual content of Heidegger's work to be either faulty and meaningless, vapid or uninteresting. However, not all analytic philosophers have been as hostile. Gilbert Ryle wrote a critical yet positive review of Being and Time. Ludwig Wittgenstein made a remark recorded by Friedrich Waismann: [...] "To be <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> imagine what Heidegger means by being and anxiety" [...] which has been construed by some commentators as sympathetic to Heidegger's philosophical approach. These positive and negative analytic evaluations have been collected in Michael Murray (ed.), Heidegger and Modern Philosophy: Critical Essays (Yale University Press, 1978). Heidegger's reputation within English-language philosophy has slightly improved in philosophical terms in some part {{through the efforts of}} Hubert Dreyfus, Richard Rorty, and a recent generation of analytically oriented phenomenology scholars. Pragmatist Rorty claimed that Heidegger's approach to philosophy {{in the first half of}} his career has much in common with that of the latter-day Ludwig Wittgenstein. Nevertheless, Rorty asserted that what Heidegger had constructed in his writings was a myth of being rather than an account of it.|$|E
