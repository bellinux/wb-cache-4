25|$|Wiener was {{an early}} studier of {{stochastic}} and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems. It was Wiener's idea to model a signal {{as if it were}} an exotic type of noise, giving it a sound mathematical basis. The example we give our students nowadays is that English text could be modeled as a random string of letters and spaces, where each letter of the alphabet (and the space) has an assigned probability. But Wiener dealt with analog signals, where <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> example doesn't exist. Wiener is unlucky in that his early work on information theory and signal processing was limited to analog signals, and was largely forgotten with the development of the digital theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{transmission}} of plane waves through a homogeneous medium are fully {{described in terms}} of Jones vectors and 2×2 Jones matrices. However, in practice there are cases in which all of the light cannot be viewed in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> manner due to spatial inhomogeneities or the presence of mutually incoherent waves. So-called depolarization, for instance, cannot be described using Jones matrices. For these cases it is usual instead to use a 4×4 matrix that acts upon the Stokes 4-vector. Such matrices were first used by Paul Soleillet in 1929, although they have {{come to be known as}} Mueller matrices. While every Jones matrix has a Mueller matrix, the reverse is not true. Mueller matrices are then used to describe the observed polarization effects of the scattering of waves from complex surfaces or ensembles of particles, as shall now be presented.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} to use prisms rather than gratings as a dispersive elements, as in Figure 3. Despite <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> change the set-up behaves quite differently, as to first order no group delay dispersion is introduced. Such a stretcher/compressor can have both a positive or negative dispersion, depending on the geometry and the material properties of the prisms. With lenses, {{the sign of the}} dispersion can be reversed, similar to Figure 2. For a given distance between the dispersive elements, prisms generate much less dispersion than gratings. Prisms and gratings are sometimes combined to correct higher order dispersion ("grisms"), in which case the distance between the prisms is on the order of 10 meters rather than 50cm as with a grating compressor. Gratings lose power into the other orders while prisms lose power due to Rayleigh scattering.|$|E
25|$|Dionysius {{copied the}} last decennovenal {{cycle of the}} Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with {{numbered}} Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi (Years of our Lord Jesus Christ) because, as he explained to Petronius, he {{did not wish to}} continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did not realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle × cycle of leap years × days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years, otherwise he would have stated <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> fact.|$|E

On the first day of internship, O'Malley is selected by chief of cardiothoracic surgery Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) as the first intern to perform surgery. He freezes in the operating room, and is mocked by his peers, and earns the nickname [...] "007" [...] because of almost killing a patient in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> operation (referring to James Bond's [...] "licence to kill"). O'Malley dates nurse Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback), breaking up with her when he contracts syphilis from her, which she in turn contracted from Karev. His friendship with Karev is further strained when the two become trapped in an elevator with a patient who begins to bleed out. Karev freezes, and O'Malley is able to save the patient single-handedly. He goes on to admit his feelings to Meredith, and the two have a one-night stand. When Meredith tells him that sleeping together was a mistake, O'Malley begins avoiding her and starts dating orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez).|$|E
500|$|Whether {{or not the}} characters' simple speech helps build basic {{language}} skills has been debated. Los Angeles Times critic Lynne Heffley commended the interactive aspects of the show but mentioned that the simplified dialogue can distract from the educational content.

[...] In her Common Sense Media review, Andrea Graham stated that the language [...] "should {{not be seen as}} detrimental to a child's speech development – rather, it's a language that young children understand and appreciate." [...] Jaime Egan of Families.com wrote negatively of the dialogue but felt that it did not divert from the educational value. She wrote that [...] "even though the characters do not speak in complete sentences ... the lessons that this show teaches can be invaluable." [...] The hosts of Ray William Johnson's Equals Three criticized the simplified language, stating that the puppets [...] "didn't even use full sentences. They just said enough words to make themselves understood." [...] Amy Sohn of New York magazine expressed her opinion that the language ruined the show as a whole, calling the characters [...] "speech-impaired."

[...] Vestal asked to be heard in opposition to the amendment, stating that his committee, after recommending the Bennington bill, had decided to promote no further coin bills. He added that because of this, Washington Representative Albert Johnson had agreed to withdraw his bill for a commemorative honoring the centennial of Fort Vancouver, in his state. The Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Finis J. Garrett of Tennessee, asked why the committee had not set the rule before considering the Bennington bill, and Vestal admitted that was hard to answer. The House voted, and the California amendment was added. But Representative Johnson to applause from his colleagues moved a further amendment, to add [...] "and Vancouver, Wash."
