60|$|How {{to obtain}} and <b>secure</b> this <b>amount</b> {{is one of}} the {{questions}} to taken into consideration in judging of the proper constitution of a representative body. In proportion as its composition fails to <b>secure</b> this <b>amount,</b> the assembly will encroach, by special acts, on the province of the executive; it will expel a good, or elevate and uphold a bad ministry; it will connive at, or overlook in them, abuses of trust, will be deluded by their false pretenses, or will withhold support from those who endeavour to fulfill their trust conscientiously; it will countenance or impose a selfish, a capricious and impulsive, a short-sighted, ignorant, and prejudiced general policy, foreign and domestic; it will abrogate good laws, or enact bad ones; let in new evils, or cling with perverse obstinacy to old; it will even, perhaps, under misleading impulses, momentary or permanent, emanating from itself or from its constituents, tolerate or connive at proceedings which set law aside altogether, in cases where equal justice would not be agreeable to popular feeling. Such are among the dangers of representative government, arising from a constitution of the representation which does not <b>secure</b> an adequate <b>amount</b> of intelligence and knowledge in the representative assembly.|$|R

30|$|Most of the {{enterprises}} of the World {{belong to}} the class of microenterprises and thus, the contributions of microenterprises to the national economic growth {{and development of the}} countries are not ignorable. Establishing a microenterprise does not involve the huge formalities and substantial funds that small, medium and large enterprises require. However, for a healthy growth of microenterprises, the determining factors must be identified and policies should be undertaken and implemented in an appropriate manner. The objective of the current study is to identify different potential factors that contribute to the overall growth of the Malaysian microenterprises. Computing descriptive statistics and applying multiple regression analysis to data for 253 microenterprises of Malaysia, the study finds that a certain number of entrepreneurial and enterprise characteristics along with several economic factors affect the overall performance of microenterprises. Specifically, it is found that competition and the age of the enterprises negatively affect overall performance of the microenterprises whereas age of the entrepreneurs, education, business training, demand for the product/service, availability of physical space for business expansion in the city area, availability of financing and sufficiency of <b>secured</b> <b>amount</b> of finance pose positive impacts on the growth. The results of this study provide some insights to policymakers and business practitioners to address the determinants pertaining to microenterprise growth.|$|R
40|$|En: Hermeneutics and the Tradition compilado por Daniel O. Dahlstrom. Washington: American Catholic Philosophical Association, 1988, pp. 212 - 24. Quine's Indeterminacy of Translation {{thesis is}} {{grounded}} in language-verificationism [...] the claim that language contains no unverifiable relation. Quine's thesis issues in a hermeneutic doctrine {{to the effect that}} exegetical disputes are empty, any construal's correctness depending on the choice of a translation manual alone. Gadamer, on the other hand, maintains that a sense is bestowed upon a text by the interpreter's understanding horizon, the comprehension thus <b>secured</b> <b>amounting</b> to a merging of horizons. Translation, according to Gadamer, is to be conceived as a recreation (Nachbildung). While there are differences between Quine's and Gadamer' s views, I emphasize their deep agreements. They both are in the end committed to embrace sense-relativism and so to regard clashing interpretations as correct upon adequate choices. That relativism is found fault with; for it entails that philosophical deliberation is futile, insomuch as a philosophical system can be construed {{in such a way as}} to be equivalent to another, when what was going on was pondering on which of them, if any, was true. The paper concludes by rejecting the assumptions Quine's and Gadamer's hermeneutic doctrines of sense-indeterminacy are based onPeer reviewe...|$|R
