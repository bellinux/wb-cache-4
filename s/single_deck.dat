She was armed with four torpedo tubes and a <b>single</b> <b>deck</b> gun, though a second was added during her career.|$|E
25|$|For these routes Messrs Stevenson and Company of New York {{supplied}} three {{double deck}} and one <b>single</b> <b>deck</b> cars, and in 1880 Starbucks constructed five more <b>single</b> <b>deck</b> tram cars, {{similar to those}} originally supplied.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, three Atlanteans were bodied by Marshall as <b>single</b> <b>deck</b> buses for Great Yarmouth Corporation. By 1972, over 6,000 Atlanteans {{had entered}} service.|$|E
50|$|In {{the later}} years route 66 was {{simplified}} and now used just ten low-floor Mercedes-Benz O405 <b>single</b> <b>decks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The route was {{operated}} by twelve two-step entrance Leyland Lynx, E F G and H registration plate 'Leyland DAF Lynxs'Around 2000 the 'Lynxs', were gradually phased out and National Express West Midlands invested in low-floored <b>single</b> <b>decks,</b> using around eighteen {{on the route}} at one stage.|$|R
50|$|The <b>single</b> car <b>deck</b> had ramps at each end.|$|R
25|$|Four {{new cars}} by Brush, Loughborough, {{supplied}} in 1896. After electrification {{they were used}} as trailers, {{and two of them}} were later converted into <b>single</b> <b>deck</b> trams, numbered 50 and 51.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, {{although}} the Comet built in India from 1953 was selling phenomenally well {{there was a}} demand for heavier duty <b>single</b> <b>decks.</b> Ashok Leyland, the Indian-based joint venture, started producing {{its own version of}} the Tiger, which used the axles of the Ashok Leyland Hippo lorry. It could be seen as a group replacement for the Albion Viking (CX/HD series).|$|R
25|$|The {{double deck}} fleet {{consists}} of Volvo B7TLs with Alexander ALX400 bodies and Volvo B9TLs with Wright Eclipse-Gemini bodywork. The <b>single</b> <b>deck</b> fleet {{is made up}} of Dennis Dart SLF Alexander Pointer 2s and Alexander Dennis Enviro200s.|$|E
25|$|Starbucks {{provided}} five <b>single</b> <b>deck</b> {{cars for}} the Basford service. By December 1879 {{the company had}} twenty cars running on the three sections, employing 192 horses, and {{the average number of}} passengers was from 50,000 to 60,000 each week.|$|E

This variant {{is commonly known as}} [...] "forty points" [...] (...) or [...] "competing over a hundred points" [...] (...) [...]|$|R
50|$|Electroputere VFU's {{concept of}} R&R („Redesign and Reconstruct”) was applied {{on more than}} 10 {{different}} projects for Diesel Multiple Units, passenger coaches (<b>single</b> or double <b>deck,</b> <b>single</b> unit or multiple units), trams and freight wagons.|$|R
50|$|Other oddities at {{the dawn}} of the 1960s {{included}} single-deck buses on the double-deck AEC Regent V chassis, most of these were built for South Wales Transport for a route with a very low railway bridge in Llanelli under which underfloor engined <b>single</b> <b>decks</b> could not work but there were also one each for the Leeds Council Welfare department (with a rear ramp for wheelchair access) and for the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation.|$|R
25|$|In 2014, {{the company}} had 105 vehicles.

25|$|However, {{even when}} basic and composition-dependent {{strategy}} lead to different actions, {{the difference in}} expected reward is small, and it becomes even smaller with more decks. Using a composition-dependent strategy rather than basic strategy in a <b>single</b> <b>deck</b> game reduces the house edge by 4 in 10,000, which falls to 3 in 100,000 for a six-deck game.|$|E
25|$|Casinos {{generally}} compensate by tightening other {{rules in}} games with fewer decks, {{in order to}} preserve the house edge or discourage play altogether. When offering <b>single</b> <b>deck</b> blackjack games, casinos are more likely to disallow doubling on soft hands or after splitting, to restrict resplitting, require higher minimum bets, and to pay the player less than 3:2 for a winning blackjack.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1930s with Lioness frames {{exhausted}} {{the later}} full-size Normal-control Leyland-built <b>single</b> <b>decks</b> were called Tigresses, an L prefix was added for left-hand drive versions, {{such as the}} large batch of LLTB3 ordered by Riga City Council. 71 of the ordered 90 of which were delivered to Latvia before {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War. The only UK customers for Tigresses were exclusive up-market coach-tour firms like Southdown Motor Services who took the LTB3 (equivalent to the TS6) or the LTB5 (equivalent to the TS8).|$|R
500|$|The {{boats were}} {{designed}} with five [...] torpedo tubes; four {{located in the}} bow, one in the stern. The boats' armament was to also include a <b>single</b> /26 <b>deck</b> gun.|$|R
25|$|Their {{double deck}} fleet only {{consists}} of Volvo B7TL Alexander ALX400 {{due to the}} height of their garage. Their <b>single</b> <b>deck</b> fleet is slightly more varied though {{with a couple of}} Alexander Dennis Enviro200s and some Volvo B7RLE Wright Eclipse Urbans. Having operated Ipswich's park & ride service from 2008 until November 2013, in July 2017 First Ipswich resumed operating the service.|$|E

25|$|Devon General's first buses were AEC YC type with roofless {{double-deck}} bodies typical at the time. A second-hand AEC B-type {{was bought}} from the London General Omnibus Company in 1920 but was rebuilt {{after a few}} months. The Torquay Tramways purchased six AEC K-type double deck buses in 1921 which were transferred to the Devon General fleet the following year. Double deck buses delivered from 1929 were fitted with roofs and by 1932 the open top buses had been sold or rebuilt as <b>single</b> <b>deck</b> vehicles.|$|E

25|$|The eight centenary {{cars are}} <b>single</b> <b>deck,</b> one-man {{operated}} trams with flat ends and a revised door layout, {{giving them a}} more bus-like appearance compared to previous tramcar designs. They were numbered 641–648 (648 originally numbered 651) and have a capacity of 52 passengers (of which 16 are standing). The position of the doors means {{that they can be}} operated by just a driver, as opposed to having a crew of two or three on board. This was useful during low season and early morning/late night services when there was little demand, as it allowed the network to keep labour costs down.|$|E
