5000|$|The term [...] "car" [...] is {{commonly}} used by itself in American English when a rail context is implicit. Indian English sometimes uses [...] "bogie" [...] in the same manner, though the term has other meanings in other variants of English. In American English, [...] "railcar" [...] is a generic term for a railway vehicle; in other countries [...] "railcar" [...] refers specifically to a <b>self-propelled,</b> <b>powered,</b> railway vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Westinghouse Brake & Saxby Signal Co.

In the UK, the Style 'L' all-electric miniature <b>power</b> lever <b>frame</b> was the most predominant on UK main line railways.|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} 1889 {{signal box}} {{was replaced with}} an electro-pneumatic power-operated box based on the Westinghouse system. Work started in October 1907 and it opened on 5 April 1908. It was built directly over the River Clyde, sitting between the two river bridges, above {{the level of the}} tracks. Inside was a frame of 374 miniature levers, making it the longest <b>power</b> <b>frame</b> ever built in Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|Aerobus is a <b>self-propelled</b> {{electrically}} <b>powered</b> bus-like vehicle {{riding on}} a suspended overhead cable. The cable arrangement, {{similar to a}} suspension bridge, allows for long spans of up to 600 metres between pylons.

30|$|In the {{droop control}} strategy, {{the change in}} load is managed by the {{distributed}} generators in a prearranged way and decentralized control of parallel inverters is designed based {{on the use of}} the system frequency as a communication link within the microgrid. This method has two problems, i.e. power coupling and slop selection. However, power coupling can be avoided through some improve strategies such as virtual <b>power</b> <b>frame</b> transformation or virtual output impedance, though the swapping between the power-sharing and voltage, amplitude, and frequency deviation depends on the selection of the droop coefficient m and n.|$|R

Near by stood a tall crane watching us solemnly, and above in the tree-top a parrot vociferously proclaimed his knowledge of our presence. I was wondering if he objected to our invasion, at the same time taking a most welcome bite for lunch, when directly in front of me the water flew up as if propelled by some submarine <b>power.</b> <b>Framed</b> in a shower of spray I saw an immense tarpon, with mouth agape and fins stiff, close in pursuit of frantically leaping little fish.|$|R
50|$|Power {{signalling}} {{arrived in}} 1910 in Sydney Yard, with the commissioning of (Sydney) Station Box. This installation was electro-pneumatic and controlled from a miniature lever frame {{supplied by the}} McKenzie, Holland & Westinghouse Power Signal Co. of Worcester, England. Although the lines were not continuously track-circuited and absolute block telegraph remained between signalboxes, there was some control of signals by track circuit and treadle. Upon its replacement by a 432 lever pistol grip <b>power</b> <b>frame</b> in the new Sydney Station West signalbox in the late 1920s, the original miniature lever frame was divided into smaller sections for reuse at other locations. The disused 'Station Box' remained in position for decades after its retirement, but has now been demolished, along with its successor.|$|R
50|$|A box motor, in {{railroad}} terminology, is a <b>self-propelled</b> boxcar, normally <b>powered</b> by {{electricity and}} running on an interurban railway or a streetcar line. Many box motors were converted from passenger {{cars on the}} systems that ran them, with the seats {{and most of the}} windows removed and large freight doors fitted. They were generally used for express and less-than-carload freight.|$|R

Like most smart camera vendors, FastVision’s suite includes FPGA processing and memory subsystems to enable in-camera image processing. When integrated with a high <b>powered</b> <b>frame</b> grabber or vision processor board (or a host subsystem), the resulting system capabilities can be expanded beyond simple image compression. The smart camera subsystem can be integrated with disk or non-volatile semiconductor storage inside or outside the camera to hold sustained real-time data acquisition, a valuable aid to system effectiveness when network connectivity is overloaded or is unavailable.|$|R

Based on design of hybrid multimode synchronous teeth belt transmission, programmable load unit, programmable power source and data fusion operator, main composition of the laboratory equipment are developed. Distributed control is used to ensure the laboratory equipment work orderly. To improve ability of anti-electromagnetic interference, three methods are used. Practically use, the synthetically laboratory equipment is proved to being high stability, strong comprehensiveness, good generality...|$|R

50|$|In Green Lantern Corps #11 (vol. 2) Mogo {{apparently}} shows Kilowog {{images of}} his dead species, pushing him into madness and hatred toward the Green Lantern Corps. He then starts tampering with {{the minds of}} the Lanterns seeking advice and counseling, in the form of illusions granted by Mogo's <b>powers,</b> <b>framing</b> Guy Gardner for killing and pitting the Lanterns against each other. This behavior seems to be caused by the virus Despotellis of the Sinestro Corps, and according to Guy Gardner was actually unnoticed by the planet, who was immune to the fungus himself (stated by Green Man in issue #13). After the fungus made itself known by drilling towards Mogo's core, the sentient planet proceeded to shift its orbit into the path of an asteroid whose impact noticeably scars Mogo but eradicates the fungus, whose remnants are destroyed by the other Lanterns.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} {{controlled}} by power-operated signalling from a cabin. When the double metre-gauge line from the station up to Tambaram was electrified in 1931 with the 1,500v DC overhead system, automatic signalling was provided between the station and Madras Egmore. However, it does not signal the broad-gauge line of the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway from Rayapuram, which also serves the station. The single line to Rayapuram {{was controlled by}} the Theobald's Token instrument, invented by an engineer of the Madras Railway and manufactured locally in the city by a firm named Orr & Co, which was used extensively on the lines of both the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway and the South Indian Railway. It was housed in the station office. The signalling of the station is controlled from Siemens all-electric <b>power</b> <b>frame</b> of 1935.|$|R
