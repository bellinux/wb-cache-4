Further, many of the vehicles are occupied by passengers that would nevertheless consist of multiple passengers, for example a parent with multiple children being escorted to school.|$|R

I use a qualitative narrative analysis of the Canadian government’s publications on the issue of human trafficking including policy, programming, and research-related documents. The findings reveal that Canada has implemented an approach which emphasizes the safety and security of the country which is indicative of a narrative that frames international sex trafficking as a threat. These findings further reveal a negative impact of such framing on trafficking victims. In employing an approach which prioritizes the safety and security of the state, Canada neglects the notion that human trafficking violates a person’s human rights, overlooks a consideration of the root causes of trafficking, and under-prioritizes the notion of ‘victim’ despite the phenomenon continuing to produce new victims each year in Canada...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionThe triage {{nurse in}} the {{emergency}} centre (EC) is the first person that a patient encounters and the triage nurses’ knowledge has been cited as an influential factor in triage decision-making. The purpose {{was to assess the}} triaging knowledge and skills of nurses working in the ECs in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. MethodsBoth descriptive cross-sectional and observational study designs were used and data was collected using a structured questionnaire, an observation checklist and a triage equipment audit record. The study population was all nurses (enrolled and registered) working within the EC of the national hospital and three municipal district hospitals in Dar es Salaam. Descriptive statistical data analysis was carried out using SPSS 13. 0. ResultsThirty three percent (20 / 60) of the respondents were not knowledgeable about triage. Thirteen percent of the respondents reported that although they had attended workshops, there had been a lack of information on how to triage patients. More than half (52 %) of the respondents were not able to allocate the patient to the appropriate triage category. Fifty eight percent (35 / 60) of the respondents had no knowledge on waiting time limits for the triaged categories. Among the four hospitals observed, only one had nurses <b>specifically</b> <b>allocated</b> <b>for</b> patients’ triage. The respiratory rate of patients was not assessed by 84 % of the triage nurses observed. No pain assessment was done by any of the triage nurses observed. Only one out of four ECs assessed had triage guidelines and triage assessment forms. DiscussionNurses who participated in this study demonstrated significant deficits in knowledge and skills regarding patients’ triaging in the EC. To correct these deficits, immediate in-service training/education workshops should be carried out, followed by continuous professional development on a regular basis, including refresher training, supportive supervision and clinical skills sessions...|$|R

40|$|Background & Objectives: Major {{incidents}} occur commonly in Uganda, {{but little}} is known about either local hazards which risk causing major incidents, or health system preparedness for such events. Understanding risk and current preparedness {{is the first step in}} improving response. Methods: We undertook a cross - sectional study across four teaching hospitals in Kampala (Mulago National Referral Hospital, Nsambya Hospital, Mengo Hospital and Lubaga Hospital). A local geographic area Hazard Vulnerability Analysis (HVA) f or each site was combined with a key informant questionnaire and standardized facility checklist within the hospitals. Data collected included status of major incident committees, operational major incident plans and facility major incident operation centres, bed capacity, equipment and supplies and staffing. The HVA assessed the human impact, impact on property and on business of the hazards as well as measures for mitigation (preparedness, internal response and external response) in place at the hospitals. Results: Only one of the four hospitals was found to have had an operational major incident plan. The designated coordinator for major incidents across all facilities was mostly a general surgeon; no funds were <b>specifically</b> <b>allocated</b> <b>for</b> planning. All hospitals have procedures for triage, resuscitation, stabilization and treatment. None of the facilities had officially designated a major incident committee. All the facilities had sufficient supplies for daily use but none had specifically stock piled any reserves for major incidents. All hospitals were staffed by at least a medical officer, clinical officers, nurses and a specialist with procedures for mobilizing extra staff s for major incidents. Some staffs had received some emergency care training in courses namely basic life support, advanced trauma life support, primary trauma care and emergency triage and treatment but no team had received training in major incident response. Only one hospital carried out annual simulation exercises. Incidents involving human hazards specifically bomb threats, road crash mass casualty incidents, civil disorder and epidemics posed the highest risk to all four hospitals and yet preparation and response measures were inadequate. Conclusion: Hospitals in Kampala face a wide range of hazards and frequent major incidents but despite this they remain under - prepared to respond. Large gaps were identified in as far as staffing, equipment and infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|CARIM-East: Creating an Observatory of Migration East of EuropeThe {{integration}} of migrants {{is becoming an}} increasingly important question in Belarus. As socio-economic cooperation between Belarus and other countries is developing the list {{of participants in the}} integration process of migrants is growing. For several decades, the traditional participants were citizens from neighboring countries: Russia, Ukraine and Poland. At the present there is also, though, rapid growth in migration flows from other areas, particularly from the south: Turkmenistan, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Turkey and the countries of South Asia including China and Vietnam. This paper presents a study of the scope and structure of the main participants in the integration process, in terms of country of birth and country of citizenship. The main data sources are the census, data on vital and education statistics. The results suggest that integration in Belarus is not a serious problem, being similar to other social processes. One of the key explanations for this is the influx of people from the former Soviet Union, above all, those who lived in Belarus themselves or had relatives there. The {{integration of}} migrants in Belarus is most evident in the labor market. The most common areas of integration for labor migrants from the older migrant nations are in industry, agriculture and trade. Citizens from the new areas are, on the other hand, concentrated in trade, health and education. The new migrants include more young males with higher-level skills. Among these, more than half are professionals. The vast majority of the new migrants come to Belarus to pursue higher education or under the guise of education. The old trends mean greater integration dispersion in terms of employment, skill levels and education, but also in terms of age. The study emphasizes the need for a special policy for the adaptation and integration of migrants, something particularly important for citizens from unusual areas due to differences in culture, language and religion. Special attention should be paid to the knowledge of Russian and Belarusian, the possibility of buying or renting housing, the use of free education and health care services, etc. At this point in Belarus there are no obstacles for migrants wishing to integrate, but there are no authorities <b>specifically</b> <b>allocated</b> <b>for</b> that purpose.

Drug exposure in utero has been associated with deleterious effects on the fetus and newborn. Public health officials are currently confronted with difficult policy decisions with regard to testing and reporting of pregnant and post-partum women and the provision of appropriate services. The widespread lack of consistent policy on the State level has led to bias in testing and reporting procedures and to the inappropriate use of the legal system as a deterrent to drug use during pregnancy. A survey of the 50 States and the District of Columbia found that no State currently has enacted legislation regarding testing. Thirteen States have mandatory reporting policies for drug-exposed newborns. Eleven of these States require reporting to social service agencies, at least 3 States routinely report to criminal justice agencies, and 10 require that reports be filed as child abuse or neglect.
