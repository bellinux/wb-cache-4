5|$|By {{the turn}} of the century Dallas was the leading {{wholesale}} market in the entire Southwestern United States for many products. More important it became the world center for the cotton trade. It led the world in the manufacturing of <b>saddlery</b> and cotton gin machinery. As it further entered the 20th century, Dallas built up a major presence in banking and insurance.|$|E
5|$|Holden, {{formally}} {{known as}} General Motors Holden, is an Australian automobile importer {{and a former}} automobile manufacturer with its headquarters in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The company was founded in 1856 as a <b>saddlery</b> manufacturer in South Australia. In 1908 it moved into the automotive field, becoming {{a subsidiary of the}} United States-based General Motors (GM) in 1931 named General Motors-Holden's Ltd. It was renamed Holden Ltd in 1998, and General Motors Holden in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} force's history, most of its {{equipment}} and weapons had to be imported from abroad, {{due to the lack}} of indigenous Canadian industry. Its early <b>saddlery</b> and wagons were imported from the United States, although the police's uniforms were made locally. After 1887, political pressure grew to use Canadian suppliers whenever possible. Supplies of food and similar goods were initially bought from the major trading companies in the west, such as the Hudson's Bay Company, but this gradually changed once more of the territories were settled and goods could be purchased from smaller, local firms, with the police becoming an important source of business. Equipment and supplies had to be bought from companies that supported the government of the day, and after 1896 a formal list of politically approved suppliers was kept by the comptroller's office. All of the police's guns had to be imported, {{due to the lack of}} indigenous manufacturers, and by 1890s the force was still buying most of its ammunition from abroad, as Canadian-manufactured cartridges remained substandard.|$|E
50|$|Reisterstown Historic District is a {{national}} historic district in Reisterstown, Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. Its development is inseparably identified with the roads that converge to form Main Street. They are Maryland Route 30 and Maryland Route 140. The earliest structures, including several of log, date to the late 18th century, although the town was founded in 1758. It developed as a convenient stopping place for weary travelers from the outer reaches of Western Maryland or Pennsylvania and many businesses catered to the traveler: including taverns and inns, smithshops, <b>saddleries,</b> stables, waggoners.|$|R
50|$|The Cocula {{region is}} {{primarily}} agrarian in nature, growing not only corn, agave, sorghum, chickpeas, alfalfa, mangoes {{and is one}} of the nations top sugar cane producers; but also raising to a lesser degree, pigs, poultry, goats, and cattle. Cocula City is also the head of local commerce, with a wide range of specialized retailers of food, clothing, shoes, and construction materials, while also serving as the primary center for general services such as banks, hospitals, car repair shops and other services within the region, and its also home of many <b>saddleries.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 1900 {{there were}} many {{commercial}} businesses in the villages including butchers, bakers, hotels, <b>saddleries,</b> smithies, bootmakers, mercers, tailors, motor vehicle garages and billiard rooms. A post office was operating by 1897. The current Royal Hotel was rebuilt in 1911, an earlier timber building having been destroyed by fire. The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney opened a branch at Woodstock in 1907, followed by the Commonwealth Savings Bank in 1913 and the Bank of New South Wales in 1929. The Soldiers Memorial Hall was opened in 1925 by Sir Neville Reginald Howse, who {{was at that time}} the Member for Calare.|$|R
5|$|In 1852, James Alexander Holden {{emigrated to}} South Australia from Walsall, England and in 1856 {{established}} J.A. Holden & Co, a <b>saddlery</b> business in Adelaide. In 1885, German-born H. A. Frost joined the {{business as a}} junior partner and J.A. Holden & Co became Holden & Frost Ltd. Edward Holden, James' grandson, joined the firm in 1905 {{with an interest in}} automobiles. From there, the firm evolved through various partnerships and, in 1908, Holden & Frost moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery. The company began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies in 1913, and Edward experimented with fitting bodies to different types of carriages. After 1917, wartime trade restrictions led the company to start full-scale production of vehicle body shells. J.A. Holden founded a new company in 1919, Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd (HMBB) specialising in car bodies and using a facility on King William Street in Adelaide.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the number}} of pack animals and {{carriers}} was limited, the requirements for stores and supplies of all types, including rations, ammunition, ordnance, signals equipment and medical supplies, were submitted to 7th Division headquarters, which allocated movement priorities. One of Richardson's first actions was to obtain more <b>saddlery</b> for the pack horses. He also acquired five more American jeeps to augment the five that had been working the jeep track. The original five {{were found to be}} in poor condition, and needed overhaul. While the 25th Infantry Brigade was conducting operations in the Imita Ridge area, the carry was short, {{and despite the fact that}} there were no suitable air dropping zones, the supply situation was good. As the Australians began advancing toward Kokoda again in October, the supply line became steadily longer, and the demand for carriers more acute.|$|E
5|$|The mounted police {{initially}} deployed with 310 {{horses in}} 1873, both as mounts and as draught animals, but {{large numbers of}} these died on the march, and {{for much of the}} 1870s there were shortages of horses, impacting on the police's work. The importance of horses to the force's work grew, particularly once the new patrol system was introduced by Commissioner Herchmer. By the 1880s the police's horses were looked after carefully and given good veterinarian support, although they were worked very hard. A large riding school was built in Regina at a cost of $30,000 in 1886 to allow training throughout the cold winter months. At their peak {{towards the end of the}} century, the force owned around 800 horses, and needed to purchase 100 new mounts each year. The police initially used a wide range of <b>saddlery,</b> mostly of the British Army's Universal pattern, but this was found to be unsuitable for the prairies. After some experimentation, the force settled on the Western, or Californian, style of saddle in the 1880s, which was more comfortable for both the rider and horse.|$|E
5000|$|In 1846, the {{population}} was 2,111 {{and there were many}} buildings made of stone. There was a court house and jail, six churches or chapels, and a steamboat pier for travel to and from Montreal and Kingston. Two newspapers were published, there were two bank agencies and the post office received mail daily. Several court and government departments had offices here. There was little industry yet, but one grist mill, four tanneries, two asheries and four wagon makers were operating, in addition to tradesmen of various types. [...] Later in the 19th century the town developed as a local centre of industry, including shipbuilding, <b>saddleries,</b> tanneries, tinsmiths, a foundry, a brewery, and several hotels. By 1854, a patent medicine industry had sprung up in Brockville and in Morristown, New York, across the St. Lawrence River, featuring such products as [...] "Dr Morse's Indian Root Pills", [...] "Dr. McKenzie's Worm Tablets," [...] and later, [...] "Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People".|$|R
5|$|The {{weaponry}} {{and equipment}} of the Australian Army had mostly been standardised on that {{used by the}} British Army prior to the outbreak of World War I. Meanwhile, in the {{years prior to the}} war basic defence industries had been established in Australia for the production of uniforms, webbing, boots, small arms and explosives and ammunition. Despite this, the majority of the equipment initially issued came from British Army stocks until Australian production was able to be increased to meet the demand that resulted from rapid military expansion {{at the start of the}} war. These included such items as heliographs, water bottles, bits, stirrups, spurs and shovels, although <b>saddlery</b> and harnesses were provided by a local government manufacturer. Although Australia had a relatively limited industrial base during the war, it was ultimately able to supply the majority of the Army's more simple requirements; however, the remainder of the more complex equipment had to be purchased from suppliers in Britain.|$|E
25|$|Turner <b>Saddlery</b> {{similarly}} honored Hathcock {{by producing}} {{a line of}} leather rifle slings based on his design. The slings are embossed with Hathcock's signature.|$|E
25|$|Smaller {{specialised}} businesses include Caterham on the Hill's only traditional country Saddler, est 1988 {{known as}} Unicorn Leather <b>Saddlery.</b> They {{are responsible for}} manufacturing their own products to include the safety and first aid product called the Locata TM and hand made natural leather conditioner.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{activities}} included weaving, baking, and <b>saddlery</b> by {{the single}} brethren; an inn (which was closed in 1848 because of drunkenness and reopened as a hostel in 1861); and a farm, a laundry and needlework shop by the single sisters. The settlement maintained and operated a fire engine. Later activities included brickmaking and cotton carding and spinning.|$|E
25|$|From {{the first}} days of {{colonisation}} horses and bullocks provided the pulling power for wagons, drays, coaches, cabs, vans, traps, gigs and carts of all dimensions. This gave rise to stable, blacksmith, farrier and <b>saddlery</b> businesses in the Papanui area. Hitching posts and water troughs were common place especially at 'watering holes' like the Papanui Hotel.|$|E
25|$|Robert the Devil went to stud with a {{valuation}} of £9,000 and stood ar {{a fee of}} £50. He had limited success at stud. His best runners included Chittabob (Champagne Stakes), El Diablo (Lowther Stakes) and Van Dieman’s Land (third in Epsom Derby). Robert the Devil died in spring 1889 at Beenham stud in Berkshire. After his death, Robert the Devil was stuffed and is still on display at Gibson's <b>saddlery</b> in Newmarket.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} horses {{killed in the}} war was at the time {{unprecedented}} in modern warfare. For example, in the Relief of Kimberley, French's cavalry rode 500 horses to their deaths in a single day. The wastage was particularly heavy among British forces for several reasons: overloading of horses with unnecessary equipment and <b>saddlery,</b> failure to rest and acclimatise horses after long sea voyages and, later in the war, poor management by inexperienced mounted troops and distant control by unsympathetic staffs. The average life expectancy of a British horse, from the time of its arrival in Port Elizabeth, was around six weeks.|$|E
25|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Dallas was the leading drug, book, jewelry, and {{wholesale}} liquor market in the Southwestern United States. It also quickly became the center of trade in cotton, grain, and even buffalo. It was the world's leading inland cotton market, and it still led the world in manufacture of <b>saddlery</b> and cotton gin machinery. During the early 20th century, Dallas transformed from an agricultural center to a center of banking, insurance, fashion retailing and other businesses. Founded here were Neiman Marcus and the now-defunct A. Harris and Sanger Brothers ready-to-wear stores. The 14-story Praetorian Building was the first skyscraper west of the Mississippi River and the tallest building in Texas.|$|E
25|$|Limitations of the horse. There {{were serious}} {{limitations}} {{to the spread}} of the horse in warfare however, as opposed to their use for ceremonial purposes. Horse breeding and maintenance was difficult and restricted in many parts of West and Central Africa due to the tsetse fly induced sleeping sickness disease that struck both man and beast; heavy imports were a practical necessity, especially the larger breeds. States like Dagoma in northern Ghana, Nupe and the Yoruba kingdom of Oyo in Nigeria were very dependent on imports of horses, usually financed by the sale of slaves. As in medieval Europe, maintaining cavalry forces was also more expensive, requiring armor, <b>saddlery,</b> stables, trappings, and extra remounts. Disruption of imports on trade routes could reduce the horse supply. The absence of relatively flat terrain also made cavalry more difficult to deploy. The Oyo for example, had relatively little success in thick forested areas during an ineffective invasion of Nigeria in the 17th century. Horses also had to be fed and maintained, a pressing logistical burden for large formations. Indeed, fighting horses in West African states were often kept in stables and fed there, rather than being put out to graze in the open where the tsetse fly might whittle down their numbers. In Oyo, large numbers of slaves were kept to maintain horses, hauling fodder and water to the stables, and accompanying the cavalry forces as support troops. Their introduction thus had a varying impact in many areas, but nevertheless the horse transformed African warfare in significant ways.|$|E
500|$|The 1st Independent Light Horse Troop {{was a small}} mounted unit {{consisting}} of one officer and 20 other ranks. It was raised at Koitaki on 1 April 1942, using the horses from the station there. It was originally engaged in patrolling and locating crashed aircraft around Port Moresby, but on 26 June it {{was assigned to the}} pack transport role on the Kokoda Track. A remount sub section of 6 men [...] impressed mules, horses and pack <b>saddlery</b> from the plantations around Sogeri, and rounded up and broke brumbies from the Bootless Inlet area.|$|E
500|$|The steep descent near Owers' Corner to the Goldie River {{crossing}} at Uberi {{involved a}} steep ascent {{for the animals}} on the return trip.

One prepared the loads, weighing them to ensure that there was [...] on each side. The other five were each under the command of a non-commissioned officer, with 5 other ranks, 3 riding horses and 10 to 12 pack horses or mules. With a call for more supplies to be delivered, the remount unit was recalled, and 29 other ranks were added from the 55th Infantry Battalion in September, bringing the total strength to 1 officer, 81 other ranks, 39 mules and 63 horses, and allowing four more sub sections to be formed. The 1st Independent Light Horse Troop struggled with epidemics of strangles and infectious nasal catarrh among horses imported from Australia, and the <b>saddlery</b> became increasingly worn until 60 new saddles arrived from Australia in September.|$|E
2500|$|Franklin was {{situated}} at {{the eastern end of}} the Santa Fe Trail, which had opened two years earlier. Many of the customers at the saddleshop were trappers and traders, from whom Carson heard stirring tales of the West. Carson found work in the <b>saddlery</b> not to his taste: he once stated [...] "the business did not suit me, and I concluded to leave".|$|E
2500|$|The Replica Museum {{is located}} {{next to the}} Noel Parade Field and depicts the Post at the Magoffinsville site. [...] This five {{building}} museum was authentically constructed with adobe bricks and painted stucco, and includes a sutler store, bunkhouse, blacksmith shop, <b>saddlery</b> and a pottery kiln. [...] The museum depicts the story of Fort Bliss and El Paso from 1848 to 1948 and was dedicated on the 100th anniversary.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the royal}} kurgans near Phanagoria [...] "has a stone {{stairway}} leading down to a rectangular passageway, {{the entrance to the}} burial chamber (3.70 × 3.75 × 4.70m). These two areas are covered by an arch showing remains of painted decoration. The wall frescos imitate encrusted marble. On either side of the entrance to the tomb long stone boxes contain four horse burials along with rich grave gifts; <b>saddlery</b> and harnesses of gold and gilded bronze." [...] Vladimir Blavatsky resumed excavations of Phanagoria in 1936. Among the recent finds is an inscription indicating that a synagogue existed in Phanagoria as early as 51AD. Underwater investigation of the site has revealed multiple fragments of architectural structures.|$|E
2500|$|The Anzac Mounted Division (less the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade still {{attached}} to Barrow's detachment with the 53rd (Welsh) Division near Khuweilfe) received orders to advance to Ameidat on 7 November. They pushed through {{a gap in the}} Ottoman defensive line at Kh. Umm el Bakr. This gap had been created when the defenders closed up towards Tel esh Sheria and Tel el Khuweilfe. They rode to Umm el Ameidat, [...] north west of Tel esh Sheria station on the Beersheba to Junction Station railway without being opposed for the first couple of miles. As the lead brigade, the 1st Light Horse Brigade moved in open formation over the plain they were shelled by Ottoman artillery from the west and north-west. As the 1st Light Horse Brigade approached the station at 11:00, the leading regiment were fired on. Instead of dismounting to the attack, they charged into the place which was captured after a [...] "sharp fight," [...] along with large supply and ammunition depots. At Ameidat they captured 396 prisoners and 27 trucks loaded with ammunition, ordnance stores including arms and <b>saddlery.</b> From their position [...] behind the old Ottoman front line the Anzac Mounted Division was shelled from the Judean Hills on their right and the Ottoman heavy guns firing from Sheria and Atawineh redoubts on the left. These Ottoman guns also fired on the XX and XXI Corps covering the country in shrapnel, smoke and dust.|$|E
2500|$|While {{waiting to}} repair the airplane, the Signal Corps decided to seek a more {{favorable}} climate location for flying during the winter. Foulois was directed to report to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas where he was directed by CSO Allen to [...] "teach yourself to fly." [...] He did so, and at 9:30 a.m. on March 2, 1910, on the Arthur MacArthur parade field made four flights on S.C. No. 1, which included his first solo takeoff, first solo landing, and first crash. Over the next fifteen months, Foulois modified S.C. No. 1's elevators at the instructions in correspondence from Orville Wright, and demonstrated {{the use of the}} Wright B aircraft for aerial mapping, photography, reconnaissance {{and the use of the}} radio while airborne. To end the requirement of using a 60-foot launch rail to take off, he drew up plans for and installed wheels in place of skids, and equipped the S.C. No. 1 with the first seat belt, using a four-foot leather cinch obtained from the cavalry <b>saddlery.</b> As the result of repeated crashes and repairs, many caused by Foulois being [...] "ground shy" [...] (the result of his having no formal training in landing an airplane), S.C. No. 1 became unflyable, and in February 1911 the Army leased a Wright Model B from Robert Collier. Because Foulois was unfamiliar with the type, the Wright Company sent Philip O. Parmalee to instruct.|$|E

60|$|He wrung Dan's hand, {{and then}} started at a canter and kept on at that pace until he reached Richmond. A train with stores was {{starting}} for the south in a few minutes; General Lee's order enabled Vincent to have a horse-box attached at once, and he was soon speeding on his way. He alighted at Burksville Junction, and there purchased some rough clothes for himself and some country-fashioned <b>saddlery</b> for his horse.
