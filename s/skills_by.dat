One of those aspects is education, which is essential especially English education. There are four skills in learning English, they are listening, speaking, reading and writing.

Each dictionary has the advantage and the weakness. In improving the students‟ writing skill, both dictionaries have important role. Because in Indonesia, English is a foreign language, so the dictionary is a second teacher for students besides the English teacher. The aim of this research is to find out the data about the differences between the students‟ writing <b>skill</b> <b>by</b> using bilingual and monolingual dictionaries. The first step in this thesis research based on the theoretical data resources and empirical data resources with 80 students as the research sample. The techniques for collecting the data is used by the writer are observation, interview, and test. The data will be analyzed by using t-test formula. After the data has been analyzed, it has been obtained the mean score of the students‟ writing <b>skill</b> <b>by</b> using bilingual dictionary is 7. 22. It means that the students‟ writing <b>skill</b> <b>by</b> using bilingual dictionary is good. And the mean score of the students‟ writing <b>skill</b> <b>by</b> using monolingual dictionary is 63. 7. It means that the students‟ writing <b>skill</b> <b>by</b> using monolingual dictionary is poor. From the calculation mean scores above by using t-test formula, it has obtained the value of tobserved 3. 74. It is higher than critical value of the ttable with the significance 5...|$|R

5|$|After the {{acquisition}} of Jay Cutler, Hester took on the role as the de facto number one wide receiver. In {{the first game of}} the season, Hester caught seven passes from Cutler for 90 yards, including a 36-yard touchdown reception.

5|$|Like many {{residents}} of the rural areas in central Madagascar at that time, Rakoto's brothers played the sodina, an end-blown tube traditionally made of bamboo or reed with three or six finger holes and a thumb hole down its length. One {{of the oldest and}} most iconic musical instruments in Madagascar, it is believed to have arrived on the island with the earliest settlers from Borneo around 2,000 years ago and remains widespread throughout the central highlands. Young Rakoto began playing the sodina when he was seven years old. He honed his <b>skills</b> <b>by</b> listening to village elders' sodina performances, and three years later the boy formed a small musical group called Ambohijatobe that performed locally at traditional festivities. During this period Rakoto had the opportunity to participate in a community musical competition. His competitors, who performed on accordions and guitars, threw stones at Rakoto when he stepped forward to perform on the sodina. Despite being struck in the face he completed his performance and was awarded first prize. In 1935 he was nominated by the local governor to represent his district in a national musical competition organized by the French colonial authority at Mahamasina stadium in Antananarivo. That same year Rakoto was orphaned at the age of 12, preventing him from further pursuing an education in the interest of earning a livelihood. A Frenchman hired the boy to work as an assistant baker until he came of age. Upon reaching adulthood, Rakoto left the bakery to become a metalworker while continuing to perform on the sodina in musical ensembles.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} {{well-known}} stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's <b>skills</b> <b>by</b> commanding him to train a harem of 180 concubines into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered {{the execution of the}} king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the fault of the officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterwards, both companies, now well aware of the costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly.|$|E
