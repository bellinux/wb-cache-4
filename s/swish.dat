25|$|The declining use of cash in Sweden {{is going}} to be {{reinforced}} cyclically. As more and more businesses find they can have a functional business without accepting cash, the number of businesses refusing to accept cash will increase. That will re-enforce the need for more and more citizens to get the <b>Swish</b> (payment) app which is already used by half the population. Cash machines, which are controlled by a Swedish bank consortium, are being dismantled by the hundreds, especially in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} further {{classify}} {{the extent of}} dysgeusia and clinically measure the sense of taste, gustatory testing may be performed. Gustatory testing is performed either as a whole-mouth procedure or as a regional test. In both techniques, natural or electrical stimuli can be used. In regional testing, 20 to 50 µL of liquid stimulus is presented to the anterior and posterior tongue using a pipette, soaked filter-paper disks, or cotton swabs. In whole mouth testing, small quantities (2-10 mL) of solution are administered, and the patient is asked to <b>swish</b> the solution around in the mouth.|$|E

One of the show's producers knew him from musical theater writing circles, and suggested he audition for the show. On {{the strength of his}} book <b>Swish,</b> and his imminent marriage to his fiance Mike, he and Rose were cast. The show filmed from February through May 2010, including Derfner's legal marriage in Iowa, and aired beginning in December 2010. Derfner has since publicly criticized the show's producers for their editing and manipulation of statements and sentiments, which sometimes ended up on air as the opposite of actual fact.|$|E

Even Mrs. Robert <b>swished,</b> but Mrs. Holt, in a bronze-coloured silk, <b>swished</b> most of all as she entered the library after a brief errand to the housekeeper's room. Mr. Holt was already {{arranging}} his book-marks in the Bible, while Joshua and Robert, in black cutaways that seemed to have the benumbing and paralyzing effect of strait-jackets, wandered aimlessly about the room, as though its walls were the limit of their movements. The children had a subdued and touch-me-not air that reminded Honora of her own youth.|$|R

500|$|The Disney bomb, {{also known}} as the Disney <b>Swish,</b> officially the 4500lb Concrete Piercing/Rocket Assisted bomb was a rocket-assisted bunker buster bomb {{developed}} during the Second World War by the British Royal Navy to penetrate hardened concrete targets, such as submarine pens, which could resist conventional free-fall bombs.

The Disney could penetrate [...] of solid concrete before detonating. The name is attributed to a propaganda film produced by the Walt Disney Studios, that provided the inspiration for the design.|$|E
500|$|West {{announced}} in January 2016 that <b>SWISH</b> {{would be released}} on February 11, and that month released new songs [...] "Real Friends" [...] and a snippet of [...] "No More Parties in L.A." [...] with Kendrick Lamar. This also revived the GOOD Fridays initiative in which Kanye releases new singles every Friday. On January 26, 2016, West revealed he had renamed the album from <b>SWISH</b> to Waves, and also announced the premier of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line at Madison Square Garden. In {{the weeks leading up}} to the album's release, West became embroiled in several Twitter controversies and released several changing iterations of the track list for the new album. Several days ahead of its release, West again changed the title, this time to The Life of Pablo. On February 11, West premiered the album at Madison Square Garden as part of the presentation of his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line. Following the preview, West announced that he would be modifying the track list once more before its release to the public, and further delayed its release to finalize the recording of the track [...] "Waves" [...] at the behest of co-writer Chance the Rapper. He released the album exclusively on Tidal on February 14, 2016 following a performance on SNL. Following its official streaming release, West continued to tinker with mixes of several tracks, describing the work as [...] "a living breathing changing creative expression" [...] and proclaiming the end of the album as a dominant release form. Although a statement by West around Life of Pablos initial release indicated that the album would be a permanent exclusive to Tidal, the album was released through several other competing services starting in April.|$|E

500|$|Welles had {{originally}} wanted the entire film to use high contrast cinematography, resembling engravings of the Middle Ages; only the opening title sequence uses this technique. The film's most famous sequence is the Battle of Shrewsbury; only about 180 extras were available and Welles used editing techniques {{to give the}} appearance of armies of thousands. Welles filmed all of the battle scenes in long takes, but cut the shots into fragments to create the effect that he wanted. It took ten days to shoot the scenes and six weeks to edit what became a six-minute sequence. In filming the sequence, Welles often used hand-held cameras, wide-angle lenses, slow motion and speed up shots, static shots, <b>swish</b> pans and constant rapid movement of the characters to create a kinetic and chaotic atmosphere. Anderegg has said that [...] "in the end, both armies have become one huge, awkward, disintegrating war machine, a grotesque robot whose power source slowly begins to fail and finally comes to a frozen halt. Verbal rhetoric—language itself—seems, for the moment, both irrelevant and obscene." ...|$|E
500|$|On the Smashing Pumpkins album Zeitgeist and {{subsequent}} tour, Chamberlin used a Yamaha Maple Custom Absolute kit with 60 (instead of standard 45) degree bearing edges. His kit {{consisted of two}} snares (5x12 and the main snare, his 5.5x14 [...] "Signature" [...] model – Yamaha SD-2455JC), six toms (12x14, 8x10, 9x13, and an 8x8 above his floor toms which are 16x16 and 16x18), a 16x22 bass drum, four crash cymbals (a 15" [...] thin and three Zildjian A customs – 15", 18", and 19"), an 8" [...] splash cymbal, 15" [...] New Beat hi-hats, a 20" [...] China High, a 22" [...] K Constantinople medium ride, and a 22" [...] riveted <b>swish</b> knocker. He occasionally used a triangle on his kit, mounted above the hi hats. Chamberlin's drumheads are Remo coated Ambassador on snare-side, clear Emperors on tom batters with clear Ambassadors underneath, with a Powerstoke 3 on the bass drum batter. He uses Zildjian cymbals and Vic Firth 5B sticks. His signature snare drum is popular with other drummers – Chad Smith {{has been known to}} use it as a second snare drum.|$|E
500|$|Having {{initially}} {{announced a}} new album entitled So Help Me God slated for a 2014 release, in March 2015 West announced that the album would instead be tentatively called <b>SWISH.</b> Later that month, West was awarded an honorary doctorate by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for his contributions to music, fashion, and popular culture, officially making him an honorary DFA. The next month, West headlined at the Glastonbury Festival in the UK, despite a petition signed by almost 135,000 people against his appearance. Toward {{the end of the}} set, West proclaimed himself: [...] "the greatest living rock star on the planet." [...] Media outlets, including social media sites such as Twitter, were divided on his performance. NME stated, [...] "The decision to book West for the slot has proved controversial since its announcement, and the show itself appeared to polarise both Glastonbury goers and those who tuned in to watch on their TVs." [...] The publication added that [...] "he's letting his music speak for and prove itself." [...] The Guardian said that [...] "his set has a potent ferocity – but there are gaps and stutters, and he cuts a strangely lone figure in front of the vast crowd." [...] In September 2015, West performed 808s & Heartbreak in its entirety two nights in a row to rave reviews at Hollywood Bowl. The performance featured a 60-person orchestra, a live band, guests from the album and 70 plus dancers. In December 2015, West released a song titled [...] "Facts".|$|E

50|$|<b>Swishing</b> {{refers to}} {{swapping}} an item or items of clothing or shoes or an accessory {{with friends or}} acquaintances. Parties must willingly give an item {{to participate in the}} transaction, once they have given an item they are free to choose something of interest from what others have offered. Value does not come into the equation, as swappers do not necessarily get an item of equal value and are free to choose anything that the other person if offering (without having to pay). <b>Swishing</b> is now being more widely practiced throughout the world and has evolved to include other items such as books and furniture. Not only do people hold 'swishing parties' either as a charity event or simply for the enjoyment of it (while recycling and saving money at the same time), but there are several websites where online <b>swishes</b> take place.|$|R

2500|$|The rise of {{post-modernism}} made camp {{a common}} perspective on aesthetics, {{which was not}} identified with any specific group. The attitude was originally a distinctive factor in pre-Stonewall gay male communities, where it was the dominant cultural pattern. It originated from the acceptance of gayness as effeminacy. Two key components of camp were originally feminine performances: <b>swish</b> and drag. With <b>swish</b> featuring extensive use of superlatives, and drag being exaggerated female impersonation, camp became extended to all things [...] "over the top", including women posing as female impersonators (faux queens), as in the exaggerated Hollywood version of Carmen Miranda. It was {{this version of the}} concept that was adopted by literary and art critics and became a part of the conceptual array of 1960s culture. Moe Meyer still defines camp as [...] "queer parody".|$|E

50|$|<b>Swishing</b> (deriving {{from the}} {{dictionary}} definition of 'to rustle, as silk' - {{which in the}} eyes of the <b>Swishing</b> team means 'to rustle from friends') began in 2000 when Lucy Shea, founder of green PR firm Futerra and her colleagues wanted to come up with a way to combine a love of retail shopping without contributing to increased consumption. It has since been imbursed by fashion model Twiggy in Twiggy's frock exchange, and as a result has become one of the most popular ways of swapping clothes.|$|R
2500|$|Pre-Stonewall [...] "closet" [...] culture {{accepted}} homosexuality as effeminate behaviour, {{and thus}} emphasized camp, drag, and <b>swish</b> including {{an interest in}} fashion and decorating. Masculine gay men were marginalised and formed their own communities, such as the leather subculture and Western, and/or wore clothes that were commonly associated with working-class individuals, such as sailor uniforms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{value of}} the {{payments}} between households, companies and authorities in Sweden amounts to about 20,000-kronor annual per capita in cash.

According to Skingsley, [...] "what some consumers, smaller companies and local clubs often see as a problem, is not so much getting hold of cash, but being able to deposit it in a bank account." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some cymbals may be {{considered}} effects in some kits but [...] "basic" [...] in another set of components. A <b>swish</b> cymbal may, for example serve, as the main ride in some styles of music, but in a larger kit, which includes a conventional ride cymbal as well, it may well {{be considered}} an effects cymbal per se. Likewise, Ozone crashes have the same purpose as a standard crash cymbal, but are considered to be effects cymbals due to their rarity, and the holes cut into them, which provide a darker, more resonant attack.|$|E
