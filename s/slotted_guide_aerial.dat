50|$|In use, {{the board}} to be cut {{is placed in the}} box and {{the point at which the}} board is to be cut is lined up with the {{appropriate}} slot in the mitre box wall. A backsaw is the most common kind of saw used for this operation. The cut is started by placing the saw blade in the slot and drawing the saw back and forth. The <b>slot</b> <b>guides</b> the cut all the way through so that the result is a cut that is perpendicular to the face or edge of the board (depending upon the desired orientation of the cut) and at the appropriate angle.

40|$|Introduction Fatigue {{and stress}} crack {{detection}} in metallic structures {{is of utmost}} importance to the in-service inspections of metallic components. Beside the crack detection, the prediction of the crack size leads to a better estimation of the useful life of the metal in service. Currently, there are several prominent nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques for detecting and sizing surface cracks in metals each of which possesses certain limitations and disadvantages, including the potential drop technique, the eddy current technique, and the surface magnetic field measurement technique. In the last decade, {{a great deal of}} attention has been given to the microwave non-destructive testing (MNDT) of materials. Yeh and Zoughi have demonstrated the potential use of MNDT for detection and sizing of surface-breaking cracks in metals [1].

The three pieces of timber that form the mitre box are nailed together, and the top steadying pieces are fixed with smaller panel pins.

5000|$|On 23 September 2014, the U.S. Air Force {{performed}} the first-ever {{drop of a}} precision <b>guided</b> <b>aerial</b> mine, consisting of a Quickstrike mine equipped with a JDAM kit. The Quickstrike is a Mark 80-series general purpose bomb with the fuse replaced with a target detection device (TDD) to detonate it when a ship passes within lethal range, a safe/arm device in the nose, and a parachute-retarder tailkit in the back. Dropping of naval mines has historically been challenging, as the delivery aircraft has to fly low and slow, 500 ft at , making it vulnerable to hostile fire; the first aerial mining mission of Operation Desert Storm resulted {{in the loss of}} an aircraft, and the U.S. has not flown any combat aerial minings since. The Quickstrike-J is a JDAM-equipped 1,000 lb or 2,000 lb version, and the GBU-62B(V-1)/B Quickstrike-ER is a 500 lb or 2,000 lb gliding version based on the JDAM-ER, which has a range of [...] when launched from 35000 ft. Precision airdropping of naval mines is the first advance in aerial mine delivery techniques since World War II and can increase the survivability of delivery aircraft, since instead of making multiple slow passes at low altitude directly over the area an aircraft can release all of their mines in a single pass from a standoff distance and altitude, and increase the mines' effectiveness, since instead of laying a random pattern of mines in a loosely defined area they can be laid directly into harbor mouths, shipping channels, canals, rivers, and inland waterways, reducing the number of mines required and enhancing the possibility of blocking ship transit corridors. Enemy naval ports can also be blockaded, and a defensive minefield quickly planted to protect areas threatened by amphibious assault.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{engineers}} {{will use}} these two terms interchangeably by calling a stoplog a flashboard. This {{is done in}} part because unlike many other types of bulkhead gates that are one continuous unit, both stoplogs and flashboards are modular and can be easily designed to hold back different amounts of water. However, most engineering texts and design firms differentiate between the two structures. Stoplogs are specialized bulkheads that are dropped into premade <b>slots</b> or <b>guides</b> in a channel or control structure, while flashboards are bulkheads that are placed on the crest or top of a channel wall or control structure. Flashboards are sometimes designed to break away under high flow conditions and thus to provide only a temporary diversion. In contrast, stoplogs are intended to be reused, and failure of a stoplog will result in an uncontrolled flow through a gate.|$|R

The application of the LANDSAT data indicates that: (1) computer classification of the various landcover categories provides information for monitoring the progress of surface mining and reclamation operations; (2) successive yearly changes in barren and revegetated areas can be qualitatively assessed for surface mines of 100 acres or more of disrupted area; (3) barren areas consisting of limestone and shale mixtures may be recognized, and revegetated areas {{in various stages of}} growth may be identified against the hilly forest background...|$|R
50|$|The Swordfish also flew a {{high level}} of anti-shipping sorties in the Mediterranean, many {{aircraft}} being based at Malta. <b>Guided</b> by <b>aerial</b> reconnaissance from other RAF units, Swordfish would time their attacks in order to arrive at enemy convoys in the dark to elude German fighters, which were effectively restricted to daytime operations. While there were never more than a total of 27 Swordfish aircraft stationed on the island at a time, the type succeeded in sinking an average of 50,000 tons of enemy shipping per month across a nine-month period. During one record month, 98,000 tons of shipping were reportedly lost to the island's Swordfish-equipped strike force. The recorded Swordfish losses were low, especially in relation to the high sortie rate of the aircraft and {{in light of the fact}} that many aircraft lacked any blind-flying equipment, making night flying even more hazardous.|$|R
