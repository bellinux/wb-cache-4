40|$|Book synopsis: The German novelist, {{poet and}} critic W. G. Sebald (1944 - 2001) has {{in recent years}} {{attracted}} a phenomenal international following for his evocative prose works such as Die Ausgewanderten (The Emigrants), Die Ringe des Saturn (The Rings of Saturn) and Austerlitz, spellbinding elegiac narratives which, through their deliberate blurring of genre boundaries and provocative use of photography, explore questions of Heimat and exile, memory and loss, history and natural history, art and nature. Saturn’s Moons brings together in one volume a wealth of new critical and visual material on Sebald’s life and works, covering the many facets and phases of his literary and academic careers — as teacher, as scholar and critic, as colleague and as collaborator on translation. Lavishly illustrated, the Handbook also contains a number of rediscovered short pieces by W. G. Sebald, hitherto unpublished interviews, a catalogue of his library, and selected poems and tributes, as well as extensive primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>bibliographies,</b> details of audiovisual material and interviews, and a chronology of life and works. Drawing {{on a range of}} original sources from Sebald’s Nachlass — {{the most important part of}} which is now held in the Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach – Saturn’s Moons will be an invaluable sourcebook for future Sebald studies in English and German alike, complementing and augmenting recent critical works on subjects such as history, memory, modernity, reader response and the visual...|$|R

African American women writers have made an enormous contribution to our culture.

Literature by African American women is important for its aesthetic qualities, and it also illuminates the social issues which these authors have confronted. This book conveniently surveys the lives and works of African American women writers. Included are alphabetically arranged entries on more than 150 African American women novelists, poets, playwrights, short fiction writers, autobiographers, essayists, and influential scholars.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} socio-spatial transformations and {{its relation}} to prostitution. It addresses the motivations for this activity to perpetuate throughout historical periods to the present time, even under further liberalization of the society in relation to sex. This paper aims to understand prostitution as an activity that adapts to social change, and that has transformed sex into a commodity {{in the context of a}} capitalist society. It is noted that such relationship is permeated by a variety of economic and social violence that have served as basis of discussions on the topic, such as human trafficking and extreme poverty.   Herewith, prostitution is conceptually considered crime such as human trafficking, sexual exploitation of children and slave labor. The approach taken is that female prostitution, whilst not the only type of prostitution, is the most significant from an economic point of view. The methodology adopted was the use of primary sources (reports, interviews) and <b>secondary</b> (large <b>bibliography</b> on the subject), from the data obtained sought to interpretation based on the geographic method of Milton Santos. Ao se enfocar a prostituição como uma atividade econômica que se adapta às mudanças sócio-econômicas do mundo, são inevitáveis as discussões sobre o que é “trabalho” e o que é “exploração” sexual, e até que ponto o sexo ou os serviços sexuais são considerados ou tratados como mercadoria, e se deve ocorrer o reconhecimento desse “trabalho” com a conseqüente regularização dessa profissão. Este artigo levanta algumas questões que estão no centro das discussões sobre esse tema...|$|R
40|$|Geography is {{the ideal}} {{discipline}} for studying the global tourism industry; as the key journal Tourism Geographies (under Journals) explains, there are many fundamentally geographical aspects to tourism which (1) “occurs in places, (2) is sold and begins {{in a place of}} origin and is consumed in destination places, (3) transforms the environment of visited places in ways that are distinct from non-tourism processes, (4) involves the movement of people, goods, services, ideas, and money over space, and (5) presents a distinct way that people view, understand and relate to the world. ” Given the inherently spatial aspects of tourism, geographers have contributed significantly to academic tourism studies. They have developed {{some of the most important}} conceptual models for explaining tourism development, including resort morphology, the tourist-historic city, and the tourist area life cycle. Additionally geographers have made the most sustained contributions to the study of the environmental dimensions of tourism and have been major contributors to the concepts of sustainable tourism and Ecotourism. Even though it has been at the core of tourism studies and also strengthened geography department enrollments, tourism geography ironically has been somewhat peripheral in academic geography. This status may be due in part to the inertia of academic institutions and staff in not seeing tourism as a serious subject for study, as well as the difficulty in measuring the tourism industry as compared to primary and <b>secondary</b> industries.

[...] Dept. of Art and Art History. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2014 In {{their efforts to}} understand the history of manga, or Japanese comics, scholars have struggled determining the timeline of this art form. While some historians begin their narrative {{as far back as}} the twelfth century with examples of art that might be classified as "pre-manga," some academics choose to cite the start point manga's timeline in the nineteenth century with the first usage of the term "manga. " Others researchers are even more conservative, beginning their scope of manga's history with the techniques developed during the mid-twentieth century which yield artwork recognizable to today's aesthetics. The study of manga is still in an embryonic state, and the scope of this genre of art is vast; these two factors create a challenge in establishing a timeline for manga' history. Although it would be convenient to consider the history of Japanese illustrative art as a timeline that leads directly to modern manga, the myriad of genres and styles complicate the researcher's ability to make claims about the pertinence of any specific point on that timeline to the development of manga as it is known today. The most poignant example of this is ukiyo-e, or nineteenth-century Japanese woodblock print art. Speaking of manga as a whole, it is impossible to reconcile the exact role of ukiyo-e as a parent (or if not father, perhaps an uncle of sorts) to today's manga. At present, the state of the scholarly literature on this remains noncommittal, refusing to admit fully or deny completely whether or not manga owes its history to the woodblock print art of nineteenth-century Edo. The objective of this research is to open the discussion about the roles the ukiyo-e played in the development of modern manga. This may be achieved through the study of the works of one mangaka, or artist-author of manga, Rumiko Takahashi (1957 [...] ). Through studying Takahashi's work, one may recognize the ways in which ukiyo-e was essential to manga's development. There are elements of Takahashi's work that could not exist if it were not for the influence and developments that source from nineteenth-century woodblock prints. Through the microscope of the work of one prolific and popular mangaka, it is possible to initiate a discussion of ukiyo-eâ€™s participation in manga's timeline. And perhaps art historians may broaden the acceptance of these concepts to apply to manga as a wholeCollege of Arts and SciencesAbstract [...] List of images [...] Acknowledgments [...] Introduction - Manga and Ukiyo-e discussed - Ukiyo-e's place in Manga's development [...] Ukiyo-e's relationship to modern Mange [...] Conclusion [...] Images [...] Glossary of terms [...] <b>Secondary</b> source <b>bibliography</b> [...] Primary source bibliographymonographi...|$|R
