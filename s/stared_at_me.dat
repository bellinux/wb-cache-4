That is, while you can sign 'dog chew bone' for the dog chewed on a bone, or 'she look-at me' for she looked at me, you cannot {{do the same in}} the durative to mean the dog gnawed on the bone or she <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Instead, you must use other strategies, such as a topic construction (see below) to avoid having an object for the verb.|$|E

Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: [...] "I was jet-propelled out of the closet.

[...] She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised, once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student. She said of the rediscovery, [...] "I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life. It had seemed to me, up to that point, that not only had the books and the characters died, so had Ann Bannon." [...] However, following a bitter divorce, and just as the Naiad Press editions of her books were released, Bannon endured a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, which she connects to repressing herself for so long.
