50|$|The PCD {{continued}} {{to expand its}} activities in central Queensland {{in the second half}} of the 1930s. In 1937 a dairy factory and buttermilk <b>stud</b> <b>stock</b> piggery (carrying capacity 500 pigs) were opened at Biloela in the Callide Valley. Another PCD buttermilk <b>stud</b> <b>stock</b> piggery, with a carrying capacity of 700 pigs, was opened at Monto in February 1938. In November 1938 the PCD installed a plant at the Gladstone factory for the re-tinning of cream cans, which proved popular with farmers.|$|E
50|$|The Townsville Showground {{incorporates}} {{elements that}} are aesthetically significant including the Tunbridge & Tunbridge grandstand (1901), interwar amenities blocks, Heatley Hall (1939, the <b>Stud</b> <b>Stock</b> pavilions (c.1890s), entrance gates, ticket boxes, Curley Bell stands (1920-30s), poultry pavilion, show ring and mature Banyan trees.|$|E
50|$|Pigs are {{exhibited}} at agricultural shows, judged either as <b>stud</b> <b>stock</b> {{compared to the}} standard features of each pig breed, or in commercial classes where the animals are judged primarily on their suitability for slaughter to provide premium meat. According to The Livestock Conservancy, as of 2016, three breeds of pigs are critically rare (having a global population of fewer than 2000). They are the Choctaw, the Mulefoot, and the Ossabaw Island pig.|$|E
50|$|In late 1977, David Templeton and {{two other}} former {{partners}} of Gold Creek Pty Ltd bought the Red Hill Hereford Stud, a cattle breeding business located near Finley in southern NSW. Established in 1966, Red Hill <b>Stud's</b> breeding <b>stock</b> was top notch. Initially the partners transported their prize bulls to Gold Creek {{to prepare them for}} show and eventual sale. The Red Hill Hereford Stud won a swag of blue ribbons at Agricultural Shows in Canberra, Sydney and regional NSW. Its success led to a series of cattle breeders’ field days at Gold Creek held in conjunction with the Australian Hereford Society that attracted society members from around Australia.|$|R
50|$|From the 20th century equid hybrids {{were being}} created. The first {{crossbreeding}} was with zebras and donkeys. Equid hybrids {{can be traced}} back to Africa where there are vast amount of equid species which resulted in natural crossing creating hybrid species. These hybrids were found to be more efficient than the original species because they poses certain traits of both species so scientists began to experiment by crossing other species of the horse family and categorizing them as Equid Hybrids. Equid hybrids are now bred commercially. Mules bred from mammoth <b>studs</b> and <b>stock</b> or draft mares can be as large as seventeen hands and are as strong as a normal horse. Other mules are bred for pets or for entertainment such as zoo, these are the miniature horses or miniature donkeys.|$|R
50|$|On May 13-14, six top <b>stud</b> bulls of <b>stock</b> raising {{industry}} in Miyazaki were evacuated to the Ohae farm vacant lot in Nishio shi (within the FMD control zone), 24 kilometers {{away from the}} Miyazaki Livestock Improvement Association. The bulls’ names are Fukunokuni, Katsuhiramasa, Tadafuji, Hidekikuyasu, Mihonokuni, and Yasusigemori. The Association manages breeding of 55 seed bulls and the six prized bulls accounted for 90% of artificial breeding in the prefecture. The evacuation was carried out within the movement control zone as an exceptional measure endorsed by the central government, after a report of another case of FMD (found on 12 May 2010) in Kawaminami which is 2 kilometers away from the Association in Takanabe town. Originally they had been expected to move 40 kilometers to Nishimerason, but ended up moving 60 kilometers with an overnight camp {{to be away from}} a livestock breeding farm located near Nishimerason. Tadafuji, later found FMD positive, was one of the six bulls. Report dated 22 May 2010 says the bull had been showing the symptom of excessive saliva during the move and there was the possibility that Tadafuji may have spread the virus to the surroundings including five other top seed bulls.|$|R
50|$|Many more {{staff were}} {{required}} at Glengallan, even though shepherding was abandoned {{in favour of}} fenced paddocks, and sheep washing ceased in the 1870s. Glengallan concentrated on stud sheep and cattle, with fat lambs becoming important once rail transport and refrigeration came into the economic realm. One of Slade's achievements was to transform Glengallan from a traditional pastoral stud property to one where intensive cultivation of lucerne and other fodder supported not only the <b>stud</b> <b>stock</b> but also wethers bought for fattening from western properties, and he was praised by contemporaries as the best manager in the Darling Downs. Further diversification included dairying and a substantial piggery.|$|E
50|$|In 1845, Christian Sauerbier, from Germany, {{purchased}} land {{south of}} Adelaide, near Happy Valley. In 1856, Sauerbier owned eleven sections {{of land in}} the area. The area became agricultural and the Sauerbier family was renowned for the quality of their <b>stud</b> <b>stock</b> and the orange grove that was attached to their property. Christian Sauerbier died in 1893 and the property was given to his son, John Chris. During the First World War, when anti-German sentiment was at a high in Australia, Chris changed his last name to Aberfoyle - a reference to an area in Perthshire, Scotland where his father had lived for a while. John Chris died in 1923 and his estate was subdivided and sold by James Henry Browne.|$|E
50|$|The Deed of Grant for {{the land}} on which the Exchange Building was to be {{constructed}} was issued to William Handcock on 11 May 1854. Title to the property was transferred to Thomas George Robinson in April 1877. T. G. Robinson arrived in Toowoomba in 1859. He {{established himself as a}} stock and land salesman in 1860 under the firm name of T. G. Robinson and Co. He was elected as a local alderman at a by-election in 1864 and served as Mayor of Toowoomba in 1865, but did not seek re-election. T. G. Robinson was connected with various progressive movements for advancement of the town and was instrumental in introducing <b>stud</b> <b>stock</b> to the town. T. G. Robinson's son, William Richard, was also involved with his father's business, taking over as sole proprietor following his father's death.|$|E
50|$|The {{homestead}} {{was built}} in 1867-68 by John Deuchar who, with partner Charles Henry Marshall, established the famous Glengallan Merino flock and Shorthorn stud. The breeding tradition established by Deuchar was further developed by William Ball Slade who maintained the pre-eminence of the Glengallan stud from 1873 until the property was sold in 1904. Slade also transformed Glengallan from a traditional pastoral stud property to one where intensive cultivation of lucerne and other fodder supported not only the <b>stud</b> <b>stock</b> but also wethers bought for fattening from western properties. Further diversification included dairying and a substantial piggery, and Slade was praised by his contemporaries as the best manager on the Darling Downs. Slade was also described as the archetypal Anglo-Australian patrician of Warwick, being a patron, office-bearer, benefactor and member of numerous societies, clubs, the Masonic Lodge and Anglican Church.|$|E
5000|$|Profits from {{pastoralism}} {{were also}} used by Jondaryan's owners to improve the homestead site and station records indicate significant building activities were being carried on during the early 1860s. In 1860, the main residence was renovated, perhaps in anticipation of Governor Bowen's visit the following year, and quarters for the station's shearers were erected. A new butcher's shop, store, hides and tallow house, stables and St Anne's Anglican Church were erected around this time, and the Jondaryan Woolshed, was also completed during the early 1860s. As a homestead complex, Jondaryan had reached a state of completion during the 1860s, which was reflected upon in The Queenslander in 1922: [...] "cottages for employees, stables and enclosures for <b>stud</b> <b>stock,</b> and other buildings make quite a little township of themselves, {{and add to the}} completeness of the station". For an earlier visitor to the site, who is quoted in Jondaryan Woolshed (1998), the head station [...] "was a very comfortable residence, very similar to the country gentlemen's house in England, except that it was all on one floor with a verandah all round and built of wood, and therefore covered a considerable extent of ground. It was surrounded by a vineyard, a garden full of flowers and fruit and vegetables, with a nice stream of water flowing past the front garden, where one could indulge in the luxury of a swim".|$|E
50|$|The {{first show}} {{was held at}} the new {{showground}} in 1882, and it was quickly realised by the P & A Association {{at the time that the}} area was an insufficient to service the showground events with no dedicated show exhibition space or to provide a flexible sporting venue for the growing community. As a result, the showgrounds were expanded in 1888 to take in the Manure Depot and the Pound Reserve covering a total area of over 30 acres (12.14 ha).From the beginning the Townsville showground precinct was a venue where the community could meet, showcase its pastoral and agricultural produce; introduce new agricultural ideas and technology; and provide a much anticipated meeting place for the community to gather, meet relatives, and socialise. Prominent North Queensland pastoralists and agriculturalists used the venue to showcase their horses, promote their interest in breeding stock and encourage future growth in the region. In addition to <b>stud</b> <b>stock,</b> exhibitions reflected the major influence of wool, timber reserves, coffee, horticulture and minerals indicative of the pastoral, agricultural, and mining industries throughout the region. It also provided an outlet where the products of women's labour associated within the domestic environment were exhibited including displays of cookery, needlework, millinery, arts and taxonomy. In addition children were encouraged to enter events which displayed their prowess in the execution of schoolwork. Events attracted both professional and amateur participants and contributors travelled from west beyond Hughenden to take advantage of the opportunity to restock provisions, network and get together. Between Shows sporting groups took advantage of the broad even grounds with the Townsville Rugby Football Club playing regular games from July 1889.|$|E

40|$|The Lanyu is a {{miniature}} pig breed indigenous to Lanyu Island, Taiwan. It is distantly related to Asian and European pig breeds. It has been inbred to generate two breeds and crossed with Landrace and Duroc to produce two hybrids for laboratory use. Selecting sets of informative genetic markers {{to track the}} genetic qualities of laboratory animals and <b>stud</b> <b>stock</b> is an important function of genetic databases. For more than two decades, Lanyu derived breeds of common ancestry and crossbreeds {{have been used to}} examine the effectiveness of genetic marker selection and optimal approaches for individual assignment. In this paper, these pigs and the following breeds: Berkshire, Duroc, Landrace and Yorkshire, Meishan and Taoyuan, TLRI Black Pig No. 1, and Kaohsiung Animal Propagation Station Black pig are studied to build a genetic reference database. Nineteen microsatellite markers (loci) provide information on genetic variation and differentiation among studied breeds. High differentiation index (FST) and Cavalli-Sforza chord distances give genetic differentiation among breeds, including Lanyu’s inbred populations. Inbreeding values (FIS) show that Lanyu and its derived inbred breeds have significant loss of heterozygosity. Individual assignment testing of 352 animals was done with different numbers of microsatellite markers in this study. The testing assigned 99 % of the animals successfully into their correct reference populations based on 9 to 14 markers ranking D-scores, allelic number, expected heterozygosity (HE) or FST, respectively. All miss-assigned individuals came from close lineage Lanyu breeds. To improve individual assignment among close lineage breeds, microsatellite markers selected from Lanyu populations with high polymorphic, heterozygosity, FST and D-scores were used. Only 6 to 8 markers ranking HE, FST or allelic number were required to obtain 99 % assignment accuracy. This result suggests empirical examination of assignment-error rates is required if discernible levels of co-ancestry exist. In the reference group, optimum assignment accuracy was achievable achieved through a combination of different markers by ranking the heterozygosity, FST and allelic number of close lineage populations...|$|E
