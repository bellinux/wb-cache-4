30|$|The {{parameters}} of conductance-based models are typically fit to voltage-clamp recordings. In these experiments, individual ionic currents are isolated using pharmacological blockers and one measures current traces {{in response to}} voltage pulses. However, many electrophysiological datasets consist of current-clamp rather than voltage-clamp recordings. In current-clamp, one records a voltage trace (e.g., a series of action potentials) in response to injected current. Fitting a conductance-based model to current-clamp data is challenging because the individual ionic currents have not been measured directly. In terms of the Hodgkin–Huxley model, only one <b>state</b> <b>variable</b> (<b>V)</b> has been observed, {{and the other three}} <b>state</b> <b>variables</b> (m, h, and n) are unobserved. Conductance-based models of neurons often contain several ionic currents and, therefore, more unobserved gating variables and more unknown or poorly known parameters. For example, a model of HVC neurons in the zebra finch has 9 ionic currents, 12 <b>state</b> <b>variables,</b> and 72 parameters [2]. An additional difficulty in attempting to fit a model to a voltage trace is that if one performs a least-squares minimization between the data and model output, then small differences in the timing of action potentials in the data and the model can result in large error [3]. Data assimilation methods have the potential to overcome these challenges by performing state estimation (of both observed and unobserved states) and parameter estimation simultaneously.|$|R

40|$|The Hamiltonian for the {{oscillator}} has earlier {{been written}} in the form H=ℏω(2 v+v+λ+·λ+ 3 / 2), where v+ and v are raising and lowering operators for v+v, which has eigenvalues k (the "radial" quantum number), and λ+ and λ are raising and lowering 3 -vector operators for λ+·λ, which has eigenvalues l (the total angular momentum quantum number). A new set of coherent states for the oscillator is now denned by diagonalizing v and λ. These states bear a similar relation to the commuting operators H, L 2, and L 3 (where L is the angular momentum of the system) as the usual coherent states do to the commuting number operators N 1, N 2, and N 3. It is proposed to call them coherent angular momentum states. They are shown to be minimum-uncertainty <b>states</b> for the <b>variables</b> <b>v,</b> v +λ, and λ+ {{and to provide a}} new quasiclassical description of the oscillator. This description coincides with that provided by the usual coherent states only in the special case that the corresponding classical motion is circular, rather than elliptical; and, in general, the uncertainty in the angular momentum of the system is smaller in the new description. The probabilities of obtaining particular values for k and l in one of the new states follow independent Poisson distributions. The new states are overcomplete, and lead to a new representation of the Hilbert space for the oscillator, in terms of analytic functions on C×K 3, where K 3 is the three-dimensional complex cone. This space is related to one introduced recently by Bargmann and Todorov, and carries a very simple realization of all the representations of the rotation group...|$|R

30|$|What {{makes the}} {{mobilization}} by migrants {{different from other}} forms of ethnic mobilization is that migrants can be politically involved in both the sending and the receiving country. Increasingly, globalization allows migrants to form transnational communities and share multiple identities (Castles, 2002). Receiving countries often promote these transnational bonds {{with the goal of}} stimulating remittances from the expatriates (Portes and Rumbaut, 2006). This implies that migrants remain connected to their <b>sending</b> <b>state</b> and are therefore also expected to mobilize in the case of political conflict in their country of emigration. In fact, many migrants leave for political reasons such as war or discrimination in the <b>sending</b> <b>state.</b> In the context of a globalized world, in which migrants can easily remain informed about the political situation in the <b>sending</b> <b>state</b> and might even be in continuous contact with family members that remained there, opposition to the government in the <b>sending</b> <b>state</b> is a strong source of motivation.

30|$|The {{cross-sectional}} analysis also {{allows us to}} test whether the result that migrant protest is strongly conditioned by war or discrimination in the <b>sending</b> <b>state</b> is dependent upon latter’s operationalization. 11 Hence, in addition to measure war or discrimination in the <b>sending</b> <b>state</b> {{with the number of}} asylum seekers we make use of information on the political situation in the <b>sending</b> <b>state.</b> We make use of Polity IV scores in order to measure whether the <b>sending</b> <b>state</b> was an autocracy or not. The Polity IV project measures political regime characteristics on a global scale and over time (Marshall and Jaggers, 2002). We make use of the Polity 2 index, where a negative score indicates that the country was an autocracy. A major weakness of the Polity IV score {{is that it does not}} sufficiently take into account that specific minorities might be discriminated even if the regime as a whole cannot be considered an autocracy. Hence, we also code states as being at war or discriminating a share of its population if they are engaged in an ethnic war. 12 We take this information from the Ethnic War Dataset (Cederman, Wimmer, and Min, 2010). Our resulting indicator is positively correlated with the share of asylum seekers (R[*]=[*] 0.26; Pr[*]=[*] 0.00; N[*]=[*] 288)—our original measure for war or discrimination in the <b>sending</b> <b>state.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{suitable}} {{relationship that}} defines non-equilibrium thermodynamic <b>state</b> <b>variables</b> is as follows.

In general, non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems are spatially and temporally non-uniform, but their non-uniformity still has a sufficient degree of smoothness to support the existence of suitable time and space derivatives of non-equilibrium <b>state</b> <b>variables.</b> Because of the spatial non-uniformity, non-equilibrium <b>state</b> <b>variables</b> that correspond to extensive thermodynamic <b>state</b> <b>variables</b> have to be defined as spatial densities of the corresponding extensive equilibrium <b>state</b> <b>variables.</b> On occasions when the system is sufficiently close to thermodynamic equilibrium, intensive non-equilibrium <b>state</b> <b>variables,</b> for example temperature and pressure, correspond closely with equilibrium <b>state</b> <b>variables.</b> It is necessary that measuring probes be small enough, and rapidly enough responding, to capture relevant non-uniformity. Further, the non-equilibrium <b>state</b> <b>variables</b> are required to be mathematically functionally related to one another in ways that suitably resemble corresponding relations between equilibrium thermodynamic <b>state</b> <b>variables.</b> In reality, these requirements are very demanding, and it may be difficult or practically, or even theoretically, impossible to satisfy them.
