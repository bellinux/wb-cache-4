40|$|DINIES (drug–target {{interaction}} network {{inference engine}} based on supervised analysis) is a web server for predicting unknown drug–target interaction net-works from {{various types of}} biological data (e. g. chemical structures, drug side effects, amino acid sequences and protein domains) {{in the framework of}} <b>supervised</b> <b>network</b> inference. The originality of DINIES lies in prediction with state-of-the-art ma-chine learning methods, in the integration of het-erogeneous biological data and in compatibility with the KEGG database. The DINIES server accepts any ‘profiles ’ or precalculated similarity matrices (or ‘ker-nels’) of drugs and target proteins in tab-delimited file format. When a training data set is submitted to learn a predictive model, users can select either known interaction information in the KEGG DRUG database or their own interaction data. The user can also select an algorithm for <b>supervised</b> <b>network</b> in-ference, select various parameters in the method and specify weights for heterogeneous data inte-gration. The server can provide integrative analyses with useful components in KEGG, such as biological pathways, functional hierarchy and human diseases. DINIE...|$|E

Because of the effort, the cost, {{or the lack of}} the experiments necessary to the elucidation of these networks, computational approaches for network inference have been frequently investigated in the literature. In this thesis, we focus on <b>supervised</b> <b>network</b> inference methods. These methods exploit supervised machine learning algorithms to train a model for identifying new interacting pairs of nodes from a training sample of known interacting and possibly non-interacting pairs and additional measurement data about the network nodes. Our contributions in this area are divided into three parts. First, the thesis examines the problem of the assessment of <b>supervised</b> <b>network</b> inference methods. Indeed, their reliable validation (in silico) poses a number of new challenges with respect to standard classification problems, related to the fact that pairs of objects are to be classified and to the specificities of biological networks. We perform a critical review and assessment of protocols and measures proposed in the literature. Through theoretical considerations and in silico experiments, we analyze in depth how important factors influence the outcome of performance estimation.

40|$|Abstract:- It is {{generally}} accepted that most benchmark problems known today {{can be solved}} by artificial neural networks with one single hidden layer. Networks {{with more than one}} hidden layer normally slow down learning dramatically. Furthermore, generalisation to new input patterns {{is generally}} better in small networks [1, 2]. However, most benchmark problems only involve a small training data set which is normally discrete (such as binary values 0 and 1) in nature. The ability of single hidden layer <b>supervised</b> <b>networks</b> to solve problems with large and continuous type of data (e. g. most engineering problems) is virtually unknown. A fast learning method for solving continuous type problems has been proposed by Evans et al. [3]. However, the method is based on the Kohonen competitive, and ART unsupervised network models. In addition, almost every benchmark problem has the training set containing all possible input patterns, so there is no study of the generalisation behaviour of the network [4]. This study attempts to show that single hidden layer <b>supervised</b> <b>networks</b> can be used to solve large and continuous type problems within measurable algorithmic complexities...|$|R

40|$|Determining {{the best}} method for {{training}} a machine learning algorithm is critical to maximizing its ability to classify data. In this paper, we compare the standard "fully supervised" approach (that relies on knowledge of event-by-event truth-level labels) with a recent proposal that instead utilizes class ratios as the only discriminating information provided during training. This so-called "weakly supervised" technique has access to less information than the fully supervised method and yet is still able to yield impressive discriminating power. In addition, weak supervision seems particularly well suited to particle physics since quantum mechanics is incompatible {{with the notion of}} mapping an individual event onto any single Feynman diagram. We examine the technique in detail [...] both analytically and numerically [...] with a focus on the robustness to issues of mischaracterizing the training samples. Weakly <b>supervised</b> <b>networks</b> turn out to be remarkably insensitive to systematic mismodeling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the event level outputs for weakly versus fully <b>supervised</b> <b>networks</b> are probing different kinematics, even though the numerical quality metrics are essentially identical. This implies that {{it should be possible to}} improve the overall classification ability by combining the output from the two types of networks. For concreteness, we apply this technology to a signature of beyond the Standard Model physics to demonstrate that all these impressive features continue to hold in a scenario of relevance to the LHC.
