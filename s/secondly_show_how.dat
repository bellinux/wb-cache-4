40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis are twofold: firstly, {{demonstrate that the}} string of contradictions stretching across substantive and procedural corporate criminal law may be avoided if courts refer to an appropriate mechanism of imputation; and <b>secondly,</b> <b>show</b> <b>how</b> such an appropriate mechanism of imputation may be determined. This study adopts a three-step process to achieve these objectives. The first step involves elaborating {{on the lack of}} coherence and integrity in the imputation of acts and intents (or causal relationships) to corporations caused by a disjunction of rules invoked by courts. The second step involves establishing parameters by which mechanisms of imputation may be evaluated. The third step involves evaluating a number of samples by reference to the established parameters. Five mechanisms of imputation applicable in the United Kingdom and in some jurisdictions that trace their legal heritage to the United Kingdom are evaluated. In the conclusion, it is submitted that although none of the mechanisms evaluated may be deemed to be the appropriate mechanism, the aggregation doctrine is the least inappropriate. This is because although it requires some modification, it can best be aligned with propositions of how the criminal liability of corporations may be established on a coherent and consistent basis. The propositions that are put forward include the use of the doctrine of innocent agency to establish a corporation’s guilt in instances where no guilty agent may be identified; {{and the use of the}} principle of accessorial liability to establish a corporation’s guilt in instances where a guilty agent may be identified. The aggregation doctrine as modified in this study will enable the prosecutor to establish a corporation’s guilt as advised above if measurable values are given to the ‘innocent’ acts of agents and if emphasis is placed on how the corporation reacted to the discursive dilemma that arose in the decision-making process that preceded the performance of the relevant activity. This will provide evidence to the effect that the aggregated act represents the corporation’s subjective position. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

However, the influence ofAsian thought upon environmental philosophy seems to be very limited, or remains superficial. Concepts and theories in this field are almost all Western, while genuine Asian concepts and theories hardly appear outside studies about particular Asian cases. This paper compares the modern, Western, environmental mind and the natural thought found in Japanese culture. Through this comparison, we see the characteristics ofboth more clearly, in terms ofadvantages and limitations.

40|$|This {{technical}} report details the {{research into the}} design of RHODOS' paging mechanism. RHODOS' main design philosophy is both {{the building of a}} high performance modern distributed operating system and the comparison and testing of new and competing strategies and theories in distributed operating systems. Due to this design philosophy the paging facility must be flexible. In fact, the paging facility must be capable of supporting process migration and distributed shared memory as well as being able to allow different paging policies to be implemented. This report firstly covers the additions/modifications required to RHODOS' existing space management functions; and <b>secondly,</b> <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> these additions/modifications are utilised in both the policy and mechanism of paging in RHODOS. 1 Introduction When a computer's core memory is (nearly) all used, then no other memory can be allocated to an existing or new process.
