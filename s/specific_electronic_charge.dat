An apparatus {{designed to measure}} the <b>specific</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>charge</b> for a free electron is described. A well collimated electron beam traverses axially a right circular cylindrical resonant cavity, which is operated so that the principal field interaction {{is due to a}} transverse, uniform, rotating magnetic field extending the length of the cavity. The cavity serves as a velocity selector so that the electron beam is undeflected, when it remains within the cavity an integral number of field cycles. The determination of [ [...] . ] depends upon precise measurements of a length, a frequency, and a voltage. The holes, which provide the electron beam with access to the cavity, cause field distortion. The correction for this distortion is obtained empirically. The experimental results obtained with this apparatus are stated. The failure to secure a significant determination of [ [...] . ] is considered. The feasibility of a precise determination of [ [...] . ] by the described method with certain important design changes is asserted...|$|E
40|$|The {{competition}} between intra molecular charge redistribution and fragmentation {{has been studied}} in small molecules containing iodine by using intense ultrashort pulses in the extreme ultraviolet regime (XUV). We show that after an element specific inner-shell photoionization of diiodomethane (CH$_ 2 $I$_ 2 $) and iodomethane (CH$_ 3 $I), the induced positive charge is redistributed with a significantly different efficiency. Therefore, we analyze ion time-of-flight data obtained from XUV-pump XUV-probe experiments at the Free Electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH). Theoretical considerations {{on the basis of}} ab initio electronic structure calculations including correlations relate this effect to a strongly molecule <b>specific,</b> purely <b>electronic</b> <b>charge</b> redistribution process that takes place directly after photoionization causing a distribution of the induced positive charge predominantly on the atoms which exhibit the lowest atomic ionization potential, i. e, in the molecules considered, the iodine atom(s). As a result of the very different initial charge distributions, the fragmentation timescales of the two molecules experimentally observed are strikingly different...|$|R

5000|$|OECTs are {{different}} from electrolyte-gated field-effect transistors. In the latter type of device, ions do not penetrate into the channel, but rather accumulate near its surface (or near {{the surface of a}} dielectric layer, when such a layer is deposited on the channel). [...] This induces accumulation of <b>electronic</b> <b>charge</b> inside the channel, near the surface. In contrast, in OECTs, ions are injected into the channel and change the <b>electronic</b> <b>charge</b> density throughout its entire volume. As a result of this bulk coupling between ionic and <b>electronic</b> <b>charge,</b> OECTs show a very high transconductance. The disadvantage of OECTs is that they are slow, as ionic charge has {{to get in and out}} of the channel. Microfabricated OECTs show response times of the order of hundreds of microseconds.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of external electric field (EF) in the adsorption of atomic hydrogen on graphene (H/G) was studied {{by means of}} electronic structure calculations based on spin-polarized density functional theory with generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The changes in atomic hydrogen physisorption-chemisorption on graphene owed to EF (which ranged between − 1. 25 [*]V/Å and 0. 75 [*]V/Å) were determined. Analysis of the <b>electronic</b> <b>charge</b> density for an H/G system explained the EF influences on the adsorption properties (analyzing changes in <b>electronic</b> <b>charge</b> density for H/G system). A decrease of more than 100 % in the chemisorption barrier for an EF of − 1. 25 [*]V/Å was found.

40|$|Voltage-dependent gating {{behavior}} of Shaker potassium channels without N-type inactivation (ShB delta 6 - 46) expressed in Xenopus oocytes was studied. The voltage {{dependence of the}} steady-state open probability indicated that the activation process involves {{the movement of the}} equivalent of 12 - 16 <b>electronic</b> <b>charges</b> across the membrane. The sigmoidal kinetics of the activation process, which is maintained at depolarized voltages up to at least + 100 mV indicate the presence of at least five sequential conformational changes before opening. The voltage dependence of the gating charge movement suggested that each elementary transition involves 3. 5 <b>electronic</b> <b>charges.</b> The voltage dependence of the forward opening rate, as estimated by the single- channel first latency distribution, the final phase of the macroscopic ionic current activation, the ionic current reactivation and the ON gating current time course, showed movement of the equivalent of 0. 3 to 0. 5 <b>electronic</b> <b>charges</b> were associated with a large number of the activation transitions. The equivalent charge movement of 1. 1 <b>electronic</b> <b>charges</b> was associated with the closing conformational change. The results were generally consistent with models involving a number of independent and identical transitions with a major exception that the first closing transition is slower than expected as indicated by tail current and OFF gating charge measurements...|$|R

The mechanism of <b>electronic</b> <b>charging</b> of coal mine dust was investigated in this paper. It was found that the formation and polarity of dust are determined by the energy band structure and of the two contacting sides; then a mathematical model of work function is established in mesoscopic level. The experiments conclude that the work function decreases with the particle size for the dust with same properties, moreover large particles are positively charged and small particles are negatively charged. Finally, the experimental verification of the main particles charged model drive unipolar and bipolar charged modes and confirm the correctness of microstructure and mesoscopic analyses, which furthermore lay the foundation for further research. </p...|$|R
