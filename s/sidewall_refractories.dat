The {{widely used}} Si 3 N 4 -SiC <b>sidewall</b> <b>refractories</b> for {{aluminum}} smelting cells, and β SiAlON-SiC composites {{that can be}} potentially used for this purpose, have been produced by reaction bonding and their corrosion performance assessed in simulated aluminum electrochemical cell conditions. The formation of the Si 3 N 4 and SiAlON phases were studied by reaction bonding of silicon powders {{in a nitrogen atmosphere}} at low temperatures to promote the formation of silicon nitride, followed by a higher heating step to produce β SiAlON composites of different composition. The corrosion performance was studied in a laboratory scale aluminum electrolysis cell where samples were exposed to both liquid attack from molten salt bath and corrosive gas attack. The corrosion resistance of the samples was shown to be dependent on the composition but more importantly on the environment during corrosion, with samples in the gas phase showing higher corrosion...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{a study of}} the {{influence}} of the glass melt on durability of the refractories used as lining in a furnace of the Greek flat glass industry is presented. Exact compounds formed formed especially in the lining as well as the maximum depth are observed and determined. This study shows that after five years' continuous running of the furnace a permanent change {{in the structure of the}} refractories occurs, reaching a depth of about 4 - 5 cm from the internal side of the furnace. The type and magnitude of this change depends on the site within the furnace from which samples have been taken. The corrosion depth due to the Na+ and K+ is greater than that due to Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +. The most intense corrosion appears tit the <b>sidewall</b> <b>refractories</b> of the charging and discharging end of the furnace as well as at the glass air interface refractories...|$|E
40|$|Taphole clays are {{a plastic}} ceramic-polymer {{composite}} used in iron making blast furnaces {{to control the}} casting of hot metal and slag from the blast furnace. They also protect the <b>sidewall</b> <b>refractories</b> in the blast furnace from erosion and corrosion. Taphole clays generally consist of liquid binder, refractory matrix, and refractory aggregate. A novolak resin solution {{has been used in}} this study because it is a common binder used in industry. The matrix material is usually a mixture of fine particles of silicon carbide, coke, alumina, and other special additives. The aggregate materialconsists of coarse particles of alumina or alumino-silicates. Studies on taphole clays to date have generally focused on the effect of compositional variations on their performance. Extrusion behaviour is known to highly influence the performance of taphole clays but has not been previously studied in depth. In this thesis the rheology of the taphole clay mixtures and their components are studied. The binder was aged at various temperatures with and without the addition of the curing agent hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA). The effect of temperature and curing time was assessed based on the binder 2 ̆ 7 s viscosity. Extrusion pressure variation in the mixture of binder and matrix material due to ageing, temperature and binder composition was also studied. The Benbow-Bridgwater model for paste extrusion was used to evaluate the extrusion pressures. The aggregate material was not added in this study and will be the focus of future work. Major findings of this study were that the binder was found to react with HMTA at temperatures above 40 °C producing an increase in viscosity. This reaction occurred at temperatures much lower than had previously been reported. Without the addition of HMTA there was found to be no significant change in the viscosity of the binder. When the binder and HMTA mixture was heated to temperatures of 70 °C and above, the reaction was rapid, taking less than 12 hours to observe a significant viscosity increase. Again, these cure temperatures were lower than reported in previous studies. It is proposed that the increased mobility of the polymer chains due to the addition of the solvent is the reason these reactions were occurring at relatively low temperatures. The extrusion behaviour of different taphole clay compositions was performed by comparing parameters from the Benbow-Bridgwater equation. This study has extended the application of the Benbow-Bridgwater equation, which was previously applied to the extrusion behaviour of ceramic pastes. Studying the matrix binder material variation found that ageing at 50 °C, mixing technique and temperature all had a significant effect on the extrusion pressure. The effect of temperature of extrusion was also examined and found to be a significant factor in extrusion behaviour. A novel variation to the Benbow-Bridgwater equation is proposed to account for these temperature changes. It is envisaged that this work will be used to modify blast furnace taphole clay storage and utilization procedures to obtain more consistent taphole clay behaviour. This work also provides an understanding of the factors that can contribute to the variability observed in the extrusion pressures of taphole clays. Having a greater understanding of the external factors that can lead to significant differences in taphole clay performance will lead to better operating conditions in the blast furnace and a longer furnace life...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{research}} on cermet inert anodes for aluminium production, {{it has been}} suggested that nickel ferrite spinel might be suitable for use as a <b>sidewall</b> <b>refractory</b> in Hall-Héroult cells. A corrosion resistant sidewall would allow elimination of the frozen bath ledge, and has potentially huge benefits in terms of energy savings and increased productivity. However, little work has been done to assess nickel ferrite 2 ̆ 7 s suitability as a refractory. Dense nickel ferrite samples were prepared and characterized, and corrosion tests in cryolite based baths were conducted. Results confirm that the spinel does have good corrosion resistance. The corrosion mechanism is complex, involving grain boundary attack and formation of a Ni - Fe alloy. This alloy could pose a risk in terms of contamination of the aluminium. The use of additives to restrict penetration of grain boundaries may be the key to development of a successful spinel based refractory...|$|R
40|$|In April 2013 a 48 MVA {{submerged}} {{arc furnace}} producing silicomanganese was excavated in South Africa. Since the high shell temperatures {{recorded in the}} tap-hole area resulted in the furnace being switched out for relining, the tap-hole area was excavated systematically. A refractory wear profile of the tap-hole area with affected hearth and <b>sidewall</b> <b>refractory</b> was obtained in elevation. The carbon ramming paste in front of, above, and below the tap-hole was worn, as was the SiC with which the tap-hole was built. A clay mushroom formed but was detached from the refractories. Thermodynamic and mass-transfer calculations were conducted to quantify the potential for wear by chemical reaction between refractory and slag and refractory and metal in the tap-hole area. It was found that chemical reaction between refractory and slag or metal could offer only a partial explanation for the wear observed; erosion is expected to contribute significantly to wear.

40|$|Steel ladle {{sidewall}} buildup is {{a phenomenon}} that has been observed in steel plants across the world. A laboratory-based investigation that involved immersing test rods of ladle <b>refractory</b> <b>sidewall</b> brick into molten slags of varying compositions was conducted. The mechanism of sidewall buildup was subsequently investigated by varying the thermal regime following slag immersion and observing the resulting microstructures. Slags high in silica exhibited a discontinuous precipitation of corundum, with an additional deposit of anorthite depending on the cooling rate following slag immersion. Slags containing large quantities of alumina were observed to form well-defined bands of hibonite and calcium dialuminate, {{in addition to a}} matrix in some regions, which contained spinel and calcium aluminate. Increasing lime in high-alumina slags was observed to decrease the quantity of slag deposited on the test rods. Experimental results suggest that the mechanism of sidewall buildup may involve a dual-stage process in which dissolution of the sidewall into the bulk slag layer during casting contributes to a loss of material, and dissolution into an adhered liquid layer following casting promotes the formation of solid phases and contributes to increased sidewall thickness...|$|R
