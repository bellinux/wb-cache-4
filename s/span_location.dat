As designers attempt lighter and more flexible wind energy machines, greater accuracy and robustness {{will become even more}} critical in future aerodynamics models. Aerodynamics modeling advances, in turn, will rely on more thorough comprehension of the three-dimensional, unsteady, vortical flows that dominate wind turbine blade aerodynamics under high load conditions. To experimentally characterize these flows, turbine blade surface pressures were acquired at multiple span locations via the NREL Phase IV Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment. Surface pressures and associated normal force histories were used to characterize dynamic stall vortex kinematics and normal force amplification. Dynamic stall vortices and normal force amplification were confirmed to occur in response to angle of attack excursions above the static stall threshold. Stall vortices occupied approximately one-half of the blade span and persisted for nearly one-fourth of the blade rotation cycle. Stall vortex convection varied along the blade, resulting in dramatic deformation of the vortex. Presence and deformation of the dynamic stall vortex produced corresponding amplification of normal forces. Analyses revealed consistent alterations to vortex kinematics in response to changes in reduced frequency, <b>span</b> <b>location,</b> and yaw error. Finally, vortex structures and kinematics not previously documented for wind turbine blades were isolated...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{high-cycle fatigue}} (HCF) related {{failures}} of gas-turbine jet engines have prompted a re-examination {{of the design}} methodologies for HCF-critical components, such as titanium alloy turbine blades. As foreign-object damage (FOD) from ingested debris is a key concern for HCF-related failures of such blades, {{the current study is}} focused on the role of simulated high velocity FOD in affecting the initiation and early growth of small surface fatigue cracks in a Ti [...] 6 Al [...] 4 V alloy, processed for typical blade applications. It is found that resistance to HCF is markedly reduced, primarily due to earlier fatigue crack initiation. The mechanistic effect of FOD on such premature fatigue crack initiation and the subsequent crack growth is discussed in terms of four prominent factors: (i) the presence of small microcracks in the damaged zone; (ii) the stress concentration associated with the FOD indentation; (iii) the localized presence of tensile residual hoop stresses at the base and rim of the indent sites; and (iv) microstructural damage from FOD-induced plastic deformation. In view of the in-service conditions, i. e., small crack sizes, high frequency (# 1 kHz) vibratory loading and (depending on the blade <b>span</b> <b>location)</b> high mean stress levels, a damage-tolerant design approach, based on the concept of a threshold for no fatigue-crack growth, appears to offer a preferred solution. It is shown that FOD-initiated cracks that are of a size comparable with microstructural dimensions can propagate at applied stress-intensity ranges on the order of #K# 1 MPa#m. 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Effectiveness of self-adaptive flaps in delaying flow {{separation}} on low aspect ratio wings {{of three different}} planforms were ascertained experimentally in a low speed wind tunnel at a Reynolds number of 105 based on their root chord. Flap widths between 0. 08 c and 0. 15 c; placement location between 0. 4 x/c and 0. 8 x/c were investigated. The flapped configurations exhibit good stall margin and higher CLmax in most cases. The chordwise placement location of adaptive flap for better lift enhancement varies with planform. Adaptive flaps placed at the maximum <b>span</b> <b>location</b> on a varying span planform exhibit better lift characteristics than flaps placed at other chordwise location. However, for a constant span planform like rectangle, chordwise location close to trailing edge seems to be optimal for flap placement. Full span flaps were efficient in obstructing the forward progression of reverse flow from stall vortex than part span flaps. The lift enhancing capabilities of double adaptive flapped configuration was relatively low compared to single adaptive flapped configuration. No detrimental effects were observed in the drag characteristics of the single flapped configurations of rectangular and inverse Zimmerman planform. However, significant drag increase was observed for the flapped configurations of Zimmerman model and double flapped configurations. The temporal behavior of the adaptive flap is aperiodic. Spectral analysis of the adaptive flap oscillation shows that it oscillates at multiple frequencies and the wing planform only influence the mean angle and magnitude of oscillation, while frequency of the oscillation seems to be flow dependent...|$|E

40|$|The silent-aircraft {{experimental}} {{aircraft are}} balanced by generating lift near the aircraft nose through leadingedge carving of the centerbody. The use of leading-edge carving over the centerbody is novel, in that previous blended-wing–body aircraft have balanced the aircraft by downloading the centerbody (via reflex camber) {{to achieve the}} effect of a tail. This paper decomposes the aerodynamic forces into contributions from spanwise sections to explain how three-dimensional flow effects are beneficial in allowing the silent-aircraft experimental aircraft to be both statically stable and to have an elliptical lift distribution over a large range of angles of attack. By analyzing the results in this manner, rationale is also given as to why, unlike other blended-wing–body-type configurations, the silent-aircraft-experimental design can use supercritical unstable-outer-wing airfoil profiles to generate a balanced and stable aircraft. The results are then used to develop a methodology to aid the aircraft designer in determining the amount of leading-edge carving that is necessary to achieve static stability for blended-wing–body-type aircraft.

In order to illustrate and compare the {{formation and}} downstream development of wingtip vortices, the analyses were conducted for two widely-different cases of spanwise distribution of bound-vorticity. Termed inboard and outboard distributions, the loadings were nearly triangular and rectangular, respectively. For development analysis, Biot-Savart field calculations were conducted for the induced velocity field, and hence displacement {{of the elements of}} the shed vorticity sheet. Although an induced field calculation does not represent all fluid-element forces (in particular, the expansion pressure field) and thus, might over-estimate core radius for example), the comparative calculations provided results of interest, regarding the properties of developed wingtip vortices, such as core radius, <b>span</b> <b>location,</b> core asymmetry and peak velocity location. Following this and with reference to the NRC flight measurements of small, intense vortex elements with peaks greater than potential vortex peaks, centrifugal stability analysis is conducted, using a number of models: (1) the developed vortices for the outboard loading case were stimulated with, and released from, radial forcing; (2) a physical model of the centrifugal balance between inertia and pressure forces was examined by time-wise solution of the equations of elemental equations of motion, and (3) the Euler equations in axisymmetric, cylindrical coordinate form were numerically, spatiotemporally solved for excess-velocity vortex profiles.

This actuator is an improvement over one developed previously at MIT. The design utilizes a new exure mechanism to connect the piezoelectric bender to the control surface. The e ciency of the bender was improved by tapering its thickness properties with length. Also, implementation of a nonlinear circuit allowing {{the application of a}} greater range of actuator voltages increased the resultant strain levels. Experiments were carried out on the bench top to determine the frequency response of the actuator, as well as hinge moment and displacement capabilities. Flap de ections of 11. 5 deg were demonstrated while operating under no load conditions at 10 Hz. Excessive creep at low frequencies precluded the measurement of achievable hinge moments, but extrapolation from de ection and voltage characteristics indicate that if properly scaled, the present actuator will produce ap de ections greater than 5 deg at the 90 % <b>span</b> <b>location</b> on an operational helicopter. In addition, the rst mode of the actuator was at seven times the rotational frequency (7 /rev) of the target model scale rotor. Proper inertial scaling of this actuator could raise this modal frequency to 10 /rev on an operational helicopter, which is adequate for most rotor control purposes. A linear state space model of the actuator was derived. Comparisons of this model with the experimental data highlighted a number of mild nonlinearities in the actuator's response.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are carried}} out for a long slender rigid circular cylinder in a cross-flow to examine three-dimensional (3 -D) wake effects on the flow-induced forces. The aim is to assess the validity and extent of the two-dimensional (2 -D) assumption for both the mean drag and the flow-induced forces. In order to simulate the practical situation correctly, wall boundary conditions are specified {{at both ends of}} the cylinder. The long slender cylinder has different aspect ratios. A finite volume method (FVM) and a lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) are used to carry out the computations, and their results are compared with each other and with available experimental and simulation data. As a first attempt to assess the 2 -D assumption, a Reynolds number Re = 100 and an aspect ratio a = 16 are chosen. At this Re and a, conventional experimental and numerical studies assume that the time-averaged flow is homogeneous and 2 -D over a relatively large portion of the central span. However, present simulations indicate that vortex shedding from the nominally 2 -D cylinder strongly depends on the <b>span</b> <b>location</b> and the flow-induced forces exhibit strong three dimensionality. The calculated mean drag and root-mean-square lift and drag vary greatly along the span. These results indicate that the 2 -D assumption is not valid for the flow-induced forces, not even within a small region of the central span, for the aspect ratio examined. The validity and extent of the periodic boundary conditions assumption for a 3 -D simulation of the flow and induced forces on a cylinder in a cross-flow is examined next. It is found that, within the range of a investigated, an appropriate period could not be found for the numerical simulation. The results further show that a has a significant effect on the calculated wake flow and the flow-induced forces. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E

Investigations concerning the genomic features of young gene duplicates can enhance our understanding of the nature of gene duplicates at inception and their fates over evolutionary time. Previous analysis of young gene duplicates in Caenorhabditis elegans has revealed genomic features of evolutionarily young gene duplicates with respect to structure, <b>span,</b> <b>location</b> and orientation of paralogous genes. The analysis of young gene duplicate pairs in Caenorhabditis briggsae provides insight into the characteristics of gene duplication in another member of the genus Caenorhabditis. The identification of 376 evolutionarily young gene duplicate pairs with less than 10 % sequence divergence at synonymous sites and subsequent exploration of certain genomic, structural, and evolutionary features enhances our understanding of gene duplication in eukaryotic species. The mean duplication span of 3. 6 kb in young C. briggsae gene duplicates is large compared to the mean transcript length of 2. 7 kb. The relatively large size of a gene duplicate likely contributes to the abundance of structurally complete C. briggsae gene duplicates. The majority of very young duplicates (KS = 0) are in direct orientation on the same chromosome. Though evolutionarily older gene duplicates (0 < KS ≤ 0. 10) tend to remain on the same chromosome, they are more likely to be in inverse orientation. Analysis of selective constraints acting on C. briggsae paralogs reveals that the majority of young duplicates are under weak purifying selection regardless of duplication structure. Here I show that, despite its relatively close evolutionary proximity to C. elegans, gene duplicates in C. briggsae exhibit some strikingly unique genomic characteristics.

40|$|A set of {{inlet guide}} vane (IGV) {{unsteady}} surface pressure measurements of a transonic compressor is presented. Using a flexible pressure sensor array, unsteady IGV suction-surface and pressure-surface pressures are acquired for six spanwise by five chordwise locations for various speed lines and throttle settings. Measurements from this sensor array are used to investigate unsteady vane/blade interaction aeromechanical forcing functions in a modern, highly loaded compressor stage. A significant effect is shown on the unsteady forced response of the IGV with changes in compressor operating point and IGV/rotor axial spacing for various span and chord locations. In particular, variations in the compressor operating point (i. e., mass flow rate and pressure ratio) cause change in both the magnitude and phase of the forced response, with the near-stall operating point producing the highest response. Changes in the axial spacing between the IGV and rotor rows from 12 % to 26 % of the IGV chord resulted in a 50 % reduction in {{the magnitude of the}} forced response. A significant variation in the forced response with span is noted, especially at the 5 % <b>span</b> <b>location</b> where the rotor relative flow is subsonic. In this region, changes in the operating point and axial spacing had a negligible effect on the forced response of the IGV. An innovative data reduction/analysis method is presented to quantify and statistically analyze the degree of blade-to-blade variations in the measured aerodynamic forcing functions obtained by turbomachinery experimentation. This method is used to analyze experimental data of IGV surface unsteady pressure response due to the aerodynamic forcing function produced by the downstream transonic compressor rotor with (1) factory-whole blades and (2) trimmed (blended) blades resulting from the repair of crack damage on two of the rotor blades. Results from the variation metric and l 2 -norm analysis indicate that the scaled metric possesses large magnitude change versus blade index for the trimmed rotor compared to that of the untrimmed rotor, with the largest values occurring near the trimmed blades. Each method is nearly always able to detect the trimmed blades. Using the distance between cluster centroids from the K-means cluster analysis as a metric of variation within each rotor, cluster distances increased by as much as a factor of 4 for the trimmed rotor compared to the untrimmed rotor. Therefore, correctly identifying the trimmed rotor data as having a significantly higher amount of blade-to-blade variability. Finally using the cluster distance as a goodness parameter for variability, the non-trimmed data was investigated for trends with changes in compressor operating conditions. This analysis showed an increase in blade-to-blade variability with increases in the compressor flow rate. Therefore, this data reduction/analysis method {{has the potential to be}} utilized as an indicator of the compressor operating point for control methods...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAxial Compressors used in {{gas turbine}} engines are {{susceptible}} to stall. This phenomenon is more prevalent in aero gas turbine engines, due to requirement of varied operating conditions based on flight envelop. There {{are a number of}} methodologies in use for increasing stall margin of compressor and hence the operating range of the engines. One of such most widely used techniques is circumferential casing grooves. Circumferential casing grooves helps in increasing stall limit, but generally with a penalty on efficiency, by breaking down tip vortices. In order to increase the efficiency and pressure ratio, rotor blades are designed to reduce secondary losses. Designing blades with lean and sweep are one of the techniques to reduce secondary flow losses. A number of literatures are available in public domain, giving detailed understanding of effect of circumferential groove and 3 D blade features like lean and sweep. In this current work, an effort is made to understand the interaction effect of lean and circumferential grooves, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In order to use CFD as a tool to understand flow physics and predict performance, a thorough validation is carried out. CFD results, both performance parameters as well as span-wise distribution of different flow variables, are compared with available experimental data of NASA Rotor 37. Current investigation starts with generation of a baseline rotor, having no lean and no sweep. The rotor geometry is created using hub and tip profiles of NASA Rotor 37. Flow path used for this rotor is same as that of NASA Rotor 37. The profiles are stacked along a radial line through the center of gravities of the profiles. This has resulted in desired geometry, without lean and sweep. Slight modification is made in terms of stagger angle of the tip profiles, to get comparable performance as NASA Rotor 37. Five circumferential casing grooves between leading edge and trailing edge of the rotor are created as per industry standard. Meshing and modeling are done according to the best practices developed while validating CFD methodology. Analyses of baseline rotor are carried out from choke to stall, with solid shroud as well as grooved shroud. Grooves shroud has resulted in higher stall margin, as expected. In order to study the interaction effect of casing grooves with lean, a number of different rotors geometries are generated with varying amount of lean as well as different <b>span</b> <b>location</b> from where lean starts. Results obtained from these numerical simulations are presented in this paper.

40|$|Vortex-Induced Vibration {{of marine}} risers has been {{receiving}} increasing interest from both industry and academics as offshore {{oil and gas}} exploration moves into deeper water regions. A regular vortex pattern is formed in the wake of cylindrical risers that interacts with the cylinder motion and is the main source that causes elastically mounted cylinders to vibrate. Wake field studies of Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV) for a long flexible cylinder can help to better understand the physical mechanisms of the interaction between the body response and the wake vortex. The presented work consists of two major parts: some preliminary tests for the Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) system of the Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN) and the Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV) wake field research using DPIV. These preliminary tests were conducted in small water tanks and the MUN towing tank. Some essential parameters and techniques using PIV were also investigated through these preliminary tests. The VIV wake field measurement experiments were performed in the ice tank, Institute for Ocean Technology (IOT). Vibration responses in both in-line and cross-flow directions of a long flexible cylinder, with a diameter of 47 mm and length to diameter ratio of 181, in a free stream, were investigated at moderate Reynolds number in the range of 9400 - 47000. The DPIV system was employed to measure the wake velocity field and vorticity field behind the cylinder, simultaneously with acceleration measurements of the cylinder. The experimental results show VIV responses in both in-line and cross-flow directions at the <b>span</b> <b>location</b> z/L= 0. 43, and with a mix of vibration frequencies and amplitudes. With the increase of the flow speeds, vibration frequencies became higher in both in-line and cross-flow directions. The vibration frequencies of the cylinder were in a range of 0. 64 Hz to 10. 38 Hz over the range of Reynolds numbers. The amplitude did not obviously increase with an increase of Reynolds number. The amplitude to diameter ratio in the in-line and cross-flow directions covered a range of 0. 10 - 0. 41 and 0. 24 - 0. 95, respectively. The flow field measurement results reveal that for a certain value of the vibration frequency, f, the Reynolds number, Re, and the amplitude to diameter ratio, AID, three vortex modes ' 2 S', ' 2 P' and 'P+S' are observed in the near wake of the cylinder. At the lower Reynolds number, Re= 9400, and with lower response frequencies from 0. 61 Hz to 1. 28 Hz, only ' 2 S' vortex modes were observed in the experiments, and the ' 2 S' vortex modes presented were stable. With an increase of the Reynolds number, at Re= 141 00 and with frequencies from 0. 95 Hz to 2. 74 Hz, two vortex modes, ' 2 P' and 'P+S', were observed in the near wake at different times. The ' 2 P' mode was dominant at this Reynolds number. Vortex modes ' 2 S' and ' 2 P' were observed at different times when the Reynolds number further increased, to Re= 18800 and 23500 and with frequencies from 1. 34 Hz to 4. 79 Hz. The vortex pattern ' 2 S' played a main role in the wake at the two speeds. At higher Reynolds number, Re> 23500, and with frequencies from 1. 86 Hz to 10. 38 Hz, ' 2 S' and ' 2 P' vortex modes were also observed at different times and the vortex patterns presented were unstable due to velocity fluctuation and quick diffusion of vortices in the wake. The percentage of the vortex pattern ' 2 P' increases at higher speeds. The results also showed that the vortex modes ' 2 S' and ' 2 P' were repeatable with the same vibration responses of displacements and accelerations...|$|E
40|$|Grid {{technologies}} aim at enabling {{a coordinated}} resource-sharing and problem-solving capabilities over local and wide area networks and <b>span</b> <b>locations,</b> organizations, machine architectures and software boundaries. The heterogeneity of involved {{resources and the}} need for interoperability among different grid middlewares require the sharing of a common information model. Abstractions of different flavors of resources and services and conceptual schemas of domain specific entities require a collaboration effort in order to enable a coherent information services cooperation. With this paper, we present the result of our experience in grid resources and services modelling carried out within the Grid Laboratory Uniform Environment (GLUE) effort, a joint US and EU High Energy Physics projects collaboration towards grid interoperability. The first implementation-neutral agreement on services such as batch computing and storage manager, resources such as the hierarchy cluster, sub-cluster, host and the storage library are presented. Design guidelines and operational results are depicted together with open issues and future evolutions. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{application}} PIV {{was chosen to}} analyze the complex flow phenomena inside a vaned diffuser {{of a new generation}} transonic centrifugal compressor, as this planar technique is capable of detecting unsteady flow structures and to resolve even high velocity gradients as well as unsteady shock configurations previously undetectable with point-wise techniques such as laser- 2 -focus velocimetry (L 2 F). Measurements were carried out at rotational speeds between 35, 000 and 50, 000 rpm. The compressor stage was designed for a pressure ratio of 6 : 1. Due to the advanced impeller geometry the diffuser section has a conical shape and a constant passage height of 8. 1 mm. With a special light sheet periscope probe is was possible to adjust the light sheet to three vane <b>span</b> <b>locations</b> chosen for flow investigation: center plane (50 %), one plane close to the hub (19 %) and one close to the tip (74 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{pressure}} {{data from}} the National Renewable Energy Laboratory`s ``Combined Experiment`` were analyzed to provide a statistical representation of dynamic stall occurrence on a downwind {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} (HAWT). Over twenty thousand blade rotational cycles were each characterized at four <b>span</b> <b>locations</b> by the maximum leading edge suction pressure and by the azimuth, velocity, and yaw at which it occurred. Peak suction values at least twice that seen in static wind tunnel tests were taken to be indicative of dynamic stall. The occurrence of dynamic stall at all but the inboard station (30 % span) shows good quantitative agreement with the theoretical limits on inflow velocity and yaw that should yield dynamic stall. Two hypotheses were developed to explain the discrepancy at 30 % span. Estimates are also given for the frequency of dynamic stall occurrence on upwind turbines. Operational regimes were identified which minimize the occurrence of dynamic stall events...|$|R
