5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, it was found that under certain conditions a fast-moving charged particle caused a condensation of <b>supersaturated</b> water vapor along its path. In 1911, Charles Wilson used this principle to devise his cloud chamber so he could photograph the tracks of charged particles, such as fast-moving electrons.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} a fast tissue {{and might be}} in <b>supersaturated</b> state in the early phase of decompression. It acts as a gas {{reservoir}} and feeds any local bubble which will grow. The bubble may just proceed through the capillaries to the venous side for another cycle, but may be trapped and will then grow in place, causing local restriction of the blood supply and finally ischemia. This may develop into central neurological symptoms.|$|E
5|$|If the ionic {{compound}} is soluble in a solvent, it can {{be obtained}} as a solid compound by evaporating the solvent from this electrolyte solution. As the solvent is evaporated, the ions do not go into the vapour, but stay in the remaining solution, and when they become sufficiently concentrated, nucleation occurs, and they crystallize into an ionic compound. This process occurs widely in nature, and is the means of formation of the evaporite minerals. Another method of recovering the compound from solution involves saturating a solution at high temperature and then reducing the solubility by reducing the temperature until the solution is <b>supersaturated</b> and the solid compound nucleates.|$|E

5|$|A {{snowflake}} is {{a single}} ice crystal that has achieved a sufficient size, and may have amalgamated with others, then falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in <b>supersaturated</b> air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{concentrations of}} gases {{in any given}} tissue depend {{on the history of}} pressure and gas composition. Under equilibrium conditions, the total concentration of dissolved gases is less than the ambient pressure—as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues, and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble. However, during a reduction in ambient pressure, the rate of pressure reduction may exceed the rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion. If the concentration gets too high, it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the <b>supersaturated</b> tissues. When the pressure of gases in a bubble exceed the combined external pressures of ambient pressure and the surface tension of the bubble-liquid interface, the bubbles grow, and this growth can damage tissue.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, <b>supersaturated</b> form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E

5|$|It is {{extremely}} difficult to predict good conditions for nucleation or growth of well-ordered crystals. In practice, favorable conditions are identified by screening; a very large batch of the molecules is prepared, and a wide variety of crystallization solutions are tested. Hundreds, even thousands, of solution conditions are generally tried before finding the successful one. The various conditions can use one or more physical mechanisms to lower the solubility of the molecule; for example, some may change the pH, some contain salts of the Hofmeister series or chemicals that lower the dielectric constant of the solution, and still others contain large polymers such as polyethylene glycol that drive the molecule out of solution by entropic effects. It is also common to try several temperatures for encouraging crystallization, or to gradually lower the temperature so that the solution becomes <b>supersaturated.</b> These methods require large amounts of the target molecule, as they use high concentration of the molecule(s) to be crystallized. Due to the difficulty in obtaining such large quantities (milligrams) of crystallization-grade protein, robots have been developed that are capable of accurately dispensing crystallization trial drops that are in the order of 100 nanoliters in volume. This means that 10-fold less protein is used per experiment when compared to crystallization trials set up by hand (in the order of 1 microliter).|$|E
5|$|Once a droplet has frozen, {{it grows}} in the <b>super{{saturated}}</b> environment, which is one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by deposition of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets {{are so much more}} numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size {{at the expense of the}} water droplets. This process is known as the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the droplets to evaporate, meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground. Guinness World Records lists the world's largest (aggregate) snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh, Montana; allegedly one measured 15inches (38cm) wide. Although this report by a farmer is doubtful, aggregates of three or four inches width have been observed. Single crystals the size of a dime (17.91mm in diameter) have been observed. Snowflakes encapsulated in rime form balls known as graupel.|$|E

40|$|Gaboxadol (THIP; 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydroisoxazolo[5, 4 -c]pyridin- 3 -ol) is an agonist at GABA(A) receptors. THIP {{concentrations}} (0. 01 - 50 mM) {{were applied}} rapidly to Sf 9 cells expressing the human alpha(1) beta(2) gamma(2 S) GABA(A) receptors. The EC 50 {{values for the}} peak current in THIP alone or THIP plus 1 muM diazepam were 154 and 53 muM, respectively. In <b>supersaturating</b> THIP (10 - 50 mM) the rate of current decay increased and an off-current developed when THIP was rapidly removed. The mean currents measured over the first 4 s in 10 mM and higher THIP concentrations were 0. 6 or less of the 1 mM THIP mean current. Diazepam (1 muM) increased the 4 s mean current when evoked by 10 to 20 mM THIP but not 50 mM THIP. No similar effects on the current time-course were recorded in <b>supersaturating</b> gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations (50 and 80 mM). The results demonstrate an inhibitory as well as agonist effect of THIP at alpha(1) beta(2) gamma(2 s) GABA(A) receptors. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Diel {{nitrogen}} fixation studies {{were conducted with}} assemblages of cyanobacteria sampled from surface blooms on Sanctuary Lake, Pa. The studies were conducted between July and September of 1982 to 1985 by using the acetylene reduction technique. Assemblages with the lowest cell concentrations (0. 9 × 109 to 1. 0 × 109 cells per liter) exhibited {{nitrogen fixation}} activity throughout the day, with maximum fixation rates occurring in mid to late afternoon; fixation proceeded throughout the night at rates equivalent to 23 to 28 % of the afternoon maximum. In studies conducted with the highest cell concentrations (3. 7 × 109 to 6. 7 × 109 cells per liter), fixation rates reached maximum values in mid to late morning. The rates declined rapidly throughout the midday period and subsequently ceased from late afternoon until sunrise on the following day. The afternoon decline and cessation of fixation exhibited by high cell concentrations correlated with photosynthetically induced low total CO 2 and <b>supersaturating</b> O 2 concentrations. The midday decline could be prevented and partially reversed by experimentally lowering O 2 and increasing total CO 2 concentrations. Under experimental conditions which simultaneously prevented <b>supersaturating</b> O 2 concentrations and maintained high total CO 2 availability, nitrogen fixation continued throughout the solar day, with maximum rates occurring at midday. These observations indicate that temporal changes in photosynthetic activity may affect diel fluctuations in nitrogen fixation...|$|R

25|$|Gas remains {{dissolved}} in the tissues until the partial pressure of that {{gas in the}} lungs is reduced sufficiently to cause a concentration gradient with the blood at a lower concentration than the relevant tissues.

When the partial pressure of all gas {{dissolved in}} a tissue exceeds the total ambient pressure on the tissue it is <b>supersaturated,</b> and there is a possibility of bubble formation.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of release rate from ordered mesoporous silica materials on the rate and extent of absorption of the poorly soluble drug fenofibrate. Three ordered mesoporous silica materials with different pore diameter (7. 3 nm, 4. 4 nm and 2. 7 nm) were synthesized and loaded with fenofibrate via impregnation. Release experiments were conducted under sink conditions and under <b>supersaturating</b> conditions in biorelevant media, simulating the fasted and the fed state. Subsequently, all silica-based formulations were evaluated in vivo (rat model). The release experiments under sink conditions indicated a clear increase in release rate with increasing pore size. However, under <b>supersaturating</b> conditions (FaSSIF), the, pharmaceutical performance (in terms of both the degree and duration of supersaturation), increased with decreasing pore size. The same trend was observed in vivo (fasted state) : the area under the plasma concentration–time profile amounted to 102 ± 34 Mh, 86 ± 19 Mh and 20 ± 13 Mh for the materials with pore diameter of 2. 7 nm, 4. 4 nm and 7. 3 nm, respectively.
