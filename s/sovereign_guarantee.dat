Estrada reached the {{pinnacle}} of his political career when he was elected President of the Republic in the May 11, 1998 national elections. With almost 11-million Filipinos writing his name on the ballot, his margin of victory was the biggest ever registered in Philippine electoral history. Speaking before millions gathered at his inaugural address in Manila, the newly elected chief executive said his presidency would serve the Filipino masses whose welfare had long been neglected. A line from his speech, [...] "Walang kaibigan, walang kumpare, walang kamag-anak", was a stern warning against anyone who would attempt to undermine his administration with influence-peddling. Determined to bring his pro-poor platform to every facet of the government's operations, he immediately ordered the removal of all sovereign guarantees on contracts for public projects which would require the sovereign Filipino people to assume the financial losses of private companies doing business with the government. Records will show that until January 20, 2001, he did not sign a single government contract with a <b>sovereign</b> <b>guarantee.</b> Committed to cleaning the bureaucracy of undesirable elements, he ordered the immediate relief of corrupt officials in the military and police hierarchy. He ordered a wide-ranging investigation of all government contracts entered into by the previous administration to ensure these were above-board and directly advantageous to the citizenry. He ordered the investigation of suspected big-time tax evaders even if some of these individuals had contributed to his presidential campaign. His pro-poor program of government bore fruit in less than two years, with a significant improvement in the country's peace and order situation. This likewise elicited a proportionate rise in the approval rating of the Philippine National Police. The Estrada administration undertook an aggressive housing program on a national basis, targeting low-cost homes for the poor. Agriculture received greater priority, while the national government likewise took steps to bring down the cost of medicine.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how contract specificities affect {{the performance of}} municipal infrastructure projects in transportation, district heating, water, waste water and solid waste. Using data from projects financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), {{we look at the}} effect of involving private parties with different degrees of risk, and involving public parties other than the respective municipality. In particular, central authorities may provide a <b>sovereign</b> <b>guarantee</b> for the funds lent by the Bank. We construct two types of performance measures. First, timeliness of the projects is measured by (i) the total length of delays, (ii) the delays between signing and disbursement of funds and (iii) the occurrence of political disruptions of the projects. Secondly, to measure financial and commercial performance we look at whether (iv) financial covenants and (v) covenants about tariffs for infrastructure use were reached. We find that private participation without commercial risk (for instance, works or turnkey projects) tends to increase project performance. Private participation with commercial risk has no significant effect on project performance. Sovereign guarantees reduce delays but also decrease financial discipline. These effects are robust against potential selection effects, which we control for through instrumental variable regressions. public private, contracts, <b>sovereign</b> <b>guarantee,</b> risk sharing...|$|E

40|$|This {{evaluation}} {{examines the}} IDB's non-sovereign operations with sub-national entities during the 2007 - 2010 period. The delivery of loans to sub-national borrowers {{in this period}} was modest, not even near breaching the one-third ceiling. Attention to the sub-national sector is important in Latin America, because effective public service delivery is critical for poverty reduction, low gross capital formation is hindering development in the region, and decentralization has increasingly placed investment decisions for infrastructure services at the sub-national level. This presents {{an opportunity for the}} IDB, as, compared to peer multilaterals, it has a limited share in this sector. Therefore, OVE advises to: (i) further understand the potential market for sub-national lending, analyzing and mapping eligible and currently excluded sub-national entities in client countries, using alternative policy scenarios for both <b>sovereign</b> <b>guaranteed</b> and non-sovereign guaranteed operations; (ii) review the guidelines and practices of peer multilaterals to determine the desirability and feasibility of emulating them; and (iii) propose changes to existing policy and guidelines such that the IDB can better serve currently excluded sub-national enterprises through non-sovereign guaranteed lending. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of whether, {{and to what}} extent, markets price contract terms in government bond issues {{has been one of}} considerable debate in the literature.

These contract terms turned out to be important for the holders of guaranteed bonds during the Greek debt restructuring of 2012, where they helped the holders of guaranteed bonds escape the haircut that other holders of Greek sovereign debt suffered. We find evidence that the market did indeed price in the advantage that guaranteed bonds had over other bonds in the months immediately prior to the Greek restructuring. However, we also find that this evidence of highly rational pricing disappears in the post crisis period. And instead, we find what looks like a pricing anomaly, where rational pricing is inverted...|$|R

40|$|This paper characterises {{the effects}} of reserve {{requirements}} on ®nancial loans {{in the presence of}} moral hazard on the lender side and sovereign risk on the borrower side. The impacts of such reserve requirements on the equilibrium default risk and borrowing are analysed and their welfare implications discussed.

The introduction of a reserve requirement in either country reduces the default risk and raises the welfare of both the high-income and the emerging-market economies. `Accordingly, it might be useful to consider ways in which some added discipline could be imposed on the interbank market.

40|$|We {{show that}} nancial sector bailouts and {{sovereign}} credit risk are intimately linked. A bailout benets {{the economy by}} ameliorating the under-investment problem of the nancial sector. However, increasing taxation of the non-nancial sector to fund the bailout may be inecient since it weakens its incentive to invest, decreasing growth. Instead, the sovereign may choose to fund the bailout by diluting existing government bondholders, resulting in a deterioration of the sovereign's creditworthiness. This deterioration feeds back to the nancial sector, reducing {{the value of its}} guarantees and existing bond holdings as well as increasing its sensitivity to future sovereign shocks. We provide empirical evidence for this two-way feedback between nancial and sovereign credit risk using data on the credit default swaps (CDS) of the Eurozone countries and their banks for 2007 - 11. We show that the announcement of nancial sector bailouts was associated with an immediate, unprecedented widening of sovereign CDS spreads and narrowing of bank CDS spreads; however, post-bailouts there emerged a signi- cant co-movement between bank CDS and sovereign CDS, even after controlling for banks' equity performance, the latter being consistent with an eect of the quality of <b>sovereign</b> <b>guarantees</b> on bank credit risk. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show a {{creative}} way to fulfill financing needs of entities involved in pre- and post-harvest production activities in extreme cases while mitigating inherent risks by Islamic structured trade finance from the real-life case of cotton production in Burkina Faso. Design/methodology/approach – The existing Islamic structured finance design for SOFITEX was analyzed in details so as to provide clear understanding of the subject matter. This structure was evaluated and a new design is proposed to better accommodate the financing need of SOFITEX. Findings – There are some inherent drawbacks, explained in details, of the existing Islamic finance structure. Salam contract for pre-harvest input financing in favor of farmers can, unlike existing structure, accommodate the complete supply chain financing solution, hence, support the whole production cycle from input procurement to the exports of cotton fiber. That is, it fits better for financing the agricultural sector. Research limitations/implications – The case and the structure studied in depth are limited to the cotton sector. This could be widened in subsequent researches. Practical implications – Islamic finance instruments provide us enough room to fulfill financing needs in extreme cases as a better alternative to conventional financing tools. A method of mark-up calculation for structured cotton trade finance is developed for Murabaha and Salam contracts. Originality/value – The paper sheds new light on how to finance the agricultural sector starting from input procurement to the sale/export by Islamic finance instruments. It also shows how to get guarantees in the form of commodities in warehouse rather than bank <b>guarantees,</b> mortgage, <b>sovereign</b> <b>guarantees,</b> etc. Cotton, Finance, Islam, Saudi Arabia, Supply chain management, Trade...|$|R

40|$|The 2008 global {{economic}} and financial crisis hit hard in Iceland. During the crisis its three largest banks all collapsed {{in just a few}} days with severe consequences for the economy and the people. Prior to the crisis, Iceland, a high income OECD country, had ex-perienced strong growth and unprecedented expansion in overseas investments and activities, especially in the financial sector. This article focuses on the actions of the international community when the Icelandic authorities, during a period of great uncertainty, sought assistance to protect the Icelandic economy before the banking system fell. The methodology used in this article is the case study method. Compared to other research methods, a case study enables the researcher to examine the issues involved in greater depth. Arguably, the governments of the Netherlands and the UK tried to fake reality by suggesting that the Icelandic government, i. e. Icelandic taxpayers, should be made responsible for paying the debts of private banks. The EFTA Court ruling confirms that Iceland did not have this responsibility. In retrospect one can argue that the EU showed dishonesty by supporting the Netherlands and the UK in demanding a <b>sovereign</b> <b>guarantee</b> for failed private banks.

40|$|This paper draws {{lessons from}} {{international}} practices {{to determine the}} feasibility of developing mortgage-backed securitization (MBS) to expand housing finance to the underserved market in the country. Despite the risks of securitization, {{as evidenced by the}} recent US subprime crisis, the huge beneficial effects of opening up the capital market to individual investors and to borrowers that were previously out of reach is well-acknowledged in literature. Several countries developed MBS to facilitate and promote housing finance. The international best practices show that efficient securitization can be established based on: (1) clear regulatory framework; (2) prudent underwriting and valuation process; (3) reliable credit rating companies to mitigate moral hazards and adverse selection risks; and (4) the need for originators to have adequate capital so that warranties and representations can be taken seriously. In particular, the US subprime crisis highlights a major lesson that needs to be avoided, that is, the use of securitization as a tool for balance sheet arbitrage instead of funding and investments in the real economy. In the country, the National Home Mortgage Corporation (NHMFC) was established with the same intent as the US Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. However, after three decades of existence, it was only in 2007 that NHMFC laid the building blocks to operate as a secondary mortgage institution (SMI). The corporation's initial securitization issuances were successful and twice oversubscribed. However, to enable NHMFC to efficiently function as an SMI, government needs to undertake the following: (1) strengthen the housing finance industry and rationalize the role of HGC, HDMF, and NHMFC; (2) support NHMFC to improve its balance sheet and strengthen its organizational capabilities; (3) develop standardized housing loan documents and quality underwriting through mortgage insurance; (4) integrate/create credit information data base for all housing loan borrowers; (5) provide incentives to securitization through tax exemptions, reactivation of NHMFC limited <b>sovereign</b> <b>guarantee,</b> recognition of MBS bonds and NHMFC issuances as compliance to statutory liquidity requirements of financial institutions, etc; and (6) automation of MBS servicing and reporting...|$|E
