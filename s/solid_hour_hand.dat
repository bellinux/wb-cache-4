50|$|If {{the zodiac}} signs run around inside the <b>hour</b> <b>hands,</b> either this ring rotates to align {{itself with the}} <b>hour</b> <b>hand,</b> or there's another hand, {{revolving}} once per year, which points to the sun's current zodiac sign.|$|R
50|$|An {{analog watch}} {{can be used}} to locate north and south. The Sun appears to move in the sky over a 24-hour period while the <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> of a 12-hour clock face takes twelve hours to {{complete}} one rotation. In the northern hemisphere, if the watch is rotated so that the <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> points toward the Sun, the point halfway between the <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> and 12 o'clock will indicate south. For this method to work in the southern hemisphere, the 12 is pointed toward the Sun and the point halfway between the <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> and 12 o'clock will indicate north. During daylight saving time, the same method can be employed using 1 o'clock instead of 12.|$|R
50|$|Clocks {{and watches}} with a 24-hour analog dial have an <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> that makes one {{complete}} revolution, 360°, {{in a day}} (24 hours per revolution). The more familiar 12-hour analog dial has an <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> that makes two complete revolutions in a day (12 hours per revolution).|$|R

The difference between local time and zone time, the equation of time, and (near the tropics) the non-uniform change of the Sun's azimuth at different times of day limit the accuracy of this method.|$|R

50|$|Today {{the clock}} {{displays}} the original I to XXIIII numbering around the outside, with I {{at the right}} hand side. The gilded stars are purely decorative. The signs of the zodiac are in anticlockwise order around the inner zodiac dial: the zodiac wheel rotates clockwise with the <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> but very slightly faster. As a result, the <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> moves slowly anticlockwise relative to the zodiac, so that it passes through each sign {{in the course of}} the year.|$|R

50|$|The {{indicating}} {{system is}} almost always the traditional dial with moving <b>hour</b> and minute <b>hands.</b> Many clocks have a small third hand indicating seconds on a subsidiary dial. Pendulum clocks are usually designed to be set by opening the glass face cover and manually pushing the minute hand around the dial to the correct time. The minute hand is mounted on a slipping friction sleeve which allows it to be turned on its arbor. The <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> is driven not from the wheel train but from the minute hand's shaft through a small set of gears, so rotating the minute hand manually also sets the <b>hour</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
