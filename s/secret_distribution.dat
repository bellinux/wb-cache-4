40|$|Abstract—LDPC codes, LT codes, {{and digital}} {{fountain}} tech-niques have received significant attention from both academics and {{industry in the}} past few years. By employing the underlying ideas of efficient Belief Propagation (BP) decoding process in LDPC and LT codes, this paper designs the BP-XOR codes and use them to design three classes of secret sharing schemes called BP-XOR secret sharing schemes, pseudo-BP-XOR secret sharing schemes, and LDPC secret sharing schemes. By establishing the equivalence between the edge-colored graph model and degree-two BP-XOR secret sharing schemes, we are able to design novel perfect and ideal 2 -out-of-n BP-XOR secret sharing schemes. By employing techniques from array code design, we are also able to design other (n, k) threshold LDPC secret sharing schemes. In the efficient (pseudo) BP-XOR/LDPC secret sharing schemes that we will construct, only linear number of XOR (exclusive-or) operations on binary strings are required for both <b>secret</b> <b>distribution</b> phase and secret reconstruction phase. For a comparison, we should note that Shamir secret sharing schemes require O(n logn) field operations for the <b>secret</b> <b>distribution</b> phase and O(n 2) field operations for the secret reconstruction phase. Furthermore, our schemes achieve the optimal update complexity for secret sharing schemes. By update complexity for a secret sharing scheme, we mean the average number of bits in the participant’s shares that needs to be revised when certain bit of the master secret is changed. The extremely efficient secret sharing schemes discussed in this paper could be used for massive data storage in cloud environments achieving privacy and reliability without employing encryption techniques.

40|$|Abstract—One of the {{important}} problems in secret sharing schemes is to establish bounds {{on the size of}} the shares to be given to participants in secret sharing schemes. The other important problem in secret sharing schemes is to reduce the computational complexity in both <b>secret</b> <b>distribution</b> phase and secret reconstruction phase. In this paper, we design efficient threshold (n, k) secret sharing schemes to achieve both of the above goals. In particular, we show some sufficient conditions (e. g., the secret size |s | is larger than n), for which efficient ideal secret sharing schemes exist. In the efficient ideal secret sharing schemes that we will construct, only XOR-operations on binary strings are required (which is the best we could achieve). These schemes will have many applications both in practice and in theory. For example, they could be used to design very efficient verifiable secret sharing schemes which will have broad applications in secure multi-party computation and could used to design efficient privacy preserving data storage in cloud systems.

Global Internet service companies, such as Google and Yahoo, {{recognized the importance}} of Internet service platforms and conducted self-research and development to create and utilize large cluster-based {{cloud computing}} platform technology based on low-priced commercial nodes.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} avoid the flaw of the secret shadow {{distribution}} method in the existing secret sharing schemes, a secret shadow distribution method is proposed with the ID-based public key technology integrated, which uses the participant’s private key as his master shadow. Firstly, security analyses are made on Zheng’s signcryption scheme, which shows his scheme does not offer forward secrecy. Then, an improvement is made on Zheng’s signcryption scheme and a new scheme is proposed. Based on the proposed signcryption scheme and the ID-based public key cryptosystem, a new threshold multi-secret sharing scheme is proposed. The problem of the secret shadow distribution is well resolved, and no information exchange is needed between the secret dealer and each participant in advance. The secret shadow distribution can be processed during the <b>secret</b> <b>distribution.</b> At the same time, the proposed scheme offers forward secrecy. That is to say, even if the private key of the secret dealer is exposed, the security of the shared secrets will not be threatened. Therefore, the proposed ID-based secret sharing scheme is more secure and effective than others, and it can be more applicable...|$|E
