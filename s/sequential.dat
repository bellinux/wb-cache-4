5|$|Reptation is a snake-like {{movement}} (hence the name) involving <b>sequential</b> {{motion of}} cluster sub-units (see figure 11(c)).|$|E
5|$|<b>Sequential</b> {{displacement}} {{refers to}} the process involving motion one atom at a time, moving to free nearest-neighbor sites.|$|E
5|$|Another related form of {{experiment}} is the double-task experiment, {{in which a}} subject must perform an extra task (such as <b>sequential</b> finger-tapping or articulating nonsense syllables) while responding to linguistic stimuli; this kind {{of experiment}} {{has been used to}} investigate the use of working memory in language processing.|$|E
5|$|Automatic parallelization of a <b>sequential</b> {{program by}} a {{compiler}} is {{the holy grail}} of parallel computing. Despite decades of work by compiler researchers, automatic parallelization has had only limited success.|$|E
5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : <b>sequential,</b> indexed and relative. In <b>sequential</b> files, {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed sequentially, similarly to a linked list. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a unique key, but other, , record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as C‑ISAM and VSAM, are based on IBM's ISAM. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record key, {{but they do not}} have alternate keys. A relative record's key is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a key of 10. This means that creating a record with a key of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. Relative files also allow for both <b>sequential</b> and random access.|$|E
5|$|Dislocation {{diffusion}} {{occurs when}} adjacent sub-units of a cluster {{move in a}} row-by-row fashion through displacement of a dislocation. As shown in figure 11(a) the process begins with nucleation of the dislocation followed by what is essentially <b>sequential</b> displacement on a concerted basis.|$|E
5|$|Exit {{numbers are}} <b>sequential.</b> RIDOT plans to {{renumber}} all exits, including those on Route 4, to mileage based numbering by 2020. Italics denote future exit numbers.|$|E
5|$|In October 2000, {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} announced the road would be switching from <b>sequential</b> exit numbering to distance-based exit numbering. At first, both exit numbers would exist, {{but the old}} numbers would be phased out. Work began on posting the new exit numbers in 2001.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, 1967, Mueller {{published}} an official Apollo mission numbering scheme, using <b>sequential</b> numbers for all flights, manned or unmanned. The sequence would start with Apollo 4 {{to cover the}} first three unmanned flights while retiring the Apollo 1 designation to honor the crew, per their widows' wishes.|$|E
5|$|Some teleost {{species are}} hermaphroditic, which {{can come in}} two forms: {{simultaneous}} and <b>sequential.</b> In the former, both spermatozoa and eggs {{are present in the}} gonads. Simultaneous hermaphroditism typically occurs in species that live in the ocean depths, where potential mates are sparsely dispersed. Self-fertilisation is rare and has only been recorded in two species, Kryptolebias marmoratus and Kryptolebias hermaphroditus. With <b>sequential</b> hermaphroditism, individuals may function as one sex early in their adult life and switch later in life. Species with this condition include parrotfish, wrasses, sea basses, flatheads, sea breams and lightfishes.|$|E
5|$|The BSAC'88 Tables use {{a series}} of seven tables, {{labelled}} A to G, {{to take into account}} the variation in ingassing and outgassing rates assumed for <b>sequential</b> dives.|$|E
5|$|The MFR named storms from a <b>sequential</b> list {{provided}} by the nation of Seychelles, beginning with Antoinette. In addition to the named storms in the year, the list included Maryse, Nelda, Ocline, Phyllis, Rolina, Sheryl, Thelma, Venyda, Wiltina, and Yolette.|$|E
5|$|The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW—Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) kept {{separate}} Knight's Cross lists, one {{for each}} of the three military branches, Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air force) and for the Waffen-SS. Within each of these lists a unique <b>sequential</b> number was assigned to each recipient. The same numbering paradigm was applied to the higher grades of the Knight's Cross, one list per grade. The recipients are ordered chronologically and numbered by the official <b>sequential</b> number assigned by the OKW. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves was awarded.|$|E

The <b>sequential</b> numbers greater than 143 for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords are unofficial and were assigned by the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR) and are therefore denoted in parentheses. The recipients are ordered chronologically and numbered by the official <b>sequential</b> number assigned by the OKW. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves was awarded.|$|E
25|$|The lunar year series repeats after 12 lunations or 354 days (Shifting {{back about}} 10 days in <b>sequential</b> years). Because {{of the date}} shift, the Earth's shadow will be about 11 degrees west in <b>sequential</b> events.|$|E
25|$|NAND sacrifices the random-access and execute-in-place {{advantages}} of NOR. NAND is {{best suited to}} systems requiring high capacity data storage. It offers higher densities, larger capacities, and lower cost. It has faster erases, <b>sequential</b> writes, and <b>sequential</b> reads.|$|E
25|$|In case A is separable, A has a <b>sequential</b> {{approximate}} identity. More generally, A {{will have}} a <b>sequential</b> approximate identity {{if and only if}} A contains a strictly positive element, i.e. a positive element h such that hAh is dense in A.|$|E
25|$|If the {{requested}} column address {{is at the}} start of a block, both burst modes (<b>sequential</b> and interleaved) return data in the same <b>sequential</b> sequence 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7. The difference only matters if fetching a cache line from memory in critical-word-first order.|$|E
25|$|This IPL {{concept is}} device independent. It {{is capable of}} IPL-ing from a card deck, from a {{magnetic}} tape, or from a hard disk. For this purpose, the normal X'02' command, which is simulated by the CPU, is taken to be a standard <b>sequential</b> read command on card and tape media (which are inherently <b>sequential</b> access in nature), but a special Read-IPL command on hard disks (which are inherently random access in nature; hard disks use a related, but different, read-type command, X'06', and others, for <b>sequential,</b> non-IPL reads).|$|E
25|$|This is <b>sequential</b> continuity, due to Eduard Heine.|$|E
25|$|Fortran <b>sequential</b> {{unformatted}} files {{created with}} one endianness usually cannot be read {{on a system}} using the other endianness because Fortran usually implements a record (defined as the data written by a single Fortran statement) as data preceded and succeeded by count fields, which are integers equal {{to the number of}} bytes in the data. An attempt to read such file on a system of the other endianness then results in a run-time error, because the count fields are incorrect. This problem can be avoided by writing out <b>sequential</b> binary files as opposed to <b>sequential</b> unformatted.|$|E

25|$|Twin-turbo or {{bi-turbo}} designs {{have two}} separate turbochargers operating {{in either a}} sequence or in parallel. In a parallel configuration, both turbochargers are fed one-half of the engine’s exhaust. In a <b>sequential</b> setup one turbocharger runs at low speeds and the second turns on at a predetermined engine speed or load. <b>Sequential</b> turbochargers further reduce turbo lag, but require an intricate set of pipes to properly feed both turbochargers.|$|E
