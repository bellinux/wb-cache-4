5|$|The {{investigation}} {{found that the}} level gauge had stuck at random times after a tank service in August 2005, {{but it did not}} concern maintenance contractors or site management. The independent <b>shut-off</b> <b>switch</b> was not fitted with a critical padlock to allow its check lever to work. Secondary containment (meant to trap the petrol in a retaining wall around the tank) failed and allowed petrol to flow out. Tertiary containment (drains and catchment areas to prevent release of spilled chemicals to the environment) also failed, and fuel and firefighting foam entered groundwater supplies. The {{investigation found}} secondary and tertiary containment to be inadequately designed and poorly maintained.|$|E
500|$|The {{final report}} of the Major Incident Investigation Board (MIIB) was written in 2008 and {{released}} in February 2011. The investigation found that Tank 912 at the Buncefield oil storage depot was being filled with petrol. The tank had a level gauge that employees used to monitor the level manually, and an independent high-level switch which would shut off inflow if the level got above a certain setpoint. On Tank 912, the manual gauge was stuck and the independent <b>shut-off</b> <b>switch</b> was inoperative, meaning that the tank was being [...] "filled blind" [...] with petrol (i.e., being filled without {{a clear indication of}} the level). Eventually Tank 912 filled up completely, the petrol overflowed through vents at the top, and formed a vapour cloud near ground level, which ignited and exploded. The fires from the explosion then lasted for five days.|$|E
50|$|While the {{national}} anthem was playing {{before the start of}} the game, hundreds of children began getting onto an escalator that traveled from the lower deck to the upper deck on the stadium's third base side. Unfortunately, while three or four children at a time were getting on the escalator at the bottom, the top of the escalator was partially blocked by a narrow metal gate that allowed only one person to pass through. The mass of children was thus blocked at the top, and children began falling back on top of one another in a crush of bodies as other children continued to get on at the bottom and as the jagged metal steps of the escalator continued to move beneath all of them. The moving steps cut and mutilated the children until a stadium usher, 65-year-old Melville Gibson, finally reached the escalator's emergency <b>shut-off</b> <b>switch</b> and turned the escalator off. Previously, the <b>shut-off</b> <b>switch</b> had been moved to a wall across from the escalator in order to prevent pranksters from turning it off while people were on it.|$|E
2500|$|The report {{went on to}} {{note that}} the fire {{extinguisher}} handles had been manually deployed by the crew before the fuel <b>shut-off</b> <b>switches.</b> The fire extinguisher handles also have the effect of cutting off power to the fuel switches, meaning that the fuel may continue to flow – a potentially dangerous situation. The report restated a previous Boeing Service Bulletin giving procedural advice that fuel switches should be operated before fire handles. It went on: [...] "This was not causal to the accident but could have had serious consequences {{in the event of a}} fire during the evacuation." ...|$|R
5000|$|Photographic {{materials}} {{should always}} be covered when not in use. Storing film-based materials in containers and boxes will keep light away from the materials. When exhibiting or using these materials, a low light level should be used. The installation of low-UV-emitting bulbs or UV-absorbing fluorescent bulb sleeves can help eliminate this problem. UV filtering window glazing or the installation of window shades may also help. Low- UV-emitting bulbs and sleeves are available from several manufacturers. Light levels in storage areas can also be controlled {{by the use of}} timed <b>shut-off</b> <b>switches.</b> Dark cloths or sheets of folder stock (heavyweight paper) or mat board should be available in reading rooms for covering objects when not in use by readers.|$|R

50|$|This often {{occurs in}} {{conjunction}} with the powertrain computer reducing available engine torque by electronically limiting throttle application and/or fuel delivery, retarding ignition spark, completely shutting down engine cylinders, {{and a number of other}} methods, depending on the vehicle and how much technology is used to control the engine and transmission. There are instances when traction control is undesirable, such as trying to get a vehicle unstuck in snow or mud. Allowing one wheel to spin can propel a vehicle forward enough to get it unstuck, whereas both wheels applying a limited amount of power will not produce the same effect. Many vehicles have a traction control <b>shut-off</b> <b>switch</b> for such circumstances.|$|E

500|$|Scharnhorst did {{not make}} the voyage unscathed, however; at 15:31 she struck an air-dropped {{magnetic}} mine in the mouth of the Scheldt, abreast of the forward superfiring turret. The blast damaged the ship's circuit breakers and knocked out her electrical system for 20minutes. The explosive shock caused serious damage; turret Bruno was jammed, as were the twin and single 15cm mounts on the port side. The blast also damaged the fuel oil pumps and the bearings in the turbo-generators, which brought the ship to a halt. The power outage disabled the emergency <b>shut-off</b> <b>switches</b> to the boilers and turbines, which could not be turned off until power was restored. The explosion tore a large gash {{in the side of the}} hull and allowed [...] of water into the ship, flooding 30 watertight spaces within five main watertight compartments. Scharnhorst took on a list of one degree and was down by the bows by a meter.|$|R
50|$|A monster truck show usually {{involves}} the trucks racing {{each other in}} a 2v2 competition and then letting it all hang out in a 'freestyle comp where the trucks do numerous stunts such as backflips and wheelies in numerous competitions. These events usually consist of racing, freestyle, donut competitions and wheelie competitions. These trucks can run up and over most man-made barriers, so they are equipped with remote <b>shut-off</b> <b>switches,</b> called the Remote Ignition Interrupter (RII), to help prevent an accident if the driver loses control at any time. The RII works with the truck's computer to allow track officials to shut the truck's engine off in the event the brakes fail or the truck becomes uncontrollable. During freestyle events, only one truck is allowed on the course at a time to ensure safety for both the drivers and fans. Most racing competitions feature two drivers racing each other on symmetrical tracks, with the losing driver being eliminated in a single loss elimination fashion.|$|R

5000|$|The away team {{finds that}} the request for medical {{assistance}} was made by Kareen without Graves' knowledge, and though resentful, he allows Selar to examine him. Selar determines that Graves has Darnay's disease, an incurable terminal disease and has only three weeks to live, so the team begins to collect Graves' research and records to preserve them after his death. Graves recognizes Data as Noonien Soong's creation, and claims he taught Soong everything he knew, which he asserts that if Soong is considered Data's [...] "father" [...] would make Graves his [...] "grandfather". Graves and Data begin to spend significant time alone together, during which Graves reveals that he has developed a method to transfer his consciousness to a computer, allowing him to live indefinitely. Data in turn reveals {{that he has a}} <b>shut-off</b> <b>switch,</b> which he says could be used to precipitate his own version of death.|$|E
50|$|A basic halogen oven {{features}} a heating chamber {{consisting of a}} clear glass bowl with a removable glass lid to which the heating assembly is secured. Inside the heating chamber, multi-level metal racks are used to elevate the contents during the cooking process. Within the heating assembly are the circular halogen lamp, a fan, and the controls for the oven which frequently include an automatic shut-off timer and a temperature control interface. On a basic model, the heating assembly has a handle to allow users to safely lift the lid off the unit. More elaborate models have a hinged lid mounted on an adjustable rear support which can be raised to accommodate an extension ring. This raises the heating assembly to reduce the grilling effect as well as increasing {{the volume of the}} oven. Hinged models are safer and easier to use. A safety <b>shut-off</b> <b>switch</b> turns off the lamp when the lid is raised during operation. The glass bowl is positioned in a stand which raises the bowl off the table-top and decreases the transfer of heat to the surrounding surfaces. Handles are often incorporated into the stand to allow for users to move the unit, providing safety especially during or after operation.|$|E

General Motors was aware of this potential problem, and held meetings about it, as early as 2005.|$|R
5000|$|Steel Spider {{appears in}} the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon series, voiced by Jason Marsden in a Boston accent. This version of Ollie Osnick is a teenage genius from Boston and a great fan of Spider-Man that endorses the web-slinger's {{transfer}} to his hometown which he does {{with the support of}} the Mayor of Boston. In the episode [...] "Spidah-Man", he becomes upset after Spider-Man rejects his offer to be a sidekick (known as Webby) since it would've been too dangerous for him. As a result, Ollie armors up some low-level criminals that Spider-Man had recently captured as the Boston Terroriers: a bank robber becomes Plymouth Rocker (voiced by Maurice LaMarche), a female museum thief becomes Salem's Witch (voiced by Misty Lee), and a purse snatcher becomes Slam Adams (voiced by Jeff Bennett) and he himself personally attacks as the Steel Spider (via a high-tech suit of armor). After Steel Spider fights Spider-Man but realizes this being a mistake, the Boston Terroriers then turn against Steel Spider upon hearing about J. Jonah Jameson's reward for Spider-Man's unmasking. Steel Spider realizes the error of his ways and teams up with Spider-Man against the villains. Spider-Man and Steel Spider end up hitting the <b>shut-off</b> <b>switches</b> on the Boston Terroriers' armors. In the end, Spider-Man returns to New York City while Steel Spider becomes Boston's own superhero.|$|R
40|$|Taiwan {{located at}} circum-Pacific seismic belt and the {{junction}} of the Eurasian plate and Philippine Sea plate. In average, more than 4000 earthquakes occurred annually. However, with today's science and technology, the earthquake is still unable to estimate and evacuate the people in advance. As the source of seismic waves generated {{in the body of}} the earth, when the wave passes on the mantle through various distinct characteristics of the media, the wave velocity varied. The seismic waves can be divided into two kinds, P-waves and S-waves. The velocity of P-wave is about 5 - 7 (km / sec); the velocity of destructive S-wave is about 3 - 4 (km / sec). This research develops the on-site Earthquake Early Warning System (EEWS) by the physical characteristics of the P-wave velocity greater than S-wave velocity. The on-site EEWS only used the signal from the on-site sensor, the calculation time was less and suitable to provide earthquake early warning to the region which close to the epicenter. In the same time, the proposed on-site EEWS was integrated with the disaster reduction control system in a demonstration house and been tested on NCREE’s shake table. The integrated on-site EEWS can provide the early earthquake warning through broadcast, TV and LED text display. Also, it will automatically park the elevator, <b>shut-off</b> the gas, <b>switch</b> the power, open the door and turn on the light of the escape route. Combine the on-site EEWS and disaster reduction control system, the life and economic loss can be greatly reduced. In the other hand, the on-site, long-term test results were also preceded. According to the validation test results, the proposed on-site EEWS can provide about 80 % accuracy of the predicted intensity levels and at least 8 seconds response time around the epicenter region...|$|R
