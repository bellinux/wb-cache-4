5|$|The International <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quantities</b> (ISQ) is {{a system}} based on seven base quantities: length, mass, time, {{electric}} current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity. Other quantities such as area, pressure, and electrical resistance are derived from these base quantities by clear non-contradictory equations. The ISQ defines the quantities that are measured with the SI units. The ISQ is defined in the international standard ISO/IEC 80000, and was finalised in 2009 {{with the publication of}} ISO 80000-1.|$|E

Older field emission literature (and papers that directly copy equations from old literature) often write some equations using an older equation system that does not use the quantity ε0. In this article, all such equations have been converted to modern international form. For clarity, this should always be done.|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} paper is to provide a torsor theory <b>of</b> physical <b>quantities</b> and basic operations thereon. Torsors are introduced in a bottom-up fashion as actions of scale transformation groups on spaces <b>of</b> unitized <b>quantities.</b> In contrast, the shortcomings of other accounts <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> that proceed in a top-down axiomatic manner are also discussed. In this paper, quantities are presented as dual counterparts of physical states. States serve as truth-makers of metrological statements about quantity values and are crucial in specifying alternative measurement units for base quantities. For illustration and ease of presentation, the classical notions of length, time, and instantaneous velocity are used as primordial examples. It is shown how torsors provide an effective description of the structure <b>of</b> <b>quantities,</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>quantities,</b> and transformations between them. Using the torsor framework, time-dependent quantities and their unitized derivatives are also investigated. Lastly, the torsor apparatus is applied to deterministic measurement <b>of</b> <b>quantities...</b>|$|R
