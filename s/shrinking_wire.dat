The short intra-block wires {{are close to the}} substrate and thought to have good thermal radiation characteristic, however, we reveal that the self-heating of short wires will be more significantly than that of global wires, and it can cause a reliability and performance degradation in the future. The max temperature rise from the ambient temperature becomes 27. 3 ◦ C in a 14 nm process. Our attribution analysis also clarifies that <b>shrinking</b> <b>wire</b> cross-sectional area as well as low-k material and increased power dissipation deteriorates self-heating.

In this white paper, we discuss the various trends exacerbating EM and IR-drop effects as well as design and analysis techniques to avoid them, and introduce Synopsys’ transistor-level analysis solution, which includes CustomSim ™ for FastSPICE circuit simulation, StarRC™ for extraction, and Galaxy Custom Designer ® for custom layout. Nanometer Technology Trends What general technology trends are contributing to the significance of EM and IR-drop effects in modern IC designs? Figure 1 provides examples of three distinct trends. Firstly, driven by Moore’s law, metal interconnect widths are decreasing exponentially. As a result, the overall cross-sectional area of interconnect is shrinking. Secondly, with increasing integration of functionality and passive devices the total interconnect length is exploding as well, which means {{that there are more}} wires on a die that are susceptible to EM effects. Finally, currents are not scaling proportionally to <b>shrinking</b> <b>wire</b> widths and, therefore, modern ICs have extremely high current densities...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Wires</b> <b>shrink</b> less {{efficiently}} than transistors. Smaller dimensions increase relative delay and {{the probability of}} crosstalk. Solutions to this problem include adding additional latency with pipelining, using “fat wires ” at higher metal levels, and advances in process and material technology. We propose a stopgap {{solution to this problem}} by applying a decade old technique called bus-expanding to the problem. By exploiting low spatial and temporal entropy of data it is possible to transfer   bits of data over a ¡-bit wide bus in a single cycle (  £ ¢ ¡). High entropy data will be routed directly over the bus while low entropy data will be compacted using small lookup tables. A table index will be transferred {{in the case of a}} successful lookup, otherwise the full value will be transferred in several cycles. Reducing the number of wires per bus, enables the use of wider wires, which in turn reduces the wire delay. Examination of projected process technologies shows that by shrinking the number of bits in a bus (64 ¤ 48) instead of <b>shrinking</b> the individual <b>wires</b> maintains a constant wire delay. Tests on SPEC CPU 2000 have shown that for the 64 -bit buses leading from the L 1 caches to the processor core it is possible to transfer all data types (addresses, integers, instructions and floating-points) using 40 -bits per bus on the average.

40|$|Current {{processor}} designs use additional transistors to add functionality that improves performance. These features tend {{to exploit}} instruction level parallelism. However, {{a point of}} diminishing returns has been reached in this effort. Instead, these additional transistors {{could be used to}} take advantage of thread level parallelism (TLP). This type of parallelism focuses on hundreds of instructions, rather than single instructions, executing in parallel. Additionally, as transistor sizes <b>shrink,</b> the <b>wires</b> on a chip become thinner. Fabricating a thinner wire means increasing the resistance and thus, the latency of that wire. In fact, in the near future, a signal may not reach a portion of the chip in a single clock cycle. So, in future designs, it will be important to limit the length of the wires on a chip. The SCMP parallel computer is a new architecture that is made up of small processing elements, called nodes, which are connected in a 2 -D mesh with nearest neighbor connections. Nodes communicate with one another, via message passing, through a network, which uses dimension order worm-hole routing. To support TLP, each node i...|$|R
40|$|Chip Multi-Processor (CMP) {{architectures}} {{have become}} mainstream for designing processors. With {{a large number}} of cores, Network-On-Chip (NOC) provides a scalable communication method for CMP architectures. NOC must be carefully designed to meet constraints of power and area, and provide ultra low latencies and high throughput. In this research, we explore different techniques to design high performance NOC. First, existing NOCs mostly use Dimension Order Routing (DOR) to determine the route taken by a packet in unicast traffic. However, with the development of diverse applications in CMPs, one-to-many (multicast) and one-to-all (broadcast) traffic are becoming more common. Current unicast routing cannot support multi-cast and broadcast traffic efficiently. We propose Recursive Partitioning Multicast (RPM) routing and a detailed multicast wormhole router design for NOCs. RPM allows routers to select intermediate replication nodes based on the global distribution of destination nodes. This provides more path diversities, thus achieves more bandwidth-efficiency and finally improves the performance of the whole network. Second, as feature size is <b>shrinking,</b> <b>wires</b> are becoming abundant resources available in NOC. Since NOC can benefit from high wire density due to no limits on the number of pins and faster signaling rates, it is very critical in the NOC router design to find a way that fully utilizes the wire resources to provide high performance. We propose an Adaptive Physical Channel Regulator (APCR) for NOC routers to exploit huge wiring resources. The flit size in an APCR router is less than the physical channel width (phit size) to provide finer granularity flow control. An APCR router allows flits from different packets or flows to share the same physical channel in a single cycle. The three regulation schemes (Monopolizing, Fair-sharing and Channel-stealing) intelligently allocate the output channel resources considering not only the availability of physical channels but the occupancy of input buffers. In an APCR router, each Virtual Channel can forward a dynamic number of flits every cycle depending on the run-time network status. Third, nanophotonics has been proposed to design low latency and high band- width NOC for future CMPs. Recent nanophotonic NOC designs adopt the token- based arbitration coupled with credit-based flow control, which leads to low band- width utilization. We propose two handshake schemes for nanophotonic interconnects in CMPs, Global Handshake (GHS) and Distributed Handshake (DHS), which get rid of the traditional credit-based flow control, reduce the average token waiting time, and finally improve the network throughput. Furthermore, we enhance the basic handshake schemes with setaside buffer and circulation techniques to overcome the Head-Of-Line (HOL) blocking...|$|R

40|$|A smart {{repeater}} {{is proposed}} for driving capacitively-coupled, global-length on-chip interconnects that alters its drive strength dynamically {{to match the}} relative bit pattern on the wires and thus the effective capacitive load.

In a UMC 0. 18 -mum technology the potential energy saving is around 10 % and the reduction in jitter 20 %, in comparison to a traditional repeater for typical global wire lengths. It is also shown that the average energy saving for nanometer technologies is {{in the range of}} 20 % to 25 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT FPGAs are {{characterized}} by a programmable interconnect that contains highly resistive and capacitive elements. While the configurable structure of the interconnect allows {{for the implementation of}} arbitrary circuits, it has also become a significant bottleneck for high-speed circuits. Even if {{there are only a few}} signal paths that run along long stretches of interconnect, it is these paths that may determine the maximum operating frequency of the circuit. In this paper we investigate architectural features that could allow us to automatically pipeline the delay associated with long routes without an excessive area penalty. The goal is to reschedule circuit operations in such a way that a signal may use multiple clock cycles to traverse a long route, rather than requiring a single long clock period. This rescheduling would not effect the timing of the visible outputs (no latency is added to the overall system). Specifically, we analyze the effects of adding a small number of registered routing switches to an FPGA architecture with segmented routing resources. A parameterized FPGA architecture is studied where the percentage of registered routing switches is varied and the speed improvement and area penalty is evaluated. Novel algorithms are presented that allow a circuit to best utilize an architecture with a given percentage of registered switches. We believe that this is the first study that attempts to evauate the tradeoffs associated with switches required in FPGA architectures. Our experiments indicate that the architectural features introduced can produce significant speedup for high speed circuits without excessive area costs. We believe that these techniques will become increasingly important in the future as deep sub-micron process technologies <b>shrink,</b> and <b>wire</b> delays become even more significant...|$|R

40|$|Many {{designers}} expect processor {{performance to}} keep improving {{at the current}} rate indefinitely as feature sizes <b>shrink.</b> However, as <b>wire</b> delays become {{a larger percentage of}} overall signal delay and as clock speeds grow faster than transistor speed, I believe performance increases will ultimately fall off. These delays are inevitable simply because wires are not keeping pace with the scaling of other features. In fact, for CMOS processes below 0. 25 micron, the physical limits of wire scaling 1 may begin to change high-speed processor design. That is, an unacceptably small percentage of the die will be reachable during a single clock cycle. To support my prediction, I have mapped trends in a metric that relates time and distance and projections in clock speed across eight processor generations, from 0. 6 to 0. 06 micron. During this span (probably 0. 1 micton) we'll see a billion transistor processor.

40|$|As {{semiconductor}} manufacturing processes scale to {{smaller and smaller}} feature sizes, manufacturing fault and permanent component failure are challenging how systems are traditionally designed. Historically, a combination of careful process tuning and design rule specification has been sufficient to cost-effectively ensure that deterministic design practices eventually result in acceptable system yield and lifetime.

This research is focused on the design-time system-level architectural optimization of cost, lifetime and yield in embedded network-on-chip-based multi-processor-systems-on-chip (NoC-based MPSoCs).

40|$|For {{nanotechnology}} nodes, {{the feature}} size is <b>shrunk</b> rapidly, the <b>wire</b> becomes narrow and thin, {{it leads to}} high RC parasitic, especially for resistance. The overall system performance are dominated by interconnect rather than device. As such, {{it is imperative to}} accurately measure and model interconnect parasitic in order to predict interconnect performance on silicon. Despite many test structures developed in the past to characterize device models and layout effects, only few of them are available for interconnects. Nevertheless, they are either not suitable for real chip implementation or too complicated to be embedded. A compact yet comprehensive test structure to capture all interconnect parasitic in a real chip is needed. To address this problem, this paper describes a set of test structures {{that can be used to}} study the timing performance (i. e. propagation delay and crosstalk) of various interconnect configurations. Moreover, an empirical model is developed to estimate the actual RC parasitic. Compared with the state-of-the-art interconnect test structures, the new structure is compact in size and can be easily embedded on die as a parasitic variation monitor. We have validated the proposed structure on a test chip in TSMC 28 nm HPM process.

However, further miniaturization of circuit elements {{is creating a}} bandwidth problem as chip interconnect <b>wires</b> <b>shrink</b> as well. A potential solution {{is the creation of}} an on-chip optical network with low delays that would be impossible to achieve using metal buses. However, this technology requires integrating optics with silicon microelectronics. The lack of efficient silicon optical sources has stymied efforts of an all-Si optical platform. Instead, the integration of efficient emitter materials, such as III-V semiconductors, with Si photonic structures is a low-cost, CMOS-compatible alternative platform. This thesis focuses on making and measuring on-chip photonic structures suitable for on-chip optical networking. The first part of the thesis assesses processing techniques of silicon and other semiconductor materials.

40|$|As {{technology}} scales, interconnect planning {{has been}} widely {{regarded as one of}} the most critical factors in determining the system performance and total power consumption. As the result of <b>shrinking</b> dimension, on-chip <b>wires</b> are getting more resistive, and the delay is becoming larger comparing to gate delay. On the other hand, the self capacitance of wires does not scale with feature size, and as wiring density grows, the total coupling capacitance increases, which results in substantial increment of interconnect power consumption. Meanwhile, off-chip interconnect is also becoming a limiting factor for system performance since the growth of chip's I/O bandwidth has been outpaced by the growth of communication. To meet the performance challenge, the per- pin interconnect bandwidth must be further improved with given power budget. For on-chip interconnect, buffer insertion has been adopted to reduce the signal delay. However, the added buffers require extra power consumption and increase routing complexity. In this dissertation, we investigate a set of interconnect performance metrics, optimize the repeated on-chip wires under different design goals and compare the performance metrics of optimum results. The quantitative delay-energy trade-offs for different design goals are demonstrated. Even with repeaters, nominal on-chip global wires still can not keep up with the pace of gate scaling. We propose a high speed signaling scheme using transmission line properties to address the performance issue. The transmission line allows the signal to travel at the speed of light in the medium. The signal toggles as wave instead of enforced electronic charges and thus saves power. However, the inter-symbol interference (ISI) limits the communication bandwidth. We use passive compensation to alleviate the ISI and develop an optimization flow for a given technology and wire dimension. We compare the nominal repeated wires with the transmission lines under different design goals. For off-chip serial links, we propose a set of passive equalization schemes to enhance the performance with low power consumption. We apply the schemes to the CPU-memory links using IBM POWER 6 system as a test vehicle. An optimization flow is devised to optimize the parameters of the equalizers. We derive the performance improvement and power consumption of the proposed schemes. We also demonstrate the sensitivities to the variations of RLC parameters and nois...|$|R

Over the past 40 years, {{the semiconductor industry}} has witnessed the exponential growth trend in system complexity as predicted by Moore’s law, facilitated by continuously <b>shrinking</b> transistor and <b>wire</b> dimensions. Three dimensional (3 D) circuit technology, with multiple tiers of active devices stacked above each other, is a key approach to achieve increasing levels of integration and performance in the future. Concomitant with exponentially reducing device dimensions, designers face new challenges in maximizing computation while remaining with a stringent power envelope. Over the last decade, multicore processors have emerged as a potential solution {{to address some of}} these problems by integrating multiple smaller and more energy efficient cores in order to replace a single, larger core. These cores must communicate through an efficient onchip interconnection network, by ideas such as networks-on-chips (NoCs), and NoC design is vital to both performance and power. This thesis presents solutions to the challenges in on-chip interconnect, more specifically, the on-chip communication and power delivery network of 3 D and multicore chips. The first part of this thesis focuses on developing techniques for designing efficient and high-performance NoC architecture for 3 D and multicore chips. Depending {{on the nature of the}} application, the multicore system may be either a System-on-Chip (SoC), which executes a relatively well-characterized workload, or a Chip multiprocessor (CMP), which is a general purpose processor that should be capable of handling a variety of workloads. For SoCs, this thesis presents an efficient algorithm to synthesize application-specific NoC architectures in a 3 D environment. We demonstrate that this method finds greatly improved solutions compared to a baseline algorithm reflecting prior work. We also study the impact of various factors on the network performance in 3 D NoCs, including the through-silicon via (TSV) count and the number of 3 D tiers. For CMPs, we observe that voltage and frequency scaling (VFS) for NoC can potentially reduce energy consumption, but the associated increase in latency and degradation in throughput limits its deployment. Therefore, we propose flexible-pipeline routers that reconfigure pipeline stages upon VFS, so that latency through such routers remains constant. With minimal hardware overhead, the deployment of such routers allows us to reduce network frequency and save network energy, without significant performance degradation. The second part of this thesis is concerned with the design and optimization of power delivery network for 3 D and multicore chips. First, we propose a novel paradigm where we exploit a new type of capacitor, the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor, together with the traditional CMOS decaps, to optimize the power supply noise in 3 D chips. Experimental results show that power grid noise can be more effectively optimized after the introduction of MIM decaps, with lower leakage power and little increase in the routing congestion, as compared to a solution using CMOS decaps only. Second, we explore the design and optimization of on-chip switched-capacitor (SC) DCDC converters for multicore processors. On one hand, with an accurate power grid simulator, we find that distributed design of SC converters can reduce the IR drop significantly compared to the lumped design, with improved supply voltage. On the other hand, the efficiency of the power delivery system using SC converters is a major concern, but this has not been addressed at the system level in prior research. We develop models for the efficiency of such a system as a function of size and layout of the SC converters, and propose an approach to minimize power loss by optimizing the size and layout of the SC converters. The efficiency of these techniques is demonstrated on both homogenous and heterogenous multicore chips...|$|R
