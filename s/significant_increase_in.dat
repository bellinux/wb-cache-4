40|$|Using a radial {{immunodiffusion}} technique {{the levels}} of four serum pro-teins, albumin, transferrin, slow =a-globulinand =g-globulin, were measured in normal rats {{to determine the effects}} on these proteins of age, sex, preg-nancy and of the administration of oestrogen (mestranol) and progestogen(ethynodiol diacetate). <b>Significant</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> albumin, slow =a-globulin and =g-globulin were found with increasing age, and highly significant differences in albumin and slow =a-globulin occurred between male and female rats. During pregnancy <b>significant</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> slow =a-globulin and transferrin were found but albumin and =g-globulin concentrations fell. Oestrogen administration resulted <b>in</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> slow =a-globulin and transferrin, but albumin and =g-globulin were unaltered.

The early 20th century saw the development of new packing, storage and shipping technologies that improved the lifespan and transportability of lettuce and resulted in a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> availability. During the 1950s, lettuce production was revolutionized with the development of vacuum cooling, which allowed field cooling and packing of lettuce, replacing the previously used method of ice-cooling in packing houses outside the fields.|$|E
