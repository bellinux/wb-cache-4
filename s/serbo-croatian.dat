5|$|Films {{from the}} former Yugoslavia are written in both Latin and Cyrillic {{due to the fact}} that the {{previously}} official <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> language used both alphabets. Chinese film titles are romanized according to the pinyin system, and are written using the characters employed in their submitting country, i.e. traditional Chinese ones for films submitted by Hong Kong and Taiwan, and simplified Chinese ones for films submitted by the People's Republic of China.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the occupation, {{the most}} recent Yugoslav census had been taken in 1931. This census used {{language}} as the primary criterion, and counted all speakers of <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> as one group, rather than recognising distinct Serb, Croat, Bosnian Muslim, Macedonian and Montenegrin nationalities. Aligning data on religious affiliation with the linguistic data {{has been used by}} scholars to determine approximate numbers of Serbs and Croats in the 1931 census, by counting those of the Roman Catholic denomination as Croats.|$|E
5|$|SS-Standartenführer Karl von Krempler, a {{specialist}} in Islam who spoke <b>Serbo-Croatian,</b> was charged by Himmler and Phleps with organising the division. On 3 March 1943, Phleps met with von Krempler, who was to work with NDH government representative Dr. Alija Šuljak. The campaign began on 20 March 1943, when von Krempler and Šuljak began an 18-day recruiting tour through 11 Bosnian districts. In the meantime the Germans began raising the divisional headquarters staff in Berlin, including SS-Standartenführer der Reserve Herbert von Oberwurzer, who was transferred from the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord to command the division.|$|E
5|$|Elf-like beings {{appear to}} have been a common {{characteristic}} within Indo-European mythologies. In the Celtic-speaking regions of north-west Europe, the beings most similar to elves are generally referred to with the Gaelic term Aos Sí. The equivalent term in modern Welsh is Tylwyth Teg. In the Romance-speaking world, beings comparable to elves are widely known by words derived from Latin fata ('fate'), which came into English as fairy. This word became partly synonymous with elf by the early modern period. Other names also abound, however, such as the Sicilian Donas de fuera ('ladies from outside'), or French bonnes dames ('good ladies'). In the Finnic-speaking world, the term usually thought most closely equivalent to elf is haltija (in Finnish) or haldaja (Estonian). Meanwhile, an example of an equivalent in the Slavic-speaking world is the vila (plural vile) of <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> (and, partly, Slovene) folklore. Elves bear some resemblances to the satyrs of Greek mythology, who were also regarded as woodland-dwelling mischief-makers.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{newspapers}} Bosanski vjestnik, Bosna, and Sarajevski cvjetnik, the Vilayet Printing House published around fifty books and booklets in <b>Serbo-Croatian,</b> Ottoman Turkish, and Hebrew. While {{most of these}} publications were concerned with various Ottoman laws and legislation, the printing house also published a number of textbooks. The textbooks for Serb elementary schools in the vilayet were prepared by Miloš Mandić {{on the basis of}} those that were used in Serbia. These include an alphabet book (Буквар), a short Biblical history (Кратка свештена историја), a basal reader (Прва читанка), and the First Knowledges (Прва знања); they were published in 1867 and 1868. Mandić's alphabet book, the printing house's first textbook, was the second Serbian alphabet book using the reformed Serbian Cyrillic. The First Serbian Alphabet Book (Први Српски Буквар), authored by Vuk Karadžić, had been published in Vienna in 1827. The original plan was to print fifteen textbooks for Serb schools, ranging in subject from grammar, arithmetic, geography and religious teaching, but only four were printed. Although they were based on the textbooks used in Serbia, the vilayet's authorities made sure that every mention of Serbs and the Serbian language was erased from them.|$|E
5|$|Tesla read many works, memorizing {{complete}} books, {{and supposedly}} possessed a photographic memory. He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: <b>Serbo-Croatian,</b> Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. Tesla related {{in his autobiography}} that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing {{the name of an}} item, {{he would be able to}} envision it in realistic detail. Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.|$|E
5|$|The first {{newspaper}} {{to be published}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina was Bosanski vjestnik, a political-informative and educational weekly edited by Sopron and printed in Serbian Cyrillic. It had a pro-Serb inclination, though it generally promoted a unitary Bosnian nation, in accordance with the Ottoman policy in the province. The official gazette, the weekly Bosna, was primarily concerned with publishing and explaining laws, orders, and proclamations. Another weekly issued by the printing house was Sarajevski cvjetnik, which fiercely defended the Ottoman regime and polemicised with Serbian and Austrian newspapers that criticised it. Bosna and Sarajevski cvjetnik were bilingual, printed half in Ottoman Turkish and half in <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> in the Cyrillic script. The printing house produced a number of elementary school textbooks, including the second Serbian alphabet book using the reformed Serbian Cyrillic, following Vuk Karadžić's book published in Vienna in 1827. Other books include a collection of Bosnian Serb lyric folk poetry, an Ottoman Turkish grammar, and several Jewish religious books. The first printed exemplar of Bosnian Aljamiado literature was also published by the Vilayet Printing House. It produced around 50 books and booklets altogether, most of them being concerned with various Ottoman laws and legislation.|$|E
25|$|Two {{alphabet}}s used in Yugoslavia were: the Latin alphabet and the Cyrillic script. Both alphabets were modified {{for use by}} the <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> {{language in}} the 19th century, thus the <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> Latin alphabet is more closely known as Gaj's Latin alphabet, while Cyrillic {{is referred to as the}} Serbian Cyrillic alphabet. <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> uses both alphabets, Slovene uses only the Latin alphabet, and Macedonian uses only the Cyrillic alphabet. Bosnian and Croatian variants of the language used exclusively Latin, while the Serbian variant used both Latin and Cyrillic.|$|E
25|$|The most-commonly-spoken foreign {{languages}} in Berlin are Turkish, English, Russian, Arabic, Polish, Kurdish, <b>Serbo-Croatian,</b> Italian, Vietnamese, and French. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> are heard {{more often in}} the western part, due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. English, Vietnamese, Russian, and Polish have more native speakers in East Berlin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Serbo-Croatian</b> is a South Slavic {{language}} that has, {{like most other}} Slavic languages, an extensive system of inflection. This article describes exclusively the grammar of the Shtokavian dialect, which {{is a part of}} the South Slavic dialect continuum and the basis for the Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian standard variants of <b>Serbo-Croatian.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{three main}} {{languages}} all {{belong to the}} South Slavic language group and are thus similar, allowing most people from different areas to understand each other. Intellectuals were mostly acquainted with all three languages, while people of more modest means from SR Slovenia and SR Macedonia were provided {{an opportunity to learn}} the <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> language during the compulsory service in the federal military. <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> itself is made-up of three dialects, Shtokavian, Kajkavian, and Chakavian, with Shtokavian used as the standard official dialect of the language. Official <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> (Shtokavian), was divided into two similar variants, the Croatian (Western) variant and Serbian (Eastern) variant, with minor differences telling the two apart.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} {{number of people in}} Slovenia speak a variant of <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> (Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, or Montenegrin) as their native language. These are mostly immigrants who moved to Slovenia from other former Yugoslav republics from the 1960s to the late 1980s, and their descendants. In 2002, 0.4% of the Slovenian population declared themselves to be native speakers of Albanian and 0.2% native speakers of Macedonian. Czech, the fourth-largest minority language in Slovenia prior to World War II (after German, Hungarian, and <b>Serbo-Croatian),</b> is now the native language of a few hundred residents of Slovenia.|$|E

25|$|A former {{politician}} and leading Marxist theoretician, Djilas wrote a lengthy study of Njegoš's life {{and works in}} the late 1950s while serving a prison sentence after a row with Yugoslavia's communist leadership. The manuscript was smuggled out of the prison by Djilas' associates in the early 1960s and taken to the West, where it was edited, translated from the original <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> into English, and published under the title Njegoš: Poet, Prince, Bishop, in 1966. The book remains the only English-language biography of Njegoš, and the subsequent <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> edition (1988) is likely the most extensive study {{of his life in}} that language, as well. Djilas himself was a great admirer of Njegoš, and later recounted that Gorski vijenac was the only text that he always carried by his side during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|The name of {{the city}} in Hungarian (Bécs), <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> (Beč) and Ottoman Turkish (Beç) has a different, {{probably}} Slavonic origin, and originally referred to an Avar fort in the area. Slovene-speakers call the city Dunaj, which in other Central European Slavic languages means the Danube River, on which the city stands.|$|E
25|$|Serbs speak Serbian, {{a member}} of the South Slavic group of languages, {{specifically}} the Southwestern group. Standard Serbian is a standardized variety of <b>Serbo-Croatian,</b> and therefore mutually intelligible with Standard Croatian and Standard Bosnian (see Differences in standard Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian), which are all based on the Shtokavian dialect.|$|E
25|$|Eventual loss {{of length}} in final syllables in most languages. However, the former long vowels are {{reflected}} {{to some extent}} in Slovene and <b>Serbo-Croatian,</b> and more directly by the neo-circumflex accent in Slovene, which developed early on from former acute-register syllables when followed by a long syllable or internal yer.|$|E
25|$|Levý’s second monograph, The Art of Translation, is a {{fundamental}} opus on the translation of “artistic literature” (belles letters). It deals with the genesis and composition of a literary translation. It puts emphasis on the translation of poetry.

25|$|Four-way <b>Serbo-Croatian</b> system, {{also used}} in Slovenian and often in Slavic reconstructions: long rising (á), short rising (à), long falling (ȃ), short falling (ȁ).

25|$|The {{fourth group}} of dialects {{is often not}} {{considered}} a separate group, but a subgroup of Central and Western Slovak dialects (see e.g. Štolc, 1968), but it is currently undergoing changes due to contact with surrounding languages (<b>Serbo-Croatian,</b> Romanian, and Hungarian) and long-time geographical separation from Slovakia (see the studies in Zborník Spolku vojvodinských slovakistov, e.g. Dudok, 1993).|$|E
