50|$|In {{addition}} to disease caused by direct bacterial infection, some foodborne illnesses {{are caused by}} enterotoxins (exotoxins targeting the intestines).

This causes intense vomiting including or not including diarrhea (resulting in staphylococcal enteritis), and <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins</b> (most commonly staphylococcal enterotoxin A but also including staphylococcal enterotoxin B) are the most commonly reported enterotoxins although cases of poisoning are likely underestimated.

40|$|Staphylococcal {{foodborne}} intoxication, {{in which}} major symptoms are vomiting and diarrhoea, occurs after ingestion of thermostable <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins</b> produced in food by enterotoxigenic strains of coagulase-positive staphylococci. <b>Staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins</b> are normally not or only slightly inactivated during food processing, storage, distribution {{or during the}} preparation of the food in the kitchen.

Objective: To investigate the associations between <b>Staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxin</b> sensitization and asthma.

40|$|<b>Staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins</b> (SE) are exoproteins {{produced}} by Staphylococcus aureus {{that act as}} superantigens and have been implicated as {{a leading cause of}} food-borne disease and toxic shock. Little is known about how these molecules penetrate the gut lining and gain access to both local and systemic immune tissues. To model movement in vitro of <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins,</b> we have employed a monolayer system composed of crypt-like human colonic T- 84 cells. SEB and SEA showed comparable dose-dependent transcytosis in vitro, while toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST- 1) exhibited increased movement at lower doses. Synthetic peptides corresponding to specific regions of the SEB molecule were tested in vitro to identify the domain of the protein involved in the transcytosis of SE. A toxin peptide of particular interest contains the amino acid sequence KKKVTAQELD, which is highly conserved across all SE. At a toxin-to-peptide ratio of 1 : 10, movement of SEB across the monolayers was reduced by 85 %. Antisera made against the SEB peptide recognized native SEB and also inhibited SEB transcytosis. Finally, the conserved 10 -amino-acid peptide inhibited transcytosis of multiple <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins,</b> SEA, SEE, and TSST- 1. These data demonstrate that this region of the <b>staphylococcal</b> <b>enterotoxins</b> plays a distinct role in toxin movement across epithelial cells.

The gene, composed of 771 base pairs, encodes an enterotoxin A precursor of 257 amino acid residues.
