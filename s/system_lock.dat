40|$|Our goal is {{to support}} transaction-time {{functionality}} that enables the coexistence of ordinary, non-temporal tables with transaction-time tables. In such a system, each transaction updating a transaction-time or snapshot table must include a timestamp for its updated data that correctly reflects the serialization order of the transactions, including transactions on ordinary tables. A serious issue is coping with SQL CURRENT_TIME functions, which should return a time consistent with a transaction’s timestamp and serialization order. Prior timestamping techniques cannot support such functions with this desired semantics.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{bifurcated}} endoluminal prosthesis for transfemoral placement in the aortoiliac position with a large-animal model that would simulate human implantation. Methods: Fifteen calves (160 to 200 kg) underwent bilateral femoral artery exposure and transfemoral placement in the aortoiliac position of a bifurcated Dacron prosthesis, inserted through a 26 F sheath with an over-the-bifurcation guide wire to retrieve the contralateral limb and secured proximally and distally with self-expanding attachment systems. The preferred location was determined before implantation and compared with final implant location by caliper measurements and angiography. Events during implantation, maneuvers used to accomplish accurate deployment, and final results, as judged by angiography and clinical evaluation, were recorded. Four animals survived and were used for chronic evaluation and healing by gross and microscopic studies. Results: All grafts (n = 15) were patent at the end of the procedure. All (n = 7) noncrimped grafts had minor kinks in areas of curvature, whereas eight of eight crimped grafts (device modification) had none. Torque control of the body and individual limbs was necessary to correct twists before deployment in 10 of 15 grafts, with two greater than 30 -degree twists remaining, which did not appear to affect flow. One implant was entirely deployed in the aorta because of parallax error, subsequently avoided by use of a marker board placed dorsally. Three premature deployments occurred, corrected by attachment <b>system</b> <b>lock</b> modification. The mean final implant position was within 2. 9 ± 1. 4 mm (aortic), 1. 6 ± 1. 1 mm, and 1. 5 ± 0. 8 mm (contralateral and ipsilateral iliac limbs, respectively) of the intended position. Three of four animals intended for long-term evaluation were killed prematurely because of clinically evident spinal cord ischemia. Histologic sections at 2 weeks showed early wall repair without inflammatory cells and pannus ingrowth across the anastomosis. Conclusion: We conclude that implantation of a bifurcated endovascular prosthesis through the bilateral femoral approach is possible, provided the intended aortic implantation site (neck) is at least 12 mm in length (mean ± 2 SD each direction). Torque control of each portion of the device will be needed in the majority of instances, with attention to parallax effect necessary for optimal placement. This animal model is not suitable for chronic graft evaluation because of its sensitivity for spinal cord ischemia. Healing data suggest graft incorporation similar to that of a surgically placed prosthesis. (J VASC SURG 1995; 22 : 370 - 81. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{work was}} based on {{digitally}} controlled oscillator for an all-digital PLL in 65 nm process. Phase locked loop’s were used {{in most of the}} application for clock generation and recovery as well. As the technology grows faster in the existinggeneration, there has to be quick development with the technique. In such case ananalog PLL which was used earlier gradually getting converted to digital circuit. All-digital PLL blocks does the same work as an analog PLL blocks, but thecircuits and other control circuitry designed were completely in digital form, becausedigital circuit has many advantages over analog counterpart when they arecompared with each other. Digital circuit could be scaled down or scaled up evenafter the circuits were designed. It could be designed for low power supply voltageand easy to construct in a 65 nm process. The digital circuit was widely chosento make life easier. In most of the application PLL’s were used for clock and data recovery purpose,from that perspective jitter will stand as a huge problem for the designers. Themain aim of this thesis was to design a DCO that should bring down the jitter asdown as possible which was designed as standalone, the designed DCO would belater placed in an all-digital PLL. To understand the concept and problem aboutjitter at the early stage of the project, an analog PLL was designed in block leveland tested for different types of jitter and then design of a DCO was started. This document was about the design of a digitally controlled oscillator whichoperates with the center frequency of 2. 145 GHz. In the first stage of the projectthe LC tank with NMOS structure was built and tested. In the latter stage the LCtank was optimized by using PMOS structure as negative resistance and eventuallyended up with NMOS and PMOS cross coupled structure. Tuning banks were oneof the main design in this project which {{plays a key role in}} locking the system ifthe DCO is placed in an all-digital PLL system. So, three types of tuning bankswere introduced to make the <b>system</b> <b>lock</b> more precisely. The control circuits andthe varactors built were all digital and hence it is called as digitally controlledoscillator.

DCO and tuning banks were tested using different types of simulation and were tested for different jitter qualities and analysis.
