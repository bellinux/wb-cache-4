50|$|Active recent {{research}} on superhydrophobic materials might {{eventually lead to}} industrial applications. Some attempts at fabricating a superhydrophobic surface include mimicking a lotus leaf surface, namely the two-tiered characteristic. This requires micro-scale surfaces with typically nanoscale features on top of them. For example, a simple routine of coating cotton fabric with silica or titania particles by sol-gel technique has been reported, which protects the fabric from UV light and makes it superhydrophobic. Similarly, silica nanoparticles can be deposited on top of already hydrophobic carbon fabric. The carbon fabric by itself is identified as inherently hydrophobic, but not distinguished as superhydrophobic since its contact angle is not higher than 150°. With the adhesion of silica nanoparticles, contact angles as high as 162° are achieved. Using silica nano-particles is also of interest to develop transparent hydrophobic materials for car windshields and self-cleaning windows. By coating an already transparent surface with nano-silica with about 1 wt%, droplet contact angles can be raised up to 168° with a 12° <b>sliding</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of contact lines on inclined micropillared surfaces were investigated in this paper.

The dynamic deformation of contact lines would be more obvious under Wenzel state and Cassie impregnating state; however it is negligible when the droplet is in one-dimensional scenario. Droplet layers formed during droplet sliding were left behind and evaporated quickly and disappeared. Based on these characteristics, the comparison of experimental data with theoretical models was discussed. It was found that energy barrier {{played an important role}} in analyzing wetting characteristics. Because of ignoring the role of energy barrier, the model of <b>sliding</b> <b>angle</b> cannot predict the <b>sliding</b> <b>angle</b> on micropillared surfaces very well, especially when the area fraction is small.

40|$|We {{demonstrated}} a facile method to produce perfectly hydrophobic surfaces (advancing and receding angles both 180 degrees) via electrospraying. When a copolymer of styrene and a perfluoroacrylate monomer was electrosprayed in good solvents, surfaces composed of micrometer size beads were formed and fairly low threshold water <b>sliding</b> <b>angles</b> could be achieved. Addition of high boiling point poor solvents to the solutions resulted nanoscale roughness on the beads {{due to a}} possible phase separation that occurs in a predominantly poor solvent environment. However, <b>sliding</b> <b>angles</b> were not zero even on the nanoscale roughness dominated topographies achieved by this method. On the other hand, when the electrospraying process parameters were set such that micrometer size hills of nanoscopically rough beads were formed, 0 degrees <b>sliding</b> <b>angles</b> were measured. Videos of droplets recorded and the adhesive forces measured during a contact and release experiment revealed that these dual scale rough surfaces were indeed perfectly hydrophobic. Application of the method with other binary good solvent-poor solvent systems also resulted in perfect hydrophobicity.

40|$|Superhydrophobic surfaces, {{with water}} contact angles greater than 150 ° and <b>slide</b> <b>angles</b> less than 10 °, have {{attracted}} {{a great deal}} of attention due to their self-cleaning ability and excellent water-repellency. It is commonly accepted that a superhydrophobic surface loses its superhydrophobicity in contact with water hotter than 50 °C. Such a phenomenon was recently demonstrated by Liu et al. [J. Mater. Chem., 2009, 19, 5602], using both natural lotus leaf and artificial leaf-like surfaces. However, our work has shown that superhydrophobic surfaces maintained their superhydrophobicity, even in water at 80 °C, provided that the leaf temperature is greater than that of the water droplet. In this paper, we report on the wettability of water droplets on superhydrophobic thin films, as a function of both their temperatures. The results have shown that both the water contact and <b>slide</b> <b>angles</b> on the surfaces will remain unchanged when the temperature of the water droplet is greater than that of the surface. The water contact <b>angle,</b> or the <b>slide</b> <b>angle,</b> will decrease or increase, however, with droplet temperatures increasingly greater than that of the surfaces. We propose that, in such cases, the loss of superhydrophobicity of the surfaces is caused by evaporation of the hot water molecules and their condensation on the cooler surface. © 2014 the Partner Organisations...|$|R

A very low mass concentration of PFOTES (0. 1208 % wt.) increases the water contact angle of a coated sample from 11. 3 ° to 138 °.

50|$|Contact {{angle is}} a measure of static hydrophobicity, and contact <b>angle</b> {{hysteresis}} and <b>slide</b> <b>angle</b> are dynamic measures. Contact angle hysteresis is a phenomenon that characterizes surface heterogeneity. When a pipette injects a liquid onto a solid, the liquid will form some contact angle. As the pipette injects more liquid, the droplet will increase in volume, the contact angle will increase, but its three phase boundary will remain stationary until it suddenly advances outward. The contact angle the droplet had immediately before advancing outward is termed the advancing contact angle. The receding contact angle is now measured by pumping the liquid back out of the droplet. The droplet will decrease in volume, the contact angle will decrease, but its three phase boundary will remain stationary until it suddenly recedes inward. The contact angle the droplet had immediately before receding inward is termed the receding contact angle. The difference between advancing and receding contact angles is termed contact angle hysteresis and can be used to characterize surface heterogeneity, roughness, and mobility. Surfaces that are not homogeneous will have domains which impede motion of the contact line. The <b>slide</b> <b>angle</b> is another dynamic measure of hydrophobicity and is measured by depositing a droplet on a surface and tilting the surface until the droplet begins to slide. Liquids in the Cassie-Baxter state generally exhibit lower <b>slide</b> <b>angles</b> and contact angle hysteresis than those in the Wenzel state.|$|R

40|$|Artificial {{hydrophobic}} and superhydrophobic surfaces {{have been}} studied {{in the last ten}} years in an effort to understand the effects of structured micro- and nano- scale features on droplet motion and self-cleaning mechanisms. Among these structured surfaces, hybrid surfaces consisting of a combination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials have been designed, fabricated and characterized to understand how surface properties and morphology affect enhanced droplet growth rates and droplet shedding during condensation. However, use of hybrid surfaces in condensation leads to a strong pinning effect that takes place between the condensing droplets and the hydrophobic-hydrophillic edge, leading to a significant contact angle hysteresis effect. In an effort to circumvent the pinning effect, a vibration-induced droplet shedding method has been explored to overcome contact angle hysteresis and facilitate droplet shedding at lower rolling angles. To understand the effects of hybrid surface morphology and vibration modes on droplet removal from surfaces used for condensation, this research study focuses on the effects of acoustic-induced vibrations on droplet sliding at different inclined angles on hybrid surfaces. A hydrophilic surface (silicon surface) has been used as the baseline in the study to be able to uncover the effects of vibration on pinned droplets. Firstly, the relationship between <b>sliding</b> <b>angles</b> and droplet volume was investigated experimentally for hybrid surfaces with different spacings. Then, the effects of natural resonance frequencies of droplets with different volumes on different surfaces were also studied using a resonance model and a customized experimental setup. Acoustic-induced vibrations were then applied to the surfaces to understand the effects of single or multiple resonance frequencies on droplet <b>sliding</b> <b>angles.</b> Droplet vibration and roll-off processes were experimentally characterized using a high speed imaging system. An acoustic sensor was also used to measure the induced frequencies and amplitudes. Experimental results to date show that hybrid surfaces with larger spacing leads to lower droplet <b>sliding</b> <b>angles.</b> Furthermore, droplets under the influence of acoustic waves depict different contour morphologies when vibrating at different resonance frequencies. Moreover, droplet <b>sliding</b> <b>angles</b> can be reduced through vibration when the proper combination of droplet size and surface morphology is prescribed.
