25|$|The default GUI {{is based}} on Be API on BeOS, Cocoa for macOS, and Qt 4 for Linux and Windows, but all give a similar <b>standard</b> <b>interface.</b> The old default GUI was based on wxWidgets on Linux and Windows. VLC {{supports}} highly customizable skins through the skins2 interface, and also supports Winamp 2 and XMMS skins. Skins are not supported in the macOS version. VLC has ncurses, remote control, and telnet console interfaces. There is also an HTTP interface, as well as interfaces for mouse gestures and keyboard hotkeys.|$|E
25|$|Modern HDDs {{present a}} {{consistent}} interface {{to the rest}} of the computer, no matter what data encoding scheme is used internally. Typically a DSP in the electronics inside the HDD takes the raw analog voltages from the read head and uses PRML and Reedâ€“Solomon error correction to decode the sector boundaries and sector data, then sends that data out the <b>standard</b> <b>interface.</b> That DSP also watches the error rate detected by error detection and correction, and performs bad sector remapping, data collection for Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology, and other internal tasks.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in {{commercial}} aviation, both engine types will have a <b>standard</b> <b>interface</b> with the aircraft, allowing any 787 to be fitted with either a GE or Rolls-Royce engine at any time as long as the pylon is also modified. Engine interchangeability makes the 787 a more flexible asset to airlines, allowing them to change from one manufacturer's engine to the other's in light of any future engine developments which conform more closely to their operating profile. The cost of such a change would require a significant operating cost difference between the two engine types to make it economical - a difference that does not exist with the engines today.|$|E

25|$|The Java class {{libraries}} serve three purposes {{within the}} Java platform. First, like other standard code libraries, the Java libraries provide the programmer a well-known {{set of functions}} to perform common tasks, such as maintaining lists of items or performing complex string parsing. Second, the class libraries provide an abstract interface to tasks that would normally depend heavily on the hardware and operating system. Tasks such as network access and file access are often heavily intertwined with the distinctive implementations of each platform. The java.net and java.io libraries implement an abstraction layer in native OS code, then provide a <b>standard</b> <b>interface</b> for the Java applications to perform those tasks. Finally, when some underlying platform does not support all of the features a Java application expects, the class libraries work to gracefully handle the absent components, either by emulation to provide a substitute, or at least by providing a consistent way to check {{for the presence of}} a specific feature.|$|E

The excess length of the tube intrudes through the drum shell, and a large hole is required for this. Developed by Pearl, this mount has been adopted by many other manufacturers, and the 22mm tube has become a <b>standard</b> <b>interface</b> for many other mounts and stands, such as cymbal booms.|$|E
