5|$|During the war, Hammond {{spent much}} of his leave with Ness-Harvey in South Africa. In 1945, <b>she</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> back to England, but did not like it. When Hammond left to tour Australia in 1946–47, Ness-Harvey {{remained}} behind with his mother, with whom she did not get along. This was one of the factors which led to Hammond's problems on the tour. His divorce went through, and on his return, he and Sybil married at Kingston Register Office. She had already changed her name to Hammond by deed poll. Their first child, Roger, was born in 1948. Carolyn was born in 1950 and Valerie was born in 1952.|$|E

Giraud showed the strip to Pilotes editor, Rene Goscinny, who agreed to publish it (issue 335, 24 March 1966). This was followed by another collaboration titled Comment réussir en affaires en se donnant un mal fou (How to succeed in business by almost killing oneself through hard work) which was also published in Pilote (issue 351, 14 July 1966). By this stage Mézières visa was almost expired and so he used the money from these strips to pay for his ticket home. In leaving America, Mézières also left behind a young woman, Linda, one of Christin's students: <b>she</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> to France some months later and is now his wife.|$|E

25|$|At Ulfeldt's disgrace in 1651, <b>she</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> to Amsterdam and Stockholm. They became fugitives, often {{wandering}} {{about to}} elude capture. She sometimes spent weeks {{disguised as a}} man, once fending off arrest from Danish pursuers at gunpoint, and another time the caresses of an infatuated barmaid, the latter proving the more difficult escape. At her insistence, she shared Ulfeldt's exile and expeditions, while he engaged in intrigues with Denmark's enemies for some years, hoping either to return to Copenhagen in power or to humiliate those who held power there. Despite having been made Count of Sölvesborg in Sweden for treasonous services, he was discovered engaged in double treachery and, in 1659, imprisoned. His wife publicly defended him. They escaped separately to Copenhagen where he was promptly arrested, and she shared his harsh imprisonment in the castle Hammershus on the isle of Bornholm 1660-1661, until they ransomed themselves by deeding over most of their properties.|$|E

[...] Within a year, {{her husband}} was posted to India. <b>She</b> <b>followed</b> <b>him</b> there in January 1946, but she found life as the wife of {{an officer of the}} British Raj tedious, the social life dull, and the food {{generally}} [...] "frustrating".

In June 1946, she suffered severe sinusitis and was told by her doctors that the condition would persist if she remained in the summer heat of Delhi. Instead, she was advised to go back to England.

[...] She entered the room to find Tracy lying dead from a heart attack. He was 67.

Her younger brother had died of smallpox, and she too had had the disease. Determined to spare her five-year-old son Edward from similar suffering, she ordered the embassy surgeon Charles Maitland to variolate him. On her return to London, she asked Maitland to variolate her four-year-old daughter {{in the presence of the}} king's physicians. Later, Montagu persuaded the Prince and Princess of Wales to sponsor a public demonstration of the procedure. Six prisoners who had been condemned to death and were awaiting execution at Newgate Prison were offered a full pardon for serving as the subjects of the public experiment. They accepted and were variolated in 1721. All the prisoners recovered from the procedure. [...] To test its protective effect one of them, a nineteen-year-old woman, was ordered to sleep in the same bed as a ten-year-old smallpox victim for six weeks. She did not contract the disease.|$|E
