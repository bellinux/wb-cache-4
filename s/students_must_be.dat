5|$|Emphasis {{is placed}} not on actual {{arithmetic}} computation, {{but rather on}} conceptual understanding and interpretation. The course curriculum is organized around four basic themes; the first involves exploring data and covers 20–30% of the exam. Students are expected to use graphical and numerical techniques to analyze distributions of data, including univariate, bivariate, and categorical data. The second theme involves planning and conducting a study and covers 10–15% of the exam. <b>Students</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> aware of the various methods of data collection through sampling or experimentation and the sorts of conclusions that {{can be drawn from}} the results. The third theme involves probability and its role in anticipating patterns in distributions of data. This theme covers 20–30% of the exam. The fourth theme, which covers 30–40% of the exam, involves statistical inference using point estimation, confidence intervals, and significance tests.|$|E

When teachers introduce a new vocabulary word, generally they write it on the chalkboard, have the children spell it, read it and then use it in a sentence. The word is then erased from the chalkboard. Students with good visual memory will recognize that same word later in their readers or other texts and will be able to recall the appearance of the word to spell it.|$|E

25|$|Another {{research}} {{focus for}} EPI is {{the expansion of}} access to educational opportunities that {{are found to be}} of high quality, with the rationale that access is only relevant if it is to a quality learning experience. As the economy has become increasingly global, EPI supports the notion that <b>students</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> armed with skills that set them up for success in a competitive and technologically savvy market. Thus, EPI recognizes the rising need for students to attain postsecondary degrees, and focuses a great deal of its research on the ability of underserved student populations to matriculate through and graduate from higher education institutions, including the financial and social challenges that come along with this goal.|$|E

Approximately thirty students are selected based on their USAMO performance to be trained at the Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program, or MOSP (better known as MOP to its participants). Approximately 12 of the top USAJMO scorers are invited as well.

2500|$|Johnson {{began his}} work on social {{interdependence}} theory and the appropriate use of cooperative, competitive, and individualistic efforts in the mid-1960s.

In the 60's and 70's, while cooperative learning was generally ignored by educators, Johnson challenged the prevailing competitive and individualistic practices by presenting the theory and research on cooperative, competitive, and individualistic learning, creating operational procedures for cooperative learning and appropriate competition, and implementing cooperative learning in schools and universities.|$|E
