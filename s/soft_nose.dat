6000|$|On he journeyed, over hills, {{and through}} rivers till he reached a wide plain, and never a glimpse did he catch of the falcon. Darker and darker it grew, {{and the small}} birds were seeking their nests, and at length Ian Direach could see no more, and he lay down under some bushes and sleep came to him. And in his dream a <b>soft</b> <b>nose</b> touched him, and a warm body curled up beside him, and a low voice whispered to him: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Niver fear; it's me own slugs smell {{their way}} with <b>soft</b> <b>noses,</b> an' they'll spread like flapjacks against the coming out beyand. An' when'll I have the {{pleasure}} of waitin' on ye? The waterhole's a strikin' locality.' ''Tain't bad. Jest be there in an hour, and you won't set long on my coming.' Both men mittened and left the Post, their ears closed to the remonstrances of their comrades. It was such a little thing; yet with such men, little things, nourished by quick tempers and stubborn natures, soon blossomed into big things.|$|R
60|$|So Mowgli {{stretched}} {{himself in}} some long clean grass {{at the edge}} of the field, but before he had closed his eyes a <b>soft</b> gray <b>nose</b> poked him under the chin.|$|R
6000|$|He {{slipped off}} the horse. [...] "Let me {{introduce}} you to Caesar," [...] he said; and she patted Caesar's neck, and remarked how <b>soft</b> his <b>nose</b> was, and secretly deplored the ugliness of equine teeth. Ramage tethered the horse to the farther gate-post, and Caesar blew heavily and began to investigate the hedge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rosa {{had spoken}} rapidly, feeling that her plea {{must be made}} now or never, for before another Christmas she might be far away and speech of no use to win her wish. I was much touched, though {{she was only a}} horse; for she was looking earnestly at me as she spoke, and made the last words very eloquent by {{preparing}} to bend her stiff knees and lie down at my feet. I stopped her, and answered, with an arm about her neck and her <b>soft</b> <b>nose</b> in my hand,-- ...|$|E
60|$|The sun set, {{twilight}} fell, then night {{closed down}} fortunately a night slightly overcast. Gale saw the white horses pass his door like silent ghosts. Even Blanco Diablo made no sound, and that fact {{was indeed a}} tribute to the Yaqui. Gale went out to put his saddle on Blanco Sol. The horse rubbed a <b>soft</b> <b>nose</b> against his shoulder. Then Gale returned to the sitting-room. There was nothing more to do but wait and say good-by. Mercedes came clad in leather chaps and coat, a slim stripling of a cowboy, her dark eyes flashing. Her beauty could not be hidden, and now hope and courage had fired her blood.|$|E
60|$|Again this {{wonderful}} horse amazed me. He pointed his alert and quivering ears {{at me and}} followed with never {{so much as a}} single start or shying bound. He seemed to reason that as I had led him through many dangers safely I could still be trusted. Around us huge trucks rattled, electric cars clanged, railway engines whizzed and screamed, but Ladrone never so much as tightened the rein; and when in the dark of the chute (which led {{to the door of the}} car) he put his <b>soft</b> <b>nose</b> against me to make sure I was still with him, my heart grew so tender that I would not have left him behind for a thousand dollars.|$|E
50|$|Nose grease has mild {{antifoaming}} {{properties and}} can be used to break down a high head on freshly poured beer or <b>soft</b> drinks. Wiping <b>nose</b> grease onto one's finger and then touching or stirring the foam causes it to dissipate rapidly.|$|R
40|$|Less lethal kinetic {{ammunitions}} with <b>soft</b> <b>noses</b> such as eXact iMpact 1006, National Sports Spartan and B&T {{have been}} commonly used by military {{and law enforcement}} officers in the situations where lethal force is not warranted. In order to explore new materials {{to be used as}} nose in such ammunitions, a scholastic study using finite element simulations has been carried out {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} two rubber like elastomers and a polyolefinic foam (low density, highly compressible, stiff and closed cell type of thermos plastic elastomer). State-of-the art thorax surrogate MTHOTA has been employed for the evaluation of blunt thoracic trauma. Force-rigid wall method was employed for the evaluation of head damage curves for each material. XM 1006 has been used as the benchmark projectile for the purpose of comparison. Both blunt thoracic trauma and head damage criterion point of view, both rubbers (R 1 and R 2) have yielded high values of VCmax and peak impact force. Polyolefinic foam (F 1) considered in the study has yielded very promising VCmax values and very less peak impact force when compared with those of bench mark projectile XM 1006...|$|R
5000|$|Jacketed Soft Point (JSP): In {{the late}} 19th century, the Indian Army at Dum-Dum Arsenal, near Calcutta, {{developed}} {{a variation of}} the FMJ design where the jacket did not cover the nose of the bullet. The <b>soft</b> lead <b>nose</b> was found to expand in flesh while the remaining jacket still prevented lead fouling in the barrel. The JSP roughly splits the difference between FMJ and JHP. It gives more penetration than JHP but has better terminal ballistic characteristics than the FMJ.|$|R
60|$|She came to {{know every}} flower that grew, and to call them by name, and she always stepped very {{carefully}} to avoid treading on them, for Dorothy was a kind-hearted child and {{did not like to}} crush the pretty flowers that bloomed in her path. And she was also very fond of all the animals, and learned to know them well, and even to understand their language, which very few people can do. And the animals loved Dorothy in turn, for the word passed around amongst them that she could be trusted to do them no harm. For the horse, whose <b>soft</b> <b>nose</b> Dorothy often gently stroked, told the cow of her kindness, and the cow told the dog, and the dog told the cat, and the cat told her black kitten, and the black kitten told the rabbit when one day they met in the turnip patch.|$|E
5000|$|The [...]500 A-Square {{cartridge}} was {{commercially available}} from both A-Square and Midway USA as loaded ammunition.

5000|$|Goldenhar {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} oculo-auriculo-vertebral (OAV) syndrome) {{is a rare}} congenital defect characterized by incomplete development of the ear, <b>nose,</b> <b>soft</b> palate, lip, and mandible. It is associated with anomalous development of the first branchial arch and second branchial arch. [...] Common clinical manifestations include limbal dermoids, preauricular skin tags, and strabismus.|$|R
50|$|The {{full-face}} mask {{must provide}} a means for the diver to block the nostrils for equalizing the middle ears. This may be provided in several ways. Some masks have a <b>soft</b> rubber <b>nose</b> pocket which allows the diver to pinch the nose directly, some have a soft cushion which can be pressed against {{the lower part of}} the nose to occlude the nostrils, and others have a mechanism which applies soft levers to the sides of the nose to pinch it in the same way that it would be done with fingers. The details of these mechanisms varies, but they all work. Some need to be adjusted to suit the individual diver, others are sufficiently flexible to fit almost anyone.|$|R

50|$|Also in England, KYNOCH the {{well-known}} cartridge manufacturer, produced ammunition, {{referring to the}} 9.3×62mm as the '9.3 mm Mauser'. Typically it was loaded as 'a Metal Covered <b>Soft</b> <b>Nose</b> Bullet. 18.5 g with the base marked simply KYNOCH 9.3 mm. This is no longer listed by them.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike some of {{the more}} modern {{cartridges}} such as the [...]460 Weatherby, the [...]500 Nitro Express is not considered too powerful for use against the big cats. The big cats do not require the more stoutly constructed bullet as they are neither heavy-bodied nor have thick skin, and are best served with a more lightly constructed bullet that is capable of expanding quickly such as the 570 gr g A-Square Lion Load or the Woodleigh 450 gr g <b>Soft</b> <b>Nose.</b>|$|E
60|$|But also {{beside the}} inimical aspects which could set such doubts afoot {{there were in}} her {{infinite}} variety yet other Amandas neither very dear nor very annoying, {{but for the most}} part delightful, who entertained him as strangers might, Amandas with an odd twist which made them amusing to watch, jolly Amandas who were simply irrelevant. There was for example Amanda the Dog Mistress, with an astonishing tact and understanding of dogs, who could explain dogs and the cock of their ears and the droop of their tails and their vanity and their fidelity, and why they looked up and why they suddenly went off round the corner, and their pride in the sound of their voices and their dastardly thoughts and sniffing satisfactions, so that for the first time dogs had souls for Benham to see. And there was an Amanda with a striking passion for the sleekness and <b>soft</b> <b>noses</b> of horses. And there was an Amanda extremely garrulous, who was a biographical dictionary and critical handbook to all the girls in the school she had attended at Chichester--they seemed a very girlish lot of girls; and an Amanda who was very knowing--knowing was the only word for it--about pictures and architecture. And these and all the other Amandas agreed together to develop and share this one quality in common, that altogether they pointed to no end, they converged on nothing. She was, it grew more and more apparent, a miscellany bound in a body. She was an animated discursiveness. That passion to get all things together into one aristocratic aim, that restraint of purpose, that imperative to focus, which was the structural essential of Benham's spirit, was altogether foreign to her composition.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} form {{of artillery}} contact fuze is a <b>soft</b> metal <b>nose</b> to the shell, {{filled with a}} fulminating explosive such as lead azide. An example is the British World War II Fuze, Percussion, D.A., No. 233 ('direct action') The primary explosive transmits its detonation to an explosive booster within the fuze, then in turn to the main charge of the shell. As an artillery shell lands with a considerable impact, the [...] "soft" [...] nose may be made robust enough to be adequately safe for careful handling, without requiring any protection cap or safety mechanism. As a matter of normal practice though, fuzes and shells are transported separately and the fuze is only installed shortly prior to use. These simple contact fuzes are generally used for anti-tank shells, rather than high-explosive.|$|R
2500|$|Compared to {{the more}} popular [...]458 Winchester Magnum and the [...]458 Lott, the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum {{provides}} a flatter trajectory, dropping less than [...] at [...] when sighted in at [...] with the 450 gr. Barnes TSX Weatherby ammunition. With the [...] FMJ or RN Weatherby ammunition bullet drop is [...] at the same range. The [...]458 Winchester Magnum and the [...]458 Lott [...] have a [...] and [...] MPBR respectively in comparison. The [...] FMJ or RN Weatherby ammunition shoot to the same point of impact, which is necessary in a dangerous game cartridge as hunters may need to switch from solids to <b>soft</b> round <b>nose</b> rounds depending on the circumstances and game being hunted. This is due to Weatherby's (Norma) factory loaded ammunition using Hornady's DGS and DGX bullets which have identical G1 ballistic coefficients of [...]295.|$|R
5000|$|Cape {{buffalo and}} rhinoceros, though heavily boned and tough are mostly hunted with soft point bullets {{although}} FMJ and solid bullets are chosen by some hunters. Again as with elephants, premium bullets of a sturdy construction should be chosen. The bullet chosen {{must be able}} to break through bone and penetrate to the vitals. Soft points similar to the A-Square Dead Tough, Barnes TSX, Hornady DGX and the Woodleigh Weldcore <b>Soft</b> <b>Nose</b> are examples of these bullets. The [...]458 Lott has ample power to spare on these species.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{consideration}} {{in choosing a}} bullet for hunting is the velocity window of the bullet. For example, the [...] Woodleigh soft point is designed to expand at [...]470 Nitro Express velocities (2150 fps), and if pushed to the 2400 ft/s potential of the [...]470 Capstick, the Woodleigh will tend to expand very quickly and sacrifice penetration. The Woodleigh <b>soft</b> <b>nose</b> was designed to expand at the lower velocities of the [...]470 Nitro Express, {{and the fact that}} it held together at all in the [...]470 Capstick is testimony to the Woodleigh’s toughness. Penetration was just over 3 ft.|$|E
50|$|The 7×33mm Sako {{cartridge}} {{was created}} in Finland in 1942 as a small game cartridge for animals such as the Capercaillie and Black Grouse. It {{is based on a}} 9×19mm Parabellum case that has been lengthened and necked down to accept a 7.21mm bullet. The cartridge overall length is 44.30mm with a case length of 33.30mm and a base diameter of 10mm. The bottleneckbends at 26.50 mm (dia 9.50 mm) and straightens at 29.12 mm (dia 7.80mm). The Bertram company of Australia makes brass for it. Sako offers two loadings, a 78gr (5.1g) FMJ and a 78gr <b>soft</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chief {{markers of}} Goldenhar {{syndrome}} are incomplete {{development of the}} ear, <b>nose,</b> <b>soft</b> palate, lip, and mandible on usually {{one side of the}} body. Additionally, some patients will have growing issues with internal organs, especially heart, kidneys, and lungs. Typically, the organ will either not be present on one side or will be underdeveloped. Note that while it is more usual for there to be problems on only one side, it has been known for defects to occur bilaterally (approximate incidence 10% of confirmed GS cases).|$|R
5000|$|Compared to {{the more}} popular [...]458 Winchester Magnum and the [...]458 Lott, the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum {{provides}} a flatter trajectory, dropping less than 10 in at 300 yd when sighted in at 200 yd with the 450 gr. Barnes TSX Weatherby ammunition. With the [...] FMJ or RN Weatherby ammunition bullet drop is 11 in at the same range. The [...]458 Winchester Magnum and the [...]458 Lott have a 206 yd and 220 yd MPBR respectively in comparison. The [...] FMJ or RN Weatherby ammunition shoot to the same point of impact, which is necessary in a dangerous game cartridge as hunters may need to switch from solids to <b>soft</b> round <b>nose</b> rounds depending on the circumstances and game being hunted.

50|$|In the pterygopalatine ganglion, the preganglionic {{parasympathetic}} fibers {{from the}} greater petrosal {{branch of the}} facial nerve synapse with neurons whose postganglionic axons, vasodilator, and secretory fibers are distributed with the deep branches of the trigeminal nerve to the mucous membrane of the <b>nose,</b> <b>soft</b> palate, tonsils, uvula, roof of the mouth, upper lip and gums, and upper part of the pharynx. It also sends postganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal nerve (a branch of the Ophthalmic nerve, also part of the trigeminal nerve) via the zygomatic nerve, a branch of the maxillary nerve (from the trigeminal nerve), which then arrives at the lacrimal gland.|$|R
5000|$|Ammunition {{and arms}} catalogs {{of the era}} {{describe}} a standard loading of a 270 gr [...] "metal-covered" [...] (i.e., jacketed) <b>soft</b> <b>nose</b> bullet. No other bullet weights or patterns are shown, although {{it is possible that}} full-metal-jacketed or other patterns or weights of bullets may have been produced at some time. Curiously, Kynoch lists loads for the 9.5mm Mannlicher-Schoenauer with a 45 grain charge of smokeless propellant (for a muzzle velocity of 2200 fps) and the [...] ".375 Rimless Nitro Express" [...] with a reduced 43 grain charge (for a muzzle velocity of 2100 fps). This may have reflected the differences in the regulation of the sights by the respective manufacturers and distributors, between Westley Richards for the higher powered Mannlicher-Schoenauer loading and the trade rifles with the generic [...]375 Rimless Nitro Express loading.|$|E
5000|$|While {{some writers}} in the 1960s {{considered}} the [...]351 SL inadequate as a deer round, its killing power {{is very similar to}} the original loadings of the 30-30 and has similar energy at the muzzle as 35 Remington does at approximately 75 yards—pushing a 180 grain largish diameter (35 caliber) jacketed <b>soft</b> <b>nose</b> bullet at nearly 1900 fps. It has had some popularity in the jungle, where its lack of long-range power or accuracy are less important. When first introduced, many found the [...]351 SL to be a good deer cartridge at ranges under 200 yards, at least in comparison to the many low-pressure cartridges of the black powder era. Some of the things leading to the commercial death of the cartridge were its unusual bullet diameter (.351 vs all the other 20th century 35 caliber rifle and handgun cartridges which are [...]357 or [...]358) and the unusual rebated rim design of the case.|$|E
50|$|Winky is a house-elf who {{originally}} served the Crouch family, {{described as having}} enormous brown eyes and a large, round, <b>soft</b> <b>nose.</b> She viewed herself as a dutiful servant and guarded the family's many secrets. When Barty Crouch Jr is rescued from Azkaban by his mother, he is supervised and nursed back to health by Winky. In Goblet of Fire, she persuades Barty Crouch Sr to let his son attend the Quidditch World Cup; she attends it with the younger Crouch, who is hiding under an Invisibility Cloak, and claims the apparently empty seat beside her is being saved for Crouch Sr. During the festivities, Crouch Jr steals Harry's wand {{from his pocket and}} later uses it to conjure the Dark Mark, in spite of Winky's attempts to stop him. In the resulting chaos, Harry and his friends see Winky running into the forest, appearing to struggle against the invisible Crouch Jr. Later she is caught with Harry's wand, which is magically proven to be the one used to conjure the Dark Mark; though Crouch Sr realises what happened, he agrees with the apparent conclusion that Winky conjured the mark, and fires her, both to save face and as punishment for failing to control Crouch Jr. Following her dismissal, Dobby takes the distraught Winky to work with him at Hogwarts. There the unhappy Winky, retaining her loyalty to Crouch, becomes an alcoholic until the final book, and eventually fights in the Battle of Hogwarts with the other house-elves.|$|E
50|$|The dummy head {{manufacturers}} {{design their}} products differently {{to one another}} catering for specific situations. The Neumann dummy’s are designed as the head with pinnae and a nose, whereas the Brüel & Kjær design includes <b>soft</b> moulded pinnae, <b>nose,</b> mouth and torso. Both the dummy head and the HATS {{can be used to}} record audio of the same nature but are specifically designed to accomplish different tasks. A new manufacturer to the market for recording binaural is 3Dio with the purpose of recording on a smaller scale. The 3Dio microphones are situated in the ears at an average head distance apart, however the model does not include the full head or torso.|$|R
5000|$|The {{incubation}} period of CHV is six to ten days. [...] CHV is transmitted to puppies {{in the birth}} canal and by contact with infected oral and nasal secretions from the mother or other infected dogs, {{but it is not}} spread through the air. [...] The virus replicates in the surface cells of the nasal mucosa, tonsils, and pharynx. Low body temperature allows the virus to spread and infect the rest of the body. [...] Symptoms include crying, weakness, depression, discharge from the <b>nose,</b> <b>soft,</b> yellow feces, and a loss of the sucking reflex. CHV also causes a necrotizing vasculitis that results in hemorrhage around the blood vessels. [...] Bruising of the belly may occur. Eye lesions include keratitis, uveitis, optic neuritis, retinitis, and retinal dysplasia. [...] There is a high mortality rate, approaching 80 percent in puppies less than one week old, and death usually occurs in one to two days.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]500 Nitro Express was {{designed}} as a hunting cartridge for use against large and heavy dangerous game such as Cape buffalo, rhinoceros and African elephant. The 570 gr g bullet has excellent sectional density which is required for work against dangerous game out to 110 yd and provides adequate penetration for the hunting of thick-skinned, dangerous game. Some professional African hunters have complained that the taper of the 570 grain bullet toward the nose, increases the incidents of bullet [...] "fish tailing" [...] during penetration causing the bullet to not maintain a straight course. The 570 gr gsolid bullet is used mainly for elephant but is also used in some situations for Cape buffalo and rhinoceros when the extra penetration provided by these non-expanding bullets is desired. Mated with the 570 gr g solid bullet, the [...]500 Nitro Express has become the quintessential elephant cartridge on the African savanna. The round <b>nose</b> <b>soft</b> point 570 gr g bullet is used on most other game species.|$|R
