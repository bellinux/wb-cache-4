5|$|The Welsh Mountain sheep is a {{hardy breed}} that can scrape {{a living from}} the mountainous {{habitats}} where they <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> year. Being adept at exploiting their environment, they have local knowledge of their mountains and are {{left to their own}} devices, being gathered once or twice a year. Originally often horned, and various shades of brown or black, they were often of poor conformation and bedraggled appearance. More recently, scientific breeding has improved them and they have been exported to many parts of the world. They form part of the ancestry of various local breeds of sheep in Wales, the Llanwenog, the Lleyn sheep, the Kerry Hill, the badger-faced, the Welsh mule and the Beulah speckle-faced. In rural areas, sheep are still an important part of life with local livestock shows and sheep dog trials taking place annually.|$|E

25|$|In Yoga principle, it is {{recommended}} that one maintains a spiritual fast on a particular day each week (Monday or Thursday). A fast should also be maintained on the full moon day of each month. It is essential on the spiritual fasting day to not only to abstain from meals, but also to <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> day with a positive, spiritual attitude. On the fasting day, intake of solid food during the day is avoided and only a light veggie meal around 5 o'clock is taken. Water can be taken any time as needed. If health does not permit fasting for a whole day, for example with Diabetes, careful planning is done to reduce or skip one meal.|$|E
25|$|The {{years of}} {{dictatorship}} were gruesome. Apart {{from the students}} that got 7 {{years in prison for}} toasting to freedom which led directly to the foundation of Amnesty International in 1961, in 1968 students would <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> night greasing streets and sidewalks with soap so the mounted police {{would have a hard time}} chasing them down to break a demonstration. It is said that a student dared a policeman to get his shoes and feet wet chasing after a cigarette lighter, thrown in the duck pond, while he had the license for it in his pocket. In those days one needed a permit to own a cigarette lighter, as imposed by Salazar to protect the matches industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{development and}} growth of the Kabala produced other forms of asceticism. In fact, the Ḥasid and the Ẓanua' of the medieval apocalyptic literature being a survival of Essenism, ablutions and fasting were resorted to by the adepts of the Cabala as means of attaining communion with the upper world. Some of these Ḥasidim would <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> week—without or with interruption, according to their physical endurance—in fasting, rendering only the Sabbath a day of comfort and joy. The object of their penitences and fastings was {{to bring about the}} time of divine favor, the Messianic era. Every Messianic movement had therefore Ascetics as leaders, such as were the Shabbethaians (see H. Grätz, Gesch. der Juden, iii. 307) and others (see Abraham ben Samuel Cohen of Lask). Others would refrain from eating animal food—'eber min ha-Ḥay—and, like the Buddhists or the Pythagoreans of old, live on vegetarian diet. The same is related by Epiphanius of the Dosithean sect.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} critics {{took issue with}} what they {{interpreted}} as the film's underlying messages. San Francisco Chronicle critic Mick Lasalle wrote in his parental advisory that [...] "basically, this is a movie about kids who go into another world and dimension and <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> time killing people." [...] MSNBC reviewer Alonso Duralde noted that [...] "all the heroes have British accents while the Telmarines are all decidedly Mediterranean in appearance and inflection". An Anglican Journal review described the movie as reasonably faithful to the adventure elements of the book, much lighter on the religious faith aspects, which they found integral to the novel, and deficient on character and emotion.|$|E

500|$|... "Littlest Things" [...] has met mixed reviews; Heather Phares from AllMusic complimented the song, {{saying the}} ballad softens Allen's rough image and celebrates [...] "the mundane moments {{of a dying}} relationship", whereas Blender {{reporter}} Jon Dolan considers it a [...] "forlorn single", where the singer writes about the terror {{of being in a}} relationship [...] "with white-knuckled worry over a snip of florid piano from a ’70s soft-core porn flick". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticised Allen for being a [...] "poser who lacks charisma, bites off of everyone else, and is so sickeningly contemptuous of everyone but herself that it makes the pretty, melancholy piano-and-drum-loop ballad 'Littlest Things' seem like a farce". While analysing Alright, Still, The Guardian reviewer, Sophie Heawood, described the lyrics as the [...] "perfect description of missing someone: 'We'd <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> weekend lying in our own dirt/ I was just so happy in your boxers and your T-shirt'." [...] Mark Pytlik from Pitchfork Media gave a positive review, saying that [...] "'Littlest Things' is a supple piano-tickler that provides one of Allen's sweetest lyrical moments while simultaneously leaving Ms. Dynamite in the dust on the R balladeering front". He believed that the song is made out of Allen's [...] "comfort zone" [...] of songs such as [...] "Smile", the result being of [...] "high order, if not a bit more erratic". IGN reviewer Todd Gilchrist named the song as the album's [...] "most affecting tune", while thought it [...] "compiles a sad and beautiful checklist of the intimate moments she no longer shares with her dearly departed boyfriend".|$|E

2500|$|The {{campaign}} season typically lasted through May to October; {{due to lack}} of fodder campaigns in winter were rare, but the French practice of storing food and provisions in magazines brought them considerable advantage, often enabling them to take to the field weeks before their foes. Nevertheless, military operations during the Nine Years' War did not produce decisive results. The war was dominated by what may be called 'positional warfare' – the construction, defence, and attack of fortresses and entrenched lines. Positional warfare played a wide variety of roles: fortresses controlled bridgeheads and passes, guarded supply routes, and served as storehouses and magazines. However, fortresses hampered the ability to follow success on the battlefield – defeated armies could flee to friendly fortifications, enabling them to recover and rebuild their numbers from less threatened fronts. Many lesser commanders welcomed these relatively predictable, static operations to mask their lack of military ability. As Daniel Defoe observed in 1697, [...] "Now it is frequent to have armies of 50,000 men of a side [...] <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> campaign in dodging – or, as it is genteelly called – observing one another, and then march off into winter quarters." [...] In fact, during the Nine Years' War field armies had waxed to nearly 100,000 men in 1695, the strain of which had reduced the Maritime Powers to a fiscal crisis while the French struggled under the weight of a shattered economy.|$|E
2500|$|The series {{focuses on}} the {{exploits}} and misadventures of short-fused hotelier Basil Fawlty and his acerbic wife Sybil, {{as well as their}} employees: porter and waiter Manuel, maid Polly, and, in the second series, chef Terry. The episodes typically revolve around Basil's efforts to succeed in [...] "raising the tone" [...] of his hotel and his increasing frustration at the numerous complications and mistakes, both his own and those of others, which prevent him from doing so. Much of the humour comes from Basil's overly aggressive manner, engaging in angry but witty arguments with guests, staff and, in particular, Sybil, whom he addresses (in a faux-romantic way) with insults such as [...] "that golfing puff adder", [...] "my little piranha fish" [...] and [...] "my little nest of vipers". Despite this, he frequently feels intimidated, she being able to stop him in his tracks at any time, usually with a short, sharp cry of [...] "Basil!" [...] At the end of some episodes, Basil succeeds in annoying (or at least bemusing) the guests and frequently gets his comeuppance. Basil occasionally longs for a touch of class, sometimes by playing recordings of classical music. In one episode he is playing music by Brahms when Sybil remarks, after pestering him asking to do different tasks: [...] "You could have them both done by now if you hadn't <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> morning skulking in there listening to that racket." [...] Basil replies, with exasperation, [...] "Racket?? That's Brahms! Brahms' Third Racket!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On the pitch, Torquay {{struggled}} {{to get back to}} the early season form which saw them <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of August at the top of the League Two table. [...] Although a creditable 1-1 draw away to in-form Shrewsbury Town seemed to point to an improvement in the team's performances, the Gulls were then to crash out three days later to Swindon Town in the Second Round of the Johnstone Paints Trophy (although, the fact that several of Torquay's first choice regulars were rested for the match indicated that the League Trophy was not high on Paul Buckle's list of priorities). [...] Astonishingly, Torquay then managed to scrape only a 3-3 draw away to Crewe and then lose 4-3 at home to Bury, despite going 2-0 ahead in both matches. [...] However, a corner of sorts appeared to have been turned in their match away to Gillingham when, at 1-0 down with 94 minutes of the match played and with newly installed club captain Lee Mansell sent off four minutes previously, a Kevin Nicholson free kick somehow managed to sneak past Gills keeper Alan Julian and salvage a 1-1 draw with the final kick of the game. [...] The Gulls took their good fortune with them into their final game of the month at home to Morecambe, where they ran out 3-1 winners and achieved only their first victory in ten league games. [...] With an upturn in their on-field performances, Torquay were now able to look forward to November with renewed optimism.|$|E

2500|$|In later years, Lake became {{increasingly}} involved in archeological expeditions. [...] He had remarkable abilities as an organizer and an uncanny skill {{in finding the}} necessary money to fund his various undertakings. [...] In the spring of 1927, with Robert P. Blake, he traveled to Saint Catherine's Monastery in Egypt in order to study biblical manuscripts. [...] While passing through Cairo they met the Egyptologist Alan H. Gardiner who suggested that on their return they might stop by Serabit el-Khadim, {{which was in the}} neighborhood of the monastery, and attempt to locate a number of previously noticed inscriptions in a Proto-Sinaitic script. [...] As Lake remarked in his account of the adventure: [...] "It should be noted that 'in the neighborhood' is a relative matter, for, stated in terms of time instead of space, the monastery was about as far from Serabit as New York is from San Francisco." [...] After a week's journey on camels they were able to locate the site and the inscriptions, as well as identify two additional inscriptions not previously known. [...] "It is a pity that we could not identify the fragments more accurately," [...] Lake noted, [...] "but the temperature in the shade was over 115° Fahr., and the fragments were in the sun and almost too hot to touch" [...] (HTR 21 : 3-4, 5). [...] Lake would return to further investigate the site, as well as the adjacent temple of Hathor in 1930 on an expedition led by him and Blake, this time accompanied by Silva (his future second wife), at the time a Guggenheim fellow, who would handle the photography. [...] In the results of the expedition that were published in 1932, Lake described the camp: [...] "It was not exactly luxurious, and on two days when in rained it was extremely uncomfortable, as we had to <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> time in the cave, in which it was impossible to stand upright except in a few spots. [...] The cooking was shared by Professor Blake and Mrs. [...] New, and consisted chiefly of rice, with canned meat dissolved in tomato-sauce and curry-powder" [...] (HTR 25 : 98-99). [...] A final trip was made in 1935; unfortunately, this time Lake was injured during the trip. [...] He received internal injuries when bumped by a camel, but continued the journey, and was carried by litter {{to the top of the}} mountain. [...] After supervising the start of the excavation, his condition worsened and he was rushed to Jerusalem with his wife to receive medical attention. [...] In 1929, Lake approached John Winter Crowfoot of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem (BSAJ) about a joint excavation with some other institutions of Samaria, to complete the earlier work of Harvard's George A. Reisner. [...] The new dig began in 1931 and Lake was there for four seasons (1931–34), accompanied again by Silva and Blake. [...] The joint team also included Eleazar Sukenik from Hebrew University and Kathleen Kenyon from the BSAJ. [...] The excavation would yield many important results. [...] As for accommodations in the camp, Kenyon reports that [...] "although they had a hotel-trained Egyptian cook and Palestinian servants to do the washing, the expedition staff lived in tents, sleeping on camp beds" [...] and [...] "the social life of the dig consisted of having cocktails at the end of the day, playing bridge after dinner, and in 1933, listening to jazz records." [...] In 1938–39, Lake along with Silva and Robert P. Casey from Brown University were allowed to conduct a small excavation of Van Fortress in Turkish Armenia. [...] For 15 years he had been seeking permission from the Turkish government to make the expedition. [...] He told the press that until 1937, [...] "the savage tribes of Turkish Armenia, the Kurds, have not been sufficiently pacified for the government to recommend the trip." [...] Details of the expedition were published in 1939.|$|E
