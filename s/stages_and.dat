5|$|Dr. Wily's Revenge reuses and mixes stage components, enemies, and robot masters {{from the}} first two NES games in the Mega Man series. The initial four <b>stages</b> <b>and</b> bosses (Cut Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, and Elec Man) come from the {{original}} Mega Man. A password system allows the player {{to return to the}} game after any or all of these first four stages are cleared or when the player suffers a game over. Once the player completes these <b>stages</b> <b>and</b> travels through Wily's fortress, four more robot masters must be fought in order to progress. These bosses (Quick Man, Bubble Man, Flash Man, and Heat Man) are taken from Mega Man 2 for NES. Although they do not have their own stages, the player earns the special weapons of these bosses. Once all four are defeated, the player faces a new robot master created for the game, Enker.|$|E

40|$|Background: Various {{systems of}} Computerized Tomographic (CT) <b>staging</b> <b>and</b> scoring {{have been applied}} to define the extent of sinus {{abnormality}} {{and the degree of}} mucosal thickening. Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) has been used with considerable success rate to treat chronic sinonasal patients unresponsive to medical therapy. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between the result of CT scoring <b>and</b> <b>staging</b> <b>and</b> the outcome of surgery. Methods: The one year outcome of FESS together with preoperative CT <b>staging</b> <b>and</b> scoring were determined and compared with each other. Results: Compared to those with higher <b>stages</b> (III <b>and</b> IV), patients with lower preoperative CT <b>stages</b> (I <b>and</b> II) had a significantly higher successful outcome of surgery. CT <b>staging</b> <b>and</b> scoring were obviously correlated. Conclusions: The results of this study show that preoperative CT <b>staging</b> <b>and</b> scoring are two useful means for better prediction of the long–term outcome of surgery one year after FESS.

5|$|Race {{director}} Angelo Zomegnan {{commented that}} the route {{was designed to be}} easier than that of the extremely climbing-intensive 2006 Giro. The Giro's twenty-one stages were divided into the following classifications: three time trials (one team and two individual), eleven flat or undulating stages (officially there was no distinction made between flat and undulating), four intermediate <b>stages,</b> <b>and</b> three mountain stages. The race began with a team time trial on the island of Sardinia. This was followed by two flat <b>stages</b> <b>and</b> an unusually early rest day to transfer from Sardinia to Italy's mainland. The riders transferred by plane while the Giro caravan, race officials and team cars made the trip by boat. The final stage, as was tradition, was a flat, mostly ceremonial road stage to Milan, finishing with ten circuits on the Corso Venezia of the Via Montenapoleone.|$|E
