50|$|In {{a master}} keyed lock, {{some or all}} of the shaft hole in the lock have three pins in them instead of two. Between the driver pin and the key pin is a third pin called the spacer pin.

So the lock will open with two keys; one aligns the first set of <b>shear</b> <b>points</b> and the other aligns the second set of <b>shear</b> <b>points.</b> The locks are {{manufactured}} so one set of <b>shear</b> <b>points</b> is unique to each lock, while the second set is identical in all the locks.

Analysis of variance was used to assess statistical differences between the degree of fibrosis on percutaneous liver biopsy and elastography measurements. No statistical difference was present when comparing elastography measurements in patients with hepatic steatosis compared with patients without steatosis (P = 0. 2759).

40|$|Abstract We {{develop a}} {{multiple}} interface variational model, comprising multiple Taylor-relaxed plasma regions, {{each of which}} are separated by an ideal MHD barrier. A principle motivation {{is the development of}} a mathematically rigorous ideal MHD model to describe intrinsically 3 D equilibria, with nonzero internal pressure. A second application is the description of transport barriers as constrained minimum energy states. As a first example, we calculate the plasma solution in a periodic cylinder, generalizing the analysis of the treatment of Kaiser and Uecker, Q. Jl. Mech. Appl. Math., 57 (1), 2004, who treated the single interface in cylindrical geometry. Expressions for the equilibrium field are generated, and equilib-rium states computed. Unlike other Taylor relaxed equilibria, for the equilibria investigated here, only the plasma core necessarily has reverse magnetic shear. We show the existence of tokamak like equilibria, with increasing safety factor and stepped-pressure profiles. A stability treatment of the multiple barrier configuration reduces to an eigenvalue problem, where the eigenvectors are the normal displacements of the ideal barriers, and the eigen-matrix has tridiagonal structure. Next, marginal stability thresholds are explored in parameter space. For a single interface, results are benchmarked to Kaiser and Uecker. For multiple interfaces, we check our working via convergence tests, which reveal that the system approaches the single barrier case in the limit of vanishing interface width. The analysis provides a foundation upon which to study the stability of systems with a single internal barrier, placed at the reverse <b>shear</b> <b>point.</b> 1...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{designed}} for generating internal transport barriers in the plasmas of the Joint European Torus [JET, P. H. Rebut et al., Proceedings of the 10 th International Conference, Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion, London (International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, 1985), Vol. I, p. 11] reveal cascades of Alfven perturbations with predominantly upward frequency sweeping. These experiments {{are characterized by}} a hollow plasma current profile, created by lower hybrid heating and current drive before the main heating power phase. The cascades are driven by ions accelerated with Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH). Each cascade consists of many modes with different toroidal mode numbers and different frequencies. The toroidal mode numbers vary from n - 1 to n = 6. The frequency starts from 20 to 90 kHz and increases up to the frequency range of Toroidal Alfven Eigenmodes. In the framework of ideal MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) model, a close correlation is found between the time evolution of the Alfven cascades {{and the evolution of}} the Alfven continuum frequency at the point of zero magnetic shear. This correlation facilitates the study of the time evolution of both the Alfven continuum and the safety factor, q(r), at the point of zero magnetic shear and makes it possible to use Alfven spectroscopy for studying q(r). Modelling shows that the Alfven cascade occurs when the Alfven continuum frequency has a maximum at the zero <b>shear</b> <b>point.</b> Interpretation of the Alfven cascades is given in terms of a novel-type of Energetic Particle Mode localized at the point where q(r) has a minimum. This interpretation explains the key experimental observations: simultaneous generation of many modes, preferred direction of frequency sweeping and the absence of strong continuum damping.

The direct shear tests were carried out on wooden cylindrical rods. These tests and its DEM simulation indicated that the normal and shear loads exerted by the direct shear equipment were transmitted and resisted by the rods through force chains. Only a fraction of the rods developed these resisting force chains, the rest of the rods remained idle and could be removed without affecting the stability of the system. The effect of force chains on the simulated granular material was studied in the laboratory by the point load test. Point load tests on gravel indicated that the size of the gravel and their degree of moisture influenced their strength. Proctor tests were also used to analyze fragmentation under compressive loads. Samples of gravel were subjected to different levels of compression in a cylindrical container measuring 10 cm in diameter. DEM simulation of the test indicated that the compressive force induced by the Proctor hammer was transmitted to the gravel through force chains. These force chains caused {{the fragmentation}} of the gravel. The grain size distribution of the gravel before and after the compaction tests were evaluated and used in conjunction with fractal theory to analyze the levels of fragmentation experienced by the gravel.
