5|$|Around the {{painting}} lie corpses {{in various states}} of undress. The Destroying Angel was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the July Revolution at first hand, and the sight and <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in The Destroying Angel were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.|$|E

5|$|Huge urban roosts {{in cities}} can create {{problems}} {{due to the}} noise and mess made and the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed on the clock hands of London's Big Ben that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of The Goon Show in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts to disrupt the large common starling roosts in central London.|$|E
5|$|After the French chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, Louis Jacques Thénard, and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac {{approved}} the experiments {{of the young}} pharmacist Balard, the results were presented at a lecture of the Académie des Sciences and published in Annales de Chimie et Physique. In his publication, Balard states that he changed the name from muride to brôme on the proposal of M. Anglada. Brôme (bromine) derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench). Other sources claim that the French chemist and physicist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac suggested the name brôme for the characteristic <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vapors. Bromine was not produced in large quantities until 1858, when the discovery of salt deposits in Stassfurt enabled its production as a by-product of potash.|$|E

25|$|By the 1950s, {{the city}} {{began to use}} {{the hole in the}} esker for {{purposes}} other than storing gravel.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} has been advanced {{for the presence}} of the unusual smells. They could possibly have resulted from the burning or smouldering (but not detonation) of the bombs' explosives, or they could have been the natural <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosive. The homemade explosive thought to have been used in the 7 July bombings, TATP, is notoriously unstable and emits a distinctive smell as it sublimates.|$|E
40|$|Primates have {{traditionally}} been considered having a poor sense <b>of</b> <b>smell</b> compared to other orders of mammals, like carnivores, due to reduced olfactory structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primate brain. This thought, however, is slowly changing. There are now a range of studies showing that primates do use their sense <b>of</b> <b>smell,</b> for example in chemical communication. However, {{few studies have been}} carried out on olfactory-related behaviors in Great Apes. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this study was to assess <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> olfactory-related behaviors in captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). The results do not only show that chimpanzees use their sense <b>of</b> <b>smell,</b> but also a behavioral difference between male and female chimpanzees. There was a significant difference between male to female <b>smelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anogenitals and male to male <b>smelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anogenitals (p = 0. 0001) and also a difference between <b>the</b> occurrences <b>of</b> males and females touching an object with the hand and then smelling at the hand (p = 0. 0007). There was a significant difference between male and female frequency <b>of</b> <b>smelling</b> at an object (p = 0. 001) and a significant difference between <b>the</b> occurrences <b>of</b> male and female smelling at foods and liquids (p = 0. 003). There were no observations of chimpanzees performing a scent-marking behavior. These results suggest that chimpanzees use their sense <b>of</b> <b>smell,</b> from investigating new objects to <b>the</b> inspection <b>of</b> food and other chimpanzees. It would be interesting in future studies to study the difference between male and female frequency of olfactory-related behaviors...|$|R

25|$|Proper {{preservation}} of perfumes involves keeping {{them away from}} sources of heat and storing them where {{they will not be}} exposed to light. An opened bottle will keep its aroma intact for several years, {{as long as it is}} well stored.

25|$|An {{essential}} oil extracted from eucalyptus leaves contains compounds that are powerful natural disinfectants {{and can be}} toxic in large quantities. Several marsupial herbivores, notably koalas and some possums, are relatively tolerant of it. The close correlation of these oils with other more potent toxins called formylated phloroglucinol compounds (euglobals, macrocarpals and sideroxylonals) allows koalas and other marsupial species to make food choices based on the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves. For koalas, these compounds {{are the most important}} factor in leaf choice.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{pit latrine}} can be {{improved}} {{in a number of}} ways. One includes adding a ventilation pipe from the pit to above the structure. This improves airflow and decreases the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toilet. It also can reduce flies when the top of the pipe is covered with mesh (usually made out of fiberglass). In these types of toilets a lid need not be used to cover the hole in the floor. Other possible improvements include a floor constructed so fluid drains into the hole and a reinforcement of {{the upper part of the}} pit with bricks, blocks, or cement rings to improve stability.|$|E
50|$|Dental {{patients}} with generalized anxiety, belonephobia (fear of needles and sharp instruments), prior dental trauma, or generalized fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dentist can take oral medication {{in order to}} reduce their anxieties. A variety of single and incremental dose protocols are used to medicate the patient as early as the day before treatment. Medication additionally helps reduce memory or <b>the</b> sights and <b>smells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dental office to avoid recall <b>of</b> any trauma. <b>The</b> sedative effect allows more dentistry to be completed in fewer appointments as well as allowing complex procedures to be performed in less time.|$|R
500|$|In a 2012 interview, Katamsi {{admitted}} {{the film was}} in part overacted {{and that it had}} been a potent way to spread and indoctrinate viewers in the New Order's ideology. The Tempo survey suggested that it was effective propaganda, leading viewers to [...] "reject all that <b>smelled</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PKI and communism". Although it is no longer broadcast on 30 September, the film remains available.

40|$|Smells are invisible, ephemeral and volatile. <b>Smells</b> <b>of</b> a city often remain {{hidden and}} undiscovered.

25|$|The insole is the {{interior}} {{bottom of a}} shoe, which sits directly beneath the foot under the footbed (also known as sock liner). The purpose of insole is to attach to the lasting margin of the upper, which is wrapped around the last during {{the closing of the}} shoe during the lasting operation. Insoles are usually made of cellulosic paper board or synthetic non woven insole board. Many shoes have removable and replaceable footbeds. Extra cushioning is often added for comfort (to control the shape, moisture, or <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shoe) or health reasons (to help deal with differences in the natural shape of the foot or positioning of the foot during standing or walking).|$|E
25|$|Anhydrous ammonia is {{classified}} as toxic (T) and dangerous for the environment (N). The gas is flammable (autoignition temperature: 651nbsp&°C) and can form explosive mixtures with air (16–25%). The permissible exposure limit (PEL) in the United States is 50nbsp&ppm (35nbsp&mg/m3), while the IDLH concentration is estimated at 300nbsp&ppm. Repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gas: normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than 50nbsp&ppm, but desensitised individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of 100nbsp&ppm. Anhydrous ammonia corrodes copper- and zinc-containing alloys, and so brass fittings {{should not be used}} for handling the gas. Liquid ammonia can also attack rubber and certain plastics.|$|E
25|$|The Imperial Family {{were not}} the only {{residents}} of the palace; below the metal framework in the attics lived an army of servants. So vast were the servants' quarters that a former servant and his family, unbeknownst to the palace authorities, moved into the roof of the palace. They were only discovered by the <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manure from the cow that they had also smuggled into the building with them to provide fresh milk. It seems this cow was not the only bovine in the attics; other cows were kept next to the room occupied by the Maids of Honour, in order to provide fresh milk for the kitchens. This practice was discontinued after the 1837 fire.|$|E
50|$|Diorissimo, {{based on}} lily <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley, was a notable {{achievement}} in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> perfumery.

40|$|Detecting {{danger is}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{foremost}} tasks for a neural system. Larval parasitoids constitute clear danger to Drosophila, as up to 80 % of fly larvae become parasitized in nature. We show that Drosophila melanogaster larvae and adults avoid sites <b>smelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main parasitoid enemies, Leptopilina wasps. This avoidance is mediated via a highly specific olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) type. While the larval OSN expresses the olfactory receptor Or 49 a and is {{tuned to the}} Leptopilina odor iridomyrmecin, the adult expresses both Or 49 a and Or 85 f and in addition detects the wasp odors actinidine and nepetalactol. The information is transferred via projection neurons to a specific part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lateral horn known {{to be involved in}} mediating avoidance. Drosophila has thus developed a dedicated circuit to detect a life-threatening enemy based on <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> its semiochemicals. Such an enemy-detecting olfactory circuit has earlier only been characterized in mice and nematodes...|$|R
30|$|Further {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> {{books in}} <b>the</b> collective olfactory memory is <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> scented products themed on books and libraries (over 30 candles, perfumes and oils) available {{from a single}} London store in 2015.
