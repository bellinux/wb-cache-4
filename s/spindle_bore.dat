5000|$|To {{hold the}} bar or {{workpiece}} {{at the back}} end of the <b>spindle</b> <b>bore</b> and support it concentrically, so that it resists wobbling or whipping while the spindle is turning. Gun barrels and oil pipes are examples of workpieces that benefit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{smallest}} lathes are [...] "jewelers lathes" [...] or [...] "watchmaker lathes", {{which are}} small {{enough that they}} may be held in one hand. The workpieces machined on a jeweler's lathe are metal. Jeweler's lathes can be used with hand-held [...] "graver" [...] tools or with compound rests that attach to the lathe bed. Graver tools are generally supported by a T-rest, not fixed to a cross slide or compound rest. The work is usually held in a collet. Common <b>spindle</b> <b>bore</b> sizes are 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm. The term W/W refers to the Webster/Whitcomb collet and lathe, invented by the American Watch Tool Company of Waltham, Massachusetts. Most lathes commonly referred to as watchmakers lathes are of this design. In 1909, the American Watch Tool company introduced the Magnus type collet (a 10-mm body size collet) using a lathe of the same basic design, the Webster/Whitcomb Magnus. (F.W.Derbyshire, Inc. retains the trade names Webster/Whitcomb and Magnus and still produces these collets.) Two bed patterns are common: the WW (Webster Whitcomb) bed, a truncated triangular prism (found only on 8 and 10 mm watchmakers' lathes); and the continental D-style bar bed (used on both 6 mm and 8 mm lathes by firms such as Lorch and Star). Other bed designs have been used, such a triangular prism on some Boley 6.5 mm lathes, and a V-edged bed on IME's 8 mm lathes.|$|E
40|$|Resistance in {{sugarcane}} [Saccharum spec. (Poaceae) ] to {{the spotted}} stalk borer, Chilo sacchariphagus (Bojer) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), was studied by comparing feeding behaviour on resistant cv. R 570 and susceptible cv. R 579. In a field survey, the feeding behaviour of C. sacchariphagus larvae was described {{to identify their}} feeding sites on the plant. In a greenhouse artificial infestation study, we compared the establishment of larvae on potted plants. In laboratory choice and no-choice experiments, we studied the establishment of larvae on plant organs (stalk, sheath, leaf spindle). Study of the feeding behaviour showed that: (1) first to fourth instars are able to feed on stalk, sheath, and leaf <b>spindle,</b> (2) <b>boring</b> into the stalk occurs mostly in the four uppermost internodes, and (3) most young larvae bore through the abaxial surface of leaf sheaths to reach the stalk. In greenhouse experiments, we observed an early two-fold reduction {{of the number of}} larvae on R 570 plants within the first 48 h after infestation. In laboratory experiments, larval antixenosis was demonstrated at the abaxial surface of R 570 leaf sheath, but was observed neither in the leaf spindle nor in the stalk. First, second, and third instars were susceptible to this antixenosis. We hypothesize that the main resistance mechanism in R 570 is an early reduction of larval establishment on plants, due to antixenosis located at the abaxial surface of leaf sheaths.

40|$|Abstract. Thermal induced {{errors are}} {{significant}} {{factors that affect}} machine tool accuracy. The deformation of spindle is the main contributor to thermal error. In this paper, the thermal characteristics of the spindle system are investigated. Taking into account the coupling of elastic deformation and temperature, the heat conduction of the spindle system is modeled. The heat of bearings and heat transfer coefficient, and boundary conditions of the spindle are determined. Based on the numerical results, an iterative model of spindle's temperature and thermal deformation are acquired under the actions of thermal loads using the finite element method. Taking the <b>spindle</b> of precision <b>boring</b> machine with some reasonable assumptions and simplicities as an example, the finite element analysis model of spindle thermal characteristics is analyzed with virtual prototyping, and the static/transient temperature field and thermal-structure field are calculated using ABAQUS software. The characteristics of heat flow and thermal deformation within the spindle are analyzed according to the simulation results. The research results provide a theoretical foundation for reasonable arrangement and optimal design to reduce radial and axial deformation of the spindle head, temperature controlling, and the error compensation to the precision machining tool...|$|R
40|$|A finite {{elements}} method (FEM) -analysis {{has been carried}} out with the purpose to study dynamics of carrying system in a machine tool of unique height. This is a one-off machine with high traveling column and a support with horizontal slide can move vertically along the column. <b>Spindle</b> milling and <b>boring</b> units are mounted telescopically at slide butt end. The FEM-analysis of the machine tool has been made due to its renovation. Machine resonances, responses to cutting force, static and dynamic rigidity in spindles have been estimated in the paper. The machine carrying system is subtle, heavy and structurally complicated. Its structural chain includes a carriage, a column, a support, a slide, spindle units interconnected with the help of hydro-static guides. While varying main parameters their influence on rigidity has been investigated in the paper. Height of  support lifting, column material and rigidity of longitudinal drive have been changed during the investigations. Static, modal and harmonic MEF-analyses have been executed in the paper. Frequency-response characteristic of the machine has been constructed in the process of the investigations. Two support bending resonances have been detected in the column at low frequency. Such Due to this there are limits for usage of the machine in sub-resonance and static frequency range. The most powerful resonance has been observed at frequency of 27. 8 Hz. The resonance has manifested itself as torsional oscillations of the column together with the support and the slide. Slide bending resonances have been revealed at higher frequencies 65 – 105 Hz. Three intervals which are fit for machine operation have been determined between resonance ranges. There is a prospective usage of the machine in inter-resonance (32 – 65 Hz) and super-resonance (more than 105 Hz) intervals. It has been shown that rigidity in spindle is a sequence higher in dynamic intervals than in a static interval. Machine subtility can be compensated by its transition to high-speed machining. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The HSK spindle/toolholder {{interface}} {{belongs to}} the complicated nonlinear contact problem caused by taper interference fit. The experiment and the traditional Lame's equation are all not suited for analyzing the contact stress distribution and deformation in the spindle/toolholder interface. In this paper, the contact stress distribution and the deformation of the HSK-A 63 spindle/toolholder interface caused by the taper interference fit were precisely simulated {{by means of the}} finite element method. The simulated results showed that the toolholder shank was in partial contact with the <b>spindle</b> <b>bore,</b> the interference specified by ISO was not enough for the high-speed machining and larger interference should be introduced...|$|E
40|$|Presently, {{the rotary}} wing-head and hub {{subassemblies}} of the Army’s Black Hawk helicopter require almost complete disassembly to inspect failure critical threads {{of the main}} spindle. Even with {{direct access to the}} threads, detection of fatigue cracks in the thread roots is very difficult using visual and penetrant methods. Therefore, the purpose of this project was twofold: (1) to demonstrate an improved nondestructive inspection method for the spindle threads applicable to routine teardown maintenance, and (2) to determine the feasibility of performing safety-of-flight inspections on the spindle with only minimal disassembly. Recent projects funded by the Air Force have shown that the electric current perturbation (ECP) method is capable of detecting very small surface fatigue cracks in gas turbine engine disks 1 and second layer defects in relatively thick structural wing sections. 2 Based on these results, the ECP method was evaluated for its capability to inspect the spindle thread roots not only by scanning the outside diameter (crest of the threads), but also by scanning the hollow <b>spindle</b> <b>bore</b> under the threads and inspecting through the wall thickness for flight-critical cracks. With an ECP probe located on the crest of the threads, high sensitivity to very small defects in the thread roots was achieved and thumbnail shaped EDM slots as small as 0. 53 mm long by 0. 23 mm deep by 0. 064 mm wide were detected. Inspection from the bore requires only that the rotary wing be removed so that a probe can be inserted into the <b>spindle</b> <b>bore.</b> Since this inspection is performed through the spindle wall, sensitivity is reduced and only larger defects are detectable. From the bore, detection of a thumbnail shaped EDM slot measuring 7. 75 mm long by 2. 21 mm deep by 0. 102 mm wide was successfully demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Reducing {{exploitation}} {{energy consumption}} for any technical system {{is an effective}} way, which is in complete accordance {{with the concept of}} sustainable development. The presses, particularly the mechanical ones, are machine tools with a long-term exploitation. At these ones, the operating energy consumption, significant in value, decreases only if the rigidity of the structure of resistance increases, including that of the frame. Several analytical models, developed and studied by the authors, confirmed the hypothesis that a solution to increase the rigidity of a mechanical press with open frame is obtained by shortening it. Moreover, it occurs also a slight decrease in material consumption integrated into the frame, which is a favourable effect. There have been developed more new constructive solutions, characterized by minimal changes to the reference design solution, that of the press frame PAI 25. The new suggested constructive solutions are obtained as 3 D models, accomplished in Pro Engineer Wildfire 4, and the finite element analysis was made in Catia V 5 R 16. The present paper shows results on increasing rigidity and reducing stress state for a few constructive solutions of shortened C-frame, having reduced distance between the working surface of the table and the <b>spindle</b> <b>bore</b> axis...|$|E
