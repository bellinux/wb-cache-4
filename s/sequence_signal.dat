The facultative secretion of PAI- 2 is mediated by a <b>signal</b> <b>sequence</b> proposed to be inefficient by design. We show here that the same internal domain that promotes an inefficient translocation of murine PAI- 2 in mammalian cells is a weak <b>signal</b> <b>sequence</b> in Escherichia coli.
