40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to propose decision indicators to guide the analyst in the optimal definition of an ensemble of superelements in a complex structural assembly. These indicators are constructed based on comparisons between the unreduced physical model and the approximate solution provided by a nominally reduced superelement model. First, the low contribution substructure <b>slave</b> <b>modes</b> are filtered. Then, the minimum dynamical residual expansion is used to localize the superelements which are the most responsible for the response prediction errors. Moreover, it is shown that static residual vectors, which are a natural result of these calculations, can be included to represent the contribution of important truncated <b>slave</b> <b>modes</b> and consequently correct the deficient superelements. The proposed methodology is illustrated on a subassembly of an aeroengine model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of the linear {{analysis}} step of the ensemble Kalman filters (EnKF) in disrupting the balanced dynamics in a simple atmospheric model and compares it to a fully nonlinear particle-based filter (PF). The filters have a very similar forecast step but the analysis step of the PF solves the full Bayesian filtering problem while the EnKF analysis only applies to Gaussian distributions. The EnKF is compared to two flavors of the particle filter with different sampling strategies, the sequential importance resampling filter (SIRF) and the sequential kernel resampling filter (SKRF). The model admits a chaotic vortical mode coupled to a comparatively fast gravity wave mode. It can also be configured either to evolve on a so-called slow manifold, where the fast motion is suppressed, or such that the fast-varying variables are diagnosed from the slow-varying variables as <b>slaved</b> <b>modes.</b> Identical twin experiments show that EnKF and PF capture the variables on the slow manifold well as the dynamics is very stable. PFs, especially the SKRF, capture <b>slaved</b> <b>modes</b> better than the EnKF, implying that a full Bayesian analysis estimates the nonlinear model variables better. The PFs perform significantly better in the fully coupled nonlinear model where fast and slow variables modulate each other. This suggests that the analysis step in the PFs maintains the balance in both variables much better than the EnKF. It is also shown that increasing the ensemble size generally improves the performance of the PFs but has less impact on the EnKF after a sufficient number of members have been used...|$|R

40|$|Abstract ― The paper {{builds on}} the Marxist concept of {{exploitation}} to explore {{the meaning of the}} Post Keynesian notion of uncertainty. Uncertainty is mediated by institutions and is distributed unevenly among different social groups. As different historical social formations entail different institutional structures, the distribution and nature of uncertainty will also differ. The configurations between class relations and uncertainty are analyzed for the capitalist, feudal and <b>slave</b> <b>modes</b> of production. It is demonstrated that modes of production do not only imply specific exploitative relations but also different relative distributions of uncertainty amongst classes. The joining of Marxian and Post Keynesian approaches allows for a richer understanding of exploitive relations and illuminates the full societal impact of uncertainty. It is shown that only in capitalism is the exploited class exposed to a substantial degree of economic uncertainty...|$|R

Furthermore, we resolve experimental controversy by showing that there are no appreciable local nor global spontaneously broken symmetries at finite temperature and that the anomalous spectral features simply arise from two anharmonic interactions.

Recent practice of CI server architecture has some new changes because of the emerging of Docker, the Operating System level virtualization. There are two main solutions of integrating Docker in Jenkins: using slave to spin out Docker container to build inside and directly using Docker container as slave to build inside. The former approach is called Docker Execution mode. The latter approach is called Docker Ephemeral <b>Slave</b> <b>mode.</b> This thesis work is a comparison study of the three modes of CI server: the Master/Slave mode, the Docker Execution mode, and the Docker Ephemeral <b>Slave</b> <b>mode.</b> Both quantitative and qualitative criteria for evaluating CI server, such as build waiting time and ease to configure, are proposed based on previous related studies and my working experience. Based on the criteria, the performance of three modes is compared to see the differences among the three modes. According to the advantages and disadvantages of each mode, the suggested applications of each mode are introduced. This study gets the following results. The Master/Slave mode has shorter build waiting time, easier configuration, and lower memory consumption of the slave for concurrent build jobs with poorer environment isolation, more complex maintenance, and higher memory consumption of the slave for single job running. The Docker Execution mode has better environment isolation, easier maintenance, and lower memory consumption of the slave (both single and concurrent) with longer build waiting time and more complex configuration. The Docker Ephemeral <b>Slave</b> <b>mode</b> has easier configuration, better environment isolation, and easier maintenance with longer build waiting time, higher resource consumption of the master, and higher resource consumption of the slave for concurrent build jobs...|$|E

40|$|We perform {{characterization}} of the pulse shape and noise properties of quantum dot passively mode-locked lasers (PMLLs). We propose a novel method to determine the RF linewidth and timing jitter, applicable to high repetition rate PMLLs, through the dependence of modal linewidth on the mode number. Complex electric field measurements show asymmetric pulses with parabolic phase close to threshold, {{with the appearance of}} waveform instabilities at higher currents. We demonstrate that the waveform instabilities can be overcome through optical injection-locking to the continues wave (CW) master laser, leading to time-bandwidth product (TBP) improvement, spectral narrowing, and spectral tunability. We discuss the benefits of single- and dual-tone master sources and demonstrate that dual-tone optical injection can additionally improve the noise properties of the slave laser with RF linewidth reduction below instrument limits (1 kHz) and integrated timing jitter values below 300 fs. Dual-tone injection allowed slave laser repetition rate control over a 25 MHz range with reduction of all modal optical linewidths to the master source linewidth, demonstrating phase-locking of all <b>slave</b> <b>modes</b> and coherence improvement...|$|R
