50|$|Brassica {{vegetables}} are highly regarded for their nutritional value.

50|$|<b>Sulforaphane</b> (sulphoraphane in British English) is a {{compound}} within the isothiocyanate group of organosulfur compounds. It is obtained from cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbages. It is produced when the enzyme myrosinase transforms glucoraphanin, a glucosinolate, into <b>sulforaphane</b> upon {{damage to the}} plant (such as from chewing), which allows the two compounds to mix and react. Young sprouts of broccoli and cauliflower are particularly rich in glucoraphanin.|$|E

50|$|Plants {{producing}} {{large amounts}} of glucosinolates are under basic research for potential actions against cancer, with the hydrolysis product of the glucoraphanin (the primary glucosinolate in broccoli), <b>sulforaphane,</b> being the best known example.

5000|$|As with {{broccoli}} and other cruciferous vegetables, kale contains glucosinolate compounds such as glucoraphanin, which {{contributes to the}} formation of <b>sulforaphane,</b> a compound under preliminary research for its potential to affect human health.

50|$|Fructans {{are another}} source of {{prebiotic}} soluble dietary fibers. They are often found in the soluble fibers of foods which are high in sulfur, such as the Allium and Cruciferous vegetables. Sources of fructans include wheat (although some wheat strains such as spelt contain lower amounts), rye, barley, onion, garlic, Jerusalem and globe artichoke, asparagus, beetroot, chicory, dandelion leaves, leek, radicchio, the white part of spring onion, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, fennel and prebiotics such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS), oligofructose and inulin. While many of these foods lack in butyrate production compared to resistant starch, {{they do have a}} number of benefits. They generally possess a low glycemic index which appeals well to diabetics. They also appeal to those on the ketogenic diet who benefit from beta-hydroxybutyric acid, which is a HDAC inhibitor which can cross the blood brain barrier and be used as fuel in the mitochondria of brain cells. Other HDAC inhibitors in these butyrate producing foods are <b>sulforaphane,</b> which has promise in inhibiting human breast cancer cells. <b>Sulforaphane</b> has also been shown to promote hair growth in mice, it contains compounds which prevent ulcers, and helps with cognitive function in rats. It is good to note that <b>sulforaphane</b> in broccoli is destroyed if prepared improperly. Diallyl disulfide found in the fructans containing garlic has been shown to reduce chemical toxicity and carcinogenesis in rodents, and shows synergestic benefits with butyrate when it comes to inhibiting the growth of human cancer tumor cells in the colon.|$|E
50|$|German {{research}} in 2003 showed significant benefits in reducing {{breast cancer risk}} when large amounts of raw vegetable matter {{are included in the}} diet. The authors attribute some of this effect to heat-labile phytonutrients. <b>Sulforaphane,</b> a glucosinolate breakdown product, which may be found in vegetables such as broccoli, {{has been shown to be}} protective against prostate cancer, however, much of it is destroyed when the vegetable is boiled.|$|E
50|$|Talalay's {{career has}} been devoted to cancer {{research}} and the achievement of early protection against cell damage. A pioneer in the field of chemoprotective research strategies, Talalay and his colleagues devised simple cell culture methods for detecting phytochemicals which appear to boost enzymes that detoxify carcinogens in the body. This work led to the isolation of <b>sulforaphane,</b> found in broccoli, as a potent inducer of detoxifying phase two enzymes. These findings, published in 1992, attracted worldwide attention as a major breakthrough in understanding the potential link between cruciferous vegetable consumption and reduced cancer risk.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{chemicals}} {{may reduce}} mutagenesis or prevent cancer via other mechanisms, although for some the precise mechanism for their protective property {{may not be}} certain. Selenium, which is present as a micronutrient in vegetables, is a component of important antioxidant enzymes such as gluthathione peroxidase. Many phytonutrients may counter the effect of mutagens; for example, <b>sulforaphane</b> in vegetables such as broccoli {{has been shown to}} be protective against prostate cancer. [...] Others that may be effective against cancer include indole-3-carbinol from cruciferous vegetables and resveratrol from red wine.|$|E

50|$|Glucoraphanin is a {{glucosinolate}} {{found in}} broccoli, cauliflower, and mustard {{in particular in}} the young sprouts. When these foods are consumed, the enzyme myrosinase transforms glucoraphanin into raphanin, which is an antibiotic, and into <b>sulforaphane,</b> which exhibits anti-cancer and antimicrobial properties in experimental models. Preliminary research also suggests that glucoraphanin may slow and prevent arthritis, and 'retune' mitochondrial metabolism. A variety of broccoli has been bred to reliably contain 2-3 times more glucoraphanin than standard broccoli. Consumption of large amounts of glucoraphanin may produce negative effects due to increased creation of reactive oxygen species. However, {{this is based on}} studies on rats fed pure glucoraphanin at a dose equivalent to a human consuming approximately 250 portions of broccoli per day. Other studies have shown glucoraphanin to be safe, even at doses far higher than would be obtained through eating broccoli.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on changing the mixture of keratins produced in the skin. There are 54 known keratin genes—of which 28 belong to the type I intermediate filament genes and 26 to type II—which work as heterodimers. Many of these genes share substantial structural and functional similarity, but they are specialized to cell type and/or conditions under which they are normally produced. If the balance of production could be shifted away from the mutated, dysfunctional keratin gene toward an intact keratin gene, symptoms could be reduced. For example, <b>sulforaphane,</b> a compound found in broccoli, was found to reduce blistering in a mouse model to the point where affected pups could not be identified visually, when injected into pregnant mice (5 µmol/day = 0.9 mg) and applied topically to newborns (1 µmol/day = 0.2 mg in jojoba oil).|$|E
50|$|Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) and <b>sulforaphane</b> inhibit {{carcinogenesis}} and tumorigenesis {{in certain}} circumstances. Their {{mechanism of action}} is proposed to involve inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which oxidize compounds such as benzoapyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into more polar epoxy-diols, which can then cause mutation and induce cancer development. Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) {{has been shown to}} induce apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines, and, in some cases, is even able to induce apoptosis in cells that are resistant to some currently used chemotherapeutic drugs, for example, in drug-resistant leukemia cells that produce the powerful apoptosis inhibitor protein Bcl-2. Furthermore, isothiocyanates have been the basis of a drug in development that replaces the sulfur bonds with selenium, with far stronger potency against melanoma. Certain isothiocyanates have also been shown to bind to the mutated p53 proteins found in many types of tumors, causing an increase in the rate of cell death.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} {{of research in}} nutriepigenomics has focused on nutritional imbalances during gestation and lactation periods. However, foods that are consumed during adulthood can also impact gene expression and disease pathogenesis. Cancer is the disease most commonly associated with adult nutrition and epigenetic modifications. DNA hypomethelation promotes cancer progression by allowing increased gene transcription, while hypermethylation can silence tumor suppressor genes and further promote uncontrolled cell division and tumor formation. Compounds found in foods, such as genistein and tea polyphenols, are able to regulate DNA methyltransferases and histone acetylation in cultured cancer cells and may provide protection against certain types of cancer. [...] Other dietary compounds, such as diallyl disulfide present in garlic and <b>sulforaphane</b> present in cruciferous vegetables, {{have been associated with}} cancer prevention in clinical trials. [...] This may be due to their ability to inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes and prevent silencing of important regulatory genes.|$|E

40|$|Background/Purpose: Cancer {{stem cells}} (CSCs) are deemed as {{the driving force}} of {{tumorigenesis}} in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). In this study, we investigated the chemotherapeutic effect of <b>sulforaphane,</b> a dietary component from broccoli sprouts, on targeting OSCC-CSCs. Methods: The effect of <b>sulforaphane</b> on normal oral epithelial cells (SG) and sphere-forming OSCC-CSCs isolated from SAS and GNM cells was examined. ALDH 1 activity and CD 44 positivity of OSCC-CSCs with <b>sulforaphane</b> treatment was assessed by flow cytometry analysis. In vitro and in vivo tumorigenicity assays of OSCC-CSCs with <b>sulforaphane</b> treatment were presented. Results: We observed that the <b>sulforaphane</b> dose-dependently eliminated the proliferation rate of OSCC-CSCs, whereas the inhibition on SG cells proliferation was limited. Cancer stemness properties including self-renewal, CD 44 positivity, and ALDH 1 activity were also decreased in OSCC-CSCs with different doses of <b>sulforaphane</b> treatment. Moreover, <b>sulforaphane</b> treatment of OSCC-CSCs decreased the migration, invasion, clonogenicity, and in vivo tumorigenicity of xenograghts. <b>Sulforaphane</b> treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the levels of tumor suppressive miR 200 c.
