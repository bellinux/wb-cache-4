40|$|Sean T Martin, Luca StocchiDepartment of Colorectal Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USAAbstract: <b>Sigmoid</b> <b>diverticulitis</b> is {{a common}} benign {{condition}} which carries significant morbidity and socioeconomic burden. This article describes the management of <b>sigmoid</b> <b>diverticulitis</b> {{with a focus on}} indications for surgical intervention. The mainstay of management of uncomplicated diverticulitis is broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. The old surgical dictum that two episodes of <b>sigmoid</b> <b>diverticulitis</b> warranted surgical intervention has been challenged by recently published data. Surgery for diverticulitis thus needs to be tailored to suit individual presentation; patients presenting with recurrent diverticulitis, severe symptoms or debilitating disease impacting patient&# 39;s quality of life mandate surgical intervention. Complicated diverticular disease typically prompts intervention to resect a diseased, strictured sigmoid colon, fistulizing disease, or a life-threatening colonic perforation. Laterally, minimally invasive surgery has been utilized in the management of this disease and recent data suggests that localized colonic perforation may be managed by laparoscopic peritoneal lavage, without resection.

METHODS: In a prospective study on 377 consecutive patients admitted for AD, 265 had NCAD and 112 CAD diagnosed with CT scan. Thirty-six of 265 with NCAD were operated on due to two or more previous episodes of AD. On 188 patients with NCAD followed-up, 35 had further episodes of NCAD and 2 had CAD. On 112 CAD patients, 61 had Hinchey I and were submitted to colonic resection. Twenty-three of 24 patients with Hinchey II were treated with percutaneous drainage.

40|$|<b>Sigmoid</b> <b>diverticulitis</b> is {{a common}} disease which carries both a {{significant}} morbidity and a societal economic burden. This review article analyzes the current data regarding management of <b>sigmoid</b> <b>diverticulitis</b> in its variable clinical presentations. Wide-spectrum antibiotics are the standard of care for uncomplicated diverticulitis. Recently published data indicate that <b>sigmoid</b> <b>diverticulitis</b> does not mandate surgical management after the second episode of uncomplicated disease as previously recommended. Rather, a more individualized approach, taking into account frequency, severity of the attacks {{and their impact on}} quality of life, should guide the indication for surgery. On the other hand, complicated diverticular disease still requires surgical treatment in patients with acceptable comorbidity risk and remains a life-threatening condition in the case of free peritoneal perforation. Laparoscopic surgery is increasingly accepted as the surgical approach of choice for most presentations of the disease and has also been proposed in the treatment of generalized peritonitis. There is not sufficient evidence supporting any changes in the approach to management in younger patients. Conversely, the available evidence suggests that surgery should be indicated after one attack of uncomplicated disease in immunocompromised individuals. Uncommon clinical presentations of <b>sigmoid</b> <b>diverticulitis</b> and their possible association with inflammatory bowel disease are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|AIM Controversy {{continues}} over {{management of}} left sided colorectal emergencies.

40|$|In {{the western}} world the {{incidence}} of <b>sigmoid</b> <b>diverticulitis</b> is increasing, therefore it is impor-tant of better understanding the approach to the management of this condition. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to compare the intra- and post-operative course of patients who underwent laparoscopic sigmoid resection with regard to different preexistent individual conditions. We also compared the operative outcome of patients with <b>sigmoid</b> <b>diverticulitis</b> and those with sigmoid carcinoma. This retrospective study comprises data from 301 patients treated with laparoscopic sigmoid resection in the HELIOS hospital Emil von Behring Berlin between January 2007 and February 2010. 256 of these patients had <b>sigmoid</b> <b>diverticulitis,</b> 45 had sigmoid carcinoma. <b>Sigmoid</b> <b>Diverticulitis</b> Neither different diverticulitis stages nor the age were significantly correlated with the postop-erative complication rate. Patients with increased BMI, however, were found to have a significantly higher total postop-erative complication rate and an increased rate of wound infections. Of note, more than half of the patients included were defined as obese. The operating time and length of hospital stay showed no significant difference between the two groups of uncomplicated and complicated <b>sigmoid</b> <b>diverticulitis.</b> The most important pre-existing risk factor, which was significantly correlated with operating time, was the BMI. Simgoid Diverticulitis versus Sigmoid Carcinoma The patients with sigmoid carcinoma were on average eight years older than the patients with <b>sigmoid</b> <b>diverticulitis</b> (67. 8 versus 60. 1 years). While the carcinoma group mostly consisted of men (58 % men, 42 % women), this was contrary in the diverticulitis group (59 % women, 41 % men). Concerning the BMI there was no significant difference between the two groups. The patients with sigmoid carcinoma had a significantly longer operating time and length of hospital stay; however there was no significant difference between both groups with regard to the total postoperative complication rate or any specific postoperative complication. Conclusion Our data showed that the laparoscopic approach was associated with a similar intra- and post-operative course comparing patients with uncomplicated to those with complicated diverticu-litis. These findings would support the laparoscopic approach for both groups. This is in accord with the results in literature. Other variables, especially the patient’s BMI, did correlate with a higher postoperative compli-cation rate; however, it could be argued that these patients would benefit most from the laparoscopic approach. Beyond that we noted that the outcome in patients with sigmoid carcinoma was not signifi-cantly different to that for patients with <b>sigmoid</b> <b>diverticulitis...</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare open and laparoscopic <b>sigmoid</b> {{resection}} for <b>diverticulitis</b> with the patient and the nursing staff blinded to the surgical approach. METHODS: A total of 113 patients scheduled for an elective sigmoidectomy were randomized to receive either a conventional open (54 patients) or a laparoscopic (59 patients) approach. Postoperatively, an opaque wound dressing was applied and left in place for 4 days, and patients from both groups were managed similarly. The primary endpoints for analysis were (1) postoperative pain; (2) duration of postoperative ileus; and (3) duration of hospital stay (ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00453830). RESULTS: The median duration of procedure was 165 minutes (range, 90 - 285) in the laparoscopy group and 110 minutes (range, 70 - 210) in the open group (P < 0. 0001). The median delay between surgery and first bowel movement was 76 (range, 31 - 163) hours in the laparoscopy group versus 105 (range, 53 - 175) hours in the open group (P < 0. 0001). The median score for maximal pain (assessed by a visual analog scale) was 4 (range, 1 - 10) in the laparoscopy group and 5 (range, 1 - 10) in the open group (P = 0. 05). Finally, the median duration of hospital stay was 5 days (range, 4 - 69) in the laparoscopy group versus 7 days (range, 5 - 17) in the open group (P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic sigmoid resection is associated with a 30 % reduction in duration of postoperative ileus and hospital stay; by comparison, benefits in terms of postoperative pain appear less impressive, when the patient is blinded to the surgical technique...|$|R
40|$|Background: Antibiotics {{are advised}} in most {{guidelines}} on acute diverticulitis, despite {{a lack of}} evidence to support their routine use. This trial compared the effectiveness of a strategy with or without antibiotics for a first episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Methods: Patients with CT-proven, primary, left-sided, uncomplicated, acute diverticulitis were included at 22 clinical sites in the Netherlands, and assigned randomly to an observational or antibiotic treatment strategy. The primary endpoint was time to recovery during 6 months of follow-up. Main secondary endpoints were readmission rate, complicated, ongoing and recurrent <b>diverticulitis,</b> <b>sigmoid</b> resection and mortality. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were done. Results: A total of 528 patients were included. Median time to recovery was 14 (i. q. r. 6 – 35) days for the observational and 12 (7 – 30) days for the antibiotic treatment strategy, with a hazard ratio for recovery of 0 · 91 (lower limit of 1 -sided 95 per cent c. i. 0 · 78; P = 0 · 151). No significant differences between the observation and antibiotic treatment groups were found for secondary endpoints: complicated diverticulitis (3 · 8 versus 2 · 6 per cent respectively; P = 0 · 377), ongoing diverticulitis (7 · 3 versus 4 · 1 per cent; P = 0 · 183), recurrent diverticulitis (3 · 4 versus 3 · 0 per cent; P = 0 · 494), sigmoid resection (3 · 8 versus 2 · 3 per cent; P = 0 · 323), readmission (17 · 6 versus 12 · 0 per cent; P = 0 · 148), adverse events (48 · 5 versus 54 · 5 per cent; P = 0 · 221) and mortality (1 · 1 versus 0 · 4 per cent; P = 0 · 432).

Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients who underwent laparoscopic resection of sig-moid diverticulitis complicated by fistula at a single ter-tiary care institution over a 7 -year period. Comparison was made with a group of patients who underwent resection for diverticulitis without fistula during the same study period. Results: Forty-two patients were analyzed (group 1 : di-verticular fistula, group 2 : no fistula). The median age was similar (49 vs. 50 years, P. 68). A chronic abscess was present in 24 % of patients in group 1 and 10 % in group 2 (P. 40). Fistula types were colovesical (71 %), colovagi-nal (19 %), and colocutaneous (10 %). Operation types were sigmoidectomy (57 % vs. 81 %) and anterior resection (43 % vs. 19 %) in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P. 18).

40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the paper by Evans 1 in which the author demonstrated that a noticeable drop in leucocyte count and temperature over the first 48 -h of medical management predicted early discharge on oral antibiotics. We recently undertook an audit of all patients with acute <b>sigmoid</b> <b>diverticulitis,</b> over a 4 -month period, which supported these findings. Our audit reviewed all admissions to the surgical admissions unit of our district general Trust to improve surgical practice and thereby patient care, focussing on management and length of stay. Of all 33 patients admitted, none developed any complications or required surgical interventions. Further, neither intolerance of oral intake, nor opioid need, precluded discharge — despite this, however, mean length of stay was 3 days. It {{has been shown that}} 70 – 85 % of episodes of <b>sigmoid</b> <b>diverticulitis</b> resolve with medical management, 1 and, fur-ther, Broderick-Villa et al. 2 have shown that the risk of recurrent diverticulitis after initial non-operative management was significantly lower than previous reports.
