50|$|The <b>spruce</b> <b>seed</b> <b>moth</b> Cydia youngana Kearfott {{is found}} across Canada and the {{northern}} United States feeding in the cones of various spruces. Severe damage to white spruce has been reported from central and western Canada (Rose and Lindquist 1985). In Ontario the moths fly in May, {{about the time that}} spruce pollen is shed, and lay a single egg per cone if cones are plentiful. On hatching, the larva initially tunnels in the cone scales and then moves deeper to feed on the developing seeds. In late June, the larva makes a narrow tunnel down the axis of the cone from which it feeds. When full grown in the fall it is about 10 mm long. It hibernates in the central tunnel in the cone and pupates in the spring, the adult moths emerging from the pupal cases in about 18 days. Some of the larvae do not change to pupa in the first spring but remain dormant for 1 or more years. It seems that the number of adults present in any year correlates with the number of cones developed.|$|E

White <b>spruce</b> <b>seed</b> can be tested for viability by an indirect method, such as the fluorescein diacetate (FDA) test or ‘Ultra-sound'; or by the direct growth method of ‘germination'. Samples of white <b>spruce</b> <b>seed</b> inspected by Toumey and Stevens (1928) varied in viability from 50% to 100%, but averaged 93%.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} <b>spruce</b> <b>seed</b> <b>moth</b> (Cydia so-obilella L., Tortricidae: Grapholitini), an important pest in seed orchards of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), can {{make use of}} the spectral properties of its host when searching for flowers to oviposit on. Spectral measurements showed that the flowers, and the cones they develop into, differ from a background of P. abies needles by a higher reflectance of long wavelengths. These differences increase as the flowers develop into mature cones. Electroretinograms (ERGs) in combination with spectral adaptation suggest that C. strobilella has at least three spectral types of photoreceptor; an abundant green-sensitive receptor with maximal sensitivity at wavelength lambda(max) = 526 nm, a blue-sensitive receptor with kr a = 436 nm, and an ultraviolet-sensitive receptor with lambda(max) = 352 nm. Based on our spectral measurements and the receptor properties inferred from the ERGs, we calculated that open flowers, which are suitable oviposition sites, provide detectable achromatic, but almost no chromatic contrasts to the background of needles. In field trials using traps of different spectral properties with or without a female sex pheromone lure, only pheromone-baited traps caught moths. Catches in baited traps were not correlated with the visual contrast of the traps against the background. Thus, visual contrast is probably not the primary cue for finding open host flowers, but it could potentially complement olfaction as a secondary cue, since traps with certain spectral properties caught significantly more moths than others...|$|E
40|$|Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) {{exhibits}} cone crop periodicity, producing seed in a cyclic pattern. Variation in {{seed production}} {{has been noted}} between individuals of a population, but synchronization {{on a large scale}} is common. The theory that ultimately these periodic large cone crops have resulted from the selective pressures of seed and cone predators, referred to as the predator satiation hypothesis, is considered. Assuming predator pressures have operated over evolutionary time to select for periodic synchrony, associations between seed and cone predators and cone crop production levels were anticipated. These potential consequences of predator satiation were examined. Long-term data from 1948 to 1970 of Engelmann spruce cone production levels and small mammal populations, estimated from trappings, were analyzed for positive associations. Three small mammal categories, mice (Peromyscus spp.), chipmunks (Eutamias spp.) and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) were examined. Only the correlation coefficient between population indices for mice and cone crop production was found to be significant. Engelmann spruce cones were collected throughout the summer of a year of low cone production. The impacts and timing of insect infestation were determined in developing cones. The major insects found were western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis (Freeman) (Lepidoptera: Torticidae)), fir coneworm (Dioryctria abietvorella (Grote) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)), and <b>spruce</b> <b>seed</b> <b>moth</b> (Laspeyresia younqana (Kearfott) (Lepidoptera: Olethreutidae)). Insects reduced the survival of cones to 11. 48 cones out of 100. The high percentage of seeds and cones lost to insect predation supported previous studies of a similar nature. Both studies examined the potential consequences of the predator satiation hypothesis which has been suggested as an adaptive mechanism for trees to avoid seed and cone predation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Weather {{conditions}} {{during the}} growing season are determining the size and quality of the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) seed crop in northern areas. Pathogens, fungi, and insects also have an effect on seed crops. The varying quality of seeds from forest stands and seed orchards does not full fill the germination requirements of tree nurseries. Multi-phase pre-treatment are therefore used in forest tree seed centres to improve seed lots quality. The main objectives of this study were to analyse long-term variation in the size and quality of Scots pine seed crops in Northern Finland. Determine the impact of fungal injuries on the structures of Norway <b>spruce</b> <b>seeds.</b> To detect changes in the germination capacity and rate of Norway <b>spruce</b> <b>seeds</b> during pre-treatment phases and to determine the impacts of short-term and long-term storage on the germination of treated seeds. The study found that in most years, regeneration of Scots pine in Northern Finland is limited by quantity as well as quality the seed crop. The long-term average of the Scots pine seed crop was 77 seeds/m 2 and the long-term average expected germination percentage was 61 %. Aeciospores of the inlad spruce cone rust Chrysomyxa pirolata (Körnicke) Wint. were found to form inside Norway <b>spruce</b> <b>seeds,</b> destroying the nucellar layers and reducing germination of seeds. In general, the germination capacity and rate of Norway <b>spruce</b> <b>seeds</b> increased during pre-treatment phases. The germination capacity of seeds increased about 30 % and the rate by more than 40 % during pre-treatment. During long-term storage the germination capacity and rate of pre-treated Scots pine seeds were preserved better in frozen storage than in cool storage. It was found that pre-treated Scots pine forest stand seeds can be stored for several years in frozen conditions. The germination capacity and rate of pre-treated orchard seeds were effected significantly more than those from forest stands. It is therefore recommended that Scots pine seeds from orchards be stored without pre-treatment. The germination capacity and rate of treated Norway <b>spruce</b> <b>seeds</b> from orchards was not significantly different after one year of storage...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCombining {{pheromone}} trapping {{and genetic}} analyses {{can be useful}} when trying to resolve complexes of closely related insect taxa {{that are difficult to}} distinguish based on morphological characters. Nearctic and Palearctic populations of the <b>spruce</b> <b>seed</b> <b>moth,</b> Cydia strobilella L., have been considered taxonomically synonymous since 1983, but more recent work revealing distinct sex pheromones for Canadian and Swedish moths suggest that populations in the two regions belong to different species. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed field trapping using different pheromone lures at ten sites in North America, Europe and Asia, and reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among trapped moths using mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase subunit I) and nuclear (elongation factor 1 alpha) DNA sequence data. Trapping data and tree topologies for both genes revealed distinct pherotypes in North America and Eurasia. A genetically distinct population from China was investigated further with respect to its sex pheromone. Electrophysiological data indicated that Chinese females produce a deviant ratio of the sex pheromone components (dienic acetates) compared to Swedish females. However, trapping experiments in both areas revealed a similar broad response profile in males {{to a wide range of}} acetate ratios, and these populations should be considered taxonomically synonymous. A previous suggestion of an agonistic effect on the attraction of C. strobilella males in Sweden when adding the corresponding alcohols to the binary acetate blend was also tested in Sweden as well as in China, with no observed effect on attraction of males. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the great potential of using pheromone trapping as a tool for identification and delimitation of taxa within cryptic species complexes. Based on our data, Nearctic and Palearctic populations of C. strobilella should be considered different species, and C. youngana Kearfott stat. rev. is resurrected here as valid name for North American populations, which was the case before the revision in 1983...|$|E
40|$|The sex {{pheromone}} of the cloaked pug moth, Eupithecia abietaria Götze, {{an important}} cone-feeding pest in spruce seed orchards in Europe, was investigated. Chemical and electrophysiological analyses of pheromone gland extracts of female moths and analogous analyses of synthetic hydrocarbons and epoxides of chain length C 19 and C 21 revealed (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z) - 3, 6, 9 -nonadecatriene (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z- 19 :H) and 3 Z, 6 Z-cis- 9, 10 -epoxynonadecadiene (3 Z, 6 Z-cis- 9, 10 -epoxy- 19 :H) as candidate pheromone components, which {{were found in}} a gland extract in a ratio of 95 : 5. In field trapping experiments, conspecific males were only attracted {{to a combination of}} 3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z- 19 :H and the (9 S, 10 R) -enantiomer of 3 Z, 6 Z-cis- 9, 10 -epoxy- 19 :H. The (9 R, 10 S) -enantiomer was not attractive, which is in agreement with studies on other Eupithecia species, for which males have only been attracted by the (9 S, 10 R) -enantiomer of epoxides. Subsequent experiments showed that E. abietaria males were attracted {{to a wide range of}} ratios of the two active compounds and that trap catches increased with increasing dose of the binary blend. A two-component bait containing 300 μg 3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z- 19 :H and 33 μg of the (9 S, 10 R) -enantiomer of 3 Z, 6 Z-cis- 9, 10 -epoxy- 19 :H was efficient for monitoring E. abietaria in spruce seed orchards in southern Sweden, where this species has probably been overlooked as an important pest in the past. With sex pheromones recently identified for two other moths that are major pests on spruce cones, the <b>spruce</b> <b>seed</b> <b>moth,</b> Cydia strobilella L., and the spruce coneworm, Dioryctria abietella Denis & Schiffermüller, pheromone-based monitoring can now be achieved for the whole guild of cone-feeding moths in European spruce seed orchards...|$|E
40|$|Cydia Hübner 1825 is a genus of moths in {{the family}} Tortricidae with 231 named species and {{subspecies}} and is distributed on all continents except Antarctica. As larvae, many species feed within reproductive structures, such as fruits, seeds, and flowers, under bark, or within fleshy stems of at least 65 host-plant species including angiosperms and conifers. Many species, including codling moth, pea moth, <b>spruce</b> <b>seed</b> <b>moth,</b> pine seedworms, filbertworm, and hickory shuckworm are considered pests of agriculture and forestry. As a result, the biology, natural enemies, and pheromones of several species have been well-studied. The nomenclature and classification of Cydia has also been well-studied but is less resolved. Nineteen different genus names have been proposed for species in this genus, with Laspeyresia Hübner, and Carpocapsa Treitschke being in common usage until relatively recently. Following the rules governing the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Cydia is the valid genus name for all species congeneric with the codling moth, Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus), the type species of the genus. The relationship of Cydia to other genera in the tribe Grapholitini is a topic of continued debate. Some authors {{have suggested that the}} tribe is an evolutionary grade while others have presented evidence that Grapholitini is a monophyletic clade. Although some secondary sexual characters have been proposed, the genus Cydia can claim no synapomorphies that can be found in all Cydia species. To better understand the systematics and evolution of this group more detailed morphological, molecular, and ecological data are needed for non-pest species. At least 21 endemic species of Cydia are known from the Hawaiian Islands. Males of most species have a ventral pouch below the cubital vein of the hindwings similar to C. latiferreana (Walsingham), C. maackiana (Danilevsky), and several other Cydia species to a lesser extent, although this feature appears to have arisen independently in the Hawaiian group. Larvae, where known, feed on endemic plants {{in the family}} Fabaceae. Identification of species is made difficult by extreme polymorphism of wing patterns for some widespread species and a general reduction of morphological features in the genitalia of male moths, while some features of female genitalia, particularly the antrum and lamella postvaginalis, have diagnostic value. Eight new species of Hawaiian Cydia are described (C. mauiensis n. sp., C. velocilimitata n. sp., C. haleakalaensis n. sp., C. makai n. sp., C. koaiae n. sp., C. hawaiiensis n. sp., C. acaciavora n. sp., and C. anomalosa n. sp.) based on wing patterns and features of male and female genitalia. The thirteen previously known species are redescribed because original descriptions were inconsistent among authors and based solely on wing patterns. Distributions, host-plant affinities, and natural enemies for each species are discussed. A molecular phylogeny of 66 specimens representing 14 Hawaiian Cydia species plus 20 outgroup species was constructed using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA to assess the relative importance of host-plant affinities and geographic isolation in their diversification. Hawaiian Cydia is monophyletic and nested well-within the genus. They appear to have arrived in the Hawaiian Islands after the rise of Maui based on the basal position of several Maui and Hawaii Island species throughout the phylogeny. The earliest diverging species feed on Canavalia and dispersed across the high islands. Subsequent shifts to feeding on Sophora chrysophylla then Acacia koa were followed by speciation and the filling of these niches across the islands. The origin of Hawaiian Cydia remains obscure, but appears to be a separate colonization of remote Oceania from Cydia pseusomalesana Clarke in French Polynesia. It is likely that several more species of Hawaiian Cydia await discovery while several others probably have gone extinct in the 100 years since they were first collected. A broader survey of outgroup taxa from Asia and the Americas, and more informative genes in a molecular phylogeny may help resolve the origins of Hawaiian Cydia...|$|E

40|$|Conifer {{seeds are}} a {{component}} of the diet of many rodents, and post-dispersal seed predation by rodents is often implicated as a critical constraint on the regeneration of coniferous forests. However, {{little is known about the}} effects of conifer seed availability on individual rodents and their populations. The over-arching goal of this dissertation was to investigate the effects and implications of conifer seed production on the foraging and population dynamics of northern small mammals. The predominant conifer study species were white spruce (Picea glauca) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), and the main rodents examined were the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and southern red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi). Nutritional analysis and laboratory experiments showed that <b>spruce</b> <b>seeds</b> are a high quality food source to rodents. Mice were able to maintain body condition on diets restricted to these seeds, and voles were able to use <b>spruce</b> <b>seeds</b> as a sole food source in the short-term. In the field, caching rates of <b>spruce</b> <b>seeds</b> varied with seed abundance, but rodents readily consumed these seeds within experimental patches regardless of abundance. Conversely, fir seeds were avoided by rodents in experiments, as was expected based on their low nutritional value and high concentration of plant secondary compounds. Mice increased food intake and retention of digesta in the caecum to maintain body mass on diets restricted to fir seeds. However, voles did not compensate for this low quality seed-diet, and their body condition deteriorated rapidly. In the field, rodents disregarded fir seeds as a valuable resource for current or future use, even at exaggeratedly abundant seed densities. Given these individual-level interactions, the rodent population responses to conifer mast seeding that I observed were unexpected. Summer mouse densities and breeding varied with previous fir seed production, although this may have been mediated by population responses of invertebrate post-dispersal seed predators to fir seed availability. In contrast, mouse demography was not affected by <b>spruce</b> mast <b>seeding,</b> but likely due to interspecific competition with the North American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), a dominant pre-dispersal <b>spruce</b> <b>seed</b> predator. These results reveal direct and indirect consumer-resource pulse dynamics that require further examination...|$|R

40|$|Understanding post fire {{white spruce}} {{recruitment}} and natural regeneration in mixed aspen spruce {{stands in the}} boreal forests of Northeast British Columbia has proved difficult. Proximity to seed source is generally considered {{to have one of}} the greatest influences on natural regeneration of these forests following disturbance by fire. In order to increase our understanding of the dynamics of recruitment following fire, we measured white spruce regeneration within a 59 year old aspen spruce stand in Northeast BC. One meter wide linear transects, 75 m in length, were established perpendicular to the forest edge seed source: three transects were oriented to the southeast and three were oriented to the west (into prevailing wind). The number of white spruce encountered along transects were counted at one meter intervals along each transect. Remnants and co-dominant <b>spruce</b> trees producing <b>seed</b> within a tree length distance (25 m) of transects were identified to establish internal stand seed sources. No post fire internal <b>spruce</b> <b>seed</b> sources were detected near transects. White spruce regeneration declined with distance from the fire edge for both sampling orientations. Seedling recruitment was negatively correlated to the direction of the prevailing winds. This resulted in more spruce recruitment on {{the eastern edge of the}} stand than the western. However remnants of the original stand or germinant seedlings that maintained co-dominance in the regenerating stand may have contributed <b>spruce</b> <b>seed</b> resulting in internal recruitment. This would result in isolated internal patches of white spruce with densities similar to those found at the forest edge.

40|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} (SMs) are {{organic compounds}} of low molecular mass that represent a vast chemical diversity. In plants, {{one of their}} preeminent roles is their repellent activity against predators. The Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) {{is one of the}} most important predators of conifer tree seeds in boreal and alpine forests in Europe. Its population dynamics and space use are strongly affected by the size of Norway spruce (Picea abies) seed-crops, but not by silver fir (Abies alba) seed-crops. Moreover, squirrel heavily feed on <b>spruce</b> <b>seeds</b> but tend to avoid fir seeds, although the latter has a higher seed-energy content per cone. We tested the hypothesis that a higher concentration of some SMs in fir than in <b>spruce</b> <b>seeds</b> and/or cone scales, the protective tissue of seeds, was related with squirrel feeding preferences. We determined terpene concentrations in the cyclohexane extract of seeds and scales by gas-chromatography-electron ionisation mass-spectrometry (GC/EI-MS), and measured the protein precipitation activity of tannin contained in <b>spruce</b> and fir <b>seeds</b> and scales. Of the nearly 300 separated chemical entities, only limonene, α- and β-pinene and myrcene occurred in all samples and their levels accounted for 80 % or more of all cyclohexane-extractable materials of fir and for less than 50 % of that of spruce. In fir, limonene was by far the most abundant compound, and fir scales had a 13 times higher concentration of α-pinene than <b>spruce</b> scales. Fir <b>seeds</b> had much higher limonene concentrations than fir scales and than seeds or scales of spruce.

Temperature and osmotic stress interacted {{with one another in}} the germination of seeds: the effect of osmotic stress being stronger at + 16 °C than at + 12 °C.

Prolonged white light prevented germination at low temperature and low osmotic potential. Inhibitory effect was less at higher temperatures and higher osmotic potential, as well as after prechilling. Short-period far-red light did not prevent germination of unchilled seeds in darkness. Prechilling tended to make seeds sensitive to short pulses of far-red light, an effect which depended on temperature: at + 12 °C the effect on germination was promotive, but at + 16 °C, inhibitory and partly reversible by white light.

Numbers of juveniles in the Bal-tic region showed no significant relationship with North Atlantic Oscillation index NAODJFM or with regional air temperatures. Timing of postfledging dispersal in the Baltic region underwent long-term change {{during the study period}} and was inversely related to spring air temperature in the region. The date of onset of postfledging movements was inversely related to late sum-mer numbers of juveniles in the Baltic area. Our main conclusion is that after the years wit...|$|R
40|$|Seed {{production}} {{is the most}} dramatic event in {{the life cycle of}} trees [...] and {{is the first step in}} forest regeneration. Embryos of white spruce [...] are fragile during germination, and they depend on vigorous seeds for [...] survival and growth. Mortality of white <b>spruce</b> <b>seeds</b> and seedlings is [...] high in northern forests because climate and microhabitat are often unfavorable [...] for seed germination and seedling establishment. Large quantities [...] of high-quality seed are required for natural and artificial regeneration [...] of white spruce forests at high latitudes. [...] The first chapter of this bulletin describes the reproductive process [...] of white spruce and factors that affect cone and seed production and [...] seed quality. Knowledge of the reproduction cycle and factors that affect [...] seed production and quality of white spruce is essential for [...] forecasting and managing seed crops. [...] Evidence that white spruce is a genetically variable species in northern [...] forests is summarized in the second chapter. This chapter includes [...] recommendations for maintaining the gene pool of natural populations [...] and for seed transfer in afforesting sites that do not have endemic populations. [...] A procedure for delineating planting zones for adapted seed sources [...] is described as an alternative for provisional seed zones that only reduce [...] the risk of maladaptation from long-range seed transfer. [...] The final chapter outlines steps in harvesting white <b>spruce</b> <b>seed</b> crops [...] and can be used as a working manual. Practical procedures are described [...] for evaluating quality and quantity of white <b>spruce</b> <b>seed</b> crops, certifying [...] the geographic origin of seed parents, collecting cones, and processing [...] seeds to mainatin viability for many years. [...] The genetic structure of white spruce and the environment-embryology [...] relationships that effect seed production and maturation have not been [...] studied in detail. The need for research in the areas of genetics, [...] biochemistry, physiology, and ecology is discussed in each chapter. The [...] results of such research will help to improve seed yields and make the [...] management of white spruce crops more profitable in Alaska and Yukon...|$|R
40|$|Pine and <b>Spruce</b> <b>seeds</b> {{are a very}} {{important}} source of food for {{a great number of}} birds and marnmals (SVARDSON, 1957). These seeds are inside a protective structure, the cone. Every cone has a variable number of edible seeds and also an indeterminate number of aborted ones. Birds, in general, spend an important part of their time collecting food; therefore it should be to their advantage to be aMe to disminate a pn'ori between edible and abort-ed pine seeds. Three species of birds (Cor-vidae) have been described as having this ability: the Piñon Jay (Gymnorhinus cyano...|$|R
50|$|Seed {{dormancy}} is {{a complex}} phenomenon and is not always consistent within species. Cold stratification of white <b>spruce</b> <b>seed</b> to break dormancy has been specified as a requirement, but Heit (1961) and Hellum (1968) regarded stratification as unnecessary. Cone handling and storage conditions affect dormancy in that cold, humid storage (5 °C, 75% to 95% relative humidity) of the cones prior to extraction seemingly eliminated dormancy by overcoming the need to stratify. Periods of cold, damp weather {{during the period of}} cone storage might provide natural cold (stratification) treatment. Once dormancy was removed in cone storage, subsequent kiln-drying and seed storage did not reactivate dormancy.|$|R
