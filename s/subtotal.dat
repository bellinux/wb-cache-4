25|$|Radiation therapy {{often is}} {{considered}} for WHO grade I meningiomas after <b>subtotal</b> (incomplete) tumor resections. The clinical decision to irradiate after a <b>subtotal</b> resection is somewhat controversial, as no class I randomized, controlled trials {{exist on the}} subject. Numerous retrospective studies, however, have suggested strongly that the addition of postoperative radiation to incomplete resections improves both progression-free survival (i.e. prevents tumor recurrence) and improves overall survival.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 2001, The Peter Wolfe and Wes Colley/Atlanta Journal-Constitution {{computer}} rankings {{were used}} {{in place of the}} NYT and Dunkel rankings. The change was made because the BCS wanted computer rankings that did not depend heavily on margin of victory. The highest and lowest rankings were discarded, and the remainder averaged. A team's poll average, computer average, strength of schedule points, and losses were added to create a <b>subtotal.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Subtotal</b> (supracervical) {{hysterectomy}} {{was originally}} proposed {{with the expectation}} that it may improve sexual functioning after hysterectomy, it has been postulated that removing the cervix causes excessive neurologic and anatomic disruption, thus leading to vaginal shortening, vaginal vault prolapse, and vaginal cuff granulations. These theoretical advantages were not confirmed in practice, but other advantages over total hysterectomy emerged. The principal disadvantage is that risk of cervical cancer is not eliminated and women may continue cyclical bleeding (although substantially less than before the surgery).|$|E
25|$|In {{their study}} The Louisiana Election of 1960, William C. Havard, Rudolf Heberle, and Perry H. Howard {{demonstrated}} that Davis built his second-primary victory by narrowly edging Morrison {{in the eastern}} and western extremities of south Louisiana. Davis secured the backing of organized labor and made inroads among the white, urban working class, {{which would have been}} essential to a Morrison victory. In the seven urban industrial parishes, which then comprised some 46.5 percent of the total turnout, Davis topped Morrison by 7,368 votes (50.8 percent) of the 419,537 applicable <b>subtotal.</b> Morrison polled 60 percent in his own Orleans Parish and 54.6 percent in adjacent suburban Jefferson Parish, but in the industrial strip and in less Roman Catholic areas, Morrison slipped. The second primary attracted 57,744 more votes than the initial stage of balloting, and analysts indicated that the lion's share of the additional ballots were segregationists who backed Davis.|$|E

25|$|Most hysterectomies in the United States {{are done}} via {{laparotomy}} (abdominal incision, {{not to be}} confused with laparoscopy). A transverse (Pfannenstiel) incision is made through the abdominal wall, usually above the pubic bone, as close to the upper hair line of the individual's lower pelvis as possible, similar to the incision made for a caesarean section. This technique allows physicians the greatest access to the reproductive structures and is normally done for removal of the entire reproductive complex. The recovery time for an open hysterectomy is 4–6 weeks and sometimes longer due to the need to cut through the abdominal wall. Historically, the biggest problem with this technique was infections, but infection rates are well-controlled and not a major concern in modern medical practice. An open hysterectomy provides the most effective way to explore the abdominal cavity and perform complicated surgeries. Before the refinement of the vaginal and laparoscopic vaginal techniques it was also the only possibility to achieve <b>subtotal</b> hysterectomy, meanwhile vaginal route is the preferable technique in most circumstances.|$|E
500|$|The law {{has caused}} a {{significant}} reduction in the number and percentage of people without health insurance. The CDC reported that the percentage of people without health insurance fell from 16.0% in 2010 to 8.9% during the January–June 2016 period. The uninsured rate dropped in every congressional district in the U.S. between 2013 and 2015. [...] The Congressional Budget Office reported in March 2016 that there were approximately 12 million people covered by the exchanges (10 million of whom received subsidies to help pay for insurance) and 11 million made eligible for Medicaid by the law, a <b>subtotal</b> of 23 million people. An additional 1 million were covered by the ACA's [...] "Basic Health Program," [...] for a total of 24 million. CBO also estimated that the ACA would reduce the net number of uninsured by 22 million in 2016, using a slightly different computation for the above figures totaling ACA coverage of 26 million, less 4 million for reductions in [...] "employment-based coverage" [...] and [...] "non-group and other coverage." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also in 2001, {{a quality}} win {{component}} was added. If a team beat a team {{which was in}} the top 15 in the BCS standings, a range of 1.5 to [...]1 points was subtracted from their total. Beating the No. 1 ranked team resulted in a subtraction of 1.5-point, beating the No. 2 team resulted in a deduction of 1.4 points, and so on. Beating the No. 15 ranked team would have resulted in a deduction of [...]1 points. A team would only be awarded for a quality win once if it beat a Top 10 team more than once (such as in the regular season and a conference championship game), and quality wins were determined using a team's current <b>subtotal,</b> not the ranking when the game was played. The <b>subtotal</b> ranks were used to determine quality win deductions to create a team's final score.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the provincial}} budget {{released}} 18 April 2012, the Government of Prince Edward Island {{announced plans to}} introduce a 14% HST to be implemented on 1 April 2013. [...] This would reduce Prince Edward Island's provincial sales tax component from 10% to 9%. [...] It {{should be noted that}} the Government of Prince Edward Island was unique amongst Canadian provinces in that it [...] "taxed the GST". [...] Since the implementation of the federal GST in 1990, PEI's 10% PST has been charged on the <b>subtotal</b> of goods which included the federal GST; PST was not charged on services. [...] This resulted in a combined tax of 17.7% for goods purchased before the 7% GST was reduced to 6% and then 5% in 2006 and 2008 respectively. [...] As of 2012, consumers in PEI paid a combined 15.5% tax rate (5% GST and 10% PST applied to the <b>subtotal).</b> [...] The provincial government committed to exempting some items while critics noted that electricity would see an increase from 5% GST to 14% HST; prior to the HST, electricity was not taxed by the PST.|$|E
2500|$|When {{viewed with}} MRI, glioblastomas often appear as ring-enhancing lesions. [...] The {{appearance}} is not specific, however, as other lesions such as abscess, metastasis, tumefactive multiple sclerosis, and other entities {{may have a}} similar appearance. Definitive diagnosis of a suspected GBM on CT or MRI requires a stereotactic biopsy or a craniotomy with tumor resection and pathologic confirmation. [...] Because the tumor grade {{is based upon the}} most malignant portion of the tumor, biopsy or <b>subtotal</b> tumor resection can result in undergrading of the lesion. Imaging of tumor blood flow using perfusion MRI and measuring tumor metabolite concentration with MR spectroscopy may add value to standard MRI in select cases by showing increased relative cerebral blood volume and increased choline peak respectively, but pathology remains the gold standard for diagnosis and molecular characterization.|$|E

5000|$|The Sushruta Samhita states, per Hoernle translation, that [...] "the {{professors of}} Ayurveda speak of {{three hundred and}} sixty bones, but books on Salya-Shastra (surgical science) know of only three hundred".

Polybius' <b>subtotals,</b> however, are garbled, as he divides them into two sections, troops actually deployed and those registered as available.
