The researcher used Classroom Action Research (CAR). The data are quoted from the observation, test, and interview. The procedures of research are: planning, implementing, observing, and reflecting. To examine whether teaching pronunciation can improve students’ pronunciation, the researcher gives some tests namely pre-test and posttest. Each test consists of 20 items. In pre-test the highest <b>score</b> <b>is</b> 65, the lowest <b>score</b> <b>is</b> 40, and mean <b>score</b> <b>is</b> 53.

Declaring is allowed until the last two cards are left in the stock (the last faced-down card, and the faced-up trump below it).

When the round is over, the players start to count their scores (see Scoring below).

Classroom instruction is Socratic discussion. Considerable writing is required, including two comprehensive examinations and a senior thesis.

5|$|On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, {{water quality}} scores {{can vary from}} 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal).

5|$|The golden point, {{a sudden}} death {{overtime}} system, {{is used to}} resolve drawn rugby league matches in the National Rugby League, Australasia's top competition in the sport. The term is borrowed from the golden goal system formerly employed in association football (soccer). The golden point is used to determine a winner when <b>scores</b> <b>are</b> level {{at the end of}} regular time. Prior to its introduction into the National Rugby League competition {{at the beginning of the}} 2003 season, normal season games were left as draws; in finals matches, 20 minutes extra time ensued (10 minutes each way), with a replay in the event of a draw. If the <b>scores</b> <b>are</b> level at the end of 80 minutes, 5 minutes are played, the teams swap ends with no break, and a further 5 minutes are played. Any score (try, penalty goal, or field goal) in this 10-minute period secures a win for the scoring team, and the game ends at that point. If the scoring event is a try, no conversion is attempted. If no further scoring occurs, the game is drawn and each team receives one competition point.|$|E
5|$|The {{interview}} and speech events are {{graded by two}} to three judges. The scores from the judges are averaged to give a maximum of 1,000 points per event. The essay is graded with a rubric and is read by two different judges whose <b>scores</b> <b>are</b> then averaged. If {{the difference between the}} judges' scores differs by 200 points or more, then a third reader is asked to grade the student's essay. The two scores that are closest in value are averaged to give the final score.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the game is to get the highest score. There are two play modes: Zen and Core. There is a 90-second time limit in Zen mode. In Core mode, players play until the screen fills with poorly placed tetrominos, similar to Tetris. Core has two difficulties. On the easiest difficulty, three-letter words suffice, but harder modes require five-letter words at a minimum. A score {{multiplier}} grows as players maintain a combo of multiple words created in succession, and resets if players are too slow. <b>Scores</b> <b>are</b> uploaded to Game Center.|$|E
5|$|The {{selection}} process differs by country, but it often {{consists of a}} series of tests which admit fewer students at each progressing test.

Contestants must be under the age of 20 and must not be registered at any tertiary institution. Subject to these conditions, an individual may participate any number of times in the IMO.|$|E

When Ryan's mother, Dawn (Daphne Ashbrook), collects Ryan, Sandy gives his business card to the boy. At home in Chino, Dawn asks Ryan to leave, and her boyfriend, A.J.

5|$|Academic Decathlon is {{designed}} to include students from all achievement levels. Teams generally consist of nine members, who are divided into three divisions based on grade point average: Honors (3.75–4.00 GPA), Scholastic (3.00–3.74 GPA), and Varsity (0.00–2.99 GPA). Each team member competes in all ten events against other students {{in his or her}} division, and team <b>scores</b> <b>are</b> calculated using the top two overall individual scores from each team in all three divisions. Gold, silver, and bronze medals are awarded for individual events and for overall scores. To earn a spot at the national competition in April, teams must advance through local, regional, and state competitions, though some levels of competition may be bypassed for smaller states. Online competitions, separated into small, medium, and large categories, are also offered. USAD has expanded to include an International Academic Decathlon and has created an Academic Pentathlon for middle schools.|$|E
5|$|Burnout 3 {{supports}} split-screen multiplayer {{and online}} multiplayer. Five different game modes {{can be played}} online in the game. Impact Time is disabled in multiplayer and the gameplay is some modes is tweaked. Single Race {{is analogous to the}} single-player version except AI drivers are replaced with other players. Online Road Rage functions differently to the offline mode. The online version is a team-based mode that supports up six players and the objective is to destroy the rival team's cars before a certain number of miles have been driven. The remaining three modes are variations on the Crash mode that can be played online and locally. Team Crush and Double Impact are both two-player modes where both players causes pileups on a Crash junction simultaneously. Team Crush is focused cooperative gameplay while Double Impact is about competing with each other. Party Crash is an eight-player score competition mode where players crash on a junction individually and their <b>scores</b> <b>are</b> compared. In April 2010, online services were shut down.|$|E
5|$|During the Jeopardy! round, {{except in}} {{response}} to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response {{in the form of a}} question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling. If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect, the <b>scores</b> <b>are</b> adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.|$|E
5|$|Flowers and coins, {{as well as}} stars, are {{scattered}} about the game's stages. These are totaled {{at the end of}} each stage and a score is given depending how many of each were collected (a maximum of 30 stars, 20 red coins and 5 flowers). Sufficiently high <b>scores</b> <b>are</b> required to unlock one of the two sets of secret levels. (the other set being unlocked upon completing the game, similar to the GBA remake of the original game) Special character coins are also introduced. Missing from the game are the power-ups of sorts — like the ability to spit seeds by eating watermelons — which were present in the original. The fire breathing ability is retained though: Yoshi can use it when he snags a torch or fireball with his tongue. This allows him to shoot streams of fire up to three times. Keys found in the stages unlock mini-games and doors that would be closed otherwise.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water quality {{monitoring}} and improvement the river is divided into several catchment management areas; South of Malmesbury, Bristol Avon Rural and Bristol Avon Urban. In the rural area 22 water bodies are classified as good, 46 as moderated and 8 as poor. The main reasons for not achieving good <b>scores</b> <b>are</b> pollution from waste water, agriculture and rural land management. In the urban area one water body is rated good, while 12 are rated moderate and one is poor. The pollution from upstream is added to by the effects of industry, manufacturing and other businesses and is significantly affected by physical modifications to the water course. Within the catchment area there are 137 river water bodies and 6 lakes; of these 22 percent of rivers are rated as good ecological status, 40 percent good for chemical status and 31 percent good for biological status.|$|E
