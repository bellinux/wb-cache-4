40|$|The {{smelting}} {{industry is}} one of the most important sources of anthropogenic contamination of the environment today. In the vicinity of nonferrous metal smelters, high concen-trations of toxic compounds (especially metals and metal-loids) have been detected in soils and vegetation (e. g., Ettler et al., 2005 a; Suchara and Sucharová, 2002; Svoboda et al., 2000). In these instances, smelter emissions are as-sumed to be the dominant source of soil contamination (Ettler et al., 2005 a,b). In the vicinity of a Pb smelter, Ettler et al. (2004) found that metals such as Pb strongly migrate downwards in soils and accumulate in mineral soil hori-zons. The form of metal in smelter emissions varies signifi-cantly. The smelter emissions in traditional Hg-mining areas are mainly composed of elemental Hg 0, coming from the vapor produced and emitted by roasting furnaces (Fernández-Martı́nez et al., 2006). In contrast, the emis-sions from Pb smelters are mainly composed of Pb-sulfates and Pb-chlorides, and no specific Hg-bearing phases were detected in fly ash by the mineralogical methods (Ettler et al., 2005 b). Nevertheless, soil Hg concentrations can be high enough to be considered a severe contaminant even in areas polluted by Pb smelting (Rieuwerts and Farago, 1996). Interestingly, little attention has been given to Hg concentrations in soils and vegetation in the vicinity of primary and secondary Pb smelters. This article describes the differences in total Hg concentrations between undis-turbed forest and tilled soil profiles affected by a Pb smelter at Přı́bram, Czech Republic. Mercury sources and the vertical migration of mercury through soils are discussed. Materials and Methods The mining and smelting district of Přı́bram, Czech Republic, is known for its Pb-Ag-Zn polymetallic mineral deposits, which were mined and processed from the Middle Ages until the 1970 s. Since 1974, the Pb smelter in the district operates as a <b>secondary</b> <b>smelter</b> that processes Pb scrap, mainly car batteries (more information on smelter operations is recorded in Ettler et al., 2001, 2005 b).

Lead emissions are a national concern, and lead is the only metal included in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.

The lead NAAQS was recently lowered from 1. 5 µg/m to 0. 15 µg/m, reflecting new scientific understanding that virtually no level of lead in the blood is safe for human health.

40|$|The European Basic Safety Standards (EU-BSS) {{describes}} {{a set of}} NORM (Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material) -processing industries which produce residues known to be possibly enriched in NORs (Naturally Occurring Radionuclides). These residues {{can be used as}} a component in building materials aimed for public usage. The industrial processes, in which the residues are produced, are often complex and total monitoring can be challenging especially when the origin of the used raw materials varies. In this study the NORs present in non-ferrous fayalite slags of a <b>secondary</b> <b>smelter</b> facility, a NORM-processing industry according to the EU-BSS, were monitored daily during a one-month production period. In addition flue dust samples and feedstock samples, known to contain elevated levels of NORs, of the same period were measured. The survey involved the gamma-ray spectrometric analysis of the decay products from the 238 U and 232 Th decay chains, 235 U and 40 K using HPGe detectors. Secular equilibrium was observed for the slags, flue dust and feedstock samples in the 232 Th decay chain, in contrast to the 238 U decay chain. During the month in question the ratios of maximum over minimum activity concentration were 3. 1 ± 0. 5 for 40 K, 4 ± 1 for 238 U, 6 ± 1 for 226 Ra, 13 ± 7 for 210 Pb, 4. 5 ± 0. 6 for 228 Ra and 4. 7 ± 0. 7 for 228 Th for the slags. Even with the activity concentration of the feedstock material ranging up to 2. 1 ± 0. 3 kBq/kg for 238 U, 1. 6 ± 0. 2 kBq for 226 Ra, 22 ± 7 kBq/kg for 210 Pb, 2. 1 ± 0. 2 kBq/kg for 228 Ra and 2. 0 ± 0. 4 kBq/kg for 228 Th, none of the slag samples exceeded the exemption/clearance levels of the EU-BSS and RP- 122 part II, which can respectively provide guidance under equilibrium and in absence of equilibrium. As each NORM-processing industry has its own complexity and variability, the observed variations point out that one should approach one-time measurements or low frequency monitoring methods cautiously. Low frequency measurements should be optimised depending on the discharge of the batches. A follow up of the industrial process and its output can provide important insights to assure a limited public exposure upon application of these industrial residues. Finally a comparison is made with reported data on other metallurgical slags and the use of the slags in building materials is evaluated using the Activity Concentration Index (ACI) proposed by the EU-BSS.

40|$|Heterogeneous {{reactions}} {{mediated by}} fly ash {{are important to}} polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and dibenzofuran (PCDD/Fs) formation. However, the formation of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs) through heterogeneous reactions is not yet well understood. Experiments were performed to investigate the thermochemical formation of PBDD/Fs at 150 - 450 degrees C through heterogeneous reactions on fly ash from a <b>secondary</b> copper <b>smelter.</b> The maximum PBDD/F concentration was 325 {{times higher than the}} initial PBDD/F concentration in the fly ash. The PBDD/F concentration after the experiment at 150 degrees C was five times higher than the initial concentration. PBDD/Fs have not previously been found to form at such a low temperature. Secondary-copper-smelter fly ash clearly promoted PBDD/F formation, and this conclusion was supported by the low activation energies that were found in Arrhenius's law calculations. Thermochemical formation of PBDD/Fs mediated by fly ash deposited in industrial facilities could explain "memory effects" that have been found for PCDD/Fs and similar compounds released from industrial facilities.

Urinary Aminolevulinic acid has validity as a surrogate measure of blood lead level among workers occupationally exposed to lead. This study had therefore assessed the magnitude of lead exposure in battery repair workers of three transport service enterprises. Methods To this effect, a cross-sectional study was carried out on lead exposure among storage battery repair workers between November 2004 and May 2005 from Anbasa, Comet and Walia transport service enterprises, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Subjective information from the workers was obtained by making use of structured questionnaire. Other information was obtained from walkthrough evaluation of the repair units. Aminolevulinic acid levels in urine were used as an index of the exposure. This was coupled to measurements of other relevant parameters in blood and urine collected from adult subjects working in the repair units as well as age matched control subjects that were not occupationally exposed to lead. Aminolevulinic acid was determined by spectrophotometry, while creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, urea and uric acid levels were determined using AMS Autolab analyzer. Results Urinary aminolevulinic acid levels {{were found to be}} significantly higher in exposed group (16 μg/ml ± 2. 0) compared to the non-exposed ones (7 μg/ml ± 1. 0) (p Conclusion Taken together, these findings indicated that workers in lead acid battery repair units of the transport service enterprises are not protected from possibly high lead exposure.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the utility of}} workers' compensation (WC) data in a system for the surveillance of occupational lead poisoning, we reviewed workers' compensation claims for lead poisoning in Ohio. For the period 1979 through 1983, 92 (81 per cent) of the 114 claims attributed to lead met our case definition of lead poisoning. The likelihood that a company had a case of lead poisoning was strongly correlated {{with the number of}} claims against the company. Thirty companies accounted for the 92 cases; two companies accounted for 49 per cent of these. Inspection by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) occurred at 14 of these companies, all of which were cited for violations of the OSHA lead standard. Comparison of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes for the 14 companies inspected by OSHA with the 15 companies not inspected by OSHA revealed that OSHA inspected battery manufacturers, non-ferrous foundries, <b>secondary</b> <b>smelters,</b> and primary lead smelters, but not bridge painters, manufacturers of electronic components, mechanical power transmission equipment, pumps, and paints, nor a sheriff's office where firing range slugs were remelted to make new bullets. Neither the number of cases of lead poisoning at a company nor the size of a company was related to the likelihood of being inspected by OSHA.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (WEEE) into landfill is no longer acceptable in most countries. WEEE contains toxic materials which cause environmental damage when they leach from landfill, but it also contains significant amounts of valuable metals and thus represents a potential resource for these metals. Reprocessing WEEE presents many technical challenges. The combination of metals found in WEEE {{is not the same as}} that found in ores, so the smelting techniques and slag systems that produce good recoveries of valuable metals from concentrates may not also produce high recoveries from WEEE. One attractive option for reprocessing WEEE is to add it to the feed to a <b>secondary</b> copper <b>smelter</b> using the traditional black copper route. Good examples of valuable minor elements in WEEE are tin and indium.

The following specific aims are designed to achieve the study objectives: Aim 1 – To describe the recycling process of recovering refined lead from scrap; Aim 2 – To document pollution prevention and waste management technologies and practices adopted by US stakeholders along the trajectory of LAB and lead product life cycle; Aim 3 – To explore improved practices and technologies which are employed by other organizations {{with an emphasis on}} the aforementioned criteria; Aim 4 – To demonstrate the economic and environmental costs and benefits of applying improved technologies and practices to existing US smelting operations; and Aim 5 – To evaluate improved environmental technologies and practices using an algorithm that integrates quantitative and qualitative criteria.

The materials may contain organic impurities, such as plastic and organic chloride chemicals, and amounts of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) are produced during the smelting process. Therefore, secondary metal recovery industries are major emission sources of PCDD/Fs, {{which may have been}} demonstrated to elicit oxidative stress and to involve the production of plasma malondialdehyde (MDA). Many studies have also indicated that the intake of antioxidants, smoking, age and exposure to environmental pollutants may be implicated to DNA damage or lipid peroxidation.

Chlorine substitution of the formed PCNs was identified and a similar pattern was found in chlorination products starting with naphthalene and chlorine. Furthermore, inorganic chlorine and unsubstituted naphthalene were found in the reaction products, confirming that the formation of naphthalene and the chlorination of that naphthalene could occur and could be suggested to be an important PCN formation route. A detailed formation pathway from naphthalene through octachloronaphthalene is proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis compares mercury {{concentrations}} in 64 samples of stream sediments from the Břehové Hory ore district (Příbram, Czech Republic), where lead and silver were mined and processed. Sampling {{took place in}} May 2003, September 2012 and October 2013 with intention to assess the influence of floods in August 2002 and June 2013 on changes {{of the level of}} mercury contamination in the stream sediments. In all three sampling campaigns, the background concentrations near the headwaters of the stream were about 0. 2 mg Hg/kg, {{as a consequence of the}} weathering of geological units. Because of draining the historical mining and smelting region, the highest concentrations reach 3. 2 mg Hg/kg downstream the Březové Hory ore district. The source of this contamination are probably former ore processing plants and the failures of tailing ponds. Extensive transport occurs especially during flood events and as the result, contamination can occur not only in the stream, but also in the alluvium materials. The main point source of the contamination in the area is the <b>secondary</b> Pb <b>smelter,</b> but its influence on the concentrations of mercury in stream sediment is insignificant. Nevertheless, it is a possible source of the contamination of the stream sediments with lead, cadmium and zinc. The concentrations up to [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This example {{describes}} how the Guide for Developing a Multi-Metals, Fence-Line Monitoring Plan for Fugitive Emissions Using X-Ray Based Monitors (Guide) {{can be applied to}} develop a fugitive emissions characterization and monitoring plan for a primary lead smelter. Primary lead smelters are large industrial facilities that process ore into lead metal. Hazardous air pollutants (HAP) associated with primary lead smelters include lead, arsenic, and cadmium. Ambient lead pollution is a national concern, and lead is the only metal listed in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA). Lead is a potent neurotoxin, with many documented health effects from exposure including mental impairment in adults and significant developmental disabilities in children. In 2008 the lead NAAQS was reduced from 1. 5 µg/m to 0. 15 µg/m, which reflected the growing scientific understanding that no blood level of lead is safe for humans. While ambient levels have fallen dramatically since the phase out of leaded gasoline in the early 1970 s, there are still numerous locations in the United States out of attainment with the 2008 lead NAAQS. Most of the areas out of attainment are located near metals fabrication facilities, primary lead <b>smelters</b> and <b>secondary</b> lead <b>smelters.</b> The ambient lead NAAQS functions as...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{predictions}} of two source-to-dose models are evaluated with observed data {{collected in a}} village polluted by an operating <b>secondary</b> lead <b>smelter.</b> Both models were built up from several sub-models linked together and run using Monte-Carlo simulation. The first model system provides {{the distribution of the}} media-specific lead concentrations (air, soil, fruit, vegetables, and blood) in the whole area investigated. The second model provides an estimate of the concentration of exposure of specific individuals living in the study area. The {{predictions of}} the first model system were improved by performing a sensitivity analysis and using field data to correct the default value provided for the leaf wet density. However, in this case study, the model system tends to overestimate the exposure due to exposed vegetables. The second model was tested for nine children with contrasting exposure conditions. It managed to capture the blood levels for eight of them. In the last case, the exposure of the child by pathways not considered in the model may explain the failure of the model. The interest of this integrated model is to provide outputs with lower variance than the first model system, but further tests are necessary to conclude about its accuracy...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe lead {{concentration}} in the surface soil of a French village, where a <b>secondary</b> lead <b>smelter</b> had been operating for a long time, was investigated. The objective was to define the source term of contamination for modeliing the blood lead Ievels of the children living in that village and comparing the predicted values with the observed data. The {{lead concentration}} was analysed by Inducted Coupled Plasma/Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP/OES) and by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). During the first campaign, 48 composite soil samples {{in the first two}} centimètre layer were collected and prepared in lab for analysis by ICP/OES. Among thèse samples, 23 were also analysed by XRF. In a second campaign, field measurements by XRF were performed in 133 spots spread over the village, 24 of thèse spots being places sampled previously. The analysis of thèse datasets showed that measurements of soil lead by XRF can provide correct estimâtes of the soil lead concentrations measured by the référence method. Statistical analyses showed that ICP/OES analysis gives lower values than XRF analysis. For the samples prepared in lab, a régression coefficient equal to 0, 9 was calculated between the two types of results. Regarding the common places tested by the lab method (ICP/OES) and the in-situ method (XRF), a linear régression coefficient could also be defined between the two datasets, but the régression coefficient was smaller. The larger discrepancy between the two kinds of values may be explained by the spatial variability of lead concentration at a small scale and the différence of soil volume explored by sampling and the in-situ approach...|$|R
40|$|Secondary {{aluminum}} smelting (SAl) processes {{have previously}} {{been found to}} be important sources of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs). It is crucial that the key factors that influence the formation and emission of PBDD/Fs are identified to allow techniques for decreasing PBDD/F emissions during SAl processes to be developed. In this study, stack gas samples were collected from four typical <b>secondary</b> aluminum <b>smelters</b> that used different raw materials, and the samples were analyzed to allow differences between PBDD/F emissions from different SAl plants to be assessed. The composition of the raw materials was found {{to be one of the}} key factors influencing the amounts of PBDD/Fs emitted. The PBDD/F emission factors (per tonne of aluminum produced) for the plants using 100 % (Plant 1), 80 % (Plant 2), and 50 % (Plant 3) dirty aluminum scrap in the raw material feed were 180, 86, and 14 mu g t(- 1), respectively. The amounts of PBDD/Fs emitted at different stages of the smelting process (feeding-fusion, refining, and casting) were compared, and the feeding-fusion stage was found to be the main stage in which PBDD/Fs were formed and emitted. Effective aluminum scrap pre-treatments could significantly decrease PBDD/F emissions. Much higher polybrominated dibenzofuran concentrations than polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxin concentrations were found throughout the SAl process. The more-brominated congeners (including octabromodibenzo-p-dioxin, octabromodibenzofuran, heptabromodibenzo-p-dioxins, and heptabromodibenzofurans) were the dominant contributors to the total PBDD/F concentrations. The results could help in the development of techniques and strategies for controlling PBDD/F emissions during metallurgical processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The first model system is composed of the CalTOX model linked to a recoded version of the IEUBK model. This system provides {{the distribution of the}} media-specific lead concentrations (air, soil, fruit, vegetables and blood) in the whole area investigated. The second model consists of a statistical model to estimate the lead deposition on the ground, {{a modified version of the}} model HHRAP and the same recoded version of the IEUBK model.

40|$|<b>Secondary</b> copper <b>smelters,</b> which {{primarily}} {{utilize the}} waste materials that contain organic impurities, and the zinc recovery plant, which handles mostly fly ash and slag from the {{iron and steel}} industry, are major emission sources of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in Taiwan. In this study, we compared the levels of erythrocyte glutathione (GSH), erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) in workers at a secondary copper smelting plant and a zinc recovery plant {{who may have been}} exposed to PCDD/Fs. Though the PCDD/F levels were higher in workers of zinc recovery plant than those of secondary copper smelting plant, no significant difference was found for serum PCDD/F levels between the two kinds of plants. We observed a significant difference in plasma MDA levels between workers at the zinc recovery plant (2. 54 mu M) and those at the copper smelting plant (1. 79 mu M). There was and a significant positive correlation between plasma MDA levels and the PCDD/Fs levels. In addition, we observed that the MDA levels were not affected by smoking and exercise status. Therefore, the data suggest that the MDA levels of the metal recovery workers are influenced by their PCDD/F exposure. The erythrocyte SOD activity in workers from the zinc recovery plant was marginally higher than that from the secondary copper plant (196 vs. 146 units/ml, p < 0. 06). In both plants, large variations in the MDA and SOD levels were found, especially in the high-PCDD/Fs-exposure group, which may be attributed, at least partially, to the differences in smoking status and the number of cigarettes smoked. Overall, our results indicate a higher oxidative stress in workers of the zinc recovery plant than in workers of the secondary copper smelting plant in Taiwan. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.
