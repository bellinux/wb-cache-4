This kind of mudstone has the character of strong plasticity, swelling with water and very soft, the main reason of sticking is that the mud column pressure can not balance the soft mudstone creep pressure and the creep lead to borehole shrinkage. For solve the problem during drilling in this structure, this paper according to the characteristics of mudstone in this structure builted proper creep equation and creep mechanical computation module of soft mudstone, applied FLAC 3 D software to compute and analyze the creep characteristics, obtain borehole shrinkage rate plate with different depth and mud density, and the safe mud density that can inhibit the creep which lead to borehole shrinkage is given, the results show that for prevent the sticking accident occurred the safe mud density of the two sticking points of the well KL 11 - 2 - 1 / 1 S is 1. 73 g/cm 3 and 1. 75 g/cm 3. the results make significant sense in guiding the <b>subsequent</b> <b>drill</b> of the structure...|$|R

This study elucidates {{the phenomenon of}} heat accumulation for sequential drilling with both Kirschner wires (K wires) and standard two‐flute twist drills. It was hypothesized that cumulative heat {{would result in a}} higher temperature with each <b>subsequent</b> <b>drill</b> pass. Nine holes in a 3 [*]×[*] 3 array were drilled sequentially on moistened cadaveric tibia bone kept at body temperature (about 37 °C). Four thermocouples were placed at the center of four adjacent holes and 2 [*]mm below the surface. A battery‐driven hand drill guided by a servo‐controlled motion system was used. Six samples were drilled with each tool (2. 0 [*]mm K wire and 2. 0 and 2. 5 [*]mm standard drills). K wire drilling increased temperature from 5 °C at the first hole to 20 °C at holes 6 through 9. A similar trend was found in standard drills with less significant increments. The maximum temperatures of both tools increased from [*] 0. 05). In conclusion, heat accumulated during sequential drilling, with size difference being insignificant. K wire produced more heat than its twist‐drill counterparts. This study has demonstrated the heat accumulation phenomenon and its significant effect on temperature.

30|$|For many years, {{this type}} of study was {{practically}} {{the only source of}} information on which exploratory efforts were based, and was even utilized in order to select the most favorable drilling sites. In the case of anticline folds discernible on the surface, many successful wells were drilled in the USA, solely based on the observation of exposed anticline tops. Until well into the twentieth century, these observations were preponderant in guiding exploratory efforts (Hoswell 1934). Other empirically guided exploratory methods were also successfully employed, such as “creekology,” or the drilling of successive wells along a riverbed or creek. If the first well was successful, <b>subsequent</b> wells <b>drilled</b> along the same creek had, in fact, a greater chance of being successful. Even without the understanding that we now have, regarding the geological processes that occur underground, many of those wells drilled followed the tops of anticlines. Those structures weakened surface rocks and facilitated their erosion, thus forming preferential channels for surface water flows. When drilling along such formations, those explorationists were unwittingly selecting the most favorable locations for hydrocarbon accumulations in the subsurface, and, not surprisingly, achieving greater success (Frehner 2004).|$|R
30|$|In the {{previous}} section, we first examined several {{cases in which}} a lateral gas escape was incorporated, but later focused on a case with a solely vertical escape. At present, however, {{in the case of}} Shinmoe-dake, this simplification is not directly justified from observational evidence. We refer to the case of Mount Unzen, where a prolonged dome-forming eruption occurred in 1991 – 1995, and <b>subsequent</b> scientific <b>drilling</b> into the conduit was conducted in 2004. One of the important outcomes of the drilling was the discovery that a lateral gas escape across the conduit wall is not pronounced at a depth of 1.3 km. This is based on an observation of the drilled core that has a low permeability region around the conduit (Nakada et al., 2005). Although no magma-conduit system is identical between two volcanoes, our assumption that a vertical gas escape predominates, is supported. Considering again a stratified flow in an inclined conduit, however, the area of contact between the gas phase and the conduit wall might be larger than in a completely vertical case, and may invoke additional gas escape through the conduit wall. A quantitative evaluation of such an effect {{is beyond the scope of}} the present paper, although it requires future research.|$|R
40|$|Kriging {{can be used}} as an {{interpolation}} {{technique to}} estimate the value of a parameter at unsampled locations. The interpolation depends on the existence of spatial dependency in the space where the parameter has been sampled. This space can be of any finite dimensional size, but is typically restricted to the 3 D spatial (XYZ) or 4 D spatio-temporal (XYZ-time) space. Here we will use kriging to interpolate between observed continuous data values in multivariate attribute space. We will show how we make use of this approach to perform kriging interpolation in a model parameter space spanned by seismic attributes. To the extent that the seismic attributes reflects the underground geology the interpolation will be based on similarity of geology rather than distance in spatial space. In an example from a chalk section of the South Arne Field in the North Sea, we use the method to estimate the distribution of porosity, using seismic attributes as guide. The results are very encouraging as the estimated maps follows known geological features very well. The porosity estimate is supported by <b>subsequent</b> <b>drilling...</b>|$|E

Early seismic sedimentology research mainly focused on discussions of the cases and workflows of overseas marine basins (Kolla et al. 2001; Hentz and Zeng 2003; Zeng and Hentz 2004; Loucks et al. 2011) and established two key techniques: 90 ° phase shifting of seismic traces and strata slicing (Zeng 2011). The concept of seismic sedimentology was introduced in China in approximately 2000, followed by the study of sedimentary facies in China’s continental basins (Dong et al. 2006; Lin et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2010; Zhu et al. 2011). However, few case studies have been reported; geologic researchers in China have mainly explored the applicability of seismic sedimentology for different types of continental basins in China and constructed seismic sedimentology models for different sedimentary types (Zhu et al. 2013). In practice, the existing workflows and key techniques were not fully suitable for the continental basins in China (Zeng 2011; Qian 2007).

The JIP Site Selection team selected three areas to test alternative geological models and geophysical interpretations supporting the existence of potential high gas hydrate saturations in reservoir-quality sands. The three sites are near existing drill holes which provide geological and geophysical constraints in Alaminos Canyon (AC) lease block 818, Green Canyon (GC) 955, and Walker Ridge (WR) 313. At the AC 818 site, gas hydrate is interpreted to occur within the Oligocene Frio volcaniclastic sand at {{the crest of a}} fold that is shallow enough to be in the hydrate stability zone. Drilling at GC 955 will sample a faulted, buried Pleistocene channel-levee system in an area characterized by seafloor fluid expulsion features, structural closure associated with uplifted salt, and abundant seismic evidence for upward migration of fluids and gas into the sand-rich parts of the sedimentary section. Drilling at WR 313 targets ponded sheet sands and associated channel/levee deposits within a minibasin, making this a non-structural play. The potential for gas hydrate occurrence at WR 313 is supported by shingled phase reversals consistent with the transition from gas-charged sand to overlying gas-hydrate saturated sand. Drilling locations have been selected at each site to 1) test geological methods and models used to infer the occurrence of gas hydrate in sand reservoirs in different settings in the northern Gulf of Mexico; 2) calibrate geophysical models used to detect gas hydrate sands, map reservoir thicknesses, and estimate the degree of gas hydrate saturation; and 3) delineate potential locations for <b>subsequent</b> JIP <b>drilling</b> and coring operations that will collect samples for comprehensive physical property, geochemical and other analyses...|$|R
