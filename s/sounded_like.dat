5|$|The game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Rare's video game composer David Wise, his first NES composing job. In a December2010 interview, Wise {{said that he}} found the NES sound board work challenging. He had to first code the HEX values for each note by hand before converting them into subroutines with a computer. Wise recalled thinking that his first NES projects <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> doorbells. He was humbled that others continue to remix his tracks.|$|E
5|$|Olivier {{researched}} the role by traveling to Norfolk, Virginia {{to visit the}} MacArthur Museum, and speaking with Alexander Haig, who had served as aide-de-camp to MacArthur. Haig told Olivier that MacArthur's voice <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> W. C. Fields, and Olivier tried to imitate this. He enjoyed working with accents, and obtained recordings of MacArthur's voice. He was interested in various inconsistencies in these recordings, {{and especially in the}} difference in vowel sounds made by MacArthur. During filming, the makeup process for Olivier took two and a half hours, but after it was complete, he thought he neither looked like himself nor like General MacArthur.|$|E
5|$|The When Harry Met Sally... soundtrack album {{features}} American {{singer and}} pianist Harry Connick Jr. Bobby Colomby, the drummer for Blood, Sweat & Tears, {{was a friend}} of Reiner's and recommended Harry Connick Jr., giving the director a tape of the musician's music. Reiner was struck by Connick's voice and how he <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a young Frank Sinatra. The movie's soundtrack album was released by Columbia Records in July 1989. The soundtrack consists of standards performed by Harry Connick Jr. with a big band and orchestra arranged by Marc Shaiman. Connick won his first Grammy for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance.|$|E

5|$|The team worked {{alongside}} {{artists and}} DJ's for incorporation of songs into the game. Neil stated they brought to artists and DJ's working prototypes {{of the game}} and hardware to show them what the sampled music and final mixes <b>sounded</b> <b>like,</b> garnering interest from these groups. This led to securing of rights from several groups for their songs, though this did occur late in the development process. Mixing with celebrity DJ's was performed either though electronic communications, or at FreeStyleGames' studios or the homes or studios of the DJ's themselves; the team outlined the goals {{of the game and}} requested mixes that emphasized the gameplay featured, but avoided hampering the creativity of the artists.|$|E
5|$|Critics praised Undead Nightmare as a {{model for}} {{downloadable}} content especially in its balance of content and price. Neil Davey (The Guardian) said that it was the best purchase of 2010 at its price range, but staff of the Official Xbox Magazine found the price slightly too high. Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar thought that the game's concept <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a ploy to make easy money without much work, but admitted how wrong and surprised he was at the game's depth. At the time of its 2010 release, the Official Xbox Magazine counted Undead Nightmare among the best downloadable content in existence. The standalone retail disc had sold two million units as of August 2011. No sales figures were released regarding the download pack itself.|$|E
5|$|Writer Darin Morgan had {{pieces of}} the script for a long time, drawing {{inspiration}} from research he had done on hypnosis and a book on government coverups and UFOs that theorized that UFOs are a phenomenon that manipulate space and time, but are not piloted by aliens. Morgan had {{the idea for the}} teaser in mind before becoming a staff member on the show. The narrative style was influenced by a casting session Morgan witnessed where an actor auditioning <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> Truman Capote. From this he {{came up with the idea}} to have a writer covering the case. Capote died in 1984, and second choice Rip Taylor was unavailable, so the role of Jose Chung ended up going to Charles Nelson Reilly. Jesse Ventura was cast as one of the men in black, while the other, which Morgan had originally wanted Johnny Cash for, went to Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek. The role of Lord Kinbote went to stuntman Tony Morelli.|$|E

The palindromically-inconsistent sounds, sometimes subtle, are, nevertheless, real: MADAM, LEVEL, TENET, CIVIC, SOLOS, DEIFIED, and ROTATOR. On the other hand, there exist words which are not palindromes but which <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> palindromes. These are phonetic palindromes. MAIM is a phonetic palindrome...|$|R

25|$|On the radio, Farber became easily {{identifiable}} by his unique combination of drawn-out Southern drawl, intense delivery, verbose prose, and quick wit.

25|$|Tebbetts {{was born}} in Burlington, Vermont, but {{his family moved to}} Nashua, New Hampshire a few months after he was born. Shortly thereafter, his father died, leaving his mother to raise the family.

25|$|The play {{proceeded}} {{without incident}} until the intermission between {{the fourth and}} fifth act, which occurred shortly after 11pm. During this time, the drop curtain was down, hiding the stage, and the orchestra was playing for the intermission. Some attendees in the parquet circle heard what <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a brawl behind the curtain, shouting by men, and the working of machinery; they could easily hear it above the playing of the orchestra.|$|E

25|$|The Smile Sessions is a {{compilation}} album and box set recorded by American rock band the Beach Boys, released on October 31, 2011 by Capitol Records. The set focuses on abandoned recording sessions from their unfinished 1966–67 album Smile which – if completed – would {{have followed the}} group's 11th studio album Pet Sounds. It features comprehensive session highlights and outtakes, while the first 19 tracks comprise an approximation of what the completed album might have <b>sounded</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E
25|$|Later {{that month}} (October 1968), Big Brother {{performed}} at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

Aside from two 1970 reunions, Joplin's last performance with Big Brother was at a Family Dog benefit in San Francisco on December 1, 1968.|$|E
