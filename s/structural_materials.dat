5|$|Boron is {{primarily}} used in chemical compounds. About {{half of all}} boron consumed globally is an additive in fiberglass for insulation and <b>structural</b> <b>materials.</b> The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high-strength, lightweight structural and refractory materials. Borosilicate glass is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. Boron compounds are used as fertilizers in agriculture and in sodium perborate bleaches. A small amount of boron {{is used as a}} dopant in semiconductors, and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.|$|E
5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft <b>structural</b> <b>materials</b> which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{important}} in terms of applying organisational buying behaviour theory to <b>structural</b> <b>material</b> choice processes in the Irish residential construction sector, at a time when as the construction industry is awakening to the benefits and necessity of marketing. <b>Structural</b> <b>material</b> choice processes are explored within a framework developed from the organisational buying behaviour literature including seminal such Robinson, Ferris and Wind (1967), Webster and Wind (1972) and Sheth (1973). The framework proposes three material choice process stages and three levels of participation. The three stages, which are not entirely sequential, are:- <b>structural</b> <b>material</b> selection, <b>structural</b> timber specification and structural timber supplier selection. Each of these stages is envisioned as comprising an unspecified number of related decisions. Participation in each of these stages is explored through the three participation levels:- decider, involvement, and influencer. <b>Structural</b> <b>material</b> choice criteria and <b>structural</b> <b>material</b> related changes are also explored. A study model is presented, which is firmly rooted in the study framework and emerged in its working format during the interview analysis. The mixed-method approach adopted commenced with a dominant interview phase, which explored <b>structural</b> <b>material</b> choice processes on a development specific basis. A range of developments and development organisations were targeted and interviews were conducted with both developers and designers in each of the five subject developments. The less-dominant mail survey phase of the primary research aims to extend the investigation of <b>structural</b> <b>material</b> choice processes in the speculative residential development sector. This survey offered, amongst other things, the opportunity to provide participation level and criteria ranking in the three study generated stages of <b>structural</b> <b>material</b> choice processes. The study provides insight into material choice processes at a time when organisational buying theory is experiencing a significant shift towards relationship based theory. The findings find little evidence of strong development organisation / material supplier relationships to date, however future scope for strategic relationships is highlighted in the move toward new development systems, such as timber frame construction...|$|R

5|$|The {{strengthening}} {{effect of}} forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries {{and the strong}} increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The high-speed tool steels contain between 3 and 5% chromium. Stainless steel, the main corrosion-resistant metal alloy, is formed when chromium is added to iron in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%. For its formation, ferrochromium {{is added to the}} molten iron. Also nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, Inconel 718 contains 18.6% chromium.

25|$|Lightning {{protection}} systems {{are used to}} prevent or lessen lightning strike damage to structures. Lightning {{protection systems}} mitigate the fire hazard which lightning strikes pose to structures. A lightning protection system provides a low-impedance path for the lightning current to lessen the heating effect of current flowing through flammable <b>structural</b> <b>materials.</b> If lightning travels through porous and water-saturated materials, these materials may literally explode if their water content is flashed to steam by heat produced from the high current.

25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{adequate}} cooling, the materials inside of the reactor vessel overheat and deform as they undergo thermal expansion, and the reactor structure fails once the temperature reaches the melting point of its <b>structural</b> <b>materials.</b> The corium melt then accumulates {{at the bottom of}} the reactor vessel. In the case of adequate cooling of the corium melt, the melt can solidify and the spread of damage is limited to the reactor itself. However, corium may melt through the reactor vessel and flow out or be ejected as a molten stream by the pressure inside the reactor vessel. The reactor vessel failure may be caused by heating of its vessel bottom by the corium melt, resulting first in creep failure and then in breach of the vessel. Cooling water from above the corium layer, in sufficient quantity, may obtain a thermal equilibrium below the metal creep temperature, without reactor vessel failure.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the main}} line of {{research}} via tokamaks has been developed {{to the point that}} it is now possible to undertake the penultimate step in magnetic confinement plasma physics research with a self-sustained reaction. In the tokamak research program, recent advances devoted to controlling the configuration of the plasma have led to the achievement of substantially improved energy and pressure confinement, which reduces the projected cost of electricity from such reactors by a factor of two to a value only about 50% more than the projected cost of electricity from advanced light-water reactors. In addition, progress in the development of advanced, low activation <b>structural</b> <b>materials</b> supports the promise of environmentally benign fusion reactors and research into alternate confinement concepts is yielding the promise of future improvements in confinement. Finally, supporters contend that other potential replacements to the fossil fuels have environmental issues of their own.

This pretreatment and separation is performed to remove impurities, however also some of the organic material is removed. The possibility of realising the methane potential of the dry fraction through batch-wise dry anaerobic digestion was investigated. The anaerobic digestion technique used was a two-stage process consisting of a static leach bed reactor and a methane reactor. Treatment of the dry fraction alone and in a mixture with <b>structural</b> <b>material</b> was tested to investigate {{the effect on the}} porosity of the leach bed.
