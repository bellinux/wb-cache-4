40|$|Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) {{is working}} on the {{definition}} of a set of standard end-to-end services that can be used on ground, ground to space, and in space. The ambitious goal of the WG is to define <b>standardised</b> <b>services</b> which allow the construction of space systems using plug-in components that implement those services. The specification of standard services not only allows the rapid construction and deployment of new systems and configurations but also the selection of compliant implementations that are most appropriate for each particular deployment. As one of the expected deployments of the MO components is on-board the spacecraft, where there will need to communicate not only with ground based components but also between onboard components, careful study is required to ensure that the MO standards work appropriately in the on-board environment. This paper discusses the existing European space/ground services, the evolution of these to an MO based approach, the implications of MO based on-board implementations, and how other supporting standards and architectures (such as CCSDS SOIS and ECSS SAVOIR) can ease the transition.

40|$|This paper {{posits that}} {{innovation}} management practices are contingent upon {{the type of}} industry, and examines the innovation management practices in a distinctive set of service firms: production-intensive service firms. Production-intensive services are <b>standardised</b> <b>services</b> produced at a large scale. These services have received little attention from prior comprehensive qualitative innovation management practices research. The examination in this paper is based on in-depth interviews with 21 key-employees in five large Scandinavian production-intensive service firms. The results revealed a number of innovation management practices specific to production-intensive service firms in the four dimensions of strategy and culture, front end of innovation and portfolio management, development process, as well as intellectual and organisational resources. The findings expose that production-intensive service firms {{are less likely to}} have an explicit innovation strategy and they are unlikely to measure the strategic impact of innovation activities. Furthermore, the innovation processes in production-intensive service firms tend to be flexible, although formal descriptions exist. The findings extend knowledge on innovation management practices research and provide useful lessons and implications for managers who seek to develop new production-intensive services. The findings also demonstrate {{that there is a need}} to acknowledge a contingent view of innovation management practices that are receptive to the type of context the innovation occur in...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} whether technological developments can be used in call centre environments to build trust and hence lasting customer relationships beyond the usual focus on efficiency gains through automation. Design/methodology/approach - Draws upon depth interviews with management and staff in three very different types of call centre to critically examine the ways in which caring attitudes and competent behaviour of call centre staff can contribute to building durable bases for customer trust. Findings - While one of the case studies exemplifies a purely economic rationale for call centre operations, the other two demonstrate that a truly optimal application of technology creates a shared system of which customers and employees form an integrated part. Employees' knowledge of the system and the product it underpins are applied in a positive way to create relationships and trust with the customers with whom they transact. Practical implications - Argues that competitive advantage can be gained if the customer perception is of an organisation that is concerned with building relationships based on competence or empathy to meet individual needs - features which stand out clearly in an industry sector often associated with <b>standardised</b> <b>services,</b> "sweatshop" working conditions and control-based management practices focused on a purely economic rationale. Originality/value - Demonstrates that multi-channel environments for customer interaction offer potential for competitive advantage beyond short-term efficiency gains when the convenience of channel choice is creatively combined with competent and empathetic customer service...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of cosourcing – or {{the provision of}} <b>standardised</b> <b>services</b> {{to a group of}} organisations – appears to be on the increase. Based upon economies of scale, and resource based and resource dependency theories this paper presents a decision making framework to help organisations understand why, and for what, cosourcing is appropriate. A case study of the Australian financial services industry was conducted to test that framework. The case study suggested that there are more potential benefits to cosourcing than first envisaged and that these will vary across organisations. Furthermore it was discovered that multiple forms, or flavours, of cosourcing have emerged for the same activity in the same industry influenced by, and accommodating, the differing contexts and capabilities of organisations. Finally the case study highlighted that while the existence of multiple cosourcing arrangements helps mediate dependency on suppliers, dependencies and tensions may develop between the organisations involved in cosourcing themselves – particularly if there is a divide in the roles played with, for example, some, and only some, serving as shareholders in the venture as well as customers of it. In conclusion it would appear {{that it is necessary to}} move beyond a focus on universal motivators and shapers of the cosourcing decision to consider in more detail the specifics of the organisations involved and the cosourcing arrangement planned. The range of benefits and variety of cosourcing arrangements available however also suggest that the potential for cosourcing may be greater than first thought if the tensions can be minimised...|$|E

40|$|Is {{there a way}} for a firm to {{successfully}} balance between retaining clients and selling to new customers? When can new clients be gained through the existing relationships? This paper sets out to study the effects on different kinds of relationship substance within the present business relationships, {{on the number of}} new customers added to the supplier. The conceptual model is tested on a sample of business relationships in professional services. The results show that the relationship satisfaction of present customers (a less embedded type of substance) provides more new customers to the supplier. Satisfied customers create opportunities for word-of-mouth referrals to potential users. Satisfaction also increases retention, while a more embedded kind of relationship substance, organisational change in the customer firm, reduces customer retention, at least in the consulting business. Retention in its turn has a negative effect on the number of new customers to the supplier. The results suggest that a firm’s deep collaboration with present counterparts partly exclude the addition of new customer relationships. The supplier has less time and efforts to invest in new relationships and it gets increasingly difficult to explain what other firms may gain from a similar cooperation. Satisfied clients in referral networks, who have experienced an explainable result, can be a source to add new customers. An implication for management is to select between deep client collaboration on one hand, and widening or renewal of the customer base on the other. Operations with <b>standardised</b> <b>services</b> need to be managed separately from customised activities. The use of referral networks increases if used in the more standardised approach...|$|E
40|$|Part 6 : Human Interaction and Human Factors Driving Future EIS/EDSS DevelopmentsInternational audienceResults {{from global}} and {{regional}} climate scenario modelling predict {{significant changes in}} temperature and precipitation {{during the rest of}} the century. Episodes with extremely high temperatures and more intense rainfall will occur more often. Climate change will affect the urban environment and should be taken into account in long term and sustainable urban planning for adaptation to the new climate conditions. To consider the effects of climate change in today’s planning, tools are needed to support the development of climate change enabled applications. These tools have to support several aspects of application development in the context of EDSS: a) How can the results from climate change models be integrated in today’s applications? b) How to access climate change information? c) How to compare local effects of climate change scenarios? d) How to gain access to downscaling functionality required for local problems? e) How to feed local models with climate scenario data. Or in other words: How to build climate change enabled applications. Within the FP 7 project SUDPLAN, which integrates environmental modelling and software expertise, a system of <b>standardised</b> <b>services</b> and end user applications has been developed. The system delivers long term projections of environmental data for different aspects of local modelling (air quality, hydrological conditions and intense rainfall) based on different climate scenarios. The services are interactive and require input of local observations to improve downscaled projections. This is necessary to support wide applicability as the resolution requirements of local models can be very different. All services are provided through standardized service interfaces. On top of these services, the so-called Scenario Management System (SMS) provides end user components for scenario management, visualisation, model integration as well as wizards to support the relevant workflows and the interaction with common downscaling services. The SMS is based on the geo-spatial application suite CIDS which allows to build decision support systems (DSS) with a focus on using climate change projections in the workflow...|$|E
40|$|Open Innovation—and Open Source as its {{particular}} manifestation {{in the software}} industry—have recently been touted as cornerstones of competitiveness for firms in the new service economy and of value added by public institutions involved in the gathering, processing and publishing of information. Although the basic concepts {{are by no means}} new, a considerable surge in research literature has occurred over the past decade around the keywords of open source, open innovation, value co-creation and both innovation in general and service innovation in particular. Putting breakthrough inventions aside, I consider what exactly open innovation means: What qualifies as an innovation and how is it different from the plain old product or service development? Is open inherently better than closed, and what exactly is the difference between the two? What middle ground is there, if any? Services growing in importance, is open innovation in (software) services different from (open) innovation in software products? Besides, is there any real difference between software services and software products? Particularly, {{what is the role of}} customers in that extended open community around the firm? What is the value that they see vs. the value that the firm sees? In the four research publications in Part II of this dissertation, I am addressing these questions in more detail in various contexts: both from a purely software development and software business perspective and from a more general service development and innovation perspective. The four publications have more specific research questions and detailed implications, in addition to contributing to the general themes outlined above. They elaborate on the following topics: Different perspectives to value co-creation in services and the customer/supplier value construct; Roles of customers in service innovation activities in <b>standardised</b> <b>services</b> with transactional intent; The effect of adoption of open-source tools within a commercial for-profit organisation on the organisational structure itself; and Hybrid open-closed software licensing model as a platform for reverting from commoditised product business to higher-value customer relationships. Beyond the theoretical and practical contributions of the publications in Part II, Part I of this dissertation offers a robust definition of innovation in general as well as a more defendable view of the nature of services vs. goods. In addition it clarifies what the term product means in relation to both services and goods as well as in the software industry—a topic that often causes confusion among academics and practitioners...|$|E

40|$|THE OPERATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF SERVICE CUSTOMISATION LEVEL Customisation {{offers the}} {{opportunity}} for organisations to capitalise on the many potential benefits to both themselves and to clients, afforded by offering a greater choice {{of goods and services}} for customers. Many organisations have implemented increased customisation with the expectation of increased demand and profitability. However a critical analysis of the operational aspects involved in customising services reveals that different levels of customisation have distinct operational needs which render the adoption of different levels of customisation more difficult than is indicated in existing literature. Three distinct degrees of customisation are examined in this study. These are standardisation, medium customisation and high customisation. The study puts forward a comprehensive model which provides an insight into the organisational factors which potentially enable or impede an organisation in introducing different levels of customisation. This model builds on previous studies of factors which impact on the ability of an organisation to deliver customised services. Factors which are included in this model are: (a) the level and type of knowledge, skills and abilities (KSA's) held by employees involved in designing and delivering services (b) the degree of information distribution and exchange between employees and (c) goal clarity for staff involved in delivering the service. Initial case studies conducted in six organisations and a subsequent quantitative study which elicited 101 responses from 21 organisations, revealed that each level of customisation held a distinct configuration of these operational factors. Organisations offering high customisation were characterised by a low degree of information distribution and exchange between employees, a high level of KSA's about the service being provided and low goal clarity for service staff. Organisations offering medium customisation were characterised by a high degree of information distribution and exchange between employees, a moderate level of KSA's about the service being provided and relatively high goal clarity for staff. Organisations offering <b>standardised</b> <b>services</b> were characterised by a low degree of information distribution and exchange between employees, a low level of KSA's required about the service being provided and high goal clarity for staff. By examining the relationship between customisation and the identified operational implications, the study allows us to piece together a multi-faceted viewpoint of the same broad issue, which is answered by the overarching question 'how are organisations enabled to provide different levels of customisation'? This study therefore provides us with a well-rounded insight as to how and why organisations can effectively implement different levels of service customisation...|$|E
40|$|In Australia, {{disability}} {{reforms in}} {{policy and practice}} have undergone significant change since World War II. The nature and impact of these changes have consequences for {{the lives of people}} with intellectual disabilities and their families. While significant gains {{have been made in the}} quality, relevance, function and place of services, many deficiencies persist. The move towards community based supports and services provide the opportunity for people with intellectual disabilities to live and participate in the community. While policy, service, and ideological changes have been significant, their implementation and the impact on the lives of people with disabilities still show many disparities. Often people with an intellectual disability remain apart from, rather than a part of the community. This study explores how service provision, has shaped and influenced the lives of people with an intellectual disability and their families. The time period under review is between 1950 to early 2010. This study is set in the Latrobe Valley, Victoria, Australia; a region which has undergone considerable social, economic and environmental change. The rapid growth of power generation industries in the 1950 s brought great economic growth and prosperity to the region. However, 50 years on, the Latrobe Valley is a shadow of its former self. Through in-depth interviews with people with intellectual disabilities, families, and service providers living and/or working in the Latrobe Valley, and the use of biographies and documentary sources, we gain insight and a deeper understanding into lives lived by the experience of disability. Findings of the study reveal a more complex perspective on disability, policies, and service delivery, and challenge the passive role people with disabilities and their families have often been assigned. Service provision was integral in the lives of people with intellectual disabilities, even in situations where this did not meet their expectations. They relied upon services to support their skill development and the achievement of personal goals, and aspirations. Parents wanted their children to experience ‘an ordinary life’, and sought the support of services to help them in their parenting role, including planning for the future. However, families experienced the service system as unresponsive, uncaring, self-serving, regimented, and inflexible to their needs and those of their children. Families were prepared to accept inflexible and <b>standardised</b> <b>services,</b> where service imperatives dominated over service-users, in the fear that refusing a service would result in no service. People working in services experienced the service system as complex, highly structured and process driven, which disadvantaged service users and their families. They were concerned that the needs of people with disabilities and their families were not being met, and if they were it was just luck. The concerns raised by service providers in meeting the needs of people with intellectual disabilities mirrored those expressed by families. Both families and service providers felt disempowered and experienced cycles of ‘hope and gloom’. The findings of this study support the view that service and professional definitions of need dominate, and the provision of services are system¬-led, rather than needs-led and often fail to meet the identified needs of people with disabilities and their families. How services engage with the complexity of the service system impacts on their capacity to promote the abilities and contributions of people with intellectual disabilities and their families...|$|E
40|$|The integration-responsiveness (IR) {{framework}} {{is one of}} the most widely cited and applied concepts in the international business literature. Like other generic theoretical frameworks it is used to explore and explain the management challenges of all types of multinational enterprises (MNEs). However, it was originally developed, and has predominantly been applied, to examine and explain strategic and organizational dilemmas in product-oriented manufacturing firms. References to the differences between product and service-oriented firms and the generic applicability of the IR framework are surprisingly rare. This paper argues that to understand conceptually both the strategic and operational complexities of balancing between centralised, standardised and integrated organizations versus devolved, differentiated, and disaggregated organizations in the services sector requires a significant adaptation to, and enhancement of, the IR framework drawn from organization theory. The empirical basis for argument is based on an in-depth study of a major airline company, British Airways. Airlines transport passengers between two locations, but beyond this basic service there is a hierarchy of service characteristics that add value to the customer, from the speed and reliability of the journey, the convenience of the location and time of departure, to onboard refreshment options and the cultural appropriateness of entertainment options and personal services. Much of the value proposition lies in the service element, although precisely how much is at the heart of the strategic contest between traditional premium providers and low-cost airlines. This means that key elements of the service are dependent on front-line personnel and rather than being embedded in a product. The tailoring or customisation lies in the actions and behaviour of such personnel and cannot therefore be ‘fixed’ from the centre. Moreover, it changes continually as front line personnel adapt their behaviour at the point of delivery, responding to the ever-changing needs of different combinations of customers and the varying resource limitations of different in-flight situations. Given that this kind of firm adds proportionally more value at the point of service delivery we argue that its competitive advantage rests predominantly on the balance struck between standardised versus differentiated services and centralised versus devolved control over the customisation process. As a result there is more of a premium in the airline industry on developing the kinds of dynamic capabilities that mediate between centre and periphery. These key differences have significant implications for understanding the integration-responsiveness dilemma for service firms. This is something that has been partially explored in the customer services marketing literature but not extensively in mainstream international business studies in relation to core frameworks like IR. We propose that organization theory perspectives can more fully explain and enhance understanding of these challenges in global service firms, when mirrored against the IR framework. This also reflects calls by some of the architects of the IR framework to complement the framework with organization theories capable of explaining the sub-processes that underlie the formal structure of international firms (Doz and Prahalad, 2005). We specifically examine a time period in the recent history of the firm when on-going restructuring resulted in a series of cycles alternating between integrated, centralised and more <b>standardised</b> <b>services,</b> strategy and organizational structures, and more responsive, devolved and differentiated services, strategy and organizational structures. In doing so, we aim to gain a better understanding and explanation of IR dilemmas in the context of a service firm and contribute to approaches for better-understanding strategic and organizational change management. We also reflect on how the IR frame work needs to be adapted or supplemented with organizational theory approaches for studying all firms. The IR {{framework is}} briefly introduced below, followed by a review of the origins, structure and applicability of organization process approaches. We then describe the research design and methodology, justifying the use of a single, in-depth, multi-level case study of British Airways for this research. A time-line showing the main I-R cycles, through a series of CEOs and strategic initiatives at British Airways from 1985 to the present provides an overview of the major changes of the past 20 years. We then examine the development and implementation of a set of strategies in the period from 1997 to 2000 which were part of a push for differentiation and customer-responsiveness. Two major sets of initiatives during this period, one focused on crew training and the other on customising in-flight products and services are discussed in detail to illustrate the real-world complexities of the IR dilemma and the value of the revised framework for understanding these complexities. We deliberately contrast the tangible product and service dimensions of responsiveness, and the intangible expertise and in-flight behaviour of cabin crew to test and extend the traditional IR framework. ...|$|E

Although offering a <b>standardised</b> <b>service,</b> ethnographic study revealed interesting differences in practice and follow-up procedures between the two hospitals. Patients, both verbally and on paper, expressed high levels of satisfaction with the services offered at both hospitals, yet in-depth, qualitative research revealed a more complex picture. The evidence from this research will be used to argue that standard consumer satisfaction questionnaires of health provision are inadequate indicators of patients' experience of health care delivery.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of web {{services}} standards and a service-oriented Grid architecture, it is foreseeable that competing as well as complimenting computational services will proliferate. Current efforts in <b>standardising</b> <b>service</b> interface focuses on how one can execute these services {{in terms of their}} syntactic descriptions. Their capabilities and relations with other service types are only articulated through natural language in the form of documentation. In this paper, we present the ICENI semantic service adaptation framework. We seek to capture the capability of services by annotating their programmatic interface using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) [2] in relation to some domain concepts thereby allowing services to be semantically matched based on their ontological annotation. By inferences on this metadata, syntactically different but semantically equivalent service implementations may be autonomously adapted and substituted. Combining it with familiar high-level programming language, we demonstrate a practical service-oriented programming model...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to previous approaches, Urban Emotions defines Smart Cities {{not only as}} technology-enriched cities, but also emphasises the human factor – Smart Citizens. This {{is due to the}} fact that the question of how people perceive a city and how they feel about it has always been important in urban planning and management. In this paper we present our approach for crowdsourcing physiological conditions and subjective emotions by combining data from technical sensors (measuring psycho-physiological parameters) and human sensors (“People as Sensors” contributing subjectively perceived emotions). Furthermore, we couple this crowdsourcing approach with a technical architecture to harmonise and integrate the sensor data via <b>standardised</b> <b>service</b> interfaces (Sensor Web Enablement – SWE) to allow for generic access for further analysis and visualisation. Finally, we discuss the use of emotion information in urban planning and point out related privacy issues together with a number of strategies to mitigate those...|$|R
