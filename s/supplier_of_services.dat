A software system is being prototyped to demonstrate the concepts. It consists of a set of workflow systems and an automated trader system. The workflow systems reside in different organizations and the trader system acts as an intermediary among the customers and <b>suppliers</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> maintaining information about their offers and requests. The traded services are treated as workflows.

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that the economic relationships between China and her major trading partners have changed over the past 20 years with the industrialisation of China, and the emergence of Japan as a source of investment and network trade in sophisticated manufactures, and the US as a source of finance and investment assets, <b>supplier</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> and an apparently inexhaustible demand for consumer and intermediate goods. Has this changed the size and direction of spillovers in the region, and has it curtailed or eliminated American economic leadership? We use time-varying spectral methods to decompose the links between the two leading Asian economies and the US. We find: (a) the links with the US have been weakening, while those based on China have strengthened; (b) that this is not new ï¿½ it has been happening since the 1980 s, but has now been reversed by the surge in trade; (c) that the links with the US have been rather complex, with the US able to shape the cycles elsewhere through her control of monetary conditions, but the China zone able to control the size of their cycles; (d) that Japan remains linked to (and dependent on) the US; and (e) {{there is no evidence that}} pegged exchange rates encourage convergence...|$|E

We use time-varying spectral methods to decompose the links between six advanced Asian economies and the US. We find: (a) the links with the US have been weakening, while those within a bloc based on China have strengthened; (b) that this is not new - it has been happening since the 1980 s, but has now been reversed by the surge in trade; (c) that Taiwan is more integrated with, and dependent on, the Chinese economy, while Hong Kong continues her separate development based on specialisation and comparative advantage; (d) that the links with the US are rather complex, with the US able to shape the cycles elsewhere through her control of monetary conditions, but the China zone able to control the size of their cycles; and (e) {{there appears to be no}} real evidence that pegged exchange rates encourage convergence; in fact the reverse may be true.
