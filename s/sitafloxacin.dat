50|$|<b>Sitafloxacin</b> (INN; {{also called}} DU-6859a) is a {{fluoroquinolone}} antibiotic that shows promise {{in the treatment}} of Buruli ulcer. The molecule was identified by Daiichi Sankyo Co., which brought ofloxacin and levofloxacin to the market. <b>Sitafloxacin</b> is currently marketed in Japan by Daiichi Sankyo under the tradename Gracevit.|$|E
30|$|Oral <b>sitafloxacin</b> 50 – 100  mg {{twice daily}} {{administered}} for 7 – 14  days {{was effective in}} the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and acute pyelonephritis. All patients tolerated <b>sitafloxacin</b> well. This result supports the use of oral <b>sitafloxacin</b> against such infections. However, further larger studies are required to confirm these results.|$|E
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{effect of}} <b>sitafloxacin</b> (DU- 6859 a), used either singly {{or in combination}} with rifampicin, was evaluated in vitro against Mycobacterium ulcerans. Growth of M. ulcerans was measured by plate counts and the BACTEC radiometric method. The MICs and MBCs of <b>sitafloxacin</b> for M. ulcerans were in the range 0. 125 – 0. 5 mg/L. The values for other fluoroquino-lones were two- to four-fold higher than for <b>sitafloxacin.</b> Combination of <b>sitafloxacin</b> and rifampicin exhibited synergy with five of the eight strains, whereas the combination of ofloxacin and rifampicin resulted in additive effects only.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} and in vivo antichlamydial {{activity}} of <b>sitafloxacin</b> was investigated. The MICs and minimal chlamydiacidal concentrations of <b>sitafloxacin</b> for various species of chlamydia ranged from 0. 031 to 0. 125 μg/ml. <b>Sitafloxacin</b> {{had an excellent}} therapeutic effect on experimental Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia and was more potent than tosufloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciproflxacin, although slightly less potent than sparfloxacin...|$|E
30|$|<b>Sitafloxacin</b> {{demonstrated}} {{high rates}} of microbiological and clinical success in this study, i.e., > 90  %. Kawada and colleagues demonstrated that > 90  % clinical efficacy was achieved with <b>sitafloxacin</b> 50  mg twice daily for 7  days (Kawada et al. 2008 a). In addition, a previous study demonstrated that > 80  % of isolates from patients with complicated urinary tract infections remained susceptible to <b>sitafloxacin,</b> while the rates for levofloxacin and third-generation cephalosporins were lower (Kawada et al. 2008 b). Fluoroquinolone resistance in E. coli mainly develops by mutations of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (Hoshino et al. 1994). The recommended <b>sitafloxacin</b> dosage for treatment of acute pyelonephritis and complicated urinary tract infections was 50 – 100  mg twice daily for 7 – 14  days. The inhibitory activity of <b>sitafloxacin</b> against such enzymes was {{greater than that of}} fluoroquinolones (Okumura et al. 2008; Onodera et al. 1999). The MIC 90 of <b>sitafloxacin,</b> levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin against E. coli clinical isolates were 1 – 2, 16, 16 – 32, and 16 – 32  μg/mL, respectively (Keating 2011). For fluoroquinolone, the maximum concentration (Cmax): minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio and area under the curve (AUC):MIC ratio are appropriate parameters to predict activity and likelihood of developing drug resistance (Keating 2011). A previous study demonstrated that <b>sitafloxacin</b> 50  mg oral twice daily achieving the Cmax:MIC ratio > 5 were associated with eradication rate of 96  % in respiratory tract pathogen. (Kohno et al. 2013) The dosage of <b>sitafloxacin</b> 100  mg oral twice daily achieved a higher Cmax. In addition, mutation prevention concentration (MPC) of <b>sitafloxacin</b> had a lower concentration level than other quinolones. This suggests that <b>sitafloxacin</b> has a higher barrier to developing resistance and the majority of levofloxacin-resistant E. coli remains susceptible to <b>sitafloxacin.</b> Two sitafloxacin-resistant isolates were found in the present study without treatment failure. In addition, a double dose of <b>sitafloxacin</b> was allowed to treat these patients to overcome this effect. Previous studies showed that <b>sitafloxacin</b> was more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against bacteria isolated from Thai and Japanese patients including ESBL-producing gram-negative strains (Tiengrim et al. 2012; Amano et al. 2013; Nakamura et al. 2014; Matsumoto et al. 2012). Nevertheless, drug-resistance {{is one of the major}} challenges in treating these urinary tract infections due to an increased incidence of fluoroquinolone-resistant uropathogens (Czaja et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|BackgroundThe {{emergence}} of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) complex has posed {{a great challenge}} to clinicians worldwide. <b>Sitafloxacin</b> {{has been shown to}} have in vitro activity against pathogens resistant to other fluoroquinolones. However, data comparing the anti-CRAB activity of <b>sitafloxacin</b> with that of other antimicrobial agents are limited. MethodsGenospecies were identified by 16 S– 23 S ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer sequencing. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by an agar dilution method. Isolates with <b>sitafloxacin</b> MICs ≤ 2  mg/L were provisionally considered as susceptible to <b>sitafloxacin.</b> The MIC breakpoint for tigecycline susceptibility was 2  mg/L. ResultsA total of 167 CRAB complex blood isolates (146 A. baumannii, 7 Acinetobacter pittii, and 14 Acinetobacter nosocomialis) were collected from January 2009 to December 2011. Around 90 % of the A. baumannii isolates were resistant to amikacin, cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam, ampicillin/sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. By contrast, the rate of resistance to colistin, <b>sitafloxacin,</b> and tigecycline was relatively low (0 %, 41. 1 %, and 65. 1 %, respectively). The MIC 50 and MIC 90 of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and <b>sitafloxacin</b> were 128  mg/L and > 128  mg/L; 16  mg/L and 64  mg/L; 2  mg/L and 8  mg/L, respectively. Compared with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, <b>sitafloxacin</b> had a significantly lower MIC (p <  0. 001), and the rate of resistance to <b>sitafloxacin</b> was significantly lower than that to ciprofloxacin (97. 9 % vs. 41. 1 %, p <  0. 001), levofloxacin (97. 3 % vs. 41. 1 %, p <  0. 001), and tigecycline (p <  0. 001). ConclusionSitafloxacin has acceptable in vitro activity against CRAB, even against isolates resistant to other fluoroquinolones. <b>Sitafloxacin</b> may be considered an alternative drug of choice in treating CRAB related infections...|$|E
30|$|The most {{frequently}} reported adverse reactions of <b>sitafloxacin</b> included diarrhea and transaminitis (Matsumoto et al. 2012). Diarrhea symptoms were usually mild, as in previous reports (Hooton 2003; Matsumoto et al. 2012). None {{of the patients}} discontinued <b>sitafloxacin</b> due to adverse events. Likewise, no elevation of aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase was found (P >  0.05). Therefore, the overall tolerability profile of <b>sitafloxacin</b> is favorable. A limitation {{of the present study}} is that the sample size was relatively small and there were no comparators. Additional larger studies and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm our findings. In addition, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of <b>sitafloxacin</b> was not addressed. However, the correlation of the inhibition zone diameter of <b>sitafloxacin</b> as determined by the disk diffusion method and the MIC determined by the agar dilution method has been demonstrated (Thamlikitkul and Tiengrim 2014).|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 293 strains of Helicobacter pylori, {{including}} strains resistant to levofloxacin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, or amoxicillin, were examined for in vitro susceptibility to 10 antimicrobial agents. Among these agents, <b>sitafloxacin</b> (a fluoroquinolone) showed the greatest activity (MIC 90, 0. 06 μg/ml), with high bactericidal activity and synergy in sitafloxacin-lansoprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) combination. In a Mongolian gerbil {{model with a}} H. pylori ATCC 43504 challenge, marked eradication effects were observed at ≥ 1 mg/kg for <b>sitafloxacin,</b> ≥ 10 mg/kg for levofloxacin, and ≥ 10 mg/kg for lansoprazole, reflecting MIC levels for each agent (0. 008, 0. 25, and 2 μg/ml, respectively). The therapeutic rates were 83. 3 % for the <b>sitafloxacin</b> (0. 3 mg/kg) -lansoprazole (2. 5 mg/kg) combination and 0 % for either <b>sitafloxacin</b> or lansoprazole alone. The maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of <b>sitafloxacin</b> was 0. 080 ± 0. 054 μg/ml at 30 min, when orally administered at 1 mg/kg. The simultaneous administration of lansoprazole resulted in no difference. In the resistance development assay, MICs of levofloxacin increased 64 - to 256 -fold with gyrA mutations (Ala 88 Pro and Asn 87 Lys), while MICs of <b>sitafloxacin</b> only up to 16 -fold with the Asn 87 Lys mutation. The data suggest that <b>sitafloxacin</b> exhibited superior anti-H. pylori activity with low rates of resistance development in vitro and that, reflecting high in vitro activities, sitafloxacin-lansoprazole combination exhibited strong therapeutic effects in Mongolian gerbils with a Cmax of <b>sitafloxacin</b> that was 10 -fold higher than the MIC value at a 1 -mg/kg administration...|$|E

40|$|Agar {{dilution}} MIC determination {{was used}} to compare the activity of DK- 507 k with those of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, <b>sitafloxacin,</b> amoxicillin, cefuroxime, erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin against 113 penicillin-susceptible, 81 penicillin-intermediate, and 67 penicillin-resistant pneumococci (all quinolone susceptible). DK- 507 k and <b>sitafloxacin</b> had the lowest MICs of all quinolones against quinolone-susceptible strains (MIC at which 50 % of isolates were inhibited [MIC 50] and MIC 90 of both, 0. 06 and 0. 125 μg/ml, respectively), followed by moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. MICs of β-lactams and macrolides rose with those of penicillin G. Against 26 quinolone-resistant pneumococci with known resistance mechanisms, DK- 507 k and <b>sitafloxacin</b> were also the most active quinolones (MICs, 0. 125 to 1. 0 μg/ml), followed by moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. Mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions of quinolone-resistant strains were in the usual regions of the parC and gyrA genes. Time-kill testing showed that both DK- 507 k and <b>sitafloxacin</b> were bactericidal against all 12 quinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains tested at twice the MIC at 24 h. Serial broth passages in subinhibitory concentrations of 10 strains for a minimum of 14 days showed that development of resistant mutants (fourfold or greater increase in the original MIC) occurred most rapidly for ciprofloxacin, followed by moxifloxacin, DK- 507 k, gatifloxacin, <b>sitafloxacin,</b> and levofloxacin. All parent strains demonstrated a fourfold or greater increase in initial MIC in < 50 days. MICs of DK- 507 k against resistant mutants were lowest, followed by those of <b>sitafloxacin,</b> moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. Four strains were subcultured in subinhibitory concentrations of each drug for 50 days: MICs of DK- 507 k against resistant mutants were lowest, followed by those of <b>sitafloxacin,</b> moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. Exposure to DK- 507 k and <b>sitafloxacin</b> resulted in mutations, mostly in gyrA...|$|E

40|$|DX- 619 {{is a novel}} des-fluoro(6) {{quinolone}} with potent activity against gram-positive pathogens. The in vivo {{activity of}} DX- 619 against Streptococcus pneumoniae was {{compared with those of}} fluoro(6) quinolones, <b>sitafloxacin,</b> and ciprofloxacin in a mouse model. Two strains of S. pneumoniae were used: a penicillin-sensitive S. [*]pneumoniae (PSSP) strain and a penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) strain. Furthermore, these strains showed intermediate susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin. In murine lung infections caused by PSSP, the 50 % effective doses (ED 50 s) of DX- 619, <b>sitafloxacin,</b> and ciprofloxacin were 9. 15, 11. 1, and 127. 6 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. Against PRSP-mediated pneumonia in mice, the ED 50 s of DX- 619, <b>sitafloxacin,</b> and ciprofloxacin were 0. 69, 4. 84, and 38. 75 mg/kg, respectively. The mean ± standard error of the mean viable bacterial counts in murine lungs infected with PSSP and treated with DX- 619, <b>sitafloxacin,</b> ciprofloxacin (10 mg/kg twice daily), and saline (twice daily) were 1. 75 ± 0. 06, 1. 92 ± 0. 23, 6. 48 ± 0. 28, and 7. 57 ± 0. 13 log 10 CFU/ml, respectively. Furthermore, the numbers of viable bacteria in lungs infected with PRSP and treated with the three agents and not treated (control) were 1. 73 ± 0. 04, 2. 28 ± 0. 17, 4. 61 ± 0. 59, and 5. 54 ± 0. 72 log 10 CFU/ml, respectively. DX- 619 and <b>sitafloxacin</b> significantly decreased the numbers of viable bacteria in the lungs compared to the numbers in the lungs of ciprofloxacin-treated and untreated mice. The pharmacokinetic parameter of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) /MIC ratio in the lungs for DX- 619, <b>sitafloxacin,</b> and ciprofloxacin were 171. 0, 21. 92, and 1. 22, respectively. The AUC/MIC ratio in the lungs was significantly higher for DX- 619 than for <b>sitafloxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin.

40|$|AbstractAn optimal {{dosage regimen}} of <b>sitafloxacin</b> was {{considered}} {{based on a}} pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK–PD) analysis in patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (RTI). A population pharmacokinetic analysis of <b>sitafloxacin</b> was conducted using clinical data of five clinical pharmacology studies and one clinical PK–PD study in patients with RTIs. The pharmacokinetic parameters in individual patients were estimated by the Bayesian method to examine any correlation between pharmacokinetics and bacteriological efficacy. Efficacy data {{were obtained from the}} clinical PK–PD study, in which 50 or 100 mg <b>sitafloxacin</b> was administered twice daily for 7  days. In addition, an efficacy was simulated for a hypothetical dose regimen of 100  mg once daily. The fAUC 0 – 24 h/MIC and the fCmax/MIC of <b>sitafloxacin</b> at a dose of 50  mg twice daily were 117. 5 ± 78. 0 and 7. 3 ± 4. 7 (mean ± SD), respectively. As a result of the univariate logistic regression analysis, the larger the value of fAUC 0 – 24 h/MIC or fCmax/MIC becomes, the higher the bacteriological efficacies. The eradication rates for fAUC 0 – 24 h/MIC ≥  30 and for fCmax/MIC ≥  2 were 96. 4  % and 96. 3  %, respectively. The PK–PD target values of <b>sitafloxacin</b> for the treatment of mild to moderate RTIs were considered to be fAUC 0 – 24 h/MIC ≥  30 and fCmax/MIC ≥  2. The PK–PD parameters at the regimen of 50 or 100  mg twice daily in patients with RTIs reached the target values.

30|$|Complicated {{urinary tract}} infections and acute {{pyelonephritis}} are relatively common infectious genitourinary problems. A complicated {{urinary tract infection}} localizes to the lower or upper urinary tract and is related to structural or functional abnormalities that may {{increase the risk of}} treatment failure, urinary tract obstruction and urinary bladder dysfunction (Grabe et al. 2013). Acute pyelonephritis is commonly described as an infection of the upper urinary tract that includes fever and flank pain. It is an exudative purulent localized inflammation of the renal pelvis and kidney (Grabe et al. 2013). These are potentially serious infections that require prompt and effective antibiotic therapy. Renally excreted fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, are frequently prescribed for treatment (Hooton 2003). For patients who can tolerate oral therapy, empiric treatment with an oral fluoroquinolone is an optimal treatment. Fluoroquinolones used to previously treat urinary tract infections include ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin (Gupta et al. 2011; Singh et al. 2013). A previous study of 28 hospitals in Thailand showed that 44  % of Escherichia coli isolated from the urine was resistant to ciprofloxacin and found a correlation between the incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli bacteremia and the upward trend in quinolone use in the community (Polwichai et al. 2009). In 2008, <b>sitafloxacin,</b> a potent broad-spectrum oral fluoroquinolone, was launched (Keating 2011). This drug is mainly renally excreted as an unchanged drug (Payne et al. 2005; O’Grady et al. 2001). <b>Sitafloxacin</b> possesses activity against a variety of uropathogens, including E. coli (Keating 2011). Based on susceptibility rates, the activity of <b>sitafloxacin</b> against E. coli appeared greater than that of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. The bioavailability of <b>sitafloxacin</b> is 100  %, and food intake does not affect the pharmacokinetics of this drug to a significant extent (Nakashima et al. 1995). Approximately 80  % of <b>sitafloxacin</b> was excreted in the urine within 72  h of administration (Keating 2011). Oral <b>sitafloxacin</b> 50  mg twice daily was considered an effective dosage in patients with complicated urinary tract infections (Keating 2011). For the patients suspected of having a poor response to the usual dose, the dosage may be increased to 100  mg twice daily and extended to a 14 -day period. To date, data regarding the success rate of <b>sitafloxacin</b> in acute complicated urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis are relatively limited. In addition, the causative uropathogens may vary in each geographic area. Thus, the objective {{of this study was to}} examine the treatment’s success rate in Thai patients diagnosed with acute complicated urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis.|$|E
30|$|The patient sample {{included}} 67  % females; the mean ± SD age was 49  ±  13  years. Twenty-one (70  %) patients had acute pyelonephritis and 9 (30  %) had complicated urinary tract infections. Twenty-two patients were positive for uropathogens. The most frequently isolated pathogen was E. coli 11 non-extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing and 5 ESBL-producing strains. Of the 22 isolated uropathogens, 19 (86  %) isolates were sensitive to <b>sitafloxacin.</b> At day 14, 29 of 30 (97  %) were clinically cured and 21 of 22 (95  %) were microbiologically cured.

40|$|The major {{mechanism}} {{of resistance to}} fluoroquinolones for Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the modification of type II topoisomerases (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV). We examined the mutations in quinolone-resistance-determining regions (QRDR) of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE genes of recent clinical isolates. There were 150 isolates with reduced susceptibilities to levofloxacin and 127 with reduced susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin among 513 isolates collected during 1998 and 1999 in Japan. Sequencing results predicted replacement of an amino acid in the QRDR of DNA gyrase (GyrA or GyrB) for 124 of the 150 strains (82. 7 %); among these, 89 isolates possessed mutations in parC or parE which lead to amino acid changes. Substitutions of both Ile for Thr- 83 in GyrA and Leu for Ser- 87 in ParC were the principal changes, being detected in 48 strains. These replacements were obviously associated with reduced susceptibilities to levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and sparfloxacin; however, <b>sitafloxacin</b> showed high activity against isolates with these replacements. We purified GyrA (The- 83 to Ile) and ParC (Ser- 87 to Leu) by site-directed mutagenesis and compared the inhibitory activities of the fluoroquinolones. <b>Sitafloxacin</b> showed the most potent inhibitory activities against both altered topoisomerases among the fluoroquinolones tested. These results indicated that, compared with other available quinolones, <b>sitafloxacin</b> maintained higher activity against recent clinical isolates with multiple mutations in gyrA and parC, which {{can be explained by}} the high inhibitory activities of <b>sitafloxacin</b> against both mutated enzymes...|$|E

DX- 619 had the lowest MIC ranges/MIC 50 s/MIC 90 s (μg/ml) against 131 Staphylococcus aureus strains (≤ 0. 002 to 2. 0 / 0. 06 / 0. 5) and 128 coagulase-negative staphylococci (0. 004 to 0. 25 / 0. 016 / 0. 125). Among strains tested, 76 S. aureus strains and 51 coagulase-negative staphylococci were resistant to ciprofloxacin. DX- 619 had the lowest MIC 50 /MIC 90 values against 127 quinolone-resistant staphylococci (0. 125 / 0. 5), followed by <b>sitafloxacin</b> (0. 5 / 4), moxifloxacin (2 / 8), gatifloxacin (4 / 16), levofloxacin (16 /> 32), and ciprofloxacin (> 32 /> 32). Raised quinolone MICs were associated with mutations in GyrA (S 84 L) and single or double mutations in GrlA (S 80 F or Y; E 84 K, G, or V) in all S. aureus strains tested. A recent vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) strain (Hershey) was resistant to available quinolones and was inhibited by DX- 619 at 0. 25 μg/ml and <b>sitafloxacin</b> at 1. 0 μg/ml. Vancomycin (except VRSA), linezolid, ranbezolid, tigecycline, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active against all strains, and teicoplanin was active against S. aureus but less active against coagulase-negative staphylococci. DX- 619 produced resistant mutants with MICs of 1 to > 32 μg/ml after 32 μg/ml for ciprofloxacin, <b>sitafloxacin,</b> moxifloxacin, and gatifloxacin. DX- 619 and <b>sitafloxacin</b> were also more active than other tested drugs against selected mutants and had the lowest mutation frequencies in single-step resistance selection. DX- 619 and <b>sitafloxacin</b> were bactericidal against six quinolone-resistant (including the VRSA) and seven quinolone-susceptible strains tested, whereas gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal against 11, 10, 7, and 5 strains at 4 × MIC after 24 h, respectively. DX- 619 was also bactericidal against one other VRSA strain, five vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus strains, and four vancomycin-intermediate coagulase-negative staphylococci. Linezolid, ranbezolid, and tigecycline were bacteriostatic and quinupristin-dalfopristin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin were bactericidal against two, eight, and nine strains, and daptomycin and oritavancin were rapidly bactericidal against all strains, including the VRSA.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of quinolone-resistant Salmonella {{has become a}} public health concern. Amino acid substitutions have generally been found within the quinolone resistance-determining region in subunit A of DNA gyrase (GyrA) of Salmonella Typhimurium. However, direct evidence of the contribution of these substitutions to quinolone resistance remains to be shown. To investigate the significance of amino acid substitutions in S. Typhimurium GyrA to quinolone resistance, we expressed recombinant wild-type (WT) and five mutant DNA gyrases in Escherichia coli and characterized them in vitro. WT and mutant DNA gyrases were reconstituted in vitro by mixing recombinant subunits A and B of DNA gyrase. The correlation between the amino acid substitutions and resistance to quinolones ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and <b>sitafloxacin</b> was assessed by quinolone-inhibited supercoiling assays. All mutant DNA gyrases showed reduced susceptibility to all quinolones when compared with WT DNA gyrases. DNA gyrase with a double amino acid substitution in GyrA, serine to phenylalanine at codon 83 and aspartic acid to asparagine at 87 (GyrA-S 83 F-D 87 N), exhibited the lowest quinolone susceptibility amongst all mutant DNA gyrases. The effectiveness of <b>sitafloxacin</b> was shown by the low inhibitory concentration required for mutant DNA gyrases, including the DNA gyrase with GyrA-S 83 F-D 87 N. We suggest <b>sitafloxacin</b> as a candidate drug {{for the treatment of}} salmonellosis caused by ciprofloxacin-resistant S. Typhimurium. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

30|$|Laboratory parameters, {{including}} complete {{blood cell}} count, kidney enzymes, {{erythrocyte sedimentation rate}} (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and liver enzymes were assessed at the baseline visit and on day 7. The dosage of <b>sitafloxacin</b> was 50  mg per day for patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 to < 50  mL/min/ 1.73  m 2 and 50  mg every other day for patients with eGFR 10  to < 30  mL/min/ 1.73  m 2. The eGFR was calculated by the Modification in Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD). The eGFR MDRD was calculated as the following: 186 × serum creatinine− 1.154 × age− 0.203 × (0.742 if female). Subjects whose initial uropathogens were resistant to <b>sitafloxacin</b> could remain in the study if they improved clinically; in this case, they {{were included in the}} analysis. In such cases, the dosage of <b>sitafloxacin</b> was adjusted to 100  mg twice daily. Clinical cure was assessed by the investigator and defined as resolution of initial clinical signs and symptoms without antibiotic treatment. Microbiological response was assessed according to results of the urine culture at follow-up visits. “Microbiological cure” was assigned to patients whose urine culture demonstrated elimination of their study entry uropathogens. At day 14, patients were assigned a response of “presumed microbiological cure” if a urine culture was not available at day 14 but a microbiological cure at day 7 combined with a clinical cure at day 14 was documented. Adverse events included events reported by patients and those observed as laboratory abnormalities.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{number of}} Salmonella strains with reduced {{susceptibility}} to fluoroquinolones has increased during {{recent years in}} many countries, threatening {{the value of this}} antimicrobial group in the treatment of severe salmonella infections. Methods We analyzed the in vitro activities of ciprofloxacin and 10 additional fluoroquinolones against 816 Salmonella strains collected from Finnish patients between 1995 and 2003. Special attention was focused on the efficacy of newer fluoroquinolones against the Salmonella strains with reduced ciprofloxacin susceptibility. Results The isolates represented 119 different serotypes. Of all 816 Salmonella strains, 3 (0. 4 %) were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MIC ≥ 4 μg/ml), 232 (28. 4 %) showed reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (MIC ≥ 0. 125 – 2 μg/ml), and 581 (71. 2 %) were ciprofloxacin-susceptible. The MIC 50 and MIC 90 values of ciprofloxacin for these strains were 0. 032 and 0. 25 μg/ml, respectively, being lower than those of the other fluoroquinolone compounds presently on market in Finland (ofloxacin, norfloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin). For two newer quinolones, clinafloxacin and <b>sitafloxacin,</b> the MIC 50 and MIC 90 values were lowest, both 0. 016 and 0. 064 μg/ml, respectively. Moreover, clinafloxacin and <b>sitafloxacin</b> exhibited the lowest MIC 50 and MIC 90 values, 0. 064 and 0. 125 μg/ml, against the 235 Salmonella strains with reduced susceptibility and strains fully resistant to ciprofloxacin. Conclusion Among the registered fluoroquinolones in Finland, ciprofloxacin still appears to be the most effective drug for the treatment salmonella infections. Among the newer preparations, both clinafloxacin and <b>sitafloxacin</b> are promising based on in vitro studies, especially for strains showing reduced ciprofloxacin susceptibility. Their efficacy, however, has not been demonstrated in clinical investigations. </p...|$|E
