40|$|A {{multiphase}} {{approach is}} {{considered for the}} design of an aircraft anti-skid braking control system. A four-phase scheme, based on angular acceleration thresholds and estimated slip rate values, is used to stabilize the aircraft system around an optimal braking condition. The change in vertical load due to variable lift force and the ensuing variable tire deflection are considered in the verification models. A hybrid controller is proposed, designed to achieve a stable wheel <b>slip</b> <b>limit</b> cycle. The simulations confirm that the proposed control scheme is a valid solution for the anti-skid of an aircraft main Landing Gear (LG). The actuator time delay and dynamic bandwidth influence on the aircraft stop distance has been studied...|$|E
40|$|The {{test site}} is Arapahoe Generating Station Unit 4, a 100 MWe down-fired utility boiler burning a low-sulfur western coal. The project {{goal is to}} {{demonstrate}} up to 70 % reductions in NOx and SO{sub 2 } emission through the integration of: (1) down-fired low-NOx burners with overfire air; (2) Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) for additional NOx removal; and (3) dry sorbent injection and duct humidification for SO{sub 2 } removal. This report documents the third phase of SNCR tests, where an additional injection location was installed to increase the low-load NOx removal performance. The new injectors consist {{of a pair of}} retractable in-furnace lances which were designed to provide a high degree of load following flexibility through on-line adjustments of the injection angle. With the new lances, NOx removals in excess of 35 % are achievable at the same load and HN{sub 3 } <b>slip</b> <b>limit.</b> At loads of 43 to 60 MWe, NOx removals with the lances range from 37 [...] 52 %. At loads greater than 60 MWe, the wall-injection location is more efficient, and at loads of 70 to 100 MWe, NOx removals range from 37 [...] 41 %. The coal mill-in-service pattern was found to have a large effect on both NOx removal and NH{sub 3 } slip for injection at the new lance location. At 60 MWe, the NOx removal at the 10 ppm NH{sub 3 } <b>slip</b> <b>limit</b> ranges from 28 [...] 52 % depending on the mill-in-service pattern. Biasing the coal mills to provide uniform combustion conditions ahead of the injection location was found to be the best option for improving SNCR system performance under these conditions...|$|E
40|$|The Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) {{model has}} been shown to exhibit many {{properties}} of human walking, and therefore has been the starting point for studies on robust, energy-efficient walking for robots. In this paper, the problem of gait variation during walking on the SLIP model is addressed by controlling the leg stiffness and the angle-of-attack in order to switch between gaits and thus regulate walking speeds. We show {{that it is possible to}} uniquely describe <b>SLIP</b> <b>limit</b> cycle gaits in fully normalised form. Using that description, we propose both an instantaneous switching method and an interpolation method with an optimisation step to switch between limit cycle SLIP gaits. Using simulations, we show that it is then possible to transition between them, after which the system converges back to zero-input limit cycle walking...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn SCR system {{offers the}} {{opportunity}} for a car to get its nitrogen oxides inside the exhaust gas decreased. This can be achieved by dosing a reducing agent into the system which selectively reacts with the oxygen of the nitrogen oxides and therefore causes these emissions to be diminished. Depending on the operating point of an engine more or less NOx emissions can be reduced. Adaptation logic has the ability to find the optimum operating point at the NH 3 <b>slip</b> <b>limit.</b> The adaptation logic requires the NOx emissions downstream from the SCR which will be measured by a NOx-Sensor. The goal of the module SCRChk_NOxEffCalc is the monitoring of NOx conversion efficiency of an SCR system. The monitoring function is based on a NOx sensor downstream from the SCR and the known NOx emissions upstream from the SCR...|$|E
40|$|To {{strengthen}} concrete or masonry, {{a modern}} technique uses adherent strips made of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP). A model problem {{for this is}} here considered, represented by an elastic stiffener pulled at one end, in adhesive contact with an elastic half space in generalized plane stress. An analytical solution is developed under the hypothesis `a la Baranblatt that cohesive adhesion forces remain active between the two materials when relative slip occurs (provided this {{is less than a}} critical value), so that the stress singularity predicted by the theory of elasticity in the case of perfect bonding is removed. We find that the bond length beyond which no further increase of strength could be achieved, referred to as the effective bond length, coincides in practice with the ultimate length of the cohesive zone, i. e., its maximal extension prior that the critical <b>slip</b> <b>limit</b> is attained. The debonding process in a pull-out experiment is analyzed in detail. Results are in better agreement with experimental data than those obtainable with traditional models, which neglect as a rule the deformation of the substrat...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSlow slip events (SSEs) in {{subduction}} zones {{have been}} observed {{in the last decade}} with continuous GPS stations. Some of them could be related to the lateral segmentation of subduction interface that seems to be a critical parameter for the propagation of large subduction earthquakes. In 2006, one of the largest SSEs recorded so far was captured by a dozen continuous GPS stations, in the Guerrero area (Mexico) along the Mexican subduction zone. Previous studies based on these data suggested a lateral variation of the updip depth of the SEE at the Guerrero seismic gap, but suffered from a lack of resolution east of the gap. Here, we show the ability of InSAR technique to capture a part of the 2006 SSE cumulative displacement east of the Guerrero gap by a stacking approach. We processed long strip Envisat interferograms corrected for orbital errors and interseismic signal using GPS data. We first use a forward modelling approach to test InSAR sensitivity to the amount of slip, depth and width of the slipping area on the subduction interface. Due to its high spatial resolution, InSAR allows one to comprehensively sample the North-South spatial wavelength of the SSE deformation, complementing the sparse GPS network. InSAR locates the maximum of uplift and subsidence caused by the SSE more precisely than the GPS data, giving better constraints on the updip <b>slip</b> <b>limit</b> of the SSE. We then inverted the InSAR and GPS data separately to understand how each inversion resolves the slip at depth. Finally, we performed a joint inversion of InSAR and GPS data, which constrained the SSE slip and its location on the plate interface over the entire Guerrero area. The joint inversion shows significant lateral variation of the SSE slip distribution along the trench with a shallower updip edge in the Guerrero seismic gap, west of Acapulco, and a deeper slip edge further eas...|$|E

40|$|A {{mechatronic}} {{system is}} one in which mechanical, electrical and intelligent computer control are integrated. Two mechatronic systems were used in this thesis. One was a four axis industrial robot and the other a grinding machine. Friction exist in almost mechanisms with moving parts and depending on the arrangement of the mechanical components may have a significant influence on the mechatronic system 2 ̆ 7 s overall performance. Both the mechatronic systems used in this thesis have large friction components. An understanding of friction and subsequent application of this understanding has been used in force estimation and control schemes and to develop control schemes that lead to improved low speed position tracking. At low velocities friction has highly non-linear characteristics. In many instances the friction at rest (the static friction) is higher than the friction when the mechanism moving at low velocities. This in many mechanical systems leads to a phenomena referred to as 2 ̆ 2 stick slip 2 ̆ 2. Stick slip is a periodic cycle of alternating motion and which limits the velocity and position accuracy of many machines. An impulsive control scheme for low velocity position tracking which reduces the stick <b>slip</b> <b>limit</b> cycle was developed in this thesis. A force control scheme in which the applied force is estimated from servo motor information was also developed. The torque applied by the motor is made up of the torque accelerating the mechanical components, the torque required to overcome friction and the torque required to overcome an external force. For many mechanisms the largest force that the motor has to overcome is the friction component. Therefore accurate friction models of the mechanical system were used to extract the required information about the external force from the motor torque signals. The friction models used here include viscous, coulomb and position dependent friction components. The force estimation and control techniques developed were applied to the grinding process. A series of experiments were conducted in which grinding forces were calculated from servo motor information and a control scheme to control grinding forces without using force sensors was implemented...|$|E
