5|$|In 1641, Massachusetts {{expanded}} inland significantly, {{acquiring the}} Connecticut River Valley settlement of Springfield, which had recently disputed with, and defected {{from its original}} administrators, the Connecticut Colony. This established Massachusetts's <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> in the west, though surveying problems resulted in disputed territory until 1803–04.|$|E

5|$|Kansas Turnpike mileposts are {{continuous}} {{along the}} entire length of the turnpike. Mile markers begin at the point where I-35 enters Kansas at the <b>southern</b> <b>border.</b> These numbers are continued along the other three Interstates that make up the turnpike, rather than numbering each Interstate individually, leading to discontinuous numbering on I-70—the exit numbers on tolled I-70 are much lower than those on free I-70.|$|E

5|$|Major {{sporting}} {{and entertainment}} venues {{are concentrated in}} Kingston upon Hull, while the seaside and market towns support semi-professional and amateur sports clubs and provide seasonal entertainment for visitors. Bishop Burton {{is the site of}} an agricultural college, and Hull provides the region's only university. On the <b>southern</b> <b>border,</b> close to Hull, the Humber Bridge spans the Humber Estuary to enable the A15 to link Hessle with Barton-upon-Humber in North Lincolnshire.|$|E
5|$|The Green is not {{perfectly}} rectangular, as its <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> along Wheelock Street runs {{slightly to}} the northeast rather than due east-west. This irregularity {{is due to the}} Town of Hanover's 1873 seizure of part of the southeast corner of the Green, which it used to straighten Wheelock Street. The Green had previously extended 30 feet (nine meters) farther south on that corner.|$|E
5|$|The Red Turban Rebellion saw the {{application}} of early, arrow-firing cannon to both siege and naval warfare in the Southern area of conflict. Following the ascendancy of the Ming Dynasty, cannon were restricted at first to operations pacifying the <b>southern</b> <b>border,</b> including a resounding victory over a band of war-elephants in the 1380s. Cannon {{made their way to}} the northern border by 1414, where their noise had great effect on the Oirats, in addition to reportedly killing several hundred Mongols.|$|E

5|$|The United States {{insisted that}} its {{purchase}} also included most of West Florida {{and all of}} Texas. Thomas Jefferson claimed that Louisiana stretched west to the Rocky Mountains and included the entire watershed of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers and their tributaries, and that the <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> was the Rio Grande. Spain maintained that Louisiana extended {{only as far as}} Natchitoches, and that it did not include the Illinois Territory.|$|E
5|$|The mainly flat {{landscape}} of Weston {{is dominated by}} Worlebury Hill, 109 metres (357ft), which borders the entire northern edge of the town, and Bleadon Hill, 176 metres (577ft) which together with the River Axe, and Brean Down at Uphill form its <b>southern</b> <b>border.</b> In {{the centre of the}} town is Ellenborough Park a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to the range of plant species found there.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{decided to}} transfer Sitting Bull {{and his band}} to Fort Randall, to be held as prisoners of war. Loaded onto a steamboat, the band of 172 people was sent down the Missouri River to Fort Randall (near present-day Pickstown, South Dakota) on the <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> of the state. There they spent the next 20 months. They were allowed to return north to the Standing Rock Agency in May 1883.|$|E

5|$|Although several German states {{initially}} {{sided with}} Austria, they {{stayed on the}} defensive and failed to take effective initiatives against Prussian troops. The Austrian army therefore faced the technologically superior Prussian army with support only from Saxony. France promised aid, but it came late and was insufficient. Complicating the situation for Austria, the Italian mobilization on Austria's <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> required a diversion of forces away from battle with Prussia to fight the Third Italian War of Independence on a second front in Venetia and on the Adriatic sea. The day-long Battle of Königgrätz, {{near the village of}} Sadová, gave Prussia an uncontested and decisive victory.|$|E
5|$|I-94 {{traverses}} Detroit in an east–west direction well inland of, {{and parallel}} to, the Detroit River. The freeway intersects I-96 (Jeffries Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway) on the West Side, passing the main campus of Wayne State University {{before entering the}} East Side at M-1 (Woodward Avenue). Immediately east of the interchange with I-75 (Chrysler Freeway), I-94 forms the <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> of the Milwaukee Junction district. The Edsel Ford Freeway continues through residential neighborhoods of Detroit's East Side. The Interstate turns more northerly, mimicking the shoreline of Lake St. Clair, and exits Detroit for Harper Woods. Just north of the interchange for M-102 (Vernier Road), the freeway crosses 8Mile Road and enters Macomb County.|$|E
5|$|On 30 December 1777, Maximilian Joseph, {{the last}} of the junior line of Wittelsbach, died of smallpox, leaving no children. Charles IV Theodore, a scion of a senior branch of the House of Wittelsbach, held the closest claim of kinship, but he also had no {{legitimate}} children to succeed him. His cousin, Charles II August, Duke of Zweibrücken, therefore had a legitimate legal claim as Charles Theodore's heir presumptive. Across Bavaria's <b>southern</b> <b>border,</b> Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II coveted the Bavarian territory and had married Maximilian Joseph's sister Maria Josepha in 1765 to strengthen any claim he could extend. His agreement with the heir, Charles Theodore, to partition the territory neglected any claims of the heir presumptive, Charles August.|$|E

5|$|Red Dead Redemption spans two fictitious United States {{counties}} and a fictitious Mexican state: New Austin, West Elizabeth, and Nuevo Paraiso. New Austin and West Elizabeth are adjacent {{to each other}} and share a <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> with Mexico. Nuevo Paraiso is a Mexican state, separated from U.S. territory by the San Luis river. The game takes place primarily in the year 1911, featuring the final decade of the American Frontier and the cowboy and outlaw archetypes that shaped it. The landscape of the Wild West is beginning to fade and modern technologies like automobiles, machine guns, and oil drilling projects are beginning to appear.|$|E
5|$|Somerset is {{predominantly}} a rural and agricultural county. The main upland areas are the Mendip Hills {{in the east}} and the Quantock Hills further west, the Blackdown Hills form the county's <b>southern</b> <b>border,</b> and Exmoor is on the western fringes. Between the Mendips and the Quantocks is the large area of flat, low-lying ground known as the Somerset Levels. The county's main rivers are the River Axe in the northeast, and the Rivers Brue and Parrett which flow northwestward through the levels into the Bristol Channel.|$|E
5|$|The first {{boundary}} {{which would}} {{become part of}} the monument was set as part of the Compromise of 1850, which created the New Mexico Territory and Utah Territory. The border between the two territories was congressionally defined as the 37th parallel north by the 31st United States Congress. In 1861, the 36th United States Congress transferred land previously allocated to the Utah Territory, to the newly created Colorado Territory. The Colorado Territory's <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> would remain as the 37th parallel north, but a new border—between the Colorado and Utah Territories—was declared to be the 32nd meridian west from Washington. This line was derived from the reference used at the time, the Washington meridian.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} the finless sleeper ray extends from the eastern Andaman Sea, near <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> between Thailand and Myanmar, through the Strait of Malacca to Singapore, and northward to Vietnam. Its exact {{distribution}} off Thailand is uncertain. There is a single record of this species from Sarawak in Borneo. This bottom-dwelling species inhabits fine sediment habitat over the continental shelf in both inshore and offshore waters. In the 19th century, it was reportedly abundant year-round in the Straits of Malacca. It is locally common in some areas.|$|E
5|$|An attack {{started on}} 6 December, spearheaded by Soviet T-54 and T-55 tanks and {{reportedly}} coordinated by advisors from the Soviet Union and East Germany, brought {{the fall of}} the capital on 16 December. The Libyan force, numbering between 7,000 and 9,000 men of regular units and the paramilitary Pan-African Islamic Legion, 60 tanks, and other armored vehicles, had been ferried across 1,100 kilometers of desert from Libya's <b>southern</b> <b>border,</b> partly by airlift and tank transporters and partly under its own power. The border itself was 1,000 to 1,100 kilometers from Libya's main bases on the Mediterranean coast. Wright states that the Libyan intervention demonstrated an impressive logistical ability, and provided Gaddafi with his first military victory and a substantial political achievement.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{problems}} they encountered because of the fencing, the Byzantines ultimately managed to ferry the Magyar forces led by Árpád's son Liüntika across the Danube, possibly near modern Galaţi, and assisted them in pillaging the nearby Bulgarian lands. Once notified of the surprise invasion, Simeon headed north to stop the Magyars, leaving some of his troops at the <b>southern</b> <b>border</b> to prevent a possible attack by Phokas. Simeon's two encounters with the enemy in Northern Dobruja resulted in Magyar victories, forcing him to retreat to Drǎstǎr. After pillaging much of Bulgaria and reaching Preslav, the Magyars returned to their lands,* Delev, Bǎlgarskata dǎržava pri car Simeon. * Canev, Bǎlgarski hroniki, p. 199. but not before Simeon had concluded an armistice with Byzantium towards the summer of 895. A complete peace was delayed, as Leo VI required {{the release of the}} Byzantine captives from the Trade War.|$|E
