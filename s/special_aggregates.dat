50|$|P. vortex is {{a social}} microorganism: when grown on under growth {{conditions}} that mimic natural environments such as hard surfaces it forms colonies of 109-1012 cells with remarkably complex and dynamic architectures (Figure 1). Being {{part of a large}} cooperative, the bacteria can better compete for food resources and be protected against antibacterial assaults. Under laboratory growth conditions, similar to other social bacteria, P. vortex colonies behave much like a multi-cellular organism, with cell differentiation and task distribution. P. vortex is marked by its ability to generate <b>special</b> <b>aggregates</b> of dense bacteria that are pushed forward by repulsive chemotactic signals sent from the cells at the back. These rotating aggregates termed vortices (Figure 2), pave the way for the colony to expand. The vortices serve as building blocks of colonies with special modular organization (Figure 1). Accomplishing such intricate cooperative ventures requires sophisticated cell-cell communication, including semantic and pragmatic aspects of linguistics. Communicating with each other using a variety of chemical signals, bacteria exchange information regarding population size, a myriad of individual environmental measurements at different locations, their internal states and their phenotypic and epigenetic adjustments. The bacteria collectively sense the environment and execute distributed information processing to glean and assess relevant information. The information is then used by the bacteria for reshaping the colony while redistributing tasks and cell epigenetic differentiations, for collective decision-making and for turning on and off defense and offense mechanisms needed to thrive in competitive environments, faculties that can be perceived as social intelligence of bacteria.|$|E

The tests were performed on two kinds of aggregate: (1) high-density aggregate to absorb the gamma radiation (barite, magnetite, and hematite) and (2) mineral with high bound water content to attenuate the neutron flux (serpentinite). The optical microscopy in transparent light on thin sections, XRD and XRF method, was used to assess the mineral composition of aggregates. ASTM C 1260 test method for potential alkali reactivity of aggregates was applied also to investigate the effect of different content and crystal size of silica on the expansion due to ASR. The tests revealed that all tested aggregates, such as barite, magnetite, hematite, and serpentinite, were characterized by low solubility at high pH. The XRD and XRF results have shown presence of silica in all tested aggregates, but the microscopic observations enhanced size and composition of SiO 2 crystals. The aggregates were not deleterious themselves, but the different content and size of SiO 2 crystals in the aggregate influenced their potential for alkali–silica reaction. The quartz in heavy kinds of rocks and in the serpentinite used for radiation shielding was just as much potentially susceptible to deleterious ASR as quartz in common rocks used in concrete technology. In the hematite, silica crystals were classified as microcrystalline, so it should be considered as potentially reactive. The expansion tests confirmed that hematite was highly reactive. Other aggregates after 14 days of testing did not exceed 0. 1 % elongation limit.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{carried out}} on commission by New Industries, Iceland, comprised comparative tests {{with a total of}} 10 new retreaded passenger car tyres classified M+S with the same tread pattern with and without <b>special</b> <b>aggregates</b> mixed into the tread rubber compound. The tests were carried out in the VTI tyre testing facility on smooth and roughened water covered ice at a speed of 30 km/h. Water covered ice can be {{regarded as one of the}} most dangerous road conditions. Both braking tests and steering tests were performed. The braking tests measured maximum braking friction corresponding to ideal ABS braking performance and friction with a locked wheel. The steering tests measured maximum lateral friction and friction at a 20 -degree side slip angle (skid angle). The latter value represents conditions in skidding of the whole vehicle or excessive steering angle when entering a curve. The results on water covered smooth ice show that a new non studded winter tyre can get about 30 % improved braking friction and about 40 % improved steering friction by means of mixing the special aggregate composition into the tread rubber compound. Testing this improved tyre on water covered stud roughened ice showed that the friction for normal driving is practically the same as on smooth ice. If the vehicle gets in a 20 degree broadslide, rough ice gave up to 40 per cent improvement compared to smooth ice. Repeated tests however quickly reduced this improvement to 10 per cent. The values obtained on smooth flooded ice with the best tyre aggregate tread compound allows cautious driving while the reference tyre friction is insufficient for keeping a vehicle on the road even for a skilled driver under these very severe conditions...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Reliable {{and timely}} {{information}} on the leading causes of death in populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health policy debates. In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (UIs), separately by age and sex. METHODS: We attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys, hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. We assessed data quality for completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and probable causes of death. We applied six different modelling strategies to estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending {{on the strength of}} the data. For 133 causes and three <b>special</b> <b>aggregates</b> we used the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) approach, which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariates. Model ensembles were developed from these component models. We assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95 % UIs. For 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. For 27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the GBD 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database. For selected causes (African trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis E, and HIV/AIDS), we used natural history models based on information on incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. We separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock regressions. For every cause, we estimated 95 % UIs that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where CODEm was used. We constrained cause-specific fractions within every age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions. FINDINGS: In 2010, there were 52 * 8 million deaths globally. At the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24 * 9 % of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15 * 9 million (34 * 1 %) of 46 * 5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2 * 5 to 1 * 4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3 * 4 to 2 * 8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3 * 1 to 2 * 2 million), measles (from 0 * 63 to 0 * 13 million), and tetanus (from 0 * 27 to 0 * 06 million). Deaths from HIV/AIDS increased from 0 * 30 million in 1990 to 1 * 5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1 * 7 million in 2006. Malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19 * 9 % since 1990 to 1 * 17 million deaths in 2010. Tuberculosis killed 1 * 2 million people in 2010. Deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34 * 5 million) worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38 % more than two decades ago; of these, 1 * 5 million (19 %) were from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12 * 9 million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in five in 1990; 1 * 3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in 1990. The fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5 * 1 million deaths) was marginally higher in 2010 (9 * 6 %) compared with two decades earlier (8 * 8 %). This was driven by a 46 % rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents (1 * 3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of death in 2010. Ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) in 2010, similar to what was estimated for 1990, except for HIV/AIDS and preterm birth complications. YLLs from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45 - 54 % since 1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke YLLs increased by 17 - 28 %. Regional variations in leading causes of death were substantial. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76 % of premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010. Age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose (HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases, death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases, COPD, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. For other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little change was noted. INTERPRETATION: Population growth, increased average age of the world's population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases. Nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of YLLs in sub-Saharan Africa. Overlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and others. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation...|$|E

40|$|On {{high-volume}} roads {{cement concrete}} surfaces may be economically favourable {{in comparison to}} asphalt concrete. When a bypass for motorway E 4 in Uppsala (Sweden) was built, cement concrete was therefore selected as the wearing course. It {{is well known that}} noise characteristics of cement concrete surfaces may be poor unless a suitable texture is created. Earlier, the Swedish Road Administration has used the exposed aggregate technique to create a favourable surface texture on newly laid cement concrete on some motorways in Sweden, with both good and poor results. This time a <b>special</b> <b>aggregate</b> grading of the top layer was selected, attempting to combine the desire to have excellent durability against the wear of studded tyres in winter, and the desire to limit tyre/road noise emission from the motorway. Being a bypass, this motorway at some locations run rather near to suburban areas where noise immission might become a serious issue. Noise measurements were made with the CPX method, using four test tyres. The results on the exposed aggregate cement concrete (EACC) were compared with similar measurements on SMA surfaces with the same maximum aggregate size. As a reference for comparison three SMA 0 / 16 were chosen since this is the surface type that would normally be used on a motorway of this kind. The results indicated approx. 2 - 3 dB(A) lower tyre/road noise emission on the EACC than on the SMA 0 / 16 which was better than expected. In the paper the probable causes of the relatively low noise emission are analyzed. The positive results suggest that with a suitable proportioning of the aggregate in the surface layer and high quality exposure technique, the EACC may be used as a standard technique for texturing of cement concrete...|$|R
