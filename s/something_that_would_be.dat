5|$|In 1990, {{the founders}} of Codemasters, David and Richard Darling, were at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and were {{impressed}} with {{the popularity of the}} Nintendo Entertainment System in the USA. They wanted to develop games for the system, but did not have a licence from Nintendo. In October 1989, programmer Andrew Graham developed a prototype, California Buggy Boys, which was showcased with multiple consoles networked. The prototype featured buggies similar to those in Power Drift, and the intention was to develop <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> popular in the United States. Codemasters then obtained a licensing deal with Galoob, who wanted them to develop a game based on their Micro Machines toys. California Buggy Boys was used as a base, and Galoob sent toys to Codemasters, who wanted a good selection for the game.|$|E

25|$|The laws on {{quarantine}} {{will also}} need to be clarified as the regulations for the Apollo program were rescinded. In the Apollo era, NASA delayed announcement of its quarantine regulations until the day Apollo was launched, so bypassing the requirement for public debate - <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unlikely to be tolerated today.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the {{original}} Imperial institution, the modern Order {{does not have}} special robes nor strict rules regulating its wearing. The collar, the sash and {{the star of the}} Imperial Order were only worn with uniform or full evening dress; the insignia are nowadays worn on lounge suit and at least one recipient was seen wearing the order dressed in lounge suit without a tie, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> unheard of during the Imperial era.|$|E
25|$|Kristi N. Scott and M. Heather Dragoo {{note that}} another {{recurring}} {{theme in the}} “image-obsessed society,” is beauty, and its recurring relationship with individuality. Gough agreed, commenting that “when everyone is equal, beauty loses its meaning”. Beauty went {{hand in hand with}} identity: Uglies were taught to think of their bodies and faces as “temporary”, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> replaced later with cosmetic surgery. A strong line is drawn to connect features with personality, and one critic stated that the characters develop “ugly” and “pretty” personalities with each stage of their operations.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{graduating from}} the university, Sakuraba had {{initially}} thought to remain with Chuo University as a coach. However, {{at the last minute}} he decided to pursue a career as a professional wrestler. According to Sakuraba, the impetus for this stemmed from a childhood dream of one day emulating Satoru Sayama, a professional wrestler who portrayed in real life the famous Japanese cartoon hero Tiger Mask. He also stated in an interview with Scramble TV that as an amateur wrestler, he weighed 68 kilograms (about 150 pounds.) He was encouraged by his peers to gain weight as {{it would be difficult to}} compete as a smaller fighter in 'puroresu', and after working to gain the weight needed to compete, he never wanted to lose it anymore, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> reflected in his MMA career.|$|E

25|$|In 1878, Edison {{began working}} on a system of {{electrical}} illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting. He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> needed for indoor use. Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta's demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer, William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich Göbel. Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and high electric current drawn, making them difficult to apply {{on a large scale}} commercially. Edison realized that to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size and using the necessary thickness of copper wire, he would have to develop a lamp that used a low amount of current. This lamp must have high resistance and use relatively low voltage (around 110 volts).|$|E
25|$|In {{computational}} complexity theory, computer algorithms of exponential complexity {{require an}} exponentially increasing amount of resources (e.g. time, computer memory) {{for only a}} constant increase in problem size. So for an algorithm of time complexity 2x, if a problem of size x=10 requires 10 seconds to complete, and a problem of size x=11 requires 20 seconds, then a problem of size x=12 will require 40 seconds. This kind of algorithm typically becomes unusable at very small problem sizes, often between 30 and 100 items (most computer algorithms {{need to be able}} to solve much larger problems, up to tens of thousands or even millions of items in reasonable times, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> physically impossible with an exponential algorithm). Also, the effects of Moore's Law do not help the situation much because doubling processor speed merely allows you to increase the problem size by a constant. E.g. if a slow processor can solve problems of size x in time t, then a processor twice as fast could only solve problems of size x+constant in the same time t. So exponentially complex algorithms are most often impractical, and the search for more efficient algorithms is one of the central goals of computer science today.|$|E
500|$|... "Signs and Wonders" [...] {{was written}} by The X-Files staff writer Jeffrey Bell. Bell had long desired to write a [...] "down-and-dirty" [...] horror story for the series.

500|$|The {{first song}} to be {{attempted}} was [...] "Killer", {{which came out}} of a rehearsal that attempted to join fragments of songs together in a deliberate attempt to create <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> commercially successful. The track was a composite of a basic song structure written by group leader Peter Hammill in 1968, an old song written by founding member Judge Smith called [...] "A Cloud as Big as a Man's Hand", and a rock riff composed by organist Hugh Banton that he later said was influenced by The Move's [...] "Brontosaurus". The lyrics referred to a shark in the ocean, who becomes lonely through killing everything. [...] "Killer" [...] quickly became a live favourite with fans, and the group's signature track.|$|E
500|$|Carl Sagan {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} Contact in 1979. The same year, Lynda Obst, one of Sagan's closest friends, was hired by film producer Peter Guber to be a studio executive for his production company, Casablanca FilmWorks. She pitched Guber the idea for Contact, who commissioned a development deal. Sagan and Ann Druyan (who later became his wife) wrote a 100+ page film treatment, finishing in November 1980. Druyan explained, [...] "Carl's and my dream was to write <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a fictional representation of what contact would actually be like, that would convey something of the true grandeur of the universe." [...] They added the science and religion analogies as a metaphor of philosophical and intellectual interest in searching for the truth of both humanity and alien contact.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{recording}} sessions, the band worked on what Bono estimated to be 50 songs; the Edge said they had about 25 songs to choose from, five of which were still very much in a rough state. Bono said that the songwriting process was humbling, as some songs, [...] "you could get them halfway up the hill, three-quarters of the way up the hill. A lot of times, we just couldn't get them {{up to the top of}} the hill." [...] Speaking about the record's long gestation period, Bono said, [...] "Rumour has it we haven't made a U2 album in the last five years. We have. We've made several. We just didn't release them because we were waiting for <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> as good as the best we've ever done." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 1956, Childe {{was awarded}} the Gold Medal of the Society of Antiquaries for his {{services}} to archaeology. He was invited to lecture in the U.S. on multiple occasions, by Robert Braidwood, William Duncan Strong, and Leslie White, but was barred from entering the country due to his socialist beliefs. Whilst working at the Institute, Childe continued writing and publishing books dealing with archaeology and prehistory. History (1947) continued his belief that prehistory and literate history must be viewed together, and adopted a Marxist view of history, whilst Prehistoric Migrations (1950) displayed his views on moderate diffusionism. In 1946 he had also published a paper in the Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, titled [...] "Archaeology and Anthropology" [...] which argued that the two disciplines must be used in tandem, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> widely accepted in the decades following his death.|$|E
500|$|... 'Artpop' {{is really}} an inferno and it's the only song on the record that I didn't really wanna go {{anywhere}} or explode or orgasm. Because then {{it would just be}} like composing <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> just like every other sort of orgasm that I've ever had. And because its really the center of the record, I really wanted there to be a more infinite tone, to this concept of Art+Pop, that we can put art in the front and not have the corporate world to control in art anymore. How can we the artist back our ideas and for our visions {{to be the most important}} thing. The thing that's driving culture, driving these corporations. I didn't wanted [...] to grow too much, I wanted it to kind of hypnotize people and become like a mantra.|$|E
500|$|Gorillaz are a British virtual band {{created in}} 1998 by Damon Albarn of rock band Blur, and Jamie Hewlett, co-creator {{of the comic}} book Tank Girl. While {{watching}} MTV, Hewlett {{came up with the}} idea to create the band, and later commented, [...] "if you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell – there's nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a cartoon band, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a comment on that." [...] Gorillaz is a virtual band consisting of four cartoon characters: 2D, Murdoc, Noodle and Russel. They are used in promotional material such as album covers, posters, and in concerts, during which holographic versions of the characters are used. The band's music is a collaboration between various musicians; Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor. Gorillaz have released five studio albums, all on the Parlophone and Virgin record labels: Gorillaz (2001), Demon Days (2005), Plastic Beach (2010), The Fall (digital in 2010, physical in 2011), Humanz (2017).|$|E

Series creators Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely revealed they [...] "had a really nice story about who Peggy is and where she came from" [...] that {{did not make it}} into the first season, but they hoped could be explored in a second, while Fazekas and Butters also revealed {{that there had been a}} story about Carter having [...] "a night out with the girls" [...] to explore her personal life, as well as more material for the character Angie, that they felt would both be easier to tell in a second season.|$|E
500|$|In {{the time}} after Morning Phases release and general {{critical}} success, Beck {{mentioned that he}} had been working on another album at around the same time, but that the new album would be more of a pop record. Shortly after Morning Phases Grammy wins, on June 15, 2015, Beck released the first single titled [...] "Dreams" [...] off this upcoming thirteenth studio album. [...] "I was really trying to make <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> good to play live," [...] he said shortly after its release. However, no further word was heard from Beck pertaining to the release of the album. On June 2, 2016, almost a year after the initial release of [...] "Dreams," [...] Beck released a new single titled [...] "Wow", along with a lyric video of the song and an announcement that his still untitled album would be released on October 21, 2016. In September 2016, the album was delayed with no new release date announced and, on September 24, Beck said he didn't know [...] "when it’s coming out. It’s probably in a few months." [...] Once again, however, no further singles were released and no new release date was scheduled for the album.|$|E
500|$|Ray Muzyka, {{co-founder of}} BioWare, {{said that the}} team wanted to try <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> new but {{familiar}} to most players. They hoped that Origins would redefine the genre to become The Lord of the Rings of video game franchises. Greg Zeschuk, another co-founder of BioWare, described the fantasy of Dragon Age as in between the high fantasy of J. R. R. Tolkien's works and the low fantasy of works by George R.R. Martin. The goal was a [...] "dark heroic fantasy" [...] that would suit the taste of any fan of the genre. Thus, while the game has the typical races of human, elf, and dwarf, they are slightly altered from the usual nature of the three races, and a new lizard-like race called the Qunari was introduced. Some of the alterations they made included flipping how certain races, like elves, are treated in other fictional worlds. While elves are often described as a race of high prestige in fiction, Dragon Age: Origins presents them as slaves of humans, labelled as second class citizens who resent the human race. This extended to the gameplay, where the player can choose to discriminate against other races, and can experience discrimination from others based on their choices.|$|E
50|$|In {{the initial}} {{announcement}} of his discovery, Hoag proposed {{the hypothesis that}} the visible ring was a product of gravitational lensing.
