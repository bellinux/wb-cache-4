As the camera pans away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada <b>singing</b> <b>to</b> the camera in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the hover cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, {{and stares at the}} moon, while close-up of the clone's faces are seen <b>singing</b> <b>to</b> the track.|$|E

Timberlake then returns performing choreography again with his dancers. Following the second chorus, Timberlake is dancing with a female (Staci Flood), who lip syncs Vanessa Marquez's section.

The video ends with the final Timberlake duplicate pointing and running towards the opposite direction.|$|E
50|$|It {{would appear}} that most Ancient Greek poetry, {{including}} the poems of Homer, was composed <b>to</b> be <b>sung</b> <b>to</b> music, and it is generally assumed {{by those who have}} reconstructed the surviving fragments of Greek music, such as the Seikilos epitaph, that a short syllable was <b>sung</b> <b>to</b> a short note, while the long syllables were <b>sung</b> <b>to</b> longer notes, or to a group of two or three short notes.|$|R

5|$|Dyer {{was born}} in 1888 in Cardiff, Wales to a Welsh mother and Irish father. Dyer's mother came from a musical {{background}} {{and was a member}} of the Royal Welsh Glee, while his father was a bare knuckle boxer. Dyer showed promise as a baritone singer and was trained by Clara Novello Davies, mother of Ivor Novello. He was also an impressive sportsman, as a swimmer and, like his father, a boxer; but his family's poverty decreed that he took up boxing over his <b>singing</b> <b>to</b> provide an income. Dyer fought in the travelling show booths for quick money, but when this was discovered by the amateur boxing association, it led to him being stripped of his amateur status, which in turn saw his hopes of competing at the 1908 Summer Olympics in boxing and in swimming dashed.|$|E
