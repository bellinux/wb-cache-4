5|$|Several {{journalists and}} conservationists have {{challenged}} {{the logic of}} the strategy, arguing that destroying the ivory makes it scarcer, which should drive up black market prices and lead to an increase in poaching, rather than a decrease. Karl Mathiesen disputes this claim from a basic economics perspective, pointing out that it is the seizure of the ivory, not destroying it, which takes it off the market and affects its <b>scarcity,</b> so the price should not be significantly affected based on whether that seized ivory is kept stockpiled in a warehouse or destroyed. Although destroying seized ivory should not affect a perfectly rational market, Daniel Stiles suggests that what these events effectively communicate to poachers and illegal traders is the perception of <b>scarcity,</b> if not actual <b>scarcity,</b> which he argues could also lead to an increase in poaching.|$|E

40|$|During World War II the United States rapidly {{transformed}} {{its economy}} {{to cope with}} a wide range of <b>scarcities,</b> such as shortfalls in the amounts of ocean shipping, aluminum, rubber, and other raw materials needed for the war effort. This paper explores the mobilization to see whether it provides lessons about how the economy could be transformed to meet <b>scarcities</b> produced by climate change or other environmental challenges. It concludes that the success of the United States in overcoming <b>scarcities</b> during World War II without a major deterioration in living standards provides a basis for optimism that environmental challenges can be met, but that the unique political consensus that prevailed during the war limits the practical usefulness of the wartime model...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present some rather {{detailed}} statistical ("grass-root") material bearing on the question of rural inequality, in the hope that this may help to bring discussion by economists out into the open. I am seeking to demonstrate that there are circumstances in which "inequality" may be a more realistic assumption than "uniform poverty," in which case it is the economic relationship between the different sections of the rural population which requires examination, together with the different <b>scarcities</b> (or groups of <b>scarcities)</b> from which these various sections suffer...|$|R
40|$|Research reportEnsuring food {{security}} [...] especially in Africa [...] depends on breaking cycles of hunger and conflict. Whether one believes that (a) environmental <b>scarcities</b> (including food insecurity) can cause conflict, or (b) that conflict is primarily caused by political factors, it is indisputable {{that access to}} food is always disrupted by conflict. Much {{has been written about}} the linkages between environmental <b>scarcities,</b> hunger, and conflict. This article (a) highlights certain gaps in the information about the steps that lead from hunger to conflict, and then (b) suggests policies and actions to break these connections.

5|$|Civil War tokens are token coins {{that were}} privately minted and {{distributed}} in the United States between 1861 and 1864. They were used mainly in the Northeast and Midwest.

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that human {{resources}} are a pillar of any research and innovation policy, the Medium Term Plan 2011–2015 did not discuss any explicit policy for promoting postgraduate studies {{in science and engineering}}. The <b>scarcity</b> of new PhDs in science and engineering fields from the University of Zimbabwe in 2013 was symptomatic of this omission.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>scarcity</b> of water, the Namib Desert Horse {{sometimes}} {{goes without}} water {{for as long}} as thirty hours in summer and has been known to go close to 72 hours without water during the winter, significantly longer than most horses, even other feral herds. A 1991 study suggested that in 75 years of genetic isolation and water <b>scarcity</b> the population had developed physiological mechanisms which improved their ability to conserve water. In 1993, a second study showed that the physiological water-conservation ability did not differ between Namib Desert Horses and other populations when dehydrated for periods of up to 60 hours, but suggested that the Namib Desert Horse would show improved conservation ability when dehydration periods were extended to upwards of 72 hours, a common occurrence in their feral state.|$|E

5|$|Following the Dunkirk {{evacuation}} in 1940, Britain faced {{a shortage}} of weapons. In particular, there was a severe <b>scarcity</b> of anti-tank weapons, many of {{which had to be}} left behind in France.

5|$|In {{view of the}} <b>scarcity</b> {{of sources}} {{concerning}} Shepseskare, nothing is known for certain about his relation to his predecessors. He was most likely {{a member of the}} royal family, although the possibility that he was a usurper unrelated to his predecessors cannot be totally excluded.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamia has a {{subtropical}} climate with no dry season. Under the Köppen climate classification, {{it has a}} humid {{subtropical climate}} (Cfa). The main features of the climate are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year; this abundant rainfall makes water <b>scarcity</b> and extended periods of drought uncommon; most of the region has a positive water balance.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s, at the University of Toronto, Homer-Dixon studied of {{the links}} between {{environmental}} stress and violent conflict. Two of his articles in the MIT journal International Security identified underlying mechanisms by which <b>scarcities</b> of natural resources like cropland and fresh water could contribute to insurgency, ethnic clashes, terrorism, and genocide in poor countries.|$|R

50|$|Deficiencies {{in any of}} the enzymes in the {{catabolism}} of phenylalanine and tyrosine, like GSTZ1, has led to {{diseases such}} as alkaptonuria, phenylketonuria, and several forms of tyrosinemia. A lack of GSTZ1, specifically, leads to the amalgamation of maleylacetoacetate and succinylacetone which has been observed to cause oxidative stress. Also, <b>scarcities</b> have been seen to alter the metabolism of certain drugs and xenobiotics in mice.|$|R
5|$|The {{relative}} lack of oxygen in the early ocean resulted in a <b>scarcity</b> in dissolved molybdenum. Most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water, but the molybdate ion MoO42− is soluble and forms when molybdenum-containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water.|$|E
5|$|The <b>scarcity</b> of labour and {{abundance}} of land induced a high marginal product of labour. European immigrants (chiefly Italians, Spaniards, French and Germans), tempted {{by the high}} wages, arrived in droves.

50|$|The {{numbers of}} creameries {{increased}} substantially by 1900, {{and by the}} eve of World War I, the country counted nearly 800 plants. In spite of the <b>scarcities,</b> political unrest and violent incidents, the World War I era had been a prosperous period for farmers. The crisis in the country's agricultural market following the war led to {{a large number of}} creameries to shut down.|$|R
5000|$|As {{explained}} above, for classical economists such as Adam Smith {{the term}} [...] "free market" [...] {{does not necessarily}} refer to a market free from government interference, but rather free from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies, and artificial <b>scarcities.</b> This implies that economic rents, i.e. profits generated {{from a lack of}} perfect competition, must be reduced or eliminated as much as possible through free competition.|$|R
