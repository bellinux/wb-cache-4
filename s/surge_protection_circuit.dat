40|$|With the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors {{predicting}} below- 25 nm feature-size VLSIs, {{powered by}} DC power supplies {{of less than}} 1 V, protection against transients has become mandatory for modern electronic systems. Surge protection circuits are usually designed using non-linear devices such as metal oxide varistors and semiconductor devices and these devices are rated for short-term energy absorption, based on transient waveforms defined by standards such as IEEE C 62. 41. Despite their very low voltage DC ratings, supercapacitors are characterized by large time constants and significant continuous energy absorption ratings. This paper presents details of a patent-pending technique where multi-winding magnetic core with a supercapacitor based energy absorber stage can be combined with the commonly used non-linear devices, for enhanced protection.

This fact, supported by recent research publications and laboratory tests, has assisted the authors to propose a new <b>surge</b> <b>protection</b> <b>circuit</b> topology known as the supercapacitor-assisted surge absorber (SCASA).
