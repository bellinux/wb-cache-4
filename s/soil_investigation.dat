The plasticity index (PI) and liquid limit (LL) values of the soil are another criterion often used to check whether fine-grained soil is suitable for Portland cement stabilization.

50|$|In reforesting {{the areas}} {{destroyed}} by storm and forest fire it was initially thought that pine monocultures should be abandoned.
