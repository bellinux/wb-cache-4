40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper (I) ?, the author {{discussed}} {{the nature of}} pressure pulsations in <b>suction</b> <b>systems</b> of free-piston gas generators, and in particular various forms of pulsation damping devices. A theoretical approach {{was based on a}} simple linear treatment of the system, i. e. (1) regarding all pressure pulsations as small in relation to the mean pressure on which they are superimposed, (2) treating dissipative elements (pipe friction or concentrated restrictions) as having linear pressure drop-velocity relationships about the mean flow condition, and (3) treating all distributed elements as having wave motion in accordance with small wave (2) or acoustic theory (rather than the non-linear finite wave theory (3) (4)). Although the physical conditions in compressor delivery systems are very different from those in gas generator <b>suction</b> <b>systems,</b> a similar theoretical approach, verified by acoustic model tests, has been found both to provide a good insight into the problem, and to give an acceptably accurate quantitative indication of pressure pulsation amplitudes. For this purpose systems have been divided into: (1) lumped impedance systems, (2) distributed impedance systems...|$|R

40|$|Nurses play a {{key role}} in {{providing}} care to mechanically ventilated ICU patients and suctioning their secretions. Endotracheal suctioning is a major nursing procedure. Using closed <b>suctioning</b> <b>systems</b> is preferable to open <b>suctioning</b> <b>systems</b> for several reasons. Enhancing the nurses' motivation for using the closed <b>suctioning</b> <b>system</b> (CSS) can accelerate the patients' recovery. This study uses motivational interviews to enhance ICU nurses' internal motivation for change. The present study was conducted to examine the effect of motivational interviews on the level of motivation and self-efficacy for the use of CSS in ICU nurses at Shohada Tajrish Hospital in Tehran in 2015. the present quasi-experimental pretest posttest intervention study was conducted on a sample population of all the ICU nurses at Shohada Tajrish Hospital in Tehran, selected through census sampling. The subjects were randomly divided into equal groups of cases and control (n= 30). Both groups filled out the General Self-Efficacy Scale and the Work Motivation Scale before beginning the study. The intervention consisted of five 90 -minute group sessions carried out over three weeks. Three months later, both groups completed the scales once again as the posttest. The analysis of the data was carried out in SPSS- 18. Descriptive statistics were then used to describe the data, inferential statistics to test the hypothesis and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the ANVOCA for identifying the relationship between the variables. the mean posttest score of job motivation and self-efficacy increased in the intervention group. The results of the ANCOVA also showed that motivational interviews had a meaningful impact on the examined ICU nurses' motivation for the use of CSS (P< 0. 05). Motivational interviews also had a meaningful impact on the nurses' self-efficacy for the use of CSS (P< 0. 05). Motivational interviews can therefore be regarded as an effective technique for enhancing motivation and self-efficacy in ICU nurses for the use of CSS...|$|R

5000|$|Young bluegills' diet {{consists}} of rotifers and water fleas. The adult diet {{consists of}} aquatic insect larvae (mayflies, caddisflies, dragonflies), {{but can also}} include crayfish, leeches, snails, and other small fish. If food is scarce, bluegill will also feed on aquatic vegetation, and if scarce enough, will even feed on their own eggs or offspring. As bluegill {{spend a great deal}} of time near the surface of water, they can also feed on surface bugs. Most bluegills feed during daylight hours, with a feeding peak being observed in the morning and evening (with the major peak occurring in the evening). [...] Feeding location tends to be a balance between food abundance and predator abundance. Bluegill use gill rakers and bands of small teeth to ingest their food. During summer months, bluegills generally consume 35 percent of their body weight each week. To capture prey, bluegills use a <b>suction</b> <b>system</b> in which they accelerate water into their mouth. Prey comes in with this water. Only a limited amount of water is able to be suctioned, so the fish must get within 1.75 centimeters of the prey.|$|E

5000|$|Around 1971, the Archville-based Scarborough Fire Company stopped {{responding}} to Briarcliff fire alarm calls and resisted taking required training courses. Additionally in 1971, Briarcliff's {{government tried to}} charge Archville $200 per year ($ per year in [...] ) for the four existing hydrants and water supply in the hamlet, which Archville reacted in objection to. Briarcliff Manor contacted the State Controller, who instructed the village that Briarcliff Manor's existing arrangement was not in accordance with any state law; that since the Scarborough station was outside of village boundaries, the Scarborough company could not be affiliated with the village fire department. Archville's fire protection district refused to lease the station and equipment from Briarcliff, and thus the Briarcliff Board of Trustees terminated the Scarborough Fire Company's membership in the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department and severed its protection responsibility over Archville. In September 1972, the Briarcliff Manor Board of Trustees formed the Scarborough Engine Company. The company purchased a Mack pumper in 1974. In 1974, the company moved from the church garage to a new $110,725 brick firehouse on Scarborough Road, by architects Pellaton and Chapman.
