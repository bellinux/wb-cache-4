50|$|When {{designing}} mechanical components, {{a system}} of standardized tolerances called International Tolerance grades are often used. The <b>standard</b> (size) <b>tolerances</b> are divided into two categories: hole and shaft. They are labelled with a letter (capitals for holes and lowercase for shafts) and a number. For example: H7 (hole, tapped hole, or nut) and h7 (shaft or bolt). H7/h6 is a very common <b>standard</b> <b>tolerance</b> which gives a tight fit. The tolerances work {{in such a way}} that for a hole H7 means that the hole should be made slightly larger than the base dimension (in this case for an ISO fit 10+0.015−0, meaning that it may be up to 0.015 mm larger than the base dimension, and 0 mm smaller). The actual amount bigger/smaller depends on the base dimension. For a shaft of the same size h6 would mean 10+0-0.009, which means the shaft may be as small as 0.009 mm smaller than the base dimension and 0 mm larger. This method of <b>standard</b> <b>tolerances</b> is also known as Limits and Fits and can be found in ISO 286-1:2010 (Link to ISO catalog).|$|R
