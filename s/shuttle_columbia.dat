5|$|July 1992: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Darby caused cloudiness in California. These clouds were also enough {{to delay the}} landing of the Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> for a day, and cause it to land in Florida instead of California.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Russian-American {{interaction}} resumed {{with the}} Shuttle–Mir missions (1995–1998). Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, {{this time a}} full-fledged space station. This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as {{two of the biggest}} partners in the largest space station built: the International Space Station (ISS). The strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> disaster.|$|E
5|$|The {{launch of}} the Expedition 1 crew {{occurred}} {{a week before the}} United States presidential election, so it got little attention in the United States. At the time of the mission, the station was expected to be completed in 2006, and be continuously inhabited until at least 2015. Due to several delays, including the fallout from the Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> disaster, the station was completed in late 2011, thanks to STS-134.|$|E
5|$|Due to Hurricane Klaus, Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> launch was delayed.|$|R

50|$|In {{keeping with}} an Orbital Sciences tradition, this Cygnus {{spacecraft}} is named the S.S. Rick Husband after the NASA astronaut who commanded the Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> fatal STS-107 mission in 2003.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to the Apollo 1 accident which killed three astronauts in 1967, Congress directed NASA to form an Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) to advise the NASA Administrator on safety issues and hazards in NASA's aerospace programs. In {{the aftermath of the}} <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> accident, Congress required that the ASAP submit an annual report to the NASA Administrator and to Congress. By 1971, NASA had also established the Space Program Advisory Council and the Research and Technology Advisory Council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support. In 1977, the latter two were combined to form the NASA Advisory Council (NAC).|$|E
5|$|Marburger's {{tenure as}} Director {{was the longest}} {{in the history of}} that post. After the September 11 attacks, he helped to {{establish}} the DHS Directorate for Science and Technology within the new Department of Homeland Security. He has been called a central player opposing new restrictions of international scientific exchanges of people and ideas after the attacks. He later was responsible for reorienting the nation's space policy after the Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> disaster, and played an important part in the nation's re-entry into the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor program. Marburger was also known for his support of the emerging field of science of science policy, which seeks to analyze how science policy decisions affects a nation's ability to produce and benefit from innovation.|$|E

40|$|The {{difference}} between an orbit and a revolution is explained and it is shown why space <b>shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> period of revolution was longer than its orbital period. Parameters of orbits examined include apoapsis, periapsis, apogee, perigee, aphelion, perihelion, orbital plane, and inclination. Orbit velocity and duration, Newton's law of gravitation, and Kepler's three laws of motion are considered. The principles involved in geostationary satellites are also explored...|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} earth-viewing imagery obtained during Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> flight STS- 35, December 2 - 10, 1990, is reviewed with emphasis on observations of the Southern Hemisphere. In particular, attention is given to environmental observations in areas of Madagascar, Brazil, and Persian Gulf; observation of land resources (Namibia, offshore Australia); and observations of ocean islands (Phillipines, Indonesia, and Reunion). Some of the photographs are included...|$|R
25|$|In 2003, {{following}} Space <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> breakup upon re-entry, Leinbach was {{the leader}} of the initial debris recovery team in Texas, and Louisiana. He was named to lead the Columbia Reconstruction Team, whose goal was to determine the cause of the accident based only on the debris collected and reassembled at KSC. Following the investigation, Leinbach suggested loaning the debris to various academic institutions for study, to help develop safer spacecraft for the future.|$|R
