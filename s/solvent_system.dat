25|$|All coal gasification-based {{conversion}} processes require {{removal of}} hydrogen sulfide (H2S; an acid gas) from the syngas {{as part of}} the overall plant configuration. Typical acid gas removal (AGR) processes employed for gasification design are either a chemical <b>solvent</b> <b>system</b> (e.g., amine gas treating systems based on MDEA, for example) or a physical <b>solvent</b> <b>system</b> (e.g., Rectisol or Selexol). Process selection is mostly dependent on the syngas cleanup requirement and costs. Conventional chemical/physical AGR processes using MDEA, Rectisol or Selexol are commercially proven technologies and can be designed for selective removal of CO2 in addition to H2S from a syngas stream. For significant capture of CO2 from a gasification plant (e.g., > 80%) the CO in the syngas must first be converted to CO2 and hydrogen (H2) via a water-gas-shift (WGS) step upstream of the AGR plant.|$|E

2500|$|Likewise, the {{configurations}} of laboratory apparatus involving condensers are many and varied, to cover {{low and high}} boiling solvents, simple and complex separations, etc. Several common process types based on the change of physical state provided by condensers can easily be described, including simple evaporations or [...] "solvent stripping" [...] (the bulk removal of all volatiles to leave behind concentrated solutes present in the original solution being evaporated), reflux operations (where {{the aim is to}} contain all volatiles while providing a constant process temperature established by the boiling point of the <b>solvent</b> <b>system</b> being used), and separation/distillation operations (where high theoretical plates provide for selective delivery of one or more volatile components of a complex [...] "mixture" [...] in a controlled fashion). The direction of vapor and condensate flows in the laboratory condenser chosen for each of these may vary (e.g., being countercurrent in reflux procedures, and concurrent in many simple distillation procedures), as do the optimal flow direction for the cooling fluid, etc. In all processes, condenser selection/design requires that the heat of entering vapor never overwhelm the condenser and cooling mechanism; as well, the thermal gradients and material flows established during the gas-liquid transition are critical aspects, so that as processes increase in scale from laboratory to pilot plant and beyond, the design of condenser systems becomes a precise engineering science.|$|E
