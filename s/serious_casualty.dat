25|$|Operation Fa Ngum (127 April 1972) was a Laotian {{military}} offensive {{aimed at}} capturing {{the villages of}} Ban Ngik and Laongam as bases for incursions onto the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The Central Intelligence Agency backers of Royalist guerrillas planned to {{use a combination of}} air mobility and route march assaults to clear Route 23 through the two towns. Defensive forces to be defeated were the People's Army of Vietnam 9th and 39th Regiments. At various times and in differing combinations, the Royalists would commit two regiments of guerrillas, a makeshift regiment of the Royal Lao Army, three battalions of Neutralists, and a detachment of armored cars. Fighting a two phase battle, the Royalists displaced the two PAVN regiments back towards the Vietnamese border. The Royalists both gained and gave up the open air cemetery of Ban Ngik. The PAVN returned westward toward the Thai border as the Royalists fell back. Enfeebled by mutiny and a <b>serious</b> <b>casualty</b> rate, the Royalists ended Operation Fa Ngum with a weak defensive blocking position at Laongam on Route 23.|$|E
25|$|Temeraires one {{brush with}} the French {{during this period}} came on 13 August 1811. Having {{received}} orders to sail to Menorca, Spear attempted to tack out of Hyères Bay. As {{he tried to do}} so, the wind fell away, leaving Temeraire becalmed and caught in a current which caused her to drift towards land. She came under fire from a shore battery on Pointe des Medes, which wounded several of her crew. The most <b>serious</b> <b>casualty</b> was her master, Robert Duncan, who had one of his legs shot off as he stood talking to Spear. Temeraires boats were quickly manned, and together with boats sent from the squadron, she was towed out of range of the French guns. She then sailed to Menorca and underwent repairs. During this period an epidemic of yellow fever broke out, infecting nearly the entire crew and killing around a hundred crewmen. Spear was one of those badly affected, and the {{commander in chief of the}} Mediterranean Fleet, Sir Edward Pellew, ordered him back to Britain with his ship. Health gradually improved as she sailed through the Atlantic. Spear was to have commanded Temeraires replacement in the Mediterranean, the 100-gun , but his ill health prevented this.|$|E

40|$|Within this research, {{the police}} {{under-reporting}} of non-fatal road accident casualties in eight European countries was examined {{by means of}} a common methodology applied in each country. Eight national studies were carried out using the common methodology, and this allowed to prepare valid estimates of the level of under-reporting of non-fatal road casualties in Europe in a disaggregate form (namely by country, road user type and injury severity). This provided an insight into the variation of road casualty under-reporting in Europe. Moreover, a new common definition for road casualty severity was proposed that makes use of internationally recognised medical standards. This was established by examining two different injury severity standards, the casualty's length of stay in hospital and the casualty's maximum AIS score. The under-reporting coefficients developed within this research were applied to estimate the real number of non-fatal <b>serious</b> road accident <b>casualties,</b> according to the new proposed common definition. For almost all countries, the actual number of <b>serious</b> <b>casualties</b> according to the new proposed definition was found lower than the number of police-recorded <b>serious</b> <b>casualties.</b> With the newly estimated number of <b>serious</b> <b>casualties,</b> the values of the ratio of <b>serious</b> <b>casualties</b> to fatalities are much less widespread across countries. These remaining differences can thus be attributed to real differences in road safety between the Countries, after having controlled for the different under-reporting levels and injury severity definitions.

40|$|This project {{examined}} {{the involvement of}} 21 - 26 year-old Victorian drivers in drink-driving behaviour following concerns of their over-representation in alcohol-related, fatal and <b>serious</b> <b>casualty</b> crashes. It is during this age range that Victorian probationary drivers, subject to a zero BAC, generally progress to a full licence, with a corresponding increase in BAC limit to 0. 05. Therefore, this transition was of particular interest. The study {{examined the}} involvement of fullylicensed, 21 - 26 year-old drivers (termed “novices”) in drink-driving behaviour relative to younger probationary drivers (18 - 20 year olds) and older experienced drivers (31 - 40 year olds), including by gender and metropolitan/rural splits. Two complementary approaches were applied. First, fatal and <b>serious</b> <b>casualty</b> crash data from 1993 - 2000 were examined. Analyses confirmed that novices were, in more recent years, over-represented in alcohol-related fatal crashes {{in comparison to the}} other age/experience groups. Analyses by gender and region showed that males in both the novice and probationary groups were over-represented in <b>serious</b> <b>casualty</b> crashes regardless of region.
