5|$|Four magical {{disciplines}} are acquired, {{including the}} Fire of Ares, the Ice of Poseidon, the Lightning of Zeus, and the <b>Soul</b> <b>of</b> Hades, which, {{depending on the}} magic equipped, imbues the Blades of Chaos with that elemental property.

The Ice of Poseidon also enables Kratos to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as substantial time is spent there. The Rage ability called Rage of the Gods that was featured in previous games is included, but in this game, its meter is filled by landing attacks on enemies and the ability is automatically activated once the meter has reached maximum capacity. It remains activated until Kratos is attacked or stops attacking {{for an extended period}} of time, after which the meter must be refilled. The Rage ability is also affected by the magic equipped, allowing Kratos to use different Rage attacks, such as the lightning-based Rage of Zeus.|$|E
