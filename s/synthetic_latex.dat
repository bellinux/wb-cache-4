5000|$|Latex foam in {{mattresses}} {{is generally}} {{a blend of}} the latex of the Hevea brasiliensis tree and <b>synthetic</b> <b>latex,</b> which is derived from petrochemicals and other substances and fillers. There are, however, natural latex mattresses that leave out polyurethane-based chemicals. Latex foam is produced using either the Talalay or the Dunlop process. Each provides a different feel. Dunlop is generally a firmer foam, Talalay is softer. While the Dunlop process produces a denser foam, the Talalay process produces a lighter one that has more air in it. If you were to weigh each as latex cores, the Dunlop foam would be heavier because it has more latex in it. Talalay is more expensive as its production is more resource intensive. Natural latex foam has a higher latex content than <b>synthetic</b> <b>latex,</b> however, [...] "100% natural latex foam" [...] is misleading.|$|E
50|$|Her {{most recent}} {{contribution}} was {{the launch of}} the female condom. She switched from polyurethane material to <b>synthetic</b> <b>latex,</b> which overall saves manufacturing costs and makes the condom much more affordable. The female condom is an over the counter contraceptive, which has been FDA approved for over 20 years. The female condom gives females an option in choosing the best contraceptive, while remaining sexually active. The female condom contains just as high of a success rate as the male condom. It has between 93% to 95% pregnancy prevention success, which is lower than oral contraceptives, injectables, or the IUD.|$|E
50|$|Latex is {{a stable}} {{dispersion}} (emulsion) of polymer microparticles {{in an aqueous}} medium. It is found in nature, but <b>synthetic</b> <b>latexes</b> {{can be made by}} polymerizing a monomer such as styrene that has been emulsified with surfactants.|$|R
50|$|Emulsions {{are used}} to {{manufacture}} polymer dispersions - polymer production in an emulsion 'phase' {{has a number of}} process advantages, including prevention of coagulation of product. Products produced by such polymerisations may be used as the emulsions - products including primary components for glues and paints. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>latexes</b> (rubbers) are also produced by this process.|$|R
50|$|<b>Synthetic</b> <b>latexes</b> {{are used}} in {{coatings}} (e.g. latex paint) and glues because they solidify by coalescence of the polymer particles as the water evaporates, and therefore can form films without releasing potentially toxic organic solvents in the environment. Other uses include cement additives, and to conceal information on scratchcards. Latex, usually styrene-based, is also used in immunoassays.|$|R
50|$|While the {{advantages}} of latex have made it the most popular condom material, it does have some drawbacks. Latex condoms are damaged when used with oil-based substances as lubricants, such as petroleum jelly, cooking oil, baby oil, mineral oil, skin lotions, suntan lotions, cold creams, butter or margarine. Contact with oil makes latex condoms more likely to break or slip off due to loss of elasticity caused by the oils. Additionally, latex allergy precludes use of latex condoms {{and is one of}} the principal reasons for the use of other materials. In May 2009 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted approval for the production of condoms composed of Vytex, latex that has been treated to remove 90% of the proteins responsible for allergic reactions. An allergen-free condom made of <b>synthetic</b> <b>latex</b> (polyisoprene) is also available.|$|E
5000|$|The Talalay {{process is}} an {{elaborate}} process that yields very controlled densities and product [...] "feel". The formulation uses {{many of the}} same base components as the Dunlop formulation, but without gellation reagents. The result is marketed as a healthier alternative to petroleum-based foams since petroleum-based foams give off volatile organic compounds as they age. In the marketing of products such as beds that include [...] "natural" [...] latex foams created with the Talalay process, these products are sometimes characterised as 'organic' or as completely natural however there are different methods of producing Talalay that alter how natural the formula finishes. One compound called Styrene Butadyne Runner is a form of <b>synthetic</b> <b>latex</b> used by Talalay Global And is mixed with the latex from the hevea tree to form the final Talalay product. Vita Talalay in the Netherlands still produces a Talalay product that is free of Styrene Butadyne and uses the latex from the hevea tree and the entire base.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{technology}} {{of getting a}} boots leather alternative was invented in 1904 by Mikhail Pomortsev who used a mixture of egg yolk, rosin and paraffin wax to impregnate kersey. The new material received several awards in Russia and abroad, but was not used due to leather boots manufacturers' lobby. Though being much needed in the army after the Russian revolution, it remained relatively expensive for Soviet Russia until invention of <b>synthetic</b> <b>latex</b> in early 1930's to replace the impregnating mixture used initially. In 1939, Aleksandr Khomutov, the chief engineer of Kozhimit synthetic leather factory in Moscow, and his fellow engineer Ivan Plotnikov developed the new kirza that was named Kirza SK. Its mass production began during the Winter War of the Soviet Union against Finland. Initially the material proved to be unfit for winter conditions, and its production was halted. However, very soon the technology was improved and the mass production was resumed in the autumn and winter of 1941 during the German invasion of Soviet Union, since {{the large numbers of}} footwear were badly needed for the Red Army.|$|E

50|$|Canvas is {{typically}} stretched across a wooden frame called a stretcher {{and may be}} coated with gesso before {{it is to be}} used; this is to prevent oil paint from coming into direct contact with the canvas fibres, which will eventually cause the canvas to decay. A traditional and flexible chalk gesso is composed of lead carbonate and linseed oil, applied over a rabbit skin glue ground; a variation using titanium white pigment and calcium carbonate is rather brittle and susceptible to cracking. As lead-based paint is poisonous, care has to be taken in using it. Various alternative and more flexible canvas primers are commercially available, the most popular being a <b>synthetic</b> <b>latex</b> paint composed of titanium dioxide and calcium carbonate, bound with a thermo-plastic emulsion. Many artists have painted onto unprimed canvas, such as Jackson Pollock, Kenneth Noland, Francis Bacon, Helen Frankenthaler, Dan Christensen, Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Color Field painters, Lyrical Abstractionists and others. Staining acrylic paint into the fabric of cotton duck canvas was more benign and less damaging to the fabric of the canvas than the use of oil paint.In 1970 artist Helen Frankenthaler commented about her use of staining:When I first started doing the stain paintings, I left large areas of canvas unpainted, I think, because the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as positively as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground was part of the medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had paint next to it. The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. Its saying it in space.|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for anchoring enzymatically degraded cationized starch as electrosteric stabilizers onto synthetic latices, using cerium(IV) to create free-radical grafting {{sites on the}} starch. Direct anchoring of debranched starch onto a poly (methyl methacrylate) seed latex yields a latex stabilized by well-defined oligosaccharides. Using a-amylase to randomly cleave starch to form (1 -> 4) -alpha-glucans, and a comonomer, N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM), whose corresponding polymer exhibits a lower critical solution temperature (LCST), creates a means to synthesize block (or graft) oligomers of oligosaccharide and synthetic polymer, which are water soluble at room temperature. Above 30 degrees C, they become amphiphilic and form self-emulsifying nanoparticles (sometimes termed "frozen micelles") from which a <b>synthetic</b> <b>latex</b> is grown after addition of methyl methacrylate, the collapsed NIPAM-containing entities functioning {{as a type of}} in situ seed. This synthesis of stable <b>synthetic</b> <b>latex</b> particles is shown to have a high grafting efficiency. The starch fragments were characterized by (1) H solution-state NMR before grafting, and (13) C solid-state cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR was used to characterize the starch oligomers actually grafted on the final latex.

40|$|Male latex condoms have a {{long history}} of safety and effectiveness, and their {{performance}} during use is well established. However, far less information is available for female condoms (FCs). There is limited research on FC functionality and in many published studies to date events such as breakage and slippage are based on equivalent definitions for male condoms. However, we now know that failure modes for FCs (aside from breakage) are more complex and have only recently been better understood and described (Beksinska et al. 2007, WHO Technical Review Committee 2007). Clinical trials collecting data on FC functionality need to ensure that the correct terms and definitions are used. Since the approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) of the first FC (FC 1) in 1992, several different types of FCs have become available or are in development to lower cost and/or improve acceptability. FC 2, the second-generation female condom made by the Female Health Company, was approved by the USFDA in early 2009 and will replace FC 1. FC 2 is made from a <b>synthetic</b> <b>latex</b> whereas FC 1 is made from polyurethane, though both products have essentially the same design.

40|$|The {{particle}} size and morphology of a <b>synthetic</b> polymer <b>latex</b> {{were shown to}} influence the film formation behavior. Theoretical models predict that small particles coalesce more easily than large colloids do. The influence of {{particle size}} and morphology of differently structured lattices on the film-formation process was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Sequences of AFM images were acquired over a certain temperature range {{or at room temperature}} as a function of time. From the resulting images the average particle diameter of the latex particles in the surface layer was determined {{as a function of the}} time or temperature. The resulting curves could be compared to observe differences in the film formation kinetics of the different lattices. These AFM studies confirmed that the film formation behavior is influenced by the particle size and particle morphology, but that the core/shell ratio of core-shell particles has no significant influence on the film formation kinetics. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Starch is a {{biopolymer}} {{that is used}} as a co-binder alongside synthetic petroleum based latex binders {{for paper}} coating applications, though it causes production downtimes due to the problems during cooking process, such as gelling; lack of full expansion of starch granules; increase in viscosity during cooling; bacteria growth in cooked starch and difficulties in viscosity control during storage.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Comparisons of {{properties}} {{are made for}} pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) generated via emulsion polymerization using both conventional and reactive emulsifiers. The emulsifiers are ammonium salts of sulfated nonylphenol ethoxylates with similar chemical structures and hydrophilic−lipophilic balances. The polymerizable surfactant possesses a reactive double bond at its phenyl ring allowing for participation in free-radical polymerization reactions. Incorporation of the polymerizable surfactant into the adhesive polymer was confirmed via reverse-phase liquid chromatography. Surfactant distributions in PSA films were characterized using confocal Raman microscopy and contact angle measurements. Increasing conventional surfactant concentrations in emulsion polymerization reactions resulted in proportional increases in concentrations at the surfaces of latex-cast films. No surface enrichment of adhesive films was observed when reactive emulsifiers were employed. Variations in measured depth profiles and contact angles are consistent with observed performance properties, for example, tack, peel strength, and shear times. Increasing concentrations of conventional surfactants decreased adhesive performance, while adhesives generated with polymerizable surfactants showed little or no such decreases in film performance properties. It is concluded that the polymerizable surfactant is bound in the adhesive {{in such a way}} that its migration to film surfaces during drying and formation is inhibited, preventing degradation of adhesive performance. <b>Synthetic</b> polymer <b>latexes</b> produced via emulsion polymerizatio...|$|R
40|$|The two-component redox-initiation system, cumene {{hydroperoxide}} (CHP) and tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA), {{was used to}} polymerize dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) {{in the presence of}} <b>synthetic</b> polyisoprene <b>latexes.</b> The modified latex particles are postulated to possess a 2 ̆ 7 hairy layer 2 ̆ 7 of surface-grafted poly(DMAEMA) chains formed via an abstraction reaction between cumyloxy radicals and the isoprene moieties present in the seed polymer. The modified latexes exhibited enhanced colloidal stability to low pH, and dynamic light scattering showed that the apparent particle size was sensitive to pH. The rate of polymerization was followed by reaction calorimetry. No steady-state polymerization was observed, with a continual {{increase in the number of}} propagating chains at all initiator feed rates investigated. The data for particle size and colloidal stability, together with the calorimetric data, are consistent with radical production at the particle surface, and with abstraction near the interface being a rare event. Further, there is evidence that radical production by the redox couple is relatively slow. While this 2 ̆ 7 topology-controlled 2 ̆ 7 reaction is responsible for the formation of the hairy layer and latex stability, the dominant polymerization process appears to be the formation of ungrafted poly(DMAEMA) in the water phase.

40|$|A novel, soft {{microbial}} {{fuel cell}} (MFC) has been constructed using the finger-piece of a standard laboratory natural rubber latex glove. The natural rubber serves as structural and proton exchange material whilst untreated carbon veil {{is used for the}} anode. A soft, conductive, <b>synthetic</b> <b>latex</b> cathode is developed that coats the outside of the glove. This inexpensive, lightweight reactor can without any external power supply, start up and energise a power management system (PMS), which steps-up the MFC output (0. 06 e 0. 17 V) to practical levels for operating electronic devices (> 3 V). The MFC is able to operate for up to 4 days on just 2 mL of feedstock (synthetic tryptone yeast extract) without any cathode hydration. The MFC responds immediately to changes in fuel-type when the introduction of urine accelerates the cycling times (35 vs. 50 min for charge/discharge) of the MFC and PMS. Following starvation periods of up to 60 h at 0 mV the MFC is able to cold start the PMS simply with the addition of 2 mL fresh feedstock.

40|$|Low-density wood fiber {{insulation}} {{boards are}} traditionally manufactured in a wet process using a closed water circuit (process water). The water of these industrial processes contains natural phenolic extractives, aside from {{small amounts of}} admixtures (e. g., binders and paraffin). The suitability of two fungal laccases and one bacterial laccase was determined by biochemical characterization considering stability and substrate spectra. In a series of laboratory scale experiments, the selected commercial laccase from Myceliophtora thermophila was used to catalyze the surface modification of thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) using process water. The laccase catalyzed the covalent binding of the phenolic compounds of the process water onto the wood fiber surface and led to change of the surface chemistry directly via crosslinking of lignin moieties. Although a complete substitution of the binder was not accomplished by laccase, the combined use of laccase and latex significantly improved the mechanical strength properties of wood fiber boards. The enzymatically-treated TMP showed better interactions with the synthetic binder, as shown by FTIR-analysis. Moreover, the enzyme is extensively stable in the process water and the approach requires no fresh water as well as no cost-intensive mediator.

One attractive possibility consists of targeting the antigen to phagocytic or macropinocytic antigen-presenting cells. In this study, we demonstrate that strong CD 8 + class I-restricted cytotoxic responses are induced upon intraperitoneal immunization of mice with different peptides, characterized as CD 8 + T-cell epitopes, bound to 1 -μm <b>synthetic</b> <b>latex</b> microspheres and injected {{in the absence of}} adjuvant. The cytotoxic response induced against a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) peptide linked to these microspheres was compared to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response obtained upon immunization with the nonreplicative porcine parvovirus-like particles (PPV:VLP) carrying the same peptide (PPV:VLP-LCMV) previously described (C. Sedlik, M. F. Saron, J. Sarraseca, I. Casal, and C. Leclerc, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 : 7503 – 7508, 1997). We show that the induction of specific CTL activity by peptides bound to microspheres requires CD 4 + T-cell help in contrast to the CTL response obtained with the peptide delivered by viral pseudoparticles. Furthermore, PPV:VLP are 100 -fold more efficient than microspheres in generating a strong CTL response characterized by a high frequency of specific T cells of high avidity. Moreover, PPV:VLP-LCMV are able to protect mice against a lethal LCMV challenge whereas microspheres carrying the LCMV epitope fail to confer such protection. This study demonstrates the crucial involvement of the frequency and avidity of CTLs in conferring antiviral protective immunity and highlights the importance of considering these parameters when developing new vaccine strategies...|$|E
40|$|For the {{recycling}} of carpet and artificial turf the latex backing {{is often a}} real stumble block. Many strategies have been developed like freezing the carpet, followed by grinding and subsequent separation of the milled particles. Once it has been separated from its backing materials, PA 6 {{is relatively easy to}} depolymerise. This produces fresh caprolactam {{that can be used to}} manufacture PA 6 with no loss in quality, and is suitable for further recycling [1]. The comparable process for PA 6, 6 is not as easy, but DuPont and Polyamid 2000 have developed and patented a process that depolymerises any mixture of PA 6 and 6, 6 using ammonia. The result is fresh caprolactam and 1, 6 diaminohexane for manufacture of PA 6 and 6, 6 respectively [2]. Obviously a lot of research has been devoted to avoiding latex as a backing like e. g. polyurethane carpet backing systems based on natural oil polyols and polymer polyols [4]. Still carboxylated styrene butadiene is the leading <b>synthetic</b> <b>latex</b> polymer used in EU- 27 for carpet backing, followed by styrene-acrylics and pure acrylics. This contrasts with Eastern Europe, Russia, and Turkey where styrene-acrylics dominate, followed by PVAc and redispersible powders [3]. In addition there has been a lot of research into developing alternative backing systems where the backing can easily be removed. Examples are the use of gecko technology [5] or using click chemistry (reversible Diels Alder reactions) [6]. But the best option for recycling is of course to develop carpets based completely on monomaterials.   Paper for the 14 th Autex World Textile Conference May 26 th- 28 th 2014, Bursa, Turkey...|$|E
40|$|In {{systems and}} {{computational}} biology, much effort {{is devoted to}} functional identification of systems and networks at the molecular-or cellular scale. However, similarly important networks exist at anatomical scales such as the tendon network of human fingers: the complex array of collagen fibers that transmits and distributes muscle forces to finger joints. This network {{is critical to the}} versatility of the human hand, and its function has been debated since at least the 16 (th) century. Here, we experimentally infer the structure (both topology and parameter values) of this network through sparse interrogation with force inputs. A population of models representing this structure co-evolves in simulation with a population of informative future force inputs via the predator-prey estimation-exploration algorithm. Model fitness depends on their ability to explain experimental data, while the fitness of future force inputs depends on causing maximal functional discrepancy among current models. We validate our approach by inferring two known <b>synthetic</b> <b>Latex</b> networks, and one anatomical tendon network harvested from a cadaver's middle finger. We find that functionally similar but structurally diverse models can exist within a narrow range of the training set and cross-validation errors. For the Latex networks, models with low training set error [< 4 %] and resembling the known network have the smallest cross-validation errors [∼ 5 %]. The low training set [< 4 %] and cross validation [< 7. 2 %] errors for models for the cadaveric specimen demonstrate what, to our knowledge, is the first experimental inference of the functional structure of complex anatomical networks. This work expands current bioinformatics inference approaches by demonstrating that sparse, yet informative interrogation of biological specimens holds significant computational advantages in accurate and efficient inference over random testing, or assuming model topology and only inferring parameters values. These findings also hold clues to both our evolutionary history and the development of versatile machines...|$|E
30|$|Isoprene {{represents}} a key building block {{for the production}} of valuable materials such as <b>latex,</b> <b>synthetic</b> rubber or pharmaceutical precursors and serves as basis for advanced biofuel production. To enhance the production of the volatile natural hydrocarbon isoprene, released by plants, animals and bacteria, the Kudzu isoprene synthase (kIspS) gene has been heterologously expressed in Bacillus subtilis DSM 402 and Bacillus licheniformis DSM 13 using the pHT 01 vector. As control, the heterologous expression of KIspS in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) with the pET 28 b vector was used. Isoprene production was analyzed using Gas Chromatography Flame Ionization Detector. The highest isoprene production was observed by recombinant B. subtilis harboring the pHT 01 -kIspS plasmid which produced 1434.3  μg/L (1275  µg/L/OD) isoprene. This is threefold higher than the wild type which produced 388  μg/L (370  μg/L/OD) isoprene, when both incubated at 30  °C for 48  h and induced with 0.1  mM IPTG. Additionally, recombinant B. subtilis produced fivefold higher than the recombinant B. licheniformis, which produced 437.2  μg/L (249  μg/L/OD) isoprene when incubated at 37  °C for 48  h induced with 0.1  mM IPTG. This is the first report of optimized isoprene production in B. licheniformis. However, recombinant B. licheniformis showed less isoprene production. Therefore, recombinant B. subtilis is considered as a versatile host for heterologous production of isoprene.|$|R
40|$|The maximum {{permissible}} concentration (MPC) of chloroprene was set at 2 mg/ma in the USSR in the 1940 's. The existing MPC is 4 mg/mr. The {{threshold of}} systemic effects {{as a result of}} chronic chloroprene exposure is 1. 69 mg/mrn. However, the threshold for embryotoxic and mutagenic effects is 0. 15 mg/mr. In consideration of this information, setting a new MPC for chloroprene at 0. 05 mg/mr is recommended. Chloroprene (2 -chlorobuta- 1, 3 -diene) is usually obtained by a reaction of vinylacetylene with hydrogen chloride. It is used as a monomer for the production of <b>synthetic</b> rubber and <b>latexes.</b> Chloroprene may be classified as a polytropic poison since it causes functional and organic disturbances of the nervous system, the cardiovascular system. the liver and the kidneys. In women working with chloroprene (Nairit) latex, pregnancy has been found to take an unfavorable course (1). The {{maximum permissible concentration}} (MPC) of chloroprene at 2 mg/m 3 was established in the USSR in the 1940 's on the basis of calculations and data in the literature. In connection with the appearance of congenital abnormalities in the children of women employed in the polymerization shop in a chloroprene factory (2) women were taken off chloroprene production (3). Clinical and safety investigations in factories and a whole range of experimental studies were subsequently undertaken to establish a corrected MPC...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this project was to develop an energy efficient, environmentally friendly and low cost process (compared to the current process) for making tackifier dispersions {{that are used to}} make pressure-sensitive adhesives. These adhesives are employed in applications such as self-adhesive postage stamps and disposable diapers and are made by combining the tackifier dispersion with a natural or <b>synthetic</b> rubber <b>latex.</b> The current process for tackifier dispersion manufacture begins by melting a (plastic) resin and adding water to it in order to form a water-in-oil emulsion. This is then converted to an oil-in-water emulsion by phase inversion in the presence of continuous stirring. The resulting emulsion is the tackifier dispersion, but it is not concentrated and the remaining excess water has to be transported and removed. The main barrier that has to be overcome in the development of commercial quality tackifier dispersions is the inability to directly emulsify resin in water due to the very low viscosity of water as compared to the viscosity of the molten resin. In the present research, a number of solutions were proposed to overcome this barrier, and these included use of different mixer types to directly form the emulsion from the molten resin but without going through a phase inversion, the idea of forming a solid resin-in-water suspension having the correct size and size distribution but without melting of the resin, and the development of techniques of making a colloidal powder of the resin that could be dispersed in water just prior to use. Progress was made on each of these approaches, and each was found to be feasible. The most appealing solution, though, is the last one, since it does not require melting of the resin. Also, the powder can be shipped in dry form and then mixed with water in any proportion depending on the needs of the process. This research was conducted at Argonne National Laboratory, and it was determined the new process uses 78 % less energy than the conventional process. Additional benefits of the new process are that it can process resins that cannot presently be processed without using solvents and that it can result in new products made with mixed resins...|$|R
