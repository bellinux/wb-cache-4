5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a {{frictional}} surface {{can result in a}} situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by <b>static</b> <b>friction,</b> generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the <b>static</b> <b>friction</b> force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The <b>static</b> <b>friction</b> increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E
5|$|Friction is {{a surface}} force that opposes {{relative}} motion. The frictional force {{is directly related}} to the normal force that acts to keep two solid objects separated at the point of contact. There are two broad classifications of frictional forces: <b>static</b> <b>friction</b> and kinetic friction.|$|E
5|$|Ski wax {{enhances the}} ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value <b>static</b> <b>friction.</b> Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.|$|E
40|$|Dynamical rupture {{process on}} the fault is {{investigated}} in a quasi-three-dimensional faulting model with non-uniform distributions of <b>static</b> <b>frictions</b> or the fracture strength under a finite shearing pre-stress. The displacement and stress time functions on the fault are obtained by solving numerically the {{equations of motion}} with a finite stress—fracture criterion, using the finite difference method. If <b>static</b> <b>frictions</b> are homogeneous or weakly non-uniform, the rupture propagates nearly elliptically with a velocity close to that of P waves along the direction of pre-stress and with a nearly S wave velocity in the direction perpendicular to it. The rise time of the source function and the final displacements are larger around {{the centre of the}} fault. In the case when the <b>static</b> <b>frictions</b> are heavily non-uniform and depend on the location, the rupture propagation becomes quite irregular with appreciably decreased velocities, indicating remarkable stick-slip phenomena. In some cases, there remain unruptured regions where fault slip does not take place, and high stresses remain concentrated up to the final stage. These regions could be the source of aftershocks at a next stage. The stick—slip faulting and irregular rupture propagation radiate high-frequency seismic waves, and the near-field spectral amplitudes tend to show an inversely linear frequency dependence over high frequencies for heavily non-uniform frictional faults...|$|R

This completed the classic empirical model of <b>friction</b> (<b>static,</b> kinetic, and fluid) commonly used today in engineering. In 1877, Fleeming Jenkin and J. A.

25|$|<b>Static</b> <b>{{friction}}</b> is {{friction between}} {{two or more}} solid objects that are not moving relative to each other. For example, <b>static</b> <b>friction</b> can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of <b>static</b> <b>friction,</b> typically denoted as μs, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. <b>Static</b> <b>friction</b> is considered to arise {{as the result of}} surface roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as asperities are present down to nano-scale dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for {{only a fraction of the}} apparent or nominal contact area. The linearity between applied load and true contact area, arising from asperity deformation, gives rise to the linearity between static frictional force and normal force, found for typical Amonton-Coulomb type friction.|$|E

40|$|Today, {{the use of}} {{brushless}} DC motors (BDCM) in robotic applications is only at {{its beginning}} {{in spite of their}} remarkable features. This is due to the increased complexity of the control with respect to the conventional DC motors, but also to the parasitic torques of the BDCM, i. e. the Cogging, the Ripple and the Hyteresis Drag torques which limit their full potential when accurate control is required. In this paper, we deal with the digital compensation of the parasitic torques. The main novelty presented is the compensaction of the,magnetic hysteresis drag. As the effect of this drag {{is similar to that of}} the <b>static</b> mechanical <b>friction,</b> the proposed compensation algorithm allows greater positioning precision in robotic applications. The importance of this compensation is vital in the field of teleoperators for position error based force reflecting servomanipulators. Electronic offsets compensation and the ways to partially compense the <b>static</b> mechanical <b>friction</b> are also compensate the <b>static</b> mechanical <b>friction</b> are also considered. Besides, we present a procedure for the quick automatic determination of the two independant look-up tables needed to compensate the cogging torque an torque ripple.

25|$|Arthur Morin {{introduced}} the term and demonstrated {{the utility of}} the coefficient of friction. The coefficient of friction is an empirical measurement – it has to be measured experimentally, and cannot be found through calculations. Rougher surfaces tend to have higher effective values. Both static and kinetic coefficients of friction depend on the pair of surfaces in contact; for a given pair of surfaces, the coefficient of <b>static</b> <b>friction</b> is usually larger than that of kinetic friction; in some sets the two coefficients are equal, such as teflon-on-teflon.|$|E
25|$|The {{force of}} {{friction}} is always exerted {{in a direction}} that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for <b>static</b> <b>friction)</b> between the two surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note {{that it is not the}} direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.|$|E
25|$|In the {{reference}} {{frame of the}} interface between two surfaces, <b>static</b> <b>friction</b> does no work, because there is never displacement between the surfaces. In the same reference frame, kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the motion, and does negative work. However, friction can do positive work in certain frames of reference. One can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug, then pulling on the rug quickly. In this case, the box slides backwards relative to the rug, but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary. Thus, the kinetic friction between the box and rug accelerates the box {{in the same direction}} that the box moves, doing positive work.|$|E

25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome <b>static</b> <b>friction</b> under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|E

In practical use, high viscosity lubricant is used in wet brake to prevent oil leakage. At cutting after laser heat treatment, when the higher thrust force was, the higher micro wavy height was obtained.

A prosthetic limb simulator device {{was used to}} study the influence of applied hip torques and <b>static</b> ground <b>friction</b> on the prosthetic foot trajectory. Inverse dynamics were {{used to calculate the}} energy produced by the hip joint. A two-dimensional forward dynamics model was used to investigate the relation between obstacle-foot distance and the necessary hip torques utilized during obstacle avoidance. The study showed that a prosthetic knee flexion strategy was facilitated by the use of ground friction and by larger active hip torques. This strategy required more energy produced by the hip compared to a knee extension strategy. We conclude that when an amputee maintains enough distance between the distal tip of the foot and the obstacle during stance, he or she produces sufficiently high, yet feasible, hip torques and uses <b>static</b> ground <b>friction,</b> the amputee satisfies the conditions for enable stepping over an obstacle using a knee flexion strategy.
