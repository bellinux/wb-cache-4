She had been strangled and sexually assaulted with a vibrator and a large plastic bag had been wrapped around her legs. Because of the condition of her remains, police were not able to identify the body until Harrison's father confirmed that it was his daughter. A Budweiser towel, a bloody car <b>seat</b> <b>box,</b> a wad of Harrison's hair, gloves, a plaid shirt and jeans were all found {{in the vicinity of the}} dump site.

Krista was buried in the Maple Grove Cemetery in Marshallville.|$|E

Hundreds of state employees worked on completing the Kimberly Road Outerbelt Bypass in 1936.|$|R
