40|$|Abstract. Nitrogen (N) {{fertiliser}} is {{an important}} and expensive input to oil palm in Papua New Guinea. Of about 3000 mm/year of rainfall, about 1300 mm is lost as evaporation. This leaves an excess of> 1000 mm/year lost as surface runoff and/or deep drainage, {{and with it the}} potential for N loss. Approximately 11 % of rainfall reached the ground as <b>stem</b> <b>flow.</b> Throughfall was generally lowest near the trunk and highest where canopies overlapped, but random spatial variability was large. The difference between the measured rainfall and <b>stem</b> <b>flow</b> plus throughfall was 6 %, indicating relatively little interception. Surface runoff from the volcanic ash soils was 6 % of rainfall at one site, but only 1. 4 % at the other. Less than 2 % of the applied N was lost in the surface runoff after an ammonium chloride application. Calculations of N leaching losses made using suction cup data and the water balance indicated that significant losses occur, but the estimates were not reliable due to the huge spatial variability in the suction cup and throughfall data. Therefore, another technique is needed to study N leaching in oil palm plantations...|$|E
40|$|Part of a {{rainfall}} {{is captured}} by the crowns {{of the trees and}} other surfaces as interception, which is then evaporated back into the atmosphere. Water moves down through the forest canopy via two mechanisms; stemflow and throughfall processes. Stemflow refers to the total quantity of rain water which reach the ground through tree stems and branches. Throughfall in the other hand, is the tendency of the rainfalls to penetrate the forest canopy directly through the spaces between the leaves or by dripping from the leaves, twigs, and branches. Both components were measured in an interception plot size 100 ¥ 100 m 2 in a secondary tropical forest at Tasik Chini. Thirty tree samples were used and each tree was well-identified based on their species, family, diameter breast height (DBH), canopy size and its density.

40|$|Although water {{conservation}} {{programs in the}} arid Southwest have prompted prudent landscaping practices such as planting low water use trees, there is little data on the actual water use of most species. Few methods or models {{have been developed for}} measuring tree water use. The stem heat balance method is one such method. Predictive models of tree water use have been limited to applications of the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation with varying degrees of success. The purpose of this study was: to validate <b>stem</b> <b>flow</b> gauge accuracy in a greenhouse and a desert environment; to determine the actual water use of two landscape tree species in Tucson, Arizona; to determine water use coefficients for two tree species based on the crop coefficient concept; and to test and develop a predictive model of tree water use based on the Penman-Monteith equation. Water use of oak (Quercus virginiana 'Heritage') and mesquite (Prosopis alba 'Colorado') trees in containers was measured using a precision balance and <b>stem</b> <b>flow</b> gauges. Water use coefficients for each tree species were calculated as the ratio of water use per total leaf area and per projected canopy area to reference evapotranspiration (ETo) using the Penman combination equation. After accounting for tree growth, water use coefficients on a total leaf area basis were calculated to be 0. 48 and 0. 97 for the oaks and mesquites, respectively, and 1. 36 and 1. 56 for the oaks and mesquites, respectively, on a projected canopy area basis. These coefficients indicate that mesquites (so called xeric trees) use more water than oaks (so called mesic trees) under non-limiting conditions. Stomatal resistances (r(s)) were calculated using the PM equation, and ranged from 20 to 200 s cm⁻¹. Calibrations were developed between r(s) and net radiation for both species. Results of the PM model to predict daily tree water use ranged from - 15 to + 150 percent error, depending on the tree, indicating the need for accurate measurements of stomatal resistance in order to use the PM model. Results indicate that a shortened form of the PM equation requiring only vapor pressure deficit and r(s) would be sufficient to predict tree water use...|$|E

40|$|Mediterranean {{evergreen}} oaks have {{to survive}} a long summer drought. Roots may play a relevant role under these conditions. We studied their structure and function in a mature Quercus suber L. tree in central Portugal. The root system was mapped till the lowest water table level (4. 5 m depth). Xylem anatomy was analyzed in a vertical profile belowground. Sap flow was continuously monitored for 1. 5 yrs in the stem and roots of this intensively studied tree (heat field deformation method) and in the stem of four trees (Granier method), in relation to environmental variables and predawn leaf water potential. The sources of water uptake were assessed by stable isotope analyses in summer. Results showed a dimorphic root system with a network of superficial roots linked to sinker roots, and a taproot diverting into tangles of deep fine roots submerged for long periods, with parenchyma aerenchyma. Transpiration was not restricted in summer due to root access to groundwater. The isotopic d 18 O signature of twig xylem water {{was similar to that}} of groundwater in the dry season. Two functional types of superficial roots were identified: shallow connected and deep connected roots. A modeling approach was built considering that each superficial root was linked to a sinker, with part of the root deep connected (between the stem and the sinker) and part shallow connected (between the sinker and topsoil). This conceptual framework simulated tree stem sap flow from root sap flow with a high efficiency (R 2 = 0. 85) in four plot trees. On an annual basis, soil water and groundwater contributions were 69. 5 % and 30. 5 % of <b>stem</b> <b>flow,</b> respectively.
