5|$|After his death, Gaudí's works {{suffered}} {{a period of}} neglect and were largely unpopular among international critics, who regarded them as baroque and excessively imaginative. In his homeland he was equally disdained by Noucentisme, the new movement which took the place of Modernisme. In 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, Gaudí's workshop in the Sagrada Família was ransacked, and {{a great number of}} his documents, plans and <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|For Batman Begins, Nolan {{preferred}} traditional stuntwork over computer-generated imagery. <b>Scale</b> <b>models</b> {{were used}} to represent the Narrows and Ra's al Ghul's temple. There were, however, several establishing shots that were CG composite images; that is, an image composed of multiple images. Examples include Gotham's skyline, exterior shots of Wayne Tower, {{and some of the}} exterior monorail shots. The climactic monorail sequence mixed live action footage, model work, and CGI.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{influence}} of neo-Gothic art and Oriental techniques, Gaudí {{became part of the}} Modernista movement which was reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work transcended mainstream Modernisme, culminating in an organic style inspired by natural forms. Gaudí rarely drew detailed plans of his works, instead preferring to create them as three-dimensional <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> and moulding the details as he conceived them.|$|E

5|$|Derek Meddings {{and a team}} of 28 {{technicians}} {{completed the}} special effects shots for the film in six months. Their main assignments included the Zero-X launches, re-shot, widescreen launch sequences for the Thunderbird machines, the car chase between Lady Penelope and Parker in FAB1 and the Hood, scenes at The Swinging Star, the Mars shots involving the MEV and the mysterious Rock Snakes, and the ultimate destruction of Zero-X in the climax. Over 300 effects shot were completed with <b>scale</b> <b>models.</b> The team made use of the extra space afforded to them by the new special effects building to experiment with floor-level shots and other more creative camera angles.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision {{that allowed him to}} conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He used to say that he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, an {{exhibition}} in the Grand Palais of Paris {{was devoted to}} his work, during the annual salon of the Société des Beaux-Arts (Fine Arts Society) of France. Gaudí participated on the invitation of count Güell, displaying a series of pictures, plans and plaster <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> of several of his works. Although he participated hors concours, he received good reviews from the French press. A large part of this exposition could be seen the following year at the I Salón Nacional de Arquitectura {{that took place in}} the municipal exhibition hall of El Buen Retiro in Madrid.|$|E

5|$|Later {{that year}} he was {{assigned}} to the Manhattan Project, and moved with his family to Los Alamos, New Mexico. There he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory's Ordnance (O) Division, which was under the command of another Naval officer, Captain William S. Parsons. Initially the goal of the O Division was to design a gun-type nuclear weapon known as Thin Man. This proved to be impractical due to contamination of the reactor-bred plutonium with plutonium-240, and in February 1944, the Division switched its attention {{to the development of the}} Little Boy, a smaller device using uranium-235. Birch used unenriched uranium to create <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> and later full-scale mock-ups of the device.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, Toei {{released}} a 143-minute movie, Yamato, {{based on a}} book by Jun Henmi, to commemorate the 60th anniversary {{of the end of}} World War II; Tamiya released special editions of <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> of the battleship in conjunction with the film's release. Based on a book of the same name, the film is a tale about the sailors aboard the doomed battleship and the concepts of honour and duty. The film was shown on more than 290screens across the country and was a commercial success, taking in a record 5.11billion yen at the domestic box office.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the three}} telescopes was constructed, {{although}} several design {{studies were carried out}} and some <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> were made. This was partly due to the changing political climate over the time (the period was from a Labour Party government under Harold Wilson to a Conservative Party one under Margaret Thatcher), and partly to the financial constraints of astronomical research in the UK at the time. Also, at a vital time, it became necessary to upgrade the Lovell Telescope to the Mark IA, which subsequently overran in terms of cost.|$|E

5|$|Owing to the 1960s {{setting of}} The Secret Service, Derek Meddings and the {{technicians}} {{of the special}} effects department received few commissions for <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> of vehicles that appeared futuristic. This left Unwin's vintage Ford Model T, Gabriel, as their main project, in addition to rendering vehicles and settings common to the decade in miniature and producing the optical enlargement and miniaturisation effects for the character of Harding. Wag Evans manufactured a full-size and two miniature versions (the last of differing scales) of Gabriel, fitting the larger car with belt-driven electric motors, a folding roof, upholstered interior, and a remote control mechanism.|$|E
5|$|As {{the date}} of the {{operation}} approached, training became more intensive. Glider units spent hours aloft every day circling over airfields as they practiced the manoeuvers required to land the airborne forces next to the bridges over the Orne River, the Caen canal, the Dives, and the Merville battery. Once the pilots had practiced this sufficiently during the day, they were then switched to night operations. In the landing grounds used by the division for their operations, dozens of poles similar to those in Normandy were erected, with engineering units then timed on how fast they could demolish the obstacles. The battalion assigned to neutralising Merville spent two weeks at a special camp, where they built a replica of the battery and carried out several rehearsal exercises in and around it. The force assigned to the coup-de-main operation, to capture the bridges over the Orne River and Caen canal, were transferred to Exeter. There, they conducted intensive exercises around the River Exe and the nearby canal that stood in place for their real objective. The pilots of the gliders and transport aircraft were also constantly briefed with thousands of maps and photographs of the landing zones and the surrounding areas, as well as dozens of <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> of the zones and the primary objectives, such as the bridges and the Merville battery. A coloured film was produced from aerial reconnaissance photographs which, when played at the correct speed and height over the <b>scale</b> <b>models,</b> realistically simulated the paths the glider pilots would take towards their landing-zones.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} livery {{variants}} were tested on <b>scale</b> <b>models,</b> which were later exposed at VR's conference centre at Helsinki central railway station: {{one has a}} red strip for the whole length of the train, with the window backgrounds painted grey. The other is more similar to the final result, but {{the front of the}} train includes more red and no grey paint at all. VR finally settled to a combination of both of them, which bore resemblance to the company's InterCity livery. The bottom of the carriages is dark grey, with a red stripe distinguishing it from the white base colour. The top of the carriages is painted grey. Red colouring {{at the end of each}} car forms red parallelograms when the carriages are combined. When asked why the trains were not blue and white, VR's CEO answered that red and white fits the train and its design the best.|$|E
5000|$|Similitude is {{the theory}} and art of {{predicting}} prototype (original object) performance from <b>scale</b> <b>model</b> observations. The main requirement of similitude is all dimensionless quantities must be equal for both the <b>scaled</b> <b>model</b> and the prototype under the conditions the modeler desires to make observations. Dimensionless quantities are generally referred to as Pi terms, or π terms. In many fields the π terms are well established. For example, in fluid dynamics, a well known dimensionless number called the Reynolds number comes up frequently in <b>scale</b> <b>model</b> tests with fluid in motion relative to a stationary surface. [...] Thus, for a <b>scale</b> <b>model</b> test to be reliable, the Reynolds number, {{as well as all}} other important dimensionless quantities, must be equal for both <b>scale</b> <b>model</b> and prototype under the conditions that the modeler wants to observe.|$|R

5|$|Cameron's {{inspiration}} for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. <b>Scale</b> <b>models,</b> computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Playas de Rosarito in Baja California were used to re-create the sinking. The film was partially funded by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200million.|$|E

The film was {{released on}} DVD on November 7, 2006 and on Blu-ray in 2007. The film was accompanied by the short One Man Band for its theatrical and home media releases. Merchandise based on the film (including <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> {{of several of the}} cars) broke records for retail sales of merchandise based on a Disney/Pixar film, bringing an estimated $10 billion for 5 years after the film's release.

5|$|In 2000, the Channel 4 {{television}} programme What Sank the Mary Rose? attempted {{to investigate the}} causes suggested for her sinking by means of experiments with <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> {{of the ship and}} metal weights to simulate the presence of troops on the upper decks. Initial tests showed that the ship was able to make the turn described by eyewitnesses without capsizing. In later tests, a fan was used to create a breeze similar to the one reported to have suddenly sprung up {{on the day of the}} sinking as the real Mary Rose went to make the turn. As the model made the turn, the breeze in the upper works forced it to heel more than at calm, forcing the main deck gun ports below the waterline and foundering the model within a few seconds. The sequence of events closely followed what eyewitnesses had reported, particularly the suddenness with which the ship sank.|$|E

5|$|Morsell {{found it}} {{challenging}} to film a scene {{near the end}} of the game, in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting strapped into the chair with a guillotine overhead. Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed, and Morsell said it was difficult for her to work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take. The torture devices featured in the game were <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> made by local craftsmen. During one scene, the mansion roof starts to collapse, causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors. To achieve this, the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard, which had to fall in the correct sequence. In another scene, Adrienne crawls along a water pipe that breaks. To film the scene without damaging equipment, the crew built a giant plastic box with a plastic tray underneath for the shoot. Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions.|$|E
