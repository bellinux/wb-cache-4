25|$|From 1975 to 1976, Suzuki {{produced}} its RE5 <b>single-rotor</b> Wankel motorcycle. It was {{a complex}} design, with both liquid cooling and oil cooling, and multiple lubrication and carburetor systems. It worked well and was smooth, but being rather heavy, {{and having a}} modest power output of , it did not sell well.|$|E
25|$|The Type 173 was a tandem rotor {{development}} of the earlier Type 171 Sycamore <b>single-rotor</b> helicopter. It used two units of the Sycamore's Leonides Major engine and rotor with a new fuselage. The rotor gearboxes were connected by a shaft which enabled one engine to drive both rotors if an engine failed.|$|E
25|$|The Saunders-Roe Skeeter {{is a light}} all-metal, two-seat <b>single-rotor</b> helicopter, {{complete}} with a tail rotor for torque compensation and yaw control. It was intended to perform as an all-purpose rotorcraft, primarily being used for light civil {{work as well as}} aerial observation and training missions in military service. The handling characteristics were broadly similar to comparably-sized rotorcraft of the era, while possessing the necessary simplicity, robustness, and reliability that commonly typified trainer aircraft.|$|E
25|$|At {{roughly the}} same time as the first {{experiments}} with full-scale aircraft powered with Wankel engines, model aircraft-sized versions were pioneered by a combine of the well-known Japanese O.S. Engines firm and the then-extant German Graupner aeromodeling products firm, under license from NSU/Auto-Union. By 1968 the first prototype air-cooled, <b>single-rotor</b> glow plug-ignition, methanol-fueled 4.9cm3 displacement OS/Graupner model Wankel engine was running, and was produced in at least two differing versions from 1970 to , solely by the O.S. firm after Graupner's demise in 2012.|$|E
25|$|In 1947 Anton Flettner, a German aero-engineer, {{was brought}} to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. He was the {{developer}} of the two earlier synchropter designs from Germany during World War II: the Flettner Fl 265 which pioneered the synchropter layout, and the slightly later Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri ("Hummingbird"), intended for eventual production. Both designs used the principle of counter-rotating side-by-side intermeshing rotors, as the means {{to solve the problem of}} torque compensation, normally countered in <b>single–rotor</b> helicopters by a tail rotor, fenestron, NOTAR, or vented blower exhaust. Flettner remained in the United States and became the chief designer of the Kaman company.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] Suzuki RE5 is a {{motorcycle}} with a liquid-cooled <b>single-rotor</b> Wankel engine, manufactured by Suzuki from 1974 to 1976. [...] Apart from its unusual engine, the RE5 is otherwise a conventional roadster.|$|E
2500|$|AvtoVAZ (...) is the Russian {{automobile}} manufacturer {{formerly known}} as VAZ: Volzhsky Avtomobilny Zavod (ВАЗ, Во́лжский автомоби́льный заво́д, or Volga Automobile Plant). Work began in 1976, with a <b>single-rotor</b> Lada appearing in 1978; the first 250 of these went on sale {{in the summer of}} 1980.|$|E
2500|$|In 1918, Henry and Emile {{patented}} a <b>single-rotor</b> helicopter {{design that}} was not built. [...] Henry Berliner's first effort was updating a new unmanned coaxial test rig. He followed on with a 570lb, 80hp Le Rhône engine powered, test rig that required assistants for stabilization. [...] The rig could lift 900lb. His test rig, with two wheels and handlebars, resembled a wheelbarrow with an engine mounted in it, with a tall vertical shaft driving two counter-rotating propellers.|$|E
2500|$|Initially {{developed}} at Delgado Trades School and completed by Enea Bossi, the two-place side-by-side <b>single-rotor</b> Higgins EB-1 helicopter {{was completed in}} 1943 and built by Higgins Industries, Inc., of New Orleans, Louisiana. Plans for larger versions were terminated following the downturn in the military aviation industry {{following the end of}} World War II. [...] The fuselage was covered in its entirety by a metallic skin, with the tail covered in fabric. A two-bladed vertical tail rotor was included in its design to counter the effects of torque and the landing gear was configured in a fixed tricycle form. The four-bladed main rotor consisted of two pairs of blades mounted one above the other. The interior featured controls similar to those of a conventional airplane.|$|E
2500|$|Mazda of Japan ceased {{production}} of direct drive Wankel engines within their model range in 2012, leaving the motor industry worldwide with no production cars using the engine. The company is continuing {{development of the}} next generation of their Wankel engines, the SkyActiv-R, with a new rear-wheel-drive sports car model announced in October 2015. The company later withdrew this proposed model. Mazda states that the SkyActiv-R solves the three key issues with previous rotary engines: fuel economy, emissions and reliability. Takashi Yamanouchi, the global CEO of Mazda said: [...] "The rotary engine has very good dynamic performance, but it's not so good on economy when you accelerate and decelerate. However, with a range extender you can use a rotary engine at a constant 2,000rpm, at its most efficient. It's compact, too." [...] No Wankel engine in this arrangement has yet been used in production vehicles or planes. However, in November 2013 Mazda announced to the motoring press a series-hybrid prototype car, the Mazda2 EV, using a Wankel engine as a range extender. The engine, located under the rear luggage floor, is a tiny, almost inaudible, <b>single-rotor</b> 330cc unit, generating [...] at 4,500rpm, and maintaining a continuous electric output of 20kW. In October 2017 Mazda announced that the rotary engine would be utilised in a hybrid car with 2019 the introduction date.|$|E
50|$|The Gazda Helicospeeder was an American-built single-seat <b>single-rotor</b> {{helicopter}} of the 1940s.|$|E
50|$|Wankel engines produce {{high power}} outputs for {{their size and}} weight, and several {{attempts}} were made to produce Wankel powered motorcycles in the 1970s. Yamaha and Kawasaki exhibited Wankel-powered motorcycles in 1972, but neither company manufactured one. German manufacturer Hercules, a member of the Sachs-controlled Zweirad Union, produced their <b>single-rotor</b> W2000 from 1974 to 1977. Suzuki produced their <b>single-rotor</b> RE5 from 1975 to 1976. Van Veen built 38 OCR1000 motorcycles with twin-rotor Comotor engines between 1978 and 1981.|$|E
50|$|The Hewland AE75 {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the Austro Engine AE75R, a Wankel aero-engine developed from the MidWest AE50, a <b>single-rotor</b> version of the AE100.|$|E
50|$|The CH-53E and the MH-53E are {{the largest}} {{helicopters}} in the Western world, while the CH-53K now being developed will be even larger. They are fourth {{in the world to}} the Russian Mil Mi-26 Halo <b>single-rotor</b> helicopter and the enormous, twin transverse rotored Mil V-12 Homer, which can lift more than 22 tons (20 tonnes) and 44 tons (40 tonnes), respectively and the Mi-26's <b>single-rotor</b> predecessor Mil Mi-6, which has less payload (12 tonnes) but is bigger and has a higher MTOW at 42 tonnes.|$|E

50|$|Dissymmetry of lift in {{rotorcraft}} aerodynamics {{refers to}} an uneven amount of lift {{on opposite sides of}} the rotor disc. It is a phenomenon that affects <b>single-rotor</b> helicopters and autogyros in forward flight.|$|E
50|$|The Bell 47J Ranger is an American {{single-engine}} <b>single-rotor</b> light helicopter {{manufactured by}} Bell Helicopter. It was an executive {{variant of the}} highly successful Bell 47 {{and was the first}} helicopter to carry a United States president.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} special thin-gauge sheet aluminum for lightness. Its 7.45 m span wing has an area of 9.6 m2 and lacks flaps. The standard engine used is a [...] Woelfe Aixro XF40 <b>single-rotor</b> Wankel engine.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, VAZ {{was given}} {{permission}} to begin producing Wankel engines under licence from NSU. Work began in 1976, with a <b>single-rotor</b> Lada appearing in 1978; the first 250 of these {{went on sale}} {{in the summer of}} 1980.|$|E
5000|$|Diamond bought MidWest and {{transferred}} the engine rights to Austro Engine, a company founded in 2007 and located in Wiener Neustadt. Diamond discontinued {{production of the}} MidWest twin-rotor engine, but for a period they continued with the <b>single-rotor</b> model, mainly for the motor glider market. Diamond then designed and produced two replacement models, both <b>single-rotor</b> Wankel engines: the [...] Austro Engine AE50R and the [...] Austro Engine AE75R. These new designs feature liquid cooling with forced-air rotor cooling, metered oil lubrication pumped to the main bearings (directly) and to the rotor tips (via the inlet manifold), with partial oil recovery, dual ignition, and electric starting (all of which were features of the MidWest engines). They also have electronic fuel injection.|$|E
50|$|A {{small series}} of {{prototype}} coupés, the M35 were produced as test vehicles for loyal customers — testing the <b>single-rotor</b> Comotor Wankel engine, as also {{seen in the}} NSU Spider. A twin-rotor version of this engine reached production form with the NSU Ro 80 and GS Birotor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine was}} an {{air-cooled}} <b>single-rotor</b> Wankel designed by Sachs as a snowmobile engine, that produced [...] at 6,500 RPM. The rotor spun about the frame's longitudinal axis (see longitudinal engine for the piston-engine equivalent), with power {{taken to the}} transmission through a 90° bevel gear.|$|E

50|$|In 2012 the XU {{switched}} to belt drive {{and to a}} <b>single-rotor</b> brushless AC motor, reducing bike maintenance. Battery capacity increased by 50%, and both range and top speed improved. The onboard 1 kW charger allows 95% charging in 3.4 hours, and an optional quick charge accessory allows 95% charging in 1.7 hours.|$|E
50|$|Having two coaxial sets of rotors {{provides}} {{symmetry of}} forces around the central axis for lifting {{the vehicle and}} laterally when flying in any direction. Because of the mechanical complexity, many helicopter designs use alternate configurations to avoid problems that arise when only one rotor is used. Common alternatives are <b>single-rotor</b> helicopters or tandem rotor arrangements.|$|E
5000|$|The Fichtel & Sachs <b>single-rotor</b> {{engine of}} 300 cc swept-volume {{as used in}} the Hercules - the only commercially {{available}} engine at the time - {{was used as a}} basis by BSA's project engineer David Garside in the early 1970s when designing a twin-rotor motorcycle engine of 588 cc, which reached production as the [...] "Norton Classic".|$|E
5000|$|The Bell OH-58 Kiowa is {{a family}} of single-engine, <b>single-rotor,</b> {{military}} helicopters used for observation, utility, and direct fire support. Bell Helicopter manufactured the OH-58 for the United States Army based on its Model 206A JetRanger helicopter. The OH-58 was in continuous U.S. Army service from 1969 to 2017, when it was retired and replaced in this role by the AH-64 Apache.|$|E
50|$|Envisage a {{viewpoint}} above a <b>single-rotor</b> helicopter {{in still}} air.

At all points around the disc mapped out by the blade-tips, {{the speed of the}} blade-tip relative to the air is the same: everything is balanced.|$|E
50|$|The Bell YOH-4 (originally YHO-4) was a single-engine, <b>single-rotor</b> light helicopter, {{developed}} for the United States Army's Light Observation Helicopter program. While the YOH-4A was unsuccessful in the original LOH competition, Bell redesigned it as the sleek Bell 206A JetRanger for the commercial market, and enjoyed instant and lasting success. In 1967, the Army reopened the LOH competition, and the 206A-based OH-58 Kiowa was selected.|$|E
50|$|While {{its engine}} was revolutionary, in other respects, such as appearance, {{suspension}} and brakes, the Norton Classic was a conventional twin-shock roadster. The fork stanchions were protected by rubber gaiters; {{and a full}} enclosure protected the final-drive chain. The air-cooled Classic was lighter and more powerful than its only Wankel competitor in production, the over-complicated <b>single-rotor</b> Suzuki RE-5 motorcycle (which had liquid-cooled jackets and an oil-cooled rotor).|$|E

50|$|Mil's creations won many {{domestic}} and international awards and set 69 world records. Most notably, the Mil Mi-4 won a Gold Medal in the Brussels International Exhibition in 1958. In 1971, after his death, his Mil Mi-12 won the Sikorsky Prize {{as the most powerful}} helicopter in the world. Unlike his Soviet counterpart, Nikolai Kamov, Mil enjoyed great prestige due to his <b>single-rotor</b> helicopters, as Kamov used the co-axial rotor layout, which was more controversial.|$|E
5000|$|AMF Microflight began {{production}} of the Chevvron in 1987, with 19 completed at their Membury factory by 1990. A single example was built of the Sea Chevvron, a floatplane version fitted with a more powerful (...) König engine, while examples were also fitted with a [...] Limbach engine. In total, 41 Chevvrons were built. [...] In the 1990s, as <b>single-rotor</b> wankel engine from the MidWest AE series was successfully fitted to a Chevvron.|$|E
