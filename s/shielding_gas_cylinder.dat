Generally, working area is tightly sealed, and a negative pressure is operating, to allow potential radioactive exhaust to be collected to safe containment systems, such as <b>shielded</b> <b>gas</b> <b>cylinders</b> or retardation pipes. Qualification extent for hot cells is dependent on their complexity, that may range from a simple working surface surrounded by an adequate lead shielding, to fully automated dispensing system which are embedded and integrated in the hot cell whole structure.

40|$|Purpose: Generally {{discrete}} alternate {{supply of}} <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> {{is a new}} technology which alternately supplies {{the different kinds of}} <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> in weld zone. In this study, welding characteristics under variation of alternate supply method of <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> in austenite stainless steel using a GTA welding process have been investigated and found the relationship between welding distortions and welding speed and different types of <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> and <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> supply. Design/methodology/approach: 2 -D axisymmetric heat and fluid mathematical model about welding arc and weld pool has been developed for verifying the effect of alternate supply of <b>shielding</b> <b>gas.</b> The developed models were solved using a general thermofluid-mechanics computer program, PHOEINCS code, which is based on SIMPLE algorithm. Findings: The computed results showed that the developed computational models are very adequate to predict in the weld pool and bead geometry, and the technique of alternate supply of <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> should be useful to increase higher productivity, cost savings and better quality in arc welding. Research limitations/implications: The effect of alternate supply of <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> should be useful to apply for a narrow -gap welding process.

40|$|With {{an ongoing}} demand {{to improve the}} {{efficiency}} of the gas metal arc welding process, steps are being taken to reduce the <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> consumption. However, sufficient <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> coverage of the weld region is essential for the generation of high quality welds, and drafts can be detrimental to its efficiency. In industry, the general practise to ensure coverage is to increase the <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate, however, too high a flow rate can induce undesirable turbulence in the <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> column, whilst adding unnecessary cost to the process. A simplified computational fluid dynamics model has been generated, and validated through extensive experimental trials, to accurately model the <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> flow when subjected to the adverse effects of cross drafts. Several nozzle geometry changes have been investigated with the aim of improving the <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> column’s resistance to drafts, eliminating the requirement to increase the <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} process to fully {{evaluate}} the effects of an alternating <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> supply on <b>gas</b> <b>shielded</b> welding processes, a comparison between the arc pressures generated using argon, helium, alternating <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> and pulsed GTAW has been conducted. Arc pressure variation and peaking are two of the fundamental phenomena produced during the alternating <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> process and are said to help create a stirring action within the liquid weld metal. However, there is no published data on arc pressure measurements during an alternating <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> supply and, consequently, these phenomena are based solely on theoretical assumptions. The experimental measurements made have shown that alternating <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> produces considerably higher arc pressures than argon, helium and pulsed GTAW due to a surge at weld initiation. The transient arc pressure measurements made when using alternating <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> are also considerably different from the theoretical assumptions previously reported...|$|R

The TIG {{pulse welding}} of 15 Cr- 4 Ni- 8 Mn- 1. 3 Cu {{austenitic}} stainless steel at pulse currents of 130 and 160 A with Argon <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> containing 0 %, 5 % and 10 % (v/v) Nitrogen was investigated. The effects of pulse current and Nitrogen content in Argon <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> on the microstructure and mechanical properties of weld metal were studied. Based on the results found in this study, the nitrogen content in weld metal was found to increase with increasing nitrogen content in argon <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> and pulse current. With the addition of nitrogen in Argon <b>shielding</b> <b>gas,</b> the morphology of delta-ferrites was changed from the conventional TIG pulse welding using pure Argon <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> where both lathy and vermicular types were found. However, with the Nitrogen + Argon <b>shielding</b> <b>gas,</b> only vermicular type was observed. Moreover, the arm spacing of delta-ferrite can be enlarged by increasing the pulse current.

Because of particularity and specificity of the place where it is used, the explosion suppression fire extinguisher’s body itself is commonly called the special <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The material for special <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> selected and used in the earliest design is mainly the ordinary steel <b>gas</b> <b>cylinders</b> such as the carbon structural steel <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Because of the following characteristics: being rich in their resources, the prices are low and the process is simple, they can meet the requirements for the use in many kinds of places, and up to now, there are still used widely.

40|$|Studies {{have been}} carried out to {{determine}} the effects of implementing alternating <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> for 6082 T 6 aluminium alloy welding. Alternating <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> is a newly developed method of supplying <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> to the weld area to enhance the efficiency of the standard Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) process. This method involves discretely supplying two different <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> to the weld zone at a pre-determined frequency which creates a dynamic action in the weld pool. Several benefits have been identified in relation to supplying <b>shielding</b> <b>gases</b> in this manner including increased travel speed, reduced distortion, reduced porosity and, in the case of specific alternating frequencies, marginal improvements in mechanical properties. All in all, this method of <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> delivery presents attractive benefits to the manufacturing community, namely the increased productivity and quality in addition to a reduction in the amount of post-weld straightening required. However, the literature available on this advanced joining process is very scant, especially so for aluminium alloys.

40|$|A <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> {{flow rate}} of 15 – 20 L min 21 is {{typically}} specified in {{metal inert gas}} welding, but is often adjusted to as high as 36 L min 21 by welders in practice. Not only is this overuse of <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> wasteful, but uncontrolled high gas flows can lead to significant turbulence induced porosity in the final weld. There is therefore a need to understand and control the minimum <b>shield</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate used in practical welding where cross-drafts may affect the coverage.

40|$|Argon is {{generally}} used as <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> for laser welding. As Argon is an inert gas it doesnot have {{influence on the}} microstructure of the weld material or on the heat input of the weld,whereas nitrogen has solubility to austenite. Therefore nitrogen as an interstitial atomincreases the hardness of the weld. This has been detected when comparing the hardnessprofiles of nitrogen shielded welds of austenitic stainless steel with Argon shielded welds. Nitrogen as the <b>shielding</b> <b>gas</b> can compensate the softer structure of the weld in workhardenedand nitrogen-alloyed steels. For the duplex stainless steel grades the nitrogen additions promote formation ofaustenite in the weld, which decreases the risk of lowered toughness.

40|$|Compressed <b>gas</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{contaminated}} with radionuclides are a unique waste item that {{may become a}} Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste through two mechanisms: either {{the contents of the}} compressed <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> are regulated under RCRA or the internal pressure of the compressed <b>gas</b> <b>cylinder</b> gives it the characteristic of reactivity. The characteristic of reactivity is defined by RCRA in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 261. 23 (a) (6) as a waste that is capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating source or heated under confinement. In a letter dated September 1, 1989, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Solid Waste referred the interpretation of the definition of reactivity to the EPA Regional Office and/or the state (if the state has primacy). The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) has made the interpretation that to meet the definition of reactive as specified in 40 CFR 261. 23 (a) (6) there must be a chemical reaction that causes the explosion or detonation. This interpretation limits the compressed <b>gas</b> <b>cylinders</b> that have to be treated as RCRA hazardous waste to those that have other RCRA characteristic codes or contain listed wastes.
