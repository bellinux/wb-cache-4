This paper {{presents}} channel capacities of parallel and <b>serial</b> modulo-sum relay <b>networks.</b> A parallel relay network consists of one source, multiple relays in parallel, and one destination node. A <b>serial</b> relay <b>network</b> consists of one source, multiple relays in serial, and one destination node. Each relay employs a quantize-and-forward (QAF) strategy. Each node including source, multiple relays, and destination, employs its own codebook for its own encoding and or decoding. Every node has information of the other nodes codebooks. And every addition in any channel is a modulo-sum. First, this paper presents the capacities for the binary modulo-sum symmetric parallel, and <b>serial</b> relay <b>networks,</b> assuming that the channels are discrete and memoryless. Second, this paper claims that the capacities obtained are strictly below the cut-set bounds except the trivial cases. Third, this paper extends the capacities obtained for the binary modulo-sum relay networks to the m-ary modulo-sum relay networks. Finally, this paper presents the closed form capacities for a worst direct channel which is a binary modulo-sum symmetric channel with a crossover probability of 1 / 2. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Furthermore, the bound (e), for all d> 1, holds under an additional mild condition on the distributions. This latter bound is shown to be tight.

40|$|Abstract Moving data between {{processes}} {{has often}} been discussed {{as one of the}} major bottlenecks in parallel computing—there is a large body of research, striving to improve communication latency and bandwidth on different networks, measured with ping-pong benchmarks of different message sizes. In practice, the data to be communicated generally originates from application data structures and needs to be serialized before communicating it over <b>serial</b> <b>network</b> channels. This serialization is often done by explicitly copying the data to communication buffers. The message passing interface (MPI) standard defines derived datatypes to allow zero-copy formulations of non-contiguous data access patterns. However, many applications still choose to implement manual pack/unpack loops, partly because they are more efficient than some MPI implementations. MPI implementers on the other hand do not have good benchmarks that represent important application access patterns. We demonstrate that the data serialization can consume up to 80 % of the total communication overhead for important applications. This indicates that most of the current research on optimizing <b>serial</b> <b>network</b> transfer times may be targeted at the smaller fraction of the communication overhead. To support the scientific community, we extracted the send/recv-buffer access patterns of a representative set of scientific applications to build a benchmark that includes serialization and communication of application data and thus reflects all communication overheads. This can be used like traditional pingpong benchmarks to determine the holistic communication latency and bandwidt...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{interaction}} between pricing and capacity decisions on simple serial and parallel transport networks. When individual links of the network are operated by different regional or national authorities, toll and capacity competition is likely to result. Moreover, the problem is potentially complicated by the presence of both local and transit demand on each link of the network. We bring together and extend the recent literature on the topic and, using both theory and numerical simulation techniques, provide a careful comparison of toll and capacity interaction on <b>serial</b> and parallel <b>network</b> structures. First, we show that there is more tax exporting in serial transport corridors than on competing parallel road networks. Second, the inability to toll transit has quite dramatic negative welfare effects on parallel networks. On the contrary, in serial transport corridors it may actually be undesirable to allow the tolling of transit at all. Third, if the links are exclusively used by transit transport, toll and capacity decisions are independent in <b>serial</b> <b>networks.</b> This does not generally hold in the presence of local transport. Moreover, it contrasts with a parallel setting where regional authorities compete for transit; in that case, regional investment in capacity leads to lower Nash equilibrium tolls. congestion pricing, transport investment, transit traffic...|$|R
