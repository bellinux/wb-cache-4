25|$|This spring flowed {{toward the}} temple but {{disappeared}} beneath, creating a cleft which emitted chemical vapors {{that caused the}} Oracle at Delphi to reveal her prophecies. Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, <b>since</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> child of Gaia.

25|$|In November 1999, she {{publicly}} {{announced that}} she had epilepsy with a four-part series, Living with Epilepsy, on stayhealthy.com, for Epilepsy Awareness Month, and in a newspaper feature in the Fayetteville Observer. In the interview with the Observer, she revealed that she had attempted to hide her condition, <b>since</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> teenager, and had tried to make her body as healthy as possible {{to compensate for the}} condition. In the interview, she said that she became an overachiever in an effort to tell herself that she was okay.|$|E
25|$|The Empress's faction lacked an {{equivalent}} war leader to Stephen. Matilda had a firm grounding in government from her time as empress, {{where she had}} presided in court cases and acted as regent in Italy with the Imperial army on campaign. Nonetheless, Matilda, as a woman, could not personally lead forces into battle. Matilda was less popular with contemporary chroniclers than Stephen; in many ways she took after her father, being prepared to loudly demand compliance of her court, when necessary issuing threats and generally appearing arrogant. This was felt to be particularly inappropriate <b>since</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> woman. Matilda's husband, Geoffrey of Anjou, {{played an important role}} in seizing Normandy during the war but did not cross into England. Geoffrey and Matilda's marriage was not an easy one; it had almost collapsed altogether in 1130.|$|E
50|$|Hepburn's {{portrayal}} of Holly Golightly as the naïve, eccentric socialite {{is generally considered}} to be the actress's most memorable and identifiable role.

25|$|Rumiko Takahashi {{was born}} in Niigata, Japan. Although she showed little {{interest}} in manga during her childhood, {{she was said to}} occasionally doodle in the margins of her papers while attending Niigata Chūō High School. Takahashi's interest in manga did not start until later. In an interview in 2000, Takahashi said that she had always wanted to become a professional comic author <b>since</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> child. During her university years, she enrolled in Gekiga Sonjuku, a manga school founded by Kazuo Koike, author of Crying Freeman and Lone Wolf and Cub. Under his guidance Takahashi began to publish her first dōjinshi creations in 1975, such as Bye-Bye Road and Star of Futile Dust. Koike often urged his students to create well-thought out, interesting characters, and this influence would greatly impact Rumiko Takahashi's works throughout her career.|$|E
25|$|The {{handsome}} scribe Kameni {{has fallen}} in love with Renisenb, and eventually asks her to marry him. Unsure whether she loves him or her father's advisor Hori, whom she has known <b>since</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> child, she leaves the choice effectively in her father's hands and becomes engaged to Kameni. She realises, however, that his relationship with Nofret was closer than she had supposed, and that jealousy may have influenced Nofret's bitter hatred towards the family. Hori and Esa, the elderly mother of Imhotep (a clever woman who although almost completely blind sees things clearer than most others - especially her son) begin to investigate the possibility of a human murderer. Ipy, himself a likely suspect, starts to boast about his new, better position with his father; he plots to get rid of housekeeper Henet and tells her so. The next morning, Ipy is found dead in the lake, drowned.|$|E
25|$|The Progressives {{were founded}} {{during the late}} 1870s {{by a group of}} yangban who fully {{supported}} Westernization of Joseon. However, they wanted immediate Westernization, including a complete cut-off of ties with Qing China. Unaware of their anti-Chinese sentiments, the Queen Consort granted frequent audiences and meetings with them to discuss progressivism and nationalism. They advocated for educational and social reforms, including the equality of the sexes by granting women full rights, issues that were not even acknowledged in their already Westernized neighbor of Japan. The Queen Consort was completely enamored by the Progressives in the beginning, but when she learned that they were deeply anti-Chinese, she quickly turned her back on them. Cutting ties with China immediately was not in her gradual plan of Westernization. She saw the consequences Joseon would have to face if she did not play China and Japan off by the West gradually, especially <b>since</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> strong advocate of the Sadae faction who were pro-China and pro-gradual Westernization.|$|E

50|$|Jay (Ed O'Neill) asks Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) {{for legal}} advice for Gloria (Sofía Vergara) who had <b>been</b> {{involved}} in <b>a</b> car crash. While Mitchell thinks {{that it is}} not Gloria's fault, Manny (Rico Rodriguez) informs him that it was his mom's fault <b>since</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> terrible driver.|$|R
25|$|After {{returning}} to London in 1835, {{and using a}} small legacy to purchase a house in Marylebone, Palmer produced less mystical and more conventional work. Part of his reason in {{returning to}} London was to sell his work and earn money from private teaching. He had better health on his return to London, and was by then married to Hannah, daughter of the painter John Linnell who he had known <b>since</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> child, and married when she was nineteen and he was thirty-two. He sketched in Devonshire and Wales around this time. His peaceful vision of rural England had been disillusioned by the violent rural discontent of the early 1830s. His small financial legacy was running out {{and he decided to}} produce work more in line with public taste if he was to earn an income for himself and his wife. He was following the advice of his father-in-law. Linnell, who had earlier shown remarkable understanding of the uniqueness of William Blake's genius, was not as generous with his son-in-law, towards whom his attitude was authoritarian and often harsh.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Lopez-De La Cruz ran {{the first}} UFW hiring hall {{which was built}} next to the De La Cruz home. She {{collected}} membership dues, printed announcements for rallies, and distributed groceries that were donated by churches, social agencies, and private citizens. Lopez-De La Cruz also assisted farmworkers by translating for them, taking them to the doctors, writing letters, and filling out paperwork for {{those who could not}} write. In addition to her work protesting, organizing, and running the hiring hall; Lopez-De La Cruz acted as an interpreter for farm workers and often testified at hearings on farm labor, pushed for food stamps for farm workers in Fresno, pushed for bilingual education, and was eventually appointed to community and state organizations like the Fresno County Economic Opportunity Commission, the Central California Action Associates (Community education project where she taught English to Farm workers), and California’s Commission on the Status of Women. In 1966 Lopez-De La Cruz volunteered to teach farm workers practical English at the CCAA in an old building on Olive Avenue in Fresno, CA. When the CCAA got a local TV show on Fresno’s Channel 53, Lopez-De La Cruz enthusiastically taught English on the show for a short period that ended when Arnold’s truck broke down. Lopez-De La Cruz also assisted the UFW by consulting as an expert farmworker. In 1971, Delores Huerta reached out to Lopez-De La Cruz to help her negotiate a contract with Christian Brothers Wine Company. <b>Since</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> farm worker and Huerta was not, Lopez-De La Cruz could accurately know how much work was acceptable and for what pay. In 1972 she represented the Christian Brothers Workers at the first convention of the United Farm Workers of America in Fresno.|$|E

500|$|Min grew up {{mostly in}} Littleton, Colorado, where her family moved {{just before she}} started first grade.

500|$|Since she had {{not seen}} the musical <b>since</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> child, Stefani went to Broadway to better {{understand}} the theme that [...] "even if you're poor and you have love, you're rich." [...] The idea which became the final version came to Stefani while brainstorming on her treadmill. She commented that the troubles in writing the song came because [...] "Dre was really pushing me to write in a new way", but when she presented him with the song, [...] "he just totally tricked the track out." ...|$|E
500|$|Her {{deception}} did {{not last}} long, for Capt. Hermógenes Cámus saw through her disguise immediately—because of her curved figure and [...] "feminine beauty," [...] he said. Nonetheless, he allowed her to be an unauthorised army cantinière and nurse. These were the only positions available to women in the army at the time, and many women effectively served as both, which Morales did. As a cantinière, she sold food and drink to supplement soldiers' monotonous basic rations, staying with them at their camp and marching with them on operations, and <b>since</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> nurse, {{she had to be}} present immediately after battles to care for the wounded.|$|E

50|$|Although Julian's {{views were}} not typical, the {{authorities}} {{might not have}} challenged her theology because of her status as an anchoress. A lack of references to her work during her own time may indicate that the religious authorities did not count her worthy of refuting, <b>since</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> obscure woman.|$|R
