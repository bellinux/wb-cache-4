25|$|Most Diaspora Jews {{identify}} with Zionism {{and have done}} so since the 1930s, {{in the sense that}} they support the State of Israel, even if they do not choose to emigrate; the Zionist movement also has undertaken a variety of roles to encourage <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>Israel.</b> These have included encouraging immigration and assisting immigrants in absorption and integration, fund-raising on behalf of needs and development, encouraging private capital investment, and mobilizing public opinion <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> internationally.

25|$|Recent {{years have}} brought more {{discussion}} of the party's stance on Israel as polls reported declining <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> among the party faithful.

25|$|In part, {{this change}} was {{reflected}} in the effort to restore traditional Canadian <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> as the only democracy in the Middle East.

25|$|Paul was in Congress when Israel bombed Iraq's Osirak {{nuclear plant}} in 1981 and—unlike the United Nations and the Reagan administration—defended {{its right to}} do so.

50|$|At a {{time when}} {{progress}} appeared possible in the region, the Israeli military launched an airstrike on a suspected Hezbollah hideout in Qana, Lebanon, that killed 20-60 civilians. The airstrike seemed to sour <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>Israel's</b> endeavor and Lebanon cancelled a visit by Rice as a result. While the tragedy was a setback in the negotiation process, {{it seemed to be}} a turning point <b>for</b> <b>Israel,</b> who, afterward, began taking a path toward a cease-fire. Before Rice left the region on July 27, she was able to negotiate a 48-hour halt on Israeli air-raids.|$|R
50|$|Following the war, the {{perception}} in Washington was that many Arab states (notably Egypt) had permanently drifted toward the Soviets. In 1968, with {{strong support from}} Congress, Johnson approved the sale of Phantom fighters to Israel, establishing the precedent <b>for</b> US <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>Israel's</b> qualitative military edge over its neighbors. However, the US continued to provide military equipment to Arab states such as Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, to counter Soviet arms sales in the region.|$|R
40|$|A strong {{majority}} of Americans believe Israel is justified in taking {{action against the}} Hezbollah militia. But recent polls also show that U.

Like other publics abroad, {{a majority in the}} United States believes Israel’s military campaign has gone too far...|$|R
25|$|Congress has {{monitored}} the aid issue closely {{along with other}} issues in bilateral relations, and its concerns have affected Administrations' policies.

25|$|Sweden {{voted in}} favor of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947.

However, from 1969, Sweden became more critical of Israel. In October 2014 Sweden officially recognized the State of Palestine as the first European Union and Western country.|$|E
25|$|Like {{elsewhere}} in the world, spikes in anti-Americanism in the region correlate with the adoption or reiteration of certain policies by the U.S. government, in special its <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> in the occupation of Palestine and the Iraq War. In regards to 9/11, a Gallup poll noted, for example, that while most (93%) Muslims polled opposed the attack, 7% of them (called 'radicals' in the survey) supported it, citing in their favor, not religious view points, but disgust at U.S. policies. In effect, when targeting U.S. or other Western assets in the region, radical armed groups in the Middle East, Al-Qaeda included, have made reference to U.S. policies and alleged crimes against humanity to justify their attacks. For example, to explain the Khobar Towers bombing (in which 19 American airmen were killed), Bin Laden, although proven to have not committed the attack, named U.S. <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>Israel</b> in instances of attacks against Muslims, such as the Sabra and Shatila massacre and the Qana massacre, as the reasons behind the attack.|$|E

In the US, this intra-community conflict expanded to domestic politics following the United States presidential election, 2016.
