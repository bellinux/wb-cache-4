40|$|In {{manipulation}} {{tasks that}} require object acquisition, pre-grasp interaction such as <b>sliding</b> <b>adjusts</b> {{the object in}} the environment before grasping. This change in object placement can improve grasping success by making desired grasps reachable. However, the additional sliding action prior to grasping introduces more complexity to the motion planning process, since the hand pose relative to the object {{does not need to}} remain fixed during the pre-grasp interaction. Furthermore, anthropomorphic hands in humanoid robots have several degrees of freedom that could be utilized to improve the object interaction beyond a fixed grasp shape. We present a framework for synthesizing pre-grasp interactions for high-dimensional anthropomorphic manipulators. The motion planning is tractable because information from pre-grasp manipulation examples reduces the search space to promising hand poses and shapes. In particular, we show the value of organizing the example data according to object category templates. The template information focuses the search based on the object features, resulting in increased success of adapting a template pose and decreased planning time.

Following analysis of protein side-chain motions upon ligand binding in 63 complexes, we tested the ability of the docking tool SLIDE to model these motions appropriately without restricting them to rotameric transitions or deciding which side chains should be modeled as flexible. The model encoded and tested is that side-chain conformational changes involving more atoms or larger angles {{are likely to be more}} costly and less prevalent than small motions due to energy barriers between rotamers and the potential of large motions to cause new steric clashes. Accordingly, <b>SLIDE</b> <b>adjusts</b> the protein and ligand side groups as little as necessary to achieve steric complementarity. We tested the hypothesis that small motions are sufficient to achieve good dockings for 63 ligands into the apo structures of 20 different proteins and compared SLIDE side-chain rotations to those experimentally observed between apo and ligand-bound structures.

50|$|The {{sound of}} a reed pipe is {{produced}} by a beating reed: wind is directed towards a curved piece of brass (the reed). A partial vacuum is created by higher velocity air flowing under the reed which causes it to be pulled closed against a hard surface called the shallot. This shuts off the vacuum and allows the reed to spring open again. A tuned resonator extends above this assembly and reinforces the sound produced. The principle {{is the same as}} that of the orchestral clarinet. The pitch of a reed pipe is determined primarily by the length of the reed but the volume of air in the resonator supports that frequency. Most reed pipes have a <b>slide</b> to <b>adjust</b> the vibrating length of the reed to fine-tune it.

These instruments are 1.5-2.5 cm in diameter and can be anywhere from 20 to 40 cm in length. Stabules have either fipple or reed. Reed stabules were usually made from wood or reed with mouthpiece also made either from reed or wood. Fipple stabules were usually made of wood, although in some areas clay and bark stabules of this type were made and bone stabules have been found by archaeologists. A similar more simple type of stabule without finger holes {{can be made from}} willow bark. This type of instrument differs in that its end (opposite to mouthpiece) is plugged. The plug is generally meant for tuning the stabule, but sometimes also used as a <b>slide</b> to <b>adjust</b> tone while playing. All bark stabules were usually made in spring when bark is looser - the features of the stabule are carved right on a fresh broom of willow and the bark is then slid off; the remaining branch is then used to make the fipple and, for the simpler type of stabules, the plug.

50|$|Some tubas have a {{compensating}} {{system to}} allow accurate tuning when using several valves in combination, simplifying fingering and removing {{the need to}} constantly <b>adjust</b> <b>slide</b> positions. The most popular of the automatic compensation systems was invented by Blaikley (Bevan, 1874) and was patented by Boosey (later, Boosey and Hawkes, which also, later still, produced Besson instruments). The patent on the system limited its application outside of Britain, {{and to this day}} tubas with compensating valves are primarily popular in the United Kingdom and countries of the former British Empire. The Blaikley design plumbs the instrument so that if the fourth valve is used, the air is sent back through a second set of branches in the first three valves to compensate for the combination of valves. This does have the disadvantage of making the instrument significantly more 'stuffy' or resistant to air flow when compared to a non-compensating tuba. This is due to the need for the air to flow through the valves twice. It also makes the instrument heavier. But many prefer this approach to additional valves or to manipulation of tuning slides while playing to achieve improved intonation within an ensemble. Most modern professional-grade euphoniums also now feature Blaikley-style compensating valves.|$|R

40|$|Real-time {{controllable}} (RTC) mechanisms {{refer to}} those mechanisms driven by RTC actuators or servomotors. There are many benefits to an R TC mechanism that is force balanced. A novel method called the Adjusting Kinematic Parameters method for force balancing of R TC mechanisms is more promising than the Counterweights method. The motivation {{of the research}} described in this thesis is to overcome {{the problems with the}} present Adjusting Kinematic Parameters method and further extend it to be more general and robust. The extended Adjusting Kinematic Parameters method is presented in this thesis. This method can work for any general mass distribution of a closed-loop RTC mechanism, and is extended to incorporate the masses of <b>adjusting</b> <b>sliding</b> blocks. The extended Adjusting Kinematic Parameters method has been verified to be consistently better than the Counterweights method for closed-loop RTC mechanisms. The generic task of an RTC mechanism is trajectory tracking. Trajectory planning is needed for trajectory tracking. A new method for trajectory planning that can achieve C 3 continuity is developed in this thesis. The new method, based on quintic polynomials for trajectory planning, can insure that the trajectory has a smooth acceleration curve and a continuous jerk on the trajectory. The dynamics of an R TC mechanism is important for developing a better controller to achieve optimal trajectory tracking performance. To study the extended AKP method, the dynamic model of a 2 degree of freedom RTC mechanism is developed with consideration of the off-line mass center of a link using the reduced order method. Stability analysis for the Proportional Derivative (PD) control applied to the closed-loop RTC mechanism is discussed. Dynamic control {{is an essential part of}} an RTC mechanism. Based on the analysis of the existing Nonlinear P D control method and the Computed Torque Control method, a novel PD-based control method, namely, the Evolutionary PD control method, is proposed. The Evolutionary PD method incorporates plant dynamics into the control law in such a way that the control law is the result of the superposition of a series of runs of a controlled plant system. Case studies are carried out for force balanced mechanisms using the extended Adjusting Kinematic Parameters method, the Counterweights method, and the unbalanced mechanism in terms of the joint forces, trajectory tracking performance, and fluctuation of the torques in the actuators. Three control laws (i. e., PD control, Nonlinear PD control, and Evolutionary PD control) are used to perform the feedback control for several case studies. All the simulation results show that the extended Adjusting Kinematic Parameters method is better than the Counterweights method with respect to the reduction of joint forces and trajectory tracking errors. It is also shown that the Evolutionary PD control law is a promising control law when compared with the PDlNonlinear PD control laws in terms of the selection of control gain and high trajectory tracking performance...|$|R
