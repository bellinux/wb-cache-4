40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} to describe the temporal behaviour of the concentrations of a pollutant tracer within the urban environment of Barrow-in-Furness, NW England. The tracer used was 137 Cs derived primarily from wet deposition, on 3 May 1986, of the radioactive cloud from the Chernobyl reactor accident (28 April 1986). The 137 Cs activity deposited during this primary event was supplemented by a small <b>secondary</b> atmospheric deposition <b>input</b> of resuspended activity. The model was validated against the measured temporal behaviour of 137 Cs in urban dust for two outdoor reservoirs in which the only observed input of dust and activity was by atmospheric deposition. Further modelling studies on other reservoirs (both outdoors and indoors) confirmed the existence of additional input fluxes of dust and activity; the most significant of these being the mechanical transport of soil and degradation of construction material (outdoors) and the mechanical transport of outdoor dust and soil and incorporation of organic material (indoors). The model enabled estimates of the magnitudes of these additional fluxes to be made and mean dust mass residence times to be calculated (outdoors, 250 ± 110 d; indoors 29 ± 1 d, indicating {{the length of time}} that conservative dust-bound pollutants would be expected to remain in urban reservoirs with no <b>secondary</b> <b>inputs</b> following the primary contamination event. These residence times correspond to environmental half-lives of 170 ± 70 d outdoors and 20 ± 1 d indoors, for reservoirs which only receive a single primary input of a contaminant. Where <b>secondary</b> <b>inputs</b> of pollutants occur, such as the atmospheric deposition of resuspended activity or the mechanical transport of contaminated dust indoors, the mean environmental half-lives of the pollutants increase by 50 % for outdoor dust reservoirs and over 18 -times for indoor reservoirs. This re-contamination of indoor dusts has implications for decontamination programmes in that attention should be paid to reducing outdoor contamination levels to ensure that attempts to reduce the levels of a pollutant indoors by cleaning are effective...|$|R

Thus, operation of the primary input causes the control unit to yield before the springs, yet, operation of the <b>secondary</b> <b>input,</b> acting directly on the control unit, causes the springs to yield and absorb adjustments before they are transmitted into the primary control system...|$|E

Most adoption studies show that gender-linked differences in the adoption of agricultural technologies are not directly attributable to a farmer being male or female but to differences in access to key requisites such as improved seeds. Female-headed households are likely to lack the resources and networks that allow male-headed households to access the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>inputs</b> that are necessary for the adoption of agricultural technologies. However, some studies, including De Groote et al.

40|$|Abstract — Various {{designs of}} scan paths based on tree-like {{structures}} {{have recently been}} suggested for reducing test application time or test data volume in today’s high density VLSI circuits. However, these techniques strongly rely {{on the existence of}} a large number of compatible sets of flip-flops under the given test set, and therefore, are unsuitable for highly compact test sets generated by efficient ATPG tools. In this paper, to circumvent this problem, a new two-pass hybrid method is proposed to design an efficient scan tree architecture. Given a compact test set, compatibility relationships among the flip-flops are first explored, and a graph-based heuristic algorithm is employed to construct a scan tree with minimal incompatibility. Next, the same combinational ATPG tool is rerun to generate a new test set satisfying the logical constraints on the <b>secondary</b> <b>inputs</b> imposed by the structure of the scan tree. To cover the remaining hard-to-detect faults, if any, a few test vectors are chosen from the original test set for application in the serial mode. Experimental results on various benchmark circuits demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the earlier methods in reducing the total test application time significantly without any degradation of fault coverage...|$|R
