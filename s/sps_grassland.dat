40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} biological and environmental factors on the infection of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) by Echinococcus multilocularis in an endemic area of north-east France. From January 2004 to April 2006, 127 foxes were examined for E. multilocularis and their stomach contents analysed. The effect of year, season, age, sex and urbanisation level on E. multilocularis presence was estimated using a General Linear Model (GLM) with logit link, (i. e. logistic regression). Urbanisation level was the only influencing factor, with a decreasing gradient from rural [54 %, CI 95 % (40 - 68) ] to peri-urban [31 %, CI 95 % (15 - 52) ] and urban area [4 %, CI 95 % (0. 7 - 15) ]. The consumption of Arvicola terrestris and Microtus <b>sp.,</b> <b>grassland</b> species, the main presumed intermediate hosts of E. multilocularis, was studied by the same approach. The two species were consumed less in the urban area and more in autumn than in spring. Anthropogenic food consumption was linked to urbanisation and to age. The frequency of anthropogenic food consumption decreased in the rural area. A global model explaining the presence of E. multilocularis and including urbanisation level and diet was then elaborated. Independently of urbanisation, there was a suggestion of less E. multilocularis infection with anthropogenic food consumption. Red foxes consuming Microtus sp. and A. terrestris had higher worm burden than those that did not. The {{results suggest that the}} decreasing gradient observed from rural to urban area is linked to behaviour and feeding habits...|$|R

40|$|Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) at {{the western}} edge of the Dakotas occur in the {{transition}} zone between sagebrush and grassland communities. These mixed sagebrush (Artemisia <b>sp.)</b> and <b>grasslands</b> differ from those habitats that comprise the central portions of the sage-grouse range; yet, no information is available on winter habitat selection within this region of their distribution. We evaluated factors influencing greater sage-grouse winter habitat use in North Dakota during 2005 – 2006 and 2006 – 2007 and in South Dakota during 2006 – 2007 and 2007 – 2008. We captured and radio-marked 97 breeding-age females and 54 breeding-age males from 2005 to 2007 and quantified habitat selection for 98 of these birds that were alive during winter. We collected habitat measurements at 340 (177 [*]ND, 163 [*]SD) sage-grouse use sites and 680 random (340 each at 250 [*]m and 500 [*]m from locations) dependent sites.

40|$|The {{sustainability}} of continuous cropping systems depends {{heavily on the}} years of intensive agricultural production and the choice of crop sequence that alters the fractions of soil organic matter. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the impact of continuous soybean cultivation on fractions of organic carbon in the vertic Argiudolls of the Argentinean Pampas. Total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), fulvic acids (FA), humic acids (HA), humin (H) and carbon produced by microbial respiration (Cresp) were assessed in plots with continuous production of soybean for over 15 years (<b>SP)</b> and <b>grassland</b> plots that were considered the change control (GP). A significant reduction of TOC and POC variables in cultured soybean SP plots, relative to grassland GP, was observed. The POC / TOC and Cresp / TOC ratios were significantly lower in soybean plots than in grasslands used as controls. These ratios were interpreted as a preferential tendency to maintain high rates of mineralization of labile carbon forms and increased biological stability of humified forms in cultured soybean plots. The shapes of the humic fractions of less complexity, FA and HA, were significantly reduced in the latter plots compared with grasslands, while no significant changes occurred in the more stable and recalcitrant forms of carbon, such as humin, in either plot type...|$|R
40|$|Globally, many {{drylands}} {{are experiencing}} the encroachment of woody vegetation into grasslands. These changes in ecosystem structure and processes {{can result in}} increased sediment and nutrient fluxes due to fluvial erosion. As these changes are often accompanied by a shift from C(4) to C(3) vegetation with characteristic δ(13) C values, stable isotope analysis provides a promising mechanism for tracing these fluxes. Input vegetation, surface sediment and fluvially eroded sediment samples were collected across two contrasting C(4) -C(3) dryland vegetation transitions in New Mexico, USA. Isotope ratio mass spectrometric analyses were performed using a Carlo Erba NA 2000 analyser interfaced to a SerCon 20 - 22 isotope ratio mass spectrometer to determine bulk δ(13) C values. Stable isotope analyses of contemporary input vegetation and surface sediments over the monitored transitions showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) in the bulk δ(13) C values of C(4) Bouteloua <b>sp.</b> (grama) <b>grassland,</b> C(3) Larrea tridentata (creosote) shrubland and C(3) Pinus edulis/Juniperus monosperma (piñon-juniper) woodland sites. Significantly, this distinctive δ(13) C value was maintained in the bulk δ(13) C values of fluvially eroded sediment {{from each of the}} sites, with no significant variation between surface sediment and eroded sediment values. The significant differences in bulk δ(13) C values between sites were dependent on vegetation input. Importantly, these values were robustly expressed in fluvially eroded sediments, suggesting that stable isotope analysis is suitable for tracing sediment fluxes. Due to the prevalent nature of these dryland vegetation transitions in the USA and globally, further development of stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry has provided a valuable tool for enhanced understanding of functional changes in these ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|The stinkbugs of {{the family}} Cydnidae, as Atarsocoris sp., are pests that occurr in many crops, causing {{significant}} losses in areas with high populational rates. They can also be associated with some weed plants. The main goal {{of this research was}} to evaluate the seasonal distribution of Atarsocoris <b>sp.</b> in degraded <b>grasslands</b> during one year. It was verified that the highest levels of nymphs occurred in January and October, which corresponded to the highest humidity rates, due to the rainy period. Adults of Atarsocoris sp. did not show the same tendency. Nevertheless, the highest and the lowest populational levels occurred one month after the highest and the lowest populational levels of nymphs, specially when the big nymphs (4 th and 5 th instar) were considered. Os percevejos da família Cydnidae, entre eles o Atarsocoris sp., são insetos-praga com ocorrência em várias culturas, acarretando perdas significativas em áreas com grande infestação desse inseto; sendo também muito comuns associados à plantas daninhas. Este trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar a distribuição sazonal do percevejo Atarsocoris sp. em áreas de pastagens degradadas durante um ano. Verificou-se maior ocorrência de ninfas nos meses de janeiro e outubro, coincidindo com as épocas de maiores precipitações pluviométricas, como consequência, maior umidade no solo. Com relação aos adultos, não acompanharam essa tendência, embora os maiores e menores números de adultos coletados foram nos meses subsequentes aos com maiores e menores números de ninfas, em especiais as ninfas grandes de 4 º e 5 º ínstar...|$|R
40|$|Differences in soil P among silvopasture, grassland, and arable lands {{have been}} well established. Nevertheless, most of the reports compare soil {{properties}} under long-term sites. Thus, there exists little information {{on the effect of}} the conversion of silvopasture to arable or grassland use on soil P pools. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the impact of converting silvopasture system (SP) into arable cropping and grassland system on the distribution of P pools and potential P bioavailability. We compared the following systems: SP system, SP converted to arable cropland (SP-AL), <b>SP</b> converted to <b>grassland</b> (SP-GL), and for comparative purposes, a long-term arable cropland (AL). The P fractionation was performed by a sequential extraction scheme, using acid and alkaline extractants on samples collected from the 0 ? 10 and 10 ? 20 &# 8201;cm soil layers. It was assumed that the large variations in soil-P fractionations are caused by the different management practices associated with land conversion. The results of P fractionation showed a dominance of calcium-bound P, HCl-extractable Pi constituted up to 36 % of the soil total P (TP). However, the type of land use did not affect this P fraction. On the other hand, the reduction in labile-Pi and NaOH-Pi fractions observed at the SP-AL site may have led to the decline in readily available P. The soil total organic P (TPo) content was 8 % and 17 % lower at SP-AL compared to SP and SP-GL site, respectively. Labile organic-P (labile-Po) content was markedly higher at SP site compared to arable soils, and was &# 8776; 10 % of TPo. The NaOH-Po constituted the highest fraction of the organic-P pool (55 %? 79 % of TPo) across all the study systems, and was positively correlated with TPo (p < 0. 01). The study indicates that conversion of SP system in temperate regions to arable cropping with conventional tillage seems to result in the reduction of P availability compared to SP, indicating SP as an important land-use practice. 201...|$|R
