5|$|About 17.8 percent——of {{the total}} forested area of Vietnam was <b>sprayed</b> during the war, which {{disrupted}} the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover, {{and loss of}} seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas. Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as bamboo and cogon grass), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal-species diversity was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and five species of mammals in a <b>sprayed</b> forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals.|$|E

The effects of the <b>spray</b> tip penetration, <b>spray</b> volume, entrainment mass and air-fuel ratio were discussed on the <b>sprays</b> of before and after impingement. The volume of the post-impingement <b>spray</b> was calculated using axi-symmetrical model. It was greatly affected by {{the distance between the}} injection nozzle and the wall. When the impingement distance was shorter than the break-up length of the original <b>spray,</b> the entrainment mass as well as the volume of post-impingement <b>spray</b> was the larger than that of the original <b>spray</b> at the same inspection time. To calculate the average <b>spray</b> concentration of after impingement <b>spray,</b> the fuel film stuck on the wall was measured.

40|$|Traditional {{sprayers}} adopt large-area uniform pesticide application, {{resulting in}} a low effective utilisation of pesticide and a harmful effect to the natural environment. Variable-rate <b>spray</b> is the key point to precision chemical application. However, {{it is inevitable that}} the <b>spray</b> pressure sharply fluctuates during variable-rate <b>spray,</b> which will definitely influence the <b>spray</b> characteristics, such as <b>spray</b> droplet sizes, <b>spray</b> angles, <b>spray</b> droplet velocities, etc., and reduce the efficiency of pesticide applications. Therefore, the research on how to keep the <b>spray</b> pressure constant during the process of variable- rate <b>spray</b> has practical significance to precision pesticide applications. In order to achieve the stability of <b>spray</b> pressure for variable- rate <b>spray,</b> a sprayer with constant-pressure control was set up using a closed-loop proportion integration differentiation (PID) controller of constant-pressure water-supply, which employed the techniques of single-phase alternating current (AC) chopper variablevoltage control and PID feedback regulation. Using hollow-cone nozzles, the <b>spray</b> volume was changed by adjusting <b>spray</b> pressure, frequency, and duty cycle of electromagnetic valve switching. The <b>spray</b> features concerning the <b>spray</b> angle and the <b>spray</b> volume distribution were studied in laboratory. The conclusions are as follows: i) for a given input <b>spray</b> pressure, the closed-loop controller with AC chopper and PID feedback regulation can effectively control the pressure fluctuations during the variable-rate <b>spray</b> through varying the frequency and the duty cycle; ii) the <b>spray</b> angle was slightly affected by the flow-rate change through adjusting the frequency and the duty cycle of electromagnetic valves or changing the number of open nozzles. The <b>spray</b> angle changes were controlled within the range of the maximum deviation 0. 87 ° from mean value and the minimum deviation 0. 03 ° from mean value; iii) when the <b>spray</b> pressure was set as 0. 3 Mpa, the peak radial position of the <b>spray</b> volume distribution basically unchanged and the <b>spray</b> volume and the peak values of the <b>spray</b> distribution gradually increased with the increasing duty cycle.

The characteristic data was extracted from <b>spray</b> images grabbed by a high speed visualization system. The results showed that the ambient pressure and injection pressure had significant effects on the <b>spray</b> characteristics. As the ambient pressure increased, the <b>spray</b> angle increased, while the <b>spray</b> tip penetration and the peak of average tip velocity decreased. As the injection pressure increased, the <b>spray</b> tip penetration, <b>spray</b> angle, <b>spray</b> area and <b>spray</b> volume increased. The increasing blend ratio of biodiesel brought about a shorter <b>spray</b> tip penetration and a smaller <b>spray</b> angle compared with those of diesel.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Improved <b>spray</b> {{deposition}} can {{be attained}} by electrostatically charging <b>spray</b> droplets, {{which increases the}} attraction of droplets to plants and decreases operator exposure to pesticide and losses to the environment. However, this technique alone {{is not sufficient to}} achieve desirable penetration of the <b>spray</b> solution into the crop canopy; thus, air assistance can be added to the electrostatic <b>spraying</b> to further improve <b>spray</b> deposition. This study was conducted to compare different <b>spraying</b> technologies on <b>spray</b> deposition and two-spotted spider mite control in cut chrysanthemum.
