5|$|The humor {{magazine}} National Lampoon hired Jean and Reiss {{after they}} graduated in 1981. During the 1980s, the duo began collaborating on various television material. During this period they worked as writers and producers on television {{shows such as}} The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, ALF, <b>Sledge</b> <b>Hammer!</b> and It's Garry Shandling's Show. In 1989, Jean was offered {{a job as a}} writer on the animated sitcom The Simpsons, a show created by Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, and Sam Simon that continues to air today. Many of Jean's friends were not interested in working on The Simpsons because it was a cartoon and they did not think it would last long. Jean, however, was a fan of the work of Groening, Brooks, and Simon, and therefore took the job together with Reiss.|$|E
5|$|In other media, the {{television}} series <b>Sledge</b> <b>Hammer!</b> (1986–88) lampoons noir, along with {{such topics as}} capital punishment, gun fetishism, and Dirty Harry. Sesame Street (1969–curr.) occasionally casts Kermit the Frog as a private eye; the sketches refer {{to some of the}} typical motifs of noir films, in particular the voiceover. Garrison Keillor's radio program A Prairie Home Companion features the recurring character Guy Noir, a hardboiled detective whose adventures always wander into farce (Guy also appears in the Altman-directed film based on Keillor's show). Firesign Theatre's Nick Danger has trod the same not-so-mean streets, both on radio and in comedy albums. Cartoons such as Garfield's Babes and Bullets (1989) and comic strip characters such as Tracer Bullet of Calvin and Hobbes have parodied both film noir and the kindred hardboiled tradition—one of the sources from which film noir sprang and which it now overshadows.|$|E
25|$|With the {{upsurge in}} Australia of the {{restoration}} of so-called 'Heritage items', the techniques of Australian bush carpentry may be moving closer to formal identification and categorization.

The South African School of Mine's motto {{was the same as}} the university's current one, and surrounded the shield.|$|E

25|$|Outside of {{professional}} wrestling, Ferraro is a real-life performing strongman. His demonstrations have included bending steel bars and breaking iron bars over his head, and headbutting and snapping a Louisville slugger in half with his skull. His specialty, however, is using {{his head to}} break various hard or heavy objects. He has had cinder blocks jack-hammered off his head, concrete blocks set on fire and broken {{over the side of}} his head using a <b>sledge</b> <b>hammer,</b> and having 16lb bowling balls dropped on his head from heights up to 15 feet. Ferraro has also used his forehead to drive spikes through 2x4s wrapped in sheet metal. Ferraro first discovered this ability as a teenager when, while chasing younger brother around the house during an argument, crashed head first into a large oak door.|$|E
500|$|In 1916 Lewis {{left school}} {{to take a}} job at a {{locomotive}} factory, swinging a <b>sledge</b> <b>hammer</b> for four dollars a week. Although only five feet six inches tall, he weighed 195 pounds with an 18-inch neck, and feet that fit into size-five-and-one-half shoes. Sportswriter Shirley Povich later observed that he was [...] "built along the lines of a beer keg, and was not wholly unfamiliar with its contents." [...] While his unusual physique was considered an oddity at the time, his large head, tiny feet, short legs and broad, flat face are now recognized as hallmarks of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.|$|E

In front of the boulder lie two crossed hunting rifles and a Phrygian cap (or [...] "Cap of Liberty") to illustrate the importance of the state's fight for liberty. Two men, a farmer and a miner, stand on either side of the boulder and represent agriculture and industry. The farmer stands on the left with an ax and plow before a cornstalk.

500|$|In February 1843 the Second Report of the Children's Employment Commission was published. It was a {{parliamentary}} report exposing {{the effects of}} the Industrial Revolution upon working class children. Horrified by what he read, Dickens planned to publish an inexpensive political pamphlet tentatively titled, An Appeal to the People of England, on behalf of the Poor Man's Child, but changed his mind, deferring the pamphlet's production {{until the end of the}} year. In March he wrote to Dr. Southwood Smith, one of the four commissioners responsible for the Second Report, about his change in plans: [...] "you will certainly feel that a <b>Sledge</b> <b>hammer</b> has come down with twenty times the force—twenty thousand times the force—I could exert by following out my first idea".|$|E
500|$|ABC {{canceled}} Our World {{after its}} first season, {{replacing it with}} the situation comedies <b>Sledge</b> <b>Hammer!</b> and The Charmings. Ellerbee and Gandolf learned that the show had been canceled from a segment on Entertainment Tonight. Ellerbee sharply criticized ABC for the cancellation, saying [...] "If they had left it there {{for three to four}} years, it could have done what 60 Minutes did, which went against the Disney juggernaut on NBC. It could have developed slowly as an alternative program without being in the ratings race." [...] The advocacy group Viewers for Quality Television mounted a letter-writing campaign to save the show – similar to campaigns that had saved Designing Women and Cagney and Lacey – and generated some 20,000 letters of support, [...] but the campaign was unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|The {{extensive}} flooding stranded {{many residents}} who {{were forced to}} stay in place long after Hurricane Katrina had passed. Stranded survivors dotted the tops of houses citywide. Some were trapped inside attics and were unable to escape. Many people chopped their way onto their roofs with hatchets and <b>sledge</b> <b>hammers,</b> which Mayor Nagin had residents urged to store in their attics in case of such events. Clean water was unavailable, and power outages were expected to last for weeks.|$|R
60|$|This was {{followed}} by the thundering noise of a score of <b>sledge</b> <b>hammers</b> at the principal entrance and the side doors. Mr. Cartwright and one of his workmen ran to the bell rope, and in a moment its iron tongue was clanging out its summons for assistance to the country round. A roar of fury broke from the Luddites; many of them fired at the bell in hopes of cutting the rope, and the men plied their hammers more furiously than before. But the doors were tremendously strong and were backed with plates of iron.|$|R

25|$|The {{most famous}} modern {{metalwork}} {{of the state}} is the hammered copper of Santa Clara del Cobre, founded in 1530 as a smelter for the nuns of the order of Saint Claire. The foundry is gone but the work in the metal continues, with the making of copper tubs, vats, ladles, trays, sinks, basins, kegs, vases, pots, plates, jars, jewelry and more. Nearly all the copper used is from recycled materials. All are made by hand, using only hand tools such as mallets, <b>hammers,</b> <b>sledge</b> <b>hammers,</b> anvils and chisels, which work metal heated in wood fired furnaces.

50|$|The {{significance}} of Ogham stones {{would not have}} been fully understood in olden times. Many of these Ogham stones throughout Ireland were used as building stones, gate posts and even broken up to facilitate ease of transport for building or road filling. Two such examples are the Ogham stones at nearby Tullaherin which was used as a gate post and the Dunbell Ogham stones which were found during excavation of a group of six raths between 1852 and 1855. These Ogham stones were broken with <b>sledge</b> <b>hammers</b> by workmen to facilitate removal. It is fortunate that the Gowran Ogham Stone survived to the present day.|$|R

50|$|Between Chapeltown and Egerton are {{the remains}} of prehistoric stone circles on moorland at Cheetham Close which {{date back to the}} Bronze Age. These stone circles are the {{earliest}} evidence for settlers in the Turton area. One of the circles was 15 metres (51 ft) in diameter and some of the stones were several feet in height. In the 19th century there were many uninvited visitors to the site which caused the local farmer, a tenant of Turton Tower, to break it up in 1871 using his team of carthorses and <b>sledge</b> <b>hammers.</b> Before this happened, antiquarian, Gilbert French, had made sketches, maps and plans and written a detailed description which is now in Bolton Reference Library.|$|R

Brown refused, saying, [...] "No, I prefer to die here." [...] Stuart then gave a signal. The Marines used <b>sledge</b> <b>hammers</b> and a makeshift battering-ram to break down the engine room door.
