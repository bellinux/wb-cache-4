5|$|Decline in age, size during sexual {{maturity}} in {{great northern tilefish}} population is occurring throughout the continental shelf. In the mid-Atlantic Bight, smaller sizes and younger ages at maturity were observed in 2008, compared to the <b>survey</b> <b>data</b> from the 1980s where recorded measurements showed a larger population. The recent estimates of age and size at maturity in the southern U.S. waters were smaller than those previously reported in the late 1980s. There were also very few juvenile tilefish seen in tilefish population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Declines in population could negatively affect other organisms in their surrounding environment {{due to the fact}} that without tilefish, the burrows underneath the continental shelf will disappear, therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with other organisms that use the tunnels as shelter.|$|E

With 1, 200 <b>surveyed</b> <b>data,</b> the results show that 91. 1 % of the taxi riders are men and also the earning cost is obtained of ~ 500 - 600 Bath/day. Moreover, 85. 1 % of the SP <b>surveyed</b> <b>data</b> shows that the riders do not need to use the electric motorcycle as a taxi. It causes to high price, vehicle speed, lifetime, compatible for electricity charging and also duration to charge.
