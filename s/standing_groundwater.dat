40|$|THESIS 8989 This thesis {{investigates the}} degree of karstification and the {{characteristics}} of groundwater - surface water interactions in the Meath-Westmeath Lakeland region. In particular, groundwater - lake interactions {{in the region are}} examined. The methodological framework adopted in the study involved conducting an initial pilot study over an area of 215 km 2 situated in the Meath-Westmeath Lakeland region. More specifically, this area comprised of the lake catchments of Lough Owel, Lough Derravaragh, Lough Lene, White Lake, the Ben Loughs, and Lough Bane, and the spring catchments of Tobernacogany and Toberfaolaigh. Following from this initial pilot study, a smaller study area was selected which was representative of the region, and which was suitable for the implementation of the methodological framework employed in the detailed study. The pilot study comprised of a desk study and a surface water data collection programme. On the basis of results obtained during the pilot study, the catchments of Lough Owel and Lough Derravaragh were omitted from further study. The detailed study was then carried out over an area of approximately 33 km 2 that had been selected from the initial pilot study area. The detailed study involved the collection of both groundwater and surface water data and the methods adopted included: <b>groundwater</b> <b>standing</b> water level measurement; stream flow measurement; water quality measurements; water tracing; drainage density calculation; and the calculation of water budgets...|$|R
50|$|Contamination of air {{and soil}} due to {{atmospheric}} testing {{is only part of}} a wider issue. Water contamination due to improper disposal of spent uranium and decay of sunken nuclear-powered submarines is a major problem in the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia. Although the Russian government states that the radioactive power cores are stable, various scientists have come forth with serious concerns about the 32,000 spent nuclear fuel elements that remain in the sunken vessels. There have been no major incidents other than the explosion and sinking of a nuclear-powered submarine in August 2000, but many international scientists are still uneasy at the prospect of the hulls eroding, releasing uranium into the sea and causing considerable contamination. Although the submarines pose an environmental risk, they have yet to cause serious harm to public health. However, water contamination {{in the area of the}} Mayak test site, especially at Lake Karachay, is extreme, and has gotten to the point where radioactive byproducts have found their way into drinking water supplies. It has been an area of concern since the early 1950s, when the Soviets began disposing of tens of millions of cubic meters of radioactive waste by pumping it into the small lake. Half a century later, in the 1990s, there are still hundreds of millions of curies of waste in the Lake, and at points contamination has been so severe that a mere half-hour of exposure to certain regions would deliver a dose of radiation sufficient to kill 50% of humans. Although the area immediately surrounding the lake is devoid of population, the lake has the potential to dry up in times of drought. Most significantly, in 1967, it dried up and winds carried radioactive dust over thousands of square kilometers, exposing at least 500,000 citizens to a range of health risks. To control dust, Soviet scientists piled concrete on top of the lake. Although this was effective in helping mediate the amount of dust, the weight of the concrete pushed radioactive materials into closer contact with <b>standing</b> underground <b>groundwater.</b> It is difficult to gauge the overall health and environmental effects of the water contamination at Lake Karachay because figures on civilian exposure are unavailable, making it hard to show causation between elevated cancer rates and radioactive pollution specifically from the lake.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the different headspace equilibration methods for the quantification of dissolved greenhouse gases in groundwater. Groundwater samples were collected from wells with contrasting hydrogeochemical properties and degassed using the headspace equilibration method. One hundred samples from each well were randomly selected, treatments were applied and headspace gases analysed by gas chromatography. Headspace equilibration treatments varied helium (He) :water ratio, shaking time and <b>standing</b> time. Mean <b>groundwater</b> N 2 O, CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations were 0. 024 mg N L− 1, 13. 71 mg C L− 1 and 1. 63 μg C L− 1, respectively. All treatments were found to significantly influence dissolved gas concentrations. Considerable differences in the optimal He:water ratio and standing time were observed between the three gases. For N 2 O, CO 2 and CH 4 the optimum operating points for He:water ratio was 4. 4 : 1, 3 : 1 and 3. 4 : 1; shaking time was 13, 12 and 13 min; and standing time was 63, 17 and 108 min, respectively. The headspace equilibration method needs to be harmonised to ensure comparability between studies. The experiment reveals that He:water ratio 3 : 1 and shaking time 13 min give better estimation of dissolved gases than any lower or higher ratios and shaking times. The standing time 63, 17 and 108 min should be applied for N 2 O, CO 2 and CH 4, respectively. peer-reviewedDepartment of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, Ireland - Research Stimulus Fund Programme (Grant RSF 06383); Department of Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering, Trinity College Dubli...|$|R

Among them a landslide occurred in Dangjiacha area of Xiji County, Ningxia (termed as Dangjiacha landslide in this paper) was investigated in detail. This landslide originated on a slope of about 20 degrees, and the displaced soil mass from the source area traveled about 3200 m, damming a valley. Field survey revealed that <b>standing</b> <b>groundwater</b> exists within the landslide on the source area, and the loess on the source area was in great void ratio. Therefore, {{it is reasonable to}} infer that liquefaction failure within the water-saturated loess layer was the main reason for this long-travel landslide, rather than the assumption that these earthquake-triggered rapid landslides were due to the suspension of silt in air. To examine this assumption, ring shear tests were performed on the samples taken from the source area of Dangjiacha landslide. Undrained ring shear tests on the water-saturated loess soils applied to monotonic/cyclic shearing showed that the loess soil is highly liquefiable, and shear failure can be triggered during cyclic loading. In additional, undrained ring shear tests had also been performed on the dry sample “saturated ” by air to examine whether landslide with high mobility can be triggered or not, with the involving of air. The results revealed that the increase of pore-air pressure with increase of shear displacement was small such that n...|$|E
40|$|Historical {{drainage}} improvements {{have created}} complex hydrological regimes in many low-lying, wet coastal grassland areas. The manipulation of ditch water levels {{is a common}} management technique to maintain important in-stream and in-field habitats in such areas. However, in wet grasslands with low soil conductivities the water table in the centre of each field is not closely coupled to variations in ditch stage. Consequently rainfall and evaporation have a greater influence on the depth to water table and water table fluctuations within each field. In-field microtopographic variations also lead to subtle variations in the hydrological regime and depth to water table that create a mosaic of different wetness conditions and habitats. The depth, duration, timing and frequency of flooding from accumulated rainfall, surface water and <b>standing</b> <b>groundwater</b> also influence the availability of suitable in-field habitats.

40|$|Nature of {{the problem}} * Freshwater {{ecosystems}} {{play a key role}} in the European nitrogen (N) cycle, both as a reactive agent that transfers, stores and processes N loadings from the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems, and as a natural environment severely impacted by the increase of these loadings. Approaches * This chapter is a review of major processes and factors controlling N transport and transformations for running waters, <b>standing</b> waters, <b>groundwaters</b> and riparian wetlands. Key findings/state of knowledge * The major factor controlling N processes in freshwater ecosystems is the residence time of water, which varies widely both in space and in time, and which is sensitive to changes in climate, land use and management. * The effects of increased N loadings to European freshwaters include acidifi cation in semi-natural environments, and eutrophication in more disturbed ecosystems, with associated loss of biodiversity in both cases. * An important part of the nitrogen transferred by surface waters is in the form of organic N, as dissolved organic N (DON) and particulate organic N (PON). Th is part is dominant in semi-natural catchments throughout Europe and remains a signifi cant component of the total N load even in nitrate enriched rivers. * In eutrophicated standing freshwaters N can be a factor limiting or co-limiting biological production, and control of both N and phosphorus (P) loading is oft en needed in impacted areas, if ecological quality is to be restored. Major uncertainties/challenges * The importance of storage and denitrifi cation in aquifers is a major uncertainty in the global N cycle, and controls in part the response of catchments to land use or management changes. In some aquifers, the increase of N concentrations will continue for decades even if efficient mitigation measures are implemented now. * Nitrate retention by riparian wetlands has oft en been highlighted. However, their use for mitigation must be treated with caution, since their effectiveness is difficult to predict, and side eff ects include increased DON emissions to adjacent open waters, N 2 O emissions to the atmosphere, and loss of biodiversity. * In fact, the character and specifi c spatial origins of DON are not fully understood, and similarly the quantitative importance of indirect N 2 O emissions from freshwater ecosystems as a result of N leaching losses from agricultural soils is still poorly known at the regional scale. * These major uncertainties remain due to the lack of adequate monitoring (all forms of N at a relevant frequency), especially - but not only - in the southern and eastern EU countries. Recommendations * The great variability of transfer pathways, buffering capacity and sensitivity of the catchments and of the freshwater ecosystems calls for site specific mitigation measures rather than standard ones applied at regional to national scale. * The spatial and temporal variations of the N forms, the processes controlling the transport and transformation of N within freshwaters, require further investigation if the role of N in infl uencing freshwater ecosystem health is to be better understood, underpinning the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive for European freshwaters...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrogeology}} of the Macquarie Catchment {{has been}} studied extensively in the past 20 years, {{but there are still}} many gaps in our understanding of the groundwater systems and river-aquifer interactions. These gaps in our knowledge limit our capacity to manage water resources throughout the catchment. This document captures our current understanding of the hydrogeology of the catchment and provides a multidimensional spatial analysis of the <b>groundwater</b> <b>standing</b> water level data. Based on the finding recommendations for further research are then presented. Abstraction of groundwater for the purposes of irrigating cotton and other crops started in the Macquarie Catchment in 1967, and expanded until the turn of the century. To monitor the impact of groundwater usage NSW State water management departments installed monitoring bores in the zones with significant groundwater usage. The groundwater monitoring data are publicly available on the Pinneena Groundwater Monitoring CD. This report presents all the hydrographs for the Macquarie Catchment, and examines the spatial and temporal trends displayed in these data. The primary goal of this project was to provide a graph of all the groundwater hydrographs in the catchment. A printout of every hydrograph within the Macquarie catchment is presented in the Appendix. Through the implementation of water sharing plans there have been changes to groundwater allocations. At some locations there has been a reduction in the water allocated per share, with the aim of improving the long term viability of the groundwater resource for all users and the environment. The groundwater hydrographs provide a record of baseline conditions and can be used {{to assess the impact of}} variations in allocation and guide future management decisions. Almost 40 years of groundwater hydrograph records enable long term groundwater level trends to be analysed throughout the alluvial regions of the catchment. Groundwater head change over long and short periods of time are analysed using traditional hydrograph plots and 3 D plots to show the yearly and interdecadal impacts of groundwater extractions. The groundwater hydrograph data are interpreted in the context of existing geological knowledge, streamflow, rainfall and groundwater usage data. Within the Macquarie Catchment a unique balanced needs to be achieved in the way water is managed if urban centres and farms dependent on the water are to prosper, while maintaining important wetlands at the end of the catchment. The Macquarie River flows northwest from the head waters on the western side of the Great Dividing Range just south of Bathurst, to join the Barwon River west of Brewarrina. The southern portion of the Macquarie River is highly regulated by Burrendong and Windamere Dams and by a series of weirs, bypass canals and irrigation channels that assist the diversion and abstraction of water for irrigation, industrial and domestic purposes. The major irrigation district is north of Narromine and south of the Macquarie Marshes on the fertile soils of the floodplain. This flood plain overlies up to 150 m of valley-fill sediments which lie within the Macquarie River palaeovalley. It is the fresh groundwater within these sediments that is used for irrigation. The Macquarie Marshes just north of the irrigation district are a large and diverse system of semi-permanent freshwater wetlands created by irregular flooding of the flat lands adjacent to the river and are an important ecological habitat. This study identifies zones along the river where aquifers within the sediments that fill the deep palaeovalley are locally hydraulically connected to the river, and zones where the deep aquifers are disconnected from the shallow aquifers and do not receive direct river recharge. The largest zone of aquifer depletion is west of Narromine. This zone requires further extensive hydrogeological and water chemistry investigations to better understand the recharge pathways. If the management goal is to reduce the decline in the groundwater head, then this region may require managed aquifer recharge. North and west of Narromine there are zones of local rising watertable in the upper unconfined aquifer due to irrigation recharge (deep drainage). Further research is required to determine if this will result in future soil and water quality problems. Based on these findings it is suggested that a detailed 3 D lithofacies model needs to be constructed for the Lower Macquarie Catchment. This 3 D model could then guide the construction of a coupled surface and sub-surface flow model. Also required is an extensive groundwater chemical investigation (with a focus on dating the ages of the groundwater zones) and coupled river and aquifer flow modelling, linked to the water chemistry investigations. The results of these investigations should help to better inform water management decisions...|$|R

40|$|This project {{demonstrates}} {{an approach}} for coordinating hydrogeological data {{to improve the}} management of water in a catchment. Developed for this project {{are a series of}} Mathematica applications that help with the improved visualisation and interpretation of catchment water data, in particular advancing the way we spatially analyse standing water level information and driller logs. The new visual methods help with conceptualising the catchment hydrogeology, and guide the construction of catchment water balance models. Data available from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), Geoscience Australia (GA), various state water departments, Catchment Management Authorities and new data collected as part of this project have been coordinated into two databases; one for continuous data, point information and bore details, and a GIS database for all 2 D information. Information is extracted from the databases for examining trends in borehole and stream hydrographs, generating 2 D and 3 D graphical representations of the data and trends, and for constructing a 3 D geological conceptual model of a catchment. These 3 D models and hydrograph data are then passed to any surface water and groundwater modelling environment. FEFLOW was used for this project. The NSW State Government distributes historic water information on the “Historic data CD Pinneena for Groundwater Works”. Mathematica notebooks have been written to provide a graphical representation of the data. Detailed in the notebooks are methods for plotting individual bore hydrographs, automatically plotting all hydrographs within a geographical area, performing time-series analysis, examining the correlation between two hydrographs (for example, a post processing FEFLOW model output, comparing the modelled versus the measured groundwater hydrograph), plotting in 3 D the change in the recovered <b>standing</b> <b>groundwater</b> level for all monitoring points in a catchment, examining in 3 D the impact of groundwater extraction in any pumping season, and plotting an interpretation of the driller log descriptions in 3 D (a facies model of the unconsolidated sedimentary valley-fill). A major outcome of this project has been {{the development of a new}} approach for constructing 3 D geological models of catchments. New scripts have been written in the Mathematica scripting language that enables the construction of 3 D geological structural and property models. The structural model provides the boundary surfaces for the groundwater flow model (the ground surface and the palaeovalley surface) and the property model provides the permeability distribution for the groundwater flow model. The 3 D geological models can be used to determine the volume between any surfaces, or to present the most likely lithology to be encountered when drilling a new bore. The Mathematica notebooks will be marketed under the name Crystallize. The Crystallize notebooks take advantage of the extensive library of functions in Mathematica and add new algorithms needed for hydrogeological investigation. Mathematica notebooks are interactive documents. Each notebook consists of text, links to databases, algorithms, plots, 2 D and 3 D graphics. Pages in the notebook look like normal text. The scripts that form part of the document can be run from within the document, and the plots and 3 D graphics that are generated in the document can be manipulated and edited within the notebook. All 3 D objects within the documents can be rotated, allowing the 3 D geological models to be viewed from any position in space. Consolidating the base hydrogeological data into MS Access and ArcGIS is a well documented standard practice. However, there is still much development required on how to construct 3 D geological conceptual site models, and how to transfer the detail captured in the high resolution 3 D geological model into the relatively coarse scale coupled surface water and groundwater flow models. Worldwide there are no standardised approaches on how to construct a 3 D geological framework for coupled surface and sub-surface water flow modelling. There are many new 3 D geological and water balance modelling environments available, evolving and emerging. An advantage of the approach presented in this project is that the Crystallize notebooks can be easily modified or new scripts added by any individual. FEFLOW is one promising application for examining aspects of the catchment water balance. This project explored the capacity of FEFLOW for evaluating the catchment water balance. The adopted approach incorporated more hydrogeological complexity and details about plant water use than many models presently used throughout the Murray-Darling Basin. A goal of this project was to have more layers in the FEFLOW model to capture the facies variability in the unconsolidated sediments (ideally a layer for the typical thickness of the lithological layers, in the order of 5 m within the Maules Creek Catchment). This is important for the objective of modelling the migration pathway of groundwater where there is substantial variability in the water chemistry. However, if FEFLOW calculations within the order of hours are required then the aquifer geometry needs to be simplified. The final FEFLOW model had layers set to represent the deep drainage surface, a vertosol layer, and then approximately every 20 m throughout the deepest portion of the aquifer system. Further research is required about how to best represent an aquifer in a groundwater model for fast calculations. More hydrogeological complexity could be incorporated into future models by either using a more powerful computer than used for this project or by allowing the calculations to run for a day or more. The data analysis methodologies developed as part of this project have already been used in student projects at The University of New South Wales (UNSW), for Cotton Catchment Communities CRC projects, and by the Water Research Laboratory (WRL) at the University of New South Wales for baseline assessment of groundwater conditions for the Namoi Catchment Management Authority. The methods developed as part of this project make 3 D geological modelling and hydrograph analysis accessible to all government agencies, contractors, and research institutions. In particular, students now have access to 3 D geological modelling and hydrograph analysis software that they can use at home and throughout their careers in groundwater management. This project has considerably advanced our conceptualisation of river and aquifer connectivity in the Maules Creek region and demonstrated the impact of the groundwater irrigation extractions. Presentations of the results at cotton industry forums and trade shows and at community meetings have all been well received, often giving irrigators a new understanding of surface water and groundwater processes...|$|E
