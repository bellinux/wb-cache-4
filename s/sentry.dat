25|$|The <b>sentries</b> {{are posted}} daily from 9a.m. to 5p.m. EDT, every {{hour on the}} hour. At 9a.m. the posting {{corporal}} – generally a corporal from the junior leadership but sometimes a corporal from the ranks – marches out accompanied by the four <b>sentries,</b> two escorts, and a bagpiper. The corporal, <b>sentries,</b> and escorts are all dressed in full scarlet uniforms and carry rifles with bayonets fixed. The party marches to the Sussex Drive gate of Rideau Hall where the first two <b>sentries</b> are posted and have their duties read to them. The party then marches back to Rideau Hall itself where the two remaining <b>sentries</b> are posted and have their duties read. It {{should also be noted}} that the <b>sentries</b> may change more often due to weather issues; e.g. on an extremely hot day.|$|R

5|$|Structure 66 {{is located}} on Terrace9, at the {{northern}} extreme of the North Group. It had an excellent view across the entire city and may {{have served as a}} <b>sentry</b> post controlling access to the site. It dates from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic.|$|E
5|$|The French assault {{began at}} the same time, but they were halted by the abatis, which was {{undamaged}} by the artillery fire. The French began to hack at the abatis and a Hessian <b>sentry</b> came out and asked who was there. When there was no response, the <b>sentry</b> opened fire as did other Hessians on the parapet. The French soldiers fired back, and then charged the redoubt. The Germans charged the Frenchmen climbing over the walls but the French fired a volley, driving them back. The Hessians then took a defensive position behind some barrels but threw down their arms and surrendered when the French prepared a bayonet charge.|$|E
5|$|The Manzanar Committee's efforts {{resulted}} in the State of California naming Manzanar as California Historical Landmark #850 in 1972, with an historical marker being placed at the <b>sentry</b> post on April 14, 1973.|$|E

25|$|With two others, Captain Haldane and Sergeant Brockie, Churchill {{devised a}} plan. The {{building}} {{where they were}} held {{was surrounded by a}} patrolled courtyard, and then a wall. The <b>sentries</b> moved about, and the conspirators determined that at a certain point the <b>sentries</b> would be briefly unable to see part of the wall, and a fit man would be able to climb it. On the first night they resolved to try to escape, the <b>sentries</b> changed their patrol pattern and escape was impossible. On the second an opportunity arose where two <b>sentries</b> stopped to talk to each other, and Churchill scaled the wall.|$|R

5|$|By contrast, of 393 men {{sentenced to}} death for falling asleep on <b>sentry</b> duty in all theatres in World War I, only two were {{executed}} (sentries were usually posted in pairs to keep one another awake; these two, who served in Mesopotamia, were made an example of because they were found sitting asleep together, suggesting that they had colluded).|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 1983, a U.S. Air Force E-3 <b>Sentry</b> {{collided}} with a KC-135A Tanker aircraft over Saudi Arabia during Operation ELF-1. Both aircraft were recovered back to Riyadh Air Base. The Tanker received substantial damage, with parts impact and loss of pressure, as well as shut down of the two starboard engines. The E-3 received severe damage with the partial loss of a left wing section.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} embarked from Wellington in October 1914 for Egypt, {{and upon}} arrival, was primarily engaged in training {{before it was}} deployed along the Suez Canal late in January 1915 to support Indian troops stationed to guard against a rumoured Turkish attack. Three weeks of <b>sentry</b> duty ensued for the battalion before it returned to Cairo.|$|E
50|$|For days afterwards, the southerners would taunt the {{northern}} <b>sentries,</b> thanking them {{for all the}} food and inviting them over for dinner. There was so much beef available that Confederate <b>sentries</b> would sometimes offer it in unauthorized trades with Union <b>sentries</b> for certain luxury items of which the Federal soldiers had a plentiful supply, but the Confederates lacked. After the beef was eaten or spoiled, the Confederates reverted to their previous, dire food situation.|$|R

50|$|The {{rotation}} of the Sentinel and the <b>Sentries</b> is slow and predictable. However, if there are many <b>Sentries,</b> there will be few safe locations anywhere on the landscape. If either the Sentinel or the <b>Sentries</b> come across a source of energy (boulders or a synthoid), their rotation stops while they absorb the energy, one unit at a time. Meanwhile, to keep the total energy of the landscape constant, a tree is created randomly on the landscape for each absorbed unit of energy.|$|R
5|$|The series {{contained}} a three-part backup story featuring Hybrid. He is {{captured by the}} Jury, now {{under the command of}} Orwell's son Maxwell and dealing with criminals through the legal process. Washington and his symbiote are put on trial as criminals. The Jury's guards include many of Hybrid's former co-workers, including <b>Sentry.</b> The New Warriors try to free Hybrid, who is ultimately released.|$|E
5|$|Venom: Lethal Protector {{initiated}} the character's transition from unambiguous villain to anti-hero, and introduced several new characters (including Venom's symbiote offspring Scream, Phage, Riot, Lasher and Agony, who would recur in Marvel comics until the 2011 Carnage, U.S.A. limited series, vigilante group The Jury, its creator General Orwell Taylor, the <b>Sentry,</b> Bomblast, Ramshot, Screech and Firearm).|$|E
5|$|A second {{access to}} the castle leads up from a rocky cove, the {{aperture}} to a marine cave on the northern side of the Dunnottar cliffs into which a small boat could be brought. From here a steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff top, which in turn offers {{access to the}} castle via the Water Gate in the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of earthworks, surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward. A small <b>sentry</b> box or guard house stands by the eastern battery, overlooking the coast.|$|E
5000|$|They first {{encountered}} American <b>sentries</b> at Davis’ tavern at Big Creek (now Red Hill Creek), who fired their muskets and dispersed. They encountered more <b>sentries</b> along the way, {{in the woods}} and near a church. Billy dispatched one of the <b>sentries</b> with his sword, while giving him the countersign. As they snuck up to the American camp they saw fires set by the American troops, {{on the other side of}} a lane. Billy was present at the battle but was not injured.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Sentry's</b> most {{recently}} completed tour was the Run tour, which ran from 20 February to 21 March 2015 {{to celebrate the}} lead single from his second album Strange New Past, [...] "Run". <b>Sentry's</b> Strange New Past tour began on 11 June and is to conclude on 28 August 2015.|$|R
5|$|After {{the camp}} was closed, the site {{eventually}} returned to its original state. Within a couple of years, all the structures had been removed, {{with the exception of}} the two <b>sentry</b> posts at the entrance, the cemetery monument, and the former Manzanar High School auditorium, which was purchased by the County of Inyo. The County leased the auditorium to the Independence Veterans of Foreign Wars, who used it as a meeting facility and community theater until 1951. After that, the building was used as a maintenance facility by the Inyo County Road Department.|$|E
5|$|At 01:00 on 25 April the British ships {{stopped at}} sea, and thirty-six rowing boats towed by twelve steamers {{embarked}} {{the first six}} companies, two each from the 9th, 10th and 11th Battalions. At 02:00 a Turkish <b>sentry</b> reported seeing ships moving at sea, and at 02:30 the report was sent to 9th Division's headquarters. At 02:53 the ships headed towards the peninsula, continuing until 03:30 when the larger ships stopped. With 50 yards (46m) to go, the rowing boats continued using only their oars.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1812, maps of the {{peninsula}} showed a marked increase in buildings: a two-story common prison, a small hospital, officers' quarters, a gunner's house, a turnkey store, fuel sheds, the agent's office and guard house, a bell house, nine <b>sentry</b> boxes, and four oceanside outhouses. Despite this, the facility was severely overcrowded, a problem compounded by attempts at segregating the remaining French prisoners and the few African-Americans from the majority white American population. 2078 prisoners were recorded {{by the end of}} 1812, including 1412 privateers and 572 merchant seamen. More than 3000 arrived over the next two years, including nearly 1000 soldiers captured in the Niagara area.|$|E
5000|$|After {{posting a}} number of songs on Triple J's Unearthed website, he was {{selected}} by Steph Hughes, host of the station's Home & Hosed programme, as a [...] "Featured Artist". <b>Sentry's</b> contribution became the most downloaded track on the website. He followed with a 31-date national tour supporting Pez [...] "Simple Game", <b>Sentry's</b> second single, received high rotation on Triple J. <b>Sentry's</b> The Waitress Song then reached No. 31 in Triple J's 'Hottest 100' for 2009 and appeared on the compilation The Best of Australian Hip Hop Vol. 1.|$|R

5|$|Chappuis {{was rescued}} by an Italian partisan, Aldo Comucci, a 21-year-old {{who was in}} charge of one of the many {{underground}} groups operating in the area. Comucci and his band of resistance fighters got to Chappuis before the Germans and hid him and two other American flyers from the same plane for nearly three months until the end of the war. The partisans passed Chappuis and the two other Americans from house to house, and village to village, toward the Swiss frontier. Dressed in shawls — but still wearing G.I. shoes — they once walked undetected past a German <b>sentry.</b>|$|E
5|$|E-3 <b>Sentry</b> {{aircraft}} {{were among}} the first to deploy during Operation Desert Shield, where they immediately established as an around-the-clock radar screen to defend against Iraqi forces. During Operation Desert Storm, E-3s flew 379 missions and logged 5,052 hours of on-station time. The data collection capability of the E-3 radar and computer subsystems allowed an entire air war to be recorded for the first time in history. In addition to providing senior leadership with time-critical information on the actions of enemy forces, E-3 controllers assisted in 38 of the 41 air-to-air kills recorded during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|E-767 – the Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) {{platform}} for the Japan Self-Defense Forces; it is essentially the Boeing E-3 <b>Sentry</b> mission package on a 767-200ER platform. E-767 modifications, completed on 767-200ERs flown from the Everett factory to Boeing Integrated Defense Systems in Wichita, Kansas, include strengthening to accommodate a dorsal surveillance radar system, engine nacelle alterations, as well as electrical and interior changes. Japan operates four E-767s. The first E-767s were delivered in March 1998.|$|E
50|$|According to one account, {{the allied}} tribes {{attacked}} in the morning, but were themselves ambushed by the <b>sentries</b> relieved from their evening duty. With the surprise {{attack of the}} <b>sentries,</b> from a flank, and a frontal assault by the main British column, the outnumbered Indians fled in a disorganized retreat.|$|R

Prior to 2002, <b>sentries</b> were permanently stationed {{at the entrance to}} Edinburgh Castle, but these were withdrawn due to cost-cutting measures. Today, <b>sentries</b> are posted during the evenings between 6 pm and 9 am, and throughout the week that HM The Queen spends in Edinburgh at both the castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse. <b>Sentries</b> are also posted at the castle during the month of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo prior to each performance, with the regiment forming a guard of honour {{at the end of each}} performance.|$|R
