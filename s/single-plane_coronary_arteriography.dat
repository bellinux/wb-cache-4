40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine if patients with an echocardiographic diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy should be submitted to <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography.</b> BACKGROUND: Whether echocardiography allows distinction of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy from severe coronary heart disease remains controversial. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent out {{to the members of the}} Swiss Society of Cardiology. In the first study 78 patients with an echocardiographic diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who had undergone <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> or had been followed-up for > 5 years were investigated. In a second study, the echocardiograms of 50 patients with either idiopathic cardiomyopathy or severe coronary heart disease, all of whom had also undergone <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography,</b> were reviewed by two independent echocardiographers without access to any complementary information. RESULT: The questionnaire revealed that one half of the Swiss cardiologists generally refer such patients for <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography.</b> The first study showed that the diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy was confirmed in all cases, in which the echocardiographer had been certain of the diagnosis (64 / 78 [82 %]). In the uncertain cases (14 [18 %]) <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> revealed 9 idiopathic cardiomyopathies, 3 coronary heart diseases, and 2 mixed etiologies. The second study showed that a correct diagnosis was achieved in 85 % of cases. Furthermore, the echocardiographers were able to specify those patients with an uncertain diagnosis who would therefore require <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In the overwhelming majority of cases, echocardiography can distinguish idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy from severe coronary heart disease. <b>Coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> is only indicated when the echocardiographer is uncertain of the diagnosis. The routine and costly practice of <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> of these patients does not appear to be justified...|$|R

Controversy has arisen about the health benefits and risks of coronary surgery and, more recently of coronary angioplasty. As a clinical prerequisite to these interventions, <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> can be considered an indicator of invasive services offered to coronary heart disease patients. We collected data on characteristics of all patients subjected to <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> during 1984 in Switzerland.

This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the accuracy and safety of selective anterograde <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> for the identification of the origin and branching pattern of the three main coronary arteries in neonates with d-transposition of the great arteries. Background. Definition of coronary artery anatomy is important in neonates with d-transposition of the great arteries who are considered for the arterial switch operation. Balloon occlusion bortography defines coronary artery anatomy in most but not all cases. We have described a technique for selective anterograde <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography.</b> Methods. Between March 1987 and May 1991, 17 neonates underwent selective anterograde <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> and 29 patients had balloon occlusion aortography. After venous access was gained, a mesenteric catheter was used to engage the coronary ostia for contrast injection. All angiograms were reviewed by three independent observers and the coronary artery diagnoses were compared with operative findings. Complications with the catheterization procedure were also recorded. Results. The accuracy of defining coronary artery anatomy with selective anterograde <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> (98 ± 2 %) was significantly (p 0. 05) and was related to transient bradycardia induced by catheter manipulation in the right ventricle. No patient in either study group experienced cardiac ischemia. Conclusions. Selective anterograde <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> is an accurate and safe technique for the definition of coronary artery pattern in neonates with d-transposition of the great arteries...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} the feasibility, safety, and diagnostic accuracy of <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> in the radiology department of a district general hospital using conventional fluoroscopy and videotape recording. DESIGN [...] Observational {{study of the}} feasibility and safety of <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> in a district general hospital and analysis of its diagnostic accuracy by prospective within patient comparison of the video recordings with cinearteriograms obtained in a catheter laboratory. SETTING [...] Radiology department of a district general hospital and the catheter laboratory of a cardiological referral centre. SUBJECTS [...] 50 Patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with streptokinase who underwent <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> in a district general hospital three (two to five) days after admission. 45 Of these patients had repeat <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> after four (three to seven) days in the catheter laboratory of a cardiological referral centre. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Incidence of complications associated with catheterisation and the sensitivity and specificity of video recordings in the district general hospital (judged by two experienced observers) for identifying the location and severity of coronary stenoses. RESULTS [...] Coronary arteriograms recorded on videotape in the district general hospital were obtained in 47 cases and apart from one episode of ventricular fibrilation (treated successfully by cardioversion) there were no complications of the procedure. 45 Patients were transferred for investigation in the catheter laboratory, providing 45 paired coronary arteriograms recorded on videotape and cine film. The specificity of the video recordings for identifying the location and severity of coronary stenoses was over 90 %. Sensitivity, however, was lower and for one observer fell below 40 % for lesions in the circumflex artery. A cardiothoracic surgeon judged that only nine of the 47 video recordings were adequate for assessing revascularisation requirements.

40|$|Anomalous {{origin of}} the {{circumflex}} coronary artery from the proximal right coronary artery or right sinus of Valsalva was recognized in 20 of 2996 patients undergoing selective <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> (0. 67 %). The relative frequency of this anomaly demands {{a high level of}} anticipation during the performance of selective <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> to assure that an adequate study has been obtained. Failure to recognize and properly demonstrate the anomaly can be hazardous to patient management. Two angiographic signs have proved reliable in recognizing the anomalous artery before its selective demonstration. These signs are a profile view of the artery behind the aortic root during left ven-triculography (the-aortic root sign") and recognition of absent arterial inflow to a significant area of the posterior lateral left ventricle during selective injections of the main left coronary artery (the 'sign of non-perfused myocardium"). These angiographic signs are described and the clinical implications of proper demonstration of the anomalous circumflex coronary artery are discussed. Additional Indexing Words: <b>Coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> RIGIN of the left circumflex coronary artery from the right sinus of Valsalva is a well known anatomic variation which has no clinical significance per se. Recognition and angiographic demonstration of the anomalous artery assumes high priority, however, in patients undergoing evaluation for direct coronary artery surgery or prosthetic valve replacement. This anomaly has been recognized in 0. 67 % of patients undergoing selective <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> in our laboratory. Certain angiographic signs during left ventriculography and selective opacification of the left coronary artery have proved reliable in recognizing the presence of the anomaly, thus allowing its proper demonstration.

40|$|AbstractTo {{ascertain}} whether predischarge arteriography is beneficial {{in patients with}} acute myocardial infarction treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt PA), heparin and aspirin, the outcome of 197 patients in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) HA study assigned to conservative management and routine predischarge <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> (routine catheterization group) was compared with the outcome of 1, 461 patients from the TIMI IIB study assigned to conservative management without routine <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> unless ischemia recurred spontaneously or on predischarge exercise testing (selective catheterization group). The two groups were similar with regard to important baseline variables. During the initial hospital stay, <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> was performed in 93. 9 % of the routine catheterization group and 34. 7 % of the selective catheterization group (p < 0. 001), but the frequency of coronary revascularization (angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery) was similar {{in the two groups}} (24. 4 % versus 20. 7 %, p = NS). Coronary arteriograms showed a predominance of zero or one vessel disease (stenosis ≥ 60 %) in both groups (routine catheterization group 73. 1 %, selective catheterization group 61. 3 %). During the 1 st year after infarction, rehospitalization for cardiac reasons and the interim performance of <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> were more common in the selective catheterization group (37. 9 % versus 27. 6 %, p = 0. 007 and 28. 6 % versus 11. 6 %, p < 0. 001, respectively); however, the interim rates of death, nonfatal reinfarction and performance of coronary revascularization procedures were similar.

These patients were re-evaluated before <b>coronary</b> <b>arteriography</b> using the peak-exercise heart rate as an index of adrenergic beta-receptor antagonism. The dose of beta-blocking drugs was increased to produce a peak-exercise heart rate of less than 100 beats/min or a consistent rate of 100 - 125 beats/min which would not lessen in spite of progressive dose increments.
