5|$|Positive airway pressure, {{initially}} in {{the form}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), is a useful treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when obstructive <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea</b> co-exists. CPAP requires the use during sleep of a machine that delivers a continuous positive pressure to the airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues in the throat during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the mouth and nose together or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This relieves the features of obstructive <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea</b> and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. The pressure is increased until the obstructive symptoms (snoring and periods of apnea) have disappeared. CPAP alone is effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause {{respiratory}} depression in susceptible individuals.

5|$|Most {{people with}} obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} have concurrent obstructive <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea,</b> a condition characterized by snoring, brief episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) during the night, interrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In OHS, sleepiness may be worsened by elevated {{blood levels of}} carbon dioxide, which causes drowsiness ("CO2 narcosis").

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and degree of heart failure (HF) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). A total of 3017 patients (77. 4 % men and 22. 6 % women) were included in the study. Clinical examination and echocardiography for evaluation of HF using NYHA functional classification and sleep polysomnography were performed. The study demonstrated that SDB is more common in CHD patients with higher NYHA functional class. The prevalence of central <b>sleep</b> <b>apneas</b> against obstructive apneas was observed in patients with mild and moderate HF. The number of central apneas was strongly related to the severity of heart failure. More frequent appearance of central <b>sleep</b> <b>apneas</b> is predominantly due to instability of ventilatory control systems during sleep because of impaired cardiac function in HF patients. Sleep architecture was more disturbed in CHD patients with higher NYHA functional class. A gradual increase of stage 1 and wakefulness after sleep onset and a decrease of sleep stages 3 - 4 and REM sleep as well as a diminution of sleep efficiency with worsening of NYHA functional class were observed. We suggest that both SDB and disturbed sleep variables independently significantly correlate with manifestation of HF. </p...|$|R

5|$|The blunted {{ventilatory}} {{response is}} attributed to several factors. Obese people tend to have raised levels of the hormone leptin, which is secreted by adipose tissue and under normal circumstances increases ventilation. In OHS, this effect is reduced. Furthermore, episodes of nighttime acidosis (e.g. due to <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea)</b> lead to compensation by the kidneys with retention of the alkali bicarbonate. This normalizes the acidity of the blood. However, bicarbonate stays around in the bloodstream for longer, and further episodes of hypercapnia lead to relatively mild acidosis and reduced ventilatory response in a vicious circle.|$|E
5|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} Pickwickian syndrome) {{is a condition}} in which severely overweight people fail to breathe rapidly enough or deeply enough, resulting in low blood oxygen levels and high blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Many people with this condition also frequently stop breathing altogether for short periods of time during sleep (obstructive <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea),</b> resulting in many partial awakenings during the night, which leads to continual sleepiness during the day. The disease puts strain on the heart, which eventually may lead to the symptoms such as heart failure, leg swelling and various other related symptoms. The most effective treatment is weight loss, but it is often possible to relieve the symptoms by nocturnal ventilation with positive airway pressure (CPAP) or related methods.|$|E
5|$|When {{examining}} {{groups of}} people with obstructive <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea,</b> {{researchers have found that}} 10‚Äì20% of them meet the criteria for OHS as well. The risk of OHS is much higher in those with more severe obesity, i.e. a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher. It is twice as common in men compared to women. The average age at diagnosis is 52. American Black {{people are more likely to}} be obese than American whites, and are therefore more likely to develop OHS, but obese Asians are more likely than people of other ethnicities to have OHS at a lower BMI as a result of physical characteristics.|$|E
40|$|Apnea {{severity}} {{is considered}} a risk marker and/or factor, because it contributes, via sympathetic activation and worsening of hemodynamics, to disease evolution, life-threatening arrhythmias, and fatal outcome. This was demonstrated {{in the presence of}} either central <b>sleep</b> <b>apneas</b> (CSA), with high values of the apnea-hypopnea index, or in central apneas during wakefulness. As an alternative interpretation, central apneas have been regarded as a compensatory response, because of positive physiological effects associated with the hyperpneic phase of the cycle, such as amelioration of gas exchange (for increased end-expiratory lung volume), desirable respiratory alkalosis, lytic effect on sympathetic activation, and improved bronchial patency. The pathophysiology of CSA in HF is complex; the main mechanism is identified to be an enhanced peripheral and/or central chemosensitivity, with apneas occurring after intense hyperventilation, due to hypoxia and/or hypercapnia. The circulatory delay between the lung and the chemoreceptors, as well as a reduction in either oxygen or carbon dioxide (CO 2) lung stores may favor CSA maintenance. Finally, lung congestion may also increase ventilation instability via pulmonary J-receptors. A rational treatment would better counteract the pathophysiological triggers than targeting (<b>sleep)</b> <b>apneas</b> only. However, further comprehension of the complex interaction among the diverse, specific pathogenic mechanisms that lead to OSA and/or CSA may promote the identification of those needing a targeted treatment and the development of novel therapeutic strategies that could be tailored according to the diagnosed underlying mechanisms in the individual patient...|$|R

In addition, the prevalence of sleep-related apnea is dramatically elevated in the elderly, ranging from 28% to 67% of that population. <b>Sleep</b> <b>apnea</b> can lead to high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, memory problems, weight gain, headaches and death. Since there were no medicines to alleviate this condition, Radulovacki and Carley set out to develop a drug treatment.

40|$|AbstractThe Kleine‚ÄìLevin Syndrome is a {{differential}} diagnosis {{for patients with}} diurnal excessive sleepiness and a suspicion of narcolepsy. It is characterized by paroxysmal attacks of diurnal excessive sleepiness, associated {{with one or more}} symptoms of hyperphagia, hypersexuality, coprolalia and copropraxia. During crisis intervals, there are no symptoms. This pathology predominantly manifests itself in teenagers, being more frequent among males. The course of this disease is unpredictable, with variable duration and frequency. The most accepted physiopathology is that of a hypothalamic dysfunction, although and recently, there has appeared a hypothesis of a post-infectious autoimmune disorder. These patients show an elevated body mass index, which can predispose to association with comorbidities such as the <b>sleep</b> obstructive <b>apnea</b> syndrome.

Mice carrying one invalidated Phox 2 b allele (Phox 2 b(+/-)) show mild autonomic disorders including <b>sleep</b> <b>apneas,</b> and impairments in chemosensitivity and thermoregulation that recover within 10 days of postnatal age. Because Phox 2 b is not expressed above the pons nor in the cerebellum, this mutation is not expected to affect brain development and cognitive functioning directly. However, the transient physiological disorders in Phox 2 b(+/-) mice might impair neurodevelopment. To examine this possibility, we conducted a behavioral test battery of emotional, motor, and cognitive functioning in adult Phox 2 b(+/-) mice and their wildtype littermates (Phox 2 b(+/+)). Adult Phox 2 b(+/-) mice showed altered exploratory behavior in the open field and in the elevated plus maze, both indicative of anxiety.
