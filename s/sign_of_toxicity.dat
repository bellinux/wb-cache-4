40|$|Horizontal {{nystagmus}} is a sustaining, abnormal {{eye movement}} {{and an early}} clinical <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxicity</b> following nerve agent exposure. Nerve agent exposure-induced nystagmus can degenerate into ocular flutter (2 – 3 Hz) in laboratory animal experiments. Ocular flutter can be reversible which is curious given the irreversibility of acetylcholinesterase inhibition by nerve agents. Reversed ocular flutter can {{be followed by a}} return of horizontal nystagmus for a limited period. As cholinergic neurotransmission has been implicated in the initiation and control of saccadic eye movements, we review oculormotor circuits and propose a mechanism for ocular flutter involving the cholinergic input to the intermediate layer of the superior colliculus. The reversible nature of ocular flutter may be due to desensitization of nicotinic cholinergic receptor subtype populations involved in partly modulating saccade generation...|$|E
40|$|Radiation {{treatment}} {{in the management of}} pituitary adenoma in children is still a controversy due to the great concern of late radiation effect. Stereotactic radiation therapy is the modern radiation technique that is more widely applicable in pituitary adenoma because of the ability to give highly conformal radiation to the target organ and to reduce the radiation dose to normal tissue. A 15 -year-old boy presented with postradiation therapy recurrence pituitary macroadenoma. His vision was useful only on the left eye. MRI revealed the recurrent macroadenoma with severe invasion of optic apparatus. Since no any other treatment option was to be given to this patient, we decided to reirradiate the patient with conventional fractionated stereotactic radiation. At 3 months of followup, MRI showed that the tumor had an early and significant reduction in size without any <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxicity...</b>|$|E

40|$|Anti-inflammatory and Antioxidant {{activities}} of the aqueous (CFA) and methanolic extracts (CFM) of the Cassia fistula Linn. bark were assayed in wistar albino rats. The extracts were found to posses significant anti-inflammatory effect in both acute and chronic models. Cassia fistula bark extracts showed significant radical scavenging by inhibiting lipid peroxidation initiated by CCl 4 and FeSO 4 in rat liver and kidney homogenates. Both extracts exhibited significant antioxidant activity in DPPH, Nitric oxide and Hydroxyl radical induced invitro assay methods. Both extracts showed Dose-Dependent protective effect against lipid peroxidation and free radical generation in liver and kidney homogenates. Further, the acute toxicity study with the extracts showed no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxicity</b> up to a dose level of 2000 mg / po.
