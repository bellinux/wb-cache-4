5|$|With {{the decline}} in the empire's {{resources}} following losses in population and territory, domes in Byzantine architecture were used as part of more modest new buildings. The large-scale churches of Byzantium were, however, kept in good repair. The upper portion of the Church of Hagia Irene was thoroughly rebuilt after an earthquake in 740. The nave was re-covered with an elliptical domical vault hidden externally by a low cylinder on the roof, in place of the earlier barrel vaulted ceiling, and the original central dome from the Justinian era was replaced with one raised upon a high windowed drum. The barrel vaults supporting these two new domes were also extended out over the side aisles, creating cross-domed units. By bracing the dome with broad arches on all four sides, the cross-domed unit provided a more secure <b>structural</b> <b>system.</b> These units, with most domes raised on drums, became a standard element on a smaller scale in later Byzantine church architecture, and all domes built after the transitional period were braced with bilateral symmetry.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{high-rise}} {{buildings in the}} world are both booming in quantity and expanding in height. One of the most important reasons driven the achievement is the continuously evolvement of <b>structural</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper, previous classifications of <b>structural</b> <b>systems</b> are summarized and different types of <b>structural</b> <b>systems</b> are introduced. Besides the <b>structural</b> <b>systems,</b> innovations in other aspects of today's design of high-rise buildings including damping systems, construction techniques, elevator systems as well as sustainability are presented and discussed. To better understand current high-rise buildings, information about buildings above 200 meter completed within recent ten years and the current 100 tallest building in the world is collected and analyzed. <b>Structural</b> <b>systems</b> of worldwide 100 tallest buildings are discussed, from which trends are found. Data shows that tubular systems are in vast majority in recent high-rise building designs and an increasing number of buildings are using concrete and composite materials instead of steel. Developments in <b>structural</b> <b>systems</b> also reduce structures' dependence on auxiliary damping devices. Additionally, sustainability has been given more and more consideration. by Wenjia Gu. Thesis: M. Eng., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, 2015.

40|$|Abstract — It is {{observed}} {{that there is}} a need the study of <b>structural</b> <b>systems</b> for R. C. C framed structure, which resist the lateral loads due to seismic effect. Safety and minimum damage level of a structure could be the prime requirement of tall buildings. To meet these requirements, the structure should have adequate lateral strength, lateral stiffness and sufficient ductility. Among the various <b>structural</b> <b>systems,</b> shear wall frame or braced concrete frame could be a point of choice for designer. Therefore, it attracts to review and observe the behavior of these <b>structural</b> <b>systems</b> under seismic effect. Hence, it is proposed to study the dynamic behavior of reinforced concrete frame with and without shear wall and concrete braced frame. The purpose of this study is to compare the seismic response of above <b>structural</b> <b>systems.</b> Axial forces and moments in members and floor displacements will be compared...|$|R

Politician Alexander Beresford Hope and architect Butterfield had agreed upon the general details just a month after Ruskin's book was published and by August they had revised their plans to encapsulate the principles it espoused.

Following this structure, small mausoleums, crypts and niches were lined up on a central pathway that led to a small chapel located {{at the center of the}} cemetery. The cemetery was totally enclosed by very high walls that still remain. Most mausoleums and crypts were constructed following the neo-classical style trend that prevailed at the time. Thick walls and piers were used as the main <b>structural</b> <b>system.</b> These were constructed using brick/"argarnasa", stone and mortar.|$|E

25|$|Nautica Windpower has {{proposed}} a technique for potentially reducing system weight, complexity and costs for deepwater sites. Scale model tests in open water have been conducted (September 2007) in Lake Erie and structural dynamics modeling was done in 2010 for larger designs. Nautica Windpower's Advanced Floating Turbine (AFT) uses a single mooring line and a downwind two-bladed rotor configuration that is deflection tolerant and aligns itself with the wind without an active yaw system. Two-bladed, downwind turbine designs that can accommodate flexibility in the blades will potentially prolong blade lifetime, diminish <b>structural</b> <b>system</b> loads and reduce offshore maintenance needs, yielding lower lifecycle costs.|$|E

High-strength concrete is a material familiar to Asian contractors and twice as effective as steel in sway reduction; however, it makes the building twice as heavy on its foundation as a comparable steel building. Supported by 23-by-23 metre concrete cores and an outer ring of widely spaced super columns, the towers use a sophisticated <b>structural</b> <b>system</b> that accommodates its slender profile and provides 560,000 square metres of column-free office space.

25|$|PCL Construction {{was awarded}} the contract, and {{construction}} began early in 2004, with a budget of $CDN28 million. For the <b>structural</b> <b>system,</b> Manasc and its consulting engineer decided to use flat concrete slabs instead of more conventional steel framing, for two reasons. First, the concrete could be produced locally. Second, it used concrete with 25% fly ash, which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from making concrete by up to 40%. Greenstone thus became the first project in Yellowknife to use concrete made that way, establishing the capacity for further use in other construction. The frame was covered with an insulated, pressure-equalized rainscreen clad in stucco, which uses less energy in its production. To preserve the building's warmth better, triple-glazed windows were set in fiberglass frames.|$|E

This paper reviews {{the evolution of}} tall building’s <b>structural</b> <b>systems</b> and the technological driving force behind tall building developments. For the primary <b>structural</b> <b>systems,</b> a new classification – interior structures and exterior structures – is presented. While most representative <b>structural</b> <b>systems</b> for tall buildings are discussed, the emphasis in this review paper is on current trends such as outrigger systems and diagrid structures. Auxiliary damping systems controlling building motion are also discussed. Further, contemporary “out-of-the-box ” architectural design trends, such as aerodynamic and twisted forms, which directly or indirectly affect the structural performance of tall buildings, are reviewed. Finally, the future of structural developments in tall buildings is envisioned briefly...|$|R
