25|$|There exists no theory elucidating {{correlations}} among L-amino acids. If one takes, for example, alanine, {{which has a}} small methyl group, and phenylalanine, which has a larger benzyl group, a <b>simple</b> <b>question</b> is in what aspect, L-alanine resembles L-phenylalanine more than D-phenylalanine, {{and what kind of}} mechanism causes the selection of all L-amino acids. Because it might be possible that alanine was L and phenylalanine was D.|$|E
25|$|Emphasis and {{contrast}} may override normal stress. Pronouns frequently take stress because of this. In a <b>simple</b> <b>question</b> like Ĉu vi vídis? ('Did you see?'), the pronoun hardly {{needs to be}} said and is unstressed; compare Né, dónu al mí and ('No, give me). Within a word, a prefix that wasn't heard correctly may be stressed upon repetition: Né, ne tíen! Iru máldekstren, mi diris! ('No, not over there! Go left, I said!'). Because stress doesn't distinguish words in Esperanto, shifting it to an unexpected syllable calls attention to that syllable, but doesn't cause confusion as it might in English.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of the Bible and slavery {{in the era of}} the Civil War was never a <b>simple</b> <b>question.</b> The issue involved the American expression of a Reformed literal hermeneutic, the failure of hermeneutical alternatives to gain cultural authority, and the exercise of deeply entrenched intuitive racism, as well as the presence of Scripture as an authoritative religious book and slavery as an inherited social-economic relationship. The North– forced to fight on unfriendly terrain that it had helped to create– lost the exegetical war. The South certainly lost the shooting war. But constructive orthodox theology was the major loser when American believers allowed bullets instead of hermeneutical self-consciousness to determine what the Bible said about slavery. For the history of theology in America, the great tragedy of the Civil War is that the most persuasive theologians were the Rev. Drs. William Tecumseh Sherman and Ulysses S. Grant.|$|E

Clarke also outlined Gordon-Cumming's [...] system of placing bets which, he explained, could have been mistaken by the inexperienced players as cheating, rather than a correct method of gambling. After his opening speech, Clarke then questioned Gordon-Cumming, and his approach was to show that Gordon-Cumming [...] "was a man of honour who had been sacrificed to save the courtiers".|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Evangelical {{journalist}} Richard Abanes, who {{has written}} several books arguing against new religions and Mormonism, published a polemical text that made similar allegations to the video: Harry Potter and the Bible: The Menace Behind the Magick. Later editions incorporated comparisons and contrasts between Harry Potter and the more overtly Christian works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. In an interview with CBN.com, Abanes remarked that, [...] "One of the easiest ways to know whether a fantasy book or film has real world magick in it is to just ask a <b>simple</b> <b>question,</b> 'Can my child find information in a library or bookstore that {{will enable them to}} replicate what they are seeing in the film or the book?' If you go to The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings what you see in, story magic and imagination, it is not real. You can't replicate it. But if you go to something like Harry Potter, you can find references to astrology, clairvoyance, and numerology. It takes seconds to go into a bookstore or library and get books on that and start investigating it, researching it, and doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|When Jefferson took office, {{he moved}} {{as quickly as}} {{possible}} to fill his cabinet positions. Although he had asked James Madison to be his Secretary of State, Madison did not arrive in Washington until May 1, 1801, due to illness. In the interim, Jefferson asked Lincoln to act temporarily as Secretary of State, which he did from March 5, 1801, until Madison assumed his duties on May 2. During this time, Lincoln was involved in actions that led to the celebrated Marbury v. Madison case concerning judicial review. In the later days of the John Adams administration, the President issued a large number of commissions, some of which had not been delivered by John Marshall, his Secretary of State, at the time Jefferson assumed office. Jefferson ordered Lincoln (in his capacity as acting Secretary of State), and then Madison (after his assumption of the position) not to deliver these commissions. Some intended recipients of these commissions, William Marbury among them, filed a suit in the United States Supreme Court to compel their delivery. In his role as Attorney General, Lincoln was present at the preliminary hearing on the case, representing Madison. When the case was heard (ironically by a court headed by John Marshall, the preparer of the commissions), Lincoln was called to the stand by Marbury's attorney, former Attorney General Charles Lee. Rather than answer Lee's questions, Lincoln invoked both executive privilege and the Fifth Amendment, requesting the opportunity to consider whether or not to answer the questions. The justices granted him time, but {{made it clear that he}} must either answer the questions or clearly justify his objections to specific written questions. When Lincoln returned the next day, he answered all of the posed questions but one. Asked [...] "hat had been done with the commissions", Lincoln refused to answer directly, only stating that he did not know if Madison ever received them. The opposition press criticized Lincoln for this performance, writing that he [...] "was asked a <b>simple</b> <b>question,</b> but could not answer it until they gave it to him in writing, [...] and then he made out to remember that he had forgot all about it".|$|E

The readings were now about dreams, coincidence (synchronicity), developing intuition, karma, the akashic records, astrology, past-life relationships, soul mates and other esoteric subjects. Hundreds of books have been published about these readings.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Kennedy faulted the Court for skewing a <b>simple</b> <b>question</b> of {{statutory}} interpretation by invoking the [...] "specter of grave and doubtful constitutional interpretations". [...] He {{believed that the}} Court's textual analysis was incorrect, and that the constitutional rule the Court formulated would [...] "upset the proper federal balance" [...] of power between the judiciary and the legislature. [...] As far as the textual analysis was concerned, {{the fact that the}} opening paragraph was complete in itself, and that the first subsection added no new facts, led Kennedy to conclude that the other two were mere sentencing enhancements. [...] "Serious bodily harm", like recidivism, was [...] "as typical a sentencing factor as one might imagine"; indeed, Kennedy pointed to the laws of several states that made the magnitude of harm to the victim or victims the basis for increased criminal punishment. [...] Significant differences between the structure of the federal carjacking statute and both the other federal robbery statutes and the state statutes on which the majority relied also suggested to Kennedy that the text of the federal carjacking statute made [...] "serious bodily injury" [...] a sentencing factor.|$|E

The team will be allotted their own private box at the venue, and will get a chance to meet the band afterward. Along the same lines, a Swiss radio station 20 Minuten hosted a similar competition for listeners. They had a pair of tickets for the concert for the Royal Albert Hall concert of 24 November to give away. All flight and hotel accommodation costs were paid for by the radio station. UK radio station Xfm organized {{a competition}} called [...] "Xfm's Snow Patrol Bad Photoshop Challenge", with ten pairs of tickets were up to win. These tickets would enable fans to see the band rehearse in a yet-unnamed location in Brighton at the eve of the Reworked Tour. The challenge was to associate five photoshopped pictures with Snow Patrol song titles. The competition will end on 10 November 2009. A further fifteen pairs of tickets will be given away on air. Tickets for the intimate acoustic show in London for the promotion of Up to Now could only be obtained via two competitions, one organized on Play.com and the other on the band's official website. Both involved answering a <b>simple</b> <b>question.</b> For the HMV singing and performance, wristbands were available from 9am on 3 December 2009.

2500|$|Founded in 1976, the Law School {{is named}} for Supreme Court Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo. Cardozo, {{who was born in}} 1870 in New York City, and was renowned for his integrity, social consciousness, and {{important}} opinions. Cardozo studied law at Columbia Law School from 1889–91 and subsequently rose to prominence during 23 years of private practice, becoming known as a lawyer’s lawyer before appointment to the New York State Court of Appeals in 1914. His tenure was marked by a number of original rulings, in tort and contract law in particular. This is partly due to timing; rapid industrialization was forcing courts to look anew at old common law components to adapt to new settings. He became the nation’s best-known and most admired state court judge. He added to his reputation through highly acclaimed off-the-bench writings, of which the most important is The Nature of the Judicial Process (1921). Shortly thereafter, Cardozo {{became a member of the}} group that founded the American Law Institute, which crafted a Restatement of the Law of Torts, Contracts, and a host of other private law subjects. He wrote three other books that also became standards in the legal world. By asking, and answering, the monumentally <b>simple</b> <b>question,</b> [...] "What is it that I do when I decide a case?", he helped many see the judicial role with greater clarity. In 1932, President Herbert Hoover appointed Cardozo to succeed Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. on the Supreme Court. In his six years as an Associate Justice, he handed down opinions that stressed the necessity for the law to adapt to the realities and needs of modern life. The New York Times said of Cardozo's appointment that [...] "seldom, if ever, in the history of the Court has an appointment been so universally commended." [...] Democratic Cardozo's appointment by a Republican president has been referred to as one of the few Supreme Court appointments in history not motivated by partisanship or politics, but strictly based on the nominee's contribution to law.|$|E
