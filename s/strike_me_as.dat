500|$|Den of Geek {{selected}} the episode's special effects {{as a positive}} element, but was more critical of the episode as a whole. [...] "As Fringe goes," [...] the website explained, [...] "this ended up a rather lightweight narrative, which was more about getting Lincoln established with Fringe, and providing a few new plotlines that the subsequent stories can expand on." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler was equally ambivalent, and gave the episode a score of 7.5 out of 10. He observed, [...] "It isn't a bad episode. It's a good addition to the Fringe lore. It's well-written, has plenty of action, and the actors are great as usual. But it just doesn't feel like a fulfilling continuation of last season's cliffhanger, nor does it <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a fantastic new direction for the season." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{recording}} {{there was}} pressure from I.R.S. Records {{to try to}} make the album more commercial. The label sent messages to Dixon and Easter, which the producers told the band that they would ignore. While the producers respected I.R.S. president Jay Boberg, they expressed dismay at the comments he made when he visited during the last day of sessions. Dixon called Boberg [...] "record company clueless", while Easter said [...] "I got along with Jay Boberg OK [...] but now and again he would express an opinion that would make me think, 'holy shit', because it would <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> really teenage." [...] Buck said he was grateful that Dixon and Easter acted as a buffer between the band and its label. He said that [...] "it got to the point where as much as I respected the guys at I.R.S., we basically tried to record the records so they wouldn't know we were recording them!", and explained that part of the reason why R.E.M. recorded the album so quickly was that the group wanted to finish before representatives from I.R.S. showed up to listen to it.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2015three {{months after}} the release of the Wilson Reportit was {{revealed}} that the TDSB had placed a covert camera inside a clock located in the office of a TDSB principal. [...] About the incident, Wilson commented [...] "It did <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> part of the whole climate at the board". [...] Following that revelation, TDSB Director Donna Quan issued a statement assuring [...] "there are currently no hidden cameras in any office of a principal/vice-principal employed by the TDSB." ...|$|E

2500|$|Steve Englehart, {{who wrote}} issues #5–16, said Graham [...] "helped me plot, {{so that by}} the end it was pretty much a co-production." [...] Graham is {{formally}} credited as co-writer of issues #14-15, though as Englehart's writing collaborator for those issues, Tony Isabella recalled, [...] "Billy Graham is credited as the co-scripter of my first issue [...] and, try as I might, I simply do not recall getting anything other than the usual penciled pages to script. I skimmed a little of that issue and, making no judgment as to whether this is a good or bad thing, the writing does <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> all mine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ibrahim Hooper, Communications Director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), {{charged that}} the {{controversy}} was [...] "manufactured" [...] by [...] "bigots". He also asserted that only a vocal minority was complaining. And Nihad Awad, CAIR's Executive Director, said that the opinion of Republican Congressman Peter King [...] "should not be considered, because his ideas are extreme". Fareed Zakaria, Newsweek journalist and CNN host, also strongly supported the project, and returned a prestigious award he received in 2005 from the Anti-Defamation League, saying he was [...] "personally and deeply saddened" [...] by their opposition towards the project. He wrote: [...] "...Rauf, is a moderate Muslim clergyman. He has said one or two things about American foreign policy that <b>strike</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> overly critical – but it's stuff you could read on The Huffington Post any day. On Islam, his main subject, Abdul Rauf's views are clear: he routinely denounces all terrorism – as he did again last week, publicly." ...|$|E
