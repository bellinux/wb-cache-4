5|$|Similarly, {{different}} court systems existed. In Nejd, {{there was}} a <b>simple</b> <b>system</b> of single judges {{for each of the}} major towns. The judge was appointed by the local governor, with whom he worked closely to dispose of cases. In the Hejaz, {{there was a}} more sophisticated system, with courts comprising panels of judges. In 1925, Abdul Aziz Al Saud of Nejd conquered the Hejaz and united it with his existing territories to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1927, the king introduced a new court system to the Hejaz comprising general and summary courts and ordered that Hanbali fiqh should be used. However, Nejd's traditional system of judges was left in place in the face of conservative opposition from the Nejd religious establishment.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{framework of}} the building utilises a <b>simple</b> <b>system</b> of reinforced concrete beams and slabs, and was originally clad in square mosaic and rectangular ceramic tiles on its walls and columns. The building's foundation comprises large diameter bored piles installed in decomposed sandstone. Beams span an average 7.6 metres except at the main entrance where post-tensioned concrete beams span 15 metres. The auditorium is roofed over by 24-metre long steel trusses with a composite reinforced concrete covering.|$|E

25|$|Under some circumstances, {{perturbation}} theory is an invalid approach to take. This {{happens when the}} system we wish to describe cannot be described by a small perturbation imposed on some <b>simple</b> <b>system.</b> In quantum chromodynamics, for instance, the interaction of quarks with the gluon field cannot be treated perturbatively at low energies because the coupling constant (the expansion parameter) becomes too large.|$|E

25|$|In {{its most}} {{primitive}} form the bombard has six open holes {{and possibly a}} seventh that is often closed with a key. It has a range of just over an octave.

In the contemporary setting bombards may also have complex <b>simple</b> <b>system</b> key-work enabling significant chromatic possibilities. In Breton, the bombard is also known as the talabard, and a bombard player as a talabarder.|$|E
25|$|Gravitational waves carry energy {{away from}} their sources and, {{in the case of}} {{orbiting}} bodies, this is associated with an inspiral or decrease in orbit. Imagine for example a <b>simple</b> <b>system</b> of two masses — such as the Earth–Sun system — moving slowly compared to the speed of light in circular orbits. Assume that these two masses orbit each other in a circular orbit in the x'y plane. To a good approximation, the masses follow simple Keplerian orbits. However, such an orbit represents a changing quadrupole moment. That is, the system will give off gravitational waves.|$|E
