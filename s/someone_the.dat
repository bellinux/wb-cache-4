5|$|As Mr. Burns {{fights for}} {{life at the}} hospital, the Springfield police are working to find his assailant. Smithers wakes {{up the next morning}} and vaguely remembers {{shooting}} <b>someone</b> <b>the</b> night before in a drunken rage. Guilt-ridden, Smithers heads for a local church, and is promptly arrested when the confessional {{turns out to be a}} police sting. While passing the media on his way to the police station, Smithers makes a witty remark Sideshow Mel recognizes from an episode of Pardon My Zinger that aired at the same time as the shooting. Mel realizes Smithers must have watched it as well, giving him an alibi. As Smithers' memory clears, it turns out he had actually shot Jasper in his wooden leg. Meanwhile, the townsmen pull down the sun-blocker, which crushes Shelbyville to their delight.|$|E
5|$|In her interview, Swedish Detective Superintendent Kajsa Wahlberg {{describes}} purchasing sex from {{a prostitute}} as paying to masturbate into <b>someone.</b> <b>The</b> leader {{of an organization}} working to rescue girls from prostitution in Cambodia {{says that it is}} not the poorest parents who sell their children into sexual slavery but rather the parents who are looking to buy luxury goods. He therefore argues that sex trafficking is a spiritual and moral issue that cannot be solved by education or money. In another interview, a man purchasing sex in Thailand says that he believes the girls are happy to be working as prostitutes. Another interview features an American man who had been a sex tourist in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Lihau died on 9 April 1999 in Boston, {{seven days}} {{after the death of}} his wife in Kinshasa. He was {{initially}} buried in a Boston cemetery before his body was exhumed and entombed in Gombe, Kinshasa, on 12 May. Lihau's family never requested that an autopsy be performed on the corpse. In 2001 Kalokola, ostensibly on behalf of the Lihau family, filed a complaint against unknown persons with the attorney general of Kinshasa, claiming that Lihau had been murdered. He based his assertion on a strange visit that Lihau supposedly had with <b>someone</b> <b>the</b> day {{after the death of his}} wife and on unusual signs that were observed on Lihau's body when it was brought to Kinshasa.|$|E

5|$|A careful {{examination}} of Facsimile No. 2 {{shows that there}} is a difference between most of the hieroglyphic signs and the signs on the right third of the figure on the outer edge as well as the outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, to the rest of the text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially clear is the word snsn, in section 14, and part of the name of the mother of the owner of the papyrus, (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice on the outer edge. An ink drawing of the hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows these same areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and <b>someone</b> (<b>the</b> engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings papyrus for aesthetic purposes.|$|E
5|$|Siglinda Scarpa {{says she}} had issues with {{communication}} as a child, stating that “people were not seeing me, that they were talking, but never to me.” It was not until her father brought a stray kitten home and placed it under her sheets that Scarpa felt she could communicate with <b>someone.</b> <b>The</b> kitten was a year old when he became very ill and died. After his death, Scarpa decided to take in as many cats as possible, with the hopes of eventually creating {{a safe haven for}} cats. Scarpa created the Goathouse Refuge in 2007, naming it after an old goat who came with the dilapidated plantation house and the 16 acre property. Originally, the land was just intended for her pottery studio. After the house and studio burned down Scarpa rebuilt it with plans that included a sanctuary for cats, using personal resources and proceeds from her pottery sales to make it possible.|$|E

25|$|Teen sexual {{violence}} {{does not always}} equate with date rape, as the term might suggest; the term date rape may describe drug facilitated sexual assault (using drugs and/or alcohol), or a case of acquaintance rape (usually sexual assault by <b>someone</b> <b>the</b> victim doesn't know well, or just met).|$|E
25|$|After Anna died in 1882, in 1884 Douglass married again, to Helen Pitts, a white suffragist and {{abolitionist}} from Honeoye, New York. Pitts was {{the daughter}} of Gideon Pitts Jr., an abolitionist colleague and friend of Douglass. A graduate of Mount Holyoke College (then called Mount Holyoke Female Seminary), Pitts worked on a radical feminist publication named Alpha while living in Washington, D.C. The marriage provoked a storm of controversy, since Pitts was both white and nearly 20 years younger than Douglass. Her family stopped speaking to her; his children considered the marriage a repudiation of their mother. However, feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton congratulated the couple. Douglass responded to the criticisms by saying that his first marriage had been to <b>someone</b> <b>the</b> color of his mother, and his second to <b>someone</b> <b>the</b> color of his father.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{report of}} a black dog was in France in AD 856, when one was said to materialise in a church even though the doors were shut.

25|$|In the Harry Potter series (1997–2007) {{the most}} {{prominent}} werewolf is Remus Lupin who's portrayed as struggling with his curse and terrified of infecting <b>someone.</b> <b>The</b> series also includes a werewolf villain Fenrir Greyback, who fits more with the older image of werewolves. The Potter books, while showing the intense threat the humans transformed to bloodthirsty monsters pose to the population, essentially use werewolves {{as a metaphor for}} marginalised groups who have been discriminated against in modern society.|$|E

25|$|Aggression is overt, often harmful, social {{interaction}} {{with the intention of}} inflicting damage or other unpleasantness upon another individual. It may occur either in retaliation or without provocation. In humans, frustration due to blocked goals can cause aggression. Human aggression can be classified into direct and indirect aggression, whilst the first is characterized by physical or verbal behavior intended to cause harm to <b>someone,</b> <b>the</b> second one is characterized by a behavior intended to harm social relations of an individual or a group.|$|E
25|$|The mere-exposure {{effect is}} a {{psychological}} phenomenon by which people tend to develop a preference for things merely because they are familiar with them. In social psychology, this effect is sometimes called the familiarity principle. The effect has been demonstrated with many kinds of things, including words, Chinese characters, paintings, pictures of faces, geometric figures, and sounds. In studies of interpersonal attraction, the more often a person is seen by <b>someone,</b> <b>the</b> more pleasing and likeable that person appears to be.|$|E

25|$|During the Second World War, Luna Park was {{a magnet}} for servicemen; both those {{treating}} their girlfriends to a night out, and those looking to meet <b>someone.</b> <b>The</b> park's external lights were 'browned out' {{in case of a}} Japanese sneak attack on Sydney, the neon lights were disconnected, and non-essential uses of electricity (primarily for ride facades) were curtailed. The influx of servicemen drew prostitutes to the area, and large-scale brawls were a common occurrence - usually between Australian home defence troops and American sailors on shore leave.|$|E
25|$|All legal {{procedures}} concerned with probate (as defined above) come within {{the jurisdiction of}} the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice by virtue of Section 25 of the Senior Courts Act 1981.

It is the production and issuing of these documents, known collectively as grants of representation, that is the primary function of the Probate Registries, which are part of the High Court, which the general public and probate professionals alike apply to for grants of representation.|$|E
