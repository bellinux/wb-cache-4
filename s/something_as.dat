5|$|The prosecutive case {{describes}} {{movement through}} <b>something</b> <b>as</b> {{well as the}} medium of writing or a location on the body. It {{is also used to}} describe a group of people such as a family as belonging to the modified noun.|$|E
5|$|Stowe, a Connecticut-born {{teacher at}} the Hartford Female Seminary and an active abolitionist, {{featured}} the character of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave around whom the stories of other characters revolve.

5|$|The {{illustrations}} {{provide insight}} into life and festivities at the Heian Palace; which sometimes consisted of <b>something</b> <b>as</b> simple as games on the lake although those might have been perceived differently {{at the time of}} manufacture. Like other picture scrolls on court life such as the Genji Monogatari Emaki or the Pillow Book Emaki (Makura no Sōshi Emaki) they provide valuable information on the architectural shinden-zukuri style (particularly on interiors) which is characterized by a mixture of Tang and traditional Japanese influences.|$|E

5000|$|For Homecoming Week, the {{students}} and faculty of HCHS use the days to [...] "pep up" [...] the team by having specific [...] "special" [...] days, where {{the students}} and faculty dress <b>as</b> <b>something</b> oriented with that specific day, for example, [...] "Welcome to the Jungle Day", where one would dress up <b>as</b> <b>something</b> from the jungle or <b>as</b> <b>something</b> wild, such <b>as</b> a rock star or cave people.|$|R
25|$|Del Bascom — {{independent}} investigator {{who runs}} a large conventional detective agency in Manhattan. Wolfe sometimes subcontracts to Bascom when he {{needs a lot of}} men for <b>something</b> (<b>as</b> in The Silent Speaker).|$|E
25|$|The {{donation}} of backpacks in Gunma last year moved me deeply. My heart skipped a beat when I heard the news. Thinking I might do <b>something</b> <b>as</b> well, I offer these gifts. May the Tiger Mask movement live on.|$|E
25|$|If a girl {{runs away}} or dies, {{she must be}} {{replaced}} by another girl from the family. Some girls in ritual servitude are {{the third or fourth}} girl in their family suffering for the same crime, sometimes for <b>something</b> <b>as</b> minor as the loss of trivial property.|$|E

60|$|For {{the first}} time he saw the war <b>as</b> <b>something</b> measurable, <b>as</b> <b>something</b> with a {{beginning}} and an end, <b>as</b> <b>something</b> less than the immortal spirit in man. He had been too much oppressed by it. He perceived all these people in the street were too much oppressed by it. He wanted to tell them as much, tell them that all was well with them, bid them be of good cheer. He wanted to bless them. He found his arm floating up towards gestures of benediction. Self-control became increasingly difficult.|$|R
25|$|In the Weekly Maqam, Sephardi Jews {{each week}} base {{the songs of}} the {{services}} {{on the content of}} that week's parashah. For parashah Vayikra, Sephardi Jews apply Maqam Rast, the maqam that shows a beginning or an initiation of <b>something,</b> <b>as</b> with this parashah, Jews begin the book of Leviticus.|$|E

The term insoluble is often applied to poorly or very poorly soluble compounds. A common threshold to describe <b>something</b> <b>as</b> insoluble {{is less than}} 0.1 g per 100 mL of solvent.|$|E
25|$|The {{home team}} for each Discovery Series is {{determined}} by better win percentage, with head-to-head record as the primary tiebreaker. This {{is part of the}} reason why teams in the same conference, but opposite divisions, play each other an odd number (seven) of regular-season games. <b>Something</b> <b>as</b> important as postseason home-field advantage does not come down to run differential or a coin flip.|$|E
50|$|Connivance is {{the act of}} conniving or conspiring, {{especially}} {{with the knowledge of}} and active or passive consent to wrongdoing or a twist in truth, to make <b>something</b> appear <b>as</b> <b>something</b> that it is not.|$|R

25|$|After the Justine {{story and}} the deaths of Ryan and Frankie, AW took a serious blow creatively. Frankie {{was one of the}} show's most beloved characters, Ryan and Vicky had been the show's most popular couple, and it had never done <b>something</b> <b>as</b> outlandish as a doppelgänger before. The show {{continued}} to decline creatively, which eventually led to its demise.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, it was {{the bright}} colours and {{flamboyant}} nature of the uniform that attracted men to the army. The chance to wear <b>something</b> <b>as</b> distinctive as the regimental red could be extremely tempting; a new and vivid uniform {{would have been a}} welcome change from the drab colours worn by most men in everyday society and soldiers frequently drew interest from admiring women.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{the use of}} radial {{engines in}} {{land-based}} fighters was relatively rare in Europe, as {{it was believed that}} their large frontal area would cause too much drag on <b>something</b> <b>as</b> small as a fighter. Tank was not convinced of this, having witnessed the successful use of radial engines by the U.S. Navy, and felt a properly streamlined installation would eliminate this problem.|$|E
5000|$|He {{also spoke}} out against reform of anti-homosexual laws, once stating [...] "The proper {{way to look at}} {{homosexuality}} is to regard it not <b>as</b> <b>something</b> separate but <b>as</b> <b>something</b> to which any of us can succumb if the circumstances of our lives or the weakness of our outlook make us susceptible." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{distinction}} between liberalism and republicanism lies basically {{on the way}} politics is conceived: <b>as</b> <b>something</b> instrumental or <b>as</b> <b>something</b> constitutive of the practical condition of the human being. This constitutive conception of politics is {{the very essence of}} republicanism. All other features of republicanism stem from this, receiving from it their specific republican meaning...|$|R
5000|$|The Lemonade Principle. Entrepreneurs {{will look}} at how to {{leverage}} contingencies. Surprises are not necessarily seen <b>as</b> <b>something</b> bad, but <b>as</b> opportunities to find new markets.|$|R
25|$|Spot-fixing {{refers to}} illegal {{activity}} {{in a sport}} in which a specific aspect of a game, unrelated to the final result but upon which a betting market exists, is fixed {{in an attempt to}} ensure a certain result in a proposition bet; examples include <b>something</b> <b>as</b> minor as timing a no ball or wide delivery in cricket, or timing the first throw-in or corner in association football.|$|E
25|$|The {{children}} {{access the}} virtual world through Internet-connected visors, which they refer to as megane, the usual term for protective or corrective eyeglasses. The visors allow them to see virtual reality superimposed on objective reality. To visually confirm <b>something</b> <b>as</b> virtual, the children often lift their visors from their eyes. The visors also work in conjunction with futuristic ear monitors placed behind the ear, which allow the wearer to hear sounds from the virtual environment.|$|E
25|$|Moore's {{scenario}} remains untested. Addressing historical developments when DC reissued the work, he noted:Naïveté {{can also}} be detected in my supposition {{that it would take}} <b>something</b> <b>as</b> melodramatic as a near-miss nuclear conflict to nudge Britain towards fascism... The simple fact that much of the historical background of the story proceeds from a predicted Conservative defeat in the 1983 General Election should tell you how reliable we were in our roles as Cassandras.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} so many Gerzean sites are at the mouths of wadis which lead to the Red Sea may {{indicate}} some amount of trade via the Red Sea (though Byblian trade potentially could have crossed the Sinai and then taken to the Red Sea). Also, it is considered unlikely that <b>something</b> <b>as</b> complicated as recessed panel architecture could have worked its way into Egypt by proxy, and at least a small contingent of migrants is often suspected.|$|E
25|$|Medications and {{treatments}} {{are said to}} have a palliative effect if they relieve symptoms without having a curative effect on the underlying disease or cause. This can include treating nausea related to chemotherapy or <b>something</b> <b>as</b> simple as morphine to treat the pain of broken leg or ibuprofen to treat aching related to an influenza (flu) infection. Although the concept of palliative care is not new, most physicians have traditionally concentrated on trying to cure people.|$|E
25|$|Winston {{describes}} <b>something</b> <b>as</b> {{simple as}} the repair {{of a broken}} pane of glass as requiring committee approval that can take several years and so most of those living {{in one of the}} blocks usually do the repairs themselves (Winston himself is called in by Mrs. Parsons to repair her blocked sink). All Outer Party residences include telescreens that serve both as outlets for propaganda and to monitor the Party members; they can be turned down, but they cannot be turned off.|$|E
