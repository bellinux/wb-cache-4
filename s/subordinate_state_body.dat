40|$|Sub{{constitutional}}ism {{refers to}} two-tiered constitutional systems where a superior {{state and a}} group of <b>subordinate</b> <b>states</b> exercise overlapping control of a single population. Federalism is a familiar version of subconstitutionalism but scholarship on federalism focuses on the design of the superior state 2 ̆ 7 s constitution. Our focus is the design of the <b>subordinate</b> <b>state</b> 2 ̆ 7 s constitution. Our question is, how does the constitution of an independent state change when it becomes <b>subordinate</b> to another <b>state</b> in a federalist or related subconstitutional system? Applying agency theory, we argue that because the superior state reduces agency costs as between the <b>subordinate</b> <b>state</b> 2 ̆ 7 s government and its population, and because constitutional limits are best justified as means for reducing agency costs, it follows that <b>subordinate</b> <b>state</b> constitutions, or subconstitutions, should impose weaker restrictions on government (such as separation of powers), weaker rights protections, and weaker amendment procedures. We discuss evidence from the American states, the European Union, and the federalist systems of other countries...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{explorations of}} {{hierarchy}} {{in international relations}} have restricted their domain of inquiry to states as aggregate units. Although this has greatly en-hanced our understanding of international politics, we know less about what the implications of hierarchy are for domestic politics in <b>subordinate</b> <b>states.</b> Because of the varieties of domestic political control- including violence- employed by great powers, opening up the black box of <b>subordinate</b> <b>state</b> politics can yield {{new insights into the}} operations and limits of international hierarchy. Here I outline a theory of political incentivization and link it to a discussion of foreign-imposed regime change, arguing that great powers stabilize politics in <b>subordinate</b> <b>states</b> directly by bolstering preferred regimes and indirectly by threatening to intervene and remove leaders who challenge the status quo. ii...|$|R

50|$|In Ancient East Asia, Chinese hegemony existed {{during the}} Spring and Autumn period (c. 770-480 BCE), when the {{weakened}} {{rule of the}} Eastern Zhou Dynasty led to the relative autonomy of the Five Hegemons (Ba in Chinese 霸). They were appointed by feudal lord conferences, and thus were nominally obliged to uphold the imperium of the Zhou Dynasty over the <b>subordinate</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many empires {{have set}} up vassal states, based on tribes, kingdoms, or city-states, the {{subjects}} of which they wish to control without having to conquer or directly govern them. In these cases a <b>subordinate</b> <b>state</b> (such as a dependency, suzerainty, residency or protectorate) has retained internal autonomy, but has lost independence in foreign policy, while and, in many instances, formal tribute.|$|R
50|$|In {{philosophy}} and in sociology, the term cultural hegemony has denotations and connotations {{derived from the}} Ancient Greek word ἡγεμονία (hegemonia) indicating leadership and rule. In politics, hegemony is the geopolitical method of indirect imperial dominance, with which the hegemon (leader <b>state)</b> rules <b>subordinate</b> <b>states,</b> {{by the threat of}} intervention, an implied means of power, rather than by direct military force, that is, invasion, occupation, and annexation.|$|R

The research uses Lesotho as a case study of a <b>subordinate</b> <b>state</b> in relation to the Republic of South Africa (RSA) as a hegemonic state.

40|$|Five {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to understand the impact of nature exposure on body image.

In Study 4, British community participants went on a walk in a natural or built environment, with results indicating that the walk in a natural environment resulted in significantly higher <b>state</b> <b>body</b> appreciation, whereas the walk in a built environment resulted in significantly lower scores. In Study 5, British participants were recruited as they were entering a designed green space on their own volition. Results indicated that spending time in the green space led to improved <b>state</b> <b>body</b> appreciation.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that athletes and {{physically}} active persons are generally more satisfied with their bodies than sedentary people, physical activity seems to exert both negative and positive influences on body image. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of a single session of exercise in <b>state</b> <b>body</b> image modification. In particular, we observed if a single session of sport or fitness activity could have a positive influence on <b>state</b> <b>body</b> image, considered as an episodic, evaluative and affective perception of the own physical appearance. Results showed an increase of the mean <b>state</b> <b>body</b> image rate (assessed with the <b>Body</b> Image <b>States</b> Scales, BISS) after a one-hour session of sport or fitness activities in a sample of 295 individuals.

40|$|To date, {{there has}} been limited {{empirical}} scrutiny of the correlates and consequences of day-to-day <b>state</b> <b>body</b> dissatisfaction fluctuations within naturalistic contexts. We used ecological momentary assessment (a form of naturalistic observation) to evaluate whether <b>state</b> <b>body</b> dissatisfaction was concurrently and/or prospectively associated with occurrence and quality of social interactions. Women (N = 121), aged 18 to 40, completed a brief trait-based survey and then nominated a 7 -day period within which to receive seven text messages daily, at random intervals, prompting them to complete measures of body dissatisfaction at that moment. If they were currently or had recently engaged in social interactions, they {{were also asked to}} fill out questions rating the quality of these interactions (operationalized in terms of enjoyment of, and control in, the interaction). Findings suggest that the relationship between <b>state</b> <b>body</b> dissatisfaction and aspects of social interactions is complex and may vary over time. Cross-sectionally, <b>state</b> <b>body</b> dissatisfaction and social interaction quality were negatively associated. Prospectively, however, body dissatisfaction predicted subsequent avoidance of social interactions. Interestingly, when women chose to avoid social interactions, their body dissatisfaction worsened, yet when they did engage in social interactions, they reported improved body satisfaction. Importantly, the links between <b>state</b> <b>body</b> dissatisfaction and social interactions may be moderated by body mass index and trait body satisfaction levels. Potential mechanisms underlying the association between <b>state</b> <b>body</b> dissatisfaction and quality and quantity of social interactions are discussed, and future research avenues are proposed to further understand their inter-relation...|$|R
