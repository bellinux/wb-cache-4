Experiments {{have been conducted}} in the GALCIT Supersonic Shear Layer Facility to investigate some aspects of mass injection in <b>subsonic</b> <b>diffusers.</b> The goal of the experiment is to study aerodynamic control in <b>subsonic</b> <b>diffusers</b> by investigating downstream velocity profiles. These experiments were designed to address several key issues like effects due to velocity change (for one-stream and two-stream flows), and effects due to density variation. The effect of the separation bubble (stall flow) {{on the performance of}} the diffuser has also been investigated. One-stream experiments were performed with non-reacting (cold) runs using [ [...] . ] in the high-speed section at different velocities and zero velocity at the low-speed section. Detailed analysis of data obtained shows a slight dependency of the reattachment point of the separation bubble on Reynolds number. As the flow rate in the high-speed section increases, the reattachment point of the separation bubble shifted slightly downstream. Two-stream flow (low- and high-speed sections) experiments were performed using [ [...] . ] in the high-speed section and a density-matched mixture of Argon/Helium in the low-speed section. As the mass injection is increased in the low-speed section, the reattachment point of the separation bubble moved further downstream. While keeping the same velocity ratio (low- and high-speed sections), as the overall flow velocity increases, the reattachment point moved further downstream. Also, experiments with a higher density ratio using Argon in the low-speed section and [ [...] . ] in the high-speed section were performed. As the density of the low-speed section increases, the reattachment point of the separation bubble moved upstream due to shear-layer entrainment effect. Finally, as the reattachment point of the separation bubble shifted further downstream, the diffuser pressure coefficient decreases, therefore, the performance of the diffuser is degraded.

A potential flow analysis was made, and a digital computer program {{was written for}} determining the diffuser wall contour for prescribed boundary conditions.

One bell shaped diffuser and three annular diffusers with area ratios of either 2. 5 : 1 or 3 : 1 were designed, fabricated, and tested. Minimum suction requirements of metastable operation ranged from 6. 3 percent to 12 percent when operating with inlet air velocities in the 1000 to 250 ft/sec (30 to 76 m/sec) range. For stable operation suction rates from 10 percent to 22 percent were required. In all cases the diffuser effectiveness was above 95 percent based on the conventional definition, and from 81 percent to 94 percent when the suction loss was accounted for.

40|$|The {{effect of}} missile {{armament}} {{on the performance}} of an interceptor-type aircraft model has been determined at Mach numbers 1. 5, 1. 7, and 1. 9 and at angles of attack to 19 deg. With this configuration missiles were carried in a bay located {{on the bottom of the}} aircraft fuselage and mounted to a rotatable missile door. Rotation of the door then brought the missiles into the external or firing position. The aircraft model was characterized by triangular-shaped normal-shock inlets located at the wing roots. Relatively short and curved <b>subsonic</b> <b>diffusers</b> fed simulated twin side-by-side turbojet engines. Inasmuch as the missile bay extended considerably ahead of the inlet station, rotation of the missile door created considerable disturbance of the flow entering the inlets. In comparison with the internal missile arrangement, the external missile configurations increased the model lift, drag, and pitching moment. While the diffuser-exit flow distortion and static-pressure fluctuations were not greatly affected, diffuser total-pressure recovery was reduced as much as 0. 058 at Mach number 1. 9 for one missile configuration. The most detrimental effect of missile-door rotation occurred at the transient door positions, or with the door halfwzy between the missiles-in and -out conditions. At this door position the flow into the inlets was highly asymmetrical. Although the performance of both left and right ducts was generally reduced, the inlet duct on the cavity side of the missile door was most severely penalized, becoming unstable recovery losses and increases in flow distortion. The installation of fuselage fences along the missile bay was only partially effective in reducing these losses...|$|R

When the aircraft accelerated past Mach 1.6, an internal jackscrew moved the spike up to 26 in inwards, directed by an analog air inlet computer that took into account pitot-static system, pitch, roll, yaw, and angle of attack. Moving the spike tip drew the shock wave riding on it closer to the inlet cowling until it touched just slightly inside the cowling lip. This position reflected the spike shock-wave repeatedly between the spike centerbody and the inlet inner cowl sides, and minimized airflow spillage which is the cause of spillage drag.

Anisotropic inlet free-stream turbulence with the eddy axis perpendicular to the flow and parallel to the diverging walls of the diffuser appears to be more effective at transmitting energy to the diverging walls of the diffuser, thereby improving diffuser performance, as compared to isotropic turbulence or anisotropic turbulence with the eddy axis perpendicular to the diverging walls of the diffuser. The pressure recovery of the diffuser was found to be strongly dependent upon the inlet free-stream total turbulence intensity, was independent of eddy size for large eddy dimensions, and was dependent upon eddy size for small eddy dimensions.

40|$|Abstract—Due to adverse {{pressure}} gradient along the diverging walls of wide-angled diffusers, the attached flow separates from one wall and remains attached permanently {{to the other}} wall in a process called stalling. Stalled diffusers render the whole fluid flow system, {{in which they are}} part of, very inefficient. There is then an engineering need to try to understand the whole process of diffuser stall if any meaningful attempts to improve on diffuser efficiency are to be made. In this regard, this paper provides a data bank contribution for the mean flow-field in wide-angled diffusers where the complete velocity and static pressure fields, and pressure recovery data for diffusers in the fully stalled flow regime are experimentally measured. The measurements were carried out at Reynolds numbers between 1. 07 × 10 5 and 2. 14 × 10 5 based on inlet hydraulic diameter and centreline velocity for diffusers whose divergence angles were between 30 ◦ and 50 ◦. Variation of Reynolds number did not significantly affect the velocity and static pressure profiles. The wall static pressure recovery was found to be more sensitive to changes in the Reynolds number. By increasing the velocity from 10 m/s to 20 m/s, the wall static pressure recovery increased by 8. 31 %. However, as the divergence angle was increased, a similar increase in the Reynolds number resulted in a higher percentage increase in pressure recovery. Experimental results showed that regardless of the wall to which the flow was attached, both the velocity and pressure fields were replicated with discrepancies below 2 %.

Flow and heat transfer studies were made at total divergence angles ranging from 0 to 45 degrees, at diffuser wall length to throat ratios ranging from 6 to 18, and at Reynolds numbers based on throat velocity and throat width ranging from approximately 40, 000 to 300, 000. Flow studies were made using wool-yarn tufts and a smoke generator. Flow regimes developed were: no "appreciable" separation, large transitory stall, and fully-developed two-dimensional stall. Velocity measurements were made for fully-developed two-dimensional stall. Steady-state heat transfer measurements were obtained with 23 electrically heated spot heaters mounted in the isothermal wall. Only one of the diffuser walls was heated to an isothermal condition. The other walls and the diffuser entrance sections were adiabatic. Results indicated that the total divergence angle, the ratio of wall length to throat width, and inlet turbulence level had the greatest effect on establishment of flow regimes. Flow patterns were found to be in general agreement with those observed by Waitman, Reneau, and Kline. Heat transfer results for round entrances agreed substantially with those of VanSant. Heat transfer rates for all entrances tested were greatest when the angle of divergence was 0 degrees. When the angle was increased, the heat transfer rates decreased. For the configurations tested, heat transfer rates were greater for reentrant than square entrances. Heat transfer rates from square entranced diffusers were equal to or slightly greater than those with round entrances depending on the flow regime...|$|R

The vortex generators studied were rectangular vanes arranged in counter-rotating and co-rotating arrays. The vane geometric factors of interest included height, length, spacing, angle-of-incidence, and positions upstream and downstream of the inlet terminal shock. The flow through the inlet was simulated numerically through {{the solution of the}} steady-state, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations on multi-block, structured grids using the Wind-US flow solver. The vanes were simulated using a vortex generator model. The inlet performance was characterized by the inlet total pressure recovery and the radial and circumferential total pressure distortion indices at the engine face. Design of experiments and statistical analysis methods were applied to quantify the effect of the geometric factors of the vanes and search for optimal vane arrays.

For the low-speed testing, a drooped lip was employed to improve the inlet performance at a high angle of attack.

The results from the low-speed performance test were compared with the results from a previous test program on the same inlet with a long <b>subsonic</b> <b>diffuser</b> (dl/d = 4. 5). The comparison indicates that inlet recovery was not affected by the use of the short diffuser for either the baseline (no droop) or the drooped cowl lip configuration.

A comparison of the two configurations with a 70 deg drooped lip showed no significant difference in distortion. For the portion of the experimental program in which diffuser conditions for high-speed flight were simulated, diffuser-induced flow separation occurred. This separation was predicted from an analytical study that used the Hess potential flow panel method and the Herring two-dimensional boundary-layer analysis computer codes.

Preliminary deceleration of incoming airflow and boundary layer control are provided {{by means of a}} swept wedge placed in front of inlet due to forming transverse pressure gradient. Further compression is realized in a system of 3 -D shocks with terminal normal one. Numerical modeling based on solution of 3 -D Navier-Stokes equations allowed obtaining the results of inlet flow at throttle modes under M∞= 0. 8 - 1. 8 and confirmed flow stability at 1. 5 [...] 5 -fold increased pressure in <b>subsonic</b> <b>diffuser</b> outlet section in comparison with external free stream pressure. Parametric flow calculations are organized and inlet throttle performance is determined with <b>subsonic</b> <b>diffuser</b> at M∞= 0. 8 - 1. 8 and boundary layer suction in a throat. It is received that using the boundary layer control with air suction rate Gsuct/Ginlet = 2 … 5 % the total pressure recovery coefficient σ grows up to σ = 0. 89 … 0. 97 for considered M ∞ range.
