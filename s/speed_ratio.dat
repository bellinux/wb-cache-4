25|$|It is {{impossible}} to say with any certainty how many or even which of his inventions passed into general and practical use, and thereby had impact over {{the lives of many}} people. Among those inventions that are credited with passing into general practical use are the strut bridge, the automated bobbin winder, the rolling mill, the machine for testing the tensile strength of wire and the lens-grinding machine pictured at right. In the lens-grinding machine, the hand rotation of the grinding wheel operates an angle-gear, which rotates a shaft, turning a geared dish in which sits the glass or crystal to be ground.

25|$|Hobbing uses a {{hobbing machine}} with two skew spindles, one mounted {{with a blank}} {{workpiece}} {{and the other with}} the hob. The angle between the hob's spindle (axis) and the workpiece's spindle varies, {{depending on the type of}} product being produced. For example, if a spur gear is being produced, then the hob is angled equal to the helix angle of the hob; if a helical gear is being produced then the angle must be increased by the same amount as the helix angle of the helical gear. The two shafts are rotated at a proportional ratio, which determines the number of teeth on the blank; for example, for a single-threaded hob if the gear ratio is 40:1 the hob rotates 40 times to each turn of the blank, which produces 40 teeth in the blank. If the hob has multiple threads the <b>speed</b> <b>ratio</b> must be multiplied by the number of threads on the hob. The hob is then fed up into the workpiece until the correct tooth depth is obtained. Finally the hob is fed through the workpiece parallel to the blank's axis of rotation.|$|E
25|$|For a time, {{the future}} of {{composite}} baseball bats at the collegiate level was in question. On July 22, 2009, the NCAA reported that the rules committee had requested to ban the use of composite bats. The NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel found that 20 out of the 25 composite bats tested during the 2009 NCAA Division 1 Baseball Tournament failed the BESR (Ball Exit <b>Speed</b> <b>Ratio)</b> test. The tests showed that the balls were actually coming off the bat much quicker than what the specifications allowed. Since bats must pass the BESR specification at the factory before reaching the market, there are two possible hypotheses. One suggests that the performance of composite bats increases with repeated use; the other states that players are intentionally altering the composite bat. The most common method of altering composite bats is through bat rolling, where {{a large amount of}} pressure is applied, by various means, while rolling the bat back and forth. The rules committee met on August 17, 2009, to discuss their proposal with manufacturers, and on August 24, the NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel approved a temporary ban on composite bats. During this temporary ban, the rules committee will continue testing the bats to determine if the performance is enhanced through repetitive use, or if intentional alteration seems more plausible. Currently, the NCAA is requiring that all composite bats meet BBCOR standards. See the Design section above for details.|$|E

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{behavior of}} a {{vertical axis wind turbine}} (VAWT) is analyzed by means of 2 D particle image velocimetry (PIV), focusing on the development of dynamic stall at different tip <b>speed</b> <b>ratios.</b> The VAWT has an unsteady aerodynamic behavior due to the variation with the azimuth angle ¿ of the blade's sections' angle of attack, perceived velocity and Reynolds number. The phenomenon of dynamic stall is then an inherent effect of the operation of a VAWT at low tip <b>speed</b> <b>ratios,</b> impacting both loads and power. The present work is driven by the need to understand this phenomenon, by visualizing and quantifying it, and to create a database for model validation.
