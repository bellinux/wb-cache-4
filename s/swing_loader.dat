50|$|A <b>swing</b> <b>loader</b> is a {{rigid frame}} loader with a {{swinging}} boom. The boom can swing 180 degrees or more. Swingloaders are primarily {{used by the}} railroad industry to lay rail. Like other loaders many attachments can {{be attached to the}} boom such as magnets, forks, and buckets. Smaller swingloaders are used in farming applications for loading out. A swinging boom is advantageous where space is limited. The loader is able to lift on all sides and dump off on all sides.|$|E
5000|$|Self-propelled {{on-track}} {{steel and}} rubber tired [...] "Hy-Rail" [...] equipment {{can also be}} employed to remove snow from railroad tracks. The Pettibone Speed <b>Swing</b> <b>loader</b> and similar machines, both with and without hyrail wheels can be fitted with a large capacity snow bucket or a wedge plow to clear the tracks. Ballast regulators, machines designed to shape {{the profile of the}} crushed stone ballast that anchors the track in place, can be used without modification or refitted with purpose built snow blades, blowers and wings to clear snow from the right of way.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study done}} on swinging and processing whole tree, tree length and log length pieces in a smallwood Douglas-fir thinning. Two machines were evaluated, a 70 horsepower rubber tired skidder and a hydraulic loader mounted on a 6 x 4 live tandem truck. The study {{took place in the}} foothills of the Coast Range in western Oregon. The stand averaged 217 trees/acre and 15 ft 3 /tree. Skidder and <b>loader</b> <b>swinging</b> occurred on rock surfaced truck roads. Both the loader and skidder were analyzed using work sampling and detailed time study techniques. Regression analysis was used to develop an equation to predict delay free turn time for the skidder. The whole tree/tree length skidder operation produced 2. 74 cunits/scheduled hour at 16. 45 /cunit for a two man crew and 22. 61 /cunit for a three man crew. There was no difference in production rates. A comparable two man log length operation produced 3. 41 cunits/scheduled hour at 23. 51 /cunit. This higher cost included limbing and bucking done at the stump. The whole tree/tree length loader operation produced 3. 21 cunits/scheduled hour at 16. 15 /cunit. Crew interaction was evaluated using work sanipling. For the skidder operation, interference was nonexistent, the equivalent of almost one man was idle (93. 8...|$|R
40|$|The New York at {{the opening}} of the present war was one of the {{battleship}}s of the Atlantic Fleet in charge of Admiral Henry T. Mayo and was in the outer line of defense. This battleship was built in 1911 at a cost of $ 6, 400,-o 8 o. It has a displacement of 27, 000 tons, a speed of 21 knots, and an armament of 10 14 -inch and 21 5 -inch guns, and 4 torpedo tubes. It carries 55 officers and 970 men. The 14 -inch guns are of course more powerful than the 5 -inch ones. The barrel of one of these large guns weighs 64 tons. If a wagon could be built strong enough to hold the gun, it would take 6 o horses to haul it. The gun is 4 feet across its big end and 2 feet across the little end. The barrel is 52 1 / 2 feet long and its walls are 17 inches thick. It can shoot a shell weighing 1, 400 pounds a distance almost equal to that across the English Channel. The cost of each firing is. $ 780. 00. It requires 370 pounds of smokeless powder for each shell. In the picture you see a gun crew firing one of the 5 -inch guns of the New York. This gun takes a 60 -pound shell and a powder charge of about 20 pounds. The crew works with regularity and precision, each man having his own particular work to do. The trainer stands with eye at the telescope sight. The plugman opens and closes the br each. The <b>loaders</b> <b>swing</b> in the shell and powder charge. The sight-setter wears a telephone headpiece and gets orders as to range and direction from the spotter aloft. Every few seconds the crack of the gun can be heard as it discharges its shell...|$|R
5000|$|Like Australia, England had a rich seam of bowling {{talent in}} the 1950s, {{so much so that}} they left behind fast bowler Fred Trueman (average 21.57), off-spinner Jim Laker (21.24) and slow left armer Tony Lock (25.58) who between them had taken 15 wickets in the Ashes-winning Fifth Test at the Kennington Oval in 1953. The most likely {{explanation}} is that these outspoken cricketers were regarded as 'difficult tourists' by the MCC and Hutton thought that [...] "Fiery Fred" [...] had yet to mature as a bowler. As in every series since the war it looked like the England bowling would rest on the broad shoulders of Alex Bedser (24.89)â€”in 1954 his 231 wickets was the greatest haul in Test history. His lethal combination of in-swingers and leg-cutters had taken 30 wickets (at 16.06) on the 1950-51 tour and 39 wickets (at 17.48) in 1953. The unfortunate Bedser suffered from shingles, had seven catches dropped off him in the First Test, where he was hit for 1/131, was dropped and never got back into the side. He took to bowling to the Australian team in the nets and Keith Miller told him [...] "You're not too bad for a Test discard. If you want a game you can come over and play with us". In the last four Tests Hutton relied on the formidable bowling attack of Frank Tyson (18.76), Brian Statham (24.84), Trevor Bailey (29.21), Johnny Wardle (20.39) and Bob Appleyard (17.87). While [...] "Typhoon" [...] Tyson is justly famed for simply blasting the opposition away, the nagging accuracy of Statham and Bailey and the increasing spin of Wardle and Appleyard all served to tie down and frustrate the Australian batsmen. In fact the spinners took wickets with a faster strike rate (1 wicket every 57 balls) and at a lower average (21.57) than the fast bowlers. Like Simpson the fast <b>swing</b> bowler Peter <b>Loader</b> (22.51) thought that he should have played in the Tests and was unlucky not to do so. Big Jim McConnon also had a bad tour, he was never really seen as an adequate alternative for Jim Laker, didn't find his form and was sent home early after a couple of painful injuries. Bill Edrich had opened the England bowling before the war, but rarely bowled in the 1950s. Len Hutton, Tom Graveney and Colin Cowdrey were part-time leg-spinners who were only really used in up-country games.|$|R
