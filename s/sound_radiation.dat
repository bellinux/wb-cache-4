The {{aim is to}} study the near field unsteady flow and its noise radiation. For this purpose, the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations were solved with a 4 th-order optimized pre-factored compact finite difference scheme for spatial derivatives and a 4 - 6 alternating stage low-dissipation, low-dispersion Runge-Kutta scheme for time integration. The length to depth ratio of the cavity is 2 and the length to width ratio is 1. The simulations were performed at a Mach number of 0. 4 and a Reynolds number of 60, 000 based on the depth of cavity. To compute the turbulent flow field, the Spalart-Allmaras one-equation turbulence model was employed with Detached Eddy Simulation (DES). The Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation was solved to estimate the far field acoustic radiation. In both cases, the flow oscillations were found to follow the Rossiter flow model.

In addition, the Inverse Boundary Element Method (IBEM) can be used, given sufficient computational resources. Unfortunately, none of these methods directly guides the changes necessary to reduce noise radiation. Radiation mode analysis has previously been primarily associated with forward prediction of radiated <b>sound</b> power. Since <b>radiation</b> modes contribute independently to <b>sound</b> power <b>radiation,</b> it is only necessary to modify the surface vibration so that it does not strongly couple with those modes in order to ensure sound power reduction. Since the radiation modes can be used as the basis functions through which the surface motion of a source can be described, an inverse method based on radiation modes allows the surface vibration that results in the majority of the radiated sound power to be identified unequivocally, and so will, in turn, guide the design changes needed to reduce radiated sound power...|$|R

The results show that: 1) The {{location of}} point excitation force has much influence to <b>sound</b> <b>radiation</b> power insertion loss; 2) The average <b>sound</b> <b>radiation</b> power insertion loss is closer to convergence as the number of point excitation force becomes larger; 3) When The location of point excitation force is closer to the corner of plate, <b>sound</b> <b>radiation</b> power insertion loss compares well with that of multi-point average.

50|$|A {{theoretical}} basis for computation {{of the end}} correction is the radiation acoustic impedance of a circular piston. This impedance represents the ratio of acoustic pressure at the piston, divided by the flow rate induced by it. The air speed is typically assumed to be uniform across the tube end.
