This {{paper is}} {{essentially}} a discussion of results found in the paper “Two <b>sufficient</b> conditions <b>for</b> a graphic sequence to have a realization with prescribed clique size ” written by Jian-Hua Yin and Jiong-Sheng Li. We first define {{what is meant by}} a graphic sequence, then offer a few necessary and <b>sufficient</b> conditions <b>for</b> a sequence to be graphic. Next we establish some <b>sufficient</b> conditions <b>for</b> sequences to have graphic realizations with prescribed clique sizes, as well as <b>sufficient</b> conditions <b>for</b> realizations that are one edge shy of containing a clique of predetermined size. Finally we use the theorems developed over the course of this paper to prove a number of recent results. Contents 1. Background 2 2.

5|$|However, some eusocial {{species such}} as {{termites}} are not haplodiploid. Conversely, all bees are haplodiploid but not all are eusocial, and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males, creating half-sisters that share only 25% of their genes. Haplodiploidy is thus neither necessary nor <b>sufficient</b> <b>for</b> eusociality. But, monogamy (queens mating singly) is the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated, so {{it is likely that}} haplodiploidy contributed to the evolution of eusociality in bees.|$|E
