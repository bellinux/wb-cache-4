2500|$|The {{incident}} is noted as being {{further evidence of}} a trend of live-streaming confrontations between citizens (specifically, African Americans) and police in the United States. A senior ACLU attorney questioned the request by Baltimore County police to shut down Gaines' accounts, and Facebook's decision to comply, stating that Facebook must exercise caution when dealing with requests by police to censor content. Artist and journalist, Ferrari Sheppard also criticized Facebook's involvement in the incident on Twitter, saying [...] "Facebook helped Baltimore police kill #KorrynGaines in the dark." [...] The corporate watchdog group SumOfUs criticised Facebook for setting a precedent of censorship by orders of police, stating that the move {{is a threat to}} civil liberties, owing to the current use of <b>shareable</b> video on social media as an instrument in exposing police violence in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Wittgenstein {{argues that}} {{definitions}} emerge {{from what he}} termed [...] "forms of life", roughly the culture and society {{in which they are}} used. Wittgenstein stresses the social aspects of cognition; to see how language works for most cases, we have to see how it functions in a specific social situation. It is this emphasis on becoming attentive to the social backdrop against which language is rendered intelligible that explains Wittgenstein's elliptical comment that [...] "If a lion could talk, we could not understand him." [...] However, in proposing the thought experiment involving the fictional character, Robinson Crusoe, a captain shipwrecked on a desolate island [...] with no other inhabitant, Wittgenstein shows that language is not in all cases a social phenomenon (although, they are for most cases); instead the criterion for a language is grounded in a set of interrelated normative activities: teaching, explanations, techniques and criteria of correctness. In short, it is essential that a language is <b>shareable,</b> but this does not imply that for a language to function that it is in fact already shared.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{services}} that AT aggressively promotes is its Rollover Minutes service, which allows customers to keep unused minutes from month to month on a twelve-month rolling cycle on its popular nationwide plans. Beginning in July 2007, AT allows its AT Unity plan users to have Rollover, a service which was exclusive to the Nation plans. AT also launched video share in 2007, in which a mobile caller can stream live video from one phone to another over the 3G network with video share capable phones. This allows one mobile phone user to view video from another user's camera through the mobile phone in real time. AT also had A-list, similar to former competitor Alltel's program launched on April 20, 2006 branded [...] "My Circle." [...] AT rolled out the A-list program on September 20, 2009. Customers with individual Nation plans of $59.99 or higher could use A-List with Rollover to select up to five domestic phone numbers to call anytime—including landlines and wireless numbers on any network—without using any of the minutes in their plan. FamilyTalk customers with plans of $89.99 or more could select up to ten numbers which any person in the FamilyTalk plan can call {{as much as they}} want. Effective September 1, 2011, the A-List feature is no longer available to new consumer and IRU customers. Existing customers who had A-List on their account prior to September 1, 2011, are able to keep the feature as long as they stay on a qualifying rate plan. As of October 25, 2013 AT no longer offers Nation Plans or Family Talk Plans to its new customers. New customers are now required to have one of AT Mobile Share Value plans which include unlimited Talk, Text and a <b>shareable</b> bucket of data start at $45 for a smartphone. As of January 8, 2016 AT no longer offers 2 year contracts for subsidized smart phones to its consumer customers. Customers who currently have 2 year contracts are grandfathered, until they upgrade to a new device they will have to choose from AT's NEXT installment plans for smartphones. AT has also reintroduced unlimited data plans for its customers who also have either AT U-verse or AT's newly acquired DirecTV. Unlimited data plans may be speed throttled after 22 GB of data have been used. With the inclusion of these new plans AT has also introduced a free roaming in Mexico feature for its postpaid customers.|$|E
