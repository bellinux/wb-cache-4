6000|$|When {{we reached}} the White House and I was shaking hands with the President, he <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> but I {{interrupted}} him and said: ...|$|E
60|$|The girl <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> and at {{the same}} instant there came faintly to them from the {{mainland}} the sound of hoarse shouting, and of shots.|$|E
60|$|Old Granny Fox <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> unpleasant. Then {{she changed}} her mind and instead she sat down and told Bobby Coon all her troubles. As she talked, Bobby Coon kept ducking his head behind a branch of the tree to hide a smile. Finally Granny Fox noticed it.|$|E
60|$|Corky was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> {{when the}} door opened, and the uncle came in.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Would he!' said Jim grimly. 'Well, I got {{the chance}} just now. Thompson said {{something}} to him, and he spun round, saw me, and shouted [...] "Thomson". I went up and capped him, and he was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> when he seemed to change his mind, and instead of confessing everything, he took me by the arm, and said, [...] "No, no, Thomson. Go away. It's nothing. I will send for you later."' ...|$|R
50|$|He {{loves to}} sleep, loves to droll, and rarely talks, {{but when he}} <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> in that fairly slow speed, those simple words always reveals the reality and the truth. Usually {{he seems to be}} lazy and casual, nothing could ever {{surprise}} him. However, when trapped in dangerous situations, he would become ferocious in a second and get ready to fight. Once the alert canceled, he would go back to that sleepy face again. In addition, his loyalty to Hong Lie cannot be doubted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Prudence, {{what does}} this mean?" [...] thundered Uncle Abimelech, as he flung the {{newspaper}} down on the table. Murray got up and peered over. Then he whistled. He <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> but remembered just in time and stopped. But he did give me a black look. Murray has a sneaking pride of name too, although he won't own up to it and laughs at Uncle Abimelech.|$|E
60|$|The boy {{flicked the}} big, boney horse with his whip and looked thoughtful. Then he <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to his little companion, {{but before he}} could speak the buggy began to sway dangerously from side to side and the earth seemed to rise up before them. Next minute there was a roar and a sharp crash, and at her side Dorothy saw the ground open in a wide crack and then come {{together}} again.|$|E
60|$|Just {{as he had}} {{commenced}} {{to speak}} the skeleton had put into his mouth a very large piece of turkey--very much larger in proportion than himself--and when Toby had finished speaking he <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> evidently not very complimentary to Mr. Lord. But what it was the company never knew; for just as {{he opened his mouth}} to speak, the food went down the wrong way, his face became a bright purple, and it was quite evident that he was choking.|$|E
50|$|Ilona Farkas (voiced by Atsuko Tanaka) - Iska Farkas' {{sister who}} got taken by Barbaros. Iska is always mumbling about Ilona {{and how he}} regrets not saving her. When Barbaros {{attacked}} Hungary, Iska fled but forgot Ilona. The Masked Emperor was {{made to look like}} her, revealed at the end of Soulcalibur Legends. Before his death, Iska <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> her, but it is cut off. Their graves are shown at the credits, showing that Ilona did die or at least had a headstone dedicated to her.|$|R
5000|$|Kashyap {{had wanted}} to make a film on the serial killer Raman Raghav, but the budget {{constraints}} did not allow him to make a period film set in the 1960s. He said that Raman Raghav 2.0 is not a biopic: [...] "This is actually inspired from him because that character is in the 1960s and this film is based in today’s times. It’s difficult because you’re <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> you’re treading a very dangerous line and you have your own sense of responsibility ... If it would’ve been a biopic it would have been 10 times more difficult." ...|$|R
5000|$|The musical starts when Sam Wheat and his long-time girlfriend, Molly Jensen, {{move into}} a loft {{apartment}} in Brooklyn together ("Here Right Now"). Sam is a banker, Molly a sculptor, and their friend Carl Bruner is introduced as one of Sam's co-workers, come to help them settle in. The three {{of them seem to}} be a tight-knit group, with Sam and Molly very much in love. However, Sam clearly shies away from the word [...] "love", which makes Molly visibly uncomfortable. She <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about it, but soon stops herself, and Sam distracts her with a rendition of [...] "Unchained Melody," [...] leaving her insecurities temporarily forgotten.|$|R
6000|$|... "Darn curious," [...] {{he muttered}} to himself, [...] "that boy should get caught just at this time, {{and not with}} some o' those girls in Marion. Well, it's none o' my funeral," [...] he ended, with a sigh; for it had stirred him {{to the bottom of}} his sunny nature, after all. A dozen times, as he lay there beside his equally sleepless companion, he <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> more in deprecation of the step, but each time stifled the opening word into a groan.|$|E
60|$|The {{behavior}} of the deer in the yard had puzzled Upton not a little. He could evolve no theory to account for it. Why at this season of the year should those two does have appeared so terror stricken at his approach, and why should the buck have been in such an ugly mood? From all accounts he had read, and from what Pat had said, he had had good grounds for expecting the animals to be fairly tame. He put the matter up to Pat as they tramped homeward, but his reply was evasive and unsatisfactory. In fact, the big fellow was not inclined to talk. He appeared to have something on his mind, and strode along with a black scowl darkening his usually good-humored face. Once Walter thought he detected a slight {{shake of his head}} at Sparrer as the latter <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> He was sure of it when the latter abruptly changed the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... “‘I {{was walking}} {{down one of the}} main streets of Jacksonville, looking into the shop windows, when what do you think? I saw Link Merwell and Nick Jasniff. You could have knocked me over with a feather, for I hadn’t {{imagined}} that they were anywhere near. They were nattily dressed and each carried a small valise, and they were buying caps and some other things for a sea voyage. I went into the shop and called to them, and my! both of them jumped as if they were shot, and Merwell got so pale I {{thought he was going to}} faint. I said “Hello,” but they didn’t answer to that, and Jasniff at once wanted to know if I was alone. When I told him I was he seemed mightily relieved, and Merwell looked relieved, too. They wanted to know what I was doing there and I told them. Then I asked what they were doing, but I couldn’t get any straight answer. Merwell <b>started</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about going to sea, but Jasniff stopped him short, and said they guessed they would go back to New York, where they had come from.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} Sunday, Rosalie notices some Catholic boys {{yelling and}} {{making fun of}} David. David scares the boys, however, and they run away. Norman notices and proceeds {{to have a conversation}} with Rosalie about David, explaining that David’s mother drowned when she was still young, and that it must be difficult for David. After the conversation, Rosalie’s brother, Freddie, his wife, Hazel, Rosalie’s sister Margaret, and her husband Cecil, and Martha arrive at the house. The family begins bantering about the children getting married, and Johnny is brought up. Norman <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about him, but notices Rosalie and simply states that she drew a nice picture of him. When Rosalie goes to bed, Norman comes to talk to her, as he always does, and avoids the subject of Johnny. Rosalie is relieved as she is having difficulties not telling Norman that she went the shipyard searching for Johnny.|$|R
40|$|In these notes, I {{will use}} the word “reasoning ” to refer to {{something}} people do. The general category includes both internal reasoning, reasoning things out by oneself—inference and deliberation—and external reasoning with others—arguing, discussing and negotiating. Accounts of reasoning of either sort can be either descriptive psychological theories that attempt to characterize something about how people actually infer, deliberate, and argue, or normative theories that attempt <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about how people ought to infer, deliberate and argue, or to characterize certain aspects of good or bad inference, deliberation, or argument. The word “reasoning ” {{can also be used}} to refer to a product of the process of reasoning. Something written down, for example. I don’t want to confuse the process with the product, so I here use “reasoning ” just for the process. The product of reasoning might be a linear sequence of sentences or propositions, perhaps in the form of a linear argument. It does not follow that the process of reasoning is linear. It almost certainly involves highly parallel processes of constraint satisfaction. 2 Logic, probability, and decision theory I need at the <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about the relevance of logic, probability, and decision theor...|$|R
5000|$|Sergei {{takes the}} boat on an {{unauthorized}} fishing trip {{for a few}} days, and tells him not to mention this. When the radio operator urgently requests to speak with Sergei, Pasha dutifully makes up excuses why he cannot come on the radio. Eventually Pasha is told to take down a radiogram that Sergei's wife and young son have been [...] "gravely injured" [...] in an accident, although it is apparent they've been killed. He is told that a ship is headed to get them and instructed to simply give Sergei the message and then [...] "leave him alone." [...] The sad news keeps Pasha awake, but when he does sleep he oversleeps; the data goes unrecorded. Seeing Sergei's boat, he hastily grabs the logbook to fill in fake numbers, {{and in doing so}} knocks his radiogram under the desk. When Sergei comes ashore with the trout, he is in a good mood. He tells Pasha a warm story about his wife craving salted trout during her pregnancy. Pasha <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> but Sergei interrupts and teaches him how to properly fillet a fish.|$|R
50|$|Arcola is {{also known}} for housing the world's only Hippie Memorial, created by Bob Moomaw. He died in 1998. He worked as a {{railroad}} clerk and tax assessor, but did not like either job. As an eccentric, independent artist with strong beliefs, {{he was able to}} give voice to his feelings, passions and opinions through his art and the writing on the sides of his buildings. He created the 62-foot-long artwork <b>starting</b> in 1992 <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about his life and the era during which he lived. A nearby marker gives an interpretation of his work.|$|R
6000|$|We {{shut the}} blinds down very tightly {{that first night}} in the hostile Indian country, and lay on our arms. We slept on them some, {{but most of the}} time we only lay on them. We did not talk much, but kept quiet and listened. It was an inky-black night, and {{occasionally}} rainy. We were among woods and rocks, hills and gorges--so shut in, in fact, that when we peeped through a chink in a curtain, we could discern nothing. The driver and conductor on top were still, too, or only spoke at long intervals, in low tones, as is the way of men in the midst of invisible dangers. We listened to rain-drops pattering on the roof; and the grinding of the wheels through the muddy gravel; and the low wailing of the wind; and all the time we had that absurd sense upon us, inseparable from travel at night in a close-curtained vehicle, the sense of remaining perfectly still in one place, notwithstanding the jolting and swaying of the vehicle, the trampling of the horses, and the grinding of the wheels. We listened a long time, with intent faculties and bated breath; every time one of us would relax, and draw a long sigh of relief and <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> a comrade would be sure to utter a sudden [...] "Hark!" [...] and instantly the experimenter was rigid and listening again. So the tiresome minutes and decades of minutes dragged away, until at last our tense forms filmed over with a dulled consciousness, and we slept, if one might call such a condition by so strong a name--for it was a sleep set with a hair-trigger. It was a sleep seething and teeming with a weird and distressful confusion of shreds and fag-ends of dreams--a sleep that was a chaos. Presently, dreams and sleep and the sullen hush of the night were startled by a ringing report, and cloven by such a long, wild, agonizing shriek! Then we heard--ten steps from the stage-- ...|$|R
