Dynamic {{model of the}} induction motor in the stationary reference frame was adopted and modified to reflect <b>single-phasing</b> fault. A simulation algorithm was proposed, which can help determine the impact of <b>single-phasing</b> on any three phase induction motor. A case study simulation was carried-out with sudden <b>single-phasing</b> using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. A <b>single-phasing</b> protection by means of contactors was reviewed before an enhanced <b>single-phasing</b> protection was designed. A prototype of the enhanced protection method was implemented {{by the use of}} ac to dc converter, PIC 16 F 877 A and DC relays. The latter, in additional to offering protection against <b>single-phasing,</b> also protects the motor from under-voltage, over-voltage and voltage unbalance.

50|$|<b>Single-phase</b> {{generator}} (also {{known as}} <b>single-phase</b> alternator) is an alternating current electrical generator {{that produces a}} single, continuously alternating voltage. <b>Single-phase</b> generators {{can be used to}} generate power in <b>single-phase</b> electric power systems. However, polyphase generators are generally used to deliver power in three-phase distribution system and the current is converted to <b>single-phase</b> near the <b>single-phase</b> loads instead. Therefore, <b>single-phase</b> generators are found in applications that are most often used when the loads being driven are relatively light, and not connected to a three-phase distribution, for instance, portable engine-generators. Larger <b>single-phase</b> generators are also used in special applications such as <b>single-phase</b> traction power for railway electrification systems.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical method for computing the minimum capacitance required to initiate voltage build-up in a three-phase induction generator self-excited {{with a single}} capacitance and supplying a single-phase load. Attention {{is focused on the}} Steinmetz connection which gives superior performance over the plain <b>single-phasing</b> mode of operation. From a consideration of the input impedance of the induction generator and the self-excitation conditions, two nonlinear equations are obtained. Solution of one equation using the Secant method enables the excitation frequency to be determined, and the minimum excitation capacitance can be calculated from the second equation. This solution technique is subsequently employed in an iterative procedure for computing the capacitance required to maintain the terminal voltage at a preset value when the generator is supplying load.

The <b>single-phase</b> and three-phase combined co-phase power supply system is more suitable for the existing substation conversion where the TT has Vv or Vx connection.

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>single-phase</b> solid ER “fluids” is {{considered}} as a branch of study of ER fluids. Due {{to the study of}} <b>single-phase</b> solid ER “fluids” faces many extreme difficulties, such as <b>single-phase</b> solid ER particles cannot form suspensions in gravity environment. Comparing to the study of two-phase ER fluids, it is relatively under-developed in both scientific and applied fronts. In this thesis, a microgravity experimental method for <b>single-phase</b> ER fluids study is introduced. This high sensitive electrorheological experimental setup is designed particularly for <b>single-phase</b> ER fluids drop tube microgravity experiment. We have successfully fabricated the experimental setup and tested the system with drop tube experiments. This experimental setup consists of a microgravity electro-rheometer, an imaging system, an experimental controller and the supporting parts. 100 microns glass particles are selected as ER material for the test experiment of the experimental setup. It is now proven that the experimental setup could work functionally and stably for repetitive drop tube microgravity experiments. This microgravity experimental method has the potential to greatly improve the study of ER fluids (both <b>single-phase</b> and two-phase ER fluids), the development of <b>single-phase</b> ER material and the development of applications of <b>single-phase</b> ER fluids...|$|R
50|$|A {{split-phase}} or <b>single-phase</b> three-wire {{system is}} a type of <b>single-phase</b> electric power distribution.

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that firstly the {{reactive}} power compensation using balance transformer or Vv connected-TT as discussed before will occupy extra capacity of the TT while the active power compensation will not. On the contrary, the active power compensation will share the TT load and thus increase the system efficiency. Secondly, according to the national standard, a certain amount of negative sequence power is allowed in power system [11]. Thirdly, a balanced transformer is most effective and economic in compensating the negative sequence. Based on the above considerations, two schemes of combined co-phase power supply are proposed: One is the <b>single-phase</b> and three-phase combined co-phase supply system comprising a <b>single-phase</b> TT and a high-voltage three-phase matching transformer; another is the <b>single-phase</b> and <b>single-phase</b> combined co-phase supply system comprising a <b>single-phase</b> TT and a high-voltage <b>single-phase</b> matching transformer.|$|R
