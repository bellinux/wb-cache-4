50|$|A larger wave of German {{immigrants}} {{followed in}} the 1870s and 1880s, including social democratic followers of Ferdinand Lasalle. Lasalle regarded state aid through <b>political</b> <b>action</b> as the road to revolution and opposed trade unionism, which he saw as futile, believing that according to the Iron Law of Wages employers would only pay subsistence wages. The Lasalleans formed the Social Democratic Party of North America in 1874 and both Marxists and Lasalleans formed the Workingmen's Party of the United States in 1876. When the Lasalleans gained control in 1877, they changed the name to the Socialist Labor Party of North America (SLP). However, many <b>socialists</b> abandoned <b>political</b> <b>action</b> altogether and moved to trade unionism. Two former socialists, Adolph Strasser and Samuel Gompers, formed the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1886.|$|R

25|$|In 1897 Victor Berger {{decided to}} work at {{converting}} the Social Democracy of America, an organization established {{with the goal of}} constructing a socialist colony in some western American state into a full-fledged <b>socialist</b> <b>political</b> party. He gathered together Debs, Stedman, and others for this cause, which came to a climax at the heated June 1898 convention of the organization. The battle over the main question of colonization versus independent <b>political</b> <b>action</b> was won by the colonization faction by a vote of 53 to 37, a result that caused Berger, Debs, Stedman, and their co-thinkers to bolt the convention and establish a new political organization of their own — the Social Democratic Party of America (SDP).|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Victor Berger and {{his group}} were urging him {{to create a new}} <b>socialist</b> <b>political</b> party, {{committed}} to <b>political</b> <b>action</b> and not colonization. Lermond, Parsons and Reed attended the June 1897 convention of the ARU which created the Social Democracy of America, but the BCC did not join the new organization, rejecting its [...] "class struggle" [...] thesis with a vision of a colony that would include middle-class professionals and [...] "everybody who believes in co-operation" [...] and not just [...] "the laboring classes so called". Weakened by the loss of Debs and the defection of some of its membership to the new SDA, the BCC set out to start its first colony.|$|R
