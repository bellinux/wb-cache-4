50|$|These {{scales are}} used in the modern bakery, grocery, delicatessen, seafood, meat, produce and other {{perishable}} goods departments. Supermarket <b>scales</b> can <b>print</b> labels and receipts, mark weight/count, unit price, total price and in some cases tare. Some modern supermarket <b>scales</b> <b>print</b> an RFID tag {{that can be used to}} track the item for tampering or returns. In most cases these types of scales have a sealed calibration so that the reading on the display is correct and cannot be tampered with. In the USA the scales are certified by the National Conference on Weights and Measures' NTEP, in South Africa by the South African Bureau of Standards and in the UK by the International Organization of Legal Metrolog.|$|R

50|$|An architect's {{scale is}} a scaled, three-edged ruler which has six {{different}} scales marked to its sides. A typical combination for building details is 1:20, 1:50, 1:100, 1:25, 1:75 and 1:125. There are separate rulers for zoning {{work as well}} as for inch units. Today scale rulers are made of plastic, formerly they were made of hardwood. A pocket-sized version is also available, with <b>scales</b> <b>printed</b> on flexible plastic strips.|$|R
50|$|Appel's artwork {{occupies}} spaces {{within and}} between the practices of abstract painting and architecture; following a trajectory describing the slow and messy dissolution of the structural integrity {{of the house and}} home and the psychological effects of such failures. Appel's painted surfaces vacillate between approximations of architectural surfaces and pure paint forming a complex matrix of abstract form. His current paintings are large abstractions painted on large <b>scale</b> <b>printed</b> photographs of Appel's own taking.|$|R

50|$|Scale focus, or zone focus, {{is a type}} of {{focusing}} system used by many inexpensive cameras from the 1940s and 1950s. These cameras have an adjustable focus, but lack a focusing aid such as a rangefinder. It is necessary to determine the distance to the subject and set the focus using a <b>scale</b> <b>printed</b> on the lens. If you are good at estimating distances, or have a tape measure at hand, you can get precise, sharp focus with one of these cameras.|$|R
50|$|The {{residential}} area {{just to the}} north of Kasuga-dori Avenue, on which the station is situated, is laden with parks and green belts, which is rare for such a central neighborhood. Tokyo's printing district is another point of interest in the area. Just south of the Koishikawa Botanical Garden is a neighborhood full of many tiny <b>scale</b> <b>printing</b> shops that are simply houses converted into printing enterprises, many of them situated on narrow streets which sometimes become congested with forklifts and trucks delivering paper and printed material.|$|R
5000|$|Digital {{techniques}} {{are commonly used}} in advertisements. A [...] "wallscape" [...] is a large advertisement on or attached to the outside wall of a building. Wallscapes can be painted directly on the wall as a mural, or printed on vinyl and securely attached to {{the wall in the}} manner of a billboard. Although not strictly classed as murals, large <b>scale</b> <b>printed</b> media are often referred to as such. Advertising murals were traditionally painted onto buildings and shops by sign-writers, later as large scale poster billboards.|$|R

She uses color-reduction wood cut prints in small and large <b>scale</b> <b>prints.</b> Some of her prints are almost five feet long in order to expose the view to {{degrading}} clichés. Andry's works never contain a specific person, but more of an ideal of certain groups of people instead.

5000|$|For example, if {{the point}} of impact is 3 inches high and 1.5 inches left of {{the point of}} aim at 100 yards (which for {{instance}} could be measured by using a spotting scope with a calibrated reticle), the scope needs to be adjusted 3 MOA down, and 1.5 MOA right. Such adjustments are trivial when the scope's adjustment dials have a MOA <b>scale</b> <b>printed</b> on them, and even figuring the right number of clicks is relatively easy on scopes that click in fractions of MOA. This makes zeroing and adjustments much easier: ...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} instruments derived {{power to}} move the pen directly from the sensed process signal, which limited their sensitivity and speed of response. Friction between the marking device and paper would reduce {{the accuracy of the}} measurements. Instruments with pneumatic, mechanical, or electromechanical amplifiers decoupled pen movement from process measurement, greatly increasing the sensitivity of the instrument and the flexibility of the recorder. Directly-driven pens often moved in the arc of a circle, making the scale difficult to read; pre-printed charts have curvilinear <b>scales</b> <b>printed</b> on them that compensated for the path of the marking pen.|$|R

50|$|Boyd was {{announced}} as the Royal Scottish Academy's Artist in Residence at Sabhal Mor Ostaig on the Isle of Skye in Scotland for 2012-13, a role which would see his work explore Scottish Gaelic culture and landscape. Working with acclaimed Japanese photographer Takeshi Shikama, Boyd made work {{focusing on the}} Cuillin mountain range and the Quiraing, {{as well as the}} clearance villages of Skye. The series also took Boyd to the Outer Hebrides, documenting the landscapes of Lewis and Harris as well as the remote archipelago of St Kilda. The resultant large <b>scale</b> <b>prints</b> were displayed prominently at the Royal Scottish Academy as part of their Resident 13 Exhibition in Winter 2013.|$|R

5000|$|One {{slide rule}} {{remaining}} in daily use {{around the world}} is the E6B. This is a circular slide rule first created in the 1930s for aircraft pilots to help with dead reckoning. With the aid of <b>scales</b> <b>printed</b> on the frame it also helps with such miscellaneous tasks as converting time, distance, speed, and temperature values, compass errors, and calculating fuel use. The so-called [...] "prayer wheel" [...] is still available in flight shops, and remains widely used. While GPS has reduced the use of dead reckoning for aerial navigation, and handheld calculators have taken over many of its functions, the E6B remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students have some degree of proficiency in its use.|$|R
