50|$|The Somali Civil War (Dagaalkii Sokeeye ee Soomaaliya, الحرب الأهلية الصومالية) is {{an ongoing}} civil war taking place in Somalia. It grew out of {{resistance}} to the Siad Barre regime during the 1980s. By 1988-90, the Somali Armed Forces began engaging various armed rebel groups, including the <b>Somali</b> <b>Salvation</b> Democratic <b>Front</b> in the northeast, the Somali National Movement in the northwest, and the United Somali Congress in the south. The clan-based armed opposition groups eventually managed to overthrow the Barre government in 1991.|$|R

25|$|For the Barre regime, the {{invasion}} {{was perhaps the}} greatest strategic blunder since independence, and it weakened the military. Almost one-third of the regular SNA soldiers, three-eighths of the armored units {{and half of the}} Somali Air Force (SAF) were lost. The weakness of the Barre administration led it to effectively abandon the dream of a unified Greater Somalia. The failure of the war aggravated discontent with the Barre regime; the first organized opposition group, the <b>Somali</b> <b>Salvation</b> Democratic <b>Front</b> (SSDF), was formed by army officers in 1979.|$|R

50|$|Farah's {{political}} career began in 1969, {{when he was}} a junior member of the military junta that took control of Somalia in 1969 under Siad Barre.

During this period, he worked with the National Security Service to have many opponents to the government arrested. He also served as governor of Shabeellaha Dhexe and Bakool, and as the Somali ambassador to Japan and Germany.

50|$|Somali Patriotic Movement {{was formed}} in 1985 {{as a result of}} a split in the <b>Somali</b> <b>Salvation</b> Democratic <b>Front</b> by {{military}} dissidents hailing from Gabyow's own Ogaden.

The sacking of Gabyow was the catalyst for a conflict that had been smouldering over a number of years. In March 1989 soldiers of the Ogaden mutinied in Kismayo, and fighting continued until the government troops gained the upper hand in July.|$|R

5|$|The {{shift in}} support by the Soviet Union {{motivated}} the Barre regime to seek allies elsewhere.

Following the disastrous Ogaden War, Barre's government began arresting government and military officials under suspicion {{of participation in the}} abortive 1978 coup d'état.

50|$|In January 1991, Somalian President Mohammed Siad Barre {{was overthrown}} by a {{coalition}} of opposing clans, precipitating the Somali Civil War. The Somali National Army concurrently disbanded, and some former soldiers reconstituted as irregular regional forces or joined the clan militias. The main rebel group in the capital Mogadishu was the United Somali Congress (USC), which later divided into two armed factions: one led by Ali Mahdi Muhammad, who became president, and the other by Mohamed Farrah Aidid. In total, there were four opposition groups that competed for political control - the USC, <b>Somali</b> <b>Salvation</b> Democratic <b>Front</b> (SSDF), <b>Somali</b> Patriotic Movement (SPM) and Somali Democratic Movement (SDM). A ceasefire was agreed in June 1991, but failed to hold. A fifth group, the Somali National Movement (SNM), declared independence in the northwest portion of Somalia later in June. The SNM renamed this unrecognized territory Somaliland, and selected its leader Abdirahman Ahmed Ali Tuur as president.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, {{three groups}} of Majertin anti-Siad Barre émigrés in Aden (then part of South Yemen) formed the <b>Somali</b> <b>Salvation</b> Democratic <b>Front,</b> {{with the purpose of}} {{fighting}} alongside Ethiopian forces in the Ogaden War against the Siad Barre regime. The invasion was withdrawn in 1982 when the United States sent emergency military aid to Somalia. The organization became divided increasingly along clan lines, leading to the imprisonment of many leading members including Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, and the defection of many to the Siad Barre regime.During the civil war, the SSDF began consolidating their control over the Mudug, Nugaal and Bari regions. The Anarchy period saw the region torn apart with internecine factional fighting, and a determined attempt by al-Ittihad al-Islami to take over the region by force from their base in Bosaso, leading to an incredibly bloody war that the SSDF won at high cost. Finally in 1998, the SSDF along with the United Somali Party and the Somali National Democratic Union agreed to form a joint administration and state, that being Puntland. Ever since then, Puntland and Somaliland have been in a sometimes-violent dispute over the primarily Darod regions of Sool and Sanaag.|$|R
