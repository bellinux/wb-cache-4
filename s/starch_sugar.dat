500|$|Biofuel {{development}} and use is a complex issue {{because there are many}} biofuel options which are available. [...] Biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, are currently produced from the products of conventional food crops such as the <b>starch,</b> <b>sugar</b> and oil feedstocks from crops that include wheat, maize, sugar cane, palm oil and oilseed rape. Some researchers fear that a major switch to biofuels from such crops would create a direct competition with their use for food and animal feed, and claim that {{in some parts of the}} world the economic consequences are already visible, other researchers look at the land available and the enormous areas of idle and abandoned land and claim that there is room for a large proportion of biofuel also from conventional crops.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} of NIRS (near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy) to predict the major constituents (<b>starch,</b> <b>sugars,</b> cellulose, proteins and minerals) of the sweet potato root. Overall, 240 accessions were morphologically described, chemically analysed and their NIR spectra recorded. No correlations were observed between aerial and underground traits, and between morphological traits and major constituents. Calibration equations, developed on 190 accessions, showed high explained variances in cross-validation (r 2 cv) for <b>starch</b> (0. 82), <b>sugars</b> (0. 91), proteins (0. 89) and minerals (0. 74) but no response for cellulose (0. 21). The predictions were tested on an independent set of 50 randomly selected accessions. The r 2 pred values for <b>starch,</b> <b>sugars</b> and proteins were, respectively, of 0. 71, 0. 82 and 0. 87 with ratios of performance to deviation (RPD) of 2. 11, 2. 29 and 2. 93. New calibration equations developed on 240 accessions showed improved RPD values for <b>starch</b> (2. 65), <b>sugars</b> (2. 75), cellulose (1. 58), proteins (3. 47) and minerals (2. 34), indicating that larger sets could improve prediction.

Chemical analyses were conducted on 315 accessions for major constituents (<b>starch,</b> total <b>sugars,</b> cellulose, proteins, and minerals). NIRS calibration equations, developed on a calibration set composed of 243 accessions, showed high explained variances in crossvalidation (r 2 cv) for <b>starch</b> (0. 89), <b>sugars</b> (0. 90), proteins (0. 89), and minerals (0. 90) but poor response for amylose (0. 44) and cellulose (0. 61).

The r 2 pred values for <b>starch,</b> <b>sugars,</b> proteins, and minerals were, respectively, of 0. 76, 0. 74, 0. 85, and 0. 85 with ratios of performance to deviation (RPD) of 3. 41, 4. 01, 3. 78, and 3. 64.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Thousands of yam (Dioscorea spp.) accessions are {{maintained}} in germplasm collections. The physico-chemical {{characteristics of the}} tubers are rarely characterised. Unless a simple, low cost, screening tool is available, {{it is difficult to}} evaluate the quality of varieties and breeding lines. We investigated the potential of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) as an alternative method for predicting the major constituents of the yam tuber. RESULTS:Twohundredandsixty-five accessions,belonging to seven different Dioscorea spp.,were analysed for <b>starch,</b> amylose, <b>sugars,</b> proteins, minerals and cellulose. The comparison of the NIR spectra and the chemical values allowed the establishment of equations of calibration for the prediction of <b>starch,</b> <b>sugars</b> and proteins (equivalent N). The r 2 pred values for <b>starch,</b> <b>sugars</b> and proteins (respectively 0. 84, 0. 86 and 0. 88) are high enough to allow good estimates of their contents. Values for the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) of 4. 046 and 3. 641 for the sugars and proteins models also allow good quantitative predictions to be made. Amylose, cellulose and minerals could not be predicted precisely. A second calibration conducted by adding the calibration and validation sets (260 accessions) revealed an improvement of the RPD values for <b>starch,</b> <b>sugars</b> and proteins, indicating that the models can be improved. Discriminant analysis conducted using 2151 wavelengths (in nanometres) as variables was applied to a set of 214 accessions of D. alata and the results were compared to the principal component analysis of chemical data. Accessions can be classified according to the amylaceous fraction of the chemotype. CONCLUSION:NIRS could be used in yam breeding programmes to characterise rapidly and at lowcost the numerous accessions and breeding lines. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
