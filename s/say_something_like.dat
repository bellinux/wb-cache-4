500|$|Reports {{arose in}} the media that the ticket sales for the tour were falling, leading Arthur Fogel, Chairman of Live Nation's Global Touring division, to brand them as [...] "ridiculous". He {{clarified}} to Billboard that the about 80% of the tickets were sold in North America and Europe, and {{they were still in}} the process of releasing future dates for numerous venues. The 29 shows in North America had grossed around US $26 million, with an average of almost $900,000 per show. Fogel also addressed concerns that Live Nation had lost $30 million from Gaga's tour, saying that if a similar situation really happened, then the company would have cancelled the concerts. [...] "I just don't know how this shit gets any traction without people doing their homework... Just a complete fool would <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that and it could only come from somebody who has an agenda, because it makes absolutely no sense, on any level", Fogel concluded. A total of 800,000 tickets have been sold for the tour, as reported by Billboard.|$|E

But any explanation for rule following behaviour cannot be given in terms of following a rule, without involving circularity. One can <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> [...] "She did X because of the rule R" [...] but if you say [...] "She followed R because of the rule R1" [...] one can then ask [...] "but why did she follow rule R1?" [...] and so potentially become involved in a regression. Explanation must have an end.|$|E

[...] "We did four years with Mr. Allen and got one thousand dollars a week," [...] Gloria DeMarco remembered. [...] "Sunday night was the best night on radio." [...] Sunday night with Fred Allen seemed incomplete on any night listeners didn't hear the DeMarco Sisters, whose breezy, harmonious style became as familiar as their cheerfully sung [...] "Mr. Al-len, Mr. Alll-llennnn" [...] in the show's opening theme. During the theme's brief pause, Allen would <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "It isn't the mayor of Anaheim, Azusa and Cucamonga, kiddies." [...] That device became a signature for {{three of the four}} years.|$|E

2500|$|In linguistics, an honorific (abbreviated [...] ) is a {{grammatical}} or morphosyntactic {{form that}} encodes the relative social {{status of the}} participants of the conversation. Distinct from honorific titles, linguistic honorifics convey formality , social distance, politeness , humility , deference, or respect through the choice of an alternate form such as an affix, clitic, grammatical case, change in person or number, or an entirely different lexical item. A key feature of an honorific system is that one can convey the same message in both honorific and familiar forms—i.e., {{it is possible to}} <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> (as in an oft-cited example from Brown and Levinson) [...] "The soup is hot" [...] in a way that confers honor or deference on one of the participants of the conversation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} {{completed}} {{one day before}} it debuted at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival in the 2,400-seat Grand Auditorium. After the screening, it received [...] "wild cheering" [...] from the audience. When Jury President Bernardo Bertolucci announced Wild at Heart as the Palme d'Or winner at the awards ceremony, the boos almost drowned out the cheers, with film critic Roger Ebert leading the vocal detractors. Barry Gifford remembers {{that there was a}} prevailing mood that the media was hoping Lynch would fail. [...] "All kinds of journalists were trying to cause controversy and have me <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> 'This is nothing like the book' or 'He ruined my book'. I think everybody from Time magazine to What's On In London was disappointed when I said 'This is fantastic. This is wonderful. It's like a big, dark, musical comedy'".|$|E

Because they knew perfectly well, that that is where you draw the wagons around." [...] Larry King, who is Jewish, replied, [...] "When you say—when you <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that, you are playing right in, though, to anti-Semitic people who say the Jews are—" [...] Brando interrupted: [...] "No, no, because I will be the first one who will appraise the Jews honestly and say 'Thank God for the Jews'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prominent Republican {{politicians}} {{reacted to}} the speech as well. Former Arkansas governor and 2008 candidate for president Mike Huckabee praised Obama's speech on the MSNBC program Morning Joe, while also commenting on the Rev. Wright controversy. Huckabee argued that Obama [...] "handled this {{about as well as}} anybody could" [...] and suggested that it was [...] "a very historic speech." [...] While he decried the remarks made by Wright, Huckabee, a former pastor himself, also noted that [...] "sermons...are rarely written word-for-word" [...] and that pastors often get [...] "caught up in the emotion of the moment." [...] Referencing his experience growing up in the segregated South and the legacy of Jim Crow, the former Arkansas governor noted that [...] "we've got to cut some slack to people who grew up being called names, being told, 'You have to sit in the balcony when you go to [...] movie'...Sometimes people do have a chip on their shoulder and resentment. And you have to just say, I probably would too." [...] Huckabee suggested that he was [...] "probably the only conservative in America who's going to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{narrative}} for Overwatch {{is led by}} Blizzard's senior game designer Michael Chu. Creating {{a narrative}} for the game was a challenge compared to past Blizzard titles as the game lacks a single-player mode or a traditional story-telling mechanic. Instead, the story crafters for the game sought to create a spanning narrative that could be interjected into the game through short in-game dialogue and unlockable hero skins. A March 2017 patch for the game added short character biographies, as well as lore details about specific character skins in the Hero Gallery. Outside of the game, the narrative is primarily driven by a transmedia storytelling method, which includes animated shorts and digitally released comics. This gives the developers some flexibility as to where they can take the story as Overwatch is expanded over the years. The narrative can still be seen being hinted at through map environments and character dialogue within the game itself; Chu explains that [...] "you get a character like Soldier: 76 and he says, like: 'back in my day we'd have this payload delivered'. And then you get a character like Zenyatta, the robot monk, and he would <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "becoming one with the objective." [...] So we find these ways to really differentiate them and it makes for unexpected and sometimes ridiculous lines." [...] Blizzard also found ways to include narrative elements through limited-time events, such as the [...] "Junkenstein's Revenge" [...] event during October 2016 and the April 2017 [...] "Uprising" [...] event. Chu said that with these types of events, they will encourage players to explore the other forms of media that Blizzard is using to develop the Overwatch narrative, as well as prompt fans to continue to explore and speculate on the world and characters they created.|$|E
