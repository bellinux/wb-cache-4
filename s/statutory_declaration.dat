5|$|In June 1866 the Claimant {{moved to}} Sydney, {{where he was}} able to raise money from banks {{on the basis of a}} <b>statutory</b> <b>declaration</b> that he was Roger Tichborne. The {{statement}} was later found to contain many errors, although the birthdate and parentage details were given correctly. It included a brief account of how he had arrived in Australia: he and others from the sinking Bella, he said, had been picked up by the Osprey, bound for Melbourne. On arrival he had taken the name Thomas Castro from an acquaintance from Melipilla and had wandered for some years before settling in Wagga Wagga. He had married a pregnant housemaid, Mary Ann Bryant, and taken her child, a daughter, as his own; a further daughter had been born in March 1866.|$|E

25|$|A second <b>statutory</b> <b>declaration</b> {{was filed}} on 1 July 2008 by Abdul Razak Baginda's private {{investigator}} P Balasubramaniam, disclosing then deputy Prime Minister Najib's links and Altantuya. Bala said the police omitted {{information about the}} relationship between Najib and Altantuya during their investigation. In the <b>statutory</b> <b>declaration</b> Abdul Razak had told Balasubramaniam that the deputy prime minister had a sexual relationship with Altantuya and that the trio had dined together in Paris. Detailed conversations in a <b>statutory</b> <b>declaration</b> revealed which Abdul Razak was in effect inherited Altantuya as a lover from Najib, who passed her on because he didn’t want to be harassed as deputy prime minister. Among other lurid details, Balasubramaniam described text messages between Najib and Abdul Razak in which the latter was asking for help to avoid arrest, implying Najib personally interfered with the murder investigation. In making his <b>statutory</b> <b>declaration,</b> Balasubramaniam mentioned that a man in a blue Proton Saga happened to be driving pass the home of defence analyst Abdul Razak Baginda at that time of the day before Altantuya was reported missing on 19 October 2006 and revealed that the man was Nasir Safar, the special advisor to Najib Abdul Razak.|$|E

25|$|On 16 July 2008 the Malaysian {{police have}} {{obtained}} a warrant of arrest against Raja Petra for criminal defamation.

On 17 July, Raja Petra was charged with three counts of criminal intimidation over his <b>statutory</b> <b>declaration</b> on the murder of Mongolian translator Altantuya Shaariibuu. He {{is alleged to have}} defamed Deputy Prime Minister's wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor by making a libellous statement in the declaration which he affirmed on 18 June when he knew that it would tarnish her good name.

25|$|Raja Petra later distanced {{himself from}} the <b>statutory</b> <b>declaration</b> in an {{interview}} with TV3, saying his accusations linking Najib and Rosmah to the murder was repeating information passed onto him by opposition figures, rather than information he knew to be true himself.

25|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students although it does allow all students living in the community to have entry, as of right, regardless of their academic or social profile. In addition, there is evidence that property values surrounding some more desirable schools become inflated, thus restricting the ability of lower socio-economic groups to purchase a house in the zone, though this is off set by the fact that students are accepted from rental accommodation or from homes where they are boarding with a bona fide relative or friend living in the zone. Some parents have purposely flouted zone boundaries by giving false addresses, such as that of a business they own in the zone, or by renting homes in the zone only through the enrolment process and moving out before the student commences school. Schools are now requesting rates invoices, tenancy agreements, or power and telephone bills from parents to prove their residential address, Some schools have gone as far as requiring parents to make a <b>statutory</b> <b>declaration</b> before a Justice of the Peace or similar that they live in the school zone, which makes it impossible for a parent to cheat the zone without also committing a criminal offence (making a false <b>statutory</b> <b>declaration</b> is punishable by up to three years' imprisonment).|$|E
25|$|As {{vaccination}} spread, some European countries made it compulsory. Concern {{about its}} safety led to opposition and then repeal of legislation in some instances. Compulsory infant vaccination {{was introduced in}} England by the 1853 Vaccination Act. By 1871, parents could be fined for non-compliance, and then imprisoned for non-payment. This intensified opposition, and the 1898 Vaccination Act introduced a conscience clause. This allowed exemption on production of a certificate of conscientious objection signed by two magistrates. Such certificates were not always easily obtained and a further Act in 1907 allowed exemption by a <b>statutory</b> <b>declaration</b> {{which could not be}} refused. Although theoretically still compulsory, the 1907 Act effectively marked the end of compulsory infant vaccination in England.|$|E

25|$|Although Levine {{ruled in}} Marsden's favour on the {{allegations}} of child sexual abuse, his findings were deeply critical of Marsden in other regards.

He also found that on the balance of probabilities, Marsden had used convicted rapist and murderer Les Murphy to persuade a witness to change his position, and had probably persuaded two other witnesses to influence another. According to then Sydney Star Observer editor Marcus O'Donnell, Marsden asked the Observer to publish the names of one of the prosecution witnesses, when there was a suppression order given {{on the grounds that the}} witness's life would be in danger if the name were published.|$|E
25|$|In The Malaysian Insider interview, Abdul Razak Baginda {{claimed that}} Altantuya Shaariibuu had {{repeatedly}} harassed and blackmailed {{him for an}} amount of US$5,000 and US$8,000, which prompted him to enlist Deputy Superintendent Musa Safri for help, and hire private investigator P. Balasubramaniam for protection. Altantuya is later murdered, allegedly under police custody of Sirul Azhar and Azilah Hadri. Both were convicted for murder from the physical evidence found in Sirul's car, Sirul's house and an account that they both were present at the hotel Altantuya stayed, and outside of Razak's house. Sirul denied Musa Safri's involvement, and Abdul Razak Baginda was acquitted from the murder charge due to reasonable doubt raised from the record of 144 telephone calls and SMS-es made between him and Musa Safri. Abdul Razak Baginda also denied the murder was related to his submarine deal, and claimed P.
