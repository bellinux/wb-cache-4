5|$|Because {{they have}} to carry the large water tank and fuel for the burner, snow melting {{machines}} tend to be much larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around , with the largest being hauled by semi-trailer tractor units. In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plow or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 metric tons of snow per hour, compared to the 5,000 metric tons per hour capacity of any large <b>snow</b> <b>blower.</b>|$|E
5|$|In New Jersey, {{increasing}} winds caused blowing and drifting of {{the snow}} and led to near-blizzard conditions. Behind the storm, very cold and gusty weather lingered. New Jersey Transit shut down bus service in northern portions of the state, and rail lines had 20-minute delays. Most injuries in the state were related to physical strain while shoveling, <b>snow</b> <b>blower</b> accidents or slips and falls. As the snowfall was of a light nature, few trees limbs and electrical wires were downed by the storm. GPU Energy reported only around 5,500 power outages. A countywide state of emergency was declared in Sussex County, as vehicles were sliding off roadways. Several other traffic accidents and delays were reported throughout the state, and in Somerset County, a few roads were closed due to the snow. A Red Cross shelter was opened for residents of a Spotswood trailer park.|$|E
500|$|To build a {{permanent}} airfield at Troll, the Norwegian Polar Institute bought a snow groomer and a tracked vehicle with a <b>snow</b> <b>blower,</b> flatbed and ice cutter. The works was organized with a land-based Global Positioning System laser system. In {{the course of}} the 2002 season, [...] of runway had been built. This included removing of surface rocks and filling any crevasses. The construction also included necessary ground facilities, such as a fire- and rescue service, communications, ground handling and overnight facilities at Troll for personnel who could be stranded because of bad weather. The construction involved the moving of [...] of ice and snow.|$|E

500|$|Snow blowers, {{also known}} as {{rotating}} snowplows or snow cutters, {{can be used in}} place of snowplows on winter service vehicles. A <b>snow</b> <b>blower</b> consists of a rapidly spinning auger which cuts through the snow, forcing it out of a funnel attached {{to the top of the}} blower. Snow blowers typically clear much faster than plows, with some clearing in excess of [...] of snow per hour, and can cut through far deeper snow drifts than a snowplow can. In addition, snow blowers can remove snow from the roadway completely, rather than piling it at the side of the road, making passage easier for other road users and preventing the windrow from blocking driveways.|$|E

50|$|In 1927, Outremont {{became the}} {{first place in the}} world to use a <b>snow</b> <b>blower</b> to clear its streets in the winter. It was the first {{production}} model of Canadian inventor Arthur Sicard's Sicard Industries.|$|E
50|$|Snow blowers can {{generally}} {{be divided into}} two classes: single-stage and two-stage. On a single-stage <b>snow</b> <b>blower,</b> the auger (the paddle mechanism visible from the front) pulls snow into the machine and directs it out of a discharge chute. The auger contacts the ground, making single-stage snow blowers unsuitable for use on unpaved surfaces. On a two-stage <b>snow</b> <b>blower,</b> the auger pulls snow into the machine and feeds it into a high-speed impeller, which in turn directs it out of a discharge chute. Two-stage snow blowers can generally handle deeper snow depths than single-stage ones, and because their augers don't touch the ground, they can be used on unpaved surfaces.|$|E
50|$|When the Gem 4/4s are {{operating}} on the Bernina Railway, their diesel engines are needed only in case of failure of the contact wires, for example following an avalanche. In that event, one of the locomotive's two generators {{can be used to}} supply an Xrote (Ger.) class <b>snow</b> <b>blower</b> (either no 9918 or no 9919) with DC current, and the second generator is sufficiently powerful to move the locomotive and <b>snow</b> <b>blower.</b> In this way, the DC powered blowers can also be put to use on the Rhaetian Railway's core network. However, this has seldom been the case since the delivery of the Rhaetian Railway's Xrotm (Ger.) class diesel powered snow blowers.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{acquisition}} of <b>snow</b> <b>blowers</b> in the late 1970s a small portable ski tow was often {{set up in the}} field across from the Allargue Arms Hotel near Corgarff just below the snow gates giving approximately 200 ft of ski run.|$|R
5000|$|Riding {{lawn mowers}} can often mount other devices, such as rototillers/rotavators, <b>snow</b> plows, <b>snow</b> <b>blowers,</b> yard vacuums, {{occasionally}} even front buckets or fork-lift tines (these are more properly known as [...] "lawn tractors" [...] in this case, being {{designed for a}} number of tasks).|$|R
500|$|Some railroads {{occasionally}} use air-blowing machines, each {{powered by}} a jet engine to clear snow from tracks and switches. In addition to physically blowing snow {{with the force of}} the air, they melt recalictrant precipitation with exhaust temperatures over [...] [...] Approximately 100 are believed to have been manufactured in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s; they are used so rarely that they are generally maintained indefinitely rather than being replaced. [...] For example, in the Boston area the MBTA uses two model RP-3 Portec RMC Hurricane Jet <b>Snow</b> <b>Blowers,</b> nicknamed [...] "Snowzilla" [...] to clear heavy snows from the Ashmont–Mattapan High Speed Line and Wellington Yard. [...] The jet <b>snow</b> <b>blowers</b> can be faster and gentler than conventional removal methods, but consume a large amount of fuel.|$|R
50|$|The Subaru Industrial SX engine series from Subaru Industrial Power Products are {{designed}} specifically for use with snow throwers, also known as <b>snow</b> <b>blower.</b> The line includes three models, the 6 horsepower SX17, the 7 horsepower SX21 and the 9.5 horsepower SX30.|$|E
50|$|Archimedes screws {{are used}} in sewage {{treatment}} plants because they cope well with varying rates of flow and with suspended solids.

50|$|M-497 {{continued}} to serve for Penn Central after jet engine removal and was retired by Conrail in 1977. Engines were re-used as X29493, an experimental <b>snow</b> <b>blower.</b> Like most similar jet engine blowers, it was effective at clearing {{snow and ice}} but also tended to dislodge the ballast.|$|E
50|$|During the 1960s, IH Cub Cadet was {{marketed to}} the owners of {{increasingly}} popular rural homes with large lawns and private gardens.
