5|$|In {{some parts}} of the world (mainly Africa and South America), large ants, {{especially}} army ants, are used as <b>surgical</b> <b>sutures.</b> The wound is pressed together and ants are applied along it. The ant seizes the edges of the wound in its mandibles and locks in place. The body is then cut off and the head and mandibles remain in place to close the wound. The large heads of the dinergates (soldiers) of the leafcutting ant Atta cephalotes are also used by native surgeons in closing wounds.|$|E
5|$|Sheepskin is {{likewise}} used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products. Byproducts from {{the slaughter of}} sheep are also of value: sheep tallow {{can be used in}} candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and gelatin. Sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into <b>surgical</b> <b>sutures,</b> as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets. Sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper. Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.|$|E
25|$|In healthcare, {{triclosan}} {{is used in}} surgical scrubs {{and hand}} washes. Use in surgical units is effective with a minimum contact time of approximately two minutes. More recently, showering with 2% triclosan has become a recommended regimen in surgical units for the decolonization of patients whose skin carries methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Triclosan is also used in the coatings for some <b>surgical</b> <b>sutures.</b>|$|E
30|$|Tribological {{interactions}} between <b>surgical</b> <b>suture</b> and human tissue {{play an important}} role in the stitching process. The purpose of the paper is to understanding the tribological behavior of <b>surgical</b> <b>suture</b> interacting with artificial skin, with respect to <b>surgical</b> <b>suture</b> material and structure, by means of a capstan experiment approach and a contact area model. The results indicated that structure and surface topography of the <b>surgical</b> <b>suture</b> had a pronounced effect on the tribological interactions. The apparent coefficient of friction of vicryl <b>surgical</b> <b>suture</b> was the smallest among the three <b>surgical</b> <b>suture</b> materials. As the sliding velocity increased, or the applied load decreased, the coefficient of friction increased. Furthermore, stick-slip phenomena were observed during the sliding procedure.|$|R

2500|$|Although {{most of the}} {{publicity}} accrued to the British epidemic, {{the highest number of}} confirmed cases was actually in France. In 1992, sources in France reported to the MCA [...] "that BSE had now been reported in France and there were some licensed <b>surgical</b> <b>sutures</b> derived from French bovine material." [...] Concerns were also raised at a CSM meeting [...] "regarding a possible risk of transmission of the BSE agent in gelatin products." [...] For many years the French government and agricultural industry downplayed the extent of the epidemic, claiming just 923 confirmed cases. In 2004 this figure was challenged in an article in The Review of Veterinary Research which put the figure at 300,000. The scientists behind this study later heavily criticised the surveillance system, indicating they believed there had been an official cover-up. Epidemiologist Jean-Louis Thillier eventually concluded that between 1996 and 2006, over 300,000 cases of BSE had infected the national herd and that nine French people had died unnecessarily from the epidemic through the failure to report cases, a finding accepted by the judge who ordered the report.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the cytotoxicity of A. atlas L. silk on rat smooth muscle cells with the direct method of methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay compared to commercial <b>surgical</b> <b>suture</b> silk. The result showed that brown colored natural silk has low cytotoxicity as same as commercial <b>surgical</b> <b>suture</b> silk with slightly lower cell viability.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{interactive}} action between minimally invasive <b>surgical</b> <b>suture</b> needle and soft tissue was investigated under different insertion velocities, needle geometries, insertion angles and tissue characteristics {{to simulate the}} real <b>surgical</b> <b>suture</b> needle-tissue operation conditions. Experimental results demonstrated {{that the process of}} insertion was divided into two phases: no break phase and break phase. The puncture force generated at the mutation point where the tissue surface was breached. The puncture force and time for the first puncture significantly decreased with the increasing insertion velocity. The needle with triangle cross-section tip and larger size showed higher puncture force than that with round cross-section and smaller one. The penetration force reduced evidently with the advancing insertion angle, and it reached the lowest value when the angle is 90 °. Moreover, an empirical single-parameter model of third-degree polynomial could predict the stiffness when a suture needle inserted into a complex soft tissue and showed a good fit to the experiment data. The results would provide reliable and significant mechanical database for the design of force feedback system in the <b>surgical</b> <b>suture,</b> either in endoscopic surgery or robotic suturing...|$|R
50|$|A barbed suture {{is a type}} of knotless <b>surgical</b> <b>suture</b> {{that has}} barbs on its surface.
