25|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} may be self-limiting, frequently recurring, chronic or progressive. Most {{patients have}} severe symptoms lasting {{a few weeks}} to six months. 15 to 50 percent of cases involve recurrent bouts of arthritis. Chronic arthritis or <b>sacroiliitis</b> occurs in 15â€“30 percent of cases. Repeated attacks over many years are common, and patients sometimes end up with chronic and disabling arthritis, heart disease, amyloid deposits, ankylosing spondylitis, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, cardiac conduction abnormalities, or aortitis with aortic regurgitation. However, most people with reactive arthritis can expect to live normal life spans and maintain a near-normal lifestyle with modest adaptations to protect the involved organs.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 a small {{outbreak}} of systemic E. dermatitidis infection occurred in North Carolina hospitals, involving five women who received steroid injections for pain management. In one of women the infection wasn't evident until 152 days after injection of the contaminated solution. Isolates from these patients were {{found by the}} FDA to be susceptible to all of voriconazole, itraconazole, and amphotericin B. In one patient the infection caused <b>sacroiliitis,</b> while the remaining four developed meningitis. Meningitis eventually caused death in one patient, while voriconazole was successful in treating infection in the four other patients. The outbreak was traced back to a single compounding pharmacy, which was found by the FDA to have inadequately controlled for sterility of its products.|$|E
500|$|Psoriatic {{arthritis}} {{is a form}} {{of chronic}} inflammatory arthritis that has a highly variable clinical presentation and frequently occurs in association with skin and nail psoriasis. It typically involves painful inflammation of the joints and surrounding connective tissue and can occur in any joint, but most commonly affects the joints of the fingers and toes. [...] This can result in a sausage-shaped swelling of the fingers and toes known as dactylitis. Psoriatic arthritis can also affect the hips, knees, spine (spondylitis), and sacroiliac joint (<b>sacroiliitis).</b> About 30% of individuals with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis. Skin manifestations of psoriasis tend to occur before arthritic manifestations in about 75% of cases.|$|E

Rarer symptoms include [...] anaphylactic shock, anxiety, arthritis, bloated stomach, chest pains, depression or mood swings, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, joint and muscle aches and pains (may be associated with progressive arthritis), palpitations, psoriasis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), swollen throat or tongue, tiredness and lethargy, and unexplained cough.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnoses {{of wheat}} allergy may deserve special consideration. [...] Omega-5 gliadin, {{the most potent}} wheat allergen, cannot be {{detected}} in whole wheat preparations; it must be extracted and partially digested (similar to how it degrades in the intestine) to reach full activity. Other studies show that digestion of wheat proteins to about 10 amino acids can increase the allergic response 10 fold. Certain allergy tests may not be suitable to detect all wheat allergies, resulting in cryptic allergies. [...] Because many of the symptoms associated with wheat allergies, such as <b>sacroiliitis,</b> eczema and asthma, may be related or unrelated to a wheat allergy, medical deduction {{can be an effective}} way of determining the cause. If symptoms are alleviated by immunosuppressant drugs, such as Prednisone, an allergy-related cause is likely. [...] If multiple symptoms associated with wheat allergies are present in the absence of immunosuppressants then a wheat allergy is probable.|$|E

Common problems of the sacroiliac joint are often called sacroiliac joint dysfunction (also termed SI joint dysfunction; SIJD). Sacroiliac joint dysfunction generally refers to pain in the sacroiliac joint region that is caused by abnormal motion in the sacroiliac joint, either too much motion or too little motion.

50|$|People {{suffering}} from <b>sacroiliitis</b> can often experience symptoms {{in a number}} of different ways, however it is commonly related to the amount of pressure that is put onto the sacroiliac joint. <b>Sacroiliitis</b> pain is typically axial, meaning that the location of the condition is also where the pain is occurring. Symptoms commonly include prolonged, inflammatory pain in the lower back region, hips or buttocks.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Sacroiliitis</b> can be {{somewhat}} difficult to diagnose because the symptoms it manifests {{can also be}} caused by other, more common, conditions. If a physician suspects <b>sacroiliitis,</b> they will typically begin their diagnosis by performing a physical exam.

5000|$|For {{more severe}} forms of <b>sacroiliitis,</b> {{sacroiliac}} joint injections might be recommended to help combat symptoms. If chosen, a physician will inject a numbing agent, usually lidocaine, and a steroid containing powerful anti-inflammatory medication into the joint using fluoroscopic guidance. These steroid injections {{can be delivered}} up {{to three or four}} times a year and should be accompanied with physical therapy to help rehabilitate the affected joint.|$|E
50|$|In psoriatic arthritis, {{pain can}} occur {{in the area of}} the sacrum (the lower back, above the tailbone), as a result of <b>sacroiliitis</b> or spondylitis, which is present in 40% of cases.

50|$|Crohn's {{disease is}} {{associated}} with a type of rheumatologic disease known as seronegative spondyloarthropathy. This group of diseases is characterized by inflammation of one or more joints (arthritis) or muscle insertions (enthesitis). The arthritis in Crohn's disease can be divided into two types. The first type affects larger weight-bearing joints such as the knee (most common), hips, shoulders, wrists, or elbows. The second type symmetrically involves five or more of the small joints of the hands and feet. The arthritis may also involve the spine, leading to ankylosing spondylitis if the entire spine is involved or simply <b>sacroiliitis</b> if only the sacroiliac joint is involved. The symptoms of arthritis include painful, warm, swollen, stiff joints, and loss of joint mobility or function.|$|E

5000|$|Enthesitis {{can assist}} in {{differentiating}} arthritis mutilans' parent condition psoriatic arthritis from rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, with evidence in plain radiographs (x-rays) and MRI as periostitis, new bone formation, and bone erosions. Dactylitis, spondylitis and <b>sacroiliitis</b> are common with the parent condition psoriatic arthritis, but are not in rheumatoid arthritis. MRI bone edema scores are high in arthritis mutilans and correlate with radiographic measures of joint damage, although they may not correlate with disease activity. A source of significant pain, bone marrow edema (or lesions, using newer terminology), can be detected on MRI or with ultrasonography by signals of excessive water in bone marrow. Specifically, bone marrow edema can be detected within bone on T1-weighted images as poorly defined areas of low signal, with a high signal on T2-weighted fat-suppressed images. Comparatively, with arthritis mutilans in rheumatoid arthritis, bone marrow edema often involves the [...] bone layer, while the condition as a subtype of psoriatic arthritis includes a greater extent of marrow edema, expanding to diaphysis.|$|E
5000|$|This form {{accounts}} for about 50% of JIA cases, and usually involves the large joints such as the knees, ankles, and elbows, but smaller joints (such as the fingers and toes) may also be affected. The hip is not affected unlike polyarticular JIA. It is usually not symmetrical, meaning the affected joints are {{on one side of}} the body rather than on both sides simultaneously. Length discrepancy and muscle atrophy often happen, which leads to asymmetric growth and risk of flexion contracture. Early childhood onset patients are at risk for developing a chronic iridocyclitis or anterior uveitis, which is inflammation of the eye. This condition often goes unnoticed; therefore, these children should be closely monitored by an ophthalmologist. If ANA+, patient need routine eye exam every 3 months. If ANA- and older than 7 years, they can have eye exam every 6 months. [...] Children with late-onset oligoarticular JIA are at risk for <b>sacroiliitis</b> and spondyloarthropathy; late-onset oligoarticular JIA affects boys more often than girls and is associated with HLA-B27.|$|E

To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} utility of repeat sacroiliac joint computed tomography (CT) in <b>sacroiliitis</b> by assessing {{the proportion of}} patients changing from normal to pathologic at CT and to which degree there is progression of established <b>sacroiliitis</b> at repeat CT. Methods. In a retrospective analysis of 334 patients (median age 34 years) with symptoms suggestive of inflammatory back pain, CT had been performed twice, in 47 of these thrice, and in eight patients four times. The studies were scored as normal, equivocal, unilateral <b>sacroiliitis,</b> or bilateral <b>sacroiliitis.</b> Results. There was no change in 331 of 389 repeat examinations. Ten patients (3. 0 %) had progressed from normal or equivocal to unilateral or bilateral <b>sacroiliitis.</b> Of 43 cases with <b>sacroiliitis</b> on the first study, 36 (83. 7 %) progressed markedly. Two normal cases had changed to equivocal. Eight equivocal cases were classified as normal on the repeat study. In further two patients, only small changes within the scoring grade equivocal were detected. Conclusions. CT is a valuable examination for diagnosis of <b>sacroiliitis,</b> but a repeated examination detects only a few additional cases of <b>sacroiliitis.</b> Most cases with already established <b>sacroiliitis</b> showed progression of disease...|$|E
