500|$|After a {{productive}} 2011 season {{during which he}} [...] "excited fans" [...] and seemed like [...] "a <b>sure</b> <b>bet</b> to crack at least 25 (home runs) the following year and maybe drive in 100 runs", Mayberry's performance instead declined significantly, hitting just [...]245 (a 28-point drop), albeit with similar power numbers (14 home runs and 46 runs batted in compared to 15 and 49 respectively in 2011). After a poor start to the season, some sportswriters questioned whether the Phillies should have prioritized finding a left fielder in free agency to supplant him, who entered the season platooning in left field with Juan Pierre. Mayberry's slump continued into May – on May 1, he held a [...]204 batting average – and ultimately, Pierre excelled {{to the point that}} he became the de facto everyday starter, leaving Mayberry on the bench until late July, when the Phillies traded both Shane Victorino and Hunter Pence, forcing Mayberry to see action, predominantly in center field. Though he played well in August (batting [...]290), he struggled through September, and expectations were relatively low headed into the offseason. A season-in-review article from SBNation.com opined, [...] "(His) adequate defense at all three outfield positions makes him a decent fourth outfielder/bench bat, but at age 29 in 2013, the time for hoping that Mayberry finally puts his significant physical and intellectual gifts together to become an above-average Major League Baseball player appear to have gone completely." ...|$|E

The fast-paced, quickly changing gameplay is refreshingly unordinary, and while there's an excellent chance that fans of platformers will love the diversity and challenge, some may find it a little too restless and overdone." ...|$|E

Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to John William Corrington: [...] "Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How do you write, create?' You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: not to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or if you like its looks you make a pet out of it." [...] Bukowski was an atheist.|$|E

Reforms are infrequent events, undertaken in ambiguous second-best environments where bad reform outcomes are feasible.

50|$|To play, {{students}} must examine their hand to find cards in specific suits that have values {{they think are}} greater than their opponents. Some cards are <b>sure</b> <b>bets,</b> {{but only if the}} player can take the lead. Others have a high probability of taking a trick, but this depends upon how the cards are played by others. So, careful attention must be paid to the moves of other players. This leads to an involvement that improves social skills. Each player must also prepare his/her hand for the end of each round, where they must be sure that they have a card that won’t take an unwanted trick. The outcome of a hand is not determined {{until the end of the}} 8 rounds, so each player’s attention is kept riveted throughout each of the eight hands that comprise the game. Critical thinking must be applied to the process of taking, as well as avoiding, tricks. Every player will have a number of ways to play each hand, but finding the critical path to making exactly the right numbers of bids is the object of the game.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Huntington’s disease (HD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} {{disorder that}} produces a bias toward risky, reward-driven decisions in situations where the outcomes of decisions are uncertain and must be discovered. However, {{it is unclear whether}} HD patients show similar biases in decision-making when learning demands are minimized and prospective risks and outcomes are known explicitly. We investigated how risk decision-making strategies and adjustments are altered in HD patients when reward contingencies are explicit. Methods: HD (N= 18) and healthy control (HC; N= 17) participants completed a risk-taking task in which they made a series of independent choices between a low-risk/low reward and high-risk/high reward risk options. Results: Computational modeling showed that compared to HC, who showed a clear preference for low-risk compared to high-risk decisions, the HD group valued high-risks more than low-risk decisions, especially when high-risks were rewarded. The strategy analysis indicated that when high-risk options were rewarded, HC adopted a conservative risk strategy on the next trial by preferring the low-risk option (i. e., they counted their blessings and then played the <b>surer</b> <b>bet).</b> In contrast, following a rewarded high-risk choice, HD patients showed a clear preference for repeating the high-risk choice. Conclusions: These results indicate a pattern of high-risk/high-reward decision bias in HD that persists when outcomes and risks are certain. The allure of high-risk/high-reward decisions in situations of risk certainty and uncertainty expands our insight into the dynamic decision-making deficits that create considerable clinical burden in HD...|$|R

40|$|International {{trade has}} been {{a staple of the}} world economy for centuries. In today‟s world, as the {{pressure}} of globalization takes hold, and as {{the role of the state}} recedes while the role of regions increase, the need to maximize the benefits of international trade and investment inflows becomes even more accentuated. Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in particular, has perennially been on the periphery of global trade and investments, contributing no more than 3 - 4 %, notwithstanding SSA having proportionately much higher population and natural resource base. To improve SSA ability to be competitive in international trade as well as to multiply intra-african trade, the continent‟s leaders have long resorted to forming regional economic communities (RECs). But more than five decades of regional economic integration in SSA has produced mostly failed RECs. Yet regional integration is being touted as SSA <b>surest</b> <b>bet</b> for relevance in the global economy. Therein lies the paradox! How can an undertaking that have produced mostly failures be the self-same route out of global economic irrelevance? In this study, it is shown that the model for regional integration adopted by many SSA RECs, the linear model, also considered the Eurocentric model of regional integration, buttressed by an intergovernmental legal framework, does not suit the peculiar circumstances of the region and is the cause for the near total failure of regional integration on the continent. This research, using the ECOWAS specialized institutions as case studies – the West African Power Pool (WAPP) and the ECOWAS Regional Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERERA) – argues for a paradigm shift in the conceptualisation of regionalism on the continent. It argues for a shift to developmental regionalism, buttressed by strong supranational legal framework. The study shows that the West African regional bloc, ECOWAS, now recognises the nexus between the development of trade-related infrastructure and intra-african trade on the one hand, as well as the nexus between the development regionalism and the expansion of SSA trade with the rest of the world, on the other hand. Accordingly, the study concludes that ECOWAS institutionalization of a regional electricity market via the establishment of regional institutions of WAPP and ERERA is the new model for regional integration in SSA.

40|$|Political betting markets {{featured}} {{prominently in}} pre-election prognostication, perhaps more so {{ahead of the}} 2013 election than for any other recent Australian election. Major newspapers such as The Australian and the Australian Financial Review frequently reported {{on the state of}} the national betting markets, offering daily updates after the election date was announced. I routinely referenced the betting markets in weekly columns I was penning for the Guardian Australia. 1 The attention garnered by political betting markets is a relatively recent development. To be <b>sure,</b> political <b>betting</b> has been around for a long time in Australia; the survey by Rhode and Strumpf (2013) cites evidence of person-to-person wagering on colonial elections through to newspaper reports of relatively large wagers being placed on the 1949 Federal election. This is despite the fact that gambling on Federal elections has been illegal for most of the history of the Commonwealth. “Wagering on the result of any election ” remained on the list of electoral offences  until extensive amendments were made to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 2 in 1983. Political betting has since come out of the shadows.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{empirical}} work aimed at comparing evidential reasoning techniques. While there is {{prima facie evidence}} for some conclusions, this i 6 work in progress; the present focus is methodology, with the goal that subsequent results be meaningful. The domain is a network of UNIX* cycle servers, and the task is to predict properties {{of the state of}} the network from partial descriptions of the state. Actual data from the network are taken and used for blindfold testing in a betting game that allows abstention. The focal technique has been Kyburg's method for reasoning with data of varying relevance to a particular query, though the aim is to be able eventually to compare various uncertainty calculi. The conclusions are not novel, but are instructive. 1. All of the calculi performed better than human subjects, so unbiased access to sample experience is apparently of value. 2. Performance depends on metric: (a) when trials are repeated, net = gains - losses favors methods that place many bets, if the probability of placing a correct bet is sufficiently high; that is, it favors point-valued formalisms; (b) yield = gains/(gains + lossee) favors methods that <b>bet</b> only when <b>sure</b> to <b>bet</b> correctly; that is, it favors interval-valued formalisms. 3. Among the calculi, there were no clear winners or losers. Methods are identified for eliminating the bias of the net as a performance criterion and for separating the calculi effectively: in both cases by posting odds for the betting game in the appropriate way.
