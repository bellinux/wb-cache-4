5|$|Psoriasis {{can affect}} the nails and {{produces}} a variety {{of changes in the}} appearance of finger and toe nails. Nail psoriasis occurs in 40–45% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin and has a lifetime incidence of 80–90% in those with psoriatic arthritis. These changes include pitting of the nails (pinhead-sized depressions in the nail is seen in 70% with nail psoriasis), whitening of the nail, small areas of bleeding from capillaries under the nail, yellow-reddish discoloration of the nails known as the oil drop or salmon spot, thickening of the skin under the nail (<b>subungual</b> hyperkeratosis), loosening and separation of the nail (onycholysis), and crumbling of the nail.|$|E
25|$|Nails {{characterized}} by irregular longitudinal grooving and ridging of the nail plate, thinning of the nail plate, pterygium formation, shedding of the nail plate with atrophy of the nail bed, <b>subungual</b> keratosis, longitudinal erthronychia (red streaks), and <b>subungual</b> hyperpigmentation. A sand-papered appearance {{is present in}} around 10% of individuals with nail lichen planus.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{dermatitis}} problems for flower pickers, packers, florists and gardeners, [...] "daffodil itch", involves dryness, fissures, scaling, and erythema in the hands, often accompanied by <b>subungual</b> hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin beneath the nails). It is blamed on exposure to calcium oxalate, chelidonic acid or alkaloids such as lycorine in the sap, either due to a direct irritant effect or an allergic reaction. It has long been recognised that some cultivars provoke dermatitis more readily than others. N. pseudonarcissus and the cultivars [...] "Actaea", [...] "Camparelle", [...] "Gloriosa", [...] "Grande Monarque", [...] "Ornatus", [...] "Princeps" [...] and [...] "Scilly White" [...] are known to do so.|$|E
2500|$|In ancient times, holes were drilled into {{a person}} who was {{behaving}} in what was considered an abnormal way to let out what they believed were evil spirits. Evidence of trepanation has been found in prehistoric human remains from Neolithic times onward. Cave paintings indicate that people believed the practice would cure epileptic seizures, migraines, and mental disorders. The bone that was trepanned was kept by the prehistoric people and may have been worn as a charm to keep evil spirits away. [...] Evidence also suggests that trepanation was primitive emergency surgery after head wounds to remove shattered bits of bone from a fractured skull and clean out the blood that often pools under the skull after a blow to the head. [...] Such injuries were typical for primitive weaponry such as slings and war clubs. There is some contemporary use of the term. [...] In modern eye surgery, a trephine instrument is used in corneal transplant surgery. The procedure of drilling a hole through a fingernail or toenail is also known as trephination. It is performed by a physician or surgeon to relieve the pain associated with a <b>subungual</b> hematoma (blood under the nail); a small amount of blood is expressed through the hole and the pain associated with the pressure is partially alleviated.|$|E
50|$|There are two types, {{longitudinal}} and transverse melanonychia. Longitudinal melanonychia {{may be a}} sign of <b>subungual</b> melanoma (acral lentiginous melanoma), {{although there}} are other diagnoses such as chronic paronychia, onychomycosis, <b>subungual</b> hematoma, pyogenic granuloma, glomus tumour, <b>subungual</b> verruca, mucous cyst, <b>subungual</b> fibroma, keratoacanthoma, carcinoma of the nail bed, and <b>subungual</b> exostosis.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Subungual</b> or periungual warts form {{under the}} {{fingernail}} (<b>subungual),</b> around the fingernail, {{or on the}} cuticle (periungual). They {{are more difficult to}} treat than warts in other locations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Subungual</b> hematomas {{typically}} heal without incident, though {{infection or}} {{disruption of the}} nail (onycholysis) may occur.|$|E
50|$|Proximal <b>subungual</b> onychomycosis is an {{infection}} of the nail plate by fungus, primarily affecting the proximal nailfold.|$|E
50|$|Distal <b>subungual</b> onychomycosis is an {{infection}} of the nail plate by fungus, primarily involving the distal nail plate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Subungual</b> exostoses are bony {{projections}} which {{arise from}} the dorsal surface of the distal phalanx, most commonly of the hallux.|$|E
50|$|Melanonychia (longitudinal {{streaking}} that darkens or {{does not}} grow out), especially on the thumb or big toe, may indicate <b>subungual</b> melanoma.|$|E
50|$|Solitary glomus tumors, {{particularly}} <b>subungual</b> lesions, {{are more}} common in females than in males. Multiple lesions are slightly more common in males.|$|E
5000|$|Chromonychia is a {{term used}} to {{indicate}} an [...] in color of the substance or surface of the nail plate or <b>subungual</b> tissues.|$|E
50|$|<b>Subungual</b> hematoma {{occurs when}} {{trauma to the}} nail results in a {{collection}} of blood, or hematoma, under the nail. It may result from an acute injury or from repeated minor trauma such as running in undersized shoes. Acute <b>subungual</b> hematomas are quite painful, and are usually treated by releasing the blood by creating a small hole in the nail. Drilling and thermal cautery are common methods for creating the hole. Thermal cautery is not used on acrylic nails because they are flammable.|$|E
50|$|Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} of the nailbed is uncommon, and often mistaken for a pyogenic granuloma initially. <b>Subungual</b> melanoma is frequently diagnosed late {{in the course of}} growth.|$|E
5000|$|Distal <b>subungual</b> onychomycosis is {{the most}} common form of tinea unguium and is usually caused by Trichophyton rubrum, which invades the nail bed and the {{underside}} of the nail plate.|$|E
5000|$|Koenen's tumor (also {{known as}} [...] "Koenen's periungual fibroma" [...] and [...] "Periungual fibroma") is a {{cutaneous}} condition {{that results in}} fifty percent of tuberous sclerosis cases.It can be <b>subungual</b> too.|$|E
50|$|Parakeratosis pustulosa is a {{cutaneous}} condition {{which is}} exclusively seen in children, usually involving one finger, most commonly the thumb or index finger, with the affected nail showing <b>subungual</b> hyperkeratosis and onycholysis.|$|E
50|$|A <b>subungual</b> hematoma is a {{collection}} of blood (hematoma) underneath a toenail or fingernail (black toenail). It can be extremely painful for an injury of its size, although otherwise it is not a serious medical condition.|$|E
5000|$|Proximal <b>subungual</b> onychomycosis is fungal {{penetration}} of the newly formed nail plate through the proximal nail fold. It is the least common form of tinea unguium in healthy people, but is found more commonly when the patient is immunocompromised.|$|E
50|$|The {{condition}} also {{results from}} a traumatic injury, such as slamming a finger in a door, or from sports activities, such as climbing or hiking rugged terrain. A <b>subungual</b> hematoma that results from the repetitive thrusting of the longest toe into a shoe's toe box is called jogger's toe or runner's toe.|$|E
50|$|Onychophosis is a {{localized}} or diffuse hyperkeratotic {{tissue that}} develops on the lateral or proximal nailfolds, within {{the space between}} the nailfolds and the nail plate, and is a common finding in the elderly. Onychophosis may involve the <b>subungual</b> area, {{as a direct result of}} repeated minor trauma, and most frequently affects the first and fifth toes.|$|E
5000|$|Clinical {{presentation}} of the common trichinosis symptoms may also suggest infection. These symptoms include eye puffiness, splinter hemorrhage, nonspecific gastroenteritis, and muscle pain. The case definition for trichinosis at the European Center for Disease Control states [...] "at least three of the following six: fever, muscle soreness and pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, facial edema, eosinophilia, and subconjuctival, <b>subungual,</b> and retinal hemorrhages." ...|$|E
5000|$|Healthcare {{providers}} may use podiatry drills on onychauxic (thickened) nails {{of patients}} to alleviate or eliminate pain, prevent or treat <b>subungual</b> ulcerations, allow better penetration of topical antifungal agents, or improve cosmesis, all in {{effort to improve}} the patient’s “quality of life.” [...] In {{a study conducted by}} Miller, 65% of respondents reported routinely drilling thickened toenails. However, the improved effectiveness of antifungal drugs such as itraconazole and terbinafine reduces the need to drill these infected nails.|$|E
50|$|<b>Subungual</b> hematomas {{are treated}} by either {{releasing}} the pressure conservatively when tolerable or by {{drilling a hole}} through the nail into the hematoma (trephining), or by removing the entire nail. Trephining is generally accomplished by using a heated instrument {{to pass through the}} nail into the blood clot. Removal of the nail is typically done when the nail itself is disrupted, a large laceration requiring suturing is suspected, or a fracture of the tip of the finger occurs. Although general anesthesia is generally not required, a digital nerve block is recommended to be performed if the nail is to be removed.|$|E

5000|$|The Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) is a numeric, reproducible, objective, simple {{tool for}} {{evaluation}} of nail psoriasis. [...] It evaluates several signs separately, each on a 1-3 scale: pitting, Beau's lines, <b>subungual</b> hyperkeratosis and onycholysis. A 2005 study proposed a modified NAPSI scale for persons with psoriasis and named the title of their publication [...] "Modification of the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index". [...] Then, in 2007, a study {{found that there was}} a high level of inter-rater variability of the 2003 NAPSI scale and proposed another index which was, like the 2005 article, a modification of the 2003 article, and was named modified NAPSI.A 2008 study found that Cannavo's qualitative system correlated with NAPSI (P<0.001) and is less time-consuming.There is a risk of misdiagnosis with onychomycosis.|$|E

Evidence also suggests that trepanation was primitive emergency surgery after head wounds to remove shattered bits of bone from a fractured skull and clean out the blood that often pools under the skull after a blow to the head, which is called a subdural hematoma. Such injuries were typical for primitive weaponry such as slings and war clubs. There is some contemporary use of the term.

5000|$|The running shoe {{itself has}} also been {{examined}} as a possible cause of many injuries associated with shod running. One 1991 study found that wearers of expensive running shoes that are promoted as having special features, such as added cushioning or pronation correction, were injured significantly more frequently than runners wearing inexpensive shoes. It {{has also been}} found that running in conventional running shoes increases stress on the knee joints up to 38%, although it is still unclear if {{this leads to a}} higher rate of heel injuries or not. One study suggests that {{there is no evidence that}} cushioning or pronation control in shoes reduces injury rates or reduces performance. It was also found that the belief that one's shoes have increased cushioning had no effect on increasing or decreasing ground reaction forces during walking. Modern running shoes can also increase joint torque at the hip, knee, and ankle, and the authors of the study even suggest that running in high heels might be better than modern running shoes. Improperly fitting shoes may also result in injuries such as a <b>subungual</b> hematoma [...] - [...] a collection of blood underneath the toenail. This may also be known as [...] "runner's toe" [...] or [...] "tennis toe". However, a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggested that heavier runners might be at an increased risk for injury in minimalist shoes (designed to mimic barefoot running) as compared to conventional footwear.|$|E

40|$|<b>Subungual</b> {{melanoma}} is a rare, {{but one of}} the diagnostically {{most difficult}} variants of melanoma.  Unfortunately, due to its late detection, lack of an early reaction from the patient and diagnosis in advanced stages, <b>subungual</b> melanoma is deemed as a prognostically unfavorable variant of this malignancy. Diagnosis of <b>subungual</b> melanoma is very difficult to establish merely on the basis of clinical examination due to the resemblance of <b>subungual</b> hematoma to melanocytic nevus, fungal or bacterial infections. Dermoscopy seems to be the ideal diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis of this life-threatening disease. Aims. To describe the basic aspects of dermoscopy of <b>subungual</b> melanoma and other conditions involving the nails.  Methods. Review of medical database PubMed for the literature of the last 10 years on the dermoscopic patterns of <b>subungual</b> melanoma and other <b>subungual</b> diseases.  Results. We collate the fundamental rules of performing dermoscopy in <b>subungual</b> melanoma, as well as basic dermoscopic features and diagnostic algorithms of selected <b>subungual</b> lesions requiring differentiation from melanoma.  Conclusions. Dermoscopy is a safe, easily repeatable diagnostic method, and the knowledge of basic dermoscopic patterns of developing melanoma in <b>subungual</b> localization, along with the differential diagnosis of other diseases within the nail plate, will help not only dermatologists, but also the professionals of other specialties, such as surgeons, oncologists, orthopedists, and also general practitioners...|$|E
