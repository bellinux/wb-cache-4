5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 21 June a force of about 50 Japanese troops <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pocket and {{attempted}} to attack Australian positions on Labuan. Different groups of Japanese troops attacked a prisoner of war enclosure, dock facilities and No. 1 Strip, but all were defeated by Australian and American logistics personnel and engineers. A total of 32 Japanese personnel were killed around Victoria, and another 11 were killed at the airfield. Three Americans and two Australians were killed in these engagements.|$|E
5|$|After another bright start, Oxford led {{the table}} {{several times in}} the first half of the 2013–14 season. On 25 January 2014, with the club faltering though still in the {{play-off}} places, Wilder resigned as manager to take up the reins at relegation-threatened Northampton. Mickey Lewis subsequently became the caretaker manager for a second time for the club. On 22 March 2014, Gary Waddock was appointed the head coach of the club after a lengthy interview process, leaving his job as Head of Coaching at MK Dons. Under Lewis and Waddock, Oxford <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play-off places in the final few weeks of the season, finishing a disappointing eighth in the table, nine points off the last playoff place.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{depicts a}} scene from the first book of the Histories by Herodotus. Candaules, king of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, {{believed}} his wife Nyssia to be the world's most beautiful woman. He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, but felt Gyges was lying when he told him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his bedroom door and secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the door and watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as he <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room afterwards, but remained silent.|$|E

5|$|Graham's {{replacement}} was Glaswegian John Docherty. In {{his second}} season as manager, Millwall won the Second Division championship and gained promotion to the top flight of English football {{for the first time}} in the club's history. Starting the 1988–89 season strongly, Millwall topped the league on 1 October 1988 having played six games (winning four and drawing two) and rarely <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top five before Christmas. This was mainly due to Tony Cascarino and Teddy Sheringham, who scored 99 goals between them in three seasons playing together. Millwall's first top division season ended with a tenth-place finish, which was the lowest place occupied by the club all season. The following season, they briefly led the league for one night in September 1989 after beating Coventry City 4–1, but won only two more games all season and were relegated in 20th place at the end of the 1989–90 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the French attempts to reach the Caribbean ended in failure. Several ships were intercepted in the Bay of Biscay, while others reached the Caribbean, only to be defeated by ships from Cochrane's squadron, which was focused on preparations for the invasion of Martinique, planned for February. Only two ships reached the islands safely, the 40–gun frigates Junon at Guadeloupe and Amphitrite at Martinique. By February 1809, Martinique was under attack, distracting most of the available British ships from the blockade of Guadeloupe. Taking advantage of the temporary absence of enemy shipping, Junon <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Îles des Saintes {{to the south of}} Guadeloupe on 4 February and sailed north. The French captain, Jean-Baptiste-Augustin Rousseau, had dropped off his military and food supplies and taken on board large quantities of trade goods for sale in France in an effort to revive the Guadeloupe economy.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Tang <b>slipped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, however, the entire Nanking Garrison Force was rapidly {{disintegrating}} with some units in open flight. Furthermore, contact {{had already been}} lost with many units who thus never received Tang's message and continued to hold their positions as ordered, though even those that did receive it had little luck at slipping through the Japanese lines. China's 66th and 83rd Corps made a bid to evade the Japanese as planned through a gap to the east but immediately ran into their own minefield. After that they were attacked in flight by Japanese units and lost two divisional chiefs of staff in combat. Though the two corps had started the battle at least 11,000 men strong, only 600 of them escaped Nanking. Near dawn on December 13 a portion of China's 74th Corps was also annihilated {{in a bid to}} break through Japanese lines along the Yangtze River south of Nanking.|$|E

More than writing his theses, Luther's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope.
