40|$|Miss Jeanne Strohmeier, Textiles and Clothing Sr., {{organized}} the first College Shop {{for a large}} department store in Evanston, Illinois, while employed there during the summer months. Her first job was to interest other people in her new project.

5000|$|According to Howard, as {{published}} in 1904, [...] "by Chinese law ... when the wife {{is guilty of}} adultery .... if the woman not be slain, ... the husband may ... <b>sell</b> <b>her</b> as a concubine, provided he has not pandered to the crime or does not <b>sell</b> <b>her</b> to the guilty man." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{captured}} frigates were valuable prizes but the Royal Navy only acquired Medée, {{which it}} took into service as HMS Medee, which it never commissioned but instead {{used as a}} prison ship {{for a few years}} before <b>selling</b> <b>her</b> in 1805. The frigates had come into port shortly before the Peace of Amiens and thus were deemed surplus to Navy requirements. The ships and their stores and equipment were sold privately; the proceeds from the sale were paid as prize money in February 1803. The British crews also benefited from head-money, a financial award for each French sailor captured during the engagement.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{supported}} by Irish Catholics {{in his effort}} to regain the thrones, James launched an expedition to Ireland in March 1689. He abandoned it upon his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. During James's campaign, Mary supported his cause throughout the British Isles: she sent three French supply ships to Bantry Bay and £2,000 to Jacobite rebels in Dundee. She financed those measures by <b>selling</b> <b>her</b> jewellery. Money problems plagued the Stuart court-in-exile, despite a substantial pension from Louis XIV of 50,000 livres. Mary tried her best to assist those of her husband's followers living in poverty, and encouraged her children to give part of their pocket money to Jacobite refugees.|$|E
5|$|In Zoha Prison in Romania, {{there are}} {{interviews}} with traffickers serving prison sentences {{that the film}} suggested were too short {{in light of the}} severity of the crime of human trafficking. The typical sentence for this crime is six or seven years, while the sentence for trafficking in drugs is normally twenty years. Two Romanian traffickers, Traian and Ovidiu, attest to having starved, punched, and kicked the girls they trafficked. Ovidiu recounts a story, in an interview filmed in February 2007, about kidnapping a prostitute and <b>selling</b> <b>her</b> for sex when he was 14. He expresses no remorse for these actions. The sentences served by Traian and Ovidiu were short enough that, by the time the film was released, they were no longer in prison. Ana, a girl they trafficked, is also interviewed in the film, saying that she lost a tooth in one of her beatings. She describes being pregnant at the time, but not telling this to her captors because of fears for the unborn child's safety.|$|E

5|$|Once Upon a Child {{purchases}} and sells used children's attire and toys. The first Once Upon a Child store was opened in 1985 in Perrysburg, Ohio, by Dennis and Lynn Blum in 1985 after they observed Goodwill Industries accepting and selling used baby attire. Prior to opening a store, Judy Blum had been <b>selling</b> <b>her</b> three sons' and friends' and neighbors' clothing {{in a garage}} sale from her house every week. Her husband resigned from his employment in 1989 to work with Judy. Winmark purchased the company in 1992. In 2009, roughly 10% of Once Upon a Child's children's attire and playthings purchased were new. In 2011, it had 240 locations in the United States and 24 in Canada. In 2010, the complete cost to start a Once Upon a Child was between $200,000 and $250,000 and the average yearly sales were between $650,000 and $725,000.|$|E

25|$|In 1829, the family's textile {{business}} failed. Martineau, then 27 years old, {{stepped out}} of the traditional roles of feminine propriety to earn a living for her family. Along with her needlework, she began <b>selling</b> <b>her</b> articles to the Monthly Repository, earning accolades, including three essay prizes from the Unitarian Association. Her regular work with the Repository helped establish her as a reliable and popular freelance writer.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, she {{developed}} and marketed an eponymous perfume, using {{the proceeds to}} help finance her project. The perfume bottle top featured a small sculpture of two intertwined snakes, one golden and the other brightly multicolored. She may have raised {{as much as a}} third of the funds she needed for the garden in this way. She actively solicited funding from friends and acquaintances, as well as by <b>selling</b> <b>her</b> artworks.|$|E

25|$|Gloire was a ship {{launched}} at Bayonne in 1799 as {{an armed}} merchantman. She became a privateer in the Indian Ocean that the British captured in 1801 in a notable single-ship action and named HMS Trincomalee, but then sold in 1803. The French recaptured her in 1803 and recommissioned {{her as the}} privateer Émilien, but the British recaptured her in 1807 and recommissioned her as HMS Emilien, before <b>selling</b> <b>her</b> in 1808.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} {{to draw a line}} between the aristocratic lady and the wandering vǫlva, but Old Norse sources present the vǫlva as more professional and she went from estate to estate <b>selling</b> <b>her</b> spiritual services. The vǫlva had greater authority than the aristocratic lady, but both were ultimately dependent on the benevolence of the warlord that they served. When they had been attached to a warlord, their authority depended on their personal competence and credibility.|$|E
25|$|Both Theophilus and Susannah Maria {{were members}} of the Drury Lane theatre company managed by Cibber. From 1735, Cibber began drawing his wife's {{earnings}} from the theatre personally, ignoring the marriage settlement, and by 1737 he was even <b>selling</b> <b>her</b> clothes and personal effects to make money. In 1738, the couple were involved in a notorious lawsuit which drew public attention to Cibber's connivance in his wife's adultery. The Cibbers had established a ménage à trois with John Sloper, a country squire, from whom Theophilus accepted money. The three of them set up house together in Kensington, for which Sloper paid the rent and maintenance, until Cibber slipped away to France to escape his creditors. To his dismay, Susannah Maria wrote him a letter to say that she was leaving him for Sloper.|$|E

25|$|Murtaja {{was often}} criticized for her poor {{performance}} in difficult ice conditions and she was deemed old and obsolete already in 1906. <b>Selling</b> <b>her</b> was set as a prerequisite for ordering a new icebreaker, but while several foreign ports were interested in purchasing Murtaja, in September 1906 the Senate decided to order the third state-owned icebreaker, Tarmo, without selling the old one. As more modern icebreakers entered service in the 1920s, Murtaja was again deemed obsolete and worn-out, and she was criticized for her high operating costs. She {{was said to be}} in need of complete overhaul and rebuilding in 1926, but the Finnish Board of Navigation did not agree to this until almost ten years later, although it noted that decommissioning her would probably be a better solution.|$|E
25|$|United Artists {{broke from}} this tradition. It was solely a {{distribution}} company, offering independent film producers {{access to its}} own screens {{as well as the}} rental of temporarily unbooked cinemas owned by other companies. Pickford and Fairbanks produced and shot their films after 1920 at the jointly owned Pickford-Fairbanks studio on Santa Monica Boulevard. The producers who signed with UA were true independents, producing, creating and controlling their work to an unprecedented degree. As a co-founder, as well as the producer and star of her own films, Pickford became the most powerful woman who has ever worked in Hollywood. By 1930, Pickford's acting career had largely faded. After retiring three years later, however, she continued to produce films for United Artists. She and Chaplin remained partners in the company for decades. Chaplin left the company in 1955, and Pickford followed suit in 1956, <b>selling</b> <b>her</b> remaining shares for three million dollars.|$|E
25|$|After her divorce, Maria Pavlovna {{continued}} to work in Paris, but she moved to Boulogne, the south west suburb of Paris, where many Russians had taken residence. She began an affair with the famous fashion designer Jean Patou, who was {{ten years older than}} her and with a large fortune. They lived with great luxury appearing together in Parisian society events and spending time in Biarritz, Deauville and on the French Riviera. Rumors of a possible marriage between them spread in 1925, but Patou, a consummated bachelor, was reluctant to change his lifestyle. In 1926, Kitmirs business began to decline. In 1928, as embroidery began to be out of fashion, Maria Pavlovva sold her workshop. Having suffered a defeat, but not surrendering, the grand duchess moved to London in the spring 1928 where she started <b>selling</b> <b>her</b> own perfume, Prince Igor, {{following in the footsteps of}} Chanel No. 5 and Patou's perfume Joy. Failings in advertising and distribution made that Prince Igor was not a success. Undeterred, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna emigrated to the United States hoping for a new start. On 8 December 1928, she set sail for America from Le Havre.|$|E
