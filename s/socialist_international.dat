5|$|In 1907, the Dashnaktsutiun {{joined the}} Second International until its {{dissolution}} during World War I. It later joined the reformed <b>Socialist</b> <b>International</b> and remained a full member until 1960, when {{it decided to}} pull out of the organization. In 1996, it was re-accepted as an observer member, and in 1999 the Dashnaks earned full membership in the international organization.

5|$|After the International Workingmen's Association disbanded in 1876, several {{attempts}} were made to revive the organisation, culminating {{in the formation of the}} <b>Socialist</b> <b>International</b> (Second International) in 1889. This, in turn, was disbanded in 1916 following disagreements over World War I. Although the organisation reformed in 1923 as the Labour and <b>Socialist</b> <b>International,</b> supporters of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks had already set up the Communist International (Comintern), which they regarded as the Third International. This was organised on a democratic centralist basis, with component parties required to fight for policies adopted by the body as a whole.|$|E

5|$|The use of violence, {{with scores}} dead and injured, is totally {{incompatible}} with the policies and principles of any social democratic party anywhere in the world. Consequently, we consider that a party in government that does not listen, that does not move {{and that does not}} immediately initiate a process of meaningful change in these circumstances, cannot {{be a member of the}} <b>Socialist</b> <b>International.</b> We are, as of today, ceasing the membership of the NDP, however we remain determined to cooperate with all the democrats in Egypt striving to achieve an open, democratic, inclusive and secular state.|$|E
5|$|In late 1918, the British Labour Party {{called for}} the {{establishment}} of an international conference of socialist parties, the Labour and <b>Socialist</b> <b>International.</b> Lenin saw this as a revival of the Second International, which he had despised, and formulated his own rival international socialist conference to offset its impact. Organised with the aid of Zinoviev, Trotsky, Christian Rakovsky, and Angelica Balabanoff, the First Congress of this Communist International ("Comintern") opened in Moscow in March 1919. It lacked global coverage; of the 34 assembled delegates, 30 resided within the countries of the former Russian Empire, and most of the international delegates were not recognised by any socialist parties in their own nations. Accordingly, the Bolsheviks dominated proceedings, with Lenin subsequently authoring a series of regulations that meant that only socialist parties endorsing the Bolsheviks' views were permitted to join Comintern. During the first conference, Lenin spoke to the delegates, lambasting the parliamentary path to socialism espoused by revisionist Marxists like Kautsky and repeating his calls for a violent overthrow of Europe's bourgeoisie governments. While Zinoviev became Comintern's President, Lenin retained significant influence over it.|$|E
