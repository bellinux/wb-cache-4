In Blum & Ritter’s study in West Germany (1990), they found that 27% of their population had only minor issues, 72% had a palpable mass at the site, and 23% reported pain and other signs of inflammation such as hyperthermia, pulsation, and cystic, pustular, or papular lesions. Size of masses were an average of 2 cm in diameter ranging up to 4 cm, some being associated with purulent drainage, continuous discharge, and crusting.

30|$|Septic {{arthritis}} is {{an emergency}} comprising 21  % of acute pediatric musculoskeletal infections [1], with a reported incidence of 5 – 12 cases per 100, 000 person-years [2].

With few exceptions, once identified, these patients undergo incision and drainage (I&D) of the affected joint and begin intravenous antibiotics. The majority of children improve after a single I&D and a 3 – 6 -week course of antibiotics. However, similar to adult populations [11, 12, 13], a subset of children require multiple operative procedures for resolution of infection.|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Laparoscopic ovarian {{cystectomy}} and appendectomy {{during the}} early second trimester have been widely reported. However, the use of both procedures in advanced gestation is rare. We propose a minilaparoscopic approach for performing these 2 procedures in a woman 24 -weeks pregnant. Methods: We describe the case and laparoscopic management of acute abdominal pain at the 24 th week of pregnancy. Microlaparoscopy under ultrasound guidance {{was used for the}} first trocar insertion to prevent injury to the uterus. It was followed by minilaparoscopic ovarian cystectomy and appendectomy. Results: Premature contractions occurred after the operation, but they were controlled with a single tocolytic agent, and an apparently healthy female baby was born uneventfully via Cesarean delivery at 41 weeks of gestation. Conclusion: Minilaparoscopic ovarian cystectomy and appendectomy can be carried out in the late second trimester without <b>serious</b> <b>sequela...</b>|$|R
40|$|Calyceal-cutaneous fistula is a <b>serious</b> <b>sequela</b> of renal {{transplantation}} {{occurring in}} approximately 3 % of allografts. This complication occurred in 12 % of allografts with multiple renal arteries. A localized area of poor parenchymal perfusion involving less than one-eighth of the kidney was noted {{at the time}} of transplantation in only one-third of the kidneys developing fistulae. Attempts of surgical correction of the fistulae in the presence of serious wound and urinary tract sepsis were usually unsuccessful, with the ultimate loss of 7 of 8 kidneys and the death of 3 patients from sepsis. One individual underwent successful partial resection and closure of the fistula with a muscular graft and survives with adequate function. This experience would suggest that if an initial aggressive surgical attempt at repairing a calyceal-cutaneous fistula fails, transplant nephrectomy should be performed...|$|R

40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{study of the}} medical records of 46 patients, comprising our SLE population over a 6 -year period, noted that mortality (7 of 46 : 15. 2 %) was {{directly related to the}} adult respiratory distress syndrome. In five, a concomitant severe infection was detected. Overall, 17 of our 46 patients presented with infectious episodes. The only statistically significant factor predisposing to both infection and the adult respiratory distress syndrome was high dose corticosteroid adminis-tration. Our results suggest that adult respiratory distress syndrome is a clinical condition related to the death of lupus patients and commonly complicates infection. KEY WORDS: Infection, Death, Lung, Corticosteroids VARIOUS clinical conditions have been blamed for the death of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including infections, renal failure, neurological complications and late, steroid related, atherosclerotic disease [1, 2].

40|$|Abstract Background Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis (SJS/TEN) {{is a rare}} but {{severe and}} sometimes fatal condition associated with exposure to medications; sulfamethoxazole {{is among the most}} common causes. We sought to address the safety of acetazolamide, a chemically related compound, in patients with prior SJS/TEN and glaucoma. A retrospective case series is described of patients at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary who underwent keratoprosthesis surgery for corneal blindness from SJS/TEN, and later required oral acetazolamide for elevated intraocular pressure. Findings Over the last 10 [*]years, 17 patients with SJS/TEN received a Boston keratoprosthesis. Of these, 11 developed elevated intraocular pressure that required administration of oral acetazolamide. One of 11 developed a mild allergic reaction, but no patient experienced a recurrence of SJS/TEN or any severe adverse reaction. Conclusion Although an increase in the rate of recurrent SJS/TEN due to oral acetazolamide would not necessarily be apparent after treating only 11 patients, in our series, acetazolamide administration was well tolerated without <b>serious</b> <b>sequela.</b> </p...|$|R
