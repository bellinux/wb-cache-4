5|$|Today {{herbs are}} {{typically}} {{thought of as}} culinary plants, but in the traditional cottage garden they {{were considered to be}} any plant with household uses. Herbs were used for medicine, toiletries, and cleaning products. Scented herbs would be spread on the floor along with rushes to cover odors. Some herbs were used for dyeing fabrics. Traditional cottage garden herbs included sage, thyme, southernwood, wormwood, catmint, feverfew, lungwort, soapwort, hyssop, <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff,</b> and lavender.|$|E
6000|$|Frida {{had no such}} fanatical {{respect for}} the bogey of vested {{interests}} as her superstitious brother, so she mounted the gate gracefully--she was always graceful. Bertram took her small hand and jumped {{her down on the}} other side, while Philip, not liking to show himself less bold than a woman in this matter, climbed over it after her, though with no small misgivings. They strolled on into the wood, picking the pretty white orchids by the way as they went, for some little distance. The rich mould underfoot was thick with <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff</b> and trailing loosestrife. Every now and again, as they stirred the lithe brambles that encroached upon the path, a pheasant rose from the ground with a loud whir-r-r before them. Philip felt most uneasy. [...] "You'll have the keepers after you in a minute," [...] he said, with a deprecating shrug. [...] "This is just full nesting time. They're down upon anybody who disturbs the pheasants." ...|$|E
50|$|This ancient wood has coppiced ash and hornbeam, {{together}} with maple, hazel and oak. Flora include dog’s mercury, sanicle and the uncommon <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff.</b>|$|E
60|$|The spinney opened out; the ferns were serenely uncoiling, the bluebells stood grouped {{with blue}} curls mingled. In the freer spaces forget-me-nots flowered in nebulæ, and dog-violets gave an {{undertone}} of dark purple, with primroses for planets in the night. There {{was a slight}} drift of <b>woodruff,</b> <b>sweet</b> new-mown hay, scenting the air under the boughs. On a wet bank was the design of golden saxifrage, glistening unholily as if varnished by its minister, the snail. George and Lettie crushed the veined belles of wood-sorrel and broke the silken mosses. What did it matter to them what they broke or crushed.|$|R
40|$|Coumarin is a {{naturally}} occurring flavouring substance which {{is contained in}} many plants (for example <b>woodruff,</b> <b>sweet</b> clover, tonka beans). Higher concentrations {{are to be found}} particularly in some types of cinnamon. Coumarin is used as a fragrance substance in cosmetics and is an active substance in medicinal products. For a few years cinnamon-containing food supplements have also been on sale which are said to reduce the blood sugar level and the blood lipid concentrations of diabetics. Because of the harmful effect of larger amounts – coumarin can cause hepatic damage – coumarin may only be used as an ingredient of flavourings and other food additives with flavouring properties in the food sector. What's more, it has long been known that in animal experiments coumarin can trigger the formation of tumours. More recent scientific findings indicate that there is no genotoxic mechanism of action, something which had been suspected for a long time. The European Commission thereupon submitted a draft amendment to the Flavourings Directive which envisages removing the existing constraints on coumarin. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) took another look at coumarin from the angle of consumer health protection. BfR is of the opinion that dietary coumarin intake should continue to be restricted. In order to avoid high coumarin exposure from direct consumption (e. g. rice pudding with cinnamon and sugar) statutory measures are also desirable...|$|R
50|$|The upper {{edges of}} the reserve were not quarried and the area {{supports}} ancient woodland flowers such as wood anemone, wood sorrel, primrose, <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff,</b> greater butterfly-orchid, herb paris and bluebell.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{trees in}} this ancient wood, on wet chalky clay, are pedunculate oaks. The ground flora is diverse, including locally uncommon {{species such as}} broad-leaved helleborine and <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff.</b> There {{are a variety of}} mosses and ferns.|$|E
5000|$|Teague Moriarty (born April 21, 1983) is an American chef {{best known}} for holding a Michelin star at his San Francisco {{restaurant}} called Sons & Daughters. He has since opened The Square and <b>Sweet</b> <b>Woodruff,</b> also in San Francisco.|$|E
50|$|Despite of {{transformation}} of the basic tree vegetation, the same form of undergrowth survived. There occurs: daphne mezereum, red elderberry, hazel, platanthera bifolia, <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff,</b> herb paris, cranberry, wood sorrel, chickweed wintergreen, Common Cow-wheat and lily of the valley. The parts over 800 m are mainly covered with grasses, purple small-reeds, cranberries, and willow gentian.|$|E
50|$|A {{herbaceous}} plant, {{it grows}} to 30 - 50 cm long, often lying {{flat on the}} ground or supported by other plants. Its vernacular names include woodruff, <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff,</b> and wild baby's breath; master of the woods would be a literal translation of the German Waldmeister. It is sometimes confused with Galium triflorum and Galium verum.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 80% of {{the tree}} canopy is beech and is managed for timber. Other trees present are ash and whitebeam. Holly, yew and hazel, and {{regenerating}} beech and ash, form the scrub layer. Bramble and <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff</b> are present and rare plants such as white helleborine, broad-leaved helleborine, columbine and common wintergreen. Woodland flora also includes lesser periwinkle, bluebell, yellow archangel and early purple orchid.|$|E

5000|$|Dipteryx odorata (commonly {{known as}} [...] "cumaru" [...] or [...] "kumaru") is {{a species of}} {{flowering}} tree in the pea family, Fabaceae. The tree is native to Central America and northern South America. Its seeds are known as tonka beans (sometimes tonkin beans or tonquin beans). They are black and wrinkled and have a smooth, brown interior. They have a strong fragrance similar to <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff</b> (Galium odoratum) due to their high content of coumarin.|$|E
50|$|Coumarin {{is found}} {{naturally}} in many plants, notably in high {{concentration in the}} tonka bean (Dipteryx odorata), vanilla grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff</b> (Galium odoratum), mullein (Verbascum spp.), sweet grass (Hierochloe odorata), cassia cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia) {{not to be confused}} with true cinnamon ("Ceylon cinnamon", Cinnamomum zeylanicum which contains little coumarin), sweet-clover (Melilotus sp.), deertongue (Dichanthelium clandestinum), and the leaves of many cherry blossom tree varieties (of the Prunus genus). Coumarin is also found in extracts of Justicia pectoralis.|$|E
50|$|Pastis Henri Bardouin is a French pastis made by Distilleries et Domaines de Provence. It {{contains}} more than 65 different herbs and spices, including mugwort, star anise, centaury, grains of paradise, cardamom, black and white pepper, tonka bean, nutmeg, cloves, garden angelica, cinnamon, lemon balm, sage, rosemary, licorice, thyme, lemon verbena, <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff,</b> coriander, borage, wall germander, St John's wort, kidney vetch, wild thyme, chamomile, melilot, oregano, large leaved lime and fennel.

50|$|Legbourne Wood {{is one of}} the few {{remaining}} ancient woodlands in eastern Lincolnshire and the largest of the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust woodland nature reserves. The Trust bought the wood in 2004. The canopy at Legbourne is ash and oak. Beneath the trees, over 60 species of wildflowers have been recorded including primrose, early purple orchid, bluebell, wood anemone, <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff,</b> wood sorrel and lesser celandine. There is a varied bird population, including one of the largest heronries in the county.|$|E
50|$|The 67 hectare {{site is a}} steeply sided valley {{with large}} areas of {{grassland}} and wooded slopes. The diverse chalk grasslands on the eastern and north-western sides are rich in many species of herb which are uncommon in London, and the nationally scarce man orchid and round-headed rampion have also been recorded. Devilsden Wood {{on the western side}} has a canopy of ash, oak and hazel. Trees such as midland hawthorn and plants such as <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff</b> are characteristic of ancient woodlands.|$|E
50|$|Some {{flowers are}} safe to eat only {{in small amounts}}. Apple flowers (Malus spp.) contain cyanide {{precursors}} and Johnny jump-ups (Viola tricolor) contain saponins. Borage (Borago officinalis) and daylily (Hemerocallis spp.) flowers are diuretics and <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff</b> (Galium odoratum) can have blood-thinning effects. The flowers of linden trees (Tilia spp.) are reportedly safe in small amounts but heavy consumption can cause heart damage. Marigolds (Tagetes spp.) can be harmful in large amounts, and only certain species have an appealing flavor.|$|E
50|$|May wine, {{also known}} as Maitrank, Maiwein, Maibowle and Waldmeisterbowle, {{is the name of}} a German {{beverage}} that uses aromatized wine as a base (see sangría). May wine is served in the spring, traditionally on the May Day holiday. The base is made by steeping the fragrant creeping herb <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff</b> (Galium odoratum, sometimes called Asperula odorata, known in Germany as Waldmeister) that grows in the forests of Northern Europe in a white German wine. It is the specialty of the town of Arlon, in the south of Belgium.|$|E
50|$|The {{name comes}} from a French term for the tonka bean, coumarou, one of the sources from which {{coumarin}} was first isolated as a natural product in 1820. It has a sweet odor, readily recognised as the scent of newly-mown hay, and {{has been used in}} perfumes since 1882. <b>Sweet</b> <b>woodruff,</b> meadowsweet, sweet grass and sweet-clover in particular are named for their sweet (i.e., pleasant) smell, which in turn is related to their high coumarin content. When it occurs in high concentrations in forage plants, coumarin is a somewhat bitter-tasting appetite suppressant, and is presumed to be produced by plants as a defense chemical to discourage predation.|$|E
5000|$|Coumarin {{is often}} found in {{artificial}} vanilla substitutes, despite having been banned as a food additive in numerous countries since the mid-20th century. Coumarin was banned as a food additive in the United States in 1954, {{largely because of the}} hepatotoxicity results in rodents. Coumarin is currently listed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States among [...] "Substances Generally Prohibited From Direct Addition or Use as Human Food", according to 21 CFR 189.130, but some natural additives containing coumarin, such as the flavorant <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff</b> are allowed [...] "in alcoholic beverages only" [...] (21 CFR 172.510). In Europe, popular examples of such beverages are Maiwein (white wine with woodruff) and Żubrówka (vodka flavoured with bison grass).|$|E
50|$|There {{are fine}} {{examples}} close to Lambley {{and to the}} south of Southwell both in Nottinghamshire where the clay bedrock plateau made up of Mercia Mudstone is dissected by a number of streams, forming steep sided, wooded valleys. This gives a pleasing undulating landscape, locally known as 'The Dumbles'. These areas provide a habitat for Bluebell, yellow archangel, ramsons, dog’s mercury and <b>sweet</b> <b>woodruff.</b> To the southwest of Southwell there are two dumbles, Halloughton Dumble and Westhorpe Dumble, streams sufficiently large to be labelled Dumble on the 50,000:1 and 25,000:1 Ordnance Survey maps. On a smaller scale, some areas are known locally as 'The Dumbles', for example; west of Kirkby-in-Ashfield, in Nottinghamshire, at the end of Doles Lane is a small, wooded, deep cut stream valley with banks adorned with Bluebells.|$|E
