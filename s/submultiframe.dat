50|$|At the {{receiving}} end, the CRC of each <b>submultiframe</b> is calculated locally and {{compared to the}} CRC value received in the next <b>submultiframe.</b> If these do not coincide, one or more bit errors is determined to {{have been found in}} the block, and an alarm is sent back to the transmitter, indicating that the block received at the far end contains errors.|$|E
5000|$|The CRC-4 {{multiframe}} alignment word {{only takes}} up {{six of the}} first eight bits of the TS0 without FAS. There are two bits in every second block or <b>submultiframe,</b> whose task is to indicate block errors in {{the far end of}} the communication. The mechanismis as follows: Both bits (called E-bits) have [...] "1" [...] as their default value. When {{the far end of the}} communication receives a 2 Mbit/s frame and detects an erroneous block, it puts a [...] "0" [...] in the E-bit that corresponds to the block in the frame being sent along the return path to the transmitter. This way, the near end of the communication is informed that an erroneous block has been detected, and both ends have the same information: one from the CRC-4 procedure and the other from the E bits. If we number the frames in the multiframe from 0 to 15, the E-bit of frame 13 refers to the <b>submultiframe</b> I (block I) received at the far end, and the E-bit of frame 15 refers to the <b>submultiframe</b> II (block II).|$|E
50|$|In the TS0 of frames with FAS, {{the first}} bit is {{dedicated}} to carrying the cyclic redundancy checksum (CRC). It tells us whether there are one or more bit errors in a specific group of data received in the previous block of eight frames known as <b>submultiframe.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The aim of {{this system}} is to avoid loss of {{synchronization}} due to the coincidental appearance of the sequence [...] "0011011" [...] in a time slot other than the TS0 of a frame with FAS. To implement the CRC code in the transmission of 2 Mbit/s frames, a CRC-4 multiframe is built, made up of 16 frames. These are then grouped in two blocks of eight frames called submultiframes, over which a CRC checksum or word of four bits (CRC-4) is put in the positions Ci (bits #1, frames with FAS) of the next <b>submultiframe.</b>|$|E
