500|$|Cagney's {{portrayal}} of Cody Jarrett in the 1949 film White Heat {{is one of}} his most memorable. Cinema had changed in the 10 years since Walsh last directed Cagney (in The Strawberry Blonde), and the actor's {{portrayal of}} gangsters had also changed. Unlike Tom Powers in The Public Enemy, Jarrett was portrayed as a raging lunatic with few if any sympathetic qualities. In the 18 intervening years, Cagney's hair had begun to gray, and he developed a paunch for the first time. He was no longer a romantic commodity, and this was reflected in his performance. Cagney himself had the idea of playing Jarrett as psychotic; he later stated, [...] "it was essentially a cheapie one-two-three-four kind of thing, so I suggested we make him nuts. It was agreed <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> in all those fits and headaches." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Footprints in the Sand" [...] {{was written}} by Simon Cowell, David Kreuger, Per Magnusson and Richard Page, whilst the {{production}} was helmed by Steve Mac. It was recorded in 2007 at Rokstone Studios in London, England. Cowell originally {{came up with the}} idea to base a song around the Christian poem [...] "Footprints", and suggested it to Kreuger and Magnusson. They had a scheduled session in Page's home in Malibu, California and finished the song the next day. Cowell secured a songwriting credit for coming up with the idea. In an interview with HitQuarters, Magnusson said they had thought the song would be a good idea for Irish boy band Westlife, but it was offered to British singer Leona Lewis instead. When Cowell mentioned the song concept to Lewis, she agreed that it could be [...] "really quite interesting". Regarding the song, Lewis commented: [...] "Originally it was a poem; it's very inspirational <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> it into a song. I think it is very moving, with a very emotional lyric and I really love to sing this song"; and added that the poem [...] " [...] about standing by someone and being there for people who need your help." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beach Boys {{recorded}} {{using what}} was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked {{many of the}} technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such {{as a replacement for}} what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how [...] "Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and {{that was part of the}} vocals on one of those songs." [...] Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in [...] "With Me Tonight", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice saying [...] "good", as in [...] "good take", spoken by the band's road manager Arnie Geller from the control room. Lockert has spoken about other peculiarities of the sessions, including vocals being tracked in the shower. Due to this eclectic mix of recording paraphernalia and idiosyncratic methods of tracking the sounds, Smiley Smile possesses an unusual sound.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} Edwin Jarvis {{was announced}} to be {{appearing in the}} series in July 2014. Jarvis, a butler to the Stark family in the original comics, was first adapted in the MCU films as an artificial intelligence named J.A.R.V.I.S., created by Tony Stark. The official tie-in comic [...] explained that a more comic-accurate version of the character did exist in the MCU, with the butler Jarvis serving as a mentor to a young Tony and eventually inspiring his A.I.; the Jarvis seen in Agent Carter is a younger version of this butler, working for Howard Stark before Tony is born. D'Arcy was cast in the role in September 2014. Fazekas, explaining the introduction and development of Jarvis in the series, stated that [...] "some of it {{has come from the}} comics and some of it we've developed ourselves. Some of it is influenced by James D'Arcy himself and his strengths." [...] D'Arcy was initially nervous about portraying Jarvis's comedic side, given his history of [...] "predominantly play psychopaths", and did not study Paul Bettany's performance as J.A.R.V.I.S. when approaching the character. Ottobre-Melton explained, in terms of costume design, that [...] "Jarvis is a tweed suit man. He has a large responsibility handling Howard Stark's affairs, and needs to look polished at all times. He's a well-paid employee who can afford custom-made 3-piece suits, and has a British sensibility, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> him in a finely tailored bold black and grey Herringbone suit." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} on Drake's debut album, Thank Me Later, but after Drake forwent the song, he insisted that Songz include it on Ready. Songz stated in an interview what fan reception to the track mostly had been that he should put a verse in on [...] "Successful", but Songz told BallerStatus, [...] "I was like, 'That's my homie's song.' Then initially, Drake {{came up to me}} with the idea like 'Nah dog. That's your song. I'm not putting it on my album. So it's going to be a waste. So it's {{going to be a big}} record with no one to go retrieve it.' <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> the verse on there just to give me a little more presence on the record for it to be on my album." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Drake explained how the song came about, stating, [...] "It has this pocket, and there was no melody yet. I remember [...] kind of making the joint, and then he hit this sound, which is the chords that are in there. It was so eerie. Like it was haunting, almost. I was like, 'Yo, that's it. You need to use that.' He started playing this patch, and just every note that he played fell into place. I had this beat sitting here that I love so much, and I didn't know what to do with it..." ...|$|E
500|$|The New 52 ongoing {{series are}} {{organized}} under seven different [...] "families," [...] grouping similar characters or themes within the books together. By {{the release of}} the October 2013 solicitations, DC was no longer grouping the titles by these families. They instead began releasing one larger solicit, titled [...] "The New 52 Group". However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as [...] "Forever Evil", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. In September 2014, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio spoke about classifying the titles into the families, saying, [...] "one of the things we did, when we launched the New 52, we broke those classifications up {{in a way that we}} were able to draw attention to all the characters. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> them in groupings so we would be able to promote and help them draw attention in groups. It was never made to be a certain amount different stuff. We always want to have different styles of product... with a lot of characters, we're careful. Things like Frankenstein and Grifter and Voodoo and things of that nature, which were really risky characters and risky chances for us to take, and we're very happy to do them. Even though they didn't work, we knew there was value in those characters... We think they brought a lot of value to the launch. They brought a lot of breadth and depth to the line of books, and a diversity to the line. We didn't want to put them out and then forget about them.

2500|$|Lewis {{recorded}} the album in several locations the first being London, England, {{where she worked}} with Steve Mac, who produced the songs [...] "Homeless" [...] and [...] "Footprints in the Sand". [...] "Homeless" [...] was written by Jörgen Elofsson, and was previously recorded by Swedish singer Darin. [...] "Footprints in the Sand" [...] was written by Per Magnusson, David Kreuger, Richard Page and Simon Cowell. The song is an adaptation of the Christian poem [...] "Footprints", and Lewis commented [...] "Originally it was a poem; it's very inspirational <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> it into a song.

[...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV noted that [...] "for {{the first time in a}} while, she seemed comfortable being the pop megastar that she is."

2500|$|... "When Mr. Einstein became {{general manager}} of WHFS, the station {{had been on the}} air for six years and was lucky to draw 800 {{listeners}} a night with its format of pop, light classical and jazz. 'Then a guy named Frank Richards came in one day wearing cutoffs and a leather vest, played me a tape of rock music from Los Angeles,' Mr. Einstein told The Washington Post in 1983. 'We were losing so much money that another couple of dollars couldn't hurt, right? <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> him on. My God, the calls! I never knew we had an audience!' In 1969, three would-be DJs - Joshua Brooks, Sara Vass and Mark Gorbulew - approached Mr. Einstein with an idea for a free-form rock-and-roll program. They went on under the name Spiritus Cheese (derived from a cheese company in New York), and a new era was born. 'It was Jake's vision that FM radio and rock-and-roll were about to collide,' said Mr. Einstein's daughter Rose, who briefly worked at WHFS. 'He saw it as an all-night format that would sustain a station.' Within months, WHFS was drawing an average nightly audience of 32,700 listeners. Spiritus Cheese lasted just a year - someone complained about a four-letter word in a Firesign Theatre skit broadcast on the air - but by then the station had found its niche." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Black Keys began {{recording}} Turn Blue in January 2013 at Key Club in Benton Harbor, Michigan, {{during a}} break from their El Camino Tour. The studio had a rare Flickinger recording console custom built for Sly Stone that the band liked, and the location had been recommended by fellow rock band the Kills. For Turn Blue, {{just as they did}} for El Camino, the Black Keys entered the studio without having written any songs. Auerbach said, [...] "Every morning we got to the studio, we'd start from scratch {{and by the end of}} the day we'd have a new song and that was really it." [...] The group spent 12 days at Key Club, sleeping above the studio and not once leaving the building. During these sessions, [...] "Gotta Get Away", [...] "It's Up to You Now", and the first half of [...] "Fever" [...] were recorded. Carney said that while in Michigan, the group was still trying to write hooky songs like they did for El Camino: [...] "we were still on that singles thing. I wanted [...] to let the record just breathe, and I think [...] wanted the songs to move along... There were some moments that got a little tense." [...] Carney added, [...] "We were kind of playing it safe. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> the sessions on hold." ...|$|E
2500|$|When the two steamers {{began their}} journey {{down the coast}} again, it wasn't long before they found three of the prahus. The water was shallow that the Rainbow had the Jolly Bachelor in tow and her captain, the rajah mudah, {{intended}} to release the other ship {{as soon as they}} were in a good firing position. Brooke then asked his Sarawakian followers if the three vessels in front of him were that of pirates, to be sure, and they said yes, so as soon as the Sulus realised they were under attack they began killing the captives while fleeing to dangerous waters. Father McDougall later wrote the following; [...] "So we took to our stations, loaded our guns, and prepared for action. The leading boat had already gained on the other two and was going nearly as fast as the steamer herself. I never saw fellows pull <b>so.</b> <b>We</b> <b>put</b> on all steam, cast off the Jolly, and tried to get in between her and the point, but she beat us, and passed inside of us into shallow water, where we could not follow. Then she opened her fire upon us, which we returned with interest. She, like the others, had no heavy guns, but they all carried three long brass swivels, called lelahs, and plenty of rifles and muskets." [...] The bishop went on to say that one of the captured pirates revealed to him that each of their swivels took seven men to lift and there was forty rifles and muskets aboard each boat, or more.|$|E
