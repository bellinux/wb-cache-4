5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Heroes of Mana features a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures and enemies. Unlike prior {{games in the}} series, which are typically action role-playing games, Heroes is a real-time strategy game (RTS), in which the player controls up to 25 units in battles on fixed maps. Units are controlled via the Nintendo DS touch screen, selected by tapping on them and sent to destinations or to attack by tapping on their target. The game world is divided into an isometric grid, with one unit allowed per space. The Nintendo DS's <b>second</b> <b>screen</b> shows {{a map of the}} current mission, including which parts of the map can currently be seen by the player's units and which parts are covered by fog of war.

5|$|The ride {{begins with}} Evac {{moving out of}} the loading station and making a turn. The vehicle {{approaches}} the first of thirteen 3D high-definition video screens which depicts Ravage grabbing a canister containing the AllSpark. Evac spins 180° to face the <b>second</b> <b>screen</b> on which Bumblebee is fighting Sideways for the AllSpark, which ends up in Evac's possession. Evac reverses into one of two elevator shafts which ascend to the second level of the attraction. During the ascent Optimus Prime battles Megatron and Grindor chases Evac who is furiously heading in reverse until Grindor's arm is broken off by a train. Megatron grabs Evac and the two struggle until Megatron breaks a water pipe, which sprays riders with water. Evac enters a dead end pathway before reversing and turning to face another 3D screen, which shows Megatron firing a missile at Evac while continuing to find Optimus. Hot air and fog generate the illusion of an explosion. Evac then heads through the hole in a building which was caused by the explosion. Inside lies Devastator, who is trying to suck everything out of the building. Ratchet and Ironhide cover fire while Evac reverses and escapes the suction. Here the Autobot Sideswipe helps in the battle against the Decepticon Bonecrusher. Devastator returns to the scene alongside Starscream. Evac escapes from Devastator a second time by going through him, but Starscream grabs Evac and throws him across several city blocks before landing on a construction site and smashing into some drums which release clouds of fog resulting in Evac asking if the riders are okay. Optimus Prime and Megatron continue their battle in the construction site as Evac reverses away in an attempt to protect the AllSpark. Starscream appears for a second time but is chased away by two NEST helicopters. Evac then returns to a second set of two elevators. During the descent to the ground floor, Evac forces the AllSpark into Megatron's chest causing both to freefall to the ground when Megatron grabs Evac. Bumblebee saves Evac from destruction before Optimus Prime congratulates Evac and the riders on their mission. The last thing guests see before disembarking is the twisted wreckage of Megatron stuck in the ceiling near the exit.|$|E

40|$|Background. This study {{analyzed}} {{the relationship between}} past screening behavior, determinants, inten-tion, and future screening participation in the Dutch national breast cancer screening program. Methods. Participation at the first and <b>second</b> <b>screening</b> rounds was monitored. Furthermore, be-tween {{the first and the}} <b>second</b> <b>screening</b> rounds, women received a questionnaire (response 58 %, n = 395). The questionnaire was based on the ASE model, including attitude (consequences, anticipated regret, and moral obligation), social influence (support and modeling), and self-efficacy. Other distal variables as-sessed were previous screening behavior, evaluation of screening characteristics, and demographics. Results. Participants at the <b>second</b> <b>screening</b> dif-fered from nonparticipants on all ASE determinants. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that for previous participants and nonparticipants different ASE determinants and distal variables explained the variance in intention to participate in the next screen-ing (30 to 45 %). Logistic regression analyses showed that past behavior and intention (which mediated the effects of the ASE variables) were significant predic-tors of participation in the <b>second</b> <b>screening.</b> Conclusions. Differences between previous partici-pants and nonparticipants in determinants of inten-tion and future screening behavior can be used to im-prove participation and adherence to breast cancer screening. © 1997 Academic Press Key Words: breast cancer screening; attitude; antic...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims Prior studies {{assessing}} the yield of a <b>second</b> <b>screening</b> colonoscopy performed 10 years {{after an initial}} negative screening colonoscopy {{did not include a}} control group of persons undergoing their first screening colonoscopy during the same time interval. Our aim was to describe the incidence of neoplasia at a <b>second</b> <b>screening</b> colonoscopy (performed at least 8 years after the first colonoscopy) in average risk individuals and compare it with the yield of first screening examinations performed during the same time interval. Methods Review of a database of outpatient screening colonoscopies performed between January 2010 and December 2015 in an Atlanta private practice. Results A total of 2105 average risk individuals underwent screening colonoscopy, including 470 individuals (53. 6 % female; mean age 64. 0 ± 3. 9 years) who underwent a <b>second</b> <b>screening</b> examination. In those undergoing <b>second</b> <b>screening,</b> the mean interval between examinations was 10. 4 years (± 1. 1; range 8 - 15 years). At <b>second</b> <b>screening,</b> the polyp detection rate (PDR), adenoma detection rate (ADR) and advanced neoplasm rate (ANR) were 44. 7 %, 26. 6 %, and 7. 4 %, respectively. Of 40 advanced neoplasms in 35 individuals, 33 (82. 5 %) were proximal to the sigmoid colon, and there were no cancers. During the same interval, 1635 individuals (49. 4 % female; mean age 52. 6 ± 3. 4 years) underwent their first screening colonoscopy. The PDR, ADR and ANR were 53. 5 %, 32. 2 %, and 11. 7 %, respectively. Of 243 advanced neoplasms in 192 individuals, 152 (62. 6 %) were proximal to the sigmoid colon, and there were no cancers. After adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, and endoscopist, PDR, ADR, and ANR were all lower at the <b>second</b> <b>screening</b> colonoscopies than at first-time colonoscopies (all p< 0. 001). Conclusions Despite being 10 years older, persons with a negative screening colonoscopy 10 years earlier had numerically lower rates of adenomas and advanced neoplasms at their <b>second</b> <b>screening</b> examination compared with patients in the same practice undergoing their first screening colonoscopy, and they had no cancers. The fraction of advanced neoplasms that were proximal to the sigmoid was high in both first and second screenings. These results support the safety of the recommended 10 -year interval between colonoscopies in average risk persons with an initial negative examination...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{evaluated}} whether biennial screening {{with prostate}} specific antigen (PSA) only {{is sufficient to}} detect prostate cancer while still curable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In Goteborg, Sweden 9, 972 men 50 to 65 years old were randomized to PSA screening. During 1995 and 1996 these men were invited for a first PSA screening and invited during 1997 and 1998 for a <b>second</b> <b>screening.</b> The screening procedure included PSA measurement in all men and in those with a PSA of 3 ng. /ml. or greater also it included digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound and sextant biopsies. RESULTS: In the first screening 5, 854 men participated and 145 cancers were detected. In the <b>second</b> <b>screening</b> 5, 267 men participated and 111 cancers were detected. Only 9 interval cancers were diagnosed. In the <b>second</b> <b>screening</b> 102 cancers (92 %) were associated with PSA less than 10 ng. /ml. Of 465 men with increased PSA and who underwent biopsy with a benign outcome in the first screening 50 had cancer at the <b>second</b> <b>screening.</b> Of 241 men in whom PSA increased between screenings 1 and 2 cancer was detected in 46. None of the 2, 950 men with an initial PSA of less than 1 ng. /ml. had a PSA of greater than 3 ng. /ml. or interval cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In men with a PSA of less than 2 ng. /ml. it seems safe to offer repeat screening after 2 years with PSA only. Men with a PSA of 2 to 3 ng. /ml. or a value of greater than 3 ng. /ml. with negative biopsy may {{be better served by}} a shorter screening interval.

PARTICIPANTS 5388 men (mean age 48 years) at first screening and 2595 men at <b>second</b> <b>screening</b> who had complete data on all measures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Hazard ratios for all cause mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease (ICD 9 390 - 459), coronary heart disease (ICD 9 410 - 414), smoking related cancers (ICD 9 140, 141, 143 - 9, 150, 157, 160 - 163, 188 and 189), other cancers (ICD 9 140 - 208 other than smoking related), stroke (ICD 9 430 - 438), respiratory diseases (ICD 9 460 - 519) and alcohol related causes (ICD 9 141, 143 - 6, 148 - 9, 150, 155, 161, 291, 303, 571 and 800 - 998).
