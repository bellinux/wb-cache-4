40|$|The {{reliance}} on tourism {{as an economic}} generator has become increasingly important in island communities following a decline in traditional industries. The flow of visitors to these areas impacts upon a variety of sectors and service provisions, adds to job creation, and evokes vibrancy in areas with low and dispersed populations. The mercurial and interdependent nature of tourism is both supported and challenged by the input of numerous stakeholders with a heavy private sector advocacy. In comparison, whilst some entrepreneurial transport provision is evident, geographical distance and low population density contributes to subsidisation and public sector governance of transport systems to curb <b>service</b> <b>irregularity</b> and ensure infrastructure investment. This article investigates the feasibility of cross-sectoral interaction between transport and tourism stakeholders and their perceptions and experiences of working together to manage destinations. Exploratory research involving in-depth interviews with multiple stakeholders identified a growing awareness of the benefits and necessity of collaboration between sectors to increase the attractiveness, accessibility and in turn sustainability of island destinations. Analysis suggests that {{the extent to which}} joint working occurs is dependent upon collaborative capacity; leadership; and the cohesion, strength and scope of local governance...|$|E
40|$|Summary   The growing {{congestion}} problems {{in big cities}} result in growing need for public transport services. In order to attract new users, public transport operators are looking for methods to improve  their performance  and level of service.    Service reliability  is {{one of the main}}   objectives   of  public  transport   operators.    Various   sources   of  service   uncertainty   can   causebus  bunching:  buses  from  the same  line tend  to bunch  together  due to a positive feedback  loop,  unless  control  measures   are  implemented.    The  most  commonly   used strategy for preventing <b>service</b> <b>irregularity</b> is  to define holding points along the bus route. The design of the holding strategy involves the determination  of the optimal number and location of holding points, as well as the holding criteria. These strategies are classified to schedule-  or  headway-based.    Previous  studies  showed  that  headway-based   strategies have the potential  to improve  transit  performance  from both passengers  and operators perspectives.   This thesis analyzes the performance of optimization algorithms when solving the holding problem. The optimization process involves the determination  of time point location for a given  headway-based   strategy.    The  evaluation   of  candidate   solutions   is  based  on  a mesoscopic  transit simulation.  The input data for the simulation  corresponds  to the bus line number 1 in Stockholm city.   The  objective  function  is  made  up  of  the  weighted  sum  of  all  time  components  that passengers  experience:  in-vehicle  riding  time,  dwell  time,  waiting  time  at stop  and  on- board holding time. The optimization was carried out by greedy and genetic algorithms.  In addition, a multi-objective  function that incorporated  the performance  from the operator perspective was solved using a multi-objective genetic algorithm.   The results demonstrate  the potential benefits from optimizing the location of time point stops.  The  best  solution  results  in  an  improvement   of  around   11 %  in  the  objective function value. Interestingly, the results indicate that wrongly chosen time point stops can yield transit performance that is worse off than having no holding control. ...|$|E

5000|$|On 19 November 2012, RTL Télé Lëtzebuerg aired a story {{alleging that}} {{the former head of}} the State Intelligence Service (SREL), Marco Mille, had used a {{wristwatch}} to covertly record a confidential conversation with Juncker in 2008. According to the report, although Juncker had later found out about the recording, he took no action against Mille and allowed him to leave the service in 2010 for a position with Siemens. A transcript of the conversation was published by D'Lëtzebuerger Land, which highlighted the disorganised state of the secret service, mentioned links between Grand Duke Henri and MI6 and referred to the [...] "Bommeleeër" [...] scandal. On 4 December 2012, the Chamber of Deputies voted to set up a Parliamentary Inquiry into allegations of SREL misconduct including the illegal bugging of politicians, purchase of cars for private use and allegations of taking payments and favours in exchange for access to officials. The inquiry heard from witnesses who claimed that SREL had conducted six or seven illegal wiretapping operations between 2007 and 2009, as well as covert operations in Iraq, Cuba and Libya. The report concluded that Juncker had to bear political responsibility for SREL's activities, that he had been deficient in his control over the service and that he had failed to report all of the <b>service's</b> <b>irregularities</b> to the enquiry commission. Juncker himself denied wrongdoing.|$|R
40|$|In {{the area}} of {{constitutional}} law in Greece, where at least since 1975 {{there has been a}} well functioning democracy, the ideal of 'modernisation' must mean adherence to the substantive principles of legality {{and the rule of law}} as political ideals. Even though the Simitis government showed some concern for improvement in these areas, the constitutional amendment of 2001 did not attempt to tackle longstanding problems such as civil <b>service</b> corruption, <b>irregularities</b> in public procurement, the independence of the judiciary and the like. The amendment was motivated, it seems, by a more majoritarian 'communitarian' legal philosophy seeking to strengthen political majorities. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{trend of}} concentrating to core {{competencies}} leads to outsourcing of non-core activities. One such activity is logistics, where the responsibility {{is given to}} third-party service providers. This means the service provider acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the end customer. This thesis concentrates on depicting the operational environment of one such service provider, Swissport Finland Ltd, and the improvement of their checked baggage <b>irregularity</b> <b>service.</b> The tools used for this work were service blueprinting, an illustrative method for service mapping, and failure modes and effects analysis. The theoretical part of the thesis offers a framework for using these tools for logistics services, while the empirical part consists of a study mostly qualitative in nature. Action research method {{was used for the}} service improvement research. According to {{the results of this study}} the combination of service blueprinting and FMEA can be used successfully for <b>irregularity</b> <b>service</b> improvement. The most important result was an enhanced irregularity process that has been found to alleviate earlier problems...|$|R
