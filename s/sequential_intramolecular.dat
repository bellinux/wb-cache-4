40|$|Structures {{have been}} {{determined}} for bilirubin-IXα conjugates in freshly collected bile of normal rats, dogs and man and in post-obstructive bile {{of man and}} rats. The originally secreted conjugate has been characterized as azopigment (I), i. e. a 1 -O-acyl-β-d-glucopyranuronic acid glycoside. Conversion of the acetylated methyl ester of azopigment (I) into methyl 2, 3, 4 -tri-O-acetyl- 1 -bromo- 1 -deoxy-β-d-glucopyranuronate (V) indicates the pyranose ring structure for the carbohydrate and a C- 1 attachment for the bilirubin-IXα acyl group. Alternative procedures for deconjugation of azopigment (I) and its derivatives are also described. In post-obstructive bile, the 1 -O-acylglucuronide is converted into 2 -, 3 - and 4 -O-acylglucuronides via <b>sequential</b> <b>intramolecular</b> migrations of the bilirubin acyl group. The following approach was utilized. (1) The tetrapyrrole conjugates were cleaved to dipyrrolic aniline and ethyl anthranilate azopigments, and the azopigments were separated as the acids or methyl esters. (2) The isomeric methyl esters were characterized by mass spectral analysis of the acetates and silyl ethers. (3) The free glycosidic function was demonstrated by 1 -oxime and 1 -methoxime derivative formation. (4) The position of the dipyrrolic O-acyl group was determined for the methyl esters by protecting the free hydroxyl groups of the glucuronic acid moieties as the acetals formed with ethyl vinyl ether and by further conversion of the carbohydrates into partially methylated alditol acetates.

40|$|In {{little more}} than twenty-five years, samarium(II) iodide (SmI 2) has become a {{benchmark}} reducing agent in organic chemistry. This powerful reductant possesses adjustable reactivity {{and continues to be}} a useful reagent in a wide array of organic reactions. SmI 2 is a one-electron reducing agent that promotes both radical and anionic processes. Three fundamental transformations can be achieved using SmI 2 : functional group reduction, reductive coupling of halides with π-bonds, and reductive couplings of two π-bonds. The focus of this work elaborates on the latter two processes. ^ I. Ketyl-allene cyclizations promoted by samarium(II) iodide. Carbon radicals are reliable and efficient intermediates for the construction of carbon-carbon bonds. Samarium(II) iodide has proven to be an effective reagent for intramolecular reductive coupling reactions. Earlier investigations of intramolecular ketyl-olefin coupling reactions provided carbocycles in excellent yield and good diastereoselectivity. This method has been extended to ketyl cyclizations with allenes. Allenyl substrates, which lead to both carbocycles and heterocycles in a selective manner are explored. * ^ II. Nucleophilic acyl transfer/cyclization for the formation of lactams. It has previously been observed that a phenyl ketone containing a carbamate moiety underwent a SmI 2 -promoted nucleophilic acyl transfer reaction for the formation of γ-lactams. In contrast to the typical acyl substitution reaction, the carbonyl, rather than an alkyl halide, reacts with another acyl group. Additionally, the acyl group transfer occurs with a carbamate, which is uncommon. This novel SmI 2 -mediated nucleophilic acyl transfer/substitution is further explored. *^ III. <b>Sequential</b> <b>intramolecular</b> Barbier/Grob fragmentation: An anionic process. The Molander group has utilized SmI 2 for entry to medium-sized carbocycles via sequential reactions. Efforts were directed toward a two-electron process, wherein an appropriately designed substrate would undergo an intramolecular Barbier reaction to afford a fused bicyclic alkoxide. With proper orbital alignment, the intermediate alkoxide is poised to undergo a Grob fragmentation to furnish both medium- and large-membered rings. Using epoxides or aziridines as leaving groups, the Grob fragmentation provides a handle for further elaboration. *^ *Please refer to dissertation for diagrams. ...|$|E

Z- 4, 5 -Diethynyl- 4 -octene (4) undergoes rearrangement to yield 2, 3 -di-n-propyl- 1, 4 -dehydrobenzene (17). Solution pyrolysis of 4 in inert aromatic solvents produces three unimolecular products, Z-dodeca- 4, 8 -diyn- 6 -ene (7), benzocyclooctene (9) and o-allyl-n-propylbenzene (10) in high yield. When 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene {{is added to the}} pyrolysis solution as a trapping agent, high yields of the reduced product o-di-n-propylbenzene (12) are obtained. The kinetics of solution pyrolysis of 4 in the presence and absence of trapping agent establish that 2, 3 -di-n-propyl- 1, 4 -dehydrobenzene is a discrete intermediate on the pathway leading to products. When the reaction was run in the heated probe of an NMR spectrometer, CIDNP was observed in 10.

The observation of CIDNP, coupled with the reactivity exhibited by 17 and the other two intermediates, implicate a biradical description of these molecules. Biradical 17 has been estimated to have a lifetime of about 10 {sup - 9 } sec at: 200 °C and to lie in a well of kcal/mol with respect to the lowest energy unimolecular pathway ([1, 5] hydrogen transfer). Ring opening (expected to be the lowest energy process for 1, 4 -dehydrobenzenes in which intramolecular hydrogen transfer is unlikely) to the isomeric diethynyl olefin 7 appears to have an activation enthalpy of about 10 kcal/moL Upon thermal reaction in the gas phase (400 °C) or in solution in inert solvents Z-hexa- 2, 3 -diethyl- 1, 5 -~diyn- 3 -ene (5) rearranges in good yield to the isomeric diethynyl olefin Z-deca- 3, 7 -diyn- 5 -ene (8) again presumably via 2, 3 -diethyl- 1, 4 -dehydrobenzene 20 (addition of 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene to the reaction solution leads to a good yield of o-diethylbenzene, the expected trapping product of biradical 20).

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of ChemistrySundeep RayatResearch in our {{laboratory}} {{has focused}} on designing photoactivated DNA cleaving agents based on tetrazolethione scaffolds. The key step in the activation of these involves conversion of tetrazolethione moiety to carbodiimides upon irradiation. However, the mechanism of this reaction was not previously reported. Therefore, we undertook a study to elucidate the mechanism of photodecomposition of tetrazolethione as to identify reactive intermediates involved, that may interfere or aid with the activity of our synthesized DNA cleaving agents under physiological conditions. In Part 1 of this dissertation, we present mechanistic studies on this photodecomposition. Our results indicate the clean photoconversion of tetrazolethiones I to their respective carbodiimides IV via the expulsion of sulfur and dinitrogen. Photoirradiation {{in the presence of}} trapping agent (e. g. 1, 4 -cyclohexadiene) resulted into the formation of their corresponding thioureas. Thus, providing strong evidence for the intermediacy of a 1, 3 -biradical III, which is believed to be in its triplet spin multiplicity. Further investigations (triplet sensitization and quenching experiments) to determine the precursor of the biradical argued against the involvement of a triplet excited state (T[subscript] 1). We believe that the mechanistic pathway that leads to the formation of a 1, 3 -triplet biradical III is a diradicaloid species II-II" generated directly from the singlet excited state of tetrazolethiones (S[subscript] 1) after the expulsion of dinitrogen. Once formed, this diradicaloid species could be envisioned to undergo intersystem crossing to generate the 1, 3 triplet biradical III which then undergoes desulfurization to form carbodiimides IV (Chapter 2). Bridgehead-nitrogen containing fused heterocycles are regarded as “privileged structure” in biology and have found widespread applications in pharmaceutical industry. These heterocycles have also been evaluated in electroluminescent devices and organic dyes. Part II of the dissertation present new, concise and low cost strategies to a unique class of bridgehead nitrogen-containing fused heterocyclic scaffolds which involves two <b>sequential</b> <b>intramolecular</b> cyclizations from heteroenyne-allenes in the presence of Lewis acids such as SnCl[subscript] 4 and BF[subscript] 3.

Furthermore, we employed density functional theory to gain insights into the optoelectronic properties of select derivatives of phenanthridine-fused quinazoliniminiums (PNQs) VII and their free base in order to evaluate their scope in OLED technology. Our results show that the energies of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO), the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, the ionization potentials, electron affinities and the reorganization energies can be finely tuned by varying the substituents on these chromophores. In addition, we found that the introduction of an electron donating group (NMe[subscript] 2) on the PNQs and their free base increases the energies of the HOMOs and decreases the ionization potentials, relative to its unsubstituted derivative, whereas substitution by an electron withdrawing group (NO[subscript] 2) decreases the energies of the LUMOs and increases the electron affinities which in turn suggests an improvement in their hole and electron creating abilities, respectively (Chapter 4) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{exploration}} of C-H activation and Au-catalysis as modern tools for theconstruction of C-C and C-N bonds. In the introductory part of this thesis the origin of the field and few significant examples are discussed. Part I of the thesis deals with Pd- and/or Cu-catalyzed direct functionalization of azoles. Chapter I describes the hitherto unknown direct C-H (het) arylation of substituted 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazole employing awide range of (het) aryl halides and pseudohalides using a Pd/Cu-catalyzed protocol. The utility of the developed methodology is further validated by a one pot C-H arylation - Suzuki-couplingsequence. Chapter 2 demonstrates the generation of novel diazine-azole biheterocyclic frameworks. In this chapter an elegant dehydrative coupling of various azoles with tautomerizable heterocycleshas been shown through PyBrop-mediated and Pd/Cu-catalyzed sequential C-OH/C-H activation. Chapter 3 discusses the discovery and elaboration of the unprecedented direct secondary and tertiary C-H alkylation of azoles via Heteroarene-Amine-Aldehyde (HA 2) or Heteroarene-Amine-Ketone (HAK) coupling. The mild conditions of the developed protocol also facilitate an orthogonal C-H alkylation-C-H arylation sequence for the synthesis of amine-tethered azoles. Part II of the thesis deals with Au-catalyzed heteroannulations for the construction of fusedheterocycles. In Chapter 1 a mild and efficient microwave-assisted synthesis of pyrazino[2, 1 -b]quinazolines and 3 -indolyl- 2 (1 H) -pyrazinones applying a chemoselective Ag-catalyzed 6 -exo-dig andAu-catalyzed 5 -endo-dig cyclization is developed. Chapter 2 represents a diversity-oriented approach for the synthesis of (dihydro) imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyrazin- 8 (7 H) -ones via a cationic Au-catalyzed regioselective 5 -exo-dig heteroannulation. The methodology allows the further installation of diversity via Suzuki-coupling, thereby furnishing a convenient access to polysubstituted imidazopyrazinones. Chapter 3 describes a <b>sequential</b> Ugi/Au-catalyzed <b>intramolecular</b> carbocyclization approach for the construction of indoloazepinones and indoloazocinones. Diversity is introduced via Ugi- 4 CR and the selectivity for endo-dig cyclization is secured by Au-catalyzed intramolecular carbocyclization.
