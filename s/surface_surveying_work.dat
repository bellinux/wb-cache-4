50|$|<b>Survey</b> <b>work</b> {{has many}} {{benefits}} if performed as a preliminary exercise to, {{or even in}} place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, {{because it does not}} require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ sampling methods.) As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It {{is the only way to}} gather some forms of information, such as settlement patterns and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into maps, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution.The simplest <b>survey</b> technique is <b>surface</b> <b>survey.</b> It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the <b>surface.</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>survey</b> cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. <b>Surface</b> <b>survey</b> may also include mini-excavation techniques such as augers, corers, and shovel test pits. If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed sterile.|$|R

40|$|High-resolution, multi-spectral {{satellite}} imagery can be deployed {{in combination with}} ground control, archaeological <b>surface</b> <b>survey,</b> and environmental research to produce a richer understanding of the archaeological landscape. While intensive <b>surface</b> <b>survey</b> remains {{the gold standard for}} site detection, remote sensing allows larger areas to be evaluated quickly and efficiently. During 2007 and 2008, investigators analysed approximately 70 sq km surrounding the site of l'Amastuola, in Apulia, Italy, supplemented in 2009 by another 85 sq km in the environs of the ancient city of Seuthopolis, near Kazanluk, Bulgaria. Previous and concurrent <b>surface</b> <b>survey</b> provided site definitions and a large sample of sites discovered through an independent process. Integration and comparison of remote sensing and <b>surface</b> <b>survey</b> data indicated that although remote sensing dramatically increased the area evaluated in both regions, only certain sites could be detected and patterns of discovery varied by region. In Italy, remote sensing primarily revealed sites associated with geological conditions amenable to past human habitation. In Bulgaria detection depended upon a combination of cultural and environmental factors. Integrating the two methods allows remote sensing to extend the reach of <b>surface</b> <b>survey,</b> while <b>surface</b> <b>survey</b> indicates the detection rates and patterns provided by remote sensing. 8 page(s...|$|R
