5|$|During World WarI, the palace, {{then the}} home of King GeorgeV and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more {{valuable}} contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in situ. The King imposed rationing at the palace, much {{to the dismay of}} his guests and household. To the King's later regret, David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol, to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence. In 1938, the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth was {{regarded}} by her contemporaries as an efficient but ruthless politician who used political intrigues {{to protect and}} defend her daughters' rights. She was a caring parent, but was neither politically talented nor competent to prepare Mary and Hedwig for their roles as monarchs. Elizabeth failed to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> for her daughters, and her unbalanced character and questionable methods in politics would serve more {{as a warning to}} the young sovereigns. Her procrastinations and inability to make clear decisions threatened Hedwig's status, while her endless problems with Croatian nobles and failure to improve relations with her native Bosnia made Mary's reign insecure and tumultuous.|$|E

25|$|These divides {{can also}} occur {{between members of}} the same generation, {{particularly}} between older siblings who may identify more strongly with their home country and younger siblings who may identify more with American culture. This is especially likely to occur when older siblings belong to the 1.5 generation, meaning that they were born abroad, and younger siblings were born in the United States. In many societies, older siblings are given greater responsibilities and may feel more pressure from parents to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> for their younger siblings by performing well in school and obtaining success. At the same time, this greater responsibility often affords older siblings a greater degree of power within the family. Older siblings may therefore also be more likely to uphold their parents' traditional values because of the power it affords them within the family. In America's more egalitarian culture, power hierarchies based on age {{are less likely to be}} accepted. Younger siblings may therefore reject the authority of their older siblings, fostering tensions within the family. The migration process can therefore destabilize traditional power hierarchies within the family based on age and in some cases may lead to a reversal of such hierarchies. Regardless of whether tension exists among members of different generations or {{members of the same}} generation, degree of assimilation may pave the way for divisions within the family.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Liverpool Daily Post editor Larry Neild was {{selected}} to join Liverpool's 'Health is Wealth' commission, researching [...] the effects of food deprivation on poor health, after writing a scathing column in which he suggested that the commission’s chairman, Sue Woodward, chief executive of ITV Granada, should <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> in Coronation Street by banning Betty’s hotpot. In October of the same year, allegedly the world’s biggest Lancashire hotpot was created, based on Betty’s traditional hotpot recipe from Coronation Street. The hotpot was cooked in a specially crafted 12ft by 7ft tin, weighing 200 kilos. 2008 saw Betty's hotpot come under scrutiny in the soap, after Street resident Jerry Morton suffered a heart attack. Jerry's ex-wife Teresa Bryant blamed the fatty meat in Betty's hotpots for hardening his arteries, and local butcher Ashley Peacock suggested that ostrich meat may be an up-and-coming new alternative, much to Betty's outrage. Despite her character's culinary skill, Driver claims she [...] "couldn't cook a hotpot to save [...] life".|$|E
500|$|In 1972, a Swedish court fined McCartney £1,000 for {{cannabis}} possession. Soon after, Scottish {{police found}} marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to his 1973 conviction for illegal cultivation and a £100 fine. As {{a result of}} his drug convictions, the US government repeatedly denied him a visa until December 1973. Arrested again for marijuana possession in 1975, in Los Angeles, Linda took the blame, and the court soon dismissed the charges. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan, customs officials found approximately 8ounces (200g) of cannabis in his luggage. They arrested McCartney and brought him to a local jail while the Japanese government decided what to do. After ten days, they released and deported him without charge. In 1984, while McCartney was on holiday in Barbados, authorities arrested him for possession of marijuana and fined him $200. Upon his return to England, he stated: [...] "cannabis is... less harmful than rum punch, whiskey, nicotine and glue, all of which are perfectly legal... I don't think... I was doing anyone any harm whatsoever." [...] In 1997, he spoke out in support of decriminalisation of the drug: [...] "People are smoking pot anyway and to make them criminals is wrong." [...] He did however, decide to quit cannabis in 2015, citing a desire to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> for his grandchildren.|$|E
500|$|This factor {{also worked}} in reverse; while Hannah de Rothschild was keen to marry Rosebery, {{she was also}} aware of many obstacles, the {{foremost}} being that she was devoted to her faith, and to leave {{it would be a}} severe moral wrench. Another obstacle was the Rothschild family itself: it was their custom to marry cousins to keep their fortune within the family. Ironically, Hannah herself had opposed the marriage of her cousin Annie de Rothschild to the Christian Eliot Yorke, the son of the Earl of Hardwicke, in 1866. In fact, she was to be the third daughter of the family's English branch to marry outside of the Jewish faith, but such was the fame of the bridegroom and the resultant publicity that the Jewish elders and press felt an example needed to be made. The Jewish Chronicle announced its [...] "most poignant grief" [...] at the prospect, and cryptically added, [...] "If the flame seize on the cedars, how will fare the hyssop on the wall: if the leviathan is brought up with a hook, how will the minnows escape," [...] demonstrating what a threat to the social fabric of the Jewish faith the Jewish elders saw in the prospect of such a marriage. The quotation, originally from the Babylonian Talmud, can be taken to mean that the elders and respected members and more notable members of the Jewish faith should <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> by strictly following the teachings of the Jewish articles of faith which frown upon marriage to members of other religions.|$|E

2500|$|Similar {{in style}} and content to the 1940s serials, Batman and Robin would arrive {{at the bottom of}} the Batpoles in the Batcave in full costume (reference is made later in the series to some sort of costuming device that {{functions}} on the way down the poles).
