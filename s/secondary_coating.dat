The water stability of warm mixing regeneration mixture was studied systematically with Evotherm warm mixing agent and self-prepared interface dispersant, the form change of old asphalt membrane and old aggregate in RAP was analyzed based on interface effect, and the optimum interface dispersant dosage was determined on this base. Results showed that: with the the interface dispersant dosage rising, significant {{changes of the}} TSR and splitting strength frozen-thawed before and after of warm mixing regeneration mixture occurred; when the interface dispersant dosage reached 2 ‰(based on RAP), both the TSR and splitting strength frozen-thawed before and after of warm mixing regeneration mixture were high,which verified the excellent water stability of warm mixing regeneration mixture; superfluous interface dispersant had negative effects on the water stability of warm mixing regeneration mixture.

40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{delamination}} of polymeric coatings from glass fibers, temperature cycling induced interfacial-shear-stress between the glass fiber and primary coating should be always smaller than its interfacial shear strength {{in a long}} time. The method {{for the prevention of}} the long-term delamination of polymeric coatings from glass fibers is as follows. The thickness of the primary coating can be increased if the spring constant of the optical fiber is selected to prevent low temperature microbending of the glass fiber. Meanwhile, Poisson's ratio of the primary coating should be selected to be very close to 0. 5. Alternatively, the relaxation time of the primary coating and <b>secondary</b> <b>coating</b> should be increased, but Young's modulus of the primary coating as well as the thermal expansion coefficient of the <b>secondary</b> <b>coating</b> should be decreased. Meanwhile, the thickness and Young's modulus of the <b>secondary</b> <b>coating</b> should be decreased if the strength of the <b>secondary</b> <b>coating</b> is satisfied. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This work develops a simple test method {{to evaluate the}} performance of agglomeration-resistant coating for granulated Buton asphalt, consisting of water-based polymeric primary coating and mineral-based <b>secondary</b> <b>coating.</b> The method uses a static load cell to measure the agglomerated granule count fraction under simulated storage conditions. A 24 - 1 fractional factorial experiment with two replications is employed to evaluate the effect of coating drying temperature, drying time, asphalt to <b>secondary</b> <b>coating</b> mass ratio, and <b>secondary</b> <b>coating</b> type on the agglomerated count fraction at ambient temperature and 60 oC. The test is able to measure a statistically significant increase in agglomeration resistance when the coating is applied, with an agglomerated fraction of 17. 5 % at 60 oC. The test identifies asphalt to <b>secondary</b> <b>coating</b> weight ratio as a significant factor, with an ANOVA p-value much lower than other effects.

40|$|Alginate {{microspheres}} show {{promise for}} cell-encapsulation therapy but encounter challenges related to biocompatibility. In the present work we designed novel microbeads and microcapsules based on sulfated polyalternating MG alginate (SMG) and explored their inflammatory properties using a {{human whole blood}} model. SMG was either incorporated within the alginate microbeads or used as a <b>secondary</b> <b>coat</b> on poly-l-lysine (PLL) -containing microcapsules, resulting in reduction of the inflammatory cytokines (IL- 1 β, TNF, IL- 6, IL- 8, MIP- 1 α). The sulfated alginate microbeads exhibited a complement inert nature with no induction of terminal complement complex (TCC) above the values in freshly drawn blood and low surface accumulation of C 3 /C 3 b/iC 3 b. Conversely, SMG as a coating material lead to substantial TCC amounts and surface C 3 /C 3 b/iC 3 b. A common thread was an increased association of the complement inhibitor factor H to the alginate microbeads and microcapsules containing sulfated alginates. Factor H was also found to associate to non-sulfated alginate microbeads in lower amounts, indicating factor H binding as an inherent property of alginate. We conclude that the dampening effect on the cytokine response and increased factor H association points to sulfated alginate as a promising strategy for improving the biocompatibility of alginate microspheres. © 2016.

40|$|The {{viscoelastic}} {{behavior of}} commercial UV-cured polymeric coatings of optical fibers is evaluated using dynamic mechanic analysis. The {{results indicate that}} relaxation of stresses and/or strains in these coatings occurs by creep deformation. The axial strain-induced viscoelastic stresses in optical fibers are derived from the exact viscoelastic behavior of the polymeric coatings. Compressive radial stress on the glass fiber produces microbending losses, and therefore, microbending losses in double-coated optical fibers that are caused by axial strain-induced creep deformation of polymeric coatings are investigated. These microbending losses can be minimized by suitably selecting the thickness and physical properties of the polymeric coatings, as follows. The radius, Poisson's ratio, and strain ratio of the primary coating should be increased, but the Young's modulus and relaxation time of the primary coating should be decreased. The radius, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and strain ratio of the <b>secondary</b> <b>coating</b> should be decreased, but the relaxation time of the <b>secondary</b> <b>coating</b> should be increased.
