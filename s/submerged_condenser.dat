40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} analytical investigation of boiling and condensation in a liquid-filled enclosure, {{with water and}} Freon- 113 as the working fluids, is described. The operating characteristics of a boiling system, utilizing a condenser submerged in the fluid, are presented and related to specific operational modes and thermal transport mechanisms. A lower bound of operation, corresponding to natural convection heat transfer at both the heated and condenser surfaces, is identified. Similarly, for the commonly encountered range of system operation, a condensive upper bound is identified and shown to correspond to vapor space condensation. A nondimensional vapor bubble collapse length, L c/W, is found to govern the rate and mechanism of heat transfer at the <b>submerged</b> <b>condenser</b> surface. LValues of wC > 1 condensation is found to dominate thermal transport at the condenser surface. 4 possible technique for augmenting condensation heat transfer on horizontal surfaces is examined {{in an attempt to}} raise the condensive upper bound of <b>submerged</b> <b>condenser</b> operation. A doubly-rippled surface with small, constant radius of curvature undulations is shown to yield a factor of two increases in the rate of vapor space condensation based on the projected area of the condenser surface. (cont.) A systematic design procedure for <b>submerged</b> <b>condenser</b> systems utilizing the proposed models and correlations is described and related to typical design considerations...|$|E
40|$|Papers are {{presented}} on the heat transfer and fluid mechanics in energy systems including diesel combustion analysis using rapid sampling and the numerical simulation of thermal response of architectural structures. Experiments associated with hypersonic boundary layers, {{the prediction of}} nozzle-wall pressure distribution, {{and the effects of}} nozzle geometry on an axisymmetric thrust augmentor are outlined. Predictions are made of film thickness on a roll-metering device and the thermal characteristics of multiple-surface <b>submerged</b> <b>condenser</b> modules are described. Numerical studies are made of the interaction between natural and forced convection in a complex geometry and of pressure drop and holdup in two-phase stratified flow. A numerical solution is given for viscous flows at high Reynolds numbers and for compressible boundary layer flows near separation or reattachment. The structure and transport properties in turbulent shear flows are reviewed along with the spectra of Reynolds stresses in a developing pipe flow...|$|E
3000|$|... {{particles}} in deionized water [24], CuO {{particles in}} deionized water [25] and Cu {{particles in the}} mixture of deionized water and ethylene glycol [26]. With the SANSS, the nanofluids are generated by vaporizing the solid material by the <b>submerged</b> arc and <b>condensing</b> into the base liquid in a vacuum chamber. Although these one-step physical methods are capable of synthesizing nanofluids with different nanostructures, they {{would be difficult to}} scale-up mainly because of their high cost and their demand for a vacuum.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of an}} {{investigation}} af the application of nuclear energy to various types of power plants for aircraft, calculations {{have been made to}} determine the effect of several operating conditions on the performance of condensers for mercury-turbine power plants. The analysis covered 8 range of turbine-outlet pressures from 1 to 200 pounds per square inch absolute, turbine-inlet pressures from 300 to 700 pounds per square inch absolute,and a range of condenser cooling-air pressure drops, airplane flight speeds, and altitudes. The maximum load-carrying capacity (available for the nuclear reactor, working fluid, and cargo) of a mercury-turbine powered aircraft would be about half the gross weight of the airplane at a flight speed of 509 miles per hour and an altitude of 30, 000 feet. This maximum is obtained with specific condenser frontal areas of 0. 0063 square foot per net thrust horsepower with the condenser in a nacelle and 0. 0060 square foot per net thrust horsepower with the <b>condenser</b> <b>submerged</b> in the wings (no external condenser drag) for a turbine-inlet pressure of 500 pounds per square inch absolute, a turbine-outlet pressure of 10 pounds per square inch absolute, and 8 turbine-inlet temperature of 1600 F...|$|R
