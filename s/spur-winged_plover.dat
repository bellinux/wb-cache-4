60|$|In a bird's {{relations}} with other mammals {{there is no room}} for doubt or confusion; each consistently acts after its kind; once hostile, always hostile; and if once seen to be harmless, then to be trusted for ever. The fox must always be feared and detested; his disposition, like his sharp nose and red coat, is unchangeable; so, too, with the cat, stoat, weasel, etc. On the other hand, in the presence of herbivorous mammals, birds show no sign of suspicion; they know that all these various creatures are absolutely harmless, from the big formidable-looking bull and roaring stag, to the mild-eyed, timorous hare and rabbit. It is common to see wagtails and other species attending cattle in the pastures, and keeping close to their noses, on the look-out for the small insects driven from hiding in the grass. Daws and starlings search the backs of cattle and sheep for ticks and other parasites, and it is plain that their visits are welcome. Here a joint interest unites bird and beast; it is the nearest approach to symbiosis among the higher vertebrates of this country, but is far less advanced than the partnership which exists between the rhinoceros bird and the rhinoceros or buffalo, and between the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>plover</b> and crocodile in Africa.|$|E
500|$|Herodotus thus claimed (circa 440 BC) that Nile {{crocodiles}} {{had what}} {{would now be}} called a cleaning symbiosis with the bird he called the trochilus, possibly a sandpiper; but while he {{was right about the}} existence of cleaning symbioses, there is little evidence for it in crocodiles. In 1906 Henry Scherren quoted John Mason Cook, son of travel agent Thomas Cook, as reporting from Egypt that he had seen some <b>spur-winged</b> <b>plovers</b> approach a crocodile, which opened its jaws for them: ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Spur-winged</b> <b>plovers</b> in {{the coastal}} region of the Manawatu were studied from July 1979 until January 1981. Taxonomy and {{nomenclature}} are reviewed. Dispersal throughout New Zealand and the study area are mapped. The population of the species within New Zealand appears {{to be derived from}} a northern Australian population. Behaviour, both in the flocks and territories, was studied and compared with other vanelline plovers and with the Australian population of <b>spur-winged</b> <b>plovers.</b> A previously undescribed display flight was observed similar to the song flight of the lapwing (Vanellus vanellus); differences were ascribed to differences in the morphology and ecology of the two species. The population density in the study area is low and no contact fighting was observed. Breeding success was 34. 5 %, and the average number of chicks fledged by each successful pair was 1. 6 in 1979, and 1. 7 in 1980. The breeding season extended from June to January. Mean clutch size was 3. 6, mode 4. Rapid evolution of egg size may have occurred; egg size was significantly smaller than in Southland (P < 0. 001). Territoriality, nesting, and flock behaviour were correlated with environmental factors, chiefly the level of the water table. Territories were significantly larger (P < 0. 01) than in Australia (4. 3 Ha. vs 2. 4 Ha.). Thirty eight chicks were captured and banded. In 1980 chick growth was recorded. Flock size, movement and behaviour were observed. Changes in behaviour from month to month and seasonally are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|The masked lapwing is {{the largest}} {{representative}} of the family Charadriidae. It measures from 30 to 37 cm in length and has a wingspan of 75 - 85 cm. The nominate subspecies (V. m. miles) weighs 191 - 300 g, while the southern race (V. m. novaehollandiae) is larger and weighs 296 - 412 g. The subspecies from northern Australia and New Guinea (V. m. miles) has an all-white neck and large yellow wattles with the male having a distinctive mask and larger wattles. The subspecies found in the southern and eastern states of Australia and in New Zealand (V. m. novaehollandiae), and often locally called the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>plover,</b> has a black neck-stripe and smaller wattles.

50|$|Wildlife are {{classified}} under {{a number of}} schedules; all vertebrate species not included in these lists are protected by default. The schedules are periodically amended; for example the kea was granted full protection in 1984, whereas the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>plover</b> (masked lapwing), an Australian species which naturally established itself in New Zealand in the 1930s, had its protected status removed in 2012.|$|E
50|$|Masked lapwings {{are most}} common {{around the edges}} of {{wetlands}} and in other moist, open environments, but are adaptable and can often be found in surprisingly arid areas. They can also be found on beaches and coastlines.

50|$|The masked lapwing (also {{known as}} the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>plover)</b> has carpal spurs.

There is a much-believed but incorrect myth that the spur can inject venom. The myth may have been based on fear of the masked lapwing's territorial behaviour.|$|E

50|$|The masked lapwing (Vanellus miles), {{also known}} as the masked plover and often called the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>plover</b> or just plover in its native range, is a large, common and {{conspicuous}} bird native to Australia, particularly the northern and eastern parts of the continent, New Zealand and New Guinea. It spends most of its time on the ground searching for food such as insects and worms and has several distinctive calls. There are two subspecies; the southern novaehollandiae has distinctive black markings on the shoulder and side of the chest, and is sometimes recognized as a separate species, the black-shouldered lapwing (Vanellus novaehollandiae). These brown-black, white and yellow plovers are common in Australian fields and open land.|$|E
40|$|Study Aims: • Describe {{the pattern}} of spread across New Zealand • Identify {{possible}} factors associated with the spread • Relate this {{to the spread of}} invasive species Abstract from 2014 conference programme: "The southern Australian sub-species of masked lapwing (Vanellus miles novaehollandiae) self-introduced to New Zealand as early as 1886. However, the first breeding pair was recorded in the Invercargill area of South Island in the 1932. Known as the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>plover</b> in New Zealand, it is classified as 'native', due to its establishment prior to the introduction of the Wildlife Act 1953 and was provided full protection. Over the last 90 years the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>plover</b> has established and spread rapidly across the whole of New Zealand. The impact of the spread of this species, particularly as an aviation air-strike risk, has resulted in a reclassification of this bird onto Schedule 5 of the wildlife Act with all protection status being removed. The range expansion and characteristics of this species were assessed in relation to known characteristics of invasive species. Range expansion was determined using presence or absence data on a country wide grid compiled from national surveys conducted from 1930 to 2004. The pattern of range expansion was well described by a logistic regression model. The pattern of expansion after initial establishment showed a lag followed by exponential growth phase consistent with many other invasive species. As with other successfully established invasive species, abiotic and biotic factors such as climate suitability, proximity to a novel vacant niche, propagule pressure and life history characteristics have apparently contributed to the successful establishment and spread of V. m. novaehollandea in New Zealand. ...|$|E

40|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} {{of a number}} of flightless and volant rails have been investigated using mtDNA sequence data. The third domain of the small ribosomal subunit (12 S) has been sequenced for 22 taxa, and part of the 5 ' end of the cytochrome-b gene has been sequenced for 12 taxa. Additional sequences were obtained from outgroup taxa, two species of jacana, sarus crane, <b>spur-winged</b> <b>plover</b> and kagu. Extinct rails were investigated using DNA extracted from subfossil bones, and in cases where fresh material could not be obtained from other extant taxa, feathers and museum skins were used as sources of DNA. Phylogenetic trees produced from these data have topologies that are, in general, consistent with data from DNA-DNA hybridization studies and recent interpretations based on morphology. Gallinula chloropus moorhen) groups basally with Fulica (coots), Amaurornis (= Megacrex) ineptus falls within the Gallirallus/Rallus group, and Gallinula (= Porphyrula) martinica is basal to Porphyrio (swamphens) and should probably be placed in that genus. Subspecies of Porphyrio porphyrio are paraphyletic with respect to Porphyrio mantelli (takahe). The Northern Hemisphere Rallus aquaticus is basal to the south-western Pacific Rallus (or Gallirallus) group. The flightless Rallus philippensis dieffenbachii is close to Rallus modestus and distinct from the volant Rallus philippensis, and is evidently a separate species. Porzana (crakes) appears to be more closely associated with Porphyrio than Rallus. Deep relationships among the rails remain poorly resolved. Rhynochetus jubatus (kagu) is closer to the cranes than the rails in this analysis. Genetic distances between flightless rails and their volant counterparts varied considerably with observed 12 S sequence distances, ranging from 0. 3 % (Porphyrio porphyrio melanotus and P. mantelli mantelli) to 7. 6 % (Rallus modestus and Rallus philippensis). This may be taken as an indication of the rapidity with which flightlessness can evolve, and of the persistence of flightless taxa. Genetic data supported the notion that flightless taxa were independently derived, sometimes from similar colonizing ancestors. The morphology of flightless rails is apparently frequently dominated by evolutionary parallelism although similarity of external appearance is not an indication of the extent of genetic divergence. In some cases taxa that are genetically close are morphologically distinct from one another (e. g. Rallus (philippensis) dieffenbachii and R. modestus), whilst some morphologically similar taxa are evidently independently derived (e. g. Porphyio mantelli hochstetteri and P. m. mantelli) ...|$|E
