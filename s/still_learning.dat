5|$|Alongside his {{stand-alone}} illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began {{production of}} a comic strip for Le Boy-Scout Belge, Les Aventures de Totor (The Adventures of Totor), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including speech bubbles. Illustrations were also published in Le Blé qui lève (The Wheat That Grows) and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, The Soul of the Sea. Being young and inexperienced, <b>still</b> <b>learning</b> his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived Atelier de la Fleur de Lys (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.|$|E
5|$|Warren Davis, a {{programmer}} hired {{to work on}} the action game Protector, noticed Lee's ideas, and asked if he could use them to practice programming randomness and gravity as game mechanic. Thus, he added balls that bounced from the pyramid's top to bottom. Because Davis was <b>still</b> <b>learning</b> how to program game mechanics, he wanted to keep the design simple. He also felt games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with one hand. To accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective to saving the protagonist from danger. As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb's vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game's character has landed on them. Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert's jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis stuck to his decision. Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982, but the project was only put on schedule as an actual product several months later.|$|E

Sabiston had divided the animators into five teams and split the work amongst them. However, there was poor communication between the teams, and the uniform animation style that Linklater wanted was not being implemented.

25|$|Most Hasidim {{speak the}} {{language}} of their countries of residence, but use Yiddish among themselves {{as a way of}} remaining distinct and preserving tradition. Thus, children are <b>still</b> <b>learning</b> Yiddish today, and the language, despite predictions to the contrary, is not dead. Yiddish newspapers are still published, and Yiddish fiction is being written, primarily aimed at women. Even films in Yiddish are being produced within the Hasidic community. Some Hasidic groups, such as Satmar or Toldot Aharon, actively oppose the everyday use of Hebrew, which they consider a holy tongue. The use of Hebrew for anything other than prayer and study is, according to them, profane. Hence, Yiddish is the vernacular and common tongue for many Hasidim around the world.|$|E
25|$|Montrose Academy {{follows the}} Scottish {{education}} {{system and the}} Curriculum for Excellence. In S1-S2 pupils take courses from all departments. From S3 pupils are still given a broad education but are allowed electives in the expressive arts, social sciences and other electives. This prepares them to choose 4 subjects, not including Maths and English which are mandatory, to take in S4 usually at a National 5 level. Pupils in the Senior School choose 5 {{from a range of}} Higher grade subjects where Advanced Highers (a maximum of 3) can be taken in S6. However teaching of Advanced Highers is less comprehensive. In 2009 Angus Council announced that it was dropping Advanced Higher Business Management, History and Modern Studies from the curriculum.

25|$|Thursday {{qualifying}} {{was held}} in similar weather conditions to practice, but {{was interrupted by a}} brief shower of rain close {{to the end of the}} session. Alesi carried his form over from free practice, nudging the crash barriers lining the circuit on more than one occasion to set a provisional pole position time of 1:23.754. Berger was also impressive, power-sliding through Casino Square, to the delight of the crowd, on his way to the third-fastest time, although he complained that Alesi had held him up on what he thought would have been his quickest lap of the session. The form of the Ferraris came as something of a surprise, as the 41T2's unique V12 engine configuration theoretically produced less torque than its rivals, a disadvantage on a circuit as tight as Monaco. Alesi said that he believed the results of the session were due to the extreme effort that he and Berger were putting into their driving overcoming any deficiencies with the car. The Ferraris were split by Schumacher, who felt that the rain shower had prevented him from fulfilling his potential, as he did not complete his full quota of 12laps as a result of the track conditions becoming slower. His teammate, Herbert, took provisional sixthplace. Of the Williams drivers, Hill was fourth, but Coulthard admitted that he was <b>still</b> <b>learning</b> the track on his way to 11th, 2.8seconds slower than Alesi's best. Häkkinen continued McLaren's promising form with a provisional fifthplace, but was fined $10,000 for ignoring yellow flags during the season. Blundell was back in eighth after crashing into the barriers in the closing minutes of the session.|$|E
