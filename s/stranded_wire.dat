25|$|The AWG {{tables are}} for a single, solid, round conductor. The AWG of a <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> is {{determined}} by the cross-sectional area of the equivalent solid conductor. Because there are also small gaps between the strands, a <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> will always have a slightly larger overall diameter than a solid wire with the same AWG.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stranded</b> <b>wire</b> has a {{group of}} copper wires braided or twisted together. <b>Stranded</b> <b>wire</b> is more {{flexible}} and easier to install than a large single-strand wire of the same cross section. Stranding improves wire life in applications with vibration. A particular cross-section of a stranded conductor gives it essentially the same resistance characteristics as a single-strand conductor, but with added flexibility.|$|E
25|$|Stranded wires are {{specified}} {{with three}} numbers, the overall AWG size, {{the number of}} strands, and the AWG size of a strand. The number of strands and the AWG of a strand are separated by a slash. For example, a 22 AWG 7/30 <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> is a 22 AWG wire made from seven strands of 30 AWG wire.|$|E
5000|$|... multi <b>strand</b> steel <b>wire</b> {{leaders are}} very flexible, but are {{somewhat}} more abrasive and more damage prone than single <b>strand</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{braided wire}} is {{composed}} {{of a number of}} small <b>strands</b> of <b>wire</b> braided together. Similar to <b>stranded</b> <b>wires,</b> braided wires are better conductors than solid wires. Braided wires do not break easily when flexed. Braided wires are often suitable as an electromagnetic shield in noise-reduction cables.|$|R
50|$|PC strand is {{classified}} {{according to the}} number of steel wires in a strand: 2 <b>wire</b> <b>strand,</b> 3 <b>wire</b> <b>strand,</b> 7 <b>wire</b> steel <b>strand</b> and 19 <b>wire</b> steel strand.It can be classified according to the surface morphology and can be divided into: smooth steel strand, scoring strand, mold pulling strand (compact), coated epoxy resin steel strand.They can also be classified by diameter, or intensity level, or standard.|$|R
25|$|AWG gauges {{are also}} used to {{describe}} <b>stranded</b> <b>wire.</b> In this case, it describes a wire which is equal in cross-sectional area to the total of all the cross-sectional areas of the individual strands; the gaps between strands are not counted. When made with circular strands, these gaps occupy about 10% of the wire area, thus requiring a wire about 5% thicker than equivalent solid wire.|$|E
50|$|At high frequencies, current travels {{near the}} surface of the wire because of the skin effect, {{resulting}} in increased power loss in the wire. <b>Stranded</b> <b>wire</b> might seem to reduce this effect, since the total surface area of the strands is greater than the surface area of the equivalent solid wire, but ordinary <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> does not reduce the skin effect because all the strands are short-circuited together and behave as a single conductor. A <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> will have higher resistance than a solid wire of the same diameter because the cross-section of the <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> is not all copper; there are unavoidable gaps between the strands (this is the circle packing problem for circles within a circle). A <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> with the same cross-section of conductor as a solid wire is said to have the same equivalent gauge and is always a larger diameter.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stranded</b> <b>wire</b> is {{composed}} {{of a number of}} small wires bundled or wrapped together to form a larger conductor. <b>Stranded</b> <b>wire</b> is more flexible than solid wire of the same total cross-sectional area. <b>Stranded</b> <b>wire</b> tends to be a better conductor than solid wire because the individual wires collectively comprise a greater surface area. <b>Stranded</b> <b>wire</b> is used when higher resistance to metal fatigue is required. Such situations include connections between circuit boards in multi-printed-circuit-board devices, where the rigidity of solid wire would produce too much stress as a result of movement during assembly or servicing; A.C. line cords for appliances; musical instrument cables; computer mouse cables; welding electrode cables; control cables connecting moving machine parts; mining machine cables; trailing machine cables; and numerous others.|$|E

50|$|End {{terminals}} (wire ferrules) {{are used}} to protect the stripped ends of <b>stranded</b> <b>wires</b> {{so that they can}} be connected to terminals without damage to individual wires. When using certain clamp types, such as the lift terminals, no wire end ferrules are required.|$|R
50|$|Wire {{lines are}} {{frequently}} used as leaders {{to prevent the}} fishing line from being severed by toothy fish. Usually braided from several metal <b>strands,</b> <b>wire</b> lines may be made of stainless steel, titanium, {{or a combination of}} metal alloys coated with plastic.|$|R

50|$|Simple crimp {{connectors}} {{are typically}} used to terminate <b>stranded</b> <b>wire.</b> Specialised crimp connectors are also used, for example as signal connectors on coaxial cables in applications at high radio frequencies (VHF, UHF).|$|E
5000|$|Assembly of a screw {{connection}} requires some care in workmanship to ensure proper removal of insulation, containment of all <b>wire</b> <b>strands,</b> and the adequate tightening of the screw. If the wire diameter is small {{in relation to}} the size of the screw, the wire may be cut through by the over-tightening of the screw. This is less likely to occur when a wire is clamped between two plates by the action of a screw. Since <b>wire</b> <b>strands</b> may not be contained by the screw head in a basic screw terminal, <b>stranded</b> <b>wires</b> may be crimped into a ferrule to prevent the bridging of terminals; this partly offsets the economy of a [...] "bare" [...] wire termination.|$|R

50|$|The {{diameter}} in {{the table}} below {{is that of a}} solid rod with the given conductor area in circular mils. <b>Stranded</b> <b>wire</b> is around 5% larger in diameter to allow for gaps between the strands, depending on the number and size of strands.|$|E
50|$|However, {{for many}} {{high-frequency}} applications, proximity effect is {{more severe than}} skin effect, and in some limited cases, simple <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> can reduce proximity effect. For better performance at high frequencies, litz wire, which has the individual strands insulated and twisted in special patterns, may be used.|$|E
50|$|Uniform {{field theory}} is {{a formula for}} {{determining}} the effective electrical resistance of a parallel wire system. By calculating the mean square field acting throughout a section of coil, formulae are obtained for the effective resistances of single- and multi-layer solenoidal coils of either solid or <b>stranded</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E

50|$|Barbed wire cannot {{effectively}} contain pigs, goats or sheep. Where {{these animals}} are to be fenced, woven wire (called sheep or pig netting in Britain, sheep fence or hog fence in the United States) is used instead, often {{with one or more}} <b>strands</b> of barbed <b>wire</b> at the top. For swine, a ground-level barbed <b>wire</b> <b>strand</b> or electrified <b>wire</b> is used as well to prevent them digging beneath the fence.|$|R
50|$|The larger size <b>stranded</b> {{aluminum}} <b>wires</b> don't {{have the}} same historical problems as solid aluminum wires, and the common terminations for larger size wires are dual-rated terminations called lugs. These lugs are typically made with a coated aluminum alloy, which can accommodate either an aluminum wire or a copper <b>wire.</b> Larger <b>stranded</b> aluminum <b>wiring</b> with proper terminations is generally considered safe, since long-term installations have proven its reliability.|$|R
50|$|Tinsel wire {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} wire used for applications that require high mechanical flexibility but low current-carrying capacity. Tinsel wire is commonly used in cords of telephones, handsets, headphones, and small electrical appliances. It is far more resistant to metal fatigue failure than either <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> or solid wire.|$|E
50|$|It is {{most often}} used to prevent rust, but is also {{commonly}} applied {{to the ends of}} <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> used as electrical conductors to prevent oxidation (which increases electrical resistance), and to keep them from fraying or unraveling when used in various wire connectors like twist-ons, binding posts, or terminal blocks, where stray strands can cause a short circuit.|$|E

25|$|For low {{to medium}} frequencies, {{conductors}} {{can be divided}} into <b>stranded</b> <b>wires,</b> each insulated from one another, and the relative positions of individual strands specially arranged within the conductor bundle. Wire constructed using this technique is called Litz wire. This measure helps to partially mitigate skin effect by forcing more equal current throughout the total cross section of the <b>stranded</b> conductors. Litz <b>wire</b> is used for making high-Q inductors, reducing losses in flexible conductors carrying very high currents at lower frequencies, and in the windings of devices carrying higher radio frequency current (up to hundreds of kilohertz), such as switch-mode power supplies and radio frequency transformers.|$|R
