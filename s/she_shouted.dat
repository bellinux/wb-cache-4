500|$|The Puritan {{leaders of}} the Massachusetts Bay Colony gloated over Hutchinson's {{suffering}} and also that of Mary Dyer, a follower who suffered the premature and stillbirth of a severely deformed infant. The leaders classified the women's misfortunes as the judgement of God.

Gradually, more and more dancers joined Madonna, and together they started jumping on stage. Williams appeared on the screens to sing his lines.

500|$|With {{help from}} Mimi and Lennon's headmaster, Lennon was {{accepted}} into the Liverpool College of Art because his aunt insisted {{that he should have}} some sort of academic qualifications, even though Lennon was beginning to show an interest in music. She opposed the idea of him forming a band and disapproved of McCartney because he was, [...] "working class", calling him [...] "John's little friend". When she later met Harrison, she [...] "hated him" [...] because of his thick Liverpudlian accent and Teddy Boy clothes. Lennon and McCartney often met at Mendips to write songs, and rehearsed in the glass-panelled porch {{at the front of the}} house, which was the only place they were allowed to play. She once asked Parkes to take her to The Cavern to see Lennon and the Beatles play, but when she descended into the damp, dark cellar; full of screaming teenagers, <b>she</b> <b>shouted</b> to Parkes, [...] "Get him [...] out, get him out!

The last person to confirm seeing Lucan alive, Susan Maxwell-Scott, told the court that the earl looked [...] "dishevelled", and his hair [...] "a little ruffled". His trousers had a damp patch on the right hip. Lucan had told her that he was walking, or passing by the house when he saw Veronica being attacked by a man.
