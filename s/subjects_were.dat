5|$|The {{size of the}} pre-Reform {{electorate}} {{is difficult}} to estimate. Voter registration was lacking, and many boroughs were rarely contested in elections. It is estimated that immediately before the 1832 Reform Act, 400,000 English <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> entitled to vote, and that after passage, the number rose to 650,000, an increase of more than 60%.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the first}} study, the second one also {{included}} a task relating to disliking letters. <b>Subjects</b> <b>were</b> asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it. This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While {{there was a large}} consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.|$|E
5|$|Examinations {{are taken}} {{at the end of}} every term as opposed to at the end of the year.

5|$|King Andrew {{transferred}} Béla from Slavonia to Transylvania in 1226. In Slavonia, he was {{succeeded by}} his brother, Coloman. As Duke of Transylvania, Béla adopted an expansionist policy {{aimed at the}} territories over the Carpathian Mountains. He supported the Dominicans' proselytizing activities among the Cumans, who dominated these lands. In 1227 he crossed the mountains and met Boricius, a Cuman chieftain, who had decided to convert to Christianity. At their meeting, Boricius and his <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> baptized and acknowledged Béla's suzerainty. Within a year, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania was established in their lands.|$|E

5|$|Paintings by Bellette {{were among}} those of twelve Australian artists {{included}} in the 1953 Arts Council of Great Britain exhibition in London, five regional British cities, and at the Venice Biennale. Bellette {{was one of only}} two women represented, the other being Constance Stokes. As with her Sulman prize-winners, Bellette's <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> classically themed works: Electra (1944) and Oedipus (1945). Arts Council chairman Kenneth Clark was disappointed with the response of British critics to the exhibition, and their focus on a theme of nationhood paid little regard to the works of Bellette and several others.|$|E

The algorithm shows a good correlation for length and width values. In fact, for length values, the average correlation among human <b>subjects</b> <b>is</b> 0.97, whereas the correlation of the proposed algorithm to human <b>subjects</b> <b>is</b> 0.99. Similarly, for width values, the average correlation among human <b>subjects</b> <b>is</b> 0.89, whereas the correlation of the proposed algorithm to human <b>subjects</b> <b>is</b> 0.95. In the case of orientation measures, the correlation is not as good as for the other characterization parameters. In fact, the average correlation among human <b>subjects</b> <b>is</b> 0.92, whereas the correlation of the proposed algorithm to human <b>subjects</b> <b>is</b> only 0.89.

5|$|She {{spent much}} of her {{childhood}} at St Paul's Walden and at Glamis Castle, the Earl's ancestral home in Scotland. She was educated at home by a governess until the age of eight, and was fond of field sports, ponies and dogs. When she started school in London, she astonished her teachers by precociously beginning an essay with two Greek words from Xenophon's Anabasis. Her best <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> literature and scripture. After returning to private education under a German Jewish governess, Käthe Kübler, she passed the Oxford Local Examination with distinction at age thirteen.|$|E
5|$|Systematic {{interest}} in the letter preference began in 1959 with brand-preference studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton.

While there was not a great deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the coefficients of concordance were low), a strong positive correlation was found between a letter's average rank and how frequently it occurred as an initial letter of family names.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} {{recorded}} {{of the first}} twenty years of Egbert's reign, apart from campaigns against the Cornish in the 810s.

Relations between Mercian kings and their Kentish <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> distant. Kentish ealdormen did not attend the court of King Coenwulf, who quarrelled with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury (805–832) over the control of Kentish monasteries; Coenwulf's primary concern seems to have been {{to gain access to the}} wealth of Kent. His successors Ceolwulf I (821–23) and Beornwulf (823–26) restored relations with Archbishop Wulfred, and Beornwulf appointed a sub-king of Kent, Baldred.|$|E

5|$|An Act of Parliament in 1857 {{provided}} {{for the establishment of}} a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made many works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams, whose <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E.

5|$|In 1294 the French king {{declared}} the English duchy of Aquitaine forfeit, and {{war broke out}} between the two countries. Edward I embarked on a wide-scale and costly project of building alliances with other princes on the Continent, and preparing an invasion. When the king, at the parliament of March 1297 in Salisbury, demanded military service from his earls, Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, refused in his capacity of marshal of England. The argument was that the king's <b>subjects</b> <b>were</b> not obliged to serve abroad if not {{in the company of}} the king, but Edward insisted on taking his army to Flanders while sending his earls to Gascony.|$|E
5|$|The early 9th century, however, was {{a period}} of direct {{imitation}} of Chinese models making kanshi the major form of poetry at the time. In the late 9th century, waka and the development of kana script rose simultaneously with the general revival of traditional values, culminating in the compilation of the first imperial waka anthology, the Kokinshū, in 905. It was followed in 951 by the Gosen Wakashū; in all seven imperial anthologies were compiled in the Heian period.

40|$|Among {{philosophical}} {{approaches to}} the notion of subject, at least three main historical stages may be distinguished: at the metaphysical stage, the structure of the <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> that of a substance; at the transcendental stage (Kant and Fichte), the <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> viewed as a unifying polarity of horizons; at the psychoanalytical stage, the <b>subject</b> <b>is</b> defined as a gap structure.
