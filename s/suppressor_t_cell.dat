5000|$|The {{resolution}} of the I-J paradox involves a process of mutual selection (or [...] "co-selection") of suppressor T cells and helper T cells, meaning that (a) those suppressor T cells are selected that have V regions with complementarity to as many helper T cells as possible, and (b) helper T cells are selected {{not only on the}} basis of their V regions having some affinity for MHC class II, but also on the basis of the V regions having some affinity for the selected <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> V regions. The helper T cells and suppressor T cells that are co-selected are then a mutually stabilizing construct, and for a given mouse genome, more than one such mutually stabilizing set can exist.

50|$|Studies {{of human}} {{subjects}} {{with a history}} of leishmania infection suggest that modulation of CD8+ suppressor T cells is, at least partly, mediated by cytokines. Leishmania specific CD4+ helper T cells predominate in adults with strong protective immunity (skin-test positive with no history of clinical infection). When added to autologous leishmania infected macrophages these T cells cause parasite death and secretion of large amounts of interferon-gamma and lymphotoxin. CD8+ T suppressor cells predominate in patients with no protective immunity (visceral leishmaniasis patients). When added to autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated after successful treatment, these T cells inhibit interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation and increase interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 secretion. A soluble factor(s) generated by antigen or phytohemagglutinin stimulation of leishmania-specific CD4+ helper T cells from skin-test positive adults killed CD8+ T cells but not CD4+ helper T cells when added to culture media. Soluble factors generated by antigen stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from skin-test positive adults prevented CD8+ <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> mediated increases in interleukin-10 secretion. These findings suggest that antigen stimulation of CD4+ helper T cells results in production of cytokines that kill or down regulate CD8+ T suppressor cells. Once the leishmania infection has been eliminated and leishmania antigens are gone, CD8+ T suppressor cells down-regulate CD4+ T helper cells. Isolation of cytokines that inhibit and kill CD8+ T suppressor cells might be useful in treating diseases that involve immune suppression such as leishmaniasis, AIDS, and certain cancers.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} this study confirm results {{published}} by others by showing that sublethal whole-body irradiation of mice bearing immunogenic tumors can result in complete tumor regression.

This evidence, plus the demonstration that irradiation fails to cause regression of tumors growing in immunocompetent mice, is consistent with the hypothesis that irradiation-induced regression is immunologically mediated, and that it depends on the ability of irradiation to preferentially eliminate <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> By using passive transfer assays to measure the production of effector <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> and <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> against time of tumor growth, it was shown that irradiation of tumor-bearing mice on day 5 of tumor growth resulted in a failure to generate <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> on the one hand, and in a sustained production, effector <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> on the other. In other words, irradiation prevented the concomitant antitumor immune response from being downregulated by <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> However, giving radiation on day 1 of tumor growth, in contrast to giving it 3 - 6 d later, caused immunodepression and enhancement of tumor growth. This is in keeping with published evidence showing that, whereas resting effector <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are highly radiosensitive, antigen- activated effector <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are relatively radioresistant.

In our previous studies of the cellular mechanism of suppression of antibody response in the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) 1 system, we have demonstrated that at least three distinct subsets of suppressor T cells are involved in the regulatory T cell interactions (1). 2 These T cell populations involve suppressor T cells that produce antigen-specific <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> factor (TsF), suppressor T cells bearing a receptor for TsF (acceptor-suppressor T cells), and effector-suppressor T cells. The KLH-specific TsF with antigen-binding moiety and I-J determinants, which is composed of two polypeptide chains, is obtained from Lyt- 2 + suppresor T cells. In the initial step of the suppressor pathways, the KLH-specific <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> factor (KLH-TsF) acts on and activates Lyt-l+, 2 + acceptor-suppressor T cells. In the second step, the activated acceptor-suppressor T cells generate new effector-suppressor T cells that directly suppress the responses mounted by B cells and helper T cells. Therefore, the antigen-specific TsF seems not to be an effector-suppresso...|$|E
40|$|The {{rearrangement}} and transcription of the {{antigen receptor}} alpha, beta and gamma genes were investigated in murine antigen-specific <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> lines, to establish whether the <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> subset expresses the same antigen receptor transcripts previously found in helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The genomic {{organization of the}} alpha, beta and gamma chain loci was investigated using probes representative of the entire gene or fragments from variable, joining and constant regions. The present results show that in functional suppressor T cells the three antigen receptor genes are all rearranged. The beta gene is expressed in all the tested cell lines, while {{the expression of the}} alpha and gamma genes is variable. In one cell line (LH 8) alpha and gamma genes are not efficiently transcribed; in the other cell line (LA 41) the gamma mRNA is found in amounts similar to beta mRNA, whereas the alpha gene is expressed at low levels. These data suggest that in suppressor T cells no direct correlation exists between the expression of alpha, beta and gamma antigen receptor genes and the effector function...|$|E
40|$|Regulation of immune {{responses}} involves {{complex interaction}} between {{a number of}} T cell sets (1, 2). These interactions often require a genetic homology between the T cells involved for the functional activity to be manifest. Two gene polymorphisms control genetic restrictions between cells of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> circuits. The first major restricting element of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> interactions concerns antigens of the major histocompatibility gene complex (MHC). 1 The other restricting element involves genes encoded in or linked to the variable region (V) of the Igh gene loci. The {{question of how the}} Igh-V-related gene products involved in T suppressor cell interactions relate to the antigen specificity of the cellular interactions is not well known, although a number of investigators have suggested an idiotype-antiidiotype-like interaction similar to the one originally proposed by Jerne (3). Investigations into the nature of genetically restricted T cell interactions have been greatly facilitated by the use of cell-free products that replace the activity of functional T cell sets. One such product is an antigen-specific, T cell-derive...|$|E
40|$|This {{study shows}} that {{surgical}} removal of the meth A fibrosarcoma from its semisyngeneic host fails to result in postexcision immunity to growth of a tumor implant unless the host already has acquired a mechanism of concomitant immunity to growth of an implant. Therefore, tumor excision does not cause immunity to be generated but preserves a mechanism of concomitant immunity that already exists and which otherwise would eventually undergo down-regulation {{under the influence of}} <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> Removal of the tumor after it has grown large enough to cause the T cell-mediated suppression of concomitant immunity does not result in the reemergence of immunity. Instead, the host remains unable to generate concomitant immunity to a second tumor {{for a long period of}} time and retains, for at least 31 d, <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> able to passively transfer suppression to appropriate recipients. Like the <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> responsible for active suppression of concomitant immunity, the <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> responsible for "memory" suppression are of the Ly- 1 + 2 - phenotype. The results indicate that progressive tumor growth results in a state of immunological tolerance of tumor-specific, transplantation antigens that can persist in the apparent absence of tumor antigens...|$|R
40|$|Although alloantigen-specific <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are {{generated}} in MLR, the cellular signals {{that lead to}} activation of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> as opposed to cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are unknown. The current study was undertaken to characterize interactions among <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> subsets involved in the generation of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in MLR. Human peripheral blood Leu- 2 + (suppressor/cytotoxic) and Leu- 3 + (helper/inducer) <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> subsets were activated with allogeneic non-T cells and then examined for their inductive effects on fresh autologous <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> Fresh Leu- 2 + cells proliferated in response to alloantigen-primed Leu- 3 + cells and subsequently suppressed the response of fresh autologous Leu- 3 + cells to the original, but not third party, allogeneic stimulator non-T cells. Moreover, only Leu- 2 + cells that lacked the 9. 3 marker, an antigen present on the majority of <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> including precursors of cytotoxic <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> differentiated into <b>suppressor</b> cells. The alloantigen-specific suppressive effect of Leu- 2 +, 9. 3 -cells was not mediated by cytolysis of allogeneic stimulator cells, nor could it be explained by alteration of MLR kinetics. Suppression was observed only when activated Leu- 2 + cells were added to fresh MLRs within 24 h of initiation of cultures, suggesting that these cells block an early phase of the activation of Leu- 3 + cells in MLR. These results indicate that alloantigen-primed inducer <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> can activate alloantigen- specific <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{in the absence of}} allogeneic stimulator cells...|$|R
40|$|Following {{injection}} of rat red cells, mice develop anti-red cell autoantibodies and subsequently <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> specific for these. Likewise, following recovery from non-lethal malaria, they develop <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> which suppress the anti-lymphocyte autoantibodies induced by lethal malaria parasites. Neither type of suppressor cell affected non-autoantibody {{components of the}} response, nor a response to sheep red cells. However, there was variable but significant cross-suppression of the respective autoantibody responses by both types of suppressor cell. Possible reasons for this unexpected cross-reaction are discussed...|$|R
