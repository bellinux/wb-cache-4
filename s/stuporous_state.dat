5000|$|There {{have been}} several Japanese reports of {{intoxication}} following accidental consumption of this species. In a report of five cases of unintentional ingestion in Miyagi Prefecture from the period 1980-84, anxiety and panic were common to all poisoning victims, even if the anxiety was preceded by an initial period of euphoria. In a later analysis of 10 cases of poisoning by this species, Musha and colleagues noted that poisoning [...] "produced alterations of consciousness but also disturbances of consciousness such as strong drowsiness, short-term sleeping, fluctuation of vigilance and <b>stuporous</b> <b>state</b> with amnesia." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stupor (From Latin stupere, [...] "be stunned or amazed") is {{the lack}} of {{critical}} mental function and a level of consciousness wherein a sufferer is almost entirely unresponsive and only responds to base stimuli such as pain. Those in a <b>stuporous</b> <b>state</b> are rigid, mute and only appear to be conscious, as the eyes are open and follow surrounding objects. The word derives from the Latin [...] ("numbness, insensibility"). Being characterized by impairments to reactions to external stimuli, it usually appears in infectious diseases, complicated toxic states (e.g. heavy metals), severe hypothermia, mental illnesses (e.g. schizophrenia, severe clinical depression), epilepsy, vascular illnesses (e.g. hypertensive encephalopathy), shock (e.g. learning of a death or surviving a car crash), neoplasms (e.g. brain tumors), vitamin D deficiency and other maladies.|$|E
40|$|Vertebrobasilar {{junction}} entrapment {{due to a}} clivus fracture is a rare clinical observation. The present {{case report}} describes a 54 -yr-old man who sustained a major craniofacial injury. The patient displayed a <b>stuporous</b> mental <b>state</b> (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS]= 8) and left hemiparesis (Grade 3). The initial computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a right subdural hemorrhage in the frontotemporal region, with a midline shift and longitudinal clival fracture. A decompressive craniectomy with removal of the hematoma was performed. Two days after surgery, a follow-up CT scan showed cerebellar and brain stem infarction, and a CT angiogram revealed occlusion of the left vertebral artery and entrapment of vertebrobasilar junction by the clival fracture. A decompressive suboccipital craniectomy was performed and the patient gradually recovered. This {{appears to be a}} rare case of traumatic vertebrobasilar junction entrapment due to a longitudinal clival fracture, including a cerebellar infarction caused by a left vertebral artery occlusion.

40|$|Injury of the {{oculomotor nerve}} {{in a patient}} with {{traumatic}} brain injury: diffusion tensor tractography study A 24 -year-old female who had suffered a pedestrian traffic acci-dent underwent conservative management for traumatic diffuse axonal injury at the Department of Neurosurgery in a University Hospital. The patient showed a <b>stuporous</b> mental <b>state</b> at admission and the patient’s Glasgow Coma Scale score was 9 at that time. Brain MRI performed at 7 weeks from onset showed leukomalactic lesions in the body, isthmus and splenium of the corpus callosum (figure 1 A). Her right eyelid showed complete ptosis, and her right eye was deviated outward and downward in primary position. She {{was not able to}} move her eyes in any direction, except for abduction, and her right pupil was dilated and non-reactive to light. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a form of diffusion-weighted MRI {{that can be used for}} reconstruction of images of neural tracts, was acquired at 7 weeks after onset using a six-channel head coil on a 1. 5 T Philips Gyroscan Intera (Philips, Ltd, Best, the Netherlands) with single-shot echo-planar imaging. For each Figure 1 (A) T 2 -weighted brain MR images at 7 weeks after onset show leukomalactic lesions in the body, isthmus and splenium of the corpus callosum. (B) Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) of the right oculomotor nerve of the patient showed a discontinuation (blue arrow) in the area where the right nerve exited the midbrain, compared with the left oculomotor nerve of the patient and a normal control subject. On the axial colour map of the midbrain, a defect was observed in the anteromedial portion of the right midbrain in front of the discontinued oculomotor nerve (sky blue arrow).

50|$|In {{one of the}} few {{reported}} cases, {{the subject}} presented with muscle weakness and fatigue, muscle twitching, excessive sweating and salivation, small joint pain, itching and weight loss. The subject also developed confusional episodes with spatial and temporal disorientation, visual and auditory hallucinations, complex behavior during sleep and progressive nocturnal insomnia associated with diurnal drowsiness. There was also severe constipation, urinary incontinence, and excessive lacrimation. When left alone, the subject would slowly lapse into a <b>stuporous</b> <b>state</b> with dreamlike episodes characterized by complex and quasi-purposeful gestures and movements (enacted dreams). Marked hyperhidrosis and excessive salivation were evident. Neurological examination disclosed diffuse muscle twitching and spontaneous and reflex myoclonus, slight muscle atrophy in the limbs, absence of tendon reflexes in the lower limbs and diffuse erythema especially on the trunk with scratching lesions of the skin.Compulsive behaviours, stereotypies and reduplicative paramnesias can be part of the CNS spectrum.|$|E

40|$|V alproic acid (VPA) and its derivatives, valproate and divalproex, are {{anticonvulsant}} and moodstabilizing drugs used in {{the treatment}} of epilepsy and acute mania as well as for pro phylaxis of migraine headaches. Although VPA is gen erally considered a safe and welltolerated drug, rare but serious complications may occur in some patients, such as hepatic failure, pancreatitis, thrombocytopenia, and hyperammonemic encephalopathy. 1, 2 Although symptoms of VPA–induced hyperammonemic enceph alopathy may be mild, this condition can progress to stupor and coma and may be fatal without appropriate management. However, VPA–induced hyperammone mic encephalopathy can be easily reversed once VPA is discontinued, particularly if diagnosis occurs in a timely manner. 3, 4 This article reports the case of a 45 yearold man diagnosed with schizophrenia and epilepsy who experienced a recurrent <b>stuporous</b> <b>state</b> and hyperam monemia associated with chronic VPA treatment.

40|$|BackgroundHashimoto’s {{encephalopathy}} (HE) {{is a rare}} immunological neuropsychiatric disorder {{characterized by}} increased antithyroid antibodies and mixed neurological and psychiatric symptoms. HE has been previously discussed as a differential diagnosis for rapid progressive dementia. However, most of these patients suffered from additional neurological symptoms, like ataxia or seizures. Case presentationHere, we present {{the case of a}} 59 -year-old female patient suffering rapid onset dementia with salient frontal executive dysfunction. She developed rapid onset symptoms, including apathy, verbal depletion up to a <b>stuporous</b> <b>state,</b> severe working memory deficits, evidence of primitive reflexes, disturbed Luria’s three-step test, and micturition disorder. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid was normal. The serum analyses showed increased antithyroid (antithyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin) antibodies. In the cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, supratentorial deep and peripheral white matter lesions were found; the electroencephalography showed intermittent slowing, and the [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) depicted medial and superior dorsolateral frontal hypometabolism. Several different psychopharmacological therapeutic approaches with various neuroleptics, antidepressants, and high doses of lorazepam were unsuccessful. Due to the organic alterations, including increased antithyroid antibodies, HE was suspected. Against expectations, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids proved to be ineffective and was associated with worsening symptoms. However, escalated treatment with plasmapheresis over 5 days led to significant improvement in all reported symptoms and in psychometric testing. The neuropsychological improvement was stable over a 6 -month follow-up period, and the FDG-PET normalized. ConclusionThis case report reveals that (1) HE can mimic rapid onset dementia with predominantly frontal dysfunction; (2) this syndrome can be successfully treated in the context of HE; and (3) plasmapheresis can be effective in such a disease constellation. The detection of the immunological causes of rapid onset dementia and other psychiatric syndromes is important because it opens opportunities for new, innovative immunosuppressive treatment options...|$|E
40|$|The {{advancement}} in surgiology made {{in recent years}} has been due, to a large extent, to the development in anesthetic methods. The greatest credit goes to the closed circuit anesthesia which is the most superior and useful method now in use. However, skill in administration techniques as well as high costs of operation involved sets limits to popularization of this method in Japan where general economic conditions have deteriorated. With a view of finding some substitute for this method the author made investigations on the application of evipan natrium (hereinafter to be referred to as EN) as an anesthetic using cyclopan natrium and ouropan natrium which had been synthesized in Japan. The results of the basic experiments are as follows: 1) The minimum lethal dose in the mouse was 0. 35 Gr/Kg. It had broad safety range, with the difference between anesthetic and lethal dose being 3 - 8 times the amount required for causing sleep. 2) Tests by the Knipping apparatus showed that the breathing as well as consumption of oxygen per minute was reduced. 3) Tests by the Barcroft apparatus indicated that the rate of saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen decreased in all the cases under investigation. 4) Electrocardiogram showed temporary myocardiac disorder of slight degree. 5) B. S. P. tests showed no hepatitic disorder. 6) Lowering in blood pressure and an increase in pulse rate and breathing were observed immediately after administration. These clinical changes, however, were temporary and slight, giving no cause far concern. The experiments undertaken on the anesthesia of short duration in 53 cases revealed that an average of total anesthesia of 16 minutes duration was achieved by administering 1 cc of the drug for each 10 seconds before sleep was caused, plus double the amount required for causing sleep. In the experiments on anesthesia of long duration, the drug was administered to 132 cases, to which narcopon-scopolamine had been medicated as basal anesthesia, in 6 different ways asfollows: 1. Induction anesthesia. 2. Intramuscular injections. 3. A combination of intramuscular injections and repeated intravenous injections. 4. A combination of intramuscular injections and drop by drop intravenous infusions. 5. Repeated intravenous injections. 6. Drop by drop intravenous infusions. The time required for surgical operations of the cases under study were about one hour twenty minutes on the average, with the longest one requiring 3 hours. Intramuscular injections of the drug produced only <b>stuporous</b> <b>state.</b> A combination of intramuscular injections and drop by drop infusions or repeated intravenous injections required smaller amount of drug in producing unconsciousness than when these methods were employed singly, thereby reducing the toxic effects on patients. Drop by drop infusions had smaller influence than intravenous injections possibly because of the slow rate of administration. When the merits of the different methods were evaluated, the following method proved to be the simplest one by which anesthesia of long duration could be achieved with the least amount of the drug and the smallest influence on blood pressure, etc., enabling the performance of surgical operations without hindrances: 0. 5 gr of NE is injected intravenously and narcopon-scopolamine is injected in 2 or 3 instalments before the operation. During the operation, EN in Ringer 2 ̆ 7 s solution is infused drop by drop...|$|E
40|$|The auther took {{observation}} to {{find some}} clue for pathogenesis of schizophrenia, on certain physical natures of erythrocytes. attacking the most general somatic aspect above all, on their diameter, specific gravity, number, hematocrit value, volume, thickness, spheric index (spread of erythrocytes), inverse spheric index (swell or dilation of erythrocytes), {{as well as their}} resistance against NaCl solution. In Ist chapter, the auther took investigation to know whether the erythroeytes of schizophrenics had specific natures. compared to those of normal subjects or non-schizophrenics; moreover examined if there existed any difference even for various clinical types or states of schizophrenics. In 2 nd chapter, the auther investigated about changes in the physical properties of schizophrenic erythrocytes by electric shock therapy, besides if they had certain special differences from those of depression and neurosis, and examined the changes between acute or chronic progressive schizophrenic types, by comparative study. In 3 rd chapter, the auther examined as to those effects occurred by insulin shock therapy on the physical properties of schizophrenic erythrocytes. The results of the investigation were summarized as follows; 1 st chapter. 1) Examined; normal, 20 cases; non-schizophrenics, 22; schizophrenics, 60; respectively, male and female were same in number. 2) Schizophrenic erythrocytes are discovered to have a large diameter, rather thin, and small in volume. Their spheric index proved below 0. 23; their inverse spheric index, above 40. The specific gravity of the total blood and the blood plasma proved heavy, but that of erythrocytes suffered no changes. As to resistance, they proved an incrcase in the width of it due to the shift of the maximum resistance, which brought about an increase in their resistance. 3) The volume, thickness, spheric index, and inverse spheric index etc. of schizophrenic erythrocytes, compared to those of non-schizophrenics, indicated specific changes. 4) Erythrocytes in excitatory state of schizophrenic is larger and flatter than those in stuporous; as special features in <b>stuporous</b> <b>state,</b> schizophrenic erythrocytes proved light in their gravity, while numerous. 5) While becomes remission, the diameter of erythrocytes reduces compared to worse time: thickness, spheric index, inverse spheric index, resistance, and number, all come back to their former normal state, but on the contrary, their specific gravity and volume indicate even a rise. 2 nd chapter. 1) The physical changes taking place in erythrocytes in those three periods, i. e., immediately before as well as after, 90 minutes after E. C. T., were duly laid under observation, employing 26 schizophrenic cases, 12 non-schizophrenic; summing up, 38 cases. 2) Such as the erythrocytes diameter, the specific gravity of total blood as well as blood plasma, hematocrit value, volume, thickness of erythrocytes. each showed certain degree of increase by E. C. T.; after 90 minutes, it relapsed to the direction of before E. C. T., and the specifie gravity of erythrocytes decreased immediately after E. C. T., contrary to the changes of total blood or blood plasma, and then it became heavier again after 90 minutes. Both spheric index and inverse spheric index altered their course toward increase by E. C. T., which recovered as before, after 90 minutes. 3) Between schizophrenics and non-schizophrenics, essential differences are as to those changes in the specific gravity of erythrocytes and in their number, the specific gravity in schizophrenics being slow to regain its self-same state, while their number in non-schizophrenics though regained normal self, it keeped on abating trend in schizophrenics. The resistance of schizophrenic erythrocytes was weakend by E. C. T. and recovered afterwards. The width of resistance, though enlarged itself, after a while underwent certain shrinkage...|$|E
