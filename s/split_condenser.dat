50|$|Two days later, {{the cargo}} ship got {{underway}} for New York harbor; proceeded down Delaware Bay; and ultimately dropped anchor off Tompkinsville, Staten Island, {{on the morning}} of 27 January. After initially shifting to Bush Terminal pier, South Brooklyn, on the 29th, she moored at pier 61, North River, New York City, on 2 February. There, she loaded 5,236 tons of general cargo (including a large quantity of wheat flour) and prepared for her maiden voyage. However, her engineers discovered several <b>split</b> <b>condenser</b> tubes in her boilers before the trip could begin, and an inspection board convened and visited the ship on 15 February.|$|E
40|$|The work of {{the thesis}} is to present a {{comparison}} of three different two-phase ejector refrigeration cycles {{as well as a}} comparison to an expansion valve refrigeration cycle with two evaporation temperatures. An analytical comparison of the theoretical COPs of the ejector cycles shall be presented. Based on results of numerical simulations, appropriate modifications of the existing ejector test facility shall be carried out. The student will make the design of the modifications. Finally a set of experiments shall be planned and performed for different options of the ejector cycle (with vs. without vapor liquid separator, single vs. dual evaporator, diffuser outlet <b>split</b> vs. <b>condenser</b> outlet <b>split)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Prover: We {{facilitate}} modal {{theorem proving}} in a first-order resolution calculus implemented in SPASS Version 0. 77 [4]. SPASS uses ordered resolution and ordered factoring, it supports <b>splitting</b> and branch <b>condensing</b> (<b>splitting</b> amounts to case analysis while branch condensing resembles branch pruning in the Logics Workbench), {{it has an}} extensive set of reduction rules including tautology deletion, subsumption and condensing, and it supports dynamic sort theories by additional inference and reduction rules. The translation we use is the optimised functional translation [2]. It maps normal propositional modal logics into a class of path logics. Path logics are clausal logics over {{the language of the}} monadic fragment of sorted first-order logic with a special binary function symbol for defining accessibility. Clauses of path logics are restricted in that only Skolem terms which are constants may occur and the prefix stability property holds. Ordinary resolution without any refinement strategies is a decision procedure for the path logics associated with K(m) andKT(m) [3]. Our decision procedure for S 4 uses an a priori term depth bound. Availability: SPASS and a routine for the translation of modal formulae are available fro...|$|R
40|$|In {{developing}} physical theories {{analogical reasoning}} {{has been found}} to be very powerful, as attested by a number of important historical examples. An analogy between two apparently different phenomena, once established, allows one to transfer information and bring new concepts from one phenomenon to the other. Here we discuss an important analogy between two widely different physical problems, namely, the Jahn-Teller distortion in molecular physics and the Rashba spin <b>splitting</b> in <b>condensed</b> matter physics. By exploring their conceptual and mathematical features and by searching for the counterparts between them, we examine the orbital texture in Jahn-Teller systems, as the counterpart of the spin texture of the Rashba physics, and put forward a possible way of experimentally detecting the orbital texture. Finally, we discuss the analogy by comparing the coexistence of linear Rashba+Dresselhaus effects and Jahn-Teller problems for specific symmetries, which allow for non-trivial spin and orbital textures, respectively.

40|$|In {{distillation}} columns with condenser temperatures significantly below room temperature, {{such as in}} demethanizer towers, {{it is essential to}} minimize the expensive energy requirements of the refrigeration cycle that produces the tower reflux. A partial solution can be found by expanding the gaseous distillate to decrease its temperature; another solution is to use the cooler distillate to reduce the temperature of the tower feed. In this way, {{it has been shown that}} precooling only part of the feed brings about a significant decrease of its temperature, as well as decreases of the related minimum reflux ratio and finally the condenser duty. The fraction of the precooled feed has an optimum value that must be determined by means of a sensitivity analysis. By repeating the simulation of the tower and its auxiliaries, it is possible to find the optimal configuration, i. e., the configuration that minimizes the energy requirements at the condenser, by varying the feed-splitting ratio and by adjusting the tower geometry (i. e., identity of the feed trays) for each trial. A typical example to be applied in a demethanizer tower is provided here to illustrate the effect of feed <b>splitting</b> on the <b>condenser</b> and reboiler duties...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new catalysts for normal alkanes isomerization reveals a big importance. Three series of catalysts were prepared by using sol-gel method, using different metal concentration and in two different pH (acid and basic). The first series contains molybdenum, the second contains tungsten and the third contains the two metals (molybdenum and tungsten). The catalysts were characterized by several techniques; the obtained {{results show that the}} catalysts prepared in basic pH have a surfaces areas and porous volumes higher than those prepared in acid pH. In order to evaluate the catalytic performances of prepared catalysts, we carried out the catalytic tests with light naphtha (C 5, C 6) isomerization. The obtained results show that the best conversions are obtained with catalysts prepared into pH basic. The octane numbers of the obtained products (isomerate) are high compared to naphtha. The addition of the obtained products (isomerate) into the pool gasoline allows on the one hand, to obtain gasolines with high octane numbers which respect the environmental standards, and on the other hand, the possibility of developing the light fractions (C 5 - C 6) resulting from the crude oil distillation unit and <b>condensed</b> <b>split</b> distillation...|$|R
40|$|Precise {{localization}} of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) -antibiotic complexes in a methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strain (BB 255), its isogenic heterogeneous methicillin-resistant transductant (BB 270), and {{a homogeneous}} methicillin-resistant strain (Col) was investigated by high-resolution electron microscopy. A mercury-penicillin V (Hg-pen V) derivative {{was used as}} a heavy metal-labeled, electron-dense probe for accurately localizing PBPs in situ in single bacterial cells during growth. The most striking feature of thin sections was the presence of an abnormally large (17 to 24 nm in width) splitting system within the thick cross walls or septa of Hg-pen V-treated bacteria of all strains. Untreated control cells possessed a thin, <b>condensed</b> <b>splitting</b> system, 7 to 9 nm in width. A thick splitting system was also distinguishable in unstained thin sections, thereby confirming that the electron contrast of this structure was not attributed to binding of bulky heavy metal stains usually used for electron microscopy. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that Hg-pen V bound to isolated plasma membranes as well as sodium dodecyl sulfate-treated cell walls and that two or more PBPs in each strain bound to this antibiotic. In contrast, the splitting system in penicillin V-treated bacteria was rarely visible after 30 min in the presence of antibiotic. These findings suggest that while most PBPs were associated with the plasma membrane, a proportion of PBPs were located within the fabric of the cell wall, in particular, in the splitting system. Inhibition of one or more high-M(r) PBPs by beta-lactam antibiotics modified the splitting system and cross-wall structure, therefore supporting a role for these PBPs in the synthesis and architectural design of these structures in S. aureus...|$|R
