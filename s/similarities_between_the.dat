5|$|Another {{strikingly similar}} portrait, {{depicting}} a woman also credited as Jane– although the costume differs slightly– was {{once owned by}} Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton, but is now in an undisclosed private collection. Owing to <b>similarities</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two works, Edwards suggests they are both copies of a lost original, perhaps completed by the same studio. A third copy, once owned by the English costume designer Herbert Norris, is known through records, although its whereabouts are unknown.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, a BBC Radio 4 {{documentary}} {{explored the}} possibility that the character of James Bond was created by 20th Century author and mentor to Fleming, Phyllis Bottome in her 1946 novel, The Lifeline.

5|$|In {{the western}} Italian Alps, the Alpine chough nests {{in a greater}} variety of sites than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes and {{abandoned}} buildings, whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere). The Alpine chough lays its eggs about one month later than its relative, although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The <b>similarities</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Lemuriform origins {{are unclear}} and debated.

Instead, lemuriforms may be descended from a very early branch of Asian cercamoniines or sivaladapids that migrated to northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Many reviewers {{identified}} an {{allusion to}} the Moors murders, committed by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, a British couple who killed children in the 1960s.

5|$|The Alpine chough lays its eggs {{about one}} month later than its relative, {{although}} breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The <b>similarities</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour. The first-year survival rate of the juvenile red-billed chough is 72.5 percent, and for the Alpine it is 77%. The annual adult survival rate is 83–92% for Alpine, but is unknown for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{brown creeper}} {{has never been}} {{recorded}} in Europe, but an autumn vagrant {{would be difficult to}} identify, since it would not be singing, and the American species' call is much like that of Eurasian treecreeper.
