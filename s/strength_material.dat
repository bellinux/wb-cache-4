25|$|Fly ash is {{also used}} as a {{component}} {{in the production of}} flowable fill (also called controlled low <b>strength</b> <b>material,</b> or CLSM), which is used as self-leveling, self-compact backfill material in lieu of compacted earth or granular fill. The strength of flowable fill mixes can range from 50 to 1,200 lbf/in² (0.3 to 8.3 MPa), depending on the design requirements of the project in question. Flowable fill includes mixtures of Portland cement and filler material, and can contain mineral admixtures. Fly ash can replace either the Portland cement or fine aggregate (in most cases, river sand) as a filler material. High fly ash content mixes contain nearly all fly ash, with a small percentage of Portland cement and enough water to make the mix flowable. Low fly ash content mixes contain a high percentage of filler material, and a low percentage of fly ash, Portland cement, and water. Class F fly ash is best suited for high fly ash content mixes, whereas Class C fly ash is almost always used in low fly ash content mixes.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between strength and strain in manufacturing controlled low <b>strength</b> <b>materials</b> to recycle incineration bottom ash. Laboratory tests for controlled low <b>strength</b> <b>materials</b> with bottom ash and recycled in-situ soil have been carried out. The optimum mixing ratios were 25 %– 45 % of in-situ soil, 30 % of bottom ash, 10 %– 20 % of fly ash, 0 %– 3 % of crumb rubber, 3 % of cement, and 22 % of water. Each mixture satisfied the standard specifications: a minimum 20 cm of flowability and 127 kPa of unconfined compressive strength. The average secant modulus (E 50) was (0. 07 – 0. 08) qu. The ranges of the internal friction angle and cohesion for mixtures were 36. 5 °– 46. 6 ° and 49. 1 – 180 kPa, respectively. The pH of all of the mixtures was over 12, which is strongly alkaline. Small-scale chamber tests for controlled low <b>strength</b> <b>materials</b> with bottom ash and recycled in-situ soil have been carried out. Vertical deflection of 0. 88 – 2. 41 mm and horizontal deflection of 0. 83 – 3. 72 mm were measured during backfilling.

50|$|In {{spite of}} the {{problems}} associated with the spray forming process there has been sustained industrial interest in spray forming over the last 35 years. Sandvik-Osprey (former Osprey Metals Ltd) of Neath, South Wales holds the patents on the process and have licensed the technology to a range of industries. There are currently approximately 25 licensees operating around the world, ranging from small research and development plants to full-scale commercial operations. Main applications are prematerial for low temperature Nb3Sn super conductors (CuSn), oil drilling equipment (high <b>strength</b> <b>material</b> CuMnNi) and for forming tools (CuAlFe with high Al-content). In all of these applications, research concerns the reconciliation of the cost disadvantages and complexity of spray forming with the demand for high performance alloys in niche applications.|$|E

50|$|Although {{most states}} have {{somewhat}} limited experience to date with flowable fill, nearly all {{states that have}} used the material have thus far indicated satisfactory performance {{with little or no}} problems. Several states have noted that metal or plastic pipes tend to float unless anchored, and some states have reported some resistance {{to the use of the}} material by contractors or engineers. Since flowable fill is normally a comparatively low-strength material, there are no strict quality requirements for fly ash used in flowable fill or controlled low <b>strength</b> <b>material</b> mixtures. Fly ash is well suited for use in flowable fill mixtures. Its fine particle sizing (nonplastic silt) and spherical particle shape enhances mix flowability. Its relatively low dry unit weight (usually in the 890 to 1300 kg/m3 (55 to 80 lb/ft3) range) assists in producing a relatively lightweight fill, and its pozzolanic or cementitious properties provide for lower cement requirements than would normally be required to achieve equivalent strengths.|$|E
