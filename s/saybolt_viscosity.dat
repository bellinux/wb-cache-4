40|$|Abstract. The present project {{explains}} how crude biodiesel (crude BD) has been obtained by using coconut oil and ethyl alcohol {{as well as}} sodium hydroxide as a catalyst. The coconut oil was extracted with water which was submitted to evaporation afterwards. This experiment {{was carried out by}} adding the coconut oil in a 500 mL glass flask. The catalyst was dissolved in ethyl alcohol and mixed together with the coconut oil. Once obtained the mixture, this was stirred for 25 minutes at temperatures from 20, 30, 40, 50 to 60 ºC. During the reaction, two phases were formed: crude biodiesel (top layer) and crude glycerol (bottom layer). The characterization was done by determination of pH (using an electrode located in the top layer connected to a computer by RS- 232 interface system). When the separation concluded, the crude BD was rinsed in order to remove the catalyst. The characterization of washed biodiesel was determined by density and <b>Saybolt</b> <b>viscosity.</b> Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis was also made. The results by FTIR indicated the two functional groups of fatty acid ethyl esters (C=O, 1733 cm- 1 and C-O, 1154 cm- 1) and the OH wide band group of glycerol at 3400 cm- 1. When the reaction time ended, the maximum pH value registered was 12. 7. The values for pH, density and <b>Saybolt</b> <b>viscosity</b> were acceptable for crude BD and crude glycerol...|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} the {{petroleum}} industry relied on measuring kinematic viscosity {{by means of the}} Saybolt viscometer, and expressing kinematic viscosity in units of Saybolt universal seconds (SUS). Other abbreviations such as SSU (Saybolt seconds universal) or SUV (<b>Saybolt</b> universal <b>viscosity)</b> are sometimes used. Kinematic viscosity in centistokes can be converted from SUS according to the arithmetic and the reference table provided in ASTM D 2161.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe synthesis, characterization, surface {{activity}} and applications of nonionic surfactants {{derived from the}} asphalt components (maltenes M) are presented. These compounds were synthesized by the sulfonation of (maltene), then the prepared maltene sulfonic acid (MS) was reacted with hexadecylamine giving maltene sulfonamide product (A) which undergoes an alkali-catalyzed ethoxylation at (135 – 150 °C). Several surfactants (M- 10 to M- 40) were formed with different ethylene oxide units (from 10 up to 40) and were characterized by molecular weight determinations, elemental analyses and FTIR analysis. Surface tension, {{as a function of}} concentration of the surfactants in the aqueous media, was measured at 25 °C. From these measurements, the critical micelle concentration (CMC), the maximum surface excess concentration (Гmax), Minimum area per molecule (Amin), effectiveness of surface reduction (ПCMC) and the efficiency (pC 20) were calculated. The prepared surfactants were applied as emulsifying agents for making asphalt emulsions. Storage stability, (<b>Saybolt</b> Furol) <b>viscosity,</b> settlement (water content difference %), coating ability and water resistance were measured. The results indicated that M- 20 (maltene sulfonamide ethoxylated with 20 units of ethylene oxides) gives a maximum stability...|$|R
40|$|When paving with {{bituminous}} mixtures in fields，they {{should be}} kept in the maximum temperature ranges， in which bitumen is not excessively degraded. 　　The purposes of heating bituminous materials are to improve the adhesive property of bitumen to aggregates and thereby to enhance the workability of the bituminous mixtures， because the lower viscosity of bituminous materials makes it wet well and adhere to the surfaces of the aggregate particles in a shorter time. In ASTM， the adequate viscosities are said to be obtained by the specified mixing and compaction times of 85 +_- 10 sec and 140 +_- 15 sec respectively. These are the working temperatures of the mixtures estimated from bitumen itself. An adequate working temperature， however，as it varies with many working conditions， cannot be determined simply by the viscosity of the working bitumen ； for example， the adequate working temperature varies with the kinds, quality and amounts of bitumen and finer {{as well as with the}} particle sizes of other aggregates. 　　Consequently，it became necessary to examine and determine the adequate mixing temperature of the bituminous mixture at which bitumen is not hardened unreasonably. Using the undersizes of filler 37 μm and 74 μm sieves and changing F/A from 0 to 2. 0 ，this study first carried out a series of <b>Saybolt</b> Furol <b>viscosity</b> tests and found out that the adequate mixing temperatures were 144 ℃ and 180 ℃, followed by Marshall tests to clarify the effects of bitumen in the mixture...|$|R
