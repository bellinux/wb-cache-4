40|$|The {{immune system}} {{normally}} protects the human host against death by infection. However, when an immune response is mistakenly directed at self antigens, autoimmune disease can occur. We describe {{a model of}} protein evolution to simulate {{the dynamics of the}} adaptive immune response to antigens.

Although a combination of gene segment <b>swapping</b> and <b>point</b> mutation can yield a greater affinity to a specific antigen than point mutation alone, the antibodies so evolved are highly cross-reactive and would cause autoimmune disease, and this is not the chosen dynamics of the immune system.

The adaption is performed locally using edge <b>swapping,</b> <b>point</b> insertion/deletion, and nodal displacements. Comparisons are made versus {{the current state of}} the art for aggressive anisotropic unstructured adaption, which is based on a posteriori error estimates. Demonstration of both schemes to model problems, with features representative of compressible gas dynamics, show the present method to be superior to the a posteriori adaption for linear advection. The performance of the two methods is more similar when applied to nonlinear advection, with a difference in the treatment of shocks. The a posteriori adaption can excessively cluster points to a shock, while the present multi-dimensional scheme tends to merely align with a shock, using fewer nodes. As a consequence of this alignment tendency, an implementation of eigenvalue limiting for the suppression of expansion shocks is developed for the multi-dimensional distribution scheme. The differences in the treatment of shocks by the adaption schemes, along with the inherently low levels of artificial dissipation in the fluctuation splitting solver, suggest the present method is a strong candidate for applications to compressible gas dynamics...|$|R

With a field-of-view of 54 x 54 arcmin, SWAP provides the widest-field images of the EUV corona available {{from the perspective of}} the Earth. By carefully processing and combining multiple SWAP images it is possible to produce low-noise composites that reveal the structure of the EUV corona to relatively large heights. A particularly important step in this processing was to remove instrumental stray light from the images by determining and deconvolving <b>SWAP's</b> <b>point</b> spread function (PSF) from the observations. In this paper we use the resulting images to conduct the first ever study of the evolution of the large-scale structure of the corona observed in the EUV over a three-year period that includes the complete rise phase of solar cycle 24. Of particular note is the persistence over many solar rotations of bright, diffuse features composed of open magnetic field that overlie polar crown filaments and extend to large heights above the solar surface. These features appear to be related to coronal fans, which have previously been observed in white-light coronagraph images and, at low heights, in the EUV. We also discuss the evolution of the corona at different heights above the solar surface and the evolution of the corona over the course of the solar cycle by hemisphere.

Monkey rotavirus SA 11 can use recombinant 41 as a cellular receptor. In this study a new potential 41, 47 and 91 integrin ligand sequence, Tyr-Gly-Leu, was identified in VP 4. It was shown that several human and monkey rotaviruses bound 41 and 47, but not 91. Binding to 41 mediated the infectivity {{and growth of}} monkey rotaviruses, and binding to 47 mediated their infectivity. A porcine rotavirus interacted with 4 integrins at a post-binding stage to facilitate infection. Activation of 41 increased rotavirus infectivity. Cellular treatment with peptides containing the 4 integrin ligand sequences Tyr-Gly-Leu and Ile-Asp-Ala eliminated virus binding to 4 integrins and infectivity. In contrast, rotavirus recognition of 4 integrins was unaffected by a peptide containing the sequence Leu-Asp-Val or by a mutation in the VP 7 Leu-Asp-Val sequence. VP 4 involvement in rotavirus recognition of 41 was demonstrated with rotavirus reassortants. <b>Swapping</b> and <b>point</b> mutagenesis of 4 surface loops showed that rotaviruses required the same 4 residues and domains for binding as the natural 4 integrin ligands: mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule- 1, fibronectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1.

40|$|A novel {{strategy}} {{to solve the}} finite volume discretization of the unsteady Euler equations within the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian framework over tetrahedral adaptive grids is proposed. The volume changes due to local mesh adaptation are treated as continuous deformations of the finite volumes and they {{are taken into account}} by adding fictitious numerical fluxes to the governing equation. This peculiar interpretation enables to avoid any explicit interpolation of the solution between different grids and to compute grid velocities so that the Geometric Conservation Law is automatically fulfilled also for connectivity changes. The solution on the new grid is obtained through standard ALE techniques, thus preserving the underlying scheme properties, such as conservativeness, stability and monotonicity. The adaptation procedure includes node insertion, node deletion, edge <b>swapping</b> and <b>points</b> relocation and it is exploited both to enhance grid quality after the boundary movement and to modify the grid spacing to increase solution accuracy. The presented approach is assessed by three-dimensional simulations of steady and unsteady flow fields. The capability of dealing with large boundary displacements is demonstrated by computing the flow around the translating infinite- and finite-span NACA 0012 wing moving through the domain at the flight speed. The proposed adaptive scheme is applied also to the simulation of a pitching infinite-span wing, where the bi-dimensional character of the flow is well reproduced despite the three-dimensional unstructured grid. Finally, the scheme is exploited in a piston-induced shock-tube problem to take into account simultaneously the large deformation of the domain and the shock wave. In all tests, mesh adaptation plays a crucial role...|$|R
40|$|Background: Genetic {{resistance}} {{is the most}} effective and sustainable approach to the control of plant pathogens that are a major constraint to agriculture worldwide. In soybean, three dominant R genes, i. e., Rsv 1, Rsv 3 and Rsv 4, have been identified and deployed against Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) with strain-specificities. Molecular identification of virulent determinants of SMV on these resistance genes will provide essential information for the proper utilization of these resistance genes to protect soybean against SMV, and advance knowledge of virus-host interactions in general. Methodology/Principal Findings: To study the gain and loss of SMV virulence on all the three resistance loci, SMV strains G 7 and two G 2 isolates L and LRB were used as parental viruses. SMV chimeras and mutants were created by partial genome <b>swapping</b> and <b>point</b> mutagenesis and then assessed for virulence on soybean cultivars PI 96983 (Rsv 1), L- 29 (Rsv 3), V 94 - 5152 (Rsv 4) and Williams 82 (rsv).

In addition, essential mutations in HC-Pro were also required for the gain of virulence on Rsv 1 -genotype soybean. To our best knowledge, this is the first report that CI and P 3 are involved in virulence on Rsv 1 - and Rsv 3 -mediated resistance, respectively.

We further demonstrate that RING fingers from the cellular genes mdm- 2 and Bmi I, when placed within IE 110 k, alter the nuclear distribution of IE 110 k, do not transactivate, and do not redistribute PML. We also demonstrate that the majority of wild-type IE 110 k, like PML, is associated with the nuclear matrix. Although substitutions and deletions within the RING finger abolish transactivation, these mutant proteins remain tightly associated with the matrix.
