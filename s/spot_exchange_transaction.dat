5000|$|A foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>spot</b> <b>transaction,</b> {{also known}} as FX spot, is an {{agreement}} between two parties to buy one currency against selling another currency at an agreed price for settlement on the <b>spot</b> date. The <b>exchange</b> {{rate at which the}} transaction is done is called the <b>spot</b> <b>exchange</b> rate. As of 2010, the average daily turnover of global FX spot transactions reached nearly 1.5 trillion USD, counting 37.4% of all foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>transactions.</b> [...] FX <b>spot</b> transactions increased by 38% to 2.0 trillion USD from April 2010 to April 2013.|$|R

50|$|A foreign {{exchange}} swap has two legs - a spot transaction and a forward transaction - that are executed simultaneously for the same quantity, and therefore offset each other.

As {{a result of the}} credibility of the peg, we expect that capital flows will respond to differentials between U.

5000|$|The {{tax would}} be levied on all {{transactions}} on financial instruments between financial institutions when {{at least one}} party to the transaction {{is located in the}} EU. It would cover 85% of the transactions between financial institutions (banks, investment firms, insurance companies, pension funds, hedge funds and others). House mortgages, bank loans to small and medium enterprises, contributions to insurance contracts, as well as <b>spot</b> currency <b>exchange</b> <b>transactions</b> and the raising of capital by enterprises or public bodies through the issuance of bonds and shares on the primary market would not be taxed, with the exception of trading bonds on secondary markets.Following the [...] "R plus I" [...] (residence plus issuance) solution an institution would pay the tax rate appropriate to the country of its residence, regardless of the location of the actual trade. In other words, the tax would cover all transactions that involve European firms, no matter whether these transactions take place within the EU or elsewhere in the world. If acting on behalf of a client, e.g., when acting as a broker, it would be able to pass on the tax to the client. Hence, it would be impossible for say French or German banks to avoid the tax by moving their transactions offshore.|$|R
40|$|During the intensifying {{integration}} of the global financial system experienced in recent years FX swap {{has become one of}} the most common financial products having the most liquid market. The scope of application of the FX swap transactions is extremely wide; they can be used for liquidity management, risk coverage, short-term yield speculation, and – combined with a <b>spot</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>transaction</b> – for taking exchange rate positions. In recent years the Hungarian banking system financed foreign currency lending mostly from forint funds. Domestic banks typically hedge the resulting on-balance sheet open foreign exchange position by using FX swap transactions concluded with non-residents. Accordingly – with the rise of foreign exchange lending in recent years – the net FX swap stock of the domestic banking system has increased significantly. The FX swap market played a key role during the financial turbulence in 2008, which prompted almost all central banks of the world to take fast and substantial measures. In the case of Hungary the disorder of the FX swap market represents significant risk for the operation of the banking system; thus in recent months the MNB has also taken several liquidity providing measures, due to which the functional disorder of the FX swap market has considerably decreased, simultaneously preserving the stability of the domestic banking system.

40|$|Based on {{evidence}} {{obtained from the}} IMF''s 2001 Survey on Foreign Exchange Market Organization, the author argues that, for several reasons, some central banks in developing and transition economies {{may be able to}} conduct foreign exchange intervention more effectively than the central banks of developed countries issuing the major international currencies. First, these central banks do not always fully sterilize their foreign exchange interventions. In addition, they issue regulations and conduct their foreign exchange operations in a way that increases the central bank''s information advantage and the size of their foreign exchange intervention relative to foreign exchange market turnover. Some of the central banks also use moral suasion to support their foreign exchange interventions.

40|$|Policymakers in many {{emerging}} markets {{are attempting to}} resist currency appreciation while simultaneously meeting targets for inflation. Using the recent experience of Colombia between 2004 and 2007, this paper examines {{the effectiveness of the}} Central Bank''s intervention in stemming domestic currency appreciation under an inflation targeting regime. The results indicate that exchange rate intervention was effective during 2004 - 2006, when foreign currency purchases were undertaken during a period of monetary easing. During 2007, on the other hand, intervention was ineffective in reversing or slowing down domestic currency appreciation, as large-scale intervention became incompatible with meeting the inflation target in an overheating economy. Currency derivative markets-which have grown in depth and sophistication-played a key role in blunting the effectiveness of intervention.

This is the first empirical study to focus on the limitations when modelling foreign <b>exchange</b> rate <b>transaction</b> exposure in emerging insurance markets. This work is based on the cash flow methodology proposed by Martin and Mauer (2003, 2005) in reference to banks, and employed by Li et al. (2009) when assessing US insurance companies. Some econometric methodological innovations have been introduced to study the limitations of modelling foreign <b>exchange</b> rate <b>transaction</b> exposure in emerging insurance markets. An extensive literature review is followed by a quantitative investigation, to answer the following research questions. 1) Is the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>transaction</b> exposure, as measured by a fundamental (economic) method of modelling the interplay of foreign exchange rates with other economic variables, significant, for all Egyptian insurance companies? 2) Is the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>transaction</b> exposure, as measured by a technical (statistical) way of modelling the interplay of foreign exchange rates with other economic variables, significant for all Egyptian insurance companies? 3) Is the <b>exchange</b> <b>transaction</b> exposure for the Egyptian insurance industry, as a whole, significant? Although the foreign <b>exchange</b> rate <b>transaction</b> exposure for the Egyptian insurance industry, as a whole, is insignificant (question 3), the percentage of Egyptian insurers affected by foreign <b>exchange</b> rate <b>transaction</b> exposure in US dollars, estimated at the individual firm level, was found to be 22...|$|R

40|$|Emerging markets {{business}} cycle models treat default risk {{as part of}} an exogenous interest rate on working capital, while sovereign default models treat income fluctuations as an exogenous endowment process with ad-noc default costs. We propose instead a general equilibrium model of both sovereign default and {{business cycle}}s.

The model explains several features of cyclical dynamics around default triggers an efficiency loss as these inputs are replaced by imperfect substitutes; and default on public and private obligations occurs simultaneously. The model explains several features of cyclical dynamics around deraults, countercyclical spreads, high debt ratios, and key business cycle moments.
