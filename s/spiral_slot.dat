40|$|Along {{with the}} current trend of {{wireless}} technology innovation, wideband, compact size, low-profile, lightweight and multiple functional antenna and array designs are becoming more attractive in many applications. Conventional wireless systems utilise omni-directional or sectored antenna systems. The disadvantage of such antenna systems is that the electromagnetic energy, required by a particular user located in a certain direction, is radiated unnecessarily in every direction within the entire cell, hence causing interference to other users in the system. In order to limit this source of interference and direct the energy to the desired user, smart antenna systems have been investigated and developed. This thesis presents the design, simulation, fabrication and full implementation of a novel smart antenna system for future mobile applications. The design and characterisation of a novel antenna structure and four-element liner array geometry for smart antenna systems are proposed {{in the first stage}} of this study. Firstly, a miniaturised microstrip-fed planar monopole antenna with Archimedean <b>spiral</b> <b>slots</b> to cover WiFi/Bluetooth and LTE mobile applications has been demonstrated. The fundamental structure of the proposed antenna element is a circular patch, which operates in high frequency range, for the purpose of miniaturising the circuit dimension. In order to achieve a multi-band performance, Archimedean <b>spiral</b> <b>slots,</b> acting as resonance paths, have been etched on the circular patch antenna. Different shapes of Archimedean <b>spiral</b> <b>slots</b> have been investigated and compared. The miniaturised and optimised antenna achieves a bandwidth of 2. 2 GHz to 2. 9 GHz covering WiFi/Bluetooth (2. 45 GHz) and LTE (2. 6 GHz) mobile standards. Then a four-element linear antenna array geometry utilising the planar monopole elements with Archimedean <b>spiral</b> <b>slots</b> has been described. All the relevant parameters have been studied and evaluated. Different phase shifts are excited for the array elements, and the main beam scanning range has been simulated and analysed. The second stage of the study presents several feeding network structures, which control the amplitude and phase excitations of the smart antenna elements. Research begins with the basic Wilkinson power divider configuration. Then this thesis presents a compact feeding network for circular antenna array, reconfigurable feeding networks for tuning the operating frequency and polarisations, a feeding network on high resistivity silicon (HRS), and an ultrawide-band (UWB) feeding network covering from 0. 5 GHz to 10 GHz. The UWB feeding network is used to establish the smart antenna array system. Different topologies of phase shifters are discussed in the third stage, including ferrite phase shifters and planar phase shifters using switched delay line and loaded transmission line technologies. Diodes, FETs, MMIC and MEMS are integrated into different configurations. Based on the comparison, a low loss and high accurate Hittite MMIC analogue phase shifter has been selected and fully evaluated for this implementation. For the purpose of impedance matching and field matching, compact and ultra wideband CPW-to-Microstrip transitions are utilised between the phase shifters, feeding network and antenna elements. Finally, the fully integrated smart antenna array achieves a 10 dB reflection coefficient from 2. 25 GHz to 2. 8 GHz, which covers WiFi/Bluetooth (2. 45 GHz) and LTE (2. 6 GHz) mobile applications. By appropriately controlling the voltage on the phase shifters, the main beam of the antenna array is steered ± 50 ° and ± 52 °, for 2. 45 GHz and 2. 6 GHz, respectively. Furthermore, the smart antenna array demonstrates a gain of 8. 5 dBi with 40 ° 3 dB bandwidth in broadside direction, and has more than 10 dB side lobe level suppression across the scan. The final stage of the study investigates hardware and software automatic control systems for the smart antenna array. Two microcontrollers PIC 18 F 4550 and LPC 1768 are utilised to build the control PCBs. Using the graphical user interfaces provided in this thesis, it is able to configure the beam steering of the smart antenna array, which allows the user to analyse and optimise the signal strength of the received WiFi signals around the mobile device.

Current clinical practice is to monitor ABCH with multiple, subsequent, conventional medical imaging. The radar technology introduced in this study could provide a lower cost and safe alternative to multiple conventional medical imaging monitoring for ACBH. The goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the feasibility of using radar to monitor changes in blood volume in the brain through a numerical simulation of ACBH monitoring from remote, with a directional <b>spiral</b> <b>slot</b> antennae, in 3 -D models of the brain. The focus of this study is on evaluating the effect of frequencies on the antennae reading. To that end we performed the calculations for frequencies of 100 MHz, 500 MHz and 1 GHz. The analysis shows that the ACBH can be monitored with radar and the monitoring resolution improves with an increase in frequency, in the range studied. However, it also appears that when typical clinical dimensions of hematoma and hemorrhage are used, the variable ratio of blood volume radius and radar wavelength can bring the measurements into the Mie and Rayleigh regions of the radar cross section. In these regions there is an oscillatory change in signal with blood volume size. For some frequencies there is an increase in signal with an increase in volume while in others there is a decrease. While radar can be used to monitor ACBH non-invasively and from a distance, the observed Mie region dependent oscillatory relation between blood volume size and wavelength requires further investigation.

The primary requirement of UWB antennas is be able to operate over frequencies released by the FCC. Moreover, the satisfaction of radiation properties and good time domain performance over the entire frequency range are also necessary. In this thesis, designing and analysing printed crescent shape monopole antenna, Planar Inverted F-L Antenna (PIFLA) and Planar Inverted FF Antenna (PIFFA) are focused. A Planar Inverted FF Antenna (PIFFA) can be created to reduce the potential for interference between a UWB system and other communications protocols by using <b>spiral</b> <b>slot.</b> The antennas exhibits broadside directional pattern. The performances such as return loss, radiation pattern and current distribution of the UWB antennas are extensively investigated and carried out.

In addition the miniaturization of MIMO/diversity Planar Inverted-F antenna (PIFA) which is suitable for pattern diversity in UWB applications is presented. This antenna assembly is formed by two identical PIFAs, a T-shaped decoupling structure which connects the two PIFAs and a finite ground plane with a total compact envelope dimension of 50 ¿ 90 ¿ 7. 5 mm 3.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} active integrated antennas {{in which}} the active devices are integrated to the feed line but {{very close to the}} radiating element. By integrating the active device very close to the antenna, feed line losses can be significantly reduced, the physical size of the whole system and manufacturing costs are reduced as well. Although such active integrated antennas have many potential applications in radar and wireless communications, they suffer from harmonic radiation which {{is a result of the}} nonlinear process in the active device. Unless suppressed, the harmonics of the operating frequency can easily leak into the antenna and cause severe harmonic radiation, and consequently, electromagnetic interference problems. To overcome this problem, additional filters are placed between the active device and the antenna. However, this approach increases the size and possibly increases the losses especially at high frequencies. Other approaches use electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structures and/or defected ground structures (DGSs).

The latter are used only at the aperture of the thin slot so that the nodes follow the center line of the slot. In this manner, regular size elements can be used regardless of the slot's width and any meshing restrictions are substantially relaxed.

This paper describes a spiral antenna on RT DUROID Substrate for the operating frequency range of 1. 2 - 1. 6 GHz These specifications should be satisfied at the frequency L 5 (1175 MHz). Array of spiral antennas {{can be used to}} increase the gain. Spiral antennas are reduced size antennas with its windings making it an extremely small structure. The antenna uses four spiral elements to provide broadband satellite coverage and can also be used in conjunction with a space-time adaptive processor (STAP) for interference suppression. This paper presents the input impedance, radiation pattern and gain...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{feasibility}} of using an L-band low gain antenna (LGA) as a mobile terminal antenna for helicopters is described. The objective is to select the lowest cost antenna system which can be easily mounted on a helicopter and capable of communicating with a geosynchronous satellite. To ensure that all the antenna options are being considered, the steerable high gain reflector and medium gain array antennas as well as LGA are studied and compared in an exhaustive survey. The high gain reflector antenna in L-band is usually very large in size and heavy in weight. In addition, a bulky and expensive tracking system is needed to steer the antenna beam to the satellite direction. The medium gain antennas (including mechanically and electronically steered arrays) are also more expensive and less reliable than an LGA due to {{the addition of a}} beam steering system to track the satellite. The omni-directional LGA is simple, reliable, and inexpensive. It is typically ten times smaller than the medium gain antenna. This makes the position, selection, and mounting on the helicopter relatively easier. Therefore, the LGA is selected as a mobile terminal antenna for helicopters. Among the many LGA's (cross-dipole, helix, <b>spiral,</b> and <b>slot</b> antennas), the helix antenna is the most inexpensive. One can also change the size, shape, or pitch angle of the helix to optimize the gain in the desired direction. Therefore, the helix antenna is selected for further study. Both 2 -arm and 4 -arm helices are studied theoretically and experimentally to determine the antenna's performance and the scattering effects from the helicopter body and the blades. The multipath, Doppler, and Doppler rate issues as well as the periodic fading effects caused by the helicopter rotor blades will be briefly discussed in the paper...|$|R
