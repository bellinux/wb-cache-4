Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of <b>self-dealing</b> was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by Duke University School of Law professor William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.|$|E
25|$|Emerson's {{addition}} of personal computers {{resulted in a}} $150 million loss for the company. That coupled with the recession that began in 1990 brought the company's total loss to $37.5 million in the last nine months of the year. Shares of stock fell as low as $2, compared to the high of $12.75 in 1987. Several shareholder lawsuits charged some Emerson directors and officials with breach of fiduciary duty and <b>self-dealing.</b> Emerson also fell into technical default on its long-term debt of $55.4 million {{at the end of}} the year. In 1988, Emerson Radio was sold to Panasonic.|$|E

The Sisters of Providence Health System (now Providence Health & Services) took over management of the facility in 1986. In 1993, the city owned hospital dealt with issues regarding administrator Mark Meinert who was accused by the city council of ethical violations concerning <b>self-dealing</b> involving his wife. The hospital was overseen by a city commission and still operated by the Sisters of Providence. Later in the year {{a member of the}} city council also accused the hospital’s administration with other ethics violations concerning travel and the use of public money.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessors, NBC {{frequently}} chooses {{games with}} a focus on about six teams: New York Rangers, Detroit Red Wings, Pittsburgh Penguins, Boston Bruins, and most recently the Washington Capitals and Chicago Blackhawks. The relation has very little correlation with team success; for instance, the Anaheim Ducks won the Stanley Cup in , and the Buffalo Sabres made it to the conference finals in both 2006 and 2007. Those teams received one and two potential games respectively in the 2008 season, compared to the seven potential games given to the Rangers and the four games which could include the rival Philadelphia Flyers. There also is significant emphasis on the Flyers; that franchise is a subsidiary of Spectacor, a majority-owned subsidiary of NBC parent company Comcast, making its favored status a conflict of interest (specifically <b>self-dealing),</b> especially since Comcast has become the exclusive national television broadcaster of the NHL in the United States. None of the other three major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada currently have any such conflict between their team owners and broadcasters, since they have at least two separate national broadcasters (Buffalo has fared better in its number of NBCSN appearances, {{due in part to the}} channel's relatively high viewership in the Buffalo market).|$|E
500|$|Keeping {{with the}} custom at the time, Hancock did not {{campaign}} personally, but stayed at his post at Fort Columbus on Governors Island, in New York Harbor {{and met with}} visitors there (as General Grant had in 1868, Hancock remained on active duty throughout the campaign). Both parties' campaigns began {{with a focus on}} the candidates rather than the issues. Democratic newspapers attacked the Republican nominee, James A. Garfield of Ohio, over rumors of corruption and <b>self-dealing</b> in the Crédit Mobilier affair, among others. Republicans characterized Hancock as uninformed on the issues, and some of his former comrades-in-arms gave critical speeches regarding his character. Democrats never made clear what about their victory would improve the nation; Hancock biographer David M. Jordan later characterized their message as simply [...] "our man is better than your man".|$|E
500|$|... of the United States Constitution {{therefore}} prohibits <b>self-dealing</b> {{legislation and}} {{is intended to}} protect the [...] "separation of power" [...] of the various branches of government. Corruption such as previously seen in the British Parliament was a consideration during debate by {{the framers of the}} Constitution. Legal scholars have accorded this clause little attention in their academic writings and there have been no cases which directly applied the clause, as no plaintiff has been able to establish legal standing. In fact, some general guides to Constitutional research, such as the clause-by-clause The Constitution of the United States: A Guide and Bibliography to Current Scholarly Research, do not discuss the Ineligibility clause. Most scholarly texts on the Constitution ignore the clause. Although the Saxbe fix is named for Nixon nominee William Saxbe, the device's first intentional use predates him by several decades. As a matter of historical tradition, the Saxbe fix is considered sufficient to remove the disqualification of the Ineligibility Clause.|$|E
500|$|In December 2013, Darabont and {{his agents}} from Creative Artists Agency (CAA) {{filed a lawsuit}} against AMC in a New York court, citing breach of contract. A central part of Darabont's lawsuit accuses AMC of denying him and the CAA the promised profits from the success of the series, based on how AMC had used {{vertical}} integration in producing and distributing The Walking Dead. As stated in Darabont's filing, he had initially entered into a contract with AMC to have a third-party studio produce the show, from which he would have obtained 12.5% of that entity's profits, after standard deductions. AMC wanted to produce the show in-house, and for the first season, Darabont's lawyers had been assured that Darabont would be protected from <b>self-dealing</b> fees by having AMC commit to imputed license fees equivalent to those of other independent studios, with Darabont earning profit from that. Darabont's suit contends that when the show's popularity took off, AMC presented a license fee deal to Darabont around February 2011 that used [...] "an unconscionably low license fee formula" [...] such that AMC could report the show running at a loss and ensuring that Darabont would never see any profit from the show; as an example, the suit references statements in 2012, following Season 2, that AMC claimed the show was running at a $49 million deficit, despite being {{one of the most popular}} shows in broadcast. Darabont's suit contends he was fired just at the start of the Season 2 so that AMC would avoid having to pay him.|$|E

2500|$|The Donald J. Trump Foundation is a New York-based private {{foundation}} founded and chaired by President of the United States Donald Trump.

2500|$|In 2013 the Trump Foundation made a $5,000 {{grant to}} the {{non-profit}} D.C. Preservation League. [...] According to The Washington Post, the nonprofit's support was {{helpful to the}} Trump Organization in obtaining the rights to convert Washington, D.C.'s historic Old Post Office Pavilion into the Trump International Hotel. In acknowledgment of the donation, the Trump Foundation received ads in the event programs; the ads promoted Trump's hotels rather than the foundation, in possible violation of IRS <b>self-dealing</b> rules.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Trump bid $12,000 at {{a charity}} auction, hosted at his Mar-a-lago club, to {{purchase}} an NFL football helmet autographed by Tim Tebow and a Tebow football jersey. Trump was given credit for generosity in newspaper accounts. However, the purchase was made with $12,000 of foundation money, not his own. The current whereabouts of the helmet and jersey are unknown. Tax law experts say if Trump kept them, the purchase might have violated the <b>self-dealing</b> rule, which bans private foundations from [...] "the furnishing of goods" [...] to their own officers.|$|E
2500|$|Krispy Kreme {{has been}} accused of channel {{stuffing}} by franchisees, whose stores reportedly [...] "received twice their regular shipments in the final weeks of a quarter so that headquarters could make its numbers". The company was also dogged by questionable transactions and <b>self-dealing</b> accusations over the buybacks of franchisees, including those operated by company insiders. A report released in August 2005 singled out then-CEO Scott Livengood and then-COO John W. Tate to blame for the accounting scandals although it did not find that the executives committed intentional fraud.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 2016 The Washington Post began {{reporting}} {{on how the}} foundation raised and granted money. The Post uncovered several potential legal and ethical violations, such as alleged <b>self-dealing</b> and possible tax evasion. The New York State Attorney General is investigating the foundation [...] "to {{make sure it is}} complying with the laws governing charities in New York." [...] A Trump spokesman called the investigation a [...] "partisan hit job". On October 3, 2016, the New York Attorney General's office notified the Trump Foundation that it was allegedly in violation of New York laws regarding charities, and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities [...] "in New York".|$|E

2500|$|Only {{two days}} later, however, Drexel lawyers {{found out about}} a limited {{partnership}} set up by Milken's department, MacPherson Partners, they previously hadn't known about. [...] This partnership {{had been involved in}} the issuing of bonds for Storer Broadcasting. [...] Several equity warrants were sold to one client who sold them back to Milken's department. [...] Milken then sold the warrants to MacPherson Partners. [...] The limited partners included several of Milken's children, and more ominously, managers of money funds. [...] This partnership raised the specter of <b>self-dealing,</b> and at worst, bribes to the money managers. [...] At the very least, this was a serious breach of Drexel's internal regulations. [...] Drexel immediately reported this partnership to Giuliani, and its revelation seriously hurt Milken's credibility with many at Drexel who believed in Milken's innocence—including Joseph and most of the board.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1970s, {{a number}} of issues arose which were to have {{significant}} influence on the course of the Society. The first was the tax structure in the UK: for a time, capital gains were taxed at up to 40 per cent (nil on gilts); earned income was taxed in the top bracket at 83 per cent, and investment income in the top bracket at 98 per cent. Lloyd's income counted as earned income, even for Names who did not work at Lloyd's, and this heavily influenced the direction of underwriting: in short, it was desirable for syndicates to make a (small) underwriting loss but a (larger) investment gain. The investment gain was typically achieved by [...] "bond washing" [...] or [...] "gilt stripping": selling the gilt or other bond cum dividend and buying it back ex dividend, thus forfeiting the interest income in exchange for a tax-free capital gain. Syndicate funds were also moved offshore (which later created problems through fraud and <b>self-dealing).</b>|$|E
2500|$|The federal {{legislation}} lacked adequate oversight and accountability. The two companies {{took advantage of}} these weaknesses in the legislation to manipulate the project and produce extra profit for themselves. Despite the generous subsidies offered by the federal government, the railroad capitalists knew they would not turn a profit on the railroad business for many months, possibly years. They determined {{to make a profit}} on the construction itself. Both groups of financiers formed independent companies to complete the project, and they controlled management of the new companies along with the railroad ventures. This <b>self-dealing</b> allowed them to build in generous profit margins paid out by the railroad companies. In the west, the four men heading the Central Pacific chose a simple name for their company, the [...] "Contract and Finance Company." [...] In the east, the Union Pacific selected an foreign name, calling their construction firm [...] "Crédit Mobilier of America." [...] The latter company was later implicated in a far-reaching scandal, described later.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2007, Trump spent $10,000 in Trump Foundation {{funds to}} {{purchase}} a -tall portrait of himself by artist Michael Israel at a benefit for a Florida charity, the , held at his Mar-a-Lago country club in Florida after his wife Melania Trump made the highest bid. [...] The painter's former production manager told The Washington Post that he had, {{at the request of}} Trump's wife Melania, shipped the painting to the Trump National Golf Club Westchester in Briarcliff Manor, New York, allegedly for display in the country club's boardroom or conference room. The charity paid half the proceeds, $10,000, to the artist for the painting, which established that the painting had a fair market value of at least that amount. [...] Tax experts told the Post that if it was displayed at the golf club, it could violate Internal Revenue Service rules prohibiting non-profits from <b>self-dealing</b> (i.e., using charitable funding for noncharitable purposes). In September 2016, President Barack Obama publicly criticized Trump's purchase of the painting.|$|E
2500|$|The key to Reis's {{plan was}} that only {{he knew that}} the {{contract}} was forged; trading on the period's widespread cynicism about the monetary policies of governments and on Portugal's reputation for corruption and <b>self-dealing,</b> he convinced the others who assisted in his operation that what they were doing had the clandestine support of the Bank. [...] Reis' key associates, Dutch trader Karel Marang van IJsselveere, German trader Adolph Hennies, and José Bandeira (brother of António Bandeira, the Portuguese Ambassador to the Netherlands) later claimed to have believed the project was legitimate throughout. [...] Reis had been lucky or fortunate in his selection of associates; although currently legitimate, each man had checkered pasts and had no objections to engaging in an enterprise that was technically legal even if shady, especially if it involved such major insiders. [...] Reis alone knew unquestionably that there were no insiders and his various documents worthless, though prosecutors and journalists later suggested that the continuing credulity of his associates as the scheme progressed strained belief.|$|E
2500|$|Only a day later, however, Drexel lawyers {{discovered}} suspicious {{activity in}} one of the limited partnerships Milken set up to allow members of his department to make their own investments. [...] That entity, MacPherson Partners, had acquired several warrants for the stock of Storer Broadcasting in 1985. [...] At the time, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts {{was in the midst of}} a leveraged buyout of Storer, and Drexel was lead underwriter for the bonds being issued. [...] One of Drexel's other clients bought several Storer warrants and sold them back to the high-yield bond department. [...] The department in turn sold them to MacPherson. [...] This partnership included Milken, other Drexel executives, and a few Drexel customers. [...] However, it also included several managers of money market funds who had worked with Milken in the past. [...] It appeared that the money managers bought the warrants for themselves and didn't offer the same opportunity to the funds they managed. [...] Some of Milken's children also got warrants, according to Stewart, raising the appearance of Milken <b>self-dealing.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Trump's {{foundation}} paid $158,000 to the Martin B. Greenberg Foundation as {{a settlement}} of a lawsuit brought by Greenberg against the Trump National Golf Club Westchester in Briarcliff Manor, New York. Greenberg alleged that he had rightfully won a $1 million prize for scoring a hole-in-one in a 2010 charity golf tournament at the club. [...] But the club denied the award on technical grounds, arguing that the hole was shorter than the required 150 yards. Martin Greenberg sued and a settlement was reached at a significantly reduced amount. The Washington Post reported that [...] "on the day that Trump and the other parties told the court that they had settled the case, the Donald J. Trump Foundation made its first and only grant to the Martin B. Greenberg Foundation, for $158,000." [...] In September 2016, the Post reported that the grant was directly linked to the legal settlement, likely violating IRS <b>self-dealing</b> rules by using charitable funds to pay Trump's personal or business obligations. To raise the money {{needed to make the}} settlement, the Trump Foundation auctioned a prize of lifetime golf membership at Trump-owned golf courses, with the winning bid bringing a $157,000 donation to the Trump Foundation to the foundation to offset the payment to the Greenberg Foundation. The winner of the auction may have believed he was donating to Trump Foundation charitable causes.|$|E
2500|$|Five main {{rights for}} {{beneficiaries}} in ERISA 1974 include information, funding, vesting, anti-discrimination, and fiduciary duties. First, each beneficiary should receive a [...] "summary plan description" [...] in 90 days of joining, plans must file annual reports with the Secretary of Labor, and if beneficiaries make claims any refusal must be justified with a [...] "full and fair review". If the [...] "summary plan description" [...] is more beneficial {{than the actual}} plan documents, because the pension fund makes a mistake, a beneficiary may enforce the terms of either. If an employer has pension or other plans, all employees must be entitled to participate after at longest 12 months, if working over 1000 hours. Second, all promises must be funded in advance. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation was established {{by the federal government}} to be an insurer of last resort, but only up to $60,136 per year for each employer. Third, employees' benefits usually cannot be taken away (they [...] "vest") after 5 years, and contributions must accrue (i.e. the employee owns contributions) at a proportionate rate. If employers and pension funds merge, there can be no reduction in benefits, and if an employee goes bankrupt their creditors cannot take their occupational pension. However, the US Supreme Court has enabled benefits to be withdrawn by employers simply amending plans. In Lockheed Corp v Spink a majority of seven judges held that an employer could alter a plan, to deprive a 61-year-old man of full benefits when he was reemployed, unbound by fiduciary duties to preserve what an employee had originally been promised. In dissent, Breyer J and Souter J reserved any view on such [...] "highly technical, important matters". Steps to terminate a plan depend on whether it is individual, or multi-employer, and Mead Corp v Tilley a majority of the US Supreme Court held that employers could recoup excess benefits paid into pension plans after PBGC conditions are fulfilled. Stevens J, dissenting, contended that all contingent and future liabilities must be satisfied. Fourth, as a general principle, employees or beneficiaries cannot suffer any discrimination or detriment for [...] "the attainment of any right" [...] under a plan. Fifth, managers are bound by responsibilities of competence and loyalty, called [...] "fiduciary duties". Under §1102, a fiduciary is anyone who administers a plan, its trustees, and investment managers who are delegated control. Under §1104, fiduciaries must follow a [...] "prudent" [...] person standard, involving three main components. First, a fiduciary must act [...] "in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan". Second, they must act with [...] "care, skill and diligence", including [...] "diversifying the investments of the plan" [...] to [...] "minimize the risk of large losses". Liability for carelessness extends to making misleading statements about benefits, and have been interpreted by the Department of Labor to involve a duty to vote on proxies when corporate stocks are purchased, and publicizing a statement of investment policy. Third, and codifying fundamental equitable principles, a fiduciary must avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest. He or she must act [...] "solely {{in the interest of the}} participants... for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits" [...] with [...] "reasonable expenses", and specifically avoiding <b>self-dealing</b> with a related [...] "party in interest". For example, in Donovan v Bierwirth, the Second Circuit held that trustees of a pension which owned shares in the employees' company as a takeover bid was launched, because they faced a potential conflict of interest, had to get independent legal advice on how to vote, or possibly abstain. Remedies for these duties have, however, been restricted by the Supreme Court to disfavor damages. In these fields, according to §1144, ERISA 1974 will [...] "supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan". ERISA did not, therefore, follow the model of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 or the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which encourage states to legislate for improved protection for employees, beyond the minimum. The preemption rule led the US Supreme Court to strike down a New York that required giving benefits to pregnant employees in ERISA plans. It held a case under Texas law for damages for denying vesting of benefits was preempted, so the claimant only had ERISA remedies. It struck down a Washington law which altered who would receive life insurance designation on death. However, under §1144(b)(2)(A) this does not affect 'any law of any State which regulates insurance, banking, or securities.' So, the Supreme Court has also held valid a Massachusetts law requiring mental health to be covered by employer group health policies. But it struck down a Pennsylvania statute which prohibited employers becoming subrogated to (potentially more valuable) claims of employees for insurance after accidents. Yet more recently, the court has shown a greater willingness to prevent laws being preempted, however the courts have not yet adopted the principle that state law is not preempted or [...] "superseded" [...] if it is more protective to employees than a federal minimum.|$|E
50|$|<b>Self-dealing</b> is {{the conduct}} of a trustee, an attorney, a {{corporate}} officer, or other fiduciary that consists of taking advantage of his position in a transaction and acting for his own interests rather than for {{the interests of the}} beneficiaries of the trust, corporate shareholders, or his clients. <b>Self-dealing</b> may involve misappropriation or usurpation of corporate assets or opportunities. <b>Self-dealing</b> is a form of conflict of interest.|$|E
