5|$|Nier defeats the pair, with Emil sacrificing {{himself to}} ensure his friends' progress. The {{remaining}} group then defeats the Shadowlord. It is {{revealed that the}} Shadowlord's true identity is the Gestalt form of the Nier from the prologue; the Nier the player has been controlling {{for the majority of}} the game is his Replicant. Driven to protect his Yonah, he was the first Gestalt and has combined her with the Replicant Yonah. The original Yonah, however, tells the Gestalt Nier that <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> the new Yonah inside her, and that she loves the Replicant Nier and deserves the body just as much. She vacates the body, and Nier and Yonah are reunited.|$|E

2500|$|In {{interview}} with People, she revealed she draws her musical inspirations from humming a melody off the note of a whirring fan or tapping her {{foot to the}} rhythm of the bathtub dripping; stating <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> melodies from natural sounds like birds chirping or the taxis and construction in Manhattan. Occasionally, however, Harrison wishes she could stop the music. [...] "In the middle of a conversation, I'll start humming or moving my feet, and my friends will say, 'You can't be serious, she says. [...] "It's such a reflex that I'm totally unaware I look like an idiot." [...] Most of her songs are helmed from personal experiences in her life as well as friends' experiences.|$|E

60|$|While we {{were talking}} an old man--older and more bent and {{wrinkled}} even than the woman--appeared from behind the shanty. 'Here is Pierre,' said <b>she.</b> 'M'sieur <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> stories now if he wishes, for Pierre was in everything, from the Bastille to Waterloo.' The old man took another stool at my request and we plunged into a sea of revolutionary reminiscences. This old man, albeit clothed like a scarecrow, was like {{any one of the}} six veterans.|$|R

60|$|It is {{long before}} Miss Tox goes away, and before Polly, with a candle flaring on the blank stairs, looks after her, for company, down the street, and feels unwilling {{to go back}} into the dreary house, and jar its {{emptiness}} with the heavy fastenings of the door, and glide away to bed. But all this Polly does; and in the morning sets in one of those darkened rooms such matters as she has been advised to prepare, and then retires and enters them no more until next morning at the same hour. There are bells there, but they never ring; and though <b>she</b> <b>can</b> sometimes <b>hear</b> a footfall going to and fro, it never comes out.|$|R

6000|$|... "What!" [...] exclaimed Roberta, {{in a tone}} {{which made}} Annie lift up her hands and implore her not to speak so loud, for fear that her aunt should hear her.

If not in another room, why, when Hector is in the room talking to Paris, does Helen ask him to [...] "come in"? (Iliad, VI. 354).
