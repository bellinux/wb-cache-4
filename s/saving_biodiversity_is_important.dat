The flow of funds to international biodiversity conservation appears trivial when compared to the scale of biodiversity loss. International agreements may not actually protect or conserve more than what would have been conserved anyway. Protected Areas may be ‘paper parks’, protected in name but not in practice. The very act of protection may contain self-destructive features because local communities can easily suffer loss of income and assets, making them unwilling partners in the act of protection. In turn, this places the protected area at risk and may also divert unsustainable harvesting activities to non-protected but equally diverse ecosystems. In tackling these issues the real <b>biodiversity</b> challenge <b>is</b> redesigning conservation effort, making it truly additional and making it compatible with poverty reduction. ...|$|R

40|$|Extract] Well-documented {{differences}} between marine and terrestrial environments [1] {{have resulted in}} limited interaction between ecologists working {{in each of these}} realms [2], which has reduced our capacity to address shared research priorities such as predicting effects of climate change on biodiversity. Efforts to model impacts of climate change on compositional <b>biodiversity</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> for planning ameliorative conservation and management actions [3], yet have occurred largely independently in marine and terrestrial environments [4]. Through a workshop aimed at identifying the main {{differences between}} marine and terrestrial biodiversity modelling, we found a surprising number of commonalities, with many key challenges and their solutions being shared between realms. Acknowledging these commonalities and developing a more collaborative approach will improve predictions of climate change impacts on biodiversity, by ensuring application of the most appropriate modelling approaches and use of 'best-practice' methods, regardless of the environment being modelled. Here, we build on broader calls for greater marine–terrestrial interaction [2] by describing specific benefits and mechanisms for achieving them...|$|R
40|$|Tropical {{forests are}} the most diverse {{terrestrial}} ecosystems. Moreover, their capacity for removal of carbon from the atmosphere makes them important for climate change mitigation. Theories predict that species use resources in a different way, and therefore high species diversity would result in more efficient resource use and higher total carbon removal. These theories, however, have yet not been clearly demonstrated for tropical forests. In this thesis, I evaluated how biodiversity of plants and their traits influenced carbon removal. I used data collected in different tropical forest types and at different spatial and temporal scales. I found that <b>biodiversity</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> for carbon removal especially at large spatial scales (e. g. the Amazon) where biodiversity varies strongly, and at long temporal scales (e. g. > 200 years) where high biodiversity functions as a buffer for changing environmental conditions.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 This {{research}} analyzes how family forest owners conceptualize biodiversity in one high-conservation value area of oak woodland in the Willamette Valley of Western Oregon.

Much of the oak ecotype occurs on the lands of family forest owners. Understanding owners' conceptions of <b>biodiversity</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for the conservation of this important resource. Theories from sociology, social psychology, and policy analysis argue that information about people's knowledge and beliefs <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for understanding and influencing their behavior. This research explores the mental and biophysical terrains of owners' relationships with biodiversity. Through interdisciplinary methods - including concept mapping, in-depth interviews, property mapping and field reconnaissance - it explores the meanings that people give to biodiversity on their family properties. Findings indicate that 1) owners are knowledgeable about the key elements of biodiversity, and 2) their use of this knowledge in management reflects their beliefs about human relationships with nature and external market constraints...|$|R

Orius insidiosus Say (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) <b>is</b> an <b>important</b> predator of thrips and aphids that also feeds on plants. It is the target of conservation biological control programs. Despite O. insidiosus’ relevance, {{little is known about}} the effects of plant subsidies on predator performance or nutritional status. Here, we examined the influence of restricting the pollen and nectar resources of five plant species (alyssum, buckwheat, phacelia, fava bean, and chamomile), and how increasing plant diversity affects O. insidiosus fecundity, survival, and nutritional status. Plant species varied in their suitability for O. insidiosus, which was driven in part by the availability of the pollen or nectar resources. Offering plants as a mixture did not improve fecundity; however, the plant least preferred for oviposition under no-choice tests (fava bean) became the preferred egg-laying site when the plants were offered in combination. We conclude that the benefits obtained by O. insidiosus vary among plant species, and that increasing plant diversity can have unpredicted, positive effects on insect fitness...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how {{disturbance}} affects <b>biodiversity</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> {{for both}} fundamental and applied reasons. Here, I investigate how disturbances with different ecological effects change biodiversity metrics. I define three main types of disturbance effects: D disturbance (shifts in mortality rate), B disturbance (shifts in reproductive rates) and K disturbance (shifts in carrying capacity). Numerous composite disturbances {{can be defined}} including any combination of these three types of ecological effects. The consequences of D, B and K disturbances, {{as well as of}} composite DBK disturbances are examined by comparing metrics before and after a disturbance, in disturbed and undisturbed communities. I use simulations of neutral communities and examine species richness, total abundance and species abundance distributions. The patterns of change in <b>biodiversity</b> metrics <b>are</b> consistent among different types of disturbance. K disturbance has the most severe effects, followed by D disturbance, and B disturbance has nearly negligible effects. Consequences of composite DBK disturbances are more complex than any of the three types of disturbance, with unimodal relationships along a disturbance gradient arising when D, B and K are negatively correlated. Importantly, regardless of disturbance type, community isolation enhances the negative consequences and hinders the positive effects of disturbances...|$|R
40|$|Partie IIIThe {{study of}} the {{relationships}} between agriculture and <b>biodiversity</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to sustain <b>biodiversity</b> for the future. The landscape level has an influence, which has been until now mainly related to the importance of semi-natural elements. But in agricultural areas crop land is often dominant and acts on biodiversity by the resources it provides and the effects of disturbances induced by agricultural practices. The mosaic of crops is ephemeral and highly dynamic in space and time according to farming practices and crop rotations. The aim of this chapter is to assess the role of agricultural landscape heterogeneity on biodiversity. Landscape heterogeneity may be measured from different perspectives, considering non-cropped areas versus crop ones, or taking into consideration the dynamics of the mosaic of crops and agricultural practices. From studies on a long term ecological research site in Brittany, France, we present how these different approaches of landscape heterogeneity allow {{a better understanding of the}} diversity of processes driving biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.

40|$|In {{our recent}} {{perspective}} article, {{we noted that}} most (approximately 60 percent) terrestrial large carnivore and large herbivore species are now threatened with extinction, and we offered a 13 -point declaration designed to promote and guide actions to save these iconic mammalian megafauna (Ripple et al. 2016). Some may worry that a focus on saving megafauna might undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity more broadly. We believe that all dimensions of <b>biodiversity</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> and that efforts to conserve megafauna are not in themselves sufficient to halt the dispiriting trends of species and population losses in recent decades. From 1970 to 2012, a recent global analysis showed a 58 percent overall decline in vertebrate population abundance (WWF 2016). Bold and varied approaches are necessary to conserve what remains of Earth’s biodiversity, and our declaration in no way disputes the value of specific conservation initiatives targeting other taxa. Indeed, the evidence is clear that without massively scaling up conservation efforts for all species, we will fail to achieve internationally agreed-upon targets for biodiversity...|$|R

We described and analyzed local-scale spatial patterns of collecting records of wasp species, as well as spatial variation of diversity descriptors in a 2500 -hectare area of an Amazon forest in Brazil. Rare species comprised the largest fraction of the fauna. Close range spatial effects were detected {{for most of the}} more common species, with clustering of presence-data at short distances. Larger spatial lag effects could also be identified in some species, constituting probably cases of exogenous autocorrelation and candidates for explanations based on environmental factors. In a few cases, significant or near significant correlations were found between five species (of Agelaia, Angiopolybia, and Mischocyttarus) and three studied environmental variables: distance to nearest stream, terrain altitude, and the type of forest canopy. However, association between these factors and <b>biodiversity</b> variables <b>were</b> generally low. When used as predictors of polistine richness in a linear multiple regression, only the coefficient for the forest canopy variable resulted significant.

40|$|<b>Biodiversity</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> in {{maintaining}} ecosystem viability, {{and the availability}} of adequate <b>biodiversity</b> data <b>is</b> a prerequisite for the sustainable management of natural resources. As such, there is a clear need to map biodiversity at high spatial resolutions across large areas. Airborne and spaceborne optical remote sensing is a potential tool to provide such biodiversity data. The spectral variation hypothesis (SVH) predicts a positive correlation between spectral variability (SV) of a remotely sensed image and biodiversity. The SVH has only been tested on a few terrestrial plant communities. Our study is the first attempt to apply the SVH in the marine environment using hyperspectral imagery recorded by Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). All coverage-based diversity measures of benthic macrophytes and invertebrates showed low but statistically significant positive correlations with SV whereas the relationship between biomass-based diversity measures and SV were weak or lacking. The observed relationships did not vary with spatial scale. SV had the highest independent effect among predictor variables in the statistical models of coverage-derived total benthic species richness and Shannon index. Thus, the relevance of SVH in marine benthic habitats was proved and this forms a prerequisite for the future use of SV in benthic biodiversity assessments...|$|R
