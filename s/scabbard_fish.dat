50|$|The black {{scabbardfish}} is a suitable host for the parasite Anisakis. This is mainly {{due to the}} fishes’ diet of infected hosts such as crustaceans (euphausiids, copepods and amphipods), fish and cephalopods. This parasite is a nematode {{that is capable of}} entering the hosts stomach wall or intestines. Scientists can and have used these parasites to track where the {{black scabbardfish}} has traveled. The parasite Anisakis is commonly used for tracking since they are prevalent in waters nearby Portugal and the Madeira Islands. A study has been conducted on the infectivity of the Anisakis app. Larvae (Nematoda: Aniskidae) in the black scabbardfish near Portuguese waters. The three regions that were observed in the study was the mainland coast of Portugal, Madeira, and Azores. The mainland and Madeira regions were observed throughout four seasons by scientists and the Azores was observed in two seasons. In all fish observed all were infected by Anisakis L3 larvae. Consumption of raw or under cooked black <b>scabbard</b> <b>fish</b> can result in health complications for humans. The only reliable treatment for a human affected with Anisakiasis is the removal of the nematodes through endoscopy, or surgery.|$|E
50|$|The black {{scabbardfish}} is of economic importance to fisheries associated with {{countries of the}} Iberian Peninsula, and especially with the Madeira Islands where they are prized for food. The {{black scabbardfish}} is also fished around areas of Iceland, France, Ireland and around some areas around the Canary Islands. Because of its good flesh quality, it usually fetches high prices. The black scabbardfish fish, along with the crab {{are the two most}} sought after sea products for consumption in the Madeira Islands and Portugal and therefore play a huge economic role in these locations. In areas in Portuguese waters the black scabbardfish has traditionally been caught by line gears. In the NE Atlantic around the areas of France and Ireland the fish are caught by trawlers. The black scabbardfish, has high economic value in areas such as Portugal, it is the most important deep-water fish exploited, and landings of the black scabbardfish increased from 2700 tonnes per year between the years of 1988 and 1993 and around the year of 2000 and increased to 2900 tonnes in landings obtained in the year of 2007. In the last decade alone landings of the black <b>scabbard</b> <b>fish</b> have increased to about 6000 tonnes, 3000 tonnes in Madeira and 3000 tonnes in mainland Portugal.|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe black <b>scabbard</b> <b>fish</b> {{is greatly}} {{appreciated}} by the Portuguese population. However, it has generally {{high levels of}} mercury (Hg). The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the bioaccessibility of mercury in this species subjected to different culinary treatments (fried, grilled and steamed). The content of Hg and the proximate chemical composition were quantified in raw and cooked samples and the samples were also subjected to simulated digestive tract. The results revealed that the culinary treatments affected the chemical composition of black <b>scabbard</b> <b>fish</b> due to water loss and consequent concentration of other nutrients. All biometric parameters analyzed did not influence the Hg content. However, for culinary treatments, grilled fish showed higher levels of Hg, with 80 % of samples above the limit set by the EU. The values of provisional tolerable weekly intake showed that fried, boiled and steamed black <b>scabbard</b> <b>fish</b> should be moderately eaten by pregnant women and children as they are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of Hg. A higher Hg bioaccessibility was observed in raw fish samples compared to cooked samples. Intestine was the digestion step where bioaccessible Hg reached the highest levels for absorption. The results indicate that frying cooking induce lower Hg bioacessibility, thus representing a lower risk for consumers...|$|E
40|$|Regular {{consumption}} of seafood {{has been widely}} recommended by authorities. Yet, some species accumulate high levels of contaminants like Hg, Cd and As. In addition, the risks associated to the {{consumption of}} such seafood may increase if consumers use cooking practices that enhance the concentration of contaminants and their bioaccessibility. In this study, the bioaccessibility of Hg, Cd and As was assessed with in vitro human digestion of raw and cooked black <b>scabbard</b> <b>fish</b> (Hg; steamed, fried and grilled) and edible crab (Cd and As; steamed and boiled) tissues. Additionally, the toxicological hazards associated with the consumption of these products were also discussed. Generally, Hg, Cd and As bioacessibility increased throughout the digestion process. Cadmium and As revealed high bioaccessibility rates in raw and cooked samples (up to 100 %), whereas lower bioaccessible fractions of Hg was observed (up to 40 %). Furthermore, this study pointed out the importance of food matrix, elemental chemical properties and cooking practices in the bioaccessibility of Hg, Cd and As. The toxicological hazards revealed that edible crab brown meat (Cd) and grilled black <b>scabbard</b> <b>fish</b> (MeHg) consumption in children should be moderated. In contrast, edible crab muscle (Cd) and fried or steamed black <b>scabbard</b> <b>fish</b> (MeHg) should be consumed to minimize exposure. The use of bioaccessible contaminant data strongly reduced the toxicological risks of MeHg, whereas less risk reduction occurred with Cd and inorganic As. Fundação para a ciência e tecnologi...|$|E
40|$|Aphanopus carbo, black scabbardfish, {{specimens}} from 3 Portuguese regions (the mainland, Madeira and the Azores) during four (mainland and Madeira) or two (Azores) {{seasons of}} the year were examined {{for the presence of}} Anisakis. All the fish examined (n= 287) were infected with Anisakis L 3 larvae (prevalence = 100 %). Significant geographical differences in intensity were found: the Azores showed the lowest mean intensity value (53. 7) and Madeira the highest one (253. 9). The intensity of infection was positively correlated with the host length in specimens of Sesimbra and Madeira. Significant seasonal differences in intensity were found in the studied regions. The very high values in prevalence and intensity strongly suggest that the consumption of raw or undercooked black <b>scabbard</b> <b>fish</b> is a potential risk for human health...|$|E
40|$|Investigations and fishery on {{deep water}} fish {{at the eastern}} area of the Sargasso Sea on the Corner Rising seamounts (34 – 37 °N, 47 – 53 °W) in NAFO Subarea 6 have been {{conducted}} by the Soviet Union/Russia since 1976. The total catch taken during the period amount to more than 19 000 tons. The most important species of this fishery was Alfonsino (Beryx splendens). Besides Alfonsino, black <b>scabbard</b> <b>fish</b> (Aphanopus carbo), wreckfish (Polyprion americanus), barrelfish (Hyperoglyphe perciforma), cardinal fish (Epigonus telescopus) and f l int-perch (Hoplostethus mediterraneus) were also of commercial importance on the Corner Rising. Biological observations on the main species, including spawning and feeding habits, distribution and formation of deepwater aggregation, and hydrographic conditions are described. Noting the limited stock sizes observed during this long-term study, an international management of the fisheries is advised...|$|E
40|$|Total mercury, cadmium {{and lead}} {{concentrations}} were measured in black <b>scabbard</b> <b>fish</b> (Aphanopus carbo), caught off Madeira and the Azores archipelagos (Portugal). The metal contents were expressed in mg kg(- 1) wet weight. The mean mercury levels in liver were 4. 50 and 2. 37 whereas, in skin, such values were 0. 59 and 0. 36 (Madeira and Azores, respectively). Onaverage, the muscle content was around 0. 9 in fish from both areas. Cadmium maximum levels in muscle and skin were found in Azores samples (0. 09 and 0. 11, respectively). Mean lead contents in all samples were always below than 0. 10. In general, the results obtained did not allow the establishment of any relationship between metal accumulation and fish weight or length. According to the permissible WHO and FAO levels, these results, suggest that this species does not represent a risk for human consumption if the liver is excluded and the edible part consumed with moderation.

40|$|The deep-sea {{environment}} is a sink {{for a wide}} variety of contaminants including heavy metals and organic compounds of anthropogenic origin. Life history traits of many deep-water fish species including longevity and high trophic position may predispose them to contaminant exposure and subsequent induction of pathological changes, including tumour formation. The lack of evidence for this hypothesis prompted this investigation in order to provide data on the presence of pathological changes in the liver and gonads of several deep-water fish species. Fish were obtained from the north east region of the Bay of Biscay (north east Atlantic Ocean) by trawling at depths between 700 to 1400 m. Liver and gonad samples were collected on board ship and fixed for histological processing and subsequent examination by light microscopy. Hepatocellular and nuclear pleomorphism and individual cases of ovotestis and foci of cellular alteration (FCA) were detected in black <b>scabbard</b> <b>fish</b> (Aphanopus carbo). Six cases of FCA were observed in orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) (n= 50) together with a single case of hepatocellular adenoma. A wide variety of inflammatory and degenerative lesions were found in all species examined. Deep-water fish display a range of pathologies similar to those seen in shelf-sea species used for international monitoring programmes including biological effects of contaminants. This study has confirmed the utility of health screening in deep-water fish for detecting evidence of prior exposure to contaminants and has also gained evidence of pathology potentially associated with exposure to algal toxins...|$|E
40|$|A 2 -year {{study of}} the European hake (Merluccius merluccius) semi-pelagic ("pedra-bola) {{longline}} fishery {{was carried out in}} the Algarve (southern Portugal). This fishery takes place on the continental slope at 200 - 700 m depths. using monofilament longlines that are lifted off the bottom at regular intervals by glass balls. Hook selectivity trials were carried out with four hook sizes (SIAPAL brand numbers 10, 9, 7 and 5) from March to August 1997 and May to August 1998. At least 32 species of fish and invertebrates were caught, with hake dominating the catch (41 and 45 % of the catch in numbers), followed by Galeus melastomus (23 and 19 %), Micromesistius poutassou (10 and 7 %), Benthodesmus elongatus (8 and 5 %), Etmopterus pusillus (6 and 9 %) and Scyliorhinus canicula (5 and 4 %). Apart from the hake, and some species of commercial value such as G. melastomus (only the large individuals), Ray's bream (Brama brama, 1. 4 and 4 %), silver <b>scabbard</b> <b>fish</b> (Lepidopus caudatus. 1 and 2. 5 %), swordfish (Xiphins gladius, < 1 %), wreckfish (Polyprion americanus, < 1 %). conger eel (Conger conger. < 1 %), and bluemouth rockfish (Helicolenus dactylopterus, < 1 %) - most of the other species are discarded, used as bait in traps or consumed by the fishermen. Catch rates (number of fish per 100 hooks) for hake and for all species combined decreased significantly with hook size. Hake catch size frequency distributions for the different hook sizes in 1997 and 1998 were highly overlapped, with the four different hooks catching a wide range of sizes. Although catch size frequency distributions for the different sized hooks were not significantly different in 1997, hake caught in 1998 were characterised by smaller sizes and size ranges.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a new {{biological}} species of Anisakis Dujardin, 1845, was detected in Kogia breviceps and K. sima from West Atlantic waters (coast of Florida) {{on the basis}} of 19 (nuclear) structural genes studied by multilocus allozyme electrophoresis. Fixed allele differences at 11 enzyme loci were found between specimens of both adults and larvae of the new species and the other Anisakis spp. tested. Reproductive isolation from A. brevispiculata Dollfus, 1968 was demonstrated by the lack of hybrid or recombinant genotypes in mixed infections in K. breviceps. Genetic distance of the new species from its closest relative, A. brevispiculata, was D-Nei= 0. 79. The new species is morphologically different from the other species which have been genetically characterised and from the other Anisakis retained by Davey (1971) as valid or as species inquirendae: the name of Anisakis paggiae n. sp. is proposed for the new taxon. Anisakis Type II larvae (sensu Berland, 1961) from the European hake Merluccius merluccius in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean (Galician coast) and from the <b>scabbard</b> <b>fish</b> Aphanopus carbo in Central Atlantic waters (off Madeira), were identified as A. paggiae n. sp. Its genetic relationships with respect to the seven species previously characterised (A. simplex (Rudolphi, 1809) sensu stricto), A. pegreffii Campana-Rouget & Biocca, 1955, A. simplex, (A. typica (Diesing, 1860), A. ziphidarum Paggi et al., 1998, A. physeteris Baylis, 1923 and A. brevispiculata) were also inferred. Overall, a low genetic identity was detected at allozyme level between the eight Anisakis species. Interspecific genetic identity ranged from I-Nei= 0. 68, between the sibling species of the A. simplex complex, to I-Nei= 0. 00 (no alleles shared at the considered loci) when A. physeteris, A. brevispiculata and the new species were compared with the other species of the genus. Concordant topologies were obtained using both UPGMA and NJ tree analyses for the considered species. In both analyses, A. paggiae n. sp. clustered with A. brevispiculata. They also indciated two main clades, the first including A. physeteris, A. brevispiculata and A. paggiae n. sp., the second containing all of the remaining species (i. e. A. simplex (s. s.), A. pegreffii, A. simplex, A. typica and A. ziphidarum). A deep separation between these two main Anisakis clades, also supported by high bootstrap values at the major nodes, was apparent. This is also supported by differences in adult and larval morphology, as well as with respect to their main definitive hosts. A morphological key for distinguishing adult A. paggiae n. sp., A. physeteris and A. brevispiculata is presented. Allozyme markers for the identification of any life-history stage of the Anisakis spp. so far studied, as well as ecological data on their definitive host preferences and geographical distribution, are updated...|$|E
