40|$|When {{developing}} e-services, it {{is important}} to select an e-service <b>system</b> <b>architecture</b> that ensures that the e-service complies with all the quality criteria set for it in order to facilitate broader application of the e-service. This means {{that it is necessary to}} use effective design methods to create e-service systems that ensure the creation of an acceptable e-services <b>system</b> <b>architecture.</b> <b>Existing</b> design methods address the quality aspects, but they have a drawback - system architect's subjective opinion that not always might lead to the best solution. Instead, an e-services system design method that is based on formal use of optimization methods can be employed. Initially the e-service algorithm graph is created, and by recurSively segmenting its vertices in all possible ways the web service graphs are obtained. The segmentation of the algorithm graph means that all the possible solutions that can affect the quality of the e-service <b>system</b> <b>architecture</b> are dealt with. Using multi-criteria optimisation, a Pareto optimality set is obtained from all the web service graphs and the web service graphs of the obtained set can serve as the basis for selecting an acceptable e-service <b>system</b> <b>architecture...</b>|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{approach}} to developing models of analogical reasoning within production <b>system</b> <b>architectures.</b> Though <b>existing</b> theories of analogy have succeeded in capturing many aspects of analogical behavior, they have several limitations. First, the theories use empirical support that focuses almost exclusively on high-level data that illustrate the results of analogy, ignoring low-level data that illustrate step-by-step processes during analogy. Second, the theories cannot fully account for variability prevalent in analogical behavior, nor can they account for the adaptation of analogical strategies in learning. Third, some of the theories cannot be readily incorporated into a unified theory of cognition. We show how production rule models of analogy can address {{and to some extent}} overcome these limitations. As our exemplar, we describe empirical and modeling results for a task in which subjects solved simple physics problems by analogy. The empirical results, which include both high [...] ...|$|R

Currently, an intuitive and flexible usage is often limited because of the monolithic <b>system</b> <b>architecture</b> of <b>existing</b> Self-Service <b>Systems.</b> Furthermore, today’s Self-Service Systems represent the one-and-only endpoint of communication with a customer when processing a transaction.

The user does not immerse completely into a virtual, computer generated environment, instead he stays in his real environment that gets augmented with virtual objects.

40|$|Navy {{acquisition}} activities frequently produce combat <b>system</b> <b>architectures</b> {{based on}} <b>existing</b> <b>systems</b> rather than stakeholder requirements. This approach limits software component reuse which, in turn, limits potential application to other platforms. The {{objective of this}} Capstone project {{was to develop a}} methodology for creating complex combat <b>system</b> <b>architectures</b> that emphasize the use of Software Product Lines (SPLs), requirements traceability, integrated supportability and Modeling and Simulation (M&S) early and throughout the approach. To address this objective, an integrated methodology that utilizes Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to create open, supportable combat <b>system</b> <b>architectures</b> was developed. The methodology was evaluated by applying it to a naval surface combatant Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) mission area. Application of the methodology led to the following major findings: (1) Proven systems engineering practices, languages and tools can be integrated with the MBSE approach for developing complex architectures, (2) Creation of domain centered SPLs facilitates planned reuse and allows for assessment to candidate architectures, (3) Requirements traceability can be achieved by using a combination of modeling languages and tools, (4) M&S application can extend beyond operational scenarios to address life cycle cost, and (5) Engineers and logisticians can effectively use MBSE to integrate supportability into design. Overall, this project demonstrated the benefits of an MBSE approach tailored to developing affordable and supportable combat <b>system</b> <b>architectures</b> that meet mission requirements...|$|R

An efficient water management system requires thousands of constraint devices (sensors and/or actuators) to be deployed across the water distribution network to enable near-real time monitoring {{and control of the}} water grid components. Security at both the device and network level is critical to the operation of such a system. Although several IT security controls have developed over the past few decades, they cannot be used directly with such constraint devices.

This paper describes the architecture of such Social VPNs and a prototype implementation which integrates the Facebook API, IP-over-P 2 P virtual networks, and the IPsec security infrastructure in a virtual router.

40|$|Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) {{attacks have}} become wide-spread on the Internet. They {{continuously}} target retail merchants, financial companies and government institutions, disrupting {{the availability of}} their online resources and causing {{millions of dollars of}} financial losses. Software vulnerabilities and proliferation of malware have helped create a class of application-level DDoS attacks using networks of compromised hosts (botnets). In a botnet-based DDoS attack, an attacker orders large numbers of bots to send seemingly regular HTTP and HTTPS requests to a web server, so as to deplete the server's CPU, disk, or memory capacity. Researchers have proposed client authentication mechanisms, such as CAPTCHA puzzles, to distinguish bot traffic from legitimate client activity and discard bot-originated packets. However, CAPTCHA authentication is vulnerable to denial-of-service and artificial intelligence attacks. This dissertation proposes that clients instead use hardware tokens to authenticate in a federated authentication environment. The federated authentication solution must resist both man-in-the-middle and denial-of-service attacks. The proposed <b>system</b> <b>architecture</b> uses the Kerberos protocol to satisfy both requirements. This work proposes novel extensions to Kerberos to make it more suitable for generic web authentication. A server could verify client credentials and blacklist repeated offenders. Traffic from blacklisted clients, however, still traverses the server's network stack and consumes server resources. This work proposes Sentinel, a dedicated front-end network device that intercepts server-bound traffic, verifies authentication credentials and filters blacklisted traffic before it reaches the server. Using a front-end device also allows transparently deploying hardware acceleration using network co-processors. Network co-processors can discard blacklisted traffic at the hardware level before it wastes front-end host resources.
