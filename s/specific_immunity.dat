5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate {{the immune system and}} develop <b>specific</b> <b>immunity</b> against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{immunological}} adaptation, it {{was discovered}} that wild common ostriches have a pronounced non <b>specific</b> <b>immunity</b> defense, with blood content reflecting high values of lysosome, and phagocyte cells in medium. This is in contrast to domesticated ostriches, who in captivity develop high concentration of immunoglobulin antibodies in their circulation, indicating an acquired immunological response. It is suggested that this immunological adaptability may allow this species to have a high success rate of survival in variable environmental settings.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} {{immune response}} is active later in infection and involves both B cells and T cells. Severe sporotrichosis is rare in endemic areas where humans are in near constant contact with S. schenckii spores. This fact, combined with the increased severity of disease in immunocompromised patients points to an important role for <b>specific</b> <b>immunity</b> in S. schenckii infection. Patients with sporotrichosis {{have been shown to}} produce antibodies specific to S. schenckii and these antibodies may actually be protective against the disease.|$|E
40|$|Protective {{immunity}} against blood infections {{of malaria}} is partly {{specific to the}} genotype, or strain, of the parasites. The target antigens of Strain <b>Specific</b> Protective <b>Immunity</b> are expected, therefore, to be antigenically and genetically distinct in different lines of parasite. Here we describe {{the use of a}} genetic approach, Linkage Group Selection, to locate the target(s) of Strain <b>Specific</b> Protective <b>Immunity</b> in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi. In a previous such analysis using the progeny of a genetic cross between P. c. chabaudi lines AS-pyr 1 and CB, a location on P. c. chabaudi chromosome 8 containing the gene for merozoite surface protein- 1, a known candidate antigen for Strain <b>Specific</b> Protective <b>Immunity,</b> was strongly selected. P. c. chabaudi apical membrane antigen- 1, another candidate for Strain <b>Specific</b> Protective <b>Immunity,</b> could not have been evaluated in this cross as AS-pyr 1 and CB are identical within the cell surface domain of this protein. Here we use Linkage Group Selection analysis of Strain <b>Specific</b> Protective <b>Immunity</b> in a cross between P. c. chabaudi lines CB-pyr 10 and AJ, in which merozoite surface protein- 1 and apical membrane antigen- 1 are both genetically distinct. In this analysis strain specific immune selection acted strongly on the region of P. c. chabaudi chromosome 8 encoding merozoite surface protein- 1 and, less strongly, on the P. c. chabaudi chromosome 9 region encoding apical membrane antigen- 1. The evidence from these two independent studies indicates that Strain <b>Specific</b> Protective <b>Immunity</b> in P. c. chabaudi in mice is mainly determined by a narrow region of the P. c. chabaudi genome containing the gene for the P. c. chabaudi merozoite surface protein- 1 protein.

25|$|The {{system is}} highly {{adaptable}} because of somatic hypermutation (a process of accelerated somatic mutations), and V(D)J recombination (an irreversible genetic recombination of antigen receptor gene segments).

25|$|Immunopathology is {{a branch}} of {{clinical}} pathology that deals with an organism’s immune response to a certain disease. When a foreign antigen enters the body, there is either an antigen specific or nonspecific response to it. These responses are the immune system fighting off the foreign antigens, whether they are deadly or not. Immunopathology could refer to how the foreign antigens cause the immune system to have a response or problems that can arise from an organism’s own immune response on itself. There are certain problems or faults in the immune system {{that can lead to}} more serious illness or disease. These diseases can come from one of the following problems. The first would be Hypersensitivity reactions, where there would be a stronger immune response than normal. There are four different types (type one, two, three and four), all with varying types and degrees of an immune response. The problems that arise from each type vary from small allergic reactions to more serious illnesses such as tuberculosis or arthritis. The second kind of complication in the immune system is Autoimmunity, where the immune system would attack itself rather than the antigen. Inflammation {{is a prime example of}} autoimmunity, as the immune cells used are self-reactive. A few examples of autoimmune diseases are Type 1 diabetes, Addison’s disease and Celiac disease. The third and final type of complication with the immune system is Immunodeficiency, where the immune system lacks the ability to fight off a certain disease. The immune system’s ability to combat it is either hindered or completely absent. The two types are Primary Immunodeficiency, where the immune system is either missing a key component or does not function properly, and Secondary Immunodeficiency, where disease is obtained from an outside source, like radiation or heat, and therefore cannot function properly. Diseases that can cause immunodeficiency include HIV, AIDS and leukemia. In all vertebrates, there are two different kinds of immune responses: Innate and Adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is used to fight off non-changing antigens and is therefore considered nonspecific. It is usually a more immediate response than the adaptive immune system, usually responding within minutes to hours. It is composed of physical blockades such as the skin, but also contains nonspecific immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, T Cells, and basophils. The second for of immunity is Adaptive immunity. This form of immunity requires recognition of the foreign antigen before a response is produced. Once the antigen is recognized, a specific response is produced in order to destroy the specific antigen. Because of this idea, adaptive immunity is considered to be <b>specific</b> <b>immunity.</b> A key part of adaptive immunity that separates it from innate is the use of memory to combat the antigen in the future. When the antigen is originally introduced, the organism does not have any receptors for the antigen so it must generate them from the first time the antigen is present. The immune system then builds a memory of that antigen, which enables it to recognize the antigen quicker in the future and be able to combat it quicker and more efficiently. The more the system is exposed to the antigen, the quicker it will build up its responsiveness.|$|E

For the lymphocyte transformation assay, multiple concentrations of phytohemagglutinin and purified HBsAg were used as stimulants. Cell-mediated immunity to HBsAg was detectable in 50 % of the chronic HBsAg carriers (responders) at one or more concentrations of HBsAg.
