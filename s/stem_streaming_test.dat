50|$|Germany's DIN4102 also {{includes}} a significant impact test for a potential firewall, which is, however, applied from the wrong side: the cold side. Applying the impact from the cold side is more practical {{to do in a}} lab setting, however, potential impacts should come from the exposed side, not the unexposed side. Still, for the person designing, building and paying for the test, the fire resistance itself may be rather uneventful unless major problems appear. The burn itself is the long duration, up to 4 hours, but the hose <b>stream</b> <b>test</b> only lasts a few minutes, with large damage potential due to the sudden thermal and kinetic impacts, as the fire was upwards of 1,100 °C (see curves above), whereas the sudden hose-stream test is as cold as the domestic water fed to the fire hose used in the test, which might be 10-20 °C. This combined impact explains the debris that can be seen coming from test specimens during the hose <b>stream</b> <b>test,</b> as seen herein.|$|R

40|$|A {{water tunnel}} is a device used in {{hydraulic}} research and design studies {{for the purpose}} of observing the relative motion between a solid body and a liquid and the effect which this motion has on the body. Its basic function is the production of a <b>test</b> <b>stream</b> of water of uniform and controllable pressure and velocity in which solid bodies can be supported under varying conditions. The free-jet type of water tunnel has a <b>test</b> <b>stream</b> which, ideally, is surrounded by a gaseous medium and which, practically, has only a partial solid-contact boundary required to permit observation of the interior of the stream. This type of tunnel thus differs from conventional water tunnels such as the closed-jet water tunnel, which has a <b>test</b> <b>stream</b> completely surrounded by a solid-contact surface, and the open-jet water tunnel, which has a <b>test</b> <b>stream</b> surrounded by water and which thus resembles a submerged jet. The essentially unbounded nature of the <b>test</b> <b>stream</b> of the free-jet water tunnel permits deformation of the <b>test</b> <b>stream</b> and avoids formation of adverse pressure and velocity gradients which form in conventional water tunnels because of gravitational effects and boundary layer formation; the result is that in the free-jet water tunnel, natural cavitation about solid bodies in the <b>test</b> <b>stream</b> can be studied at lower cavitation indices and with less influence due to the finite extent of the <b>test</b> <b>stream</b> than is possible in conventional tunnels.

Conelly's Run flows through the park and provides great crayfish hunting for the passerby during the summer months. Wildwood Park is the only perfectly preserved place in Radford. With limited exotic species, no buildings or sports fields, and many walking and biking trails, the park represents the way Radford looked before the coming of the railroad. Wildwood Park is a very quiet place where many types of native animals like birds, raccoons, opossums, skunks, and groundhogs decide to make their homes. In the spring, people travel from all over the state and sometimes country to see the wide variety of wildflowers.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a trace-driven simulation study of {{two classes of}} retransmission timeout (RTO) estimators {{in the context of}} realtime streaming over the Internet. We explore the viability of employing retransmission timeouts in NACK-based (i. e., rate-based) streaming applications to support multiple retransmission attempts per lost packet. The first part of our simulation is based on trace data collected during a number of real-time <b>streaming</b> <b>tests</b> between dialup clients in all 50 states in the U. S. (including 653 major U. S. cities) and a backbone video server. The second part of the study is based on <b>streaming</b> <b>tests</b> over DSL and ISDN access links. First, we define a generic performance measure for assessing the accuracy of hypothetical RTO estimators based on the samples of the round-trip delay (RTT) recorded in the trace data. Second, using this performance measure, we evaluate the class of TCP-like estimators and find the optimal estimator given our performance measure. Third, we introduce a new class of estimators based on delay jitter and show that they significantly outperform TCP-like estimators in NACK-based applications with low-frequency RTT sampling. Finally, we show that highfrequency sampling of the RTT completely changes the situation and makes the class of TCP-like estimators as accurate as the class of delay-jitter estimators. 1...|$|R

As a delay based protocol, it measures the delay at the end host and adjusts the congestion window accordingly. As our NS- 2 simulation results show, the late packet of the video streams are greatly decreased when applying PERT in heterogeneous environment. Furthermore, our Linux live <b>streaming</b> <b>test</b> indicates that PERT is able to reduce the playback glitches, when high resolution video is delivered over an end-to-end link with latency and packet loss.

The entire assembly is exposed to a fire for the specified amount of time per the objective of the test. Following this heat exposure, a hose stream is applied to the door. Fire doors and fire dampers are derated from the fire barriers they are in. In this case, a 3-hour rated door is acceptable for use in up to a 4-hour wall.

For the semileptonic mode, the measured cross section is σtt ̄ = 740 ± 57 pb without b-tagging and σtt ̄ = 788 ± 50 pb when using b-tagging.

40|$|Abstract — As {{broadband}} access becomes more widely available and affordable, future Internet traffic will {{be dominated by}} streaming media flows, such as video-telephony, video-conferencing, high definition TV, 3 D video, virtual reality, and many more. Consequently, networks will have to offer quality of service with scalable solutions — i. e., currently reliedupon overprovisioning {{is not likely to}} be a viable solution to accommodate streaming media traffic. This paper describes a testbed and experiments demonstrating the deployment timedriven priority scheduling — an implementation of pipeline forwarding — to support video streaming. The purpose of the presented experiments is to intuitively show the benefits the proposed solution provides to UDP-based streaming applications, while preserving efficient support for elastic TCP-based traffic.

TheREgressive Admission Control (REAC) system consists of three modules performing thenecessary tasks:QoS measurements, traffic identification, and the actual AC decision making and flowcontrol. There are two major advantages with this new scheme; (i) significant optimization of theconnection start-up phase, and (ii) continuous QoSknowledge of the accepted streams. In fact, the lattercombined with the REAC decisions can enable guaranteed QoS without requiring any QoS support fromthe network.
