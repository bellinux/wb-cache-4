40|$|Two {{types of}} tread wear {{particles}} are investigated: tread wear particles from a <b>steel</b> <b>brush</b> abrader (TrBP) and particles produced during a steering pad run (TrSP). A leaching experiment in water at pH = 7. 5 for 24 and 48 h {{was carried out}} on TrBP to simulate environmental degradation. Images of all materials were collected by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) together with element microanalytical (EDX) data. Surface morphology is described by a function of wave number (the “enhanced spectrum”) obtained from SEM image analysis and non-linear filtering. A surface roughness index, ρ, {{is derived from the}} enhanced spectrum. The innovative contribution of this work is the representation of morphology by means of ρ, which, together with EDX data, allows the quantitative characterization of the materials. In particular, the surface roughness of leached TrBP is shown to decay in time and is related to the corresponding microanalytical data for the first time. The morphology of steering pad TrSP, affected by included mineral particles, is shown to be more heterogeneous. Differences in morphology (enhanced spectra and ρ), elemental composition and surface chemistry of TrBP and TrSP are discussed. All methods described and implemented herewith can be immediately applied to other types of tread wear material. The arguments put forward herewith should help in the proper design of those experiments aimed at assessing the impact of tread wear materials on the environment and on human health...|$|E

The specimens of size 38  mm in diameter and 76  mm in height were prepared by compacting it statically in UCS mould to achieve MDD at OMC. The specimens were than ejected from mould using extractor and wrapped in polythene bag for 24  h to avoid any moisture loss. After that the specimens were cured for 7  days and thereafter were immersed in water for 5  h followed by drying in oven at 70  °C for 42  h which form one wet dry cycle. This test procedure continued up to 12 cycles. After end of each cycle the specimens were brushed along the height as well as diameter with a <b>steel</b> <b>brush</b> at approximately 1.4  kgf force and soil cement losses were recorded in percentage. Portland Cement Association [25] has recommended that after completion of 12 wet dry cycles the soil–cement loss of granular soils of low plasticity and cohesive clays should not exceed limit of 14 and 7 % respectively and for silty soil it should not exceed the limit of 10 %. But from some other studies the above recommended limits {{were found to be}} stringent. As mentioned in IRC SP 89 [12] soils are not permitted to loss 20, 30 and 30 % for its use for construction of base, subbase and shoulder respectively and for subgrade nothing has been specified. So, for the contaminated dredged soil which is silty in nature and for use in subgrade, the loss of soil–cement limit after completion of 12 wet dry cycles is considered as maximum 10 % in this study.|$|E
40|$|Biaxial {{compression}} {{tests on}} cubic concrete specimens {{were performed on}} a newly designed triaxial machine. Specially designed <b>steel</b> <b>brush</b> platens were adopted in biaxial experiments to reduce the end friction {{in order to obtain}} real uniform compression state in the specimens. Concrete with different maximum aggregate sizes were tested for their biaxial compressive strength, with fracture energy and characteristic length examined at the same time. It was found that the biaxial compressive strength of concrete was intrinsically dependent on the fracture energy and characteristic length rather than the uniaxial strength. Therefore, by introducing the fracture parameters, a trend of biaxial failure envelope can be more accurately described than previous research in which the uniaxial strength was always taken as the basis for deriving the envelope. This finding may provide a more accurate design criterion based on fracture parameters in multiaxial problems. On the other hand, numerical simulation of concrete behavior under uniaxial tension, uniaxial compression and combined compression-tension was carried out based on a proposed local softening model by the nonlinear finite element software ATENA. Pure mode I crack was assumed under uniaxial tension and the equivalent wing crack system was employed for uniaxial compression and biaxial compression-tension. The local softening behavior was simulated by means of the interface material model in ATENA. The relationships among the uniaxial compressive strength, tensile strength and the fracture energy under tension were well reproduced compared with the empirical relations. This implies that the local softening law can be viewed as the linkage of these macroscopic properties. Numerical biaxial compressive-tensile strengths based on the local softening model also showed good agreement with available experimental results. Therefore, non-linear fracture mechanics with the local softening law at the sub-macro-scale seems to be suitable for analyzing concrete behaviors at the macro-scale...|$|E
40|$|New {{problems}} arise in urban weed control on hard surfaces {{as a direct}} response {{to the use of}} new methods and reduced economical resources. Weed established on hard surfaces involve esthetic, functional as well as technical problems. Numerous of hard surfaces in urban areas in Sweden were constructed when chemical weed control was permitted without restrictions. The aim of this investigation was to study the number of treatment and labor required for different methods of urban weed control. The energy use and the amount of carbon dioxide emission for the methods were also calculated. The experiments were carried out (May until November, in l 996) in two cities in southern Sweden; Lund and Ystad. The investigated methods, which were studied as single methods and in different combinations, was flaming, brushing (wire brush and <b>steel</b> <b>brush),</b> sweeping, acetic acid, glyphosate and manual weeding. This study shows that manual weeding and the use of glyphosate needed least amount of treatment (2 times) per year while wire brush combined with sweeper needed the largest amount (8 times). Calculated per treatment manual weeding was the least energy consuming method while wire brushing with truck was the most energy consuming. With the exception of manual weeding glyphosate (manual spraying and sweeping) gave the least energy consuming and the least carbon dioxide generating method over the season while wire brushing with truck was both the greatest energy consuming method and the greatest emittor of carbon dioxide. Neither an energy analysis nor a calculation of carbon dioxide emission can answer the question which one of the methods has the least environmental impact. The energy consumption and the carbon dioxide emission should be looked upon as one of many parameters in a more extensive basis of resolution. If used on other locations it is needed to deduct a recalculation based upon the local circumstances. Future weed control will involve the use of different methods such as chemical, mechanical and thermal methods. Weed control has to be a result of a combination of preventive and different direct weed control methods. In a sustainable society weed control according to requirements is recommended...|$|E

40|$|The {{stress state}} at the {{boundary}} of any underground mine opening is that of plane stress. This planar state of stress can be simulated in laboratory by subjecting a cubic rock specimen to a biaxial loading condition. Thus, research on the behaviour of biaxially loaded rock is important for {{better understanding of the}} stability of mining fronts such as crown pillar skin, drift face or shaft floor. The objective of this research is to study the geomechanical behaviour of biaxially loaded rock. Three rock types were selected, namely limestone, granite and sandstone. The laboratory work was conducted using a newly developed, 500 -tonne biaxial loading frame, that is equipped with a servo-controlled load and displacement system. Recently patented in China, the new biaxial loading frame is spatially symmetric and equally rigid in both directions. <b>Steel</b> <b>brush</b> platens and solid platens with and without MoS 2 were developed to help examine the end friction effect on biaxial strength. It is found that the biaxial strength can decrease up to 26. 7 % with the increase of cubic specimen size from 75 mm to 150 mm. The biaxial strength increases by 29. 3 % with the increase of loading rate from 1 MPa/s to 10 MPa/s, for granite. The biaxial strength of granite specimen decreases by nearly 6 % when either solid platens with MoS 2 lubricant or brush platens are used. A comparison of the sigma 1 -sigma 2 failure envelopes reveals that the shape of the envelope and the location of the peak biaxial strength are dependent on the rock type. Varying intensities of rock spalling generally initiate at the free faces of the specimen when sigma 1 and sigma 2 exceed sigma c/ 2. Ultimate failure occurs {{in the form of an}} out-of-plane shear failure, which splits the rock specimen into two or more wedges. It is shown that both Mohr-Coulomb and Hoek-Brown criteria underestimate the biaxial strength of the rock. The Drucker-Prager failure criterion appears to provide poor correlation with experimental results. A new empirical biaxial rock failure criterion for intact rock is derived and another, accounting for rock mass characteristics through the Geological Strength Index (GSI), is then proposed...|$|E
40|$|Resumo: O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a rugosidade {{superficial}} de três marcas comerciais de compósitos (Herculite XR, Prisma APH e P 50); dois ionômeros de vidro (Vidrion R e Chelon Fil) e um amálgama (Dispersalloy), submetidos à ação de um dentifrício (Kolynos Super Branco / Anakol), num ensaio de escovação in vitro. Os corpos de prova foram confeccionados em matrizes de plax-glass com dimensões de 20 x 10 x 2 mm, em número de oito, para cada material. Para a realização do ensaio foi utilizada uma máquina de escovação (Equilabor) com escovas extra-macias (Prevent 30 / Anakol) sob a ação de uma carga de 200 g. Cada material foi submetido a 250 escovações por minuto, num período de 2 horas, totalizando 30. 000 ciclos por amostra. Com auxílio do perfilômetro Perth-O-Meter M 2 P (Perthen-Mahr / Alemanha), utilizando o parâmetro Ra (rugosidade média), foram realizadas seis leituras para medida da rugosidade em cada corpo de prova, totalizando 288 leituras no experimento completo. Os resultados da análise estatística mostraram que não houve alteração da textura superficial dos materiais submetidos apenas à ação de uma escova extramacia em água destilada, porém quando foi acrescido o dentifrício, todos os materiais restauradores tiveram a sua topografia alterada. O material que apresentou a superfície-controle com maior rugosidade superficial inicial foi o Dispersalloy (0, 6394 &# 956;m), seguido pelo Vidrion R (0, 2697 &# 956;m), Chelon Fil (0, 1760 &# 956;m), Herculite XR (0, 0491 &# 956;m), P 50 (0, 0342 &# 956;m) e por último o Prisma APH (0, 0338 &# 956;m). Porém, esta ordem foi alterada, após o ensaio de escovação, ou seja, o Vidrion R apresentou a maior rugosidade (1, 2508 &# 956;m), seguido pelo HercuJite XR (1, 0300 p,m), Chelon Fil (0, 6210 &# 956;m), Prisma APH (0, 4542 &# 956;m), Dispersaloy (0, 4082 &# 956;m) e por último, o P 50 (0, 2754 &# 956;m). Também foi possível observar que em todos os materiais ocorreu um aumento da rugosidade superficial, exceto para o amálgama, que reduziu a rugosidade inicial para os níveis mais baixos, sem apresentar diferença estatística significativa, a nível de ' 5 % de significância, quando comparado com os materiais menos rugosos após a escovação (APH e P 50). Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the surface roughness oí direct restorative materiaIs (composite resins, glass ionomers and amalgam) submitted to a in vitro toothbrushing test. Three composite resins (Herculite XR, Prisma APH and P 50), two glass ionomers (Vidrion R and Chelon Fil) and an amalgam (Dispersalloy) were studied. Eigth samples of each material were obtained in plaxglass matrices measuring 20 x 10 x 2 mm. The tooth brushing machine had eight containers and the specimens were fixed in the botton of them. The brushes used were the Prevent 30 (Anakol) extra-soft type. These brushes wete glued to the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>brush</b> holder. The load af the brush was 200 g. The toothpaste used for these experimet was Kolynos Super Branco (Anakol), and the slurry was made by mixing 6 ml of distilled water and 6 g of toothpaste. Seven of the eight containers, with the specimens in position, received the slurry, and the last, only distilled water. The eletric motor produced 250 strokes / min and the machine was activated until the counter registered 30, 000 strokes. The brushes and the slurry were substituted for each material. Concluded the brushing cycle of two hours the specimens were removed from the machine, washed in tap water and stored at 37 ºC and 100 % relative umidity of the air until measuring the surface roughness. The specimens were then placed on a profilometer (Perth-O-Meter M 2 P / Perthen-Mahr) to measure the surface roughness, in micrometers, by the Ra parameter. A total of 288 readings were made in 48 samples. The statistic analyses of the results showed that the brushing with extra-soft brush and water didn't affect the surface topography of the analised materials. But; when the toothpaste was associated to the brushes, all materials showed an alteration of the surface topography. The material with the roughest inicial surface was Dispersalloy (0, 6394 &# 956;m), followed by Vidrion R (0, 2697 &# 956;m), Chelon Fil (0, 1760 &# 956;m), Herculite XR (0, 0491 &# 956;m), P 50 (0, 0342 &# 956;m) and Prisma APH (0, 0338 &# 956;m). After the toothbrushing test, the roughest material was Vidrion R (1, 2508 &# 956;m), followed by Herclliite XR (1, 0300 &# 956;m), Chelon Fil (0, 6210 &# 956;m), Prisma APH (0, 4542 &# 956;m), Dispersalloy (0, 4082 &# 956;m) and P 50 (0, 2754 &# 956;m). In all materials an increase of the roughness occured except for the amalgam in which the inicial roughness was reduced.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to propose a method of strain {{measurements}} under multi-axial stress condition. By adopting the cube specimen, we can apply the load different from each other in three directions. At the triaxial test, six <b>steel</b> <b>brushes</b> covered the specimen, and there was no space to put wire strain gages or displacement devices on the surfaces of the specimen. Therefore, the cube specimen with chamfered edges was selected to measure strains by utilizing the chamfered edges. Six pairs of displacement measuring devices were set on the chamfered edges of the specimen in three directions (α, β, γ) as shown in Fig. 2. The deformation in a specific direction was measured as the sum of the outputs from a pair of displacement devices placed in the diagonal and opposite edges in the same direction of the specimen. The strains, ε_X, Ε_Y and E_Z in X, Y and Z directions can be written in the equation (10), as the terms higher than the second order are negligibly small. The experimental strains that were measured in the manner described above are compared with the strains that were measured with wire strain gages mounted on its sides, both in the uniaxial compression test of the same specimen. The stress-strain relations of the two were almost the same, so that the validity of the method of strain measurement proposed in this study is experimentally proved...|$|R
