50|$|The {{habitat of}} the <b>star</b> <b>finch</b> is {{threatened}} by overgrazing of grasslands, removing essential cover for their survival as well as sources of food and water. Selective grazing of perennials during the wet season may also remove grasses that are needed for survival {{during the dry season}}. Burning of grassland during the dry season may reduce the fallen seed during the wet season and thus reduce the food supply needed by the <b>star</b> <b>finch.</b> This species is also threatened by the cage-bird trade.|$|E

40|$|Surveys for the {{endangered}} <b>Star</b> <b>Finch</b> (Neochmia ruficauda clarescens (Hartert)) {{were conducted in}} the early wet season on Cape York Peninsula. We found Star Finches in only two grassland vegetation types. Most sightings were on unburnt islands of grass and saltbush on tidal saltpans where the birds were feeding solely on {{the seeds of the}} annual grass Xerochloa imberbis R. Br. Some individuals were also found among tall perennial grasses further inland where they fed on the first seed production of the new wet season. Xerochloa imberbis is probably a critical food source and saltpans a critical habitat for survival of this population of Star Finches during the early wet season...|$|E
