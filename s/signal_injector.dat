40|$|Present {{trend of}} laying cables for various {{purposes}} is to lay underground. Companies prefer laying the cables underground because the climatic adversities don’t affect this. With advantages come challenges. There are many difficulties in laying the cables and once laid {{in case of}} any complaints, it is difficult and costly to fix it. This paper is about the robot that is designed by us which is capable of finding where the complaint lies, so the engineer can directly get the hole dug at that point and fix the issue. The basic principle of Electromagnetic Theory is employed to detect the discontinuity in the cable. Using a <b>signal</b> <b>injector,</b> a low frequency signal is passed through the wire and the induced magnetic field is used to detect the fault. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{completed}} {{as a part}} of the project "Microwave wireless Communication Link". In this thesis, the requirements to develop base band part for the transceiver were studied, including, usage of proper hardware equipment as well as software programming. A <b>signal</b> <b>injector</b> performed as a hardware interface between the Analog part and the Digital (base band) part of the tranceiver, whereas, a PCI card acted as a data acquisition device for base band part. A programming language was required to build such a software, able to successfully represent a transmitter and a receiver. All the features were found in Labview (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench) introduced by National Instruments in 1980 s. A modern version of Labview i. e. version 7. 1, was used in this thesis, it views the software as a virtual instrument to automate and measure the values passed from the connected hardware. Labview provides a graphical development environment, which is modular and parallel in nature, and uses an efficient G compiler. A coherent base band receiver using matched filter was implemented, and a base band transmitter using NRZ-L digital encoding scheme and QPSK modulation scheme was developed...|$|E

The sensors that supply the engine load and engine speed <b>signals</b> for <b>injector</b> {{duration}} {{provide information about}} the basic ignition timing point.

50|$|The average {{level of}} the sensor is near to 450 mV. Since {{catalytic}} coverters need a cycling a/f ratio the oxygen sensor {{is not allowed to}} hold a fixed voltage, the ECU controls the engine by providing the mixture between lean (and rich) in such a sufficiently fast manner by means of shorter (or longer) time of <b>signal</b> to <b>injectors,</b> so the average level becomes as stated about 450 mV.|$|R
50|$|Many more engine {{parameters}} are actively monitored and controlled in real-time. There are about 20 to 50 that measure pressure, temperature, flow, engine speed, oxygen level and NOx level plus other parameters {{at different points}} within the engine. All these sensor signals are sent to the ECU, which has the logic circuits to do the actual controlling. The ECU output is connected to different actuators for the throttle valve, EGR valve, rack (in VGTs), fuel injector (using a pulse-width modulated <b>signal),</b> dosing <b>injector</b> and more. There are about 20 to 30 actuators in all.|$|R
40|$|Measurements and {{modeling}} of electron spin transport and dynamics {{are used to}} characterize hyperfine interactions in Fe/GaAs devices with $n$-GaAs channels. Ga and As nuclei are polarized by electrically injected electron spins, and the nuclear polarization is detected indirectly through the depolarization of electron spins in the hyperfine field. The dependence of the electron spin <b>signal</b> on <b>injector</b> bias and applied field direction is modeled by a coupled drift-diffusion equation, including effective fields from both the electronic and nuclear polarizations. This approach is {{used to determine the}} electron spin polarization independently of the assumptions made in standard transport measurements. The extreme sensitivity of the electron spin dynamics to the nuclear spin polarization also facilitates the electrical detection of nuclear magnetic resonance. Comment: Submitted to Phys.

40|$|There {{exists a}} growing {{interest}} in Hybrid rocket engines over the last years. Lots of {{research has been done}} on hybrids in general and on topics like combustion efficiency and stability in detail. But only minor work has been done on the design and performance of the injector type. This is especially important since combustion stability can be closely linked to the type of injector and configuration of the pre-combustion chamber. In the present paper a detailed review on earlier work regarding combustion stability has been done. Hot flow experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of different injector types including impingement, showerhead and swirl injectors. Characteristic velocity, ISP efficiency and regression rates during hot fire tests are evaluated and compared. Combustion stability is evaluated by means of Fast-Fourier Transformations and spectrograms of the pressure <b>signals.</b> Impingement <b>injectors</b> with high impingement angles produce unstable flow fields which excite vortex shedding and the Helmholtz acoustic mode of the combustion chamber...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis work aims at {{monitoring}} {{diesel engine}} {{fuel injection system}} by analyzing the cylinder head variations. It focuses on dual-peak phenomenon in combustion stage signal of cylinder head vibration under certain work condition. The first peak of dual-peak is the vibratory response <b>signal</b> of fuel <b>injector</b> needle valve crash which is proved by the time domain analysis between cylinder head vibration and in-cylinder combustion pressure, analysis for cylinder head vibration of misfire and analysis of fuel feeding law change following engine rotational speed. The start time of the fuel injector needle valve crash vibratory response signal can describe the fuel injector needle valve closing timing. The acceleration peak of fuel injector needle valve crash vibratory response signal can describe crash strength. From the results under different work conditions and faulty conditions it is revealed that these characteristics can accurately describe injection information {{and can be used}} for fuel injection system fault diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The primary {{function}} of an {{electronic control unit}} (ECU) of an engine is to calculate the amount of fuel to be delivered into the combustion chamber. The injection duration and duty cycle of the injector {{will be based on}} several sensors whose signals the ECU will process to ensure the best engine running condition. However, to study new injection and combustion strategies, where such operation is unavailable in standard ECU, a custom-built fuel injection control system need to be made. This paper describes the development of a fuel <b>injector</b> <b>signal</b> controller, which is being used for internal combustion engine experiment or for the evaluation of any fuel injector static flow rate. Herewith a new term Injector-Volume Ratio (IVR) was introduced to assist the development process. Using the custom-built fuel injection controller, the static flow rate of an injector for a single cylinder 125 cc motorcycle engine was determined in accordance to SAEJ 1832. From the experiment, the IVR value is proven useful in choosing the right size of a fuel injector to fit any specified engine displacement of a spark ignition engine...|$|R
40|$|This Master’s thesis {{discusses}} {{the investigation of}} autoignition (knock) of air-fuel mixtures in internal combustion engines (type EA 827; 1. 6 and 1. 4 l) under hot start conditions. Chapter Three comprehensively reviews literature on fuel characteristics; specifically boiling point, chemistry {{and the difference between}} the Research and Motor Octane Number (RON and MON). Furthermore different types of autoignition are discussed with regards to their detection and assessment in the chapter. The subsection on engine management looks at possible methods of altering and eliminating autoignition. Chapter Four details the equipment used to obtain data and measurements, as well as the signal conditioning of the spark and <b>injector</b> <b>signal.</b> Chapter Five {{discusses the}} actual results obtained during summer testing of the different methods of altering and eliminating autoignition in an internal combustion engine, as derived from the theories presented in Chapter Three. The summer tests finally verified the new application level and showed that only a reduction in the quantity of fuel injected can eliminate autoignition. However, a slight decrease in heat release does cause an increase in start time. In Chapter Six, based on the test results, a simulation model which calculates the probability of autoignition in a 1. 4 l (Econo) engine during hot start conditions in Matlab/Simulink was developed. This simulation model satisfactorily verified test result...|$|R

Operational weakness can possibly lead to the complete machine malfunction, decreasing reliability and leading to loss of production. To overcome these circumstances, various condition monitoring techniques can be applied. The application of acoustic signals is common in the field of fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Advanced signal processing is utilized for the construction of features that are specialized in detecting fuel injector faults. A performance comparison between novelty detection algorithms in the form of one-class classifiers is presented. The one-class classifiers that were tested included One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and One-Class Self Organizing Map (OC-SOM). The acoustic <b>signals</b> of fuel <b>injectors</b> in different operational conditions were processed for feature extraction.

40|$|A {{condition}} monitoring program applied to diesel engines, improves safety, productivity, increases serviceability and reduces maintenance costs. Investigation {{of a novel}} {{condition monitoring}} systems for diesel engine is attracting considerable attention due to both the increasing demands placed upon engine components and the limitations of conventional techniques. This thesis documents research conducted to assess the monitoring capabilities used acoustic emission (AE) analysis. It focuses {{on the possibility of}} using AE signals to monitor the fuel injector and oil condition. A series of experiments were performed on a JCB, four-stroke diesel engine. Tests under healthy operating conditions developed a detailed understanding of typical acoustic emission generation in terms of both the source mechanisms and the characteristics of the resulting activity. This was supplemented by specific tests to investigate possible acoustic emission generation due to the piston slap and friction. The effect of faults on the injector waveform was investigated using the injection system and at one sensor location. To overcome the reflections and injection system configuration effects the method of acoustic emission impedance was used. This enabled the <b>injector</b> <b>signal</b> to be successfully extracted and clearly shows its capability for detecting even minor combustion deviations between engine cylinders. Comparison between signals and measurement of the oil condition showed both provided useful information about the lubrication processes. Simulation and experimental work have demonstrated the capability of this technique to detect lubrication related faults and irregular lubrication variability between the engine's cylinders. A review of the AE sources in diesel engines and how to represent the AE signals generated is presented. Three analysis methods were used: time-domain analysis using parameters such as Root Mean Square (RMS), variance, mean and kurtosis; frequency-domain analysis which relied on the amplitudes of the frequency components of the measured signals; and time-frequency domain analysis extracting features so that the energy content of the signals and the frequency components were localized simultaneously. In this work, data has been obtained from tests on a diesel engine, where the engine load, speed, temperature and the oil lubrication type were changed. The monitored signal and its difference from that obtained for normal engine conditions was noted as a fault signature {{that could be used for}} fault detection and diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a huge rise in {{interest}} in the design of energy efficient wireless sensor networks (WSN) and body area networks (BAN) with the advent of many new applications over the last few decades. The number of sensor nodes in these applications has also increased tremendously in the order of few hundreds in recent years. A typical sensor node in a WSN consists of circuits like RF transceivers, micro-controllers or DSP, ADCs, sensors, and power supply circuits. The RF transmitter and receiver circuits mainly the frequency synthesizers(synthesis of RF carrier and local oscillator signals in transceivers) consume a significant percentage of its total power due to its high frequency of operation. A charge-pump phase locked loop (CP-PLL) is the most commonly used frequency synthesizer architecture in these applications. The growing demands of WSN applications, such as low power consumption larger number of sensor nodes, single chip solution, and longer duration operation presents several design challenges for these transmitter and frequency synthesizer circuits in these applications and a few are listed below, Low power frequency synthesizer and transmitter designs with better spectral performance is essential for an energy efficient operation of these applications. 	The spurious tones in the frequency synthesizer output will mix the interference signals from nearby sensor nodes and from other interference sources present nearby,to degrade the wireless transmitter and receiver performance[1]. With the increased density of sensor nodes (more number of in-band interference sources) and degraded performance of analog circuits in the nano-meter CMOS process technologies, the spur reduction techniques are essential to improve the performance of frequency synthesizers in these applications. A single chip solution of sensor nodes with its analog and digital circuits integrated on the same die is preferred for its low power, low cost, and reduced size implementation. However, the parasitic interactions between these analog and digital sub-systems integrated on a common substrate, degrade the spectral performance of frequency synthesizers in these implementations[2]. Therefore, techniques to improve the mixed signal integration performance of these circuits are in great demand. In this thesis, we present a custom designed energy efficient 2. 4 GHz BFSK/ASK transmitter architecture using a low power frequency synthesizer design technique taking advantage of the CMOS technology scaling benefits. Furthermore, a few design guidelinesandsolutionstoimprovethespectralperformanceoffrequency synthesizer circuits and in-turn the performance of transmitters are also presented. The target application being short distance, low power, and battery operated wireless communication applications. The contributions in this thesis are, Spectral performance improvement techniques The CP mismatch current is a dominant source of reference spurs in the nano-meter CMOS PLL implementations due to its worsened channel length modulation effect [3]. In this work, we present a CP mismatch current calibration technique using an adaptive body bias tuning of its PMOS transistors. Chip prototype of 2. 4 GHzCP-PLLwith the proposed CP calibration technique was fabricated in UMC 0. 13 µm CMOS process. Measurements show a CP mismatch current of less than 0. 3 µA(0. 55 %) using the proposed calibration technique over the VCO control voltage range 0. 3 to 1 V. The closed loop PLL measurements using the proposed technique exhibited a 9 dB reduction in the reference spur levels across the PLL output frequency range 2. 4 - 2. 5 GHz. The parasitic interactions between analog and digital circuits through the common substrate severely affects the performance of CP-PLLs. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the effect of periodic switching noise generated from the digital buffers on the performance of charge-pump PLLs. The sensitivity of PLL performance metrics such as output spur level, phase noise, and output jitter are monitored against the variations in the properties of a noise <b>injector</b> digital <b>signal.</b> Measurements from a 500 MHz CP-PLL shows that the pulsed noise injection with the duty cycle of noise <b>injector</b> <b>signal</b> reduced from 50 % to 20 %, resulted in a 12. 53 dB reduction in its output spur level and a 107 ps reduction in its Pk-Pk deterministic period jitter performance. Low power circuit techniques A low power frequency synthesizer design using a digital frequency multiplication technique is presented. The proposed frequency multiply by 3 digital edge combiner design having a very few logic gates, demonstrated a significant reduction in the power consumption of frequency synthesizer circuits, with an acceptable spectral performance suitable for these relaxed performance applications. A few design guidelines and techniques to further improve its spectral performance are also discussed and validated through simulations. Chip prototypes of 2. 4 GHz CP-PLLs with and without digital frequency multiplier circuits are fabricated in UMC 0. 13 µm CMOS process. The 2. 4 GHz CP-PLL using the proposed digital frequency multiplication technique (10. 7 mW) consumed a much reduced power compared to a conventional implementation(20. 3 mW). A custom designed, energy efficient 2. 4 GHz BFSK/ASK transmitter architecture using the proposed low power frequency synthesizer design technique is presented. The transmitter uses a class-D power amplifier to drive the 50 Ω antenna load. Spur reduction techniques in frequency synthesizers are also used to improve the spectral performance of the transmitter. A chip prototype of the proposed transmitter architecture was implemented in UMC 0. 13 µm CMOS process. The transmitter consume 14 mA current from a 1. 3 V supply voltage and achieve improved energy efficiencies of 0. 91 nJ/bit and 6. 1 nJ/bit for ASK and BFSK modulations with data rates 20 Mb/s & 3 Mb/s respectively...|$|R
