The regular sequence of the strata can often be seen in quarries, or in the escarpments {{on either side of}} the ridge. It is most obvious in the exposures created by the local landslips, where <b>selective</b> <b>erosion</b> of weak strata has destabilized the rocks above. Numerous small quarries adorn its slopes, though all are now abandoned. The shape of the Vale of Ewyas to the south and west of the ridge strongly suggests that it was occupied by a glacier during at least one ice age, though not perhaps during the last ice age. The plateau was probably ice-free.|$|E

These rock cliffs have been modeled from coarse to fine-grained, quartz-feldspar sandstones from the Oligocene-Miocene. The morphology of these cliffs is derived from <b>selective</b> <b>erosion.</b> Their shape is also due to the subvertical attitude of the strata which makes them more resistant to erosion and inhospitable for the vegetation.

In both study areas, <b>selective</b> <b>erosion</b> played an important role, but the rounded bays of NW Gozo are clearly linked to pre-existent subcircular structures due to sinkhole collapse whilst those of SE Malta are not influenced by karst processes.

40|$|From the stratigraphic {{point of}} view the Tretto and Mount Summano area belongs to the so called “Recoarese”, a region {{including}} the upper Agno, the Leogra and the Posina valleys. The Recoarese differs from the neighbouring areas because it contains the southernmost outcrop of the Southalpine crystalline basement. On the basement a thick mainly sedimentary succession lies, which represents the time interval from the upper Permian to lower Miocene. The Triassic system makes exclusive the Recoarese: during the Triassic time this area was mainly a marine environment located on the northern border of a wide emerged area, at present buried beneath the Po Plain alluvial deposits. Detrital inputs from the continent fed the basin, while marginal marine environments were favourable to ecological niches. Marine, coastal and continental facies alternated continuously with time. This {{was due to the}} special paleogeographic location, which registered also slight sea level fluctuations. The recent recognition that most of these fluctuations are eustatic oblige to re-interpret the Recoaro Triassic rocks in terms of sequence stratigraphy. The contribution given by our area is surprising, if we consider that the sequence stratigraphy can interpret global scale events. The outcrop of the crystalline basement and Permo-Triassic units in the Recoarese results from erosion of a block tectonically uplifted during the Neogene shortening of the Southalpine chain. The Mount Summano is carved on an anticline with a steep southern limb developed in the hanging wall of the Bassano Line, which is a SSE-verging thrust. The Tretto valley results from <b>selective</b> <b>erosion</b> of the relatively low resistant rocks underlying the Dolomia Principale. The north-dipping steep arcuate scarp delimiting towards the south the Tretto valley is a spectacular example of the control on the landscape exerted by inclined rocks with <b>selective</b> <b>erosion...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Ankarana is a {{limestone}} plateau in {{the northern}} part of Madagascar, where a cave system, more than 120 km long, has been explored. The plateau is bordered by volcanoes and is cut across by several canyons. An analysis of surface landforms and caves suggests that the karst genesis was probably initiated by volcanism beneath an impervious cover. Volcanic bulging and magma intrusions may have favored a basalt-limestone assimilation process and metamorphism. The ascent of deep volcanic fluids (CO 2 and SO 2) from magma degassing and from limestone metamorphism, may explain the speleogenesis.

40|$|The Uummannaq {{region is}} {{a mosaic of}} glacial landsystems, {{consistent}} with hypothesised landscape distribution resulting from variations in subglacial thermal regime. The region is dominated by <b>selective</b> linear <b>erosion</b> which has spatially and altitudinally partitioned the landscape. Low altitude areas are dominated by glacial scour, with higher elevations are dominated by plateaux or mountain valley and cirque glaciers. The appearance and nature of each landscape type varies locally with altitude and latitude, {{as a function of}} bedrock geology and average glacial conditions. <b>Selective</b> linear <b>erosion</b> has been a primary control on landscape distribution throughout Uummannaq, leading to plateau formation and the growth of a coalescent fjord system in the Uummannaq region. This has allowed the development of the Uummannaq ice stream’s (UIS) onset zone during glacial periods. Fjord development has been enhanced by a down-stream change in geology to less-resistant lithologies, increasing erosional efficiency and allowing a single glacial channel to develop, encouraging glacier convergence and the initiation of ice streaming. The landscape has been affected by several periods of regional uplift from 33 Ma to present, and has been subject to subsequent fluvial and glacial erosion. Uplift has removed surfaces from the impact of widespread warm-based glaciation, leaving them as relict landsurfaces. The result of this is a regional altitude-dependant continuum of glacial modification, with extreme differences in erosion between high and low elevation surfaces. This study indicates that processes of long-term uplift, glacial erosion/protection, and spatial variability in erosion intensity have produced a highly partitioned landscape...|$|R

40|$|Synergy {{tests were}} {{performed}} for two most common propeller materials, duplex stainless steel (DSS) and nickel aluminium bronze (NAB), {{by means of}} an indirect ultrasonic vibratory system. Tests were conducted for pure cavitation erosion in distilled water, pure corrosion using in situ electrochemistry under 3. 5 % NaCl solution and a combination of cavitation erosion–corrosion to understand the overall synergism existing between the two.

Alicona and Talysurf were employed for the surface topography, and scanning electron microscope was used to see the microstructural morphologies of the samples under different conditions. As a result, the electrochemical tests held at open circuit potential showed that, although DSS exhibited higher resistance to corrosion under seawater alone, NAB exhibited much higher resistance to corrosion when subjected to cavitation.

40|$|The {{identification}} of subglacial drainage systems can inform {{our understanding of}} past and present hydrological processes, landscape evolution, and ice dynamics. Here, we present evidence from satellite imagery, digital elevation models, and radio-echo sounding data for a series of channelized networks with contrasting paleofluvial and subglacial origins beneath Humboldt Glacier, northern Greenland. A > 250 -km-long, dendritic paleofluvial channel network beneath the northern portion of Humboldt is interpreted as a preglacial feature. Roughly linear channels beneath the southern portion of Humboldt, which display a similar distribution to tunnel valleys found on the beds of former ice sheets, are likely to have been eroded by subglacial meltwater routed along the ice-sheet bed. We suggest that basal meltwater is actively being routed down both the paleofluvial and subglacially formed channel networks to the coast. Inheritance of the preglacial channel network may have influenced the present-day location and dynamics of Humboldt Glacier and enhanced <b>selective</b> <b>erosion</b> at its down-glacier end. ...|$|E

Based on a discrete element modeling of non cohesive granular assemblies, specific micromechanical tools are developed in a unified framework to account for the two first steps of suffusion, namely the grain detachment and the grain transport processes. Thanks to the use of an enhanced force chain definition and autocorrelation functions the typical lengths scales associated with grain detachment are characterized. From the definition of transport paths based on a graph description of the pore space the typical lengths scales associated with grain transport are recovered. For a uniform grain size distribution, a separation of scales between these two processes exists for the finest particles of a soi...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{sediment}} supply {{relative to}} transport capacity In. e,ravel-bed streams lead to adjustments in stream geomorphology. Dietrich et al.

They developed a dimensionless bedload transport rate (q*), {{which is the}} ratio between the sediment transport rate of the surface layer and the transport rate of material as fine as the subsurface or bedload. Flume experiments show that q* approaches unity when supply meets or exceeds capacity, and decreases in value when supply decreases. Longitudinal profiles and crosssection surveys on 7 km of the North Fork American River, CA show a downstream increase in supply relative to transport capacity. Q* values calculated from 15 sediment samples show corresponding increases downstream, indicating that the q* method may be useful for detecting trends in the supply-capacity relationship.

The ability of X-ray printing to pattern thin or thick layers of photoresist with high resolution on non-planar surfaces of large and complex topographies with limited diffraction and scattering effects and no substrate reflection is known and can be exploited for patterning microsystems with non-planar 3 -D geometries as well as multisided and multilayered substrates.

40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{investigate}} {{the evolution of the}} subglacial landscape of Antarctica using an ice sheet and erosion model. We identify different stages of continental glaciation and model the erosion processes associated with each stage. The model links erosion to the basal thermal regime and indicates that much of the Antarctic interior may have been subject to less than 200 m of erosion. The depth of erosion reflects {{the presence or absence of}} warm-based ice and the consistency of ice flow direction. This information, linked with knowledge about landscapes of glaciation in the northern hemisphere and some simple but robust assumptions about initial topography, is used to generate a map of the subglacial Antarctic landscape in which much of the lowland interior resembles the landscapes of areal scouring typical of the Laurentian and Scandinavian shields. Near the continental margins <b>selective</b> linear <b>erosion</b> has overdeepened pre-existing river valleys by as much as 2. 8 km.

According to vertical changes in natural water content, fabric and varve thickness, four clay units were distinguished, reflecting {{a change in the}} sedimentary environment from ice-proximal to distal conditions. The varved clay complex is locally interrupted by a massive silty-clay unit, interpreted as an ice-drift material during the stagnation of the glacier margin at the Pandivere–Neva line. Varve correlation gave a 294 -year-long floating varve chronology. According to total varvethickness and the relation between thicknesses of seasonal layers, an about 130 -year period of ice-proximal conditions in the study area was followed by a rapid (within ca 20 years) change to more distal conditions.

40|$|Sediment {{generated}} by interrill erosion is commonly {{assumed to be}} enriched in soil organic carbon (SOC) compared to the source soil. However, the reported SOC enrichment ratios (ERSOC) vary widely. It is also noteworthy that most studies reported that the ERSOC is greater than unity, while conservation of mass dictates that the ERSOC of sediment must be balanced over time by a decline of SOC in the source area material. Although the effects of crusting on SOC erosion have been recognized, a systematic study on complete crust formation and interrill SOC erosion has not been conducted so far. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the effect of prolonged crust formation and its variability on the ERSOC of sediment. Two silty loams were simultaneously exposed to a rainfall simulation for 6 h. The ERSOC in sediment from both soils increased at first, peaked around the point when steady-state runoff was achieved and declined afterwards. The results show that crusting plays a crucial role in the ERSOC development over time and, in particular, that the conservation of mass applies to the ERSOC of sediment as a consequence of crusting. A “constant” ERSOC of sediment is therefore possibly biased, leading to an overestimation of SOC erosion. The results illustrate that the potential off-site effects of <b>selective</b> interrill <b>erosion</b> require considering the crusting effects on sediment properties in the specific context of the interaction between soil management, rainfall and erosion...|$|R

Furthermore, the findings suggest that landscapes of <b>selective</b> <b>erosion</b> exist further inland than might be expected, and may reflect the presence of thinner, less extensive ice in the past.

We apply analytical methods and an iterative model to solve for equilibrium slope-area and texture-area (in alluvial networks) relationships under different tectonic and climatic forcings.

In alluvial networks, it is well recognized that both channel slope and mean grain size usually decrease downstream.

One of the key advantages of RM over conventional machining is the elimination of molds, dies, and other forms of tooling, and the consequent eradication of tooling restrictions. Moreover, almost infinite geometrical complexity, mass customization, individualization and material flexibility give RM other superior properties. For RM to prosper, the limitations of existing additive processes must be overcome, e. g. limitations such as repeatability, reliability, surface finish, material properties and productivity. At the University of Leuven, selective laser melting/sintering (SLM/SLS) of metals, ceramics and polymers is studied aiming to develop the process to a level enabling RM of complex and customized parts in a competitive way. In order to achieve this overall goal, a monitoring and control system of SLM/SLS for metals is installed in an in-house developed machine to process metals.

40|$|Many {{sites of}} the Apulian coast (southern Italy) consist of {{carbonate}} rock cliffs affected by intense erosion and development of slope instabilities. Present morphology of the coastal cliffs was mostly produced by the quaternary tectonics, and the severe and <b>selective</b> action of <b>erosion</b> by sea waves. In addition, due to the carbonate nature of rock masses, the role exerted by development of karst processes has to be considered. The cliffs are involved in different types of landslides, with several, complex mechanisms of rock slope failure. Assessment of the overall slope stability, and evaluation of the potential hazard, {{are related to the}} morphologic, lithologic, and structural characteristics of the rock cliffs, and to local meteomarine condition and erosion by sea waves as well. This article provides a critical review of the common modes of failure in weathered and soft carbonatic rocks; the different theoretical formulations that allow predictions about the behavior of rock slopes are also examined. Examples of slope hazard indicators and mass movement typologies are in particular illustrated along a typical apulian area (stretch of Murgia coastline south of Bari) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{roles of}} climate and tectonics in mountain building {{have been widely}} debated. Central to this debate {{is the process of}} flexural uplift in response to valley incision. Here we quantify this process in the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains, a paradoxical tectonic feature in cratonic East Antarctica. Previous studies indicate that rifting and strike-slip tectonics may have provided a key trigger for the initial uplift of the Gamburtsevs, but the contribution of more recent valley incision remains to be quantified. Inverse spectral (free-air admittance and Bouguer coherence) methods indicate that, unusually for continents, the coherence between free-air gravity anomalies and bedrock topography is high (> 0. 5) and that the elastic thickness of the lithosphere is anomalously low (< 15 km), in contrast to previously reported values of up to ∼ 70 km. The isostatic effects of two different styles of erosion are quantified: dendritic fluvial incision overprinted by Alpine-style glacial erosion in the Gamburtsevs and outlet glacier-type <b>selective</b> linear <b>erosion</b> in the Lambert Rift, part of the East Antarctic Rift System. 3 D flexural models indicate that valley incision has contributed ca. 500 m of peak uplift in the Gamburtsevs and up to 1. 2 km in the Lambert Rift, which is consistent with the present-day elevation of Oligocene–Miocene glaciomarine sediments. Overall, we find that 17 – 25 % of Gamburtsev peak uplift can be explained by erosional unloading. These relatively low values are typical of temperate mountain ranges, suggesting that most of the valley incision in the Gamburtsevs occurred prior to widespread glaciation at 34 Ma. The pre-incision topography of the Gamburtsevs lies at 2 – 2. 5 km above sea-level, confirming that they were a key inception point {{for the development of the}} East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Tectonic and/or dynamic processes were therefore responsible for ca. 80 % of the elevation of the modern Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains. ©</p...|$|R
