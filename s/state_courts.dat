5|$|The Rialto Grain and Securities Company, whose {{principal}} {{place of}} business was in St. Louis, Missouri, was under investigation by the Postmaster for mail fraud. The Postmaster had received two complaints and forwarded them for investigation on November 7, 1902. <b>State</b> <b>courts</b> were also investigating complaints from investors against Rialto. Hugh C. Dennis, the President of Rialto, and other officers had been criminally indicted, but (at the time of Burton's indictment) none had been convicted. As of Burton's indictment, Dennis had been once acquitted in federal court and four indictments were pending against him in <b>state</b> <b>courts.</b> For a time, Rialto's offices had been closed due to a judicial attachment by its creditors.|$|E

5|$|The Virginia NAACP {{filed suit}} {{in federal court in}} 1956 to have the five barratry, champerty, and {{maintenance}} laws thrown out as an unconstitutional infringement of the 1st Amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. A three-judge panel of a U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia agreed that three of the laws were unconstitutional, but reserved judgment on the other two laws pending interpretation by <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> (which had not yet ruled on the laws' legality). Both the state and the NAACP appealed. In Harrison v. NAACP, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-to-3 that the district court should have withheld judgment until <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> had considered the issue first.|$|E

5|$|After the 2000 election, Fletcher {{crafted a}} {{compromise}} bill that allowed patients to sue their HMOs in federal court, capped {{pain and suffering}} awards at $500,000, and eliminated punitive damage awards. Despite an eventual compromise allowing patient lawsuits to go to <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> under certain circumstances and heavy lobbying in favor of Fletcher's bill by President George W. Bush, the House refused to pass it, favoring an alternative proposal by Georgia's Charlie Norwood that was less restrictive on patient lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection {{of some of the}} Bill of Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state and local governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E
5|$|During Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court had no general appellate {{jurisdiction}} in criminal cases. The Court could review criminal convictions from the <b>state</b> <b>courts,</b> {{but not the}} lower federal courts, via writs of error. It only did so twice. The Court could hear original habeas petitions, but disclaimed the authority to grant the writ post-conviction unless the sentence had already been completed. Thus, {{the majority of the}} Marshall Court's opinions on criminal law were issued in response to questions certified by divided panels of the circuit courts by a certificate of division.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of July 8, 2006, both houses of the {{legislature}} passed the proposed budget. At 6:00am that day, Corzine signed executive order number 19 to restore government services. The casinos in Atlantic City opened for business at 7:00am Remaining government services, including race tracks and the state lottery, also reopened on July 8, 2006. <b>State</b> <b>courts</b> and motor vehicle offices resumed normal operations on July 10, 2006, fully ending the shutdown.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's state {{government}} cannot operate without appropriations under law, as {{mandated by the}} Minnesota Constitution. However, <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> have determined that Priority One and Two Critical Services must continue {{in the event of}} a shutdown. Services that must remain uninterrupted to avoid a potential immediate threat to public health or safety are considered Priority One, and some additional services are designated Priority Two. Before the shutdown, a list of priority services was compiled and prepared by Minnesota Management and Budget, based on recommendations from state agencies.|$|E
5|$|Oregon’s <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> are {{courts of}} general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions of the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E

50|$|The plaintiffs {{noted that}} a case {{refining}} Pullman called Government and Civil Employees Organizing Committee, CIO v.

The plaintiffs therefore brought both claims in the Louisiana <b>state</b> <b>court</b> (as they believed Pullman and Windsor required). The <b>state</b> <b>court</b> found against them on both statutory and constitutional claims.|$|R
5000|$|After {{decades of}} debate, on November 18, 1988, Congress created the United <b>States</b> <b>Court</b> of Veterans Appeals.

5|$|The Marshall Court possessed {{jurisdiction}} {{in criminal cases}} only via writs of error from <b>state</b> <b>courts,</b> original writs of habeas corpus, and certificates of division from the circuit courts. In three cases involving certificates of division, the Marshall Court decided issues of double jeopardy, but did not clearly rely on the Double Jeopardy Clause. Similarly, the Marshall Court discussed the level of detail required for a sufficient indictment without explicitly citing the Information Clause of the Sixth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The Republican minor officeholders {{returned}} to the <b>state</b> <b>courts</b> with their case. Franklin County circuit court justice James E. Cantrill ruled against them, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then the state's court of last resort, sustained Cantrill's ruling {{by a vote of}} 4–3. Republican Attorney General Clifton J. Pratt continued with legal challenges and finally was allowed to serve out his term. Though Cantrill's decision was based on the invalidation of Louisville's vote and the votes of four counties in eastern Kentucky, none of the legislators from those areas were unseated.|$|E
5|$|The Vicinage clause has {{its roots}} in medieval English {{criminal}} procedure, the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period and Anti-federalist objections to the United States Constitution.

The United <b>States</b> federal <b>court</b> system consists of 94 federal judicial districts. The 94 districts are then divided into twelve regional circuits.
