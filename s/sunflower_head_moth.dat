40|$|The {{sunflower}} moth, Homoeosoma electellum (Hulst), a major pest of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), is {{susceptible to}} Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner, but field control has been inconsistent. Our study was done to determine whether phenolics in damaged sunflower tissue are in a conjugated or free form and whether they influence the toxicity of B. thuringiensis to the sunflower moth. Larvae fed diets containing B. thuringiensis had reduced survival and growth. The LD 50 of B. thuringiensis was 52 international units of potency per gram of diet. Phenolic acids are general biocides. They were found in sunflower hybrids largely in the free (nonconjugated) form after tissue injury. The phenolics were probably converted from the conjugated form to the free form after release of glycosidases. By themselves and at the doses tested, specific phenolic acids did not affect sunflower moth survival and growth. When cinnamic or p-coumaric acids were combined with B. thuringiensis in artificial diet, growth (measured as width of <b>sunflower</b> <b>moth</b> <b>head</b> capsules) of larvae was reduced {{compared with that of}} larvae fed diets containing B. thuringiensis. High phenolic sunflower might increase the effectiveness of B. thuringiensis as an agent for sunflower moth control...|$|R

40|$|The sunßower midge, Contarinia schulzi Gagne (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), is a pest of {{cultivated}} sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). Larval feeding {{can cause}} damage and yield {{loss to the}} <b>sunflower</b> <b>head.</b> Adult emergence is extended and larvae are well protected in the sunflower receptacle, making chemical control methods difficult and expensive. Sunflower midge enter sunflower fields at the edges but fieldwide distributions occur, although the dynamics are not fully understood. Two commercial fields in 1999 and one field in 2000 were systematically sampled by dividing each field into fixed sample points. Mean egg and larval densities from each sample point were used to describe sunflower midge populations. The <b>sunflower</b> <b>heads</b> at each sample point were also assessed for damage. Maps of sunflower midge population density, cumulative density, and <b>sunflower</b> <b>head</b> damage ratings were estimated with kriging interpolation. Maps were estimated several times during first generation sunflower midge infestation. Field edges that were initially populated continued to be areas of infestation throughout the sampling period.

The increased level in the production of pectinases was noticed when the agrowastes were supplemented with additional carbon and nitrogen sources, and supplementation of sucrose was more effective than glucose in SSF.

40|$|Anthraquinone is an {{effective}} chemical seed repellent that protects newly planted crops from depredation by granivorous birds. We are experimenting with foliar applications of 9, 10 -anthraquinone (AQ) to reduce blackbird (Icteridae) damage to ripening <b>sunflower.</b> <b>Sunflower</b> <b>heads</b> generally turn downward as the achenes mature. With the methods currently available for spraying crops, application of AQ directly onto sunflower achenes is nearly impossible. Blackbirds sometimes remove sunflower bracts prior to eating achenes. Thus, getting AQ droplets directly on the achenes may not be necessary, and spraying the heads should expose blackbirds to AQ as they remove bracts. Studies using caged red-winged blackbirds showed that AQ sprayed onto the backs of <b>sunflower</b> <b>heads</b> reduced damage. However, field trials using fixed-wing aerial sprayers and ground sprayers produced inconclusive results. We are currently experimenting with methods to increase spray coverage of AQ while simultaneously attempting to reduce AQ contamination of achenes, thus reducing the likelihood of having to establish food tolerance limits for this comparatively long-lived compound. In this paper, we summarize results from several AQ studies and speculate on when a repellent might be available for sunflower producers...|$|R

50|$|Rhizopus microsporus is {{similarly}} {{one of three}} common Rhizopus species to cause the disease Rhizopus Head Rot in confectionery sunflower species. Alongside R. oryzae, R. microsporus causes the premier <b>head</b> rot of <b>sunflower</b> in South Africa. Susceptibility to disease changes throughout {{the age of the}} host. The initial symptoms appear as small, dispersed water-soaked spots {{on the back of the}} <b>sunflower</b> <b>head.</b> As the spots expand, mycelial growth expands into parenchyma cells, further killing cells within the head.

50|$|The {{life cycle}} of R. microsporus is quite similar to the general life cycles of common Rhizopus species.The primary feature as a plant {{pathogen}} is the intake of resources from a plant host.

40|$|Low-methoxyl pectin was {{extracted}} from <b>sunflower</b> <b>heads</b> and head-stalk mixtures (1 : 1, w/w) and modified either {{during or after}} isolation, by NH 4 OH demethylation. The number of processing steps was reduced substantially by modification during pectin isolation. The poor gelation characteristics of native sunflower pectins (pregelation, brittleness and lack of elasticity) were improved by NH 4 OH demethylation, especially with head pectins. The NH 4 OH treatments were effective in reducing the methoxyl, acetyl, and ash contents, and molecular weight, and in increasing the acid amide and galacturonic acid contents. It was presumed that the improved gelation characteristics were related to these changes in chemical composition, and to greater randomization of methoxyl and carboxyl groups along the polygalaturonic acid chains. For demethylation of rehydrated pectins, a high demethylation rate and high amidation efficiency were associated {{with a high degree}} of hydration of pectin particles, high NH 4 OH concentrations, and low temperature. For demethylation of pectin extracts and pectin precipitates, a high demethylation rate and high amidation efficiency were again associated with high concentrations of NH 4 OH and low temperature. The extent of demethylation and amidation were dependent upon reaction time, NH 4 OH concentration, and temperature. Reductions in molecular weight proceeded at a slower rate at higher concentrations of NH 4 OH and a low reaction temperature.

Sunflower hybrid S- 278 was planted in randomized complete block design with four replications. Each head was divided into three equal circles (outer, middle and central) at maturity, thereafter, oil and fatty acid distribution was separately determined in each circle. Oil and fatty acid accumulated in three circles differed significantly. Outer circle accumulated higher oil content during spring which decreased to the minimum in central circle while, autumn season showed contrasting results in which oil contents progressively increased from outer to central circle. The maximum oleic acid was observed in outer circle which decreased to minimum in central circle during the both spring and autumn seasons, however, linoleic acid consistently increased from outer to central circle during both the seasons. Thus, oleic and linoleic acid depicted inverse relation with circles.
