5|$|The {{film was}} chosen among 15 debut {{works for the}} 2006 Berlin Film Festival. It {{received}} enthusiastic reception from the audience as it ran to packed houses to the Chopra's surprise. Expecting an audience of about 100 Westerners, a critic visiting the festival was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> cinema hall full and people jostling for seats even on the steps.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Raglan wished to {{reinforce}} the Turks and British infantry, and ordered Lucan to detach {{four of the five}} Heavy Brigade cavalry regiments and send them to the defensive line. This further angered Lucan, since splitting the force in half merely reduced the cavalry's overall effectiveness, but he again complied. The result was that the first fork of the Russian cavalry attack encountered The Thin Red Line and were driven off, while the second fork, crossing the heights above the plain, encountered four regiments of the Heavy Brigade. The Russians – with between 1,500 and 2,000 men – were initially <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> 800 British cavalry approaching, allowing Scarlett, the commander of the Heavy Brigades, to charge the Russians uphill. By this point Lucan had left Lord Cardigan in charge of the Light Brigade and raced over to the Heavies, later claiming that his duty trumpeter had ordered the British charge, which eventually forced the Russians to flee.|$|E
5|$|In early December 1808, Topaze {{departed}} Brest and travelled {{across the}} Atlantic, encountering the British frigate HMS Loire in the Bay of Biscay. Loire fired on Topaze, {{but was unable}} to catch her and, despite minor damage, the French ship was able to reach the Caribbean without further incident. Nearing Cayenne on 13 January 1809, Lahalle was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> small British ship HMS Confiance emerge from the harbour and manoeuvre threateningly towards his ship. Realising that Cayenne was in British hands, he turned and sailed northwards, concerned that stronger British forces might be nearby. In fact Confiance was the only British ship in the vicinity and she was severely underarmed, with a crew of just 47 men, including 20 local inhabitants recruited on the spot. The colony had been captured just three days earlier by a combined British and Portuguese expeditionary force under Captain James Lucas Yeo.|$|E
60|$|Turning to {{face this}} new danger, she was startled into a little cry of <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> head and {{shoulders}} of the mucker framed in the broken square of the half-demolished window.|$|R
60|$|He pondered a moment, then {{climbed up}} in front of Mescal, and {{directed}} the gray out upon the valley. Soon he was among the grazing cattle. He felt no <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> H brand on their flanks.|$|R
60|$|But when Mark {{hastened to}} congratulate him, {{what was his}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> poor fellow clasp his hands and raise them to Heaven, while an {{expression}} of pain--very different from that resulting from physical suffering--convulsed his features.|$|R
5|$|Eragon is a fifteen-year-old boy who {{has lived}} with his uncle Garrow and cousin Roran (Roran Stronghammer) on a farm {{near the village of}} Carvahall, ever since his mother Selena, Garrow's sister, left him there right after his birth. While hunting in the Spine, Eragon is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> blue dragon egg, which he {{believes}} to be a stone, appear in front of him. A few months later, Eragon witnesses a baby dragon hatch from the egg. Eragon names the dragon Saphira. He raises the dragon in secret until two of King Galbatorix's servants, the Ra'zac, come to Carvahall; though it is later revealed that they weren't looking for the egg at first. Eragon and Saphira manage to escape by hiding in the Spine, but Garrow is fatally wounded and the house and farm are burned down by the Ra'zac. Once Garrow dies, Eragon is left with no reason to stay in Carvahall, so he goes after the Ra'zac with his newly hatched dragon, seeking vengeance for the destruction of his home and his uncle's death. He is accompanied by Brom, an elderly storyteller, who provides Eragon with the sword Zar'roc and insists on helping him and Saphira.|$|E
5|$|The ice trade {{enabled the}} {{consumption}} {{of a wide range}} of new products during the 19th century. One simple use for natural ice was to chill drinks, either being directly added to the glass or barrel, or indirectly chilling it in a wine cooler or similar container. Iced drinks were a novelty and were initially viewed with concern by customers, worried about the health risks, although this rapidly vanished in the US. By mid-19th century, water was always chilled in America if possible. Iced milk also popular, and German lager, traditionally drunk chilled, also used ice. Drinks such as sherry-cobblers and mint juleps were created that could only be made using crushed ice. There were distinct differences in 19th-century American and European attitudes to adding ice directly to drinks, with the Europeans regarding this as an unpleasant habit; British visitors to India were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Indian elite prepared to drink iced water. Some Hindus in India regarded ice as unclean for religious reasons, and as such an inappropriate food.|$|E
25|$|Series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone {{said that}} they were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Steve Irwin {{depiction}} cause so much controversy, essentially since they felt South Park has featured far more offensive material.|$|E
50|$|Dale Watkins, Adie Mings {{and record}} signing David Holmes formed {{one of the}} most potent front lines in non-league {{football}} and it was no <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Tigers battling on all fronts. Despite having to play manager Leroy Rosenior in goal against Kingstonian in their first game in the FA Trophy, City managed to reach the semi-final before being beaten by Dagenham & Redbridge after a dramatic replay.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{they came}} {{opposite}} our station; nor was I <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>the</b> two were Lakor and his companion of the guardroom.|$|R
60|$|Fishermen {{were at work}} in a boat out in mid-stream, heaving their nets to {{the sound}} of the oddest cantilena, and I was all for pausing there to watch their operations. But Arcolano urged me onward with that impatience of his which took no account of my very natural curiosity. Presently I drew rein again with exclamations of delight and <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> {{wonderful}} bridge of boats that spanned the river a little higher up.|$|R
25|$|By October 2007 the Hsu matter had quieted down. Clinton's {{third quarter}} {{campaign}} expenditures report showed the $800,000 in contributions, mostly Hsu-related, being returned {{to more than}} 200 donors, {{some of whom were}} <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> money coming back and who said they knew not of Hsu.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the show}} Alez Ruiz Glez, writer for the Mexican SuperLuchas Magazine stated that the show looked very {{attractive}} and he would expect good matches, especially the Apuesta matches. The Cub's Fan of the Luchablog website was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> tag team Luchas de Apuestas match as the main event since it was usually featured in {{the second or third}} match of the shows leading up to Homenaje a Dos Leyendas.|$|E
25|$|Mattingly and Aaron {{struggle}} {{to find a way}} to turn on the Command Module systems without drawing too much power, and finally transmit the procedure to Swigert, who restarts Odyssey by transferring extra power from Aquarius. When the crew jettisons the Service Module, they are <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> extent of the damage. As they release Aquarius and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, no one is sure that Odysseys heat shield is intact. The tense period of radio silence due to ionization blackout is longer than normal, but the astronauts report all is well and splash down in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

30|$|It {{is also no}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>the</b> MLE reduces to BLUE, {{which is}} often applied in {{centralized}} estimation [14], where the FC can obtain all raw observations of the sensors.|$|R

25|$|Finally, {{the journey}} to Russia happens, Gautham reaches Moscow, and completes his {{immigration}} procedures. Incidentally, Gautham meets Anna (Maria Kozhevnikova), and unknowingly, the lady drops her jacket, which is seen by Gautham. He has no time to return the jacket and exits from the Moscow airport accompanied by his medical team. Gautham is flabbergasted by the roads and buildings {{of the city and}} is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> city of Moscow from his hotel view. Gautham learns that the only hiccup with Russians is that the people are ignorant about the English language and the whole conversation with them must be made in Russian national language.|$|E
25|$|As {{leader of}} {{division}} Red 5 of VF-6, Vorse regularly flew CAP {{and had a}} number of memorable sorties during the month of August. In fact the very first day of combat, 7 August, he would launch three times: initially to run SCAP (air patrol for the transport screen) at 0642 hours, then CAP at 1015, and finally an attack flight sent up at around 1320 in which he ran headlong into an enemy bomber formation. Vorse's section was headed for Tulagi at the time and was so <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> three-plane section of Val dive bombers from 5th Air Attack Force's 2nd Air Group that they almost flew past them. Only Vorse acted quickly enough to chase the Vals into their diving run, snapping at the heels of the trailing plane and ultimately flaming it before it could unleash its payload.|$|E
25|$|The next year, {{although}} the Islanders had won three straight Stanley Cups, more attention was {{being paid to}} the upstart Edmonton Oilers, whose young superstar Wayne Gretzky had just shattered existing scoring records. The 1982–83 season was thus a battle to decide which was {{the best team in}} the NHL. The Oilers had a better regular season, but the Islanders swept them in the Stanley Cup finals to win their fourth straight championship. Billy Smith was named the Most Valuable Player of the Playoffs after shutting down the Oilers' vaunted scoring machine. Gretzky failed to score a goal during the series. The Sutter brothers, Duane and Brent, scored 7 and 5 points respectively in the first 3 games, while Bossy again scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in game four. After that game, the Oilers players walked past the Islanders' dressing room and were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> champions exhausted. Oilers players such as Gretzky and Mark Messier said that they realized at that moment how much it would actually take to win the Stanley Cup.|$|E
25|$|Occupy {{began in}} Mexico City on 11 October 2011, with {{a hunger strike}} {{in front of the}} Mexican Stock Exchange highrise. Edur Velasco, a 56-year-old labor {{economist}} and university professor, was on a 42-day-long hunger strike sitting in a tent outside Mexico City's stock market, demanding that the government guarantee greater access to higher education among the youth. Days after his initiative, it came as a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> multiplication of tents setting up outside the stock exchange building. Police remained discreetly around the corner sitting in their trucks.|$|R
60|$|After {{settling}} Mrs. Bunter {{in a good}} {{hotel in}} Dunkirk, I {{walked down to the}} docks--late afternoon it was--and what was my <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> ship actually fast alongside. Either Johns or Bunter, or both, must have been driving her hard up Channel. Anyway, she had been in since the day before last, and her crew was already paid off. I met two of her apprenticed boys going off home on leave with their dunnage on a Frenchman's barrow, as happy as larks, and I asked them if the mate was on board.|$|R
50|$|Vinod's {{business}} now {{stands as a}} threat to Vardhan's empire. Soon, Raja returns after completing his education and meets Vinod and is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>the</b> latter's lifestyle has changed, but doesn't know the truth.|$|R
500|$|When Nürnberg and Gneisenau {{approached}} the islands early on 8 December, the old battleship Canopus opened fire and drove them off. The Germans were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> warships in the harbor, and Spee decided to retreat. The East Asia Squadron steamed away at [...] {{in a single}} file line; Nürnberg was the second ship in the line, between Gneisenau and Scharnhorst. Sturdee ordered his ships to raise steam and pursue the Germans. His battlecruisers caught up and opened fire at 12:50; Spee decided that he could hold off the battlecruisers with Scharnhorst and Gneisenau to allow the three light cruisers time to escape. In response, Sturdee sent his light cruisers to chase down Nürnberg, Dresden, and Leipzig.|$|E
500|$|E.W. Swanton {{wrote that}} this [...] "could {{well have been}} so for {{he was a man}} of quixotic mood and temperament". However the England bowler, Alec Bedser wrote [...] "It was when I was bowling to Sid at Sydney that I first {{discovered}} that I could move the ball to leg by use of my wrist and fingers...I held the ball in the same manner as a leg-break bowler with the fingers across the seam...and on pitching I was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> ball go away like a leg-break. It also surprised Sid Barnes". This would make Barnes the first batsman to be dismissed by Bedser's [...] "Special Ball" [...] which would claim Bradman for a duck in the Fourth Test at Adelaide.|$|E
500|$|Blane {{was amazed}} by the {{recreation}} and understanding of her designs by fans. When she first heard that people were dressing up, {{she thought it would}} be tacky, but was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> depth to which the fans went to recreate her designs. Rocky Horror fan Mina Credeur, who designs costumes and performed as Columbia for Houston’s performance group, states that [...] "the best part is when everyone leaves with a big smile on their face", noting that there's [...] "such a kitschiness and campiness that it seems to be winking at you". The film still plays at many theatre locations and Rocky Horror costumes are often made for Halloween, although many require much time and effort to make.|$|E
60|$|All {{watched the}} {{approach}} of the big sleigh, and were then <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>the</b> turnout contained the four Germans they had met before, and likewise Tony Duval and a sixth man, who was a stranger to them.|$|R
6000|$|Meantime the dog had, {{after several}} days of neglect, forced an egress through a window, and a {{neighbouring}} baker {{received a call from}} him daily. Walking gravely in, he would deposit a piece of silver, and receiving a roll and his change would march off homeward. As this was a rather unusual proceeding in a cur of his species, the baker one day followed him, and as the dog leaped joyously into the window of the deserted house, the man of dough approached and looked in. What was his <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> dog deposit his bread calmly upon the floor and fall to tenderly licking the face of a beautiful child! ...|$|R

500|$|Both Jocelyn Vena from MTV and Christian Blauvelt from Entertainment Weekly {{commented on}} the {{similarity}} of the music video with the Broadway musical, Rent. Vena also compared the visuals with those for Madonna's 1986 single [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] and Michael Jackson's 1984 single, [...] "Billie Jean". She concluded {{by saying that the}} music video [...] "still manages to shine, mostly because of its simplicity". In another review, James Montgomery from MTV, also found similarities between the video and the musicals Rent and West Side Story. Blauvelt was initially <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> simplistic approach of the video, since her previous releases had provocative visuals. He added that the video seemed a [...] "clear homage" [...] to Gaga's inspirations like Madonna, concluding that [...] "all the references in 'The Edge of Glory' are so overt, there's no way it could be shameless cribbing." ...|$|E
500|$|One year later, Sally and Larry {{have opened}} a {{combined}} book and DVD store. Sally insists on keeping a folder of the events, including Larry's completed transcript, but Larry {{wants her to}} move on and indicates he has feelings for her. Sally gently rebuffs him and Larry steps out on an errand. Sally sees the Doctor and Martha hurriedly leave a taxi in front of the shop and goes outside to meet them. They don't recognise her and she realises that they have yet to experience the events that sent them to the past. She hands the Doctor the folder, warning him that he will need it in his future. The Doctor and Sally say goodbye as Larry returns, <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> man from the Easter egg. Sally and Larry return to the shop hand in hand, hinting that she is now ready for a romantic relationship. The episode ends with a repeat of the Doctor's [...] "don't blink" [...] warning to Sally, this time directed at the viewer and overlaid with flashes of famous statues.|$|E
500|$|On October 27, {{both men}} {{appeared}} before police magistrate A. H. Gibson for their preliminary {{hearings on the}} criminal libel charge (the counselling to murder charge had been dropped). Unwin opted for a jury trial, while Powell elected to be tried by a judge alone. Unwin's trial proceeded first, on November 12. He testified that he had ordered the pamphlets, which were {{paid for by the}} government, and then circulated them as a publication of the [...] "United Democrats", a fictitious organization that listed its address as that of Unwin's home. According to Unwin, the leaflet's text, minus the named individuals, had been provided to him by Powell, he had sent it to the printer's in exactly that form, and he was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> list of names in the final version. [...] Though his testimony was vague and apparently evasive, he admitted to destroying 4,000 copies of the leaflet {{on the day of the}} police raid. [...] He was convicted and Ives, dismissing his role in the affair as that of an [...] "errand boy", sentenced him to three months hard labour.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 23 December 1933, {{sub-prefect}} Anthelme received Gustave Tissier, {{the director of the}} Crédit Municipal de Bayonne. He responded well, with some astonishment, to his persistent interview. It did not <b>surprise</b> him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> man unpacking what became the scam of the century.|$|R
50|$|After knowing this, Wangmu Niang Niang {{captured}} the dog.
