5|$|The abdomen is {{the section}} behind the metathorax, {{made up of}} a series of rings, each with a hole for {{breathing}} and respiration, called a <b>spiracle,</b> composing three different segmented sclerites: the tergum, pleura, and the sternum. The tergum in almost all species is membranous, or usually soft and concealed by the wings and elytra when not in flight. The pleura are usually small or hidden in some species, with each pleuron having a single <b>spiracle.</b> The sternum is the most widely visible part of the abdomen, being a more or less sclerotized segment. The abdomen itself does not have any appendages, but some (for example, Mordellidae) have articulating sternal lobes.|$|E
5|$|The thorax bears {{three pairs}} of legs, one pair on each segment. The {{prothorax}} (T1) has a functional <b>spiracle</b> which is actually derived from the mesothorax (T2) while the metathorax has a reduced <b>spiracle</b> which is not externally open and lies beneath the cuticle. The thoracic legs consist of coxa, trochanter, femur, tarsus and claw and are constant in form throughout the order. However they are reduced {{in the case of}} certain leaf-miners and elongated in certain Notodontidae. In Micropterigidae, the legs are three-segmented, as the coxa, trochanter and femur are fused.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is hard}} to {{test the}} hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can {{possibly}} hear prey from many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the <b>spiracle)</b> leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost.|$|E
40|$|Oxygen lack {{causes a}} {{reduction}} in the frequency of motor impulses to the closer muscles of the <b>spiracles</b> of certain African dragonfiies (Miller, 1962). This results in fluttering and opening of the valves. The decreased frequency also probably makes the <b>spiracles</b> more sensitive to carbon dioxide.

5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark has an elongated body, {{over half of}} which is comprised by the slender caudal peduncle. The snout is short and rounded, with the nares placed almost at the tip along {{with a pair of}} tiny barbels; there are grooves running from the nares to the mouth. There are 2635 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2132 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small, with broad bases and triangular cusps. The eyes are oval in shape and elevated, with a large <b>spiracle</b> below each. The five pairs of gill slits are small, with the fourth and fifth very close together.|$|E
5|$|The Anura {{include all}} modern frogs and any fossil species that fit within the anuran definition. The {{characteristics}} of anuran adults include: 9 or fewer presacral vertebrae, {{the presence of}} a urostyle formed of fused vertebrae, no tail, a long and forward-sloping ilium, shorter fore limbs than hind limbs, radius and ulna fused, tibia and fibula fused, elongated ankle bones, absence of a prefrontal bone, presence of a hyoid plate, a lower jaw without teeth (with the exception of Gastrotheca guentheri) consisting of three pairs of bones (angulosplenial, dentary, and mentomeckelian, with the last pair being absent in Pipoidea), an unsupported tongue, lymph spaces underneath the skin, and a muscle, the protractor lentis, attached to the lens of the eye. The anuran larva or tadpole has a single central respiratory <b>spiracle</b> and mouthparts consisting of keratinous beaks and denticles.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} Izak {{catshark}} is {{firm and}} stout, tapering dramatically towards the tail. The head is very short, wide, and flattened, with a blunt snout. The horizontally oval eyes are placed high {{on the head and}} have thick ridges beneath; each has a rudimentary nictitating membrane and is followed by a <b>spiracle.</b> The nostrils are preceded by triangular flaps of skin that almost reach the long, angular mouth. The mouth contains prominent papillae on both the roof and the floor, and lacks furrows at the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain on average 65 and 60 tooth rows respectively; each tooth is relatively large, with a narrow central cusp flanked by 1–2 smaller cusplets. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of anterograde airflow in a flightless dung beetle has brought {{into question the}} accepted role of the mesothoracic <b>spiracles,</b> abdominal <b>spiracles</b> and subelytral cavity in respiration in beetles (Duncan and Byrne, 2002). At rest, Circellium bacchus (Fabricius), a large flightless scarab from the East coast of South Africa, releases CO 2 and H 2 O from the abdominal <b>spiracles</b> into the subelytral cavity where they are held {{for an extended period}} before being released through the more anterior mesothoracic <b>spiracles</b> (Byrne and Duncan, 2003). Tenebrionid beetles from other arid regions of the world also use the mesothoracic <b>spiracles</b> for CO 2 emission (Lighton, 1991; Duncan, 2003), supporting the assumption that this respiratory pattern, coupled with flightlessness and the possession of a sealed subelytral cavity are adaptations to an arid habitat, although other interpretations of its function hav...|$|R
50|$|In {{the tribe}} Notiphilini {{the head is}} reduced to a cephalic skeleton, there are no {{anterior}} <b>spiracles</b> and the posterior <b>spiracles</b> are extended as spines. The other taxa have larvae similar to the Sciomyzidae, with the posterior <b>spiracles</b> at the apices of divergent branches from a common base. They may be differentiated by short thoracic segments (like the abdominal ones) and {{by the absence of}} a ventral arch linking the mouth hooks.|$|R
40|$|In Drosophila, the cephalic gap gene empty <b>spiracles</b> plays {{key roles}} in {{embryonic}} patterning of the peripheral and central nervous system. During postembryonic development, it {{is involved in}} the development of central olfactory circuitry in the antennal lobe of the adult. However, its possible role in the postembryonic development of peripheral olfactory sense organs has not been investigated. Here, we show that empty <b>spiracles</b> acts in a subset of precursors that generate the olfactory sense organs of the adult antenna. All empty spiracles-expressing precursor cells co-express the proneural gene amos and the early patterning gene lozenge. Moreover, the expression of empty <b>spiracles</b> in these precursor cells is dependent on both amos and lozenge. Functional analysis reveals two distinct roles of empty <b>spiracles</b> in the development of olfactory sense organs. Genetic interaction studies in a lozenge-sensitized background uncover a requirement of empty <b>spiracles</b> in the formation of trichoid and basiconic olfactory sensilla. MARCM-based clonal mutant analysis reveals an additional role during axonal targeting of olfactory sensory neurons to glomeruli within the antennal lobe. Our findings on empty <b>spiracles</b> action in olfactory sense organ development complement previous studies that demonstrate its requirement in olfactory interneurons and, taken together with studies on the murine homologs of empty <b>spiracles,</b> suggest that conserved molecular genetic programs might be responsible for the formation of both peripheral and central olfactory circuitry in insects and mammals...|$|R
5|$|The slender smooth-hound has a {{very thin}} body and a broad, highly {{flattened}} head. The snout is long, with a distinctive bell-shaped outline when viewed from above. The eyes have an elongate horizontal oval shape, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Beneath each eye is a prominent ridge, and behind is a much smaller <b>spiracle.</b> The nostrils are preceded by small, almost triangular flaps of skin. The line of the mouth forms an angle; there are very short furrows at the mouth corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 96–99 and 108–114 rows respectively of small, very closely spaced teeth; each tooth has a narrow upright central cusp flanked by smaller cusplets on both sides. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
5|$|The woodlice, {{suborder}} Oniscidea, are {{the most}} successful group of terrestrial crustaceans and show various adaptations for life on land. They are subject to evaporation, especially from their ventral area, and as {{they do not have}} a waxy cuticle, they need to conserve water, often living in a humid environment and sheltering under stones, bark, debris or leaf litter. Desert species are usually nocturnal, spending the day in an underground burrow and emerging at night. Moisture is obtained through food sources or by drinking, and some species can form their paired uropodal appendages into a tube and funnel water from dewdrops onto their pleopods. In many taxa, the respiratory structures on the endopods are internal, with a <b>spiracle</b> and pseudotrachaea, which resemble lungs. In others, the endopod is folded inside the adjoining exopod (outer branch of the pleopod). Both these arrangements help to prevent evaporation from the respiratory surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} position of eyes is highly variable within the species. For example, eye location ranges from being completely within the antennal scrobes to completely outside the scrobes. In {{some cases the}} eye itself is located outside the antennal scrobe, but the eye's fossa is well marked and confluent with the antennal scrobe. In most specimens, the antennal carina (ridge extending along the dorsal antennal region) bifurcates from the antennal scrobes and lies straight above the eyes. However, in specimens from Nicaragua, a strongly impressed antennal carina is present. In these specimens about 40% of the eye's area lies within the antennal scrobes. In the gyne, only ~1/6 of the eye lies within the antennal scrobes. A depression sometimes forms in the integument in {{the sides of the}} propodeum, below the propodeal <b>spiracle</b> and above the metapleural gland. The depth of this depression varies among specimens and tends to be deepest in larger specimens.|$|E
50|$|The larva of the centaurus beetle has a dark row of spots {{which is}} visible {{along the side}} of its body, known as the <b>spiracles.</b> These are {{openings}} leading to its tracheal network, which is the insect equivalent of the vertebrate lung. The <b>spiracles</b> could be considered as the insect version of nostrils. <b>Spiracles</b> are also present in the adult beetle and located along the sides of the abdomen; however, they have no distinct color and quite unnoticeable.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{posterior}} <b>spiracles</b> of laboratory-reared fourth instar larvae of Lutzomyia longipalpis, L. migonei, L. lenti, and L. whitmani (Diptera: Psychodidae) of the State of Ceará, Brazil, were examined under scanning electron microscopy. The number of papillae of <b>spiracles</b> examined varied {{according to the}} species examined, but no intraspecific differences were found. The importance of this structure to sand fly larva identification and phylogeny is commented. Key words: phlebotomine sand fly larvae- spiracle- scanning electron microscopy- Ceará- Brazil Phlebotomine sand fly larvae are amphipneustic, having a pair of small anterior <b>spiracles</b> and an-other slightly larger pair of posterior <b>spiracles.</b> Al-though identification to species of sand fly larvae has been attempted using chaetotaxy (Ward 1976), this method is time-consuming {{and a number of}} alternative schemes have been proposed (Leite & Williams 1996). Recently, the larval <b>spiracles</b> have been considered as a possible tool for immature identification and might be a useful feature for grouping species by subgenus or species-group, or to distinguish among species within the same group (Fausto et al. 1998, 1999). In the present study, posterior <b>spiracles</b> of three specimens of fourth instar larvae from the following laboratory colonies were examined: Lutzomyia longipalpi...|$|R

5|$|Tiktaalik {{generally}} had {{the characteristics}} of a lobe-finned fish, but with front fins featuring arm-like skeletal structures more akin to those of a crocodile, including a shoulder, elbow, and wrist. The fossil discovered in 2004 did not include the rear fins and tail. It had rows of sharp teeth indicative of a predator fish, and its neck could move independently of its body, which is not common in other fish (Tarrasius, Mandageria, placoderms, and extant seahorses being some exceptions; see also Lepidogalaxias and Channallabes apus). The animal had a flat skull resembling a crocodile's; eyes on top of its head, suggesting that it {{spent a lot of time}} looking up; a neck and ribs similar to those of tetrapods, with the ribs being used to support its body and aid in breathing via lungs; well developed jaws suitable for catching prey; and a small gill slit called a <b>spiracle</b> that, in more derived animals, became an ear.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tadpole phase, {{hind legs}} appear, {{followed}} by front limbs, and the phase ends when the front limbs are developed. This normally occurs between October and April due to the breeding season, but tadpoles been observed in the wild throughout the year, suggesting some tadpoles overwinter; this has been seen to occur for captive tadpoles. The length of the tadpole stage, in the wild and in captivity, is usually between 10 and 12 weeks, but can range from five weeks to a year. The slower-growing tadpoles usually progress during winter, as there is a positive correlation between growth rates and temperatures. Variation in growth rate across pH values of 4, 7 and 9 was insignificant. In the first four weeks, there was no significant dependence of the growth rate across the 18–26°C range, but from this point on, growth was significantly hindered at 18°C. At the beginning of the metamorphing stage, all limbs are present and developed, along with a tail. During this phase, the tail is resorbed, and the only other visible change is the <b>spiracle</b> closing. Metamorphing tadpoles typically have a SVL of 22–28mm, and will complete metamorphosis between two and 11 months, depending on the temperature of the water and available food. The process is slowed at low temperatures, but generally takes between three and eight days after the tadpole stage is complete. Breeding occurs in a significantly higher proportion of sites where no predatory fish are present, and water bodies are ephemeral rather than permanent. Populations in Victoria, however, have been recorded as breeding in permanent ponds as readily as they do in ephemeral ponds.|$|E
25|$|First instar Sarcophagidae larvae are 0.5 to 5.0 {{millimeters}} long. The Sarcophaginae larvae, specifically, usually lack a labral sclerite, but in {{some cases}} it is present as a small, triangular plate located between the mandibles. The first segment is at times sclerotized on the dorsal surface, which can form a partial head capsule. The Sarcophaginae have a hypopharyngeal sclerite that is sometimes fused with the large tentoropharyngeal sclerite. They also lack an anterior <b>spiracle,</b> while the posterior <b>spiracle</b> usually consists of two lobes; rarely it may be bispinose.|$|E

25|$|Unlike many {{dolphins}} and whales, {{the seven}} vertebrae {{in the neck}} are not fused together, allowing the animal to turn its head laterally without needing to rotate its body. This gives the head a lateral manoeuvrability that allows an improved field of view and movement and helps in catching prey and evading predators in deep water. The rostrum has about eight to 10 small, blunt, and slightly curved teeth {{on each side of}} the jaw and a total of 36 to 40 teeth. Belugas do not use their teeth to chew, but for catching hold of their prey; they then tear them up and swallow them nearly whole. Belugas only have a single <b>spiracle,</b> which is located on the top of the head behind the melon, and has a muscular covering, allowing it to be completely sealed. Under normal conditions, the <b>spiracle</b> is closed and an animal must contract the muscular covering to open the <b>spiracle.</b> A beluga's thyroid gland is larger than that of terrestrial mammals – weighing three times more than that of a horse – which helps it to maintain a greater metabolism during the summer when it lives in river estuaries. It is the marine cetacean that most frequently develops hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions of the thyroid.|$|E
25|$|As predators, centipedes mainly {{use their}} {{antennae}} {{to seek out}} their prey. The digestive tract forms a simple tube, with digestive glands attached to the mouthparts. Like insects, centipedes breathe through a tracheal system, typically with a single opening, or <b>spiracle</b> on each body segment.

These larvae lack the distinctive pigmented tracheal tubes that mark C. hominivorax.|$|E
25|$|Papillomaviruses {{have been}} found in the stomachs of belugas in the Saint Lawrence River. Animals in this {{location}} have also been recorded as suffering infections caused by herpesviruses and in certain cases to be suffering from encephalitis caused by the protozoan Sarcocystis. Cases have been recorded of ciliate protozoa colonising the <b>spiracle</b> of certain individuals, but they not thought to be pathogens or at least they are not very harmful.|$|E
25|$|Adults {{commonly}} feed on {{the blood}} of mammals. They are able to reopen wounds that are almost completely healed. Mouthpart morphology in the genus ranges from sponging mouthparts to mouths with rasping teeth. Many species have enlarged prestomal teeth. The metathoracic <b>spiracle</b> is covered in long, thick setae. The average male Hydrotaea is 6.5-8.5mm and the average female is 5.75-7.5mm. They are very light brown to bluish black with large, red eyes and plumose antennae.|$|E
50|$|Phalangioidea have {{additional}} <b>spiracles</b> on the tibiae of the pedipalps and legs, thus helping in gas exchange {{in the long}} legs.
