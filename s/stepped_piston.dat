5000|$|... 1973 {{also saw}} the start of {{development}} on a new machine with a monocoque pressed steel frame, that also included a 500 cc twin, <b>stepped</b> <b>piston</b> engine called the 'Wulf'. However, as the Norton Villiers Triumph company was again in serious financial problems, development of the 'Wulf' was dropped in favour of the rotary Wankel type engine inherited from BSA.|$|E
50|$|Some small intensifiers {{have been}} {{constructed}} with a <b>stepped</b> <b>piston.</b> This is a double-ended piston, of two different diameters, each end working in a different cylinder. This construction is simple and compact, requiring an overall length little {{more than twice the}} stroke. It is also still necessary to provide two seals, one for each piston, and to vent the area between them. A leak of pressure into the volume between the pistons would transform the machine into an effective single piston with equal area on each side, thus defeating the intensifier effect.|$|E
40|$|The valve, {{especially}} as an overload safety valve for a mechanical press, has a mechanical {{lock on the}} valve piston (1) in the pressure medium flow path between an entry (7) and outlet (9) opening. The lock is a screw which is broken by a pyrotechnic or explosive action. The valve piston (1) has {{the structure of a}} <b>step</b> <b>piston,</b> where it is under loading from the pressure medium. USE - The safety valve is for protection of a mechanical press from damage through overloading. ADVANTAGE - The structure gives a more rapid opening action and the valve piston movement is dampened at the end phase of the opening operation. The system also prevents premature closure of the valve...|$|R

This paper considers a high-durability two-stroke cycle engine in terms of performance and computational modelling of the emissions characteristics for automotive range-extender or hybrid electric vehicle power plant application. The engine uses novel segregated pump charging via the application of <b>stepped</b> <b>pistons,</b> and {{a comparison of the}} engine characteristics is made with those of a comparable four-stroke cycle engine of similar expected power output (more than 60 kW/l). In the interests of cost minimisation, both engines are limited to parallel two-cylinder in-line configurations with the intention of still being able to achieve acceptably low noise, vibration and harshness characteristics. In order to achieve low engine exhaust emissions, computational modelling of direct injection is considered for the stepped-piston engine. A significant reduction in the nitrogen oxide emissions of between 31 % and 55 % is observed...|$|R

It is advisable to reduce friction losses in the piston-cylinder group lead to an increase in the overall efficiency of the engine and thus reduce the fuel consumption. The method to reduce the area covered by the oil film is a modification of the bearing surface of the piston by adjusting the profile.

Hydrostatic effects are analyzed and a complete solution is obtained and an optimum step design for centering of the piston is suggested. The axial speed resulting from an axial driving force is calculated, and some experimental results for pistons falling in a water-filled tube are presented...|$|E

40|$|Design analysis, fabrication, and {{experimental}} evaluation {{were performed on}} three self-acting facetype LOX seal designs and one circumferential-type helium deal design. The LOX seals featured Rayleigh step lift pad and spiral groove geometry for lift augmentation. Machined metal bellows and piston ring secondary seal designs were tested. The helium purge seal featured floating rings with Rayleigh step lift pads. The Rayleigh <b>step</b> pad <b>piston</b> ring and the spiral groove LOX seals were successfully tested for approximately 10 hours in liquid oxygen. The helium seal was successfully tested for 24 hours. The shrouded Rayleigh step hydrodynamic lift pad LOX seal is feasible for advanced, small, high-speed oxygen turbopumps...|$|R
40|$|To {{achieve its}} full {{diffraction}} limit in the infrared, {{the primary mirror}} of the Keck telescope (now telescopes) must be properly phased: The <b>steps</b> or <b>piston</b> errors between the individual mirror segments must be reduced to less than 100 nm. We accomplish this with a wave optics variation of the Shack–Hartmann test, in which the signal is not the centroid but rather the degree of coherence of the individual subimages. Using filters {{with a variety of}} coherence lengths, we can capture segments with initial piston errors as large as ± 30 µm and reduce these to 30 nm—a dynamic range of 3 orders of magnitude. Segment aberrations contribute substantially to the residual errors of ~ 75 nm...|$|R
40|$|Briquetting {{technology}} {{is one of}} compaction, in which a material is pressure to form a product that has a higher bulk density, lower water content, and the diversity in size, and material properties. There {{are two ways to}} improve compaction with or without a binder. Binder is required to make a material that will dibriketkan be homogeneous during the suppression. This thesis aims to design a press machine that can produce briquettes with a diameter of 40 mm and height 10 mm.

50|$|The {{system is}} defined {{to be the}} mass of air that is drawn from the {{atmosphere}} into the cylinder, compressed by the piston, heated by the spark ignition of the added fuel, allowed to expand as it pushes on the piston, and finally exhausted back into the atmosphere. The mass of air is followed as its volume, pressure and temperature change during the various thermodynamic <b>steps.</b> As the <b>piston</b> is capable of moving along the cylinder, {{the volume of the}} air changes with its position in the cylinder. The compression and expansion processes induced on the gas by the movement of the piston are idealised as reversible, i.e., no useful work is lost through turbulence or friction and no heat is transferred to or from the gas during those two processes. Energy is added to the air by the combustion of fuel. Useful work is extracted by the expansion of the gas in the cylinder. After the expansion is completed in the cylinder, the remaining heat is extracted and finally the gas is exhausted to the environment. Useful mechanical work is produced during the expansion process and some of that used to compress the air mass of the next cycle. The useful mechanical work produced minus that used for the compression process is the net work gained and {{that can be used for}} propulsion or for driving other machines. Alternatively the useful work gained is the difference between the heat added and the heat removed.|$|R
