It was officially dedicated on June 1, in a ceremony attended by Dr. Norman Hilberry of the Argonne National Laboratory, who worked on Chicago Pile-1, the world's first nuclear reactor to achieve criticality. During the 1962 World's Fair, hosted by the city at the Seattle Center, the reactor {{became the subject of}} group tours from professional organizations.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 1942, {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project, {{another team}} led by Enrico Fermi was able to {{initiate}} the first artificial <b>self-sustained</b> nuclear chain reaction, Chicago Pile-1. An initial plan using enriched uranium-235 was abandoned as it was as yet unavailable in sufficient quantities. Working in a lab below the stands of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400short tons (360metric tons) of graphite, 58short tons (53metric tons) of uranium oxide, and six short tons (5.5 metric tons) of uranium metal, a majority of which was supplied by Westinghouse Lamp Plant in a makeshift production process.|$|E

25|$|Peruvian {{economic}} performance has been tied to exports, which provide hard currency to finance imports and external debt payments. Peru's main exports are copper, gold, zinc, textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, manufactures, machinery, services and fish meal; its major trade partners are the United States, China, Brazil, European Union and Chile. Although exports have provided substantial revenue, <b>self-sustained</b> growth {{and a more}} egalitarian distribution of income have proven elusive.|$|E
25|$|From {{a physics}} perspective, living beings are {{thermodynamic}} systems with an organized molecular structure that can reproduce itself and evolve as survival dictates. Thermodynamically, {{life has been}} described as an open system which makes use of gradients in its surroundings to create imperfect copies of itself. Hence, life is a <b>self-sustained</b> chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution. A major strength of this definition is that it distinguishes life by the evolutionary process rather than its chemical composition.|$|E

25|$|It was an {{all-metal}} aircraft with a {{tricycle undercarriage}} and conventional low, straight wings with mid-mounted turbojet engines and a high-mounted tailplane {{clear of the}} jet exhaust. The Meteor F.1 exhibited some problematic flying characteristics typical of early jet aircraft; it suffered from stability problems at high transonic speeds, large trim changes, high stick forces and <b>self-sustained</b> yaw instability (snaking) caused by airflow separation over the thick tail surfaces. The longer fuselage of the Meteor T.7, a two-seater trainer, significantly reduced the aerodynamic instability that the early Meteors were known for.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the main}} line of {{research}} via tokamaks has been developed {{to the point that}} it is now possible to undertake the penultimate step in magnetic confinement plasma physics research with a <b>self-sustained</b> reaction. In the tokamak research program, recent advances devoted to controlling the configuration of the plasma have led to the achievement of substantially improved energy and pressure confinement, which reduces the projected cost of electricity from such reactors by a factor of two to a value only about 50% more than the projected cost of electricity from advanced light-water reactors. In addition, progress in the development of advanced, low activation structural materials supports the promise of environmentally benign fusion reactors and research into alternate confinement concepts is yielding the promise of future improvements in confinement. Finally, supporters contend that other potential replacements to the fossil fuels have environmental issues of their own. Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power all have a relatively low power output per square kilometer compared to ITER's successor DEMO which, at 2,000 MW, would have an energy density that exceeds even large fission power stations.|$|E
25|$|NREM {{sleep is}} {{characterized}} by slow oscillations, spindles and delta waves. The slow oscillations {{have been shown to}} be from the cortex, as lesions in other parts of the brain do not affect them, but lesions in the cortex do. The delta waves {{have been shown to be}} generated by reciprocally connected thalamic and cortical neural circuits. During sleep, the thalamus stops relaying sensory information to the brain, however it continues to produce signals that are sent to its cortical projections. These waves are generated in the thalamus even in the absence of the cortex, but the cortical output seems to play a role in the simultaneous firing by large groups of neurons. The thalamic reticular nucleus is considered to be the pacemaker of the sleep spindles. This has been further substantiated by the fact that rhythmic stimulation of the thalamus leads to increased secondary depolarization in cortical neurons, which further results in the increased amplitude of firing, causing <b>self-sustained</b> activity. The sleep spindles have been predicted to play a role in disconnecting the cortex from sensory input and allowing entry of calcium ions into cells, thus potentially playing a role in Plasticity.|$|E

25|$|Factors {{supporting}} {{an important}} role for RNA in early life include its ability to act both to store information and to catalyze chemical reactions (as a ribozyme); its many important roles as an intermediate in the expression of and maintenance of the genetic information (in the form of DNA) in modern organisms; and the ease of chemical synthesis of at least {{the components of the}} RNA molecule under the conditions that approximated the early Earth. Relatively short RNA molecules have been synthesized, capable of replication. Such replicase RNA, which functions as both code and catalyst provides its own template upon which copying can occur. Jack W. Szostak has shown that certain catalytic RNAs can join smaller RNA sequences together, creating the potential for self-replication. If these conditions were present, Darwinian natural selection would favour the proliferation of such autocatalytic sets, to which further functionalities could be added. Such autocatalytic systems of RNA capable of <b>self-sustained</b> replication have been identified. The RNA replication systems, which include two ribozymes that catalyze each other's synthesis, showed a doubling time of the product of about one hour, and were subject to natural selection under the conditions that existed in the experiment. In evolutionary competition experiments, this led to the emergence of new systems which replicated more efficiently. This was the first demonstration of evolutionary adaptation occurring in a molecular genetic system.|$|E

40|$|Trout {{are often}} stocked into alpine lakes {{based on the}} {{assumption}} that resident trout populations are not <b>self-sustaining</b> and would go extinct without regular stocking. However, this assumption has not been rigorously tested. The objectives of our study were to (1) estimate the proportion of currently-stocked alpine lakes in California’s Sierra Nevada (USA) that contain <b>self-sustaining</b> trout populations, (2) identify the characteristics of lakes associated with self-sustainability, and (3) quantify the effects of stocking termination on trout density and individual growth rates in <b>self-sustaining</b> populations. We surveyed trout populations in 95 John Muir Wilderness (JMW) lakes before and after a 4 - 8 year stocking halt and 111 Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Park (SEKI) lakes after a ≥ 20 year stocking hiatus. Seventy-two percent of JMW study lakes and 66 % of SEKI study lakes contained <b>self-sustaining</b> trout populations based on evidence of successful recruitment during the no-stocking period. Regression analysis identified spawning habitat area and lake elevation as significant factors influencing trout population persistence. Trout populations in lakes with > 2. 1 m 2 of spawning habitat and located at elevations < 3520 m were nearly always <b>self-sustaining.</b> For <b>self-sustaining</b> populations, the termination of stocking did not result in significant changes in population density or individual growth rates. We conclude that most trout stocking in Sierra Nevada alpine lakes could be permanently halted without negatively impacting these fisheries...|$|R
