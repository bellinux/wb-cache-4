Glutathione peroxidase, a <b>selenoenzyme,</b> catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides by glutathione. Nitric oxide, a short-lived messenger, is formed from arginine. Porphyrins are synthesized from glycine and succinyl CoA, which condense to give δ-aminolevulinate. Two molecules of this intermediate become linked to form porphobilinogen. Four molecules of porphobilinogen combine to form a linear tetrapyrrole, which cyclizes to uroporphyrinogen III. Oxidation and side-chain modifications lead to the synthesis of protoporphyrin IX, which acquires an iron atom to form heme.|$|E

2500|$|One {{mechanism}} of mercury toxicity involves its irreversible inhibition of <b>selenoenzymes,</b> such as thioredoxin reductase (IC50 = 9 nM). [...] Although it has many functions, thioredoxin reductase restores vitamins C and E, {{as well as}} a number of other important antioxidant molecules, back into their reduced forms, enabling them to counteract oxidative damage. [...] Since the rate of oxygen consumption is particularly high in brain tissues, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is accentuated in these vital cells, making them particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage and especially dependent upon the antioxidant protection provided by <b>selenoenzymes.</b> [...] High mercury exposures deplete the amount of cellular selenium available for the biosynthesis of thioredoxin reductase and other <b>selenoenzymes</b> that prevent and reverse oxidative damage, which, if the depletion is severe and long lasting, results in brain cell dysfunctions that can ultimately cause death.|$|R
40|$|Selenium, an {{essential}} trace element for mammals, is {{incorporated into a}} selected class of selenoproteins as selenocysteine. All known isoenzymes of mammalian thioredoxin (Trx) reductases (TrxRs) employ selenium in the C-terminal redox center -Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly-COOH for reduction of Trx and other substrates, whereas the corresponding sequence in Drosophila melanogaster TrxR is -Ser-Cys-Cys-Ser-COOH. Surprisingly, the catalytic competence of these orthologous enzymes is similar, whereas direct Sec-to-Cys substitution of mammalian TrxR, or other <b>selenoenzymes,</b> yields almost inactive enzyme. TrxRs are therefore ideal for studying the biology of selenocysteine by comparative enzymology. Here we show that the serine residues flanking the C-terminal Cys residues of Drosophila TrxRs are responsible for activating the cysteines to match the catalytic efficiency of a selenocysteine-cysteine pair as in mammalian TrxR, obviating the need for selenium. This finding suggests that the occurrence of <b>selenoenzymes,</b> which implies that the organism is selenium-dependent, is not necessarily associated with improved enzyme efficiency.

50|$|Selenenic acids {{derived from}} selenocysteine are {{involved}} in cell signaling and certain enzymatic processes. The best known <b>selenoenzyme,</b> glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalyzes the reduction of peroxides by glutathione (GSH). The selenenic acid intermediate (E-SeOH) is formed upon oxidation of the catalytically active selenol (E-SeH) by hydrogen peroxide. This selenenic acid derivative of the peroxidase then reacts with a thiol-containing cofactor (GSH) to generate the key intermediate selenenyl sulfide (E-SeSG). This intermediate is subsequently attacked by a second GSH to regenerate the selenol and the glutathione cofactor is released in its oxidized form, GSSG. The catalytic mechanism of GPx, involves selenol (R-SeH), selenenyl sulfide (R1-SeS-R2), and selenenic acid intermediates.|$|E

However, several previous studies {{are small and}} few investigated the association between selenium and colorectal cancer among women whose selenium metabolism may differ from men.

Methods: This nested case–control study investigated whether serum selenium concentration and genetic variants in five <b>selenoenzymes</b> (glutathione peroxidase 1 – 4 and selenoprotein P) were associated with colorectal cancer risk in 804 colorectal cancer cases and 805 matched controls from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study. A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the WHI result with previous studies including 12 observational studies and two clinical trials on selenium. Results:Within the WHI, selenium concentrations were relatively high (mean 135. 6 mg/L) and were not associated with colorectal cancer risk (Ptrend 0. 10); the adjusted OR comparing the fifth with first quintile was 1. 26 (95 % CI, 0. 91 – 1. 73). Moreover, genetic variants in <b>selenoenzymes</b> were not significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk. Consistent with the finding in WHI, our meta-analysis showed no association between selenium and colorectal tumor risk in women (OR 0. 97; 95 % CI, 0. 79 – 1. 18) comparing the highest quantile with the lowest); however, in men, there was a significant inverse association (OR 0. 68; 95 % CI, 0. 57 – 0. 82) (P 0. 01).

The critical role of oxidative {{stress in the}} pathogenesis of MeHg cytotoxicity has been clarified, but the molecular mechanisms underlying MeHg-mediated oxidative stress remain to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate a post-transcriptional effect of MeHg on antioxidant selenoenzymes by using a MeHg-susceptible cell line. MeHg-induced selenium deficiency leads to failure of the recoding of a UGA codon for selenocysteine and results in degradation of the major antioxidant <b>selenoenzyme</b> glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx 1) mRNA by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a cellular mechanism that detects the premature termination codon (PTC) located 5 ′-upstream of the last exon-exon junction and degrades PTC-containing mRNAs. In contrast, thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR 1), another antioxidant <b>selenoenzyme</b> of the thioredoxin system, was likely skipped by NMD because of a UGA codon in the last exon. However, TrxR 1 activity was decreased despite mRNA up-regulation, which was {{probably due to the}} synthesis of aberrant TrxR 1 protein without selenocysteine. Changes in <b>selenoenzyme</b> GPx 1 and TrxR 1 mRNAs were observed earlier than was the incidence of oxidative stress and up-regulation of other antioxidant enzyme mRNAs.

However, selenium did not increase the ability of H 4 IIE cells to take up and reduce 2 mM DHA, despite a 25 % increase in ascorbate-dependent ferricyanide reduction (which reflects cellular ascorbate recycling). Nonetheless, selenium supplements both spared ascorbate in overnight cultures of H 4 IIE cells, and prevented loss of cellular α-tocopherol in response to an oxidant stress induced by either ferricyanide or diazobenzene sulfonate.

In addition, the genome of O. lucimarinus provides insights into the unique metal metabolism of these organisms, which are predicted to have a large number of selenocysteine-containing proteins. <b>Selenoenzymes</b> are more catalytically active than similar enzymes lacking selenium, and thus the cell may require less of that protein.

40|$|The {{importance}} of selenium {{as an essential}} trace element is now well recognized. In proteins, the redox-active selenium moiety is incorporated as selenocysteine (Sec), the 21 st amino acid. In mammals, selenium exerts its redox activities through several selenocysteine-containing enzymes, which include glutathione peroxidase (GPx), iodothyronine deiodinase (ID), and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Although these enzymes have Sec in their active sites, they catalyze completely different reactions and their substrate specificity and cofactor or co-substrate systems are significantly different. The antioxidant enzyme GPx uses the tripeptide glutathione (GSH) for the catalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides, whereas the larger and more advanced mammalian TrxRs have cysteine moieties in different subunits and prefer to utilize these internal cysteines as thiol cofactors for their catalytic activity. On the other hand, the nature of in vivo cofactor for the deiodinating enzyme ID is not known, although the use of thiols as reducing agents has been well-documented.

The role of selenocysteine moiety in natural mammalian enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), iodothyronine deiodinase (ID) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is highlighted and the effect of other amino acid residues located in close proximity to selenocysteine is described. It is evident from various studies that two amino acid residues, tryptophan and glutamine, appear in identical positions in all known members of the GPx family. Ac-cording to the three-dimensional structure established for bovine GPx, these residues could constitute a catalytic triad in which the selenol group of the selenocysteine is both stabilized and activated by hydro-gen bonding with the imino group of the tryptophan (Trp) residue and with the amido group of the gluta-mine (Gln) residue.
