25|$|The new Fronte {{was a big}} <b>step</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> SS20, {{making the}} switch from a rear-engined, rear-wheel drive {{configuration}} to a more up-to-date transversely mounted engine in front, driving the front wheels. Wheelbase was increased from 2030 to 2150mm and the new car was much more spacious. The four-door Fronte had an opening rear glass window, whereas the two-door Alto got a proper rear hatch. In some export markets the car was just known as the Suzuki SS40. In Europe, the Fronte (labelled Alto) was also sold with a 796cc four-stroke three (SS80) from July 1981 and was 100mm longer, thanks to bigger bumpers. These cars also received larger 12-inch wheels. Four-doors received the SS80F chassis code, while three-door passenger versions were called SS80G.|$|E

The Phoenixs cockpit labels came from McDonnell-Douglas space shuttle manuals. Eaves considered the Vulcan ship a [...] "fun" [...] vessel to design. Only two major Vulcan ships had been previously seen in Star Trek, including a courier vessel from [...] Since the two-engine ship format had been seen many times, the artists decided to <b>step</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traditional ship layout, creating a more artistic than functional design. The ship incorporated elements of a starfish and a crab. Because of budget constraints, the full ship was realized as a computer-generated design. Only a boomerang-shaped landing foot was fabricated for the actors to interact with.|$|E

[...] Two more compilations of Lat's editorial cartoons (With a Little Bit of Lat and Lots More Lat) were published {{and the number of}} people who recognised him continued to grow. [...] In 1984, partly from a desire to <b>step</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> limelight, Lat resigned from the New Straits Times to become a freelancer, but continued to draw Scenes of Malaysia Life for the newspaper. [...] He set up his own company, Kampung Boy Sendirian Berhad (Village Boy private limited), to oversee the merchandising of his cartoon characters and publishing of his books. [...] In 2009, Kampung Boy partnered Sanrio and Hit Entertainment in a project to open an indoor theme park which would later be called as Puteri Harbour Family Theme Park in Nusajaya, Johor in August 2012.

500|$|During {{the game}} of the seventh round between Nigel Short and Li Chao, the former was {{returning}} from the toilet with about 30 minutes to make 20 moves when an anti-cheating arbiter asked him to undergo a spot check with a hand scanner for electronic devices. Short did not heed the request, and sat back down to play. After the game, Klaus Deventer (the head of the anti-cheating arbiters) reprimanded Short with a warning. Short discussed the incident extensively after the event, indicating {{that he did not}} think the cost of annoyance to the player (even when returning from outside the playing area) was comparable to the anti-cheating benefit, though he was not pressed specifically regarding cases where a culprit had in fact been disqualified following mid-game requests for inspection (some for refusal, others for being caught with a device). Initially Short also mentioned the fact that he and the arbiter in question (Jamie Kenmure, an Australian who is FIDE delegate for the Solomon Islands) have a political past, and thus Short did not trust that his being selected for the test actually originated from Deventer (as per the regulations). Alternative initial reports dramatised the event to have the arbiters [...] "ask him to <b>step</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> board and subject himself to a full search" [...] while in time trouble and playing a [...] "do-or-die" [...] position, though these details now seem discredited.|$|E
500|$|While Carly Darlin of The Orange County Register {{found the}} record to be [...] "an {{energetic}} and fun restatement of the RHCP whiplash funk attitude", {{she believed that}} [...] "with {{the exception of the}} dreamy instrumental 'Pretty Little Ditty', it doesn't break any new ground." [...] She continued by saying that, if anything [...] "Mother's Milk is a slight <b>step</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> party-funk grooves of the last two albums and a return to the band's punk-rock roots. They even reprise the cover of Jimi Hendrix's 'Fire', which they did as a B-side for their 'Fight Like A Brave' 12-inch two years ago." [...] Furthermore, Mark Jenkins of The Washington Post said [...] "the polite term for albums like 'Milk' is 'eclectic', but it really sounds as if the band is unraveling [...] Considering the circumstances, it's not especially surprising that the album seems to be looking for someone to give it directions." [...] However, Jenkins did believe Frusciante possessed [...] "solid metal chops and means to show them off." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau mocked the band's ability to promote empathy and found the guitar layering in Mother's Milk to have been done improperly: [...] "punks who loved Hendrix and P-Funk way way back, they're finally cashing in on their good taste, and though unbelievers dis their sincerity, execution's the problem. They didn't have the chops to bring it off then, and by pushing the guitar up front they sound even cruder now. But they're perfectly nice fellas, really—mention 'compassion' in the very first verse." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{say that}} the move to drum and bass was a {{conscious}} and concerted reaction by top DJs and producers against a culture that was becoming tinged with gangster types and violent elements, and stereotyped with the recognizable production techniques of ragga-influenced producers. The release of General Levy's [...] "Incredible" [...] record in 1994 is taken by many as being the key-point in the transformation. This ragga influenced track contains a statement by General Levy claiming to be the [...] "original junglist" [...] {{at a time in}} which he was proclaiming publicly that [...] "I run jungle" [...] which in turn angered the most powerful and influential drum and bass producers, resulting in a blacklisting of General Levy and possibly a conscious <b>step</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ragga sound.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the [...] formal {{innovations}} of Modernism {{as exemplified}} {{in the work}} of T. S.

During the 1960s, with a surge of interest in Confessional poetry, publication of formal poetry became increasingly unfashionable. [...] The emergence of the Language poets in the 1970s was one reaction to the predominance of the informal confessional lyric. [...] But language poetry was another <b>step</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traditions of metre and rhyme, and was seen by some [...] as widening the divide between poetry and its public.|$|E
2500|$|The {{explosion}} of popular drama that began when James Burbage {{built the first}} fixed and permanent venue for drama, The Theatre, in 1576 was the one great <b>step</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> medieval organizational model and toward the commercial theatre; but that evolution was, at best, a [...] "work in progress" [...] throughout the English Renaissance. Throughout this period, troupes of actors needed to maintain the patronage of a noble household. The prevailing legal system in England defined [...] "masterless men" [...] who traveled about the country as vagabonds, and subjected them to treatments of varying harshness. Local authorities {{tended to be more}} hostile than welcoming toward players; the Corporation of London, from the Lord Mayor and aldermen down, was famously hostile to acting troupes, as were the Puritans. Noble patronage was, at the very least, the legal fig leaf that allowed professional players to function in society.|$|E
