40|$|A small {{library of}} anticancer, cell-permeating, stapled {{peptides}} based on potent dual-specific antagonist of p 53 –MDM 2 /MDMX interactions, PMI-N 8 A, was synthesized, characterized and screened for anticancer activity against human colorectal cancer cell line, HCT- 116. Employed synthetic modifications included: S-alkylation-based <b>stapling,</b> <b>point</b> mutations increasing hydrophobicity in key residues {{as well as}} improvement of cell-permeability by introduction of polycationic sequence(s) that were woven into the sequence of parental peptide. Selected analogue, ArB 14 Co, was also tested in vivo and exhibited potent anticancer bioactivity at the low dose (3. 0 mg/kg). Collectively, {{our findings suggest that}} application of stapling in combination with rational design of polycationic short analogues may be a suitable approach in the development of physiologically active p 53 –MDM 2 /MDMX peptide inhibitors...|$|E

40|$|Self-tracking {{most notably}} emerged {{over the last}} century (Crawford et al. 2015). To self-track is to record life activities, {{encoding}} them into a series of quantified variables–or what has been called “health” and “lifestyle” data (Whooley et al. 2014, 153). Commonly, this is practiced with wearable de- vices, such as wristbands (FitBit), necklaces (Misfit), pendants, and badges (Narrative Clip), which are tethered to smartphones and personal computers. Through these devices, a meal is measured by its calorific quantity, a heartbeat measured by its rate, and sitting at a desk is rendered the calculable accumulation of inactivity. Yet, this perspective on health and lifestyle is not particularly new. Defining food as energy, knowing the importance of a regular heart rate and the value of exercise are <b>staple</b> <b>points</b> of advice in general medical practice. However, these are no longer exclusively “medical␣ perceptions...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThis study {{compared}} {{the resistance of}} glued versus stapled anastomosis of the colon to intraluminal pressures at different times during healing. MethodsForty seven female domestic pigs, mean weight of 30. 7 kg, were used. Maximum physiological luminal pressures, i. e. the pressure resisted by a catheter inserted into the intestinal lumen via a puncture without it being released and without injury to the surrounding intestinal wall, was performed in 5 control animals. The remaining 42 animals were divided into 3 groups of 14 animals each based on time from anastomosis construction. Each group was divided into 2 subgroups with stapled or glued anastomoses. Intraluminal pressure was measured on the first, third, and fifth day post-surgery. ResultsThe maximum pressures resisted by anastomoses {{were significantly higher than}} the physiological pressures in all groups. At all time <b>points,</b> <b>stapled</b> anastomoses resisted higher intraluminal pressures than glued ones. However, glued anastomoses resisted pressures significantly higher than physiological pressure. As healing advanced, glued anastomoses neared the resistance to intraluminal pressures of stapled anastomoses. ConclusionHealing with absorbable synthetic glue was as good as with staples. Glued anastomoses resisted pressures that were statistically significantly higher than physiological intraluminal colon pressures but lower than stapled ones...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Although several {{articles}} {{can be found}} on wrist trauma, a detailed literature search reveals limited articles that are focused specifically on penetrating puncture wounds of the wrist and the clinical approach to puncture-type penetrating wrist injuries. The number of penetrating injuries of the wrist has increased dramatically, especially since the widespread usage of the nail gun and staplegun technologies. The {{purpose of this article is}} not to analyze the approach to extensive wrist injuries and lacerations but how to evaluate and treat smaller puncture wounds that may potentially lead to significant clinical sequelae. Methods: This study describes a case of a staplegun injury to the radial artery of a 44 -year-old man. The injury was treated with segmental arterial resection and anastomosis. Results: Postoperatively the patient had an uncomplicated course with good radial arterial flow and complete functional recovery of the hand. Conclusion: It is crucial to be conservative and have a high index of suspicion after puncture penetrating wrist injuries. The clinical presentation varies significantly according to the anatomical structure and there may be no obvious clinical signs of injury, as in the described case. In addition, even a minor deep foreign body in the wrist should alert one for immediate operative approach, possibly with the need for microsurgical preparedness for vessel or nerve repair. Only very superficial dermal or subcutaneous puncture wounds can be safely cleaned and managed in the emergency department. CASE REPORT A 44 -year-old man, otherwise healthy, presented to the University Hospital emergency room, complaining of left wrist pain after an industrial type stapler was accidentally misfired in the volar-radial wrist area. Upon examination, there was a 2. 5 -cm rigid, nonmobile staple with one of the 2 <b>staple</b> insertion <b>points</b> corresponding to the anatomical position of the radial artery (Fig 1). However, the patient had an excellent radial pulse proximal and distal to the punctured spot. Allen’s test was questionable. The other insertion point radiologicall...|$|R
