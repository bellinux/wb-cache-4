50|$|The 1997 Labour Party {{manifesto}} made {{a specific}} commitment {{to end the}} Conservatives’ internal market in health care, but in government they retained the split between purchasers and providers of healthcare. In 2000 the Labour Government agreed A Concordat with the Private and Voluntary Health Care Provider Sector with the Independent Healthcare Association. The intention was to increase capacity, particularly in elective care, where private provision was used to bring down waiting lists, in critical care, and in intermediate care facilities. This was followed, in April 2002,by the introduction of prospective payment with nationally set prices for acute, elective activity under ‘payment by results’. Under patient choice patients could opt for treatment by a private provider paid by the NHS. The NHS Plan {{led to the development}} of independent sector treatment centres which provide fast, pre-booked surgery and diagnostic tests for NHS funded patients separating <b>scheduled</b> <b>treatment</b> from emergency care. These centres played a role in reducing the price paid for ‘spot purchases’ with private providers. Previously when the NHS had made use of the independent sector on an ad hoc basis, it often paid 40-100% more than the equivalent cost to the NHS. The NHS Improvement Plan: Putting people at the heart of publicservices, published in 2004 there was an expectation that the independent sector would supply up to 15% of NHS services by 2008, but this figure was not reached.|$|E

Five participants, chronological ages 4; 6 to 5; 11 years, received MLG treatment for diagnosed CAS in two different <b>treatment</b> <b>schedules,</b> mass and distributed. The mass schedule consisted of four weekly 60 -minute treatment sessions for a total of 240 minutes of intervention. The distributed schedule consisted of 16 15 -minute treatment sessions provided four days a week for a total of 240 minutes of intervention. With the mass <b>treatment</b> <b>schedule,</b> participants demonstrated an increase in performance accuracy by an average of 9. 1 %.

We developed an in silico method to predict the effect of <b>treatment</b> <b>schedule</b> on efficacy that couples PK/PD with tissue-level transport. <b>Treatment</b> <b>schedules</b> were implemented on theoretical drugs with different PK/PD and transport properties.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Stopping {{antiretroviral}} {{therapy in}} patients with HIV- 1 infection can reduce costs and side-effects, but carries the risk of increased immune suppression and emergence of resistance. METHODS: 430 patients with CD 4 -positive T-lymphocyte (CD 4) counts greater than 350 cells per muL, and viral load less than 50 copies per mL were randomised to continued therapy (n= 146) or <b>scheduled</b> <b>treatment</b> interruptions (n= 284). Median time on randomised treatment was 21. 9 months (range 16. 4 - 25. 3). Primary endpoints were proportion of patients with viral load less than 50 copies per mL {{at the end of}} the trial, and amount of drugs used. Analysis was intention-to-treat. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials. gov with the identifier NCT 00113126. FINDINGS: Drug savings in the <b>scheduled</b> <b>treatment</b> interruption group, compared with continuous treatment, amounted to 61. 5 %. 257 of 284 (90. 5 %) patients in the <b>scheduled</b> <b>treatment</b> interruption group reached a viral load less than 50 copies per mL, compared with 134 of 146 (91. 8 %) in the continued treatment group (difference 1. 3 %, 95 % CI- 4. 3 to 6. 9, p= 0. 90). No AIDS-defining events occurred. Diarrhoea and neuropathy were more frequent with continuous treatment; candidiasis was more frequent with <b>scheduled</b> <b>treatment</b> interruption. Ten patients (2. 3 %) had resistance mutations, with no significant differences between groups. INTERPRETATION: Drug savings with <b>scheduled</b> <b>treatment</b> interruption were substantial, and no evidence of increased treatment resistance emerged.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: <b>Scheduled</b> <b>treatment</b> {{interruption}} {{appears to}} be an attractive alternative to continuous treatment in reducing side effects and costs and increasing comfort and quality of life by reducing overall drug exposure. The question is whether such an interruption is safe. The development of resistance, treatment failure, and the occurrence of diseases induced by decreasing CD 4 cell counts or virological rebound are matters of concern. RECENT FINDINGS: Fixed-cycle <b>scheduled</b> <b>treatment</b> interruption and CD 4 cell-guided treatment interruption have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials. <b>Scheduled</b> <b>treatment</b> interruptions, particularly guided by CD 4 cell counts, dramatically reduce drug exposure by approximately 60 %. The results regarding toxicity and quality of life are more confusing. Against expectations, most trials show little or no reduction in drug-related toxicity and no increase in quality of life. SUMMARY: Antiretroviral treatment interruption strategies reduce costs significantly but have inconclusive effects on toxicity and quality of life. The progression of HIV and development of resistance have been reported; therefore <b>scheduled</b> <b>treatment</b> interruption cannot be recommended over continuous treatment. Interruptions using a lower threshold of at least 350 CD 4 cells/microl, lasting less than 3 months, and considering the pharmacological properties of drugs may be safe for most patients...|$|E

Design, setting and participants Eleven neurophysiotherapists participated in the established methodology: semi-structured interviews, focus groups and piloting a draft <b>treatment</b> <b>schedule</b> in clinical practice. Different physiotherapists (n = 13) used the <b>treatment</b> <b>schedule</b> to record <b>treatment</b> given to stroke patients with mild, moderate and severe upper limb paresis. Rating of adequacy of the <b>treatment</b> <b>schedule</b> was made using a visual analogue scale (0 to 100 mm). Mean (95 % confidence interval) visual analogue scores were calculated (expert criterion validity). For intra-rater reliability, each physiotherapist observed a video tape of their treatment and immediately completed a <b>treatment</b> <b>schedule</b> recording form on two separate occasions, 4 to 6 weeks apart. The Kappa statistic was calculated for intra-rater reliability. Results The <b>treatment</b> <b>schedule</b> consists of a one-page A 4 recording form and a user booklet, detailing 50 treatment activities.

The study consisted of two trials (2006 - 2007 and 2008 - 2009). Water volumes applied, plant height and diameter, leaf gas exchange, leaf petiole nutrient levels, fruit yields and fruit total soluble solids were measured throughout the study. For both trials, significantly more water was applied in the set <b>schedule</b> irrigation <b>treatment</b> than in all other treatments; historic ET and soil water based treatments received only about 31 - 36 % of the water applied in the set schedule irrigation.

We aimed to assess any effects on site-specific cancer rates in the randomised trials of folic acid supplementation, at doses higher than those from fortification. METHODS: In these meta-analyses, we sought all trials completed before 2011 that compared folic acid versus placebo, had <b>scheduled</b> <b>treatment</b> duration at least 1 year, included at least 500 participants, and recorded data on cancer incidence. We obtained individual participant datasets that included 49, 621 participants in all 13 such trials (ten trials of folic acid for prevention of cardiovascular disease [n= 46, 969] and three trials in patients with colorectal adenoma [n= 2652]). All these trials were evenly randomised. The main outcome was incident cancer (ignoring non-melanoma skin cancer) during the <b>scheduled</b> <b>treatment</b> period (among participants who were still free of cancer). We compared those allocated folic acid with those allocated placebo, and used log-rank analyses to calculate the cancer incidence rate ratio (RR). FINDINGS: During a weighted average <b>scheduled</b> <b>treatment</b> duration of 5 · 2 years, allocation to folic acid quadrupled plasma concentrations of folic acid (57 · 3 nmol/L for the folic acid groups vs 13 · 5 nmol/L for the placebo groups), but had no significant effect on overall cancer incidence (1904 cancers in the folic acid groups vs 1809 cancers in the placebo groups, RR 1 · 06, 95 % CI 0 · 99 – 1 · 13, p= 0 · 10). There was no trend towards greater effect with longer treatment. There was no significant heterogeneity between the results of the 13 individual trials (p= 0 · 23), or between the two overall results in the cadiovascular prevention trials and the adenoma trials (p= 0 · 13). Moreover, there was no significant effect of folic acid supplementation on the incidence of cancer of the large intestine, prostate, lung, breast, or any other specific site. INTERPRETATION: Folic acid supplementation does not substantially increase or decrease incidence of site-specific cancer during the first 5 years of treatment.
