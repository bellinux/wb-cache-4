5|$|A {{preoccupation with}} his own {{mortality}} permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based {{on a number of}} poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony used throughout. Shostakovich dedicated this <b>score</b> <b>to</b> his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony.|$|E
