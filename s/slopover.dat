40|$|Abstract Cluster-plot designs, {{including}} the design {{used by the}} Forest Inventory and Analysis program of the USDA Forest Service (FIA), are attended by a complicated boundary <b>slopover</b> problem. <b>Slopover</b> occurs where inclusion zones of objects of interest cross the boundary of the area of interest. The dispersed nature of inclusion zones that arise {{from the use of}} cluster plots precludes the use of most of the slopover-correction methods that apply to solitary plots. One exception is the walkthrough method, which corrects for <b>slopover</b> bias in radially symmetric cluster-plot designs. In this article, we provide a modification of the walkthrough method, the 2 ̆ 2 walkabout method, 2 ̆ 2 which is applicable to some asymmetric cluster-plot designs, such as the one used by FIA. We also present two general correction methods, the 2 ̆ 2 vectorwalk method 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 reflection method, 2 ̆ 2 both of which are applicable to cluster-plot designs with satellite subplots arranged in a regular or irregular pattern. The reflection method has two sets of protocols, one that applies to radially symmetric designs and to asymmetric designs with random orientation; the other set applies to asymmetric designs with fixed orientation. Both the vectorwalk and reflection methods incorporate the walkthrough method on a subplot-by-subplot basis. All four methods correct for <b>slopover</b> bias for straight or curved boundaries, and where work outside the tract is impossible...|$|E
