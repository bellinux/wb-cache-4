Like CR511 in New Jersey, NY210 is the primary lakeside roadway along Greenwood Lake, an interstate lake located roughly equally in New Jersey and New York. NY210 heads north from the state line along {{the western edge of the}} base of a deep valley {{surrounding}} the lake to a community known as Indian Park, entirely situated on the <b>steep</b> <b>incline</b> leading away from the lake. The route continues on to the eponymous village of Greenwood Lake, located at the northern tip of the lake.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century turnpikes {{arrived in}} the area and then in the 19th {{communications}} improved with the building of the Grand Western Canal, which reached the town in 1835, and then the Bristol and Exeter Railway. Wellington station was opened when the line reached the town on 1 May 1843. It was a typical Brunel design but was rebuilt in 1932 when two loop lines were put in. This entailed the platforms being moved back to accommodate the widened lines. These platforms are clearly visible and a goods shed still stands {{on the east side of}} the line at the Taunton end of the station, although the station closed on 5 October 1964. Wellington was an important station as it stood at the foot of a <b>steep</b> <b>incline.</b> Banking locomotives were kept here, ready to assist heavy westbound trains up to Whiteball Tunnel.|$|E

5|$|On 7 March, at the Battle of Craonne, another {{incident}} occurred, seemingly indicating {{that there had}} been some sort of disagreement between the General and the Emperor. As the battle was raging, General Belliard from the Emperor's staff came to Nansouty and told him that he had orders to relieve him of command should his health prevent him from exercising his duties. Nansouty responded that he was indeed ill, but {{that he was able to}} retain command. Although in unusually bad humour after this incident, Nansouty subsequently led a most brilliant action at Craonne. He was ordered to cross bogged and broken terrain, and climb a <b>steep</b> <b>incline</b> with his cavalry and artillery, in order to fall on the enemy's right flank. Managing to bring his cavalrymen on the ridge, Nansouty formed them in line and launched them against the enemy, pushing back in disorder two Russian battalions. Nansouty was again wounded during this action, but this injury was not very serious and he continued to energetically lead his men. Napoleon then allegedly ordered Nansouty to assault a redoubt, under the most murderous fire. Nonetheless, Nansouty ordered his men to halt and advanced alone towards the position. Asked to explain his behaviour, he replied that he would not send his men to die in vain and that he would be attacking alone. Napoleon at once revoked his order.|$|E

The southern, southeastern and eastern portions of the castle are reinforced by bastions and curtain walls.

25|$|The first steam tram {{to service}} Darling Street was in 1892. Ten {{years later the}} service was electrified. A feature of this line was a {{counterweight}} dummy system that controlled and assisted trams on a steep single-line section of track near the terminus at Darling Street wharf. Due to the very <b>steep</b> <b>incline</b> {{at the bottom of}} the street, the trams used a complex 'dummy' / counterweight system constructed under the road surface. A 4-wheel 'dummy' car sat on the single-track at the top of the hill, connected via a large sheave under the track to the counterweight running on a narrow-gauge track in a tunnel under the road. A tram destined for the wharf would close-up to the dummy and push it down the steep hill (gradient 1 in 8), thus raising the counterweight and being assisted in braking. The tram was then assisted up the hill by the weight of the descending counterweight via the dummy. The dummy is behind car 2010 in the photograph below, and is on display at the Sydney Tramway Museum. The slot through which the dummy was fixed to the cable can be seen in that photograph.|$|E

A <b>steep</b> <b>incline</b> dropped from the mineral line east of Abergynolwyn station to the village below, where a series of tram lines radiated.

[...] Zayas deployed these battalions, from the Spanish second line, in two groups. Two battalions of Spanish Guards were formed up, in line, {{at the top of}} a <b>steep</b> <b>incline</b> while the remaining two formed close columns behind them; a single battery of Spanish artillery supported the whole position.|$|E

500|$|On May 22, 2002 around 9:30a.m., {{skeletal}} remains matching Levy's dental records were discovered {{by a man}} walking his dog and looking for turtles in Rock Creek Park, near Broad Branch Creek. Detectives found bones and personal items scattered, but not buried, in a forested area along a <b>steep</b> <b>incline.</b> A sports bra, sweat shirt, leggings and tennis shoes were among the evidence that was recovered. Though police had previously searched over half the 1,754-acre main section of the park (2.74mi2, 7.10km2), the wooded slope where Levy's remains were eventually found had not been searched. Police commanders ordered the search perimeters to 100 yards of each road and trail but a miscommunication had the officers only searching within 100 yards of every road. The remains were found about four miles [...] (6km) from Levy's apartment.|$|E
500|$|In January 1837 Cooke {{proposed}} a {{design for a}} 60-code telegraph to {{the directors of the}} Liverpool and Manchester Railway. [...] This was too complicated for their purposes; the immediate need was for a simple signal communication between the Liverpool station and a rope-haulage engine house {{at the top of a}} <b>steep</b> <b>incline</b> through a long tunnel outside the station. [...] Rope-haulage into main stations was common at this time to avoid noise and pollution, and in this case the gradient was too steep for the locomotive to ascend unaided. [...] All that was required were a few simple signals such as an indication to the engine house to start hauling. [...] Cooke was requested to build a simpler version with fewer codes, which he did by the end of April 1837. [...] However, the railway decided to use instead a pneumatic telegraph equipped with whistles. [...] Soon after this Cooke went into partnership with Wheatstone.|$|E

500|$|The {{additional}} railway routes put the {{two short}} [...] platforms of Brunel's terminus under pressure and a scheme was developed to extend the station. An enabling Act of Parliament was passed in 1865 and between 1871 and 1878 the station was extensively rebuilt. Brunel's platforms were extended by [...] towards London and a new three-platform through station built {{on the site of}} the express platform, while the B station was closed and the site used for a new carriage shed. This work is usually attributed to Brunel's former associate Matthew Digby Wyatt, but there is no documentary evidence of his involvement in the Minutes of the Station Joint Committee.

500|$|On February 18, the seven-man rescue party scaled Frémont Pass (now Donner Pass); as {{they neared}} where Eddy told them the cabins would be, they began to shout.

Sodden oxhide roofs had begun to rot and the smell was overpowering. Thirteen people at the camps were dead, and their bodies had been loosely buried in snow near the cabin roofs. Some of the emigrants seemed emotionally unstable. Three of the rescue party trekked to the Donners and brought back four gaunt children and three adults.
