40|$|The {{effects of}} Sino-US and Sino-EU <b>safeguard</b> <b>agreements</b> on US, China and world cotton and textile sectors are {{investigated}} using a partial equilibrium model. The effects are {{compared to a}} free trade scenario under {{the provisions of the}} Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC). The two agreements capping Chinese textile exports would decrease China's textile and apparel exports, production and domestic consumption by an average 1. 57 percent, 0. 63 percent and, 0. 32 percent respectively. The <b>safeguard</b> <b>agreements</b> cause an increase in the U. S. cotton textile price index and a slight decrease in U. S. net textile imports and textile consumption. The agreements cause a decrease in the world cotton price and the quantity of cotton traded, but these trends reverse at safeguard expiration. The results generally support the view that the <b>safeguard</b> <b>agreements</b> forestall the effects of free trade in textiles and apparel rather than creating long lasting shifts in the textile trade.

40|$|<b>Safeguards</b> <b>Agreements</b> are the {{important}} legal {{institution in the}} system of international control of peaceful utilization of the atomic energy. The control is kept by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The control activities of this organization have to secure that any help offered by itself, by its request, or under its supervision or control cannot be diverted into any military goals. The control activities of the Agency in this scope have to preclude any proliferation of nuclear technology by means of eliminating the situations of inadequate utilization of the Organization's assistance by a State and to prevent a seizure or increase in an army nuclear supplies used and produced in the objects subjected to the safeguards system of the IAEA. The control activities of the Agency is regulated by many acts, the essential ones are: the IAEA Statute, the Safeguards Document, the Inspectors Document. They provide the key model of the control system. These provisions are specified in the <b>Safeguards</b> <b>Agreements.</b> The agreements are concluded between the Agency and one or several member states and they contain commitments of the states- -parties to the agreement to use materials equipment and installations subjected to the IAEA safeguards solely for peaceful goals, the organization is granted the right to control carrying out the commitments of the contracting states. The agreements can concern whether a project of utilization of the Agency assistance or bilateral or multilateral regulation in the scope of utilization of the atomic energy, enabling a contracting state {{to apply to the}} organization asking for executing safeguards, they can also refer to any activity of a state pertinent to the atomic energy which is unilaterally subjected to the safeguards of the Agency. The author of the article indicates at the substance of the <b>Safeguards</b> <b>Agreements</b> and discusses their particular types in the IAEA regulations and practice. These are: Project <b>Agreements,</b> <b>Safeguards</b> Transfer <b>Agreements,</b> <b>Safeguards</b> Execution <b>Agreements,</b> Unilateral <b>Safeguards</b> Submission <b>Agreements,</b> Supplementary and Subsidiary Agreements.

25|$|In UN Security Council Resolution 1737 of 26 December 2006, the Council {{imposed a}} series of {{sanctions}} on Iran for its non-compliance with the earlier Security Council resolution deciding that Iran suspend enrichment-related activities without delay. These sanctions were primarily targeted against the transfer of nuclear and ballistic missile technologies and, in response to concerns of China and Russia, were lighter than that sought by the United States. This resolution followed {{a report from the}} IAEA that Iran had permitted inspections under its <b>safeguards</b> <b>agreement</b> but had not suspended its enrichment-related activities.|$|E
25|$|As a {{response}} to India’s nuclear test conducted 18 May 1974, the United States adopted more restrictive policies regulating the transfer of nuclear fuel and related technologies to different countries, including Brazil. In addition to suspending USAEC contracts of uranium supply, U.S. officials also pressed the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) Supply Agency to cease all transfers of special nuclear material to Brazil. Likewise, the U.S. pushed West Germany to remove ultracentrifugation technology from its agreement with Brazil and tried to craft a complementary <b>safeguards</b> <b>agreement</b> with the IAEA.|$|E

25|$|North Korea's {{nuclear weapons}} program {{dates back to the}} 1980s. Focusing on {{practical}} uses of nuclear energy and the completion of a nuclear weapon development system, North Korea began to operate facilities for uranium fabrication and conversion, and conducted high-explosive detonation tests. In 1985 North Korea ratified the NPT but did not include the required <b>safeguards</b> <b>agreement</b> with the IAEA until 1992. In early 1993, while verifying North Korea's initial declaration, the IAEA concluded that there was strong evidence this declaration was incomplete. When North Korea refused the requested special inspection, the IAEA reported its noncompliance to the UN Security Council. In 1993, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the NPT, but suspended that withdrawal before it took effect.|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{issues of}} international law related {{to the implementation of}} provisions of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The author's study on the control activities of the International Atomic Energy Agency in the field of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons constitute the basic part of the article. In the light of provisions of the Treaty the MAEA is the sole competent organ to perform international control of its observance. Subjective and objective scope of the MAEA control activities in this range is defined in the Treaty provisions and the specific control procedures —- in the provisions of the Agency Statute and in its specific regulations (Safeguards Document, Inspectors Document) {{as well as in the}} provisions of <b>Safeguards</b> <b>Agreements.</b> Essentially, the author focuses on problems of <b>Safeguards</b> <b>Agreements</b> concluded in a result of implementation of the Treaty provisions. <b>Safeguards</b> <b>Agreements</b> concluded by the Agency and a State of a group of member States, contain regulations on general grounds and rules of control activity of the Agency in the scope of peace nuclear activities of member States and provisions defining procedure of applying control mechanisms. The author discusses substantiate of these agreements on the example of a typical agreement of MAEA with Poland, and interprets its basic provisions. A considerable part of the article is the assessment of effectiveness of the control system of International Atomic Energy Agency in the light of implementation of provisions of the Non-Pirolif eration Treaty.

2500|$|After public {{allegations}} about Iran's previously undeclared nuclear activities, the IAEA launched {{an investigation that}} concluded in November 2003 that Iran had systematically failed to meet its obligations under its NPT <b>safeguards</b> <b>agreement</b> to report those activities to the IAEA, although it also reported no evidence of links to a nuclear weapons program. The IAEA Board of Governors delayed a formal finding of non-compliance until September 2005, and reported that non-compliance to the UN Security Council in February 2006. After the IAEA Board of Governors reported Iran's noncompliance with its <b>safeguards</b> <b>agreement</b> to the United Nations Security Council, the Council demanded that Iran suspend its enrichment programs. The Council imposed sanctions after Iran refused to do so.

2500|$|Most experts {{recognize}} that non-compliance with an NPT <b>safeguards</b> <b>agreement</b> is not {{equivalent to a}} violation of the NPT or does not automatically constitute {{a violation of the}} NPT itself. The IAEA does not make determinations regarding compliance with the NPT, and the UN Security Council does not have a responsibility to adjudicate treaty violations. Dr. James Acton, an associate in the Nonproliferation Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has said the 2010 NPT Review Conference could {{recognize that}} non-compliance with safeguards agreements would violate article III of the NPT. Director of the Australian Nonproliferation and Safeguards Organization and then Chairman of IAEA Standing Advisory Group on Safeguards Implementation John Carlson wrote in considering the case of Iran that [...] "formally IAEA Board of Governors (BOG) decisions concern compliance with safeguards agreements, rather than the NPT as such, but in practical terms non-compliance with a <b>safeguards</b> <b>agreement</b> constitutes non-compliance with the NPT." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{goals of}} this case study are: (1) To examine the {{correlation}} between Iran's nuclear program and clerical statements; (2) To evaluate {{the importance of these}} statements; (3) To understand the relationship between policy and fatwas (Islamic decrees); (4) To address the issue of a 'nuclear fatwa'; and (5) To examine how, if at all, Sharia (Islamic law) has influenced Iran's actions or inactions with respect to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and Iran's adherence to its IAEA <b>Safeguards</b> <b>Agreements</b> and the Additional Protocol. The Islamic Republic of Iran (hereinafter Iran) is one of two theocracies in the world, the second being Vatican City. Iran's government derives its constitutional, moral, and political legitimacy from Islam. As a result of this theocratic culture, rules are set and interpreted with a much different calibrator than that of the Western world. Islam affects all aspects of Iranian life. This is further {{complicated by the fact that}} Islam is not a nationalistic faith, in that many people all over the world believe in and adhere to Islamic principles. As a result, a political system that derives much of its fervor from being nationalistic is caught between two worlds, one within the land boundaries of Iran and the other within a faith that transcends boundaries. Thus, any understanding of Islamic law must first be understood within this delicate balance of nationalism and transcendence. Iran has found itself on the international stage concerning its nuclear program. Because Iran is a theocratic state, it is imperative to examine its political moves, speeches, rights, and obligations through the lens of Islam. This study will examine how Islam plays a role in Iran's dealing with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), its understanding of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), including parties obligations under <b>Safeguards</b> <b>Agreements</b> and the Additional Protocol, and also provide a recommendation on how to move forward in dealings with Iran based in part on an understanding of Islamic principles...|$|R
