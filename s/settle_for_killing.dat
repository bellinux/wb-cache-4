500|$|In Haditha, {{after the}} Marines were {{withdrawn}} {{in order to}} fight in Fallujah, insurgents [...] "rounded up dozens of local police officers and publicly executed them in a soccer stadium." [...] When the Marines were withdrawn a second time later in 2004 there were similar massacres of local police. [...] They enforced strict Islamic laws, such as breaking the fingers of smokers, whipping those who drank alcohol, and banning shops from selling images of women. [...] An Iraqi woman from Ramadi said Al Qaeda banned women from driving or walking alone by themselves. AQI also abused local women, which antagonized {{some of the local}} tribes. Women, pretending to be seamstresses, were drafted to reconnoiter houses and report on the presence of Iraqi police in hiding. [...] If they could not find the police, they would <b>settle</b> <b>for</b> <b>killing</b> their close relatives. [...] They also murdered countless Iraqis: doctors, mullahs, college graduates, even women and children—anyone they thought might be connected to the Americans. In 2007, American Marines found several mass graves near Lake Tharthar containing a total of over 100 victims.|$|E
5000|$|Epilogue -However, Tyrone emerges {{one last}} time from the shadows without Jason’s help, now much larger and more demented looking than before. He mocks the {{audience}} for wanting to see him again, because that’s {{what people want to}} do with the devil—you want him, and then you want him to go away. This resulted in humanity killing the innocent, like sheep, lambs, and babies, before finally <b>settling</b> <b>for</b> <b>killing</b> the sweetest guy: Jesus. And humanity spends the last thousand years solving their problems by putting horns on them and watching their saviors burn. He disappears with one last warning to the audience: “The thing about a savior is you never know where to look. Might just be the place you saw the devil before.” ...|$|R
5000|$|However, Backhouse was {{not alone}} in his belief that the Japanese killed Pamela as revenge. Two other British diplomats in Peking at the time told {{historian}} P.D. Coates several decades later that it was theorised among them that the Japanese, unable to get to Fitzmaurice's wife since she rarely left the heavily guarded Legation Quarter, <b>settled</b> instead <b>for</b> <b>killing</b> Pamela since she was the daughter of a former British consul who was less secure. [...] "As you will know," [...] one of the former diplomats told Coates, by way of explaining the mutilation, [...] "there are traditions of this sort of thing in Bushido", the Japanese warrior code.|$|R
