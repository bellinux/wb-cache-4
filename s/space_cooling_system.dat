40|$|AbstractEffective {{thermal control}} systems are {{essential}} for reliable operation of spacecraft. A dual-driven intelligent combination control strategy is proposed to improve the temperate control and heat flux tracking effects. Both temperature regulation and heat flux tracking errors are employed to generate the final control action; their contributions are adaptively adjusted by a fuzzy fusing policy of control actions. To evaluate the control effects, describe a four-nodal mathematical model for analyzing the dynamic characteristics of the controlled heat pipe <b>space</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> (HP-SCS) consisting of an aluminum-ammonia heat pipe and a variable-emittance micro-electromechanical-system (MEMS) radiator. This dynamical model calculates the mass flow-rate and condensing pressure of the heat pipe working fluid directly from the systemic nodal temperatures, therefore, {{it is more suitable}} for control engineering applications.

Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the whole system that includes not only the room space with the windows and {{the electric}} lighting systems, but also the air conditioning system. For analysis of the whole system using different types of energy (i. e. electricity, solar radiation, light emitted by lamps and thermal energy), it is important to take into account the quality of these different types of energy.

40|$|The {{potential}} for cost-effective applica-tion of cool storage systems of one type or another exists in most buildings with a <b>space</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system.</b> Originally, cool storage technol-ogy {{was developed for}} integration with chilled water cooling systems that typically serve larger buildings. More recent cool storage develop-ments have included technologies designed for integration with roof-mounted, direct-expansion (DX) cooling systems. Residential-sized cool storage technologies, including smaller versions of the equipment designed for the roof-mounted DX application, have also been developed, but cost economies-of-scale {{have been difficult to}} overcome in the residential market. Although originally developed to shift electrical demand to off-peak periods (from an electric utility’s perspective) and to take advantage of low-cost off-peak electric rates (from an end-user’s perspective), many applications can also result in lower first costs and/or higher system efficiency compared to non-storage systems. Therefore, while a large differential between on-peak and off-peak kWh charges or a high demand charge definitely improves cool storage economics, cost-effective applications also exist without these ben-efits. Still, not every cooling system pre-sents a cost-effective application, so care-ful consideration of site-specific condi-tions is warranted to determine whether cool storage makes sense or not, which cool storage technol-ogy is best, and the optimum configu-ration for a specific technology...|$|E
40|$|Cool storage {{technology}} {{can be used to}} significantly reduce energy costs by allowing energy intensive, electrically driven cooling equipment to be predominantly operated during off-peak hours when electricity rates are lower. In addition, some system configurations may result in lower first costs and/or lower operating costs. Cool storage systems of one type or another could potentially be cost-effectively applied in most buildings with a <b>space</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system.</b> A survey of approximately 25 manufacturers providing cool storage systems or components identified several thousand current installations, but less than 1 % of these were at Federal facilities. With the Federal sector representing nearly 4 % of commercial building floor space and 5 % of commercial building energy use, Federal utilization would appear to be lagging. Although current applications are relatively few, the estimated potential annual savings from using cool storage in the Federal sector is $ 50 million. There are many different types of cool storage systems representing different combinations of storage media, charging mechanisms, and discharging mechanisms. The basic media options are water, ice, and eutectic salts. Ice systems can be further broken down into ice harvesting, ice-on-coil, ice slurry, and encapsulated ice options. Ice-on-coil systems may be internal melt or external melt and may be charged and discharged with refrigerant or a single-phase coolant (typically a water/glycol mixture). Independent of the technology choice, cool storage systems can be designed to provide full storage or partial storage, with load-leveling and demand-limiting options for partial storage. Finally, storage systems can be operated on a chiller-priority or storage priority basis whenever the cooling load is less than the design conditions. The first section describes the basic types of cool storage technologies and cooling system integration options. The next three sections define the savings potential in the Federal sector, present application advice, and describe the performance experience of specific Federal users. A step-by-step methodology illustrating how to evaluate cool storage options is presented next, followed by a case study of a GSA building using cool storage.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to develop}} solutions to relieve system stress conditions in electric grids. The approach adopted {{in this research}} {{is based on a}} new concept in the Smart Grid, namely, demand response optimization. A number of demand response programs with energy storage systems are designed to enable a community to achieve optimal demand side energy management. The proposed models aim to improve the utilization of the demand side energy through load management programs including peak shaving, load shifting, and valley lling. First, a model is proposed to nd the optimal capacity of the battery energy storage system (BESS) to be installed in a power system. This model also aims to design optimal switchable loads programs for a community. The penetration of the switchable loads versus the size of the BESS is investigated. Another model is developed to design an optimal load operation scheduling of a residential heating ventilation and air-conditioning system (HVACs). This model investigates the ability of HVACs to provide optimal demand response. The model also proposes a comfort/cost trade-os formulation for end users. A third model is proposed to incorporate the uncertainty of the photovoltaic power in a residential model. The model would nd the optimal utilization of the PV-output to supply the residential loads. In {{the first part of this}} research, mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations are proposed to obtain the optimal capacity of the (BESS) in a power system. Two optimization problems are investigated: (i) When the BESS is owned by a utility, the operation cost of generators and cost of battery will be minimized. Generator on/o states, dispatch level and battery power dispatch level will be determined for a 24 -hour period. (ii) When the BESS is owned by a community for peak shaving, the objective function will have a penalty component for the deviation of the importing power from the scheduled power. MIP problems are formulated and solved by CPLEX. The simulation results present the effect of switchable load penetration level on battery sizing parameters. In the second part, a mixed integer programming (MIP) based operation is proposed in this part for residential HVACs. The objective is to minimize the total cost of the HVAC energy consumption under varying electricity prices. A simplied model of a <b>space</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> considering thermal dynamics is adopted. The optimization problems consider 24 -hour operation of HVAC. Comfort/cost trade-o is modeled by introducing a binary variable. The big-M technique is adopted to obtain linear constraints while considering this binary variable. The MIP problems are solved by CPLEX. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of HVAC 2 ̆ 7 s ability to respond to varying electricity price. Then, in the final part of this research, two Benders Decomposition strategies are applied to solve a stochastic mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation to obtain the optimal sizing of a photovoltaic system (PV) and battery energy storage system (BESS) to power a residential HVACs. The uncertainty of PV output is modeled using stochastic scenarios with the probability of their occurrence. Total cost including HVAC energy consumption cost and PV/battery installation cost is to be minimized with the system at grid-connected mode over eight hours subject to a varying electricity price. The optimization problem will nd the optimal battery energy capacity, power limit, a number of PV to be installed, and expected HVAC on/o states and BESS charging/discharging states for the next eight hours.

40|$|As {{a member}} of the Space Suit Assembly Development Engineering Team, I {{designed}} and built test equipment systems to support the development of the next generation of advanced space suits. During space suit testing it is critical to supply the subject with two functions: (1) cooling to remove metabolic heat, and (2) breathing air to pressurize the space suit. The objective of my first project was to design, build, and certify an improved <b>Space</b> Suit <b>Cooling</b> <b>System</b> for manned testing in a 1 G environment. This design had to be portable and supply a minimum cooling rate of 2500 BTU/hr. The <b>Space</b> Suit <b>Cooling</b> <b>System</b> is a robust, portable system that supports very high metabolic rates. It has a highly adjustable cool rate and is equipped with digital instrumentation to monitor the flowrate and critical temperatures. It can supply a variable water temperature down to 34 deg., and it can generate a maximum water flowrate of 2. 5 LPM. My next project was to design and build a Breathing Air System that was capable of supply facility air to subjects wearing the Z 2 space suit. The system intakes 150 PSIG breathing air and regulates it to two operating pressures: 4. 3 and 8. 3 PSIG. It can also provide structural capabilities at 1. 5 x operating pressure: 6. 6 and 13. 2 PSIG, respectively. It has instrumentation to monitor flowrate, as well as inlet and outlet pressures. The system has a series of relief valves to fully protect itself in case of regulator failure. Both projects followed a similar design methodology. The first task was to perform research on existing concepts to develop a sufficient background knowledge. Then mathematical models were developed to size components and simulate system performance. Next, mechanical and electrical schematics were generated and presented at Design Reviews. After the systems were approved by the suit team, all the hardware components were specified and procured. The systems were then packaged, fabricated, and thoroughly tested. The next step was to certify the equipment for manned used, which included generating a Hazard Analysis and giving a presentation to the Test Readiness Review Board.

As {{an important part of}} the IT industry, data centres (DCs) have been rapidly growing in both the number and size over the past 40 years. Around 30 % to 40 % of electricity consumption in DCs is used for <b>space</b> <b>cooling,</b> thus leading to very inefficient DC operation. To identify ways to reduce the energy consumption for <b>space</b> <b>cooling</b> and increase the energy efficiency of DCs’ operation, a dedicated investigation into the energy usage in DCs has been undertaken and a novel high performance dew point <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> was introduced into a DC operational scheme. Based on the cooling load in DCs, a case study was carried out to evaluate the energy consumptions and energy usage effectiveness when using the novel dew point <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> in different scales of DCs in various climates. It was found that by using the novel dew point <b>cooling</b> <b>system,</b> for 10 typical climates a DC can have a much lower power usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1. 10 to 1. 22 compared to that of 1. 7 to 3. 7 by using existing traditional <b>cooling</b> <b>systems,</b> leading to significantly increased energy efficiency of the DC operation. In addition, the energy performance by managing the cooling air supply at the different levels in DCs, i. e., room, row and rack level, was simulated by using a dynamic computer model. It was found that cooling air supply at rack level can provide a higher energy efficiency in DCs. Based on the above work, the energy saving potential in DCs was conducted by comparing DCs using an the novel dew point <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and the optimum management scheme for the cooling air supply to that using traditional air <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> and the same supply air management. Annual electricity consumptions for the two cases were given. It was found that by using the novel dew point <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and optimum management <b>system</b> for the <b>cooling</b> air supply, an 87. 7 ~ 91. 6 % electricity consumption saving for <b>space</b> <b>cooling</b> in DCs could be achieved in 10 typical cities at 10 selected climatic conditions...|$|R

Besides theoretical investigations practical experience is required to evaluate the performance of solar cooling in the field. This document presents the main results from a solar cooling installation for canteen cooling, which is in operation since 2007. The data evaluation shows a seasonal electrical performance factor of 26. 1 for space heating and 6. 5 for <b>space</b> <b>cooling.</b> A seasonal thermal performance factor for cooling of 0. 4 has been determined...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a comprehensive numerical study on the thermal performance of an air based phase change thermal storage unit (TSU) for space heating. The unit is designed for integration into <b>space</b> heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>systems.</b> The unit consists of a number of one dimensional phase change material (PCM) slabs contained in a rectangular duct where air passes between the slabs. The numerical analysis was based on an experimentally validated model. A parametric study has been carried out including the study on the effects of charge and discharge temperature differences, air mass flow rate, slab thicknesses, air gaps and slab dimensions on the air outlet temperatures and heat transfer rates of the thermal storage unit. The paper introduces and discusses quantities called charge and discharge temperature differences which {{play an important role in}} the melting and freezing processes. ...|$|R

Its performance in providing power for <b>space</b> <b>cooling</b> has been analyzed. This solar <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is comprised of 53. 3 m 2 of XCPC trough collectors which are used to power a 23 kW double effect (LiBr) absorption chiller. This is the first system that combines both XCPC and absorption chilling technologies. Performance of the system was measured in both sunny and cloudy conditions, with both clean and dirty collectors. It was found that these collectors are well suited at providing thermal power to drive absorption <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> and that both the coinciding of available thermal power with cooling demand and {{the simplicity of the}} XCPC collectors compared to other solar thermal collectors makes them a highly attractive candidate for cooling projects...|$|R

A reference system, composed of a compression chiller and space heating and DHW driven by district heating, {{is used in the}} analysis. The different con gurations have been modelled using the Modelica modelling language and simulated as being in two different locations, Berlin and Madrid. These simulations have been carried out for a week in summer and a week in winter in order to identify the optimal con gurations and energetic performance in each location. The resulting analysis has shown that a system can be deemed unpro table when not well dimensioned and that pressure losses in the circuits are an important issue which is seldom unaccounted for...|$|R
