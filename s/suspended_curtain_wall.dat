40|$|AbstractThe <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> {{system is}} widely used in {{high-rise}} buildings because of its many advantages. With the increasing demands for building energy efficiency, thermal performance has become an important consideration in developing <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> systems. Even though the relative impact of the edge effect becomes more important as the thermal performance of glazing and the frame increases, the percentages of the frame out of the total <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> area have not been considered in evaluating its thermal transmittance. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to evaluate the effect of the frame ratio on the thermal transmittance of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system. The state of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> frame ratio is analyzed by investigating recently constructed office buildings. Eight cases of different frame ratios and three types of glazing U-values are selected, and the total thermal transmittance of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> (Ucw) for each case was calculated by using TRISCO 12. 0 W. This study found that when the higher frame ratio is applied to the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system, the thermal transmittance of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> is higher. Furthermore, the frame ratio has greater effect on the thermal transmittance of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> when high performance glazing is applied to the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system. It is recommended that the certificates of a <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system should show the frame ratio that was applied during testing or the accurate Ucw value considering actual frame ratio should be submitted for more reasonable building energy simulation...|$|R

However, there are many cases where the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> actually constructed was of narrow gauge, giving a point of reduction where the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> and turret wing walls join. To facilitate bonding with the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall,</b> wing walls were constructed longer at the base, and stepping inwards as they were built upwards. Turrets thought to have been constructed later in the plan were built with much shorter wing walls.|$|R

To design plus-energy <b>curtain</b> <b>walls,</b> design parameters of <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> are prioritized by sensitivity analysis and the most critical design parameters corresponding to specific energy efficient measures that bring major energy benefits with minor modifications are identified.

40|$|Metal <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> {{are widely}} used in {{commercial}} buildings and offer many advantages including space saving, high quality in manufacturing, light weight, significant aesthetic freedom, and rapid construction. However, their thermal performance is still low {{due to the fact}} that metal <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> consist of a large portion of glazing, and glass and metal are high heat conductors. In practice, metal <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> are referred to as "heat sink" in heating-dominant climate. The relatively low thermal resistance results in low surface temperature in cold winter, and thus may cause condensation and thermal discomfort problems in addition to high energy consumption. Initially, metal <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> grew within metal window industry and the current methodology and standards developed for evaluating window performance are also used for <b>curtain</b> <b>walls.</b> However, metal <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> differ from windows in that they have a much larger continuous glazing portion, more complex configuration and heat flow at the joints. Their overall performance depends on the interaction and integration of individual constituents as well as the performance of each component. However, the assessment of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> performance by existing standards is segmented and no study has addressed the overall thermal performance of <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> by treating them as integrated systems. The objective of this study is to evaluate the overall thermal performance of metal <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> using a developed holistic approach for the purpose of providing technical information on the improvement of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> design. A comprehensive research program has been designed and implemented to establish the overall performance of <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> by experimental testing, analytical and simulation studies. For the first time, extensive experimental testing has been conducted on full-scale specimen under field conditions reproduced in a large-scale environmental chamber. The two-story full-size specimen (3. 8 m by 6. 7 m) includes two commercially available <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> systems with different design details. The experimental program includes: (1) full-scale air leakage test, (2) thermal performance test, (3) measurement of local convection film coefficient, and, (4) measurement of local draft induced by <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> cold surface. The analytical and simulation studies include: (1) effect of design details on thermal transmittance using the simulation program FRAME, (2) effect of local film coefficients on the condensation resistance prediction using the simulation program FRAME, (3) effect of thermal performance of <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> on occupant thermal comfort and on energy consumption. Results from extensive testing and simulations have revealed the intricate links among the components, the overall wall assembly performance and the impact on the energy use and indoor comfort; and, therefore, provided solid technical information for manufacturers on the productive direction of future R&D and for designers on the selection of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> systems to achieve energy-efficient buildings with healthy and comfort indoor environment.

40|$|AbstractTo achieve {{national}} {{greenhouse gas}} {{reduction in the}} building sector, heating and cooling energy in buildings should be reduced. The government has strengthened regulations on insulation performance for building energy savings. However, the building envelope has various thermal bridges. In particular, a metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> comprises a number of thermal bridges at joints between the panels and the fixing units, thus degrading the overall thermal performance. To reduce building energy, {{it is necessary to}} reduce thermal bridges in building envelopes. This study aims to analyze the energy saving potential achieved by reducing thermal bridges. For this, the insulation performance and building energy needs of the existing and alternative metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> were evaluated. The alternative metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> that uses plastic molds at joints between panels and the thermally-broken brackets was suggested to reduce heat loss through thermal bridges. As results, the effective U-value of the alternative metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> was reduced by 72 % compared with the existing metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall.</b> In addition, annual heating energy needs of the alternative metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> building was reduced by 26 %, and annual total energy needs was reduced by 6 % because annual cooling energy needs of it slightly increased compared with the existing metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall.</b> In conclusion, the alternative metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> considerably influenced the savings in building energy needs by reducing thermal bridges...|$|R
