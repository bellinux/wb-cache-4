50|$|Loupes are an {{essential}} tool in both numismatics, {{the study of}} currency, and the related practice of coin collection. Coin collectors frequently employ loupes for better evaluation {{of the quality of}} their coins, since identifying <b>surface</b> <b>wear</b> is vital when attempting to classify the grade of a coin. Uncirculated coins (coins without wear) can command a substantial premium over coins with slight wear. This wear cannot always be seen with the naked eye. Numismatists can also employ loupes to identify some counterfeit coins that would pass a naked-eye visual inspection.|$|E
50|$|Many factors {{within the}} {{environment}} {{can affect the}} <b>surface</b> <b>wear</b> of adhesive tape. Even the prospect of rapidly changing environmental conditions can be enough to cause a failure in the substrate. For instance, rapid cooling can cause the substrate to shrink dramatically while the adhesive remains stationary. This pulling force can be enough to cause tears in the substrate decreasing the substrate's adhesion. Thus, substrate failure is predicated on {{the response of the}} substrate to various environmental conditions as well as the rate at which those conditions change. An adhesive tape applied in a moderate setting will experience a smaller range of temperatures than one applied in a hot desert. Substrate failure is largely predicated on Temperature changes as these are the most likely to occur and the most likely to affect the substrate in any large way.|$|E

5000|$|With vinyl records, {{there will}} be some loss in {{fidelity}} on each playing of the disc. This is due to the wear of the stylus in contact with the record surface. A good quality stylus, matched with a correctly set up pick-up arm, should cause minimal <b>surface</b> <b>wear.</b> Magnetic tapes, both analog and digital, wear from friction between the tape and the heads, guides, {{and other parts of the}} tape transport as the tape slides over them. The brown residue deposited on swabs during cleaning of a tape machine's tape path is actually particles of magnetic coating shed from tapes. Tapes can also suffer creasing, stretching, and frilling of the edges of the plastic tape base, particularly from low-quality or out-of-alignment tape decks. When a CD is played, there is no physical contact involved, and the data is read optically using a laser beam. Therefore, no such media deterioration takes place, and the CD will, with proper care, sound exactly the same every time it is played (discounting aging of the player and CD itself); however, this is a benefit of the optical system, not of digital recording, and the Laserdisc format enjoys the same non-contact benefit with analog optical signals. Recordable CDs slowly degrade with time, called disc rot, even if they are not played, and are stored properly. [...] A new compact disc was released called M-DISC which is said to last 1000 years. These discs are recordable and have a layer developed from stone. They come in CD, DVD and Blu-ray formats and various storage sizes. They can be used for music movies and data for computers etc.|$|E

The microstructures of the composites were studied using scanning electron microscopy and electron back scattered diffraction.

RHA particles refined the grains of the aluminum matrix and improved the wear resistance of the composite.
