[...] Filled kegs of butter were transported along the beach river by four-horse teams from the Mattole to Centerville or Port Kenyon and the teams returned supplies from Ferndale. [...] The eighty-one dairies from the southern area faded as the land along the Eel River Valley was settled for dairying, first by the Danes and later by other settlers. [...] In the 1880s multiple cooperative creameries in the Eel River valley began to process milk into butter; by 1904 the Central Creamery on Main Street Ferndale had combined the smaller operations into a more modern production facility. [...] The use of paper wrapping on butter to reduce air oxidizing the product was pioneered here at the suggestion of Chester E. Gray (1881-1944) from the U.S. Department of Agriculture who studied the problem of unrefrigerated fine butter turning white within hours of production. [...] Gray patented a new <b>spray-drying</b> process (U.S. Patent #858,868 - 1907 and #1,157,935 - 1915) and went into business with Central Creamery owner Aage Jensen in a new dry-milk manufacturing process to utilize non-fat milk solids which had formerly been waste of the process. [...] Their new plant processed 75,000 pounds of milk a day, shipping to San Francisco and filling contracts for the U.S. Navy.

Pigs were allotted by weight to eight replicates of five treatments with seven to eight pigs per pen. Pigs were {{assigned to one of}} five dietary treatments with 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100 % of the SDPP replaced with SDBM on an equal lysine basis. Therefore, diets contained 10, 7. 5, 5. 0, 2. 5, or 0 % SDPP combined with 0, 1. 63, 3. 25, 4. 8, or 6. 5 % SDBM, respectively. All phase I diets were formulated to contain 20 % dried whey, 1. 50 % lysine,. 81 % isoleucine, and. 37 % methionine. These diets were fed from d 0 to 14 postweaning. On d 14, all pigs were switched to a common phase II diet containing 10 % dried whey and 2. 5 % SDBM and was formulated to 1. 25 % lysine.

Amino acids of glycine (GLY), histidine (HIS) and leucine (LEU) were used as excipients to modify the <b>spray-dried</b> particles. It was demonstrated that the GLY-AZT <b>spray-dried</b> powders formed huge agglomerates with the size of 144. 51 [*]µm, which made it very difficult to be delivered to the lungs (FPF: 0. 29 % w/w only).

40|$|A {{total of}} 740 {{weanling}} pigs {{was used in}} three separate experiments to evaluate the effects of additions of <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma in the HNDD starter diet. In Trial 1, 534 weanling pigs (initially 14. 1 lb and 21 d of age) were used to evaluate various levels of <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma. Pigs were {{assigned to one of}} six experimental diets with either 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 % <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma replacing dried skim milk. Pigs were fed this diet for the first 14 days postweaning, when they were switched to a common phase II diet (d 14 to 28). During phase I (d 0 to 14), linear· and quadratic improvements occurred in average daily gain and average daily feed intake. No significant differences occurred in feed efficiency for any phase of the eXPeriment. In Trial 2, 68 weanling pigs (12. 7 lb and 21 d of age) were used to determine if supplemental methionine is needed for diets containing high levels of <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma. Pigs were fed identical diets containing 20 % dried whey, 7. 5 %spray-dried porcine plasma, and 1. 75 % <b>spray-dried</b> blood meal except that one diet contained 2 lblton supplemental DL-methionine. Pigs receiving diets containing supplemental methionine had improved average daily gain and average daily feed intake during the first week postweaning. Feed efficiency also was improved for the overall trial. In Trial 3, 144 weanling pigs (initially 12. 61 b and 19 d of age) were used in a 21 -d growth trial to evaluate two different sources of <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma. Pigs were assigned one of two diets containing 20 % dried whey and 10 % <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma. Pigs receiving the diet containing <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma obtained from source 1 had improved average daily gain for all phases of the eXPeriment and increased average daily feed intake for d 0 to 14 and d 0 to 21 compared to pigs fed the diet containing spraydried porcine plasma from source 2. There were no differences in feed efficiency. In conclusion, these trials demonstrate three key points concerning <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma: 1) starter pig performance is improved linearly with increasing levels of <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma through 10 % of the diet; 2) DL-methionine must be added to diets containing high levels of <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma to obtain optimal performance; and 3) there are differences in commercially available sources of <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma...|$|R

Objective 2 {{was to determine the}} appropriate level of dried whey for a phase II diet containing 2. 5 % <b>spray-dried</b> bovine blood meal. During phase I (d 0 - 7 postweaning), all pigs were fed a common high nutrient density pelletized diet containing 1. 5 % lysine, 20 % dried edible grade whey, 7. 5 % <b>spray-dried</b> porcine plasma, and 1. 75 % <b>spray-dried</b> bovine blood meal. All phase II diets were formulated to 1. 25 % lysine,. 9 % Ca, and. 8 % P. In the comparison of avian and bovine <b>spray-dried</b> blood meals, the diets contained 2. 5 % blood meal and 10 % whey. No significant differences occurred in average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), or feed to gain ratio (FIG) with use of avian and bovine <b>spray-dried</b> blood meal. The phase II diets comparing different whey levels contained 2. 5 % <b>spray-dried</b> bovine blood meal and whey levels of 5, 10, 15, or 20 % substituted for corn and soybean meal on a protein basis. Linear and quadratic improvements occurred in performance with increasing whey levels for the 21 d growth period. However, linear and quadratic increases in the cost per pound of gain also occurred. In conclusion, avian and bovine blood meal appear to be comparable sources of protein for the phase II diet. Current economics indicate that approximately 10 % whey is the optimal inclusion rate in phase II starter pig diets containing 2. 5 % <b>spray-dried</b> blood meal...|$|R

40|$|PPolyunsaturated {{fatty acids}}, {{especially}} long-chain polyunsaturated omega- 3 fatty acids (LCω 3 -PUFA), are essential in human nutrition because they {{play an important}} role in humans and prevent several diseases. Fish oil is a natural source of LCω 3 -PUFA that can be incorporated into food products. One of the major drawbacks of oils containing a high amount of LCω 3 -PUFA, such as fish oils, is their high susceptibility to oxidation and unpleasant flavours.

40|$|Whey protein {{concentrate}} {{is the main}} source of globular proteins in food products which are principally used as emulsifying, foaming and gelling ingredients. These whey proteins are commonly used in powder form obtained by a <b>spray-drying</b> process. It is well known that beta-lactoglobulin, the major protein component in whey, is greatly affected by heat treatments, with consequences on its adsorption properties at fluid-fluid interfaces. This study concerned four whey protein powders obtained using <b>spray-drying</b> at four different air inlet temperatures (from 170 to 260 degrees C), leading to different levels of protein solubility, denaturation and end-use properties. After evaluation of the protein denaturation by HPLC, the emulsifying properties were studied through particle size parameters and rheological properties in relation with <b>spray-drying</b> parameters. Our results indicated that oil-in-water emulsions, stabilized by 5 % (w/w) protein samples, exhibited a shear-thinning flow behaviour, and the harsher the <b>spray-drying</b> conditions (the higher the protein denaturation), the less viscous were the emulsions. The apparent viscosity of emulsions measured at 20 degrees C and 50 s(- 1) shear rate was around 0. 08 Pa s when containing whey proteins before drying, and around 0. 05 - 0. 018 Pa s after drying at air inlet temperatures from 170 to 260 degrees C. These differences in emulsion rheological properties were related to particle size effects, in regards to analysis of particle size distributions which showed a finer emulsion according to <b>spray-drying</b> intensity.
