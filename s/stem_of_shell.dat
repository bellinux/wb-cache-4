40|$|Although {{manufacturing}} of {{activated carbon}} from agricultural by-products by conventional heating {{has been investigated}} [1 ~ 3], yet, preparation of activated carbon from agricultural and forest waste by microwave irradiation has been scarcely reported. In this paper, the method of preparing activated carbon from 11 kinds of agricultural and forest waste such as sawdust, sugarcane bagasse, corncob, bamboo, wheat straw <b>stem</b> <b>of</b> beans, bean <b>shell,</b> sunflower shell, rice straw, waste materials of tannin extract with zinc chloride by microwave irradiation was studied. The results are shown in Table 1. According to the experimental data, four stages, preheating, drying, carbonization and activation in conventional processing can be completed only 6 - 13 min by microwave irradiation. The microwave processing is 23 - 50 {{times as fast as}} the conventional processing, and metylene blue decolorizing ability, pH, the amount of total Fe, chloride and ash of product come or exceed the first grade of powder activated carbon specified in standard (LY 216 - 79) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis article, a {{companion}} to the article by Philippe G. Ciarlet on the mathematical modelling <b>of</b> <b>shells</b> also {{in this issue of}} Acta Numerica, focuses on numerical issues raised by the analysis <b>of</b> <b>shells.</b> Finite element procedures are widely used in engineering practice to analyse the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> structures. However, the concept of 'shell finite element' is still somewhat fuzzy, as it may correspond to very different ideas and techniques in various actual implementations. In particular, a significant distinction can be made between shell elements that are obtained via the discretization <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> models, and shell elements - such as the general shell elements - derived from 3 D formulations using some kinematic assumptions, without the use <b>of</b> any <b>shell</b> theory. Our first objective in this paper is to give a unified perspective of these two families <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> elements. This is expected to be very useful as it paves the way for further thorough mathematical analyses <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> elements. A particularly important motivation for this is the understanding and treatment of the deficiencies associated with the analysis <b>of</b> thin <b>shells</b> (among which is the locking phenomenon). We then survey these deficiencies, in the framework of the asymptotic behaviour <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> models. We conclude the article by giving some detailed guidelines to numerically assess the performance <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> finite elements when faced with these pathological phenomena, which is essential for the design of improved procedures...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT In these experiments, 2560 {{eggs from}} {{commercial}} laying hens were examined {{to determine the}} effects of age of bird and season of the year on selected egg shell quality charac-teristics. Shell thickness was significantly lower in the summer months. Specific gravity was significantly higher in the younger birds and during the cooler seasons. Age and season significandy affected shell weight and percentage <b>of</b> <b>shell.</b> Shell weight increased with increasing age of bird while percentage <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> decreased. During the spring and summer months both shell weight and per-centage <b>of</b> <b>shell</b> decreased. Shell density was not significantly affected by age of bird but increased during the warmer months <b>of</b> the year. <b>Shell</b> weight per unit of egg surface area decreased during warmer months and no significant age effect was observed.
