40|$|An {{excimer laser}} {{incident}} on a metallic thin film {{is used to}} measure the adhesion between the film and the substrate. The initial optical absorption leads to electron excitation. After collisions and degradation of the excited electrons, the absorbed energy is transferred into various kinds of energy among which the major one is thermal.

The evaporated particles may recoil back to the surface constructing another shock wave to break the film.

All these effects cooperate to cause the cracking of the metallic thin film. This thesis provides the theoretical models to explain how the various mechanisms work on adhesion evaluation. Based on these understandings, the experimental data of laser ablation test is more suggestive and meaningful than the tape test which is sometimes ambiguous due to undiscerned effects.

This free-particle technique brings about nucleate boiling at a low degree of superheat by means of metal particles that are not fixed to the heated surface, but rather are free to move {{with respect to the}} surface. The effects of copper particles with sizes ranging from tens of nanometers to 9 mm on nucleate boiling heat transfer and critical heat flux (CHF) of the wetting dielectric fluid FC- 72 are investigated. Visualizations of the bubble nucleation characteristics due to the free particles are presented. Experimental results show that the introduction of microscale free particles onto a <b>superheated</b> <b>surface</b> effectively facilitates bubble nucleation and thus increases the nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficients. Millimeter-sized as well as nanoscale free particles do not have a strong effect on the boiling heat transfer performance of this wetting fluid. Introduction of a large quantity of microscale free particles reduces CHF by increasing the resistance to liquid replenishment and vapor departure; however, by properly selecting particle size and quantity, an improvement in both nucleate boiling heat transfer and CHF is observed. For the case where 0. 2 g of 10 μm-diameter free particles are placed on a polished copper surface, corresponding to a particle layer thickness of approximately 67 μm, the average nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficient is enhanced by 76. 3 % over the heat flux range of 10 to 159 kW/m 2, while CHF is increased by 10 %...|$|E

40|$|When {{a liquid}} drop {{is placed on}} a highly <b>superheated</b> <b>surface,</b> it can be levitated by its own vapour. This {{remarkable}} phenomenon {{is referred to as}} the Leidenfrost effect. The thermally insulating vapour film results in a severe reduction of the heat transfer rate compared to experiments at lower surface temperatures, where the drop is in direct contact with the solid surface. A commonly made assumption is that this solid surface is isothermal, which is at least questionable for materials of low thermal conductivity, resulting in an overestimation of the surface temperature and heat transfer for such systems. Here we aim to obtain more quantitative insight into how surface cooling affects the Leidenfrost effect. We develop a technique based on Mach-Zehnder interferometry to investigate the surface cooling of a quartz plate by a Leidenfrost drop. The three-dimensional plate temperature field is reconstructed from interferometric data by an Abel inversion method using a basis function expansion of the underlying temperature field. By this method we are able to quantitatively measure the local cooling inside the plate, which can be as strong as 80 K. We develop a numerical model which shows good agreement with experiments and enables extending the analysis beyond the experimental parameter space. Based on the numerical and experimental results we quantify the effect of surface cooling on the Leidenfrost phenomenon. By focusing on the role of the solid surface we provide new insights into the Leidenfrost effect and demonstrate how to adjust current models to account for non-isothermal solids and use previously obtained isothermal scaling laws for the neck thickness and evaporation rate.

40|$|When {{liquid is}} {{expelled}} by a vapor bubble {{growing at a}} nucleation site on a <b>superheated</b> <b>surface,</b> a thin microlayer underneath the bubble is left behind. It is evaporated from the free microlayer surface that provides for bubble growth. The average thickness of the microlayer determining the evaporation rate increases with time if the latter does not exceed a threshold value associated with the burn-out crisis. The bubble {{is described as a}} spherical segment with its flattened part adjoining the microlayer. This introduces two independent variables - the radius of the spherical part of the bubble surface and the polar angle that defines the relative area of the flattened part. They are to be found out from a set of two strongly nonlinear equations resulting from mass and momentum conservation laws. The first one depends on both microlayer thickness and nonmonotonously changing bubble base area. The second involves two major factors favoring bubble detachment - the buoyancy and a force due to the initial momentum of vapor input into the bubble. The former force depends on gravity whereas the latter one does not. It is why the limiting regimes of bubble evolution that correspond to normal or moderately reduced gravity and to microgravity feature drastically different properties. In the first case, the buoyancy dominates and the bubble evolves in such a manner as to become a full sphere at a moment that can be viewed as that of detachment. The detachment volume grows as gravity decreases. In the second case, the buoyancy is negligible and the bubble stays near the surface, while its volume continues to increase for a sufficiently long time. The findings are discussed in connection with experimental data obtained under different gravity conditions, some unpublished experiments being included. They help to understand why the pool boiling heat transfer coefficient frequently increases as gravity falls down and eventually vanishes...|$|E
40|$|Cold {{steady-state}} disk wind theory {{from near}} Keplerian accretion disks requires {{a large scale}} magnetic field at near equipartition strength. However the minimum magnetization has never been tested. We investigate the time evolution of an accretion disk threaded by a weak vertical magnetic field. The strength of the field is such that the disk magnetization falls off rapidly with radius. Four 2. 5 D numerical simulations of viscous resistive accretion disk are performed using the magnetohydrodynamic code PLUTO. In these simulations, a mean field approach is used and turbulence is assumed to give rise to anomalous transport coefficients (alpha prescription). The large scale magnetic field introduces only a small perturbation to the disk structure, with accretion driven by the dominant viscous torque. A super fast magnetosonic jet is observed to be launched from the innermost regions and remains stationary over more than 953 Keplerian orbits. The self-confined jet is launched from a finite radial zone in the disk which remains constant over time. Ejection is made possible because the magnetization reaches unity at the disk surface, due to the steep density decrease. However, no ejection is reported when the midplane magnetization becomes too small. The asymptotic jet velocity remains nevertheless too low to explain observed jets due to the negligible power carried away by the jet. Astrophysical disks with <b>superheated</b> <b>surface</b> layers could drive analogous outflows even if their midplane magnetization is low. Sufficient angular momentum would be extracted by the turbulent viscosity to allow the accretion process to continue. The magnetized outflows {{would be no more}} than byproducts, rather than a fundamental driver of accretion. However, if the midplane magnetization increases towards the center, a natural transition to an inner jet dominated disk could be achieved. Comment: Accepted by Astronomy and Astrophysic...|$|E

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} is {{developed}} {{to describe the}} evolution of a vapor bubble growing at a nucleation site on a <b>superheated</b> <b>surface</b> under arbitrary gravity. The bubble is separated from the surface by a thin microlayer and grows due to the evaporation from the microlayer interface. The average thickness of the microlayer increases as the bubble expands along the surface if the evaporation rate is lower than some critical value. The corresponding threshold value of the surface temperature has {{to be associated with the}} burn-out crisis. Two main reasons make for bubble separation, which are the buoyancy force and a force caused by the vapor momentum that comes to the bubble with vapor molecules. The latter force is somewhat diminished if condensation takes place at the upper bubble surface in subcooled liquids. The action of the said forces is opposed by inertia of the additional mass of liquid as the bubble center rises above the surface and by inertia of liquid being expelled by the growing bubble in radial directions. An extra pressure force arises due to the liquid inflow into the microlayer with a finite velocity. The last force helps in holding the bubble close to the surface during an initial stage of bubble evolution. Two limiting regimes with distinctly different properties can be singled out, depending on which of the forces that favor bubble detachment dominates. Under conditions of moderately reduced gravity, the situation is much the same as in normal gravity, although the bubble detachment volume increases as gravity diminishes. In microgravity, the buoyancy force is negligible. Then the bubble is capable of staying near the surface for a long time, with intensive evaporation from the microlayer. It suggests a drastic change in the physical mechanism of heat removal as gravity falls below a certain sufficiently low level. Inferences of the model and conclusions pertaining to effects caused on heat transfer processes by changes in bubble hydrodynamics induced by gravity are discussed in connection with experimental evidence, both available in current and in as yet unpublished literature...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} rates {{specific to}} nucleate pool boiling {{under various conditions}} {{are determined by the}} dynamics of vapour bubbles that are originated and grow at nucleation sites of a <b>superheated</b> <b>surface.</b> A new dynamic theory of these bubbles has been recently developed {{on the basis of the}} thermodynamics of irreversible processes. In contrast to other existing models based on empirically postulated equations for bubble growth and motion, this theory does not contain unwarrantable assumptions, and both the equations are rigorously derived within the framework of a unified approach. The conclusions of the theory are drastically different from those of the conventional models. The bubbles are shown to detach themselves under combined action of buoyancy and a surface tension force that is proven to add to buoyancy in bubble detachment, but not the other way round as is commonly presumed. The theory ensures a sound understanding of a number of so far unexplained phenomena, such as effect caused by gravity level and surface tension on the bubble growth rate and dependence of the bubble characteristics at detachment on the liquid thermophysical parameters and relevant temperature differences. The theoretical predictions are shown to be in a satisfactory qualitative and quantitative agreement with observations. When being applied to heat transfer at nucleate pool boiling, this bubble dynamic theory offers an opportunity to considerably improve the main formulae that are generally used to correlate experimental findings and to design boiling heat removal in various industrial applications. Moreover, the theory makes possible to pose and study a great deal of new problems of essential impact in practice. Two such problems are considered in detail. One problem concerns the development of a principally novel physical model for the first crisis of boiling. This model allows for evaluating critical boiling heat fluxes under various conditions, and in particular at different gravity levels, with a good agreement with experimental evidence. The other problem bears upon equilibrium shapes of a detached bubble near a heated surface in exceedingly low gravity. In low gravity or in weightlessness, the bubble can remain in the close vicinity of the surface for a long time, and its shape is greatly affected by the Marangoni effect due to both temperature and possible surfactant concentration being nonuniform along the interface. The bubble performs at these conditions like a heat pipe, with evaporation at the bubble lower boundary and condensation at its upper boundary, and ultimately ensures a substantial increase in heat removal as compared with that in normal gravity. Some other problems relevant to nucleate pool and forced convection boiling heat transfer are also discussed...|$|E

This invited contribution discusses techniques to calculate the molecular emission (and absorption) line spectrum based on models for the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks. Four examples of recent research illutrate these techniques in practice: matching resolved molecular-line emission from the disk around LkCa 15 with theoertical models for the chemistry; evaluating the two-dimensional transfer of ultraviolet radiation into the disk, and {{the effect on the}} HCN/CN ratio; far-infrared CO line emission from a <b>superheated</b> disk <b>surface</b> layer; and inward motions in the disk around L 1489 IRS.

30|$|In {{the limit}} of a {{perfectly}} wetting system, i.e., θ = 0 °, the superheat required {{would be the same}} as for homogeneous nucleation since ϕ = 1, while for an extreme non-wetting system, i.e., θ = 180 °, no superheat is required for spontaneous bubble growth from a microcavity since ϕ = 0. This relationship makes it possible to estimate the difference in <b>superheat</b> required for <b>surfaces</b> with two different contact angles assuming all other properties the same.|$|R
40|$|Artificial active {{sites were}} studied during {{nucleate}} pool boiling of degassed carbon tetrachloride. The {{pressure of the}} system was controlled a t one and also at one and one-half atmospheres. Dynamic two phase behavior in a cylindrical cavity was investigated visually. A glass capillary was inserted through the heat transfer surface and the bore supported ebullition {{in the absence of}} naturally occurring nuclei. When ebullition occurred at the surface, a falling liquid film was observed on the cavity wall. Three cylindrical cavities with diameters ranging from 0. 004 inches to 0. 008 inches were formed in a stainless steel heat transfer <b>surface.</b> The <b>surface</b> <b>superheat</b> required for ebullition ranged from 1. 5 °F to 43. 2 °F. For an appreciable range of superheats, the cavities were armed with vapor but did not support ebullition. Bubble columns were photographed using a high-speed motion picture camera. The diameter of detaching bubbles increased with higher <b>surface</b> <b>superheats.</b> Bubbles generated from the glass capillary had lower frequencies than those generated from stainless steel heating surfaces. The liquid flow around a detaching bubble assumed two modes. Axially symmetric pulsating flow and flow by continuous rotation about an active site were recognized by their effects on bubble shape...|$|R
40|$|The thermal death {{curve of}} dried spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus in {{saturated}} steam {{was characterized by}} three phases: (i) a sharp initial rise in viable count; (ii) a low rate of death which gradually increased; and (iii) logarithmic death at maximal rate. The first phase was a reflection of inadequate heat activation of the spore population. The second and third phases represented the characteristic thermal death curve of the spores in saturated steam. A jacketed steam sterilizer, equipped with a system for initial evacuation of the chamber, was examined for superheat during normal operation. Measurements of spore inactivation and temperature revealed <b>superheat</b> in <b>surface</b> layers of fabrics being processed in steam at 121 C. The high temperature of the fabric surfaces was attributed to absorption of excess heat energy from superheated steam. The superheated steam was produced {{at the beginning of}} the normal sterilizing cycle by transfer of heat from the steam-heated jacket to saturated steam entering the vessel...|$|R
