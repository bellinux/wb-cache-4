50|$|The term softbill {{is not a}} {{scientific}} one and has been used, and more often misused, in aviculture for numerous years. It is a very misleading title, as many species that fall into the category {{do not have a}} <b>soft</b> <b>bill</b> at all.|$|E

This new centre houses a hands on animal encounter hall in which both schools and general visitors are given the chance to hold bearded dragons, corn snake and a Chilean rose tarantula, while being given an educational talk about them. On the adjoining side there is also a museum which displays a variety of items which have been seized by HM customs at Heathrow Airport and donated to the park, a display of tribal artefacts (including genuine weaponry, tattoo kits and replica shrunken heads), displays of bones, feathers, eggs and fossils, along with an alligator skin which visitors are able to touch.|$|E

Small {{species such as}} pipi (Paphies australis) and large wedge shell (Macomona liliana) are eaten whole and crushed in the gizzard. For feeding on larger cockles such as Austrovenus stutchburyi (New Zealand cockle), at least some New Zealand teals have developed a peculiar technique, as of now undocumented in other birds, to force their rather <b>soft</b> <b>bills</b> between the cockle shells and tear out the flesh with a jackhammer-like pumping motion.

While Davis was fascinated and taken with the new sound Evans brought and the challenges it inspired, {{the remainder of the}} band, including Julian [...] "Cannonball" [...] Adderley, preferred Garland's harder, more rhythmic sound. In a 1960 column for Down Beat, Adderley elaborated on his initial reaction to the change, stating [...] "Especially when he started to use Bill Evans, Miles changed his style from very hard to a <b>softer</b> approach. <b>Bill</b> was brilliant in other areas, but he couldn't make the real things come off." [...] Despite his preference for a harder piano style, Adderley opened up to the new sound. He later used Bill Evans on a July 1958 session for his Portrait of Cannonball LP. Evans' unique piano sound and Davis' experiments with modal jazz would culminate on the 58 Sessions. Documented in a studio session from May 1958 at Columbia's 30th Street Studio and a live gig at the Plaza Hotel's Persian Room in September of that same year, these sessions marked the advent of Davis' new sextet, during what had already become a pivotal year for Davis.|$|R

40|$|Keywords: Ekbijakan, credit All {{companies}} {{engaged in}} manufacturing or service company aims to obtain maximum revenue by exploiting all {{the capabilities of}} the company. In accordance {{with a high level of}} competition then the company should conduct a careful planning in carrying out their business activities. So also for companies who derive income from the sale of its products. In order to support the desired sales growth, one way that can be taken is to increase the volume of sales, Gunawan (1997 : 92), by applying the system of credit sales in cash in addition to making sales. Sales of goods and services is a source of revenue for the company, cash sales, of course, will generate income in cash so that revenues can be used again to finance the company's activities. On the other hand, consumers prefer credit sales system, because the payment will feel lighter. The purpose of credit sales for the company which is to stimulate consumer interest. Credit sales here purposely done to expand or introduce the product into the market and at the same time to enlarge the volume of product sales. Companies can obtain additional profits by increasing sales volume. To increase the volume of sales, the company could implement a policy on credit sales, which include the wisdom of terms. Terms of credit or credit terms is an implied condition for the repayment of amounts due from customers. These conditions include the length of time credit and cash discount (cash discount) and other special requirements, Sartono (1999 : 433). Credit sales policy will affect the level of sales effectiveness in the future. Credit sales policy is a determination in the selection of credit, credit standards and credit terms, Sundjaja and Barlian (2003 : 272). Effectiveness is the ability of the company / organization to realize the expected target set, Halim (2002 : 128). Effectiveness is meant is the ability of the company in realizing its credit policy in the company to support sales levels, such as policies for dispensing credit period and cash discount (discounts) in the company. Credit sales policy in setting the period of credit and cash discount (discount) will also affect the rate of sales growth. It can be known with the change in period (term loans) is added to expected sales to rise, so does the discounted cash that is raised, subscriptions are expected to feel interested and the company could provide a rather <b>soft</b> <b>billing</b> policy that is billing day can be extended. Determination of an effective credit policy requires a careful calculation involves additional cost and additional profit to the various credit policy. Companies can increase the investment in accounts receivable if the additional profits obtained in the presence of these receivables are greater than the additional investment accounts.

In the sales system, the TNI Supplies Stores Saguanto Malang use the system with cash and credit sales. The system of credit sales generate receivables or rights billing. Wisdom of credit sales as part of efforts to deal with competition and to increase sales volume. One of these changes in credit conditions that are less effective to cause low levels of sales.

6000|$|Land {{birds on}} the pampas are few in species and in numbers. This may be {{accounted}} for by the absence of trees and other elevations on which birds prefer to roost and nest; and by the scarcity of food. Insects are few in dry situations; and the large perennial grasses, which occupy most of the ground, yield a miserable yearly harvest of a few minute seeds; so that this district is a poor one both for <b>soft</b> and hard <b>billed</b> birds. Hawks of several genera, in moderate numbers, are there, but generally keep to the marshes. Eagles and vultures are somewhat unworthily represented by carrion-hawks (Polyborinae); the lordly carancho, almost eagle-like in size, black and crested, with a very large, pale blue, hooked beak--his battle axe: and his humble follower and jackal, the brown and harrier-like chimango. These nest on the ground, are versatile in their habits, carrion-eaters, also killers on their own account, and, like wild dogs, sometimes hunt in bands, which gives them an advantage. They are the unfailing attendants of all flesh-hunters, human or feline; and also furiously pursue and persecute all eagles and true vultures that venture on that great sea of grass, to wander thereafter, for ever lost and harried, [...] "the Hagars and Ishmaels of their kind." ...|$|R
60|$|It was Mourner the Dove whom Peter saw, an {{old friend}} of whom Peter is very fond. His body was a little bigger than that of Welcome Robin, but his long slender neck, and longer tail and wings made him appear {{considerably}} larger. In shape he reminded Peter at once of the Pigeons up at Farmer Brown's. His back was grayish-brown, varying to bluish-gray. The crown and upper parts of his head were bluish-gray. His breast was reddish-buff, shading down into a <b>soft</b> buff. His <b>bill</b> was black and his feet red. The two middle feathers of his tail were longest and of the color of his back. The other feathers were slaty-gray with little black bands and tipped with white. On his wings were a few scattered black spots. Just under each ear was a black spot. But it was the sides of his slender neck which were the most beautiful part of Mourner. When untouched by the Jolly Little Sunbeams the neck feathers appeared to be in color very like his breast, but the moment they were touched by the Jolly Little Sunbeams they seemed to be constantly changing, which, as you know, is called iridescence. Altogether Mourner was lovely in a quiet way.|$|R
40|$|In many animals, an individual’s social {{environment}} and status can change quickly and unpredictably, suggesting an advantage for signals capable {{of responding to}} these changes. However, many signaling traits are fixed for relatively long periods. In birds, for example, most plumage-based signals are constrained by molt and unable to respond to sudden changes in {{social environment}}. Soft parts, conversely, are vascularized and may provide an alternative signaling system that can be updated relatively quickly. In this study, the effects of changes in breeding status are documented for a putative plumage-based signal, plumage brightness, and a putative <b>soft</b> part signal, <b>bill</b> darkness, in the red-backed fairy-wren Malurus melanocephalus. Males that switched from unpaired helper to paired breeder within a breeding season developed significantly darker bills within three weeks of the switch relative to males that did not change status. There was no clear corresponding change in plumage brightness, though the data suggests that changes in plumage brightness are at least possible. These results suggest that bill color is a socially mediated trait capable of responding rapidly to changes in breeding status, and it is proposed {{that the importance of}} soft parts as labile signals in birds may be currently under-appreciated.
