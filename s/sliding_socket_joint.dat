40|$|In {{ball and}} <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> where {{electrical}} insulator such as polytetrafluoroethylene {{is used as}} line to minimize friction, good electrical contact across joint may be needed for lightning protection or to prevent static-charge build-up. Electrical contact is maintained by ring of spring-loaded fingers mounted in socket. It {{may be useful in}} industry for cranes, trailers, and other applications requiring ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint...</b>|$|R

5000|$|... {{synovial}} joint (also {{known as a}} diarthrosis) - freely movable. Synovial joints can in turn be classified into six groups according {{to the type of}} movement they allow: plane <b>joint,</b> ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint,</b> hinge joint, pivot joint, condyloid joint and saddle joint.|$|R
500|$|... {{refers to}} a conical {{movement}} of a body part, such as a ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> or the eye. Circumduction {{is a combination of}} flexion, extension, adduction and abduction. Circumduction can be best performed at ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joints,</b> such as the hip and shoulder, but may also be performed by {{other parts of the body}} such as fingers, hands, feet, and head. For example, circumduction occurs when spinning the arm when performing a serve in tennis or bowling a cricket ball.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a Ellipsoid joint is the wrist; it {{functions}} similarly to the ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> except is unable to move 360 degrees.|$|R
50|$|Two general {{types of}} ground glass joints are fairly {{commonly}} used: joints which are slightly conically tapered and ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joints</b> (sometimes called spherical joints).|$|R
50|$|In contrast, spherical joints (or {{ball and}} <b>socket</b> <b>joints)</b> {{such as the}} hip joint permit {{rotation}} and all other directional movement, while pivot joints only permit rotation.|$|R
5000|$|It should {{connect with}} the {{shoulder}} in a ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint,</b> {{this is the only}} joint in the front limb that is capable of side-to-side movement.|$|R

50|$|A {{beam compass}} is a compass with a beam and <b>sliding</b> <b>sockets</b> or cursors for drawing and {{dividing}} circles {{larger than those}} made by a regular pair of compasses. The instrument can be as a whole, or made on the spot with individual sockets (called trammel points) and any suitable beam.|$|R
30|$|Especially in {{the most}} severe knee {{deformity}} with aplasia of the cruciate ligament and ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> configuration, the frontal plane instability can lead to recurrence of axial malalignment after deformity correction [13].|$|R
50|$|Shoulder {{arthritis}} {{can be one}} {{of three}} types of arthritis in the glenohumeral joint of the shoulder. The glenohumeral joint is a ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint,</b> which relies on cartilage to move smoothly and to operate normally.|$|R
5|$|The {{bones and}} joints form a {{mechanical}} structure with features comparable to hinges, mortice and tenon and ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joints,</b> etc, to provide both support and suitable flexibility. He compares the spine to The Iron Bridge at Bishop Wearmouth.|$|R
30|$|The {{limitations}} of lengthening nails {{should be kept}} in mind, as severe cruciate aplasia and joint incongruity (ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint)</b> can lead to subluxation. Cases of subluxation during lengthening with motorised intramedullary lengthening nails have been reported [16, 28].|$|R
50|$|The {{bones and}} joints form a {{mechanical}} structure with features comparable to hinges, mortice and tenon and ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joints,</b> etc, to provide both support and suitable flexibility. He compares the spine to The Iron Bridge at Bishop Wearmouth.|$|R
50|$|The single bone in {{the thigh}} {{is called the}} femur. This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high {{proportion}} of cortical bone), and forms a ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> at the hip, and a modified hinge joint at the knee.|$|R
50|$|The post-1957 piston is {{coated with}} copper {{on the inside}} and top. This was done to prevent the nitrile {{hardening}} process from hardening the ball <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> area. The outside wall of the piston was then finely machined and polished to produce a chromed appearance.|$|R
50|$|Spigot and sockets {{involve a}} normal pipe end, the spigot, being {{inserted}} into the socket or bell of another pipe or fitting with a seal being made between the two within the socket. Normal spigot and <b>socket</b> <b>joints</b> do not allow direct metal to metal contact with all forces being transmitted through the elastomeric seal. They can consequently flex and allow some degree of rotation, allowing pipes to shift and relieve stresses imposed by soil movement. The corollary is that unrestrained spigot and <b>socket</b> <b>joints</b> transmit essentially no compression or tension along the axis of the pipe and little shear. Any bends, tees or valves therefore require either a restrained joint or, more commonly, thrust blocks, which transmit the forces as compression into the surrounding soil.|$|R
50|$|The {{steam pipes}} were routed {{across the front}} tube-plates into {{fittings}} which formed a prolongation of the bottom part of the smokeboxes. From there, steam passed through a swivelling and sliding joint to the cylinders. The exhaust pipes back to the smokeboxes were equipped with ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{there are}} {{numerous}} variations, stockless anchors consist {{of a set of}} heavy flukes connected by a pivot or ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> to a shank. Cast into the crown of the anchor is a set of tripping palms, projections that drag on the bottom, forcing the main flukes to dig in.|$|R
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is biocompatible (non-toxic and not {{rejected by}} the body), it has many medical uses, including surgical implements and implants, such as hip balls and <b>sockets</b> (<b>joint</b> replacement) and dental implants that can stay in place for up to 20 years. The titanium is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium or 6% Al and 4% vanadium.|$|R
50|$|Early {{underwater}} lights were fixed electric flood lamps or portable lamps with dry batteries {{for use by}} divers in standard diving dress. Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd developed a model of portable lamp with a parabolic lens and attached to the divers corselet via a ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> allowing the diver to use both hands while working.|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} {{exposes the}} head {{section of the}} femur bone (the ball of the ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint),</b> and then the head is removed using a small saw or a bone hammer and chisel. Rarely both sides are done in one operation, most times one side is done and allowed to heal before {{the other side is}} done.|$|R
50|$|The pack has two levers, rigidly {{connected}} to the engine installation. Pressing on these levers, the pilot deflects the nozzles back, and the pack flies forward. Accordingly, raising this lever makes the pack move back. It is possible to lean the engine installation to the sides (because of the ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint)</b> to fly sideways.|$|R
50|$|The {{shoulder}} joint (or glenohumeral joint from Greek glene, eyeball, + -oid, 'form of', + Latin humerus, shoulder) is structurally {{classified as a}} synovial ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> and functionally as a diarthrosis and multiaxial joint. It involves articulation between the glenoid cavity of the scapula (shoulder blade) {{and the head of}} the humerus (upper arm bone).|$|R
50|$|Spines are {{ossicles}} {{that project}} {{from the body}} wall and articulate with other ossicles through ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joints</b> mounted on tubercles. They are formed from crystals of calcite and can be solid or hollow, long or short, thick or thin and sharp or blunt. The spines serve a protective function and are also used for locomotion.|$|R
50|$|The intake ports are narrow {{enough to}} ensure that piston rings {{do not need to}} be pegged. Instead of using a gudgeon pin, each piston is {{connected}} to its connecting rod via a ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint,</b> to enable the piston to rotate. This feature has been abandoned for the Gen-2 version in favour of conventional gudgeon pins.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shape of}} {{the ends of the}} bonesâ€”Some joints {{normally}} have a large range of movement, such as the shoulder and hip. Both are ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joints.</b> If a shallow rather than a deep socket is inherited, a relatively large range of movement will be possible. If the socket is particularly shallow, then the joint may dislocate easily.|$|R
40|$|Building {{automobile}} {{bodies from}} lightweight materials using space-frame construction techniques is increasingly popular because of exhaust emission legislation. One proposed method of achieving {{this is by}} using plug and <b>socket</b> <b>joints,</b> which are injected with adhesive after assembly. A method for controlling this process, irrespective of component tolerances, is proposed here. A test rig representing a plug and <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> was injected with the adhesive and a method for successfully filling the butt-jointed end of the joint found. The addition of a restriction to the joint's open end gave a method of filling the cavity without creating any air gaps. The use of neoprene O-ring seals for creating the restriction was investigated. The pressure of the adhesive at the joint inlet (gate) was recorded (data logger), and an analysis {{of this has been}} used to determine the point when adhesive injection can be arrested and the joint correctly filled...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”We {{present a}} novel design for {{connecting}} {{pieces of a}} computationally enhanced construction kit, an optocoupled ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint.</b> Unlike other existing connectors, our joint is poseable and allows both the topology and dynamic configuration of a kit assembly to be sensed. We provide a survey of existing computationally enhanced construction kit connectors and describe the technical details of our design. I...|$|R
50|$|The {{ball and}} <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> (or {{spheroidal}} joint) {{is a type}} of synovial joint in which the ball-shaped surface of one rounded bone fits into the cup-like depression of another bone. The distal bone is capable of motion around an indefinite number of axes, which have one common center. It enables the bone to move in many places (nearly all directions).|$|R
50|$|By 28 February 1815 Stephenson {{had made}} enough {{improvements}} {{to file a}} patent with the overseer of the colliery, Ralph Dodds. This specified direct communication between cylinder and wheels using a ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint.</b> The drive wheels were connected by chains, which were abandoned {{after a few years}} in favour of direct connections. A new locomotive constructed on these principles was put into operation.|$|R
