25|$|Twenty {{acres of}} fields around {{the centre of}} the hamlet of Little Langdale were {{designated}} a SSSI in 1989 as one of the only four remaining meadows of SSSI quality in South Cumbria. The habitat varies from floodplain near the Brathay to higher, dryer haymeadow with both being home {{to a wide variety of}} herb, grass and flower species. Grasses found in these meadows include <b>sweet</b> <b>vernal-grass,</b> wood-crane's-bill, common bent, crested dog's tail, red fescue, meadow fescue, Yorkshire-fog, smooth meadow-grass, rough meadow-grass, cock's-foot, soft brome and perennial rye-grass. Perhaps the rarest species found there is the globe-flower.|$|E
25|$|The nearby meadows at Plaster's Green Meadows are {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest {{because it is an}} area of unimproved and traditionally managed species-rich meadows which support a neutral grassland community of a type which is now rare throughout Britain. The site is situated on the slopes fringing the Lias Tablelands and is underlain by Rhaetic clays and, lower down the slope Keuper Red Marl. The slowly permeable clay soils are slightly calcareous in nature and this is reflected in elements of the flora. The site is characterised by the nationally rare Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and Crested Dog’s-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and dominant grasses include <b>Sweet</b> <b>Vernal-grass</b> (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Crested Dog’s-tail and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus), while Quaking Grass (Briza media) and Yellow Oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) are also frequent. There is a high component of herb species throughout the meadows including Saw-wort (Serratuta tinctoria), Dyer’s Greenweed (Genista tinctoria), Common Knapweed, Pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus), Devil’s-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), Betony (Stachys officinalis) and Spiny Restharrow (Ononis spinosa). The calcareous nature of the soil is reflected by the presence of Cowslip (Primula veris), Fairy Flax (Linum catharticum), Glaucous Sedge (Carex flacca), Lady’s Bedstraw (Galium verum) and occasional Salad Burnet (Sanguisorba minor). The meadows are bounded by hedges supporting numerous species including Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), Wych Elm (Ulmus glabra), English Elm (Ulmus procera), Hazel (Corylus avellana) and Field Maple (Acer campestre).
