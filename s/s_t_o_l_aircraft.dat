The study follows an action research model, where the participants’ evaluations are used in the planning of the practice, and the changes the student makes based on the evaluations are given special attention. The results shows several shifts in the student’s methodological and theoretical perspective, leading to a discussion about terms as participation, freedom and relation, in addition to focusing on the consequences of having a practice with mandatory attendance. In order to understand the practice and its development, several theories are used, including Hannah Arendt’s definition of human action, the Bildung tradition, sociomusicology and music therapy theory. The thesis concludes with reflections about whether music therapy should be targeted towards the especially interested, or if the discipline should look towards areas of practice where the clients are not necessarily gathered because of their interest in music...|$|R

Three acidic active principles [1, 2, 3] were isolated from it, namely pseudolaric acid A (l), B (2) and C (3). They have not only antifungal activity but also a significant effect on the termination of early pregnancy in rats, rabbits and dogs [4]. The structures of the three pseudolaric acids were elucidated dy spectroscopic analysis and X-ray diffraction, and found to be diterpenic acids with a trans fused hydroazulene skeleton. It is of special interest that the tertiary acetoxy group (or hydroxyl group) was trans to the lactonyl group.

40|$|A {{method to}} {{retrieve}} soil moisture (SM) from Advanced Scanning Microwave Radiometer—Earth Observing System Sensor (AMSR-E) observations using Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Level 3 SM {{as a reference}} is discussed. The goal is to obtain longer time series of SM with no significant bias and with a similar dynamical range {{to that of the}} SMOS SM dataset. This method consists of training a neural network (NN) to obtain a global non-linear relationship linking AMSR-E brightness temperatures (T b) to the SMOS L 3 SM dataset on the concurrent mission period of 1. 5 years. Then, the NN model is used to derive soil moisture from past AMSR-E observations. It is shown that in spite of the different frequencies and sensing depths of AMSR-E and SMOS, it is possible to find such a global relationship. The sensitivity of AMSR-E T b ’s to soil temperature (<b>T</b> <b>s</b> <b>o</b> i <b>l)</b> was also evaluated using European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast Interim/Land re-analysis (ERA-Land) and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications-Land (MERRA-Land) model data. The best combination of AMSR-E T b ’s to retrieve <b>T</b> <b>s</b> <b>o</b> i <b>l</b> is H polarization at 23 and 36 GHz plus V polarization at 36 GHz. Regarding SM, several combinations of input data show a similar performance in retrieving SM. One NN that uses C and X bands and <b>T</b> <b>s</b> <b>o</b> i <b>l</b> information was chosen to obtain SM in the 2003 – 2011 period. The new dataset shows a low bias (< 0. 02 m 3 /m 3) and low standard deviation of the difference (< 0. 04 m 3 /m 3) with respect to SMOS L 3 SM over most of the globe’s surface. The new dataset was evaluated together with other AMSR-E SM datasets and the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SM dataset against the MERRA-Land and ERA-Land models for the 2003 – 2011 period. All datasets show a significant bias with respect to models for boreal regions and high correlations over regions other than the tropical and boreal forest. All of the global SM datasets including AMSR-E NN were also evaluated against a large number of in situ measurements over four continents. Over Australia, all datasets show a strong level of agreement with in situ measurements. Models perform better over Europe and mountainous regions in North America.

Pretreatment with rapamycin (2 ng/ml) for 48 h inhibited PDGF-induced migration (PDGF BB homodimer; 20 ng/ml) in cultured rat and human SMC (n = 10; P < 0. 0001), whereas FK 506 had no significant effect on migration. Rapamycin administered orally (1 mg/kg per d for 7 d) significantly inhibited porcine aortic SMC migration compared with control (n = 15; P < 0. 0001).

40|$|This study {{traces the}} p <b>o</b> <b>l</b> i <b>t</b> i c a l, {{economic}} and administrative {{history of the}} duchy of Cornwall from 1500 until abolished {{by the government in}} I 650. It held an Important, though autonomous place in the early Tudor constitution. Henry VII consolidated i <b>t</b> <b>s</b> p <b>o</b> <b>l</b> i <b>t</b> i c a l and economic dominance of southwestern England by reorganisation of i <b>t</b> <b>s</b> administrative structure to ensure that effective authority devolved from the monarch to the Warden of the stannaries, the duchy's principal officer. Henry VIII extended the duchy's influence in the Southwest in 1540 by significantly augmenting its landed estates in Cornwall. In the early-modem period the duchy contributed financially and p <b>o</b> <b>l</b> i <b>t</b> i c a l l y to the Tudor and Stuart polity. Revenues derived from estates located within a l l the geographical areas of England south of the Trent and tax derived from the assaying and weighing of t i n produced in Devon and Cornwall, provided a lucrative Income. The Tudors u t i l i s e d the rich source of patronage which the duchy offered to reward and honour prominent local men as well as courtiers. The most Influential Cornish families dominated i <b>t</b> <b>s</b> affairs in the Southwest through the sixteenth century. In contrast to the Tudor regime, James I determined that the duchy must primarily serve as a financial agency to support the heir to the throne. First under Prince Henry and after I 616, under Prince Charles, policies were evolved to increase landed income. Elizabeth had granted a monopoly for buying t i n, but this ill-conceived experiment f a i l e d. James opted for a scheme run by the duchy. This was financially successful, but lack of capital forced the crown again to s e l l the monopoly to London mercantile Interests. Hov;ever, successive grants produced a greatly enhanced income. The Stuart princes also introduced a Council which quickly assumed control of the duchy. Composed of duchy servants, members of the Princes' households and legal advisers, i t administered every facet of i <b>t</b> <b>s</b> affairs and acted :^as a court of appeal for duchy tenants. The Warden of the stannaries was excluded and Cornish families lost much of their influence. Acting upon carefully prepared surveys of duchy lands, i t increased net income more than threefold vrithin a decade. The revenue devices employed by this Council resemble those employed in the l 630 's, the era of personal rule. The duchy also provided p <b>o</b> <b>l</b> i <b>t</b> i c a l patronage. When Edward VI and Queen Xary extended the p <b>o</b> <b>l</b> i <b>t</b> i c a l franchise in Cornvxall, i t became the most represented county in Parliament. The duchy was then able to influence the small, poor boroughs tied to i t economically. However, this was not undertaken systematically until after l 6 l 4, when l i <b>s</b> <b>t</b> <b>s</b> of duchy candidates were successfully recommended to fourteen Cornish boroughs for most of the Parliaments before l 640...|$|R

Patient demographics, stone free rate (SFR), and complications were all reported and analyzed. Results In patients with residual stones (group I) vs those who were (group II) stone free the median (IQR) of GSS was 2 (2 - 3) and 2 (1 - 2), CROES nomogram score was 215 (210 - 235) and 257 (240 - 264), and <b>S.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>O.</b> N.

We conclude tha t changes in living arrangement had no dramatic effect on the poverty r a t e of elderly women. Poor women who live in the households of other relatives a re better off than those who live alone. But because some poor women in 1950 lived alone, holding living arrangements unchanged over the 30 year period would not have reduced poverty by a large amount. Poverty would have fallen by an additional 4. 2 percentage points (or by another 8 percent) between 1950 and 1980 i f living arrangements and the age composition of women 60 years of age and older had not changed, and by only an additional 2. 2 percentage points if propensities of the poor and nonpoor <b>t</b> <b>o</b> <b>l</b> ive alone had remained unchanged. Personal incomes of women grew rapidly over th i s period, but their init ially low incomes rather than changes in household composition modified the effect of th i s growth on poverty rates.

40|$|The most {{significant}} coastal aquifers in Greece are primarily those developed in carbon-ate formations and, secondly, those developed in deposits of Neogene and Quaternary sediments. Carbonate formations are extensive and cover 35 - 40 % of the country. They are distributed {{mainly in the}} central, western and southern parts of Greece and have been f r a c t u red by intense t ctonic activity. These formations are karstified and hold major aquifers in most cases open to the sea. Due to physical mechanisms and anthro p o g e n i c i n t e rventions in the environment, large quantities of groundwater have deteriorated in quality due to seawater encroachment, depending on the hydrogeological and hydraulic characteristics of the aquifers. Long dry periods {{also contribute to the}} reduction of g roundwater quality. The coastal aquifers most sensitive to water regime changes are karstic ones. Although this type of aquifer may provide important quantities of gro u n d-w a t e r, as for example in mainland Greece, Peloponnesus and Crete, groundwater alre a d y degraded by physical mechanisms, encroaches inland for long distances when overe x-ploited. If the groundwater regime is re <b>s</b> <b>t</b> <b>o</b> red, groundwater quality also re <b>s</b> <b>t</b> <b>o</b> es quickly.

A total of 160 patients who had staghorn renal stones and underwent PCNL between January 2012 and August 2015 were included in the current retrospective study. Guy, <b>S.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>O.</b> N. E., S-ReSC (Seoul National University Renal Stone Complexity) and CROES (Clinical Research Office of the Endourological Society) nephrolithometry scores were calculated for each patient, and their potential association with stone-free status, operative and fluoroscopy time, and length of hospital stay (LOS) were evaluated. Postoperative complications were graded according to the modified Clavien classification, and the correlation of scoring systems with postoperative complications was also investigated. The mean CROES, <b>S.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>O.</b> N. E, Guy and S-ReSC scores were 143. 5  ±  33. 6, 9. 7  ±  1. 6, 3. 5  ±  0. 5 and 6. 2  ±  2. 0 respectively. The overall stone-free rate was 59 %. All scoring systems were significantly correlated with stone-free status in univariate analysis. However, Guy and S-ReSC scores were the only significant independent predictor in multivariate analysis. And all four nomograms failed to predict complication rates. Current study demonstrated that Guy and S-ReSC scoring systems could effectively predict postoperative stone-free status for staghorn stones. However all four scoring systems failed to predict complication rates...|$|R
