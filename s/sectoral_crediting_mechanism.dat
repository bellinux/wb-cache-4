Using the method of conjoint analysis, this paper evaluates corporate preferences for policy alternatives of the <b>sectoral</b> <b>crediting</b> <b>mechanism</b> aiming at supporting its discussions and development. Data were collected from 94 companies in all 11 prefecture-level cities of Shanxi province, China. The results confirm that companies are most concerned about three policy attributes; domestic policy instruments, {{the relationship with the}} clean developing mechanism, and the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities. From the viewpoint of the Chinese businesses surveyed, the ideal policy alternative has a domestic policy instrument in which installations with voluntary targets receive tradable units, while co-existing with the clean developing mechanism, and providing opportunities to get financial and technical assistance from developed countries. Meanwhile, the coverage of the <b>sectoral</b> <b>crediting</b> <b>mechanism</b> could be expanded to small companies that are the most inefficient and thus have the lowest abatement costs in some sectors. The results of this study are important in light of ongoing discussions and developments of the <b>sectoral</b> <b>crediting</b> <b>mechanism</b> in China...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the relationship between}} economic growth and emissions of eight environmental air pollutants (carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur oxide (SOx), carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile organic compound (NMVOC), and ammonia (NH 3)) in 39 countries from 1995 to 2009. We tested an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for 16 individual industry sectors and for the total industrial sector. The results clarified that at least ten individual industries {{do not have an}} EKC relationship in eight air pollutants even though this relationship was observed in the country and total industrial sector level data. We found that the key industries that dictated the EKC relationship in the country and the total industrial sector existed in CO 2, N 2 O, CO, and NMVOC emissions. Finally, the EKC turning point and the relationship between economic development and trends of air pollutant emissions differ among industries according to the pollution substances. These results suggest inducing new environmental policy design such as the <b>sectoral</b> <b>crediting</b> <b>mechanism,</b> which focuses on the industrial characteristics of emissions...|$|E

The analysis shows that the environmental prospects systematically improve in a transition from the Clean Development Mechanism projects towards a global carbon market, while the opposite is foreseen for the economic costs.

40|$|The Cancun Agreements in December 2010 {{have set}} {{the basis for the}} {{continuing}} availability of market mechanisms to assist developed countries in meeting their mitigation commitments in a post- 2010 climate regime. They provide that the introduction of new Market Based Mechanisms ("NMMs") will be examined at the next COP in Durban. NMMs refer, in particular, to sector based crediting. There is not yet sufficient consensus on how new market mechanisms could be governed and which role the United Nations ("UN") should play. While some countries including Japan and Australia favour more decentralized governance models with only minimum criteria defined by the UN and a strong role for bilateral cooperation, the EU still has a preference for more centralized UN based governance. This paper gives an overview of current country positions, discusses pro and cons of different accounting and governance frameworks for NNMs, and examines inasmuch the Clean Development Mechanism ("CDM") provides a suitable model for centrally governed <b>sectoral</b> <b>crediting</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> It concludes that even if decentralized approaches also have their strengths compared to centralized governance models, minimum requirements need to be agreed upon under the UN to guarantee the environmental integrity of the mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the cost of}} a range of national, regional and global mitigation policies and the corresponding incentives for countries to participate in ambitious international mitigation actions. The paper illustrates the scope for available instruments to strengthen these incentives and discusses ways to overcome barriers to the development of an international carbon price, based on the quantitative assessment from two global and sectorially-disaggregated CGE models. Key step towards the emergence of a single international carbon price will most likely involve the phasing out of subsidies of fossil fuel consumption and various forms of linking between regional carbon markets, ranging from direct linking of existing emission trading systems to more indirect forms through the use of <b>sectoral</b> <b>crediting</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The paper also discusses regulatory issues raised by the expansion of emission trading and crediting schemes as well as the complementary contribution of non-market based instruments such as the imposition of technical standards and R&D policies. Finally, the paper emphasises the important role of international transfers, not least to overcome the relatively strong economic incentives in some countries to free ride on other regions mitigation actions. While they can take various explicit or implicit forms, transfers made primarily through market mechanisms, for instance via the allocation of binding emission reduction commitments across countries, would be most cost-effective...|$|R
40|$|This thesis, which {{consists}} of five papers, addresses two themes related {{to the need for}} a scale-up of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction in the energy sector in developing countries: (1) approaches to support developing countries in scaling-up emissions reduction, and (2) an approach to scale-up emissions reduction [...] cultivation of fuel wood to replace fossil fuels in electricity generation. In the first paper, the potential volume of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions reduction and reduction credits in the electricity sector under a <b>sectoral</b> <b>crediting</b> <b>mechanism</b> based on a sectoral no-lose, non-binding, target in the post- 2012 period is assessed for seven high-emitting developing countries by means of different scenarios. To do this assessment, an approach for setting national emissions intensity baselines and targets in the sector is developed. The assessment shows that a significant scale-up of emissions reduction could be achieved in the sector by boosting the efficiency of coal power plants and decreasing the share of coal-based electricity in new generation capacity in the seven countries. Given the set crediting targets, substantial volumes of annual credits could be generated. In the second paper, a hypothesis that carbon credits sale is not a decisive factor for the development of biomass power projects under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is tested by an empirical analysis using two objective indicators and by an econometric analysis. A decisive factor is also identified using the econometric analysis. The empirical analysis shows that there are indications that carbon credits sale is not a decisive factor {{for the development of a}} substantial share of registered CDM bagasse power projects in Brazil and India. The result from the econometric analysis supports the hypothesis. More important than crediting the emissions reduction is allowing access to the national electricity grid to sell electricity. This suggests that supporting developing countries in implementing policies and regulations which enable biomass power developers to sell electricity to the grid at an attractive price could greatly accelerate the development of biomass power projects. The third paper addresses a need for an approach to credit the national biofuel programs in developing countries for their benefit of reducing CO 2 emissions rather than crediting just CDM biofuel projects. In this paper, the impact of achieving the target of the national ethanol program in Thailand of replacing all conventional gasoline with gasoline containing ethanol at 10 % by volume (gasohol) by 2012 is assessed. The assessment shows that the program could lead to a significant increase in self-sufficiency of gasoline and a significant CO 2 emissions reduction. The program could also entail a land-use change (i. e., displacement of areas of food crops). The annual average cost of substituting gasohol for gasoline per ton of CO 2 emission reduction is estimated to be higher than the current carbon price. The fourth and fifth papers show that challenges for cultivation of fuel wood for electricity generation in Thailand involve land-use constraints and costs, respectively. In the fourth paper, the characteristics of farmers who commercially plant eucalyptus and the types of land where eucalyptus is planted are analyzed, based on a field survey carried out in Thailand. The factors that determine the farmers’ decision on whether to plant eucalyptus and the size of area to plant with it are identified, based on the survey using an econometric analysis. The analysis shows that farmers with a small farm do not and are not likely to plant eucalyptus wood. In addition, most eucalyptus growers plant eucalyptus on land used for food crops (mainly cassava area). In the fifth paper, the productivity of eucalyptus wood and the levelized cost of eucalyptus wood delivered to the factory gate in Thailand are estimated to be within the middle range of estimates in other developing countries. The cost of CO 2 abatement by substituting eucalyptus wood for coal and gas in electricity generation in Thailand is estimated to be much higher than the current carbon price...|$|E
40|$|The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is {{the largest}} technology-transfer {{mechanism}} under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The idea of maintaining it or scaling {{it up in the}} post- 2012 period, to accelerate technology transfer, is hence attractive. The weak environmental integrity of the CDM and its propensity to promote predominantly end-of-pipe technologies, however, caution against its perpetuation under a new global climate accord. This paper proposes that, if the CDM were to be maintained, reforms should be adopted to improve the investment conditions for key climate technologies and modify the incentive structure of the CDM. While such reforms contribute to making key technologies more attractive for investors they do not address the CDM’s inability to foster policy reforms. This paper therefore suggests that the CDM is progressively phased out in favour of <b>sectoral</b> carbon <b>crediting</b> <b>mechanisms...</b>|$|R

40|$|Several {{pathways}} {{lead into}} a low-carbon, high-efficiency future. Many go through something commonly called 'sectoral crediting', by which developing economies would both adopt emission reduction goals for entire economic sectors and allow reductions to be sold, via permits, into industrialized countries' compliance carbon markets. These twin elements of <b>sectoral</b> <b>crediting</b> contrast with project-by-project crediting, as is currently seen under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and sector-level emission standards not linked to any market mechanism. Properly designed and operated, <b>sectoral</b> <b>crediting</b> could unleash substantial investment in efficient emissions reductions across entire sectors. A {{quick look at}} the numbers makes the appeal of and need for <b>sectoral</b> <b>crediting</b> clear. The world now emits roughly 45, 000 million CO 2 -equivalent tonnes of greenhouse gases annually. In order to avoid the most dangerous consequences of climate change, that number needs to decrease swiftly, and by at least one-half to two-thirds by mid-century.

These results are consistent with the view that financial intermediation was weakened by the exacerbated nonperforming loan problems {{after the collapse of the}} asset price bubble, and thus prevented credits from shifting to relatively efficient sectors.

40|$|February 1998 The {{severity}} of the financial crises enveloping the ‘tiger’ economies of South East Asia in 1997 {{came as a surprise}} to many observers. This paper uses a simple Fisherian model of the ‘overborrowing syndrome’ to compare the Asian crises of 1997 with earlier overborrowing episodes in Mexico and Chile. While important similarities exist, the crises in South East Asia have been exacerbated by the unhedged foreign exchange positions of Asian banks. These open currency positions not only imposed significant additional losses on the banks following devaluation, they also magnified the scale of overborrowing during the cycle’s initial boom phase. Failure to limit the exposure of banks to foreign exchange risk therefore increased the magnitude of the boom - bust overborrowing cycle both ex ante and ex post. The paper highlights the importance of effective regulation and supervision of capital markets, with a focus on limiting the speculative currency positions of banks, especially those that form the core of the domestic payments system and therefore enjoy a (possibly implicit) public guarantee. Improving the institutional infrastructure of financial supervision is the only effective way of mitigating the macroeconomic costs of overborrowing. JEL Classification: O 16, F 32, F 34, E 44.
