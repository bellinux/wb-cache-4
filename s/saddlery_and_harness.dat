5|$|The {{weaponry}} {{and equipment}} of the Australian Army had mostly been standardised on that {{used by the}} British Army prior to the outbreak of World War I.

These included such items as heliographs, water bottles, bits, stirrups, spurs <b>and</b> shovels, although <b>saddlery</b> <b>and</b> <b>harnesses</b> were provided by a local government manufacturer.
