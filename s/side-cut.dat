40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Side-cutting</b> {{tasks are}} {{commonly}} used in dynamic assessment of ACL injury risk, but only limited information is available concerning the reliability of knee loading parameters. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the reliability of <b>side-cutting</b> data with additional focus on modelling approaches and task execution variables. METHODS: Each subject (n= 8) attended six testing sessions conducted by two observers. Kinematic and kinetic data of 45 ° <b>side-cutting</b> tasks was collected. Inter-trial, inter-session, inter-observer variability and observer/trial ratios were calculated at every time-point of normalised stance, for data derived from two modelling approaches. Variation in task execution variables was regressed against that of temporal profiles of relevant knee data using one-dimensional statistical parametric mapping. RESULTS: Variability in knee kinematics was consistently low across the time-series waveform (≤ 5 °), but knee kinetic variability was high (31. 8, 24. 1 and 16. 9 Nm for sagittal, frontal and transverse planes, respectively) in the weight acceptance phase of the <b>side-cutting</b> task. Calculations conveyed consistently moderate-to-good measurement reliability. Inverse kinematic modelling reduced the variability in sagittal (∼ 6 Nm) and frontal planes (∼ 10 Nm) compared to direct kinematic modelling. Variation in task execution variables did not explain any knee data variability. CONCLUSION: <b>Side-cutting</b> data appears to be reliably measured, however high knee moment variability exhibited in all planes, particularly in the early stance phase, suggests cautious interpretation towards ACL injury mechanics. Such variability may be inherent to the dynamic nature of the <b>side-cutting</b> task or experimental issues not yet known...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} lower limb kinematics and muscular activities during walking, side-turning while walking, and <b>side-cutting</b> movement in athletes with chronic ankle instability and compare the results to those of athletes without chronic ankle instability. Lower limb kinematics and muscular activities were evaluated in 10 athletes with chronic ankle instability and 10 healthy control athletes using a three-dimensional motion analysis system and surface electromyography during the 200 -ms pre-initial contact (IC) and stance phases while walking, side-turning while walking, and <b>side-cutting.</b> During walking or side-turning while walking, there were no significant differences in kinematics or muscle activities between the subjects with and without chronic ankle instability. For the <b>side-cutting</b> task, however, ankle inversion angles during the 200 -ms pre-IC and late stance phases [effect sizes (ESs) = 0. 95 - 1. 43], the hip flexion angle (ESs = 0. 94 - 0. 96) and muscular activities of the gastrocnemius medialis (ESs = 1. 04 - 1. 73) during the early stance phase were significantly greater in the athletes with chronic ankle instability than in the healthy control athletes. Alterations of kinematics in athletes with chronic ankle instability were found not only at the ankle but also at hip joints during the <b>side-cutting</b> movement. These alterations were not detected during walking or side-turning while walking. The findings of the present study indicate that clinicians should take into account the motion of the hip joint during the <b>side-cutting</b> movement in persons with chronic ankle instability.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the variability of lower-limb <b>side-cutting</b> biomechanics in professional rugby league players during a season. Thirteen male professional players were included with a mean age of 22 ± 3. 4 years. The study used a one-way repeated measures experimental design. Subjects were tested at three time points, separated by four weeks, over the last three months of a season. Peak knee valgus and internal rotation moments (Nm/kg- 1), and flexion angle (°), and hip abduction moment (Nm/kg- 1) during the weight-acceptance of the stance phase were collected for all <b>side-cutting</b> maneuvers. A one way repeated-measures ANOVA was performed on the data with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis identifying differences between testing sessions. Mean hip and knee kinematics and kinetics were similar for all measures. There was a significant difference in peak knee flexion angle (°) (Left = F(1, 17) = 4. 895, Right = F(2, 24) = 6. 603) and knee valgus moment (Nm/kg- 1) (Left =F(2, 24) = 9. 535, Right =F(2, 24) = 6. 060) showing significant variability between testing sessions one and three for right knee flexion and knee valgus in both limbs. Bi-lateral knee valgus moments were also significantly different between sessions two and three. Professional rugby league players have shown to be more efficient during the weight-acceptance phase of a <b>side-cutting</b> manoeuver compared to recreational athletes which may be beneficial to reducing frontal plane knee loading and injury risk at the knee.

50|$|During this flange contact, {{the wheel}} {{on the high}} rail is {{experiencing}} the lateral force L, towards {{the outside of the}} curve. As the wheel rotates, the flange tends to climb up the flange angle. It is held down by the vertical load on the wheel V, so that if L/V exceeds the trigonometrical tangent of the flange contact angle, climbing will take place. The wheel flange will climb to the rail head where there is no lateral resistance in rolling movement, and a flange climbing derailment usually takes place. In Diagram 5 the flange contact angle is quite steep, and flange climbing is unlikely. However, if the rail head is side-worn (<b>side-cut)</b> or the flange is worn, as shown in Diagram 6 the contact angle is much flatter and flange climbing is more likely.|$|E
50|$|Eric Pollard {{was happy}} with the {{creation}} of The 130 and it became his implicit pro model. Not until 2007 did Pollard get a ski named after him. The EP Pro is a cornucopia of innovative features. First, they have Early Rise. Early Rise is describing the way the camber of the ski is reversed near the tip and tail. The skis have conventional upturned tips, but they are made higher off the snow by the actual flex of the ski being turned up gradually as it goes from binding to tip. This makes skiing forwards and backwards in deeper snow much easier to control. Another aspect of the EP Pro that helps the skiers control in the powder is the Early Taper. Traditional ski designs make the widest part of the ski at the tip, making it {{the last part of the}} ski to touch the snow before it upturns to the tip. Early Taper brings the fattest part of the ski back toward the boot and away from the tip. This gives more control and quick response from the ski in the deep powder, making turns more creative and free, rather than relying on the harsh curve of the <b>side-cut</b> to whip you into a turn.|$|E

Kinematic and GRF data were collected during a stop-jump task and a <b>side-cutting</b> task for 23 patients. Asymmetry indices between the surgical and non-surgical limbs were calculated for GRF and knee kinetic variables. For the stop-jump task, knee kinetics asymmetry indices were correlated with all GRF asymmetry indices (P[*]<[*] 0. 05), except for loading rate. Vertical GRF impulse asymmetry index predicted peak knee moment, average knee moment, and knee work (R(2) [*]≥[*] 0. 78, P[*]<[*] 0. 01) asymmetry indices. For the <b>side-cutting</b> tasks, knee kinetic asymmetry indices were correlated with the peak propulsion vertical GRF and vertical GRF impulse asymmetry indices (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). Vertical GRF impulse asymmetry index predicted peak knee moment, average knee moment, and knee work (R(2) [*]≥[*] 0. 55, P[*]<[*] 0. 01) asymmetry indices.

40|$|PurposeAnterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) injuries commonly occur {{during the early}} phase of landing and cutting tasks that involve sudden decelerations. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of jump height and jump speed on lower extremity biomechanics during a stop-jump task and the effect of cutting speed on lower extremity biomechanics during a <b>side-cutting</b> task. MethodsThirty-six recreational athletes performed a stop-jump task under 3 conditions: jumping fast, jumping for maximum height, and jumping for 60 % of maximum height. Participants also performed a <b>side-cutting</b> task under 2 conditions: cutting at maximum speed and cutting at 60 % of maximum speed. Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data were collected. ResultsThe jumping fast condition resulted in increased peak posterior ground reaction force (PPGRF), knee extension moment at PPGRF, and knee joint stiffness and decreased knee flexion angle compared with the jumping for maximum height condition. The jumping for 60 % of maximum height condition resulted in decreased knee flexion angle compared with the jumping for maximum height condition. Participants demonstrated greater PPGRF, knee extension moment at PPGRF, knee valgus angle and varus moment at PPGRF, knee joint stiffness, and knee flexion angle during the cutting at maximum speed condition compared with the cutting at 60 % maximum speed condition. ConclusionPerforming jump landing at an increased jump speed resulted in lower extremity movement patterns that have been previously associated with an increase in ACL loading. Cutting speed also affected lower extremity biomechanics. Jump speed and cutting speed need to be considered when designing ACL injury risk screening and injury prevention programs...|$|R

40|$|Context : Stress {{fractures}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} common injuries in sports, accounting for approximately 10 % of all overuse injuries. Treatment of fifth metatarsal stress fractures involves both surgical and nonsurgical interventions. Fifth metatarsal stress fractures are difficult to treat because of the risks of delayed union, nonunion, and recurrent injuries. Most of these injuries occur during agility tasks, such as those performed in soccer, basketball, and lacrosse. Objective : To examine the effect of a rigid carbon graphite footplate on plantar loading during 2 agility tasks. Design :  Crossover study. Setting : Laboratory. Patients or Other Participants : A total of 19 recreational male athletes with no history of lower extremity injury in the past 6 months and no previous metatarsal stress fractures were tested. Main Outcome Measure(s) :  Seven 45 ° <b>side-cut</b> and crossover-cut tasks were completed in a shoe with or without a full-length rigid carbon plate. Testing order between the shoe conditions and the 2 cutting tasks was randomized. Plantar-loading data were recorded using instrumented insoles. Peak pressure, maximum force, force-time integral, and contact area beneath the total foot, the medial and lateral midfoot, and the medial, middle, and lateral forefoot were analyzed. A series of paired t tests was used to examine differences between the footwear conditions (carbon graphite footplate, shod) for both cutting tasks independently (α =. 05). Results : During the <b>side-cut</b> task, the footplate increased total foot and lateral midfoot peak pressures while decreasing contact area and lateral midfoot force-time integral. During the crossover-cut task, the footplate increased total foot and lateral midfoot peak pressure and lateral forefoot force-time integral while decreasing total and lateral forefoot contact area. Conclusions : Although a rigid carbon graphite footplate altered some aspects of the plantar- pressure profile during cutting in uninjured participants, it was ineffective in reducing plantar loading beneath the fifth metatarsal...|$|E

Methods We describe transjugular renal biopsy with the Quickcore™ system in 9 patients with nephrotic syndrome and contraindications to percutaneous renal biopsy, who underwent biopsy between 23 October 1996 and 12 April 2001. The most common contraindication was oral anticoagulation with coumadin (40 %). Other contraindications included horseshoe kidney, severe renal failure, and spontaneous coagulopathy. A 62 cm straight catheter and 60 cm <b>side-cut</b> Quickcore™ biopsy needle were used to obtain cortical tissue. Packing of the biopsy tract with Gelfoam™ was used for venographically identified capsular perforation. Results Ten procedures were performed on 9 patients with one requiring re-biopsy (5 % of all renal biopsies performed at our institution). There were 9 transjugular renal biopsy and one combined liver-kidney biopsy. A mean of 4 ± 2 passes were made, {{with a mean of}} 3 ± 1 cores obtained per procedure. Histologic diagnosis was made in 90 % of biopsies and in 100 % of patients. Two patients developed transient hydronephrosis associated with gross hematuria; both required transfusion.

Experimental procedures were first studied and best practices were established including: acoustic emission based methods for tool-workpiece contact detection, laser-tool alignment strategies, assist gas chip removal, and appropriate ranges of machining parameters. ^ Finite volume based modeling of the 3 -D laser heating process was performed {{in order to determine}} the effect of laser operating parameters on the material removal temperature, peak temperature, and variation in temperature across the material removal area. A novel thermal paint based method was used to determine the absorptivity of each surface and validate the thermal model. A 2 -D finite element model of the chip formation process was developed. Material plasticity was considered using Johnson-Cook constitutive models. The FE model incorporated an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian adaptive mesh scheme, heat generated by plastic deformation, and the edge radius of the cutting tool. Variations in material removal temperatures, cutting speed, uncut chip thickness, and cutting edge radius were analyzed on the bases of peak tool temperatures and cutting forces. ^ Slotting and <b>side-cutting</b> LAMM experiments were performed based on the results of the numerical models. LAMM results were compared to conventional (no-laser) on the bases of: surface roughness, edge burrs, tool wear, tool life, acoustic emissions, and the microstructure of remaining work material. Significant improvements in all quantitative and qualitative measures were found with LAMM. Neither degradation nor significant change in the remaining workpiece microstructure was observed during multi-pass LAMM at material removal temperatures up to 450 °C. Process improvements with LAMM were heavily dependent on the work material, machining configuration, and operating parameters. LAMM was found to be beneficial for all of the materials in the study during one or more machining configurations. ...|$|R

Neuromuscular assessments of knee control are thought to {{play a critical role}} in the prevention of ACL-injuries, but few studies have investigated tasks other than vertical drop jump and <b>side-cut</b> manoeuvres. A new task aiming to replicate side-step movements seen in ACL-injury situations in football matches was developed. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of a task developed for assessing knee control in female footballers. It was examined if electromyography (EMG) could successfully be recorded during the new task, and whether EMG pre-activation would undergo clinically relevant changes as a function of ball release frequency and visual stimulus. A repeated measures experimental study was designed, with 16 female footballers with no history of ACLinjury as participants. EMG pre-activation (50 ms prior to initial contact) for the semitendinosus (ST), vastus lateralis (VL), gluteus medius (GMED), and gluteus maximus (GMAX) was recorded during a task with multiple change-of-directions that mimicked situations in football matches where a defender is pressing an attacker. Participants reacted to a table tennis ball being launched, with a cutting motion to stop the ball with their feet. Comparisons between conditions with visual stimulus (VS) and without visual stimulus (NOVS) were made in the unanticipated task. EMG pre-activation could not be captured successfully for all the GMED or GMAX during the task. EMG-data from the VL could be obtained from 397 cuts (36. 1 %).

To overcome dormancy using 100 seeds per treatment divided into four replicates, employed the following techniques: seeds without scarification; scarified on the opposite side of the hilum and two <b>side-cut</b> 25 % and 50 % opposite the hilum, all of which are made with and without soaking in distilled water for 24 hours. It was evaluated the first count, emergency, emergency speed index, length and mass of dry matter of shoot and root. The biometric data were analyzed by frequency classes and the pre-germination treatments by analysis of variance and Tukey’s test. The fruits have an average of 34. 77 cm in length, width 39. 96 mm, 174. 32 g of fresh weight and 23. 63 seeds, which have an average of 15. 83 mm, 11. 34 mm, 6, 0. 867 g and 39 mm in length, width and fresh weight, respectively. Scarification increased germination and negatively affects the dry matter accumulation in shoots. The soaking did not affect germination, but increases the initial growth of the seedling shoot. The cut in the seed of 50 % in the area opposite the hilum affect the emergence and seedling growth of Cassia grandis. A espécie Cassia grandis L. f. (Fabaceae), apresenta importância ambiental e econômica que justificam estudos para o seu melhor aproveitamento. O objetivo deste trabalho é avaliar a morfometria de frutos e sementes de Cassia grandis L. f. e o efeito da aplicação de tratamentos pré-germinativos. A biometria dos frutos foi determinada numa amostra de 100 unidades, retiradas aleatoriamente do lote coletado no Centro de Ciências Agrárias da Universidade Federal da Paraíba, constituindo-se nas determinações de comprimento, largura, massa fresca e número de sementes por fruto. Destas sementes, numa amostra de 100 unidades retiradas aleatoriamente, determinaram-se comprimento, largura, diâmetro e massa fresca dos referidos propágulos. Para superação de dormência utilizaram-se 100 sementes por tratamento divididas em quatro repetições, sendo empregadas as seguintes técnicas: sementes sem escarificação, escarificadas no lado oposto e das duas laterais ao hilo e com corte de 25 % e 50 % no lado oposto ao hilo, sendo todos estes efetuados sem e com embebição em água destilada por 24 horas. Avaliaram-se primeira contagem, emergência, índice de velocidade de emergência, comprimentos e massas da matéria seca da parte área e da raiz. Os dados biométricos foram analisados em classes de frequências e dos tratamentos pré-germinativos através da análise de variância e do teste de Tukey. Os frutos apresentam em média 34, 77 cm de comprimento, 39, 96 mm de largura, 174, 32 g de massa fresca e 23, 63 sementes, que têm, em média, 15, 83 mm, 11, 34 mm, 6, 39 mm e 0, 867 g de comprimento, largura, diâmetro e massa fresca, respectivamente. A escarificação aumenta a germinação e afeta negativamente o acúmulo de matéria seca na parte aérea. A embebição não afeta a germinação, mas aumenta o crescimento inicial da parte aérea das plântulas. O corte na semente de 50 % na região oposta ao hilo prejudica a emergência e o crescimento das plântulas de Cassia fistula...|$|E
50|$|Lineman's, {{linesman}}'s (US English), linesman pliers (Canadian English), combination pliers, or <b>side-cutting</b> pliers are {{a type of}} pliers used by electricians {{and other}} tradesmen primarily for gripping, twisting, bending and cutting wire and cable. Linemen's pliers owe their effectiveness to their plier design, which multiplies force through leverage. Lineman's pliers have a gripping joint at their snub nose and cutting edge in their craw. Some versions include either an additional gripping or crimping device at {{the crux of the}} handle side of the pliers' joint. Lineman's pliers typically are machined from forged steel and the two handles precisely joined with a heavy-duty rivet that maintains the pliers' accuracy even after repeated use under extreme force on heavy-gauge wire. Lineman's pliers usually have grips for better handling than bare metal handles; the grips may also provide insulation for protection against electric shock when working with live circuits, although most models are marked as not listed for such use. Some pliers are certified to withstand a specified voltage, e.g. 1000V.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether treadmill versus overground soccer match simulations have similar effects on knee joint mechanics during side cutting. Nineteen male recreational soccer players completed a 45 -min treadmill and overground match simulation. Heart rate (HR) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded every 5  min. Prior to exercise (time 0  min), at "half-time" (time 45  min) and 15  min post-exercise (time 60  min), participants performed five trials of 45 ° <b>side-cutting</b> manoeuvres. Knee abduction moments and knee extension angles were analysed using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (α =  0. 05). Physiological responses were significantly greater during the overground (HR 160  ±  7 beats ∙ min(- 1); RPE 15  ±  2) than the treadmill simulation (HR 142  ±  5 beats ∙ min(- 1); RPE 12  ±  2). Knee extension angles significantly increased over time and were more extended at time 60  min compared with time 0  min and time 45  min. No significant differences in knee abduction moments were observed. Although knee abduction moments were not altered over time during both simulations, passive rest during half-time induced changes in knee angles that may have implications for anterior cruciate ligament injury risk...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedFemale athletes tear their ACL {{approximately}} 6 {{times more}} often than their male counterparts. Most laboratory studies evaluating gender specific biomechanical risk factors for ACL tears have done so under anticipated conditions. Whether females and males behave similarly under anticipated and unanticipated conditions is not known. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate gender differences in frontal plane knee kinematics and kinetics during both anticipated and unanticipated <b>side-cutting</b> tasks in post-pubertal soccer players. Thirty-six healthy soccer players between the ages 14 and 18 (17 male, 19 female) participated. Lower extremity kinematics (8 - camera Vicon System; 120 Hz) and kinetics (AMTI force plate; 2400 Hz) were quantified as subjects performed a side-step cutting maneuver under anticipated and unanticipated conditions. Gender differences in peak knee valgus moment and peak knee valgus angle were evaluated using two-way ANOVA and t-tests. During anticipated conditions, females exhibited higher knee valgus moments and angles than males. During unanticipated conditions however, males exhibited higher knee valgus moments and angles than females. These results suggest that assessing at-risk behavior for ACL injury is dependent on the testing methodology. Future studies evaluating gender differences in lower extremity mechanics should incorporate both anticipated and unanticipated conditions to assess fully at-risk behavior...|$|R
40|$|Background Hamstring {{strain and}} {{anterior}} cruciate ligament injuries are, respectively, the most prevalent and serious non-contact occurring injuries in team sports. Specific biomechanical and neuromuscular variables {{have been used to}} estimate the risk of incurring a non-contact injury in athletes. Objective The aim {{of this study was to}} systematically review the evidences for the effectiveness of injury prevention protocols to modify biomechanical and neuromuscular anterior cruciate and/or hamstring injuries associated risk factors in uninjured team sport athletes. Data Sources PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Cochrane Libraries, U. S. National Institutes of Health clinicaltrials. gov, Sport Discuss and Google Scholar databases were searched for relevant journal articles published until March 2015. A manual review of relevant articles, authors, and journals, including bibliographies was performed from identified articles. Main Results Nineteen studies were included in this review. Four assessment categories: i) landing, ii) side cutting, iii) stop-jump, and iv) muscle strength outcomes, were used to analyze the effectiveness of the preventive protocols. Eight studies using multifaceted interventions supported by video and/or technical feedback showed improvement in landing and/or stop-jump biomechanics, while no effects were observed on <b>side-cutting</b> maneuver. Additionally, multifaceted programs including hamstring eccentric exercises increased hamstring strength, hamstring to quadriceps functional ratio and/or promoted a shift of optimal knee flexion peak torque toward a more open angle position. Conclusions Multifaceted programs, supported by proper video and/or technical feedback, including eccentric hamstring exercises would positively modify the biomechanical and or neuromuscular anterior cruciate and/or hamstring injury risk factors...|$|R
