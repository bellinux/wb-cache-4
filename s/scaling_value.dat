40|$|Abstract:- The JPEG 2000 {{standard}} defines {{two methods}} for {{region of interest}} (ROI) coding, the maximum shift and the general scaling. In the maximum shift method, an ROI can have any shape that {{does not need to}} be transmitted to the decoder, but does not have the flexibility to select an arbitrary <b>scaling</b> <b>value</b> to compromise the ROI quality compared with the background. The general scaling based method supports any <b>scaling</b> <b>value</b> providing the user/application with the ability to control ROI and background qualities, but it limits the choice of the ROI shape and needs ROI shape coding. In this paper, we propose a novel ROI coding method named Bitplane Overlap Shift (BOShift). The proposed BOShift is compatible with the JPEG 2000 standard and it supports both arbitrary scaling values and arbitrary ROI shapes, without shape coding. Moreover, it encodes images with distinguished performance at low bit rates...|$|E

40|$|One {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the new JPEG 2000 image coding standard is support of region of interest (ROI) coding using the maximum shift (Maxshift) method, which allows for arbitrarily shaped ROI image compression without shape coding or explicitly transmitting any shape information to the decoder.
