40|$|Abstract Background Short {{tandem repeat}} polymorphisms (STRPs) are {{powerful}} tools for gene mapping and other applications. A STRP genome scan of 10 cM is usually adequate for mapping single gene disorders. However mapping studies involving genetically complex disorders and especially association (linkage disequilibrium) often require higher STRP density. Results We report {{the development of}} two separate 10 cM human STRP <b>Screening</b> <b>Sets</b> (Sets 12 and 52) which span all chromosomes. When combined, the two Sets contain a total of 782 STRPs, with average STRP spacing of 4. 8 cM, average heterozygosity of 0. 72, and total sex-average coverage of 3535 cM. The current Sets are comprised almost entirely of STRPs based on tri- and tetranucleotide repeats. We also report correction of primer sequences for many STRPs used in previous <b>Screening</b> <b>Sets.</b> Detailed information for the new <b>Screening</b> <b>Sets</b> is available from our web site: [URL]. Conclusion Our new human STRP <b>Screening</b> <b>Sets</b> will improve the quality and cost effectiveness of genotyping for gene mapping and other applications. </p...|$|R

30|$|The several {{reported}} cases of reduced borehole yields after construction might be caused by improper <b>screen</b> <b>setting</b> depths and displaced gravel packing combined with inadequate quality of the gravel pack material, which leads to partial blocking of productive water sections. This sort of problems could be diminished by strengthening the supervision of drilling activities in the field as indicated by this study. Disputes that often arise between drillers and clients in terms of depths drilled and screen settings could be reduced significantly if geophysical borehole logging is conducted prior to borehole completion and design of screen settings. However, the actual completed construction needs afterwards {{to be controlled by}} resistivity logging, but not necessarily using sophisticated and expensive equipment. <b>Screen</b> <b>setting</b> control can be done by the drilling supervisor by applying a resistivity meter and simple cable tool with conventional electrode probe.

40|$|This paper aims at {{analysing}} {{the presence}} of gypsy characters in two neo-Victorian popular films, namely Joe Johnston’s The Wolfman (2010) and Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows (2011). The cultural construction of nineteenth-century gypsies, those “Others within Europe” (Boyarin 433) whose presence in Victorian fiction was peripheral, spectral and at times invisible (Nord 3 - 4), is simultaneously exploited and contested by these two neo-Victorian screen narratives to raise issues of otherness and invisibility on the <b>screen.</b> <b>Setting</b> off from the premise that screen texts, just like print texts, can also be participant in the neo-Victorian project of reimagining the underside of Victorian culture for contemporary audiences (Whelehan 273), this paper traces how the adaptation of Victorian gypsies for the screen, true to the palimpsestuous potential inherent {{to the process of}} adaptation (Hutcheon 6) and sharing the double drive between past and present which characterises the neo-Victorian genre (Arias and Pulham xiii; Shiller 539), hybridises our cultural memory of the Victorian Age on the screen while concurrently raises concerns over the persistent liminal status of gypsies in contemporary European culture. In particular, this paper illustrates how the tropes prototypically associated to gypsies (namely their nomadic lifestyle, mysticism, alienated existence or their perceived association to criminality) which {{can be traced back to}} Victorian culture are deployed on the neo-Victorian popular screen (with varyingly succesful outcomes) to comment on their (in) visibility in the European popular imagination.

40|$|Energy storage {{techniques}} are receiving a growing interest because renewable energy {{is not always}} available when needed. One of these energy storage technologies is Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES). In an ATES system the thermal energy available at the surface is seasonally stored in an aquifer through injection and extraction of groundwater. During summer, cool groundwater is extracted from the cold well(s) for cooling purposes. Through this process the water is heated after which it is injected in the warm well(s). During winter this system is reversed and the stored warm water is extracted for heating purposes. The cooled water is then re-injected into the cold well(s). In this way, warm and cold zones arise around the ATES wells in the subsurface and a seasonal storage of thermal energy is created. The increasing number of ATES systems leads to concerns by drinking water companies and environmental regulators about the long term impacts of ATES systems on groundwater quality. Additionally, {{only a small part}} of the subsurface in Flanders meets the optimal conditions for ATES, i. e. the presence of a thick, reasonable homogeneous aquifer. Therefore, the question is posed whether ATES is also feasible in less favorable conditions such as aquifers with varying redox conditions or aquifers characterized by sedimentary heterogeneity. The possibility to install ATES systems in such suboptimal conditions would largely increase the applicability of ATES in Flanders. In the first part of the study, the influence of ATES on groundwater chemistry is assessed by means of a literature review and a comparison of groundwater quality monitoring data at seven ATES systems with ambient groundwater quality values from 69 monitoring wells in Flanders. The seven evaluated Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) systems are positioned in key aquifers, which contain major groundwater resources for the region. The results of the analysis of the hydrochemical data confirm that the small temperature differences (&# 916;T&# 8804; 10) at which the ATES systems operate do not influence the concentrations of the main chemical constituents. Mixing of shallow with deeper groundwater during ATES operation, on the other hand, can alter groundwater quality. So, an integrated design of ATES systems taking into account the groundwater chemistry is very important, especially in phreatic aquifers and in the vicinity of public drinking water supply well fields. Well clogging due to iron (hydr) oxide precipitation is a widespread problem in aquifers with varying redox conditions from which the performance of ATES wells may also suffer. The interactions between physical and chemical processes during ATES operation are, however, not well understood. In the second part of the study, the reactive transport modeling code PHT 3 D is used to assess the effects of alternating pumping by ATES systems near the redox boundary on the precipitation of iron hydroxides for two cases in Flanders. Results show that in both investigated cases, initial mixing plays an important role in the development of Fe(OH) 3 precipitation around the wells. The models further predict that even small temperature differences have a significant effect on the Fe(OH) 3 concentration. Avoiding the mixing of oxygen/nitrate rich water with iron rich water remains the best strategy to prevent well clogging. Recent model studies indicate that meter-scale heterogeneities in the hydraulic conductivity field introduce considerable uncertainty in the distribution of thermal energy around an ATES system and can lead to a reduction in the thermal recoverability. In the third part of the study, the influence of centimeter-scale clay drapes on the efficiency of a doublet ATES system and the distribution of the thermal energy around the ATES wells is quantified. Multiple-point geostatistical simulation of edge properties is used to incorporate the clay drapes in the models. The results show that clay drapes have an influence both on the distribution of thermal energy in the subsurface and on the efficiency of an ATES system. The distribution of the thermal energy is determined by the strike of the clay drapes, with the major axis of anisotropy parallel to the clay drape strike. The clay drapes have a negative impact on ATES efficiency in the models without a hydraulic gradient. In the models with a hydraulic gradient, however, the presence of clay drapes has a positive influence on the efficiency of the ATES system. It is recommended to incorporate small scale heterogeneities in heat transport models to get a better estimate on ATES efficiency and distribution of thermal energy. To conclude, the results of this thesis show that the groundwater quality changes induced by ATES are rather small. However, phreatic aquifers are more vulnerable and especially near drinking water production sites, an integrated ATES design, taking the groundwater chemistry into account, is indispensable. Each feasibility study for ATES in aquifers with varying redox conditions should incorporate an analysis of the hydrochemistry at several depths. In this way, the well <b>screen</b> <b>setting</b> can be optimized and the risk of well clogging due to iron (hydr) oxide precipitation is reduced. A good insight in the heterogeneity of an aquifer is indispensable for a proper positioning of ATES wells, as even small scale sedimentary features can have a large impact on the distribution of thermal energy and on the efficiency of an ATES system.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesSearch for {{biomarkers}} {{for early}} detection of cancer is a very active area of research, but most studies are done in clinical rather than screening settings. We aimed to empirically evaluate the role of study setting for early detection marker identification and validation. Study Design and SettingA panel of 92 candidate cancer protein markers was measured in 35 clinically identified colorectal cancer patients and 35 colorectal cancer patients identified at screening colonoscopy. For each case group, we selected 38 controls without colorectal neoplasms at screening colonoscopy. Single-, two- and three-marker combinations discriminating cases and controls were identified in each setting and subsequently validated in the alternative setting. ResultsIn all scenarios, a higher number of predictive biomarkers were initially detected in the clinical setting, but a substantially lower proportion of identified biomarkers could subsequently be confirmed in the <b>screening</b> <b>setting.</b> Confirmation rates were 50. 0 %, 84. 5 %, and 74. 2 % for one-, two-, and three-marker algorithms identified in the <b>screening</b> <b>setting</b> and were 42. 9 %, 18. 6 %, and 25. 7 % for algorithms identified in the clinical setting.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in technologies for high-throughout single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) - based genotyping have improved efficiency and cost {{so that it}} is now becoming reasonable to consider the use of SNPs for genomewide linkage analysis. However, a suitable <b>screening</b> <b>set</b> of SNPs and a corresponding linkage map have yet to be described. The SNP maps described here fill this void and provide a resource for fast genome scanning for disease genes. We have evaluated 6, 297 SNPs in a diversity panel composed of European Americans, African Americans, and Asians. The markers were assessed for assay robustness, suitable allele frequencies, and informativeness of multi-SNP clusters. Individuals from 56 Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain pedigrees, with 1770 potentially informative meioses altogether, were genotyped with a subset of 2, 988 SNPs, for map construction. Extensive genotyping-error analysis was performed, and the resulting SNP linkage map has an average map resolution of 3. 9 cM, with map positions containing either a single SNP or several tightly linked SNPs. The order of markers on this map compares favorably with several other linkage and physical maps. We compared map distances between the SNP linkage map and the interpolated SNP linkage map constructed by the deCode Genetics group. We also evaluated cM/Mb distance ratios in females and males, along each chromosome, showing broadly defined regions of increased and decreased rates of recombination.
