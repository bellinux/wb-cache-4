30|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} probability distributions, {{known as the}} folded distributions, arises in many practical problems when only the magnitudes of deviations are recorded, and {{the signs of the}} deviations are ignored. The folded <b>Student’s</b> t <b>distribution</b> is one such probability distribution which belongs to this class. It is related to the <b>Student’s</b> t <b>distribution</b> in the sense that if Y is a distributed random variable having <b>Student’s</b> t <b>distribution,</b> then the random variable X = |Y| is said to have a folded <b>Student’s</b> t <b>distribution.</b> The distribution is called folded because the probability mass (that is, area) {{to the left of the}} point x[*]=[*] 0 is folded over by taking the absolute value. As pointed out above, such a case may be encountered if only the magnitude of some random variable is recorded, without taking into consideration its sign (that is, its direction). Further, this distribution is used when the measurement system produces only positive measurements, from a normally distributed process. The folded <b>Student’s</b> t <b>distribution</b> was developed by Psarakis and Panaretoes (1990). For details on the folded <b>Student’s</b> t <b>distribution,</b> see Johnson et al. (1994). For some bivariate extension of the folded <b>Student’s</b> t <b>distribution,</b> the interested readers are referred to Psarakis and Panaretos (2001). Recently, many researchers have studied the statistical methods dealing with the properties and applications of the folded <b>Student’s</b> t <b>distribution,</b> among them Brazauskas and Kleefeld (2011, 2014), and Scollnik (2014), are notable.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we are {{concerned}} with a branch of evolutionary algorithms termed estimation of distribution (EDA), which has been successfully used to tackle derivative-free global optimization problems. For existent EDA algorithms, {{it is a common}} practice to use a Gaussian distribution or a mixture of Gaussian components to represent the statistical property of available promising solutions found so far. Observing that the <b>Student's</b> t <b>distribution</b> has heavier and longer tails than the Gaussian, which may be beneficial for exploring the solution space, we propose a novel EDA algorithm termed ESTDA, in which the <b>Student's</b> t <b>distribution,</b> rather than Gaussian, is employed. To address hard multimodal and deceptive problems, we extend ESTDA further by substituting a single <b>Student's</b> t <b>distribution</b> with a mixture of <b>Student's</b> t <b>distributions.</b> The resulting algorithm is named as estimation of mixture of <b>Student's</b> t <b>distribution</b> algorithm (EMSTDA). Both ESTDA and EMSTDA are evaluated through extensive and in-depth numerical experiments using over a dozen of benchmark objective functions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms provide remarkably better performance than their Gaussian counterparts. Comment: 15 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007 - 2009 has questioned {{the provisions of}} Basel II agreement on capital adequacy requirements and the appropriateness of VaR measurement. This paper reconsiders the use of Value-at-risk as a measure for potential risk of economic losses in financial markets by estimating VaR for daily stock returns with the application of various parametric univariate models that belong to the class of ARCH models {{which are based on}} the skewed <b>Student</b> <b>distribution.</b> We used daily data for three groups of stock market indices, namely Developed, Southeast Asia and Latin America. The data covered the period 1987 - 2009. We conducted our analysis with the adoption of the methodology suggested by Giot and Laurent (2003). Therefore, we estimated an APARCH model based on the skewed <b>Student</b> <b>distribution</b> to fully take into account the fat left and right tails of the returns distribution. The main finding of our analysis is that the skewed Student APARCH improves considerably the forecasts of one-day-ahead VaR for long and short trading positions. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of each model with the calculation of Kupiec's (1995) Likelihood Ratio test on the empirical failure test. Moreover, for the case of the skewed Student APARCH model we computed the expected shortfall and the average multiple of tail event to risk measure. These two measures helped us to further assess the information we obtained from the estimation of the empirical failure rates.

40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{this paper}} is to address the issue of {{nonlinear}} regression with outliers, possibly in high dimension, without specifying the form of the link function and under a parametric approach. Nonlinearity is handled via an underlying mixture of affine regressions. Each regression is encoded in a joint multivariate <b>Student</b> <b>distribution</b> on the responses and covariates. This joint modeling allows the use of an inverse regression strategy to handle the high dimensionality of the data, while the heavy tail of the <b>Student</b> <b>distribution</b> limits the contamination by outlying data. The possibility to add a number of latent variables similar to factors to the model further reduces its sensitivity to noise or model misspecification. The mixture model setting has the advantage of providing a natural inference procedure using an EM algorithm. The tractability and flexibility of the algorithm are illustrated in simulations and real high-dimensional data with good performance that compares favorably with other existing methods...|$|E
