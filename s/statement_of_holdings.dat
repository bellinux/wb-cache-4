In fact, Hospital Corporation of America {{is responsible for}} between four to five percent of all inpatient care delivered in the United States today. In partial fulfillment of {{the requirements of the}} Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College at the University of Mississippi, I have researched the healthcare industry, analyzed the company’s financial statements, and provided audit and tax recommendations to the company’s management.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the possibilities {{and ways of}} determining the impact of classical Latin literature in the Middle Ages, taking as an example the four centuries from the ninth to the twelfth and using the four most relevant parameters: the literary influence, the explicit <b>statements,</b> the <b>holdings</b> <b>of</b> libraries, {{and the production of}} manuscripts. As for the influence, imitation {{is by far the most}} significant criterion, whereas quotations may often be second hand, and reminiscences fortuitous. Library catalogues, though rather rare for our period, can give useful information on the characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>holdings</b> at different periods of time. It is impossible to know if the books mentioned were actually read, but if the additions to the lists <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> are correctly dated, the added information show which new texts were considered indispensable at a given moment. Finally, if certain precautions are taken in interpreting the numbers, the extant manuscripts and fragments allow us partly to identify the most widely diffused texts for the whole period, partly to follow the evolution of the grammar curriculum and to determine for each of the four centuries the popularity of the works that were not read in the schools. A comparison between the data from the catalogues and those from the manuscripts shows many disparities, especially for most of the Ovidian poems and for short texts, which easily disappear when they are not bound with other works. As a result, it is after all the surviving manuscripts that appear to constitute the most reliable approach for measuring the popularity of a given text...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} there is a relationship between land distribution and productivity in agriculture. This paper estimates a cross-country agricultural production function that includes for the first time measures of land distribution as elements of productivity. The measures capture both the size distribution <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> within a country, and the availability <b>of</b> <b>holdings</b> across the agricultural population. The estimates suggest a very large and significant role for the size distribution <b>of</b> <b>holdings.</b> This role, though, does not appear to arise because of the decreasing returns to farm size that are often identified in micro-level research. The results indicate that improvements in the distribution of agricultural land are a potential source of gains in agricultural productivity, and income per capita, across countries...|$|R
