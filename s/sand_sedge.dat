A similar pattern is seen with mosses and lichens, with the various areas of the dunes containing different species according to the acidity of the sand. At least four moss species have been identified as important in dune stabilization, since they help to consolidate the sand, add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species.

40|$|A few {{high-quality}} prairies {{still exist}} in the sand deposits of the Green River Lowlands. The most extensive remnants are in the Green River State Wildlife Area, Lee County, Illinois. Three upland prairie communities were surveyed; a dry sand prairie dominated by Schizachyrium scoparium, Ambrosia psilostachya, and Amorpha canescens; a dry-mesic sand prairie dominated by Sorghastrum nutans, Schizachyrium scoparium, Antennaria plantaginifolia, and Liatris aspera; and a mesic sand prairie where Sorghastrum nutans and Andropogon gerardii were the dominant grasses, and Parthenium integrifolium, Fragaria virginiana, Liatris pycnostachya, and Euthamia gymnospermoides the common forbs. The lowlands, which included approximately 325 ha, were dominated by the exotic Phalaris arundinacea, but high-quality wet <b>sand</b> prairie, <b>sedge</b> meadow, and marsh communities existed. The wet sand prairies were dominated by Spartina pectinata, Helianthus grosseserratus, and Solidago canadensis; the sedge meadows were dominated by Carex haydenii, Calamagrostis canadensis, and Persicaria coccinea; the marsh communities were divided into distinct vegetation zones.

40|$|Restoration of {{degraded}} riparian plant communities {{must consider}} relationships among water table dynamics, soil texture, and plant species. Water table dynamics, soil texture, and slope were compared among riparian plant communities dominated by: (1) beaked sedge (Carex rostrata), (2) Geyer's willow (Salix geyeriana [S. geyerana]), and (3) black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa [Populus balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa]) occurring on recent alluvial bars. Six sites in western Montana (USA) were examined for each plant community type. Mean bimonthly fluctuation in water table depth {{did not differ}} among the 3 plant communities (P= 0. 67), but mean depth to water table was greatest (P= 0. 004) in the cottonwood community (62. 8 cm), intermediate for the willow (32. 0 cm) and least for sedge communities (20. 7 cm). Soil texture differed among the 3 plant communities for sand (P= 0. 0004), silt (P= 0. 0002), and clay (P= 0. 003). Cottonwood communities occurred on soils that averaged 78 % <b>sand,</b> whereas <b>sedge</b> and willow sites averaged 47 % sand and 35 % sand, respectively. Silt content was 40 % beneath willow, 35 % beneath sedge and 15 % beneath cottonwood communities. Soils of the willow sites averaged 25 % clay compared with 18 % and 7 % for sedge and cottonwood communities, respectively. Soils beneath all 3 plant communities differed in coarse fragment percentage (P= 0. 01), averaging 46 % in cottonwood, 22 % in willow, and 15 % in sedge sites. No {{differences were found in}} slope among the 3 plant communities, either parallel to the stream (P= 0. 76) or perpendicular to the stream (P= 0. 29).

40|$|Parabolic dunes are {{a feature}} of the Manawatu, New Zealand coastline. Moving inland, the dunes form {{temporary}} wetlands in deflation hollows (dune slacks) on their seaward side. One of the few remaining natural dune systems lift in the Manawatu is located south of the Rangitikei River mouth at Tangimoana, the "Tangimoana dump dunes", a proposed DoC reserve. The area contains excellent examples of temporary wetlands in dune slacks, with early successional vegetation well represented. This vegetation is being eliminated by larger wetland plants and is unable to colonize new habitat, as dune stabilization prevents its formation. The vegetation of the proposed reserve was sampled and vegetation patterns were related to environmental factors. Foredune, dune plain, slack, marram dune, shrub dune and grassland communities were identitied. A low species diversity was found, which included a high proportion of exotic species in the grassland, shrub and marram dune communities. The low number of communities and species richness {{may be related to the}} area's youth and the dune's dynamic nature. Water table fluctuation were monitored in two temporary wetlands, which contained the endangered <b>sand</b> spiked <b>sedge,</b> Eleocharis neozelandica, an early successional species. The water table fluctuation were directly related to rainfall and season. A high winter and spring water table in 1995 resulted in dramatic changes in the distributions of some dune slack plants. Control and exclosure plots were used to assess the effects of rabbit browse on the dune slack vegetation. These plots also provided valuable information of the vegetation change to water table heights. Species more suited to permanently wet location increased greatly, while species suited to more temporary wet areas moved higher in elevation, to around the winter high water line. Two endangered plants of the Manawatu dunelands, Eleocharis neozelandica and Pimelea "Turakina" were cultivated and then established at the Tangimoana dump dunes. Pimelea "Turakina" appears to be well adapted to the Manawatu dune lands and produced abundant seedlings at Tangimoana. Creation of deflation hollows for E. neozelandica habitat was undertaken. E. neozelandica was planted in the constructed hollows at three separate elevation, and survived winter submergence at the medium and high elevation sites, of at least seven months at the medium site, and appears to be a valuable and effective management tool for the conservation of dune slack species. The tolerance and growth of E. neozelandica and other dune slack species in relation to sand burial, waterlogging and submergence was studies in controlled experiments. They appear to be generally intolerant of sand burial, but all survived submergence and thrived in waterlogged conditions. Temporary wetlands in dune slacks at the Tangimoana are incredible dynamic in relation to the water table fluctuation, and changes in species distributions resulting from them. Management solutions need to be active and address these results in order to maintain the indigenous flora of the area...|$|R

5000|$|The geology of Annet is of Hercynian granite overlain with {{raised beach}} deposits. On the {{southern}} end there is a [...] "thick bed of soil, part sand and part soil". The island is low-lying with a top height of 18 m and the coast consists of boulder storm beaches. The effects of wind exposure, salt spray and lack of topography, restricts diversity and only 53 species of vascular plants have been recorded. The north of the island is dominated by a well developed, thick, thrift (Armeria maritima) turf whilst the southern part is dominated by dense stands of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), bramble (Rubus fruticosus) and bluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), with some <b>sand</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex arenaria) and Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus). Thickets of tree mallow (Lavatera arborea) have developed {{at the back of}} some of the boulder beaches. There were scattered colonies of shore dock (Rumex rupestris) until a storm in 1982 swept away some of the boulder beaches. One colony remains in the corner of a relatively sheltered beach in the south of the island at a freshwater seepage. Shore dock is one of the primary reasons for the selection of the Isles of Scilly as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). Annet is the ″British stronghold″ for the lichen Roccella fuciformis.A description of the island by Hilda Quick, a former resident of St Agnes published in 1964 is still relevant today:Many people are disappointed at being unable to visit the famous bird sanctuary, but in fact, there is very little to see there by day. There will be shearwater corpses lying about, (victims of the gulls) several large colonies of gulls, some oystercatchers, rock pipits, and wrens. The walking on the island is horrid, much of it over loose stones hidden in long grass, some bramble and bracken, and awkward great clumps of thrift. What Annet is famous for is its colonies of Manx shearwaters and storm petrels; but since they nest underground, and only come and go in the dark, there is nothing to be seen of them by day.

40|$|Asiatic <b>sand</b> <b>sedge</b> is a {{perennial}} sedge which grows {{to about a}} foot in height. The stem is triangular, and {{the base of the}} stem is covered with brown scales. Young leaves are yellow-green in color and stiff with a rough texture along their edges. Older, basal leaves are somewhat wider, darker green in color and leathery to the touch. The leaves are often taller than the flowering heads of the plant. Flowering heads are either male or female, and are crowded into dense clusters at the tops of the stems. Female flower clusters are longer and more slender than the more cylindrical male flower clusters. The fruits are triangular nutlets known as achenes and are enclosed in a papery sac surrounded below by scales and bracts. Asiatic <b>sand</b> <b>sedge</b> spreads rapidly by underground stems. Distribution Asiatic <b>sand</b> <b>sedge</b> is an east Asian native which was introduced into coastal sands from New Jersey to Virginia in the 1930 ’s for erosion control and as a sand stabilizer. The plant is typically found on coastal dunes and berms, although it is also occasionally found in dry, sandy inland areas. In Virginia, it was introduced into the Sandbridge area and has recently been documented in Accomack County and the cities of Virginia Beach and Chesapeake. Its tolerance for salt spray and high winds allows it to survive in dune habitats occupied by unique native vegetation. Threats The stems of Asiatic <b>sand</b> <b>sedge</b> form low, dense mats in dunes which crowd out native dune species such as American beach grass, coastal spurge, sea oats, and sea-coast marsh elder. Once established, Asiatic <b>sand</b> <b>sedge</b> dramatically changes the profile of a dune. Tall, native plants such as sea oats buffer the dune from the strong forces of wind and salt spray. When native plants are crowded out by the low-growing Asiatic <b>sand</b> <b>sedge,</b> the dunes are vulnerable to shifting sands and blowouts. Control Early detection of this invasive plant is important for successful control, as small populations are easier to manage than larger ones.

The effect on the natural dune {{vegetation}} is evident by a dense coverage of non-native stinging nettles (Uritica dioica), displacing native flora species, such as <b>sand</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex arenaria) and marram grass (Ammophilia arenaria), on this internationally-recognized calcareous dune system. In turn, this is affecting current coastal processes, as dune building has been interrupted {{by the presence of}} vegetation less capable of trapping sand than native dune species. Resultant dune deflation has caused the shoreline to migrate landwards, exposing the tobacco waste, thus creating eroding cliffs (up to 3 m high) of waste and depositing it on the beach.

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of specific plant properties versus soil characteristics in shaping the bacterial community structure of the rhizosphere is a topic of considerable debate. Here, we report {{the results of a}} study on the bacterial composition of the rhizosphere of the wild plant Carex arenaria (<b>sand</b> <b>sedge)</b> growing at 10 natural sites in The Netherlands. The soil properties of the sandy soils at these sites were highly disparate, most notably in pH, chloride and organic matter content. Rhizosphere and bulk soil bacterial communities were examined by culture-independent means, namely, 16 S rDNA-directed PCR-DGGE profiling. Large differences were observed between the bacterial communities of the different sites for both bulk and rhizosphere soil. Cluster analysis of bacterial profiles revealed that the rhizosphere community of each site was generally more closely related to the bulk soil community of that site rather than to rhizosphere communities of other sites. Hence, bacterial community structure within the rhizosphere of C. arenaria appeared to be determined to a large extent by the bulk soil community composition. This conclusion was supported by a reciprocal planting experiment, where C. arenaria shoots of different sites yielded highly similar rhizosphere communities when planted in the same soil [KEYWORDS: Rhizosphere; Bacterial community composition; Soil characteristics; Carex arenaria; PCR-DGGE...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{expansion}} of the nonnative invasive Asiatic <b>sand</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex kobomugi Ohwi) at East Beach State Park, Rhode Island, is reducing populations {{of the most important}} native, dune-building species and their associated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). In contrast to the native American beachgrass (Ammophila breviligulata Fern.) that is dependent upon AMF to thrive in nutrient-poor sand dunes, C. kobomugi does not form beneficial associations with the fungi. Furthermore, assessments suggest that the sedge is competitively superior in obtaining the essential nutrient phosphorous without AMF-facilitation. Analysis of data from transects of the dune system revealed significant negative correlations between distributions of C. kobomugi and A. breviligulata that are being extirpated. Percent cover of A. breviligulata was significantly reduced in areas of C. kobomugi. Other native plant species were not significantly reduced as a result of C. kobomugi expansion. Spore populations of AMF showed significant positive correlations with percent cover of A. breviligulata and significant negative correlations with percent cover of C. kobomugi.

40|$|Knowledge on {{the factors}} that {{determine}} the composition of bacterial communities {{in the vicinity of}} roots (rhizosphere) is essential to understand plant-soil interactions. Plant species identity, plant growth stage and soil properties have been indicated as major determinants of rhizosphere bacterial community composition. Here we show that the presence of saprotrophic fungi can be an additional factor steering rhizosphere bacterial community composition and functioning. We studied the impact of presence of two common fungal rhizosphere inhabitants (Mucor hiemalis and Trichoderma harzianum) on the composition of cultivable bacterial communities developing in the rhizosphere of Carex arenaria (<b>sand</b> <b>sedge)</b> in sand microcosms. Identification and phenotypic characterization of bacterial isolates revealed clear shifts in the rhizosphere bacterial community composition by the presence of two fungal strains (M. hiemalis BHB 1 and T. harzianum PvdG 2), whereas another M. hiemalis strain did not show this effect. Presence of both M. hiemalis BHB 1 and T. harzianum PvdG 2 resulted in a significant increase of chitinolytic and (in vitro) antifungal bacteria. The latter was most pronounced for M. hiemalis BHB 1, an isolate from Carex roots, which stimulated the development of the bacterial genera Achromobacter and Stenotrophomonas. In vitro tests showed that these genera were strongly antagonistic against M. hiemalis but also against the plant-pathogenic fungus Rhizoctonia solani. The most likely explanation for fungal-induced shifts in the composition of rhizosphere bacteria is that bacteria are being selected which are successful in competing with fungi for root exudates. Based on the results we propose that measures increasing saprotrophic fungi in agricultural soils should be explored as an alternative approach to enhance natural biocontrol against soil-borne plant-pathogenic fungi, namely by stimulating indigenous antifungal rhizosphere bacteria...|$|E
