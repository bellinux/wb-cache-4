5000|$|Where {{the life}} {{insurance}} is provided through a superannuation fund, contributions made to fund insurance premiums are tax deductible for <b>self-employed</b> <b>persons</b> and substantially <b>self-employed</b> <b>persons</b> and employers. However where life insurance is held {{outside of the}} superannuation environment, the premiums are generally not tax deductible. For insurance through a superannuation fund, the annual deductible contributions to the superannuation funds are subject to age limits. These limits apply to employers making deductible contributions. They also apply to <b>self-employed</b> <b>persons</b> and substantially <b>self-employed</b> <b>persons.</b> Included in these overall limits are insurance premiums. This means that no additional deductible contributions {{can be made for}} the funding of insurance premiums. Insurance premiums can, however, be funded by undeducted contributions. For further information on deductible contributions see [...] "under what conditions can an employer claim a deduction for contributions made on behalf of their employees?" [...] and [...] "what is the definition of substantially self-employed?". The insurance premium paid by the superannuation fund can be claimed by the fund as a deduction to reduce the 15% tax on contributions and earnings. (Ref: ITAA 1936, Section 279).|$|R

30|$|According to the GSOEP (cf. Saborowski et al. 2004 and own calculations), <b>self-employed</b> <b>persons</b> only take two {{thirds of}} the number of {{holidays}} as compared to employees, which we use to estimate the holiday leave for <b>self-employed</b> <b>persons</b> of each specific industry. For the seasonal distribution of leave, we assume that there is no difference between <b>self-employed</b> <b>persons</b> and employees. For the former, also the extent of sick leave is substantially lower than for employees. However, there are considerable variations in the results of sick leave days for <b>self-employed</b> <b>persons.</b> The statistics of statutory health insurance companies indicate that the number of sick leave days is between one third and one half of those of employees (cf. Küsgens et al. 2002), while the Employment Surveys of the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BIBB) and the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA) indicate values between one third and two thirds. On the basis of these analyses we assume half the sick leave rate of employees. Based on results of the Microcensus, the labour volume performed by <b>persons</b> who are <b>self-employed</b> in a second activity is also considered here.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Employees and <b>self-employed</b> <b>persons</b> have, among others, {{different}} {{personal characteristics}} and different working conditions, which {{may influence the}} prognosis of sick leave and the duration of a disability claim. The {{purpose of the current}} study is to identify prognostic factors for the duration of a disability claim due to non-specific musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) among <b>self-employed</b> <b>persons</b> in the Netherlands. Methods The study population consisted of 276 <b>self-employed</b> <b>persons,</b> who all had a disability claim episode due to MSD with at least 75 % work disability. The study was a cohort study with a follow-up period of 12 months. At baseline, participants filled in a questionnaire with possible individual, work-related and disease-related prognostic factors. Results The following prognostic factors significantly increased claim duration: age > 40 years (Hazard Ratio 0. 54), no similar symptoms in the past (HR 0. 46), having long-lasting symptoms of more than six months (HR 0. 60), self-predicted return to work within more than one month or never (HR 0. 24) and job dissatisfaction (HR 0. 54). Conclusions The prognostic factors we found indicate that for <b>self-employed</b> <b>persons,</b> the duration of a disability claim not only depends on the (history of) impairment of the insured, but also on age, self-predicted return to work and job satisfaction. </p...|$|R
