40|$|AbstractAs a kind {{of solid}} waste, the {{straddle}} <b>type</b> <b>monorail</b> vehicle waste tire was not only increased the operating costs, but also brought environmental pollution problems; {{while at the same}} time the rigidity value of bridge-subgrade transition section in existing monorail system was relative big and the settlement difference still exists between transition section and subgrade, these problems would resulted in tensile failure of the transition section under monorail train loads. In order to solve those problems, an idea that using the modified concrete contains rubber powder of straddle <b>type</b> <b>monorail</b> train waste tire as the material of bridge-subgrade transition section is proposed. The finite element software Midas/GTS was being used to analyse the stress and settlement of bridge-subgrade transition section under static and dynamic load. These results shown that, when the rubber concrete was filled above the reference concrete, the maximum stress of bridge-subgrade transition section reduces significantly, the average reduction value is 34. 82 %. at the same time according to the fact, this new methods will save more than one million operating costs per year of Chongqing monorail transit system...|$|R

40|$|Nonlinear seismic {{behaviors}} of different boundary conditions of transmission line system under earthquake loading are investigated in this paper. The transmission lines are modeled by cable element {{accounting for the}} nonlinearity of the cable. For the <b>suspension</b> <b>type,</b> three towers and two span lines with spring model (Model 1) and three towers and four span lines’ model (Model 2) are established, respectively. For the tension type, three towers and two span lines’ model (Model 3) and three towers and four span lines’ model (Model 4) are created, respectively. The frequencies of the transmission towers and transmission lines of the <b>suspension</b> <b>type</b> and tension type are calculated, respectively. The responses of the <b>suspension</b> <b>type</b> and tension type are investigated using nonlinear time history analysis method, respectively. The {{results show that the}} responses of the transmission tower and transmission line of the two models of the <b>suspension</b> <b>type</b> are slightly different. However, the responses of transmission tower and transmission line of the two models of the tension type are significantly different. Therefore, in order to obtain accurate results, a reasonable model should be considered. The results could provide a reference for the seismic analysis of the transmission tower-line system...|$|R

50|$|Already in 1934 {{it became}} obvious that Renault had been right in advising to select a {{different}} <b>suspension</b> <b>type.</b> The standard one proved to be much too flimsy and especially the oil shock dampers were very maintenance intensive. Both the three vehicles built in 1935 and the two rebuilt prototypes were therefore fitted with an improved AMR 35 <b>suspension</b> <b>type</b> with rubber cylinders. Prototype 79758 had been used to test three different systems: the first with the trailer wheel touching the ground, the second with five road wheels and the last was the one selected. The second type would form the basis for the Renault ZB, a lengthened export version, destined for China.|$|R

40|$|Erupting magma often {{contains}} crystals over a {{wide range}} of sizes and shapes, potentially affecting magma viscosity over many orders of magnitude. A robust relation between viscosity and the modality of crystal sizes and shapes remains lacking, principally because of the dimensional complexity and size of the governing parameter space. We have performed a suite of shear viscosity measurements on liquid-particle suspensions of dynamical similarity to crystal-bearing magma. Our experiments encompass five <b>suspension</b> <b>types,</b> each consisting of unique mixtures of two different particle sizes and shapes. The experiments span two orthogonal subspaces of particle concentration, as well as particle size and shape for each <b>suspension</b> <b>type,</b> thereby providing insight into the topology of parameter space. For each <b>suspension</b> <b>type,</b> we determined the dry maximum packing fraction and measured shear rates across a range of applied shear stresses. The results were fitted using a Herschel-Bulkley model and augment existing predictive capabilities. We demonstrate that our results are consistent with previous work, including friction-based constitutive laws for granular materials. We conclude that predictions for ascent rates of crystal-rich magmas must take the shear-rate dependence of viscosity into account. Shear-rate dependence depends first and foremost on the volume fraction of crystals, relative to the maximum packing fraction, which in turn depends on crystal size and shape distribution...|$|R

40|$|Monorail, was {{put into}} {{operation}} in 1964. Since then, three more monorail systems have been constructed with the active participation of Hitachi in Kitakyushu, Osaka, and Tama. A monorail system is now being constructed in Okinawa; it is scheduled to start operation in 2003. The straddle <b>type</b> <b>monorail</b> can be constructed using the space above public roads without disturbing everyday traffic. Monorail trains with rubber tires are environmentally friendly and produce little noise and vibration. The straddle <b>type</b> <b>monorail</b> has become {{an important part of}} the urban public transportation system, chiefly because of its many advantages over other transportation means including the subway. These advantages include (1) improved environment, (2) a shorter construction period, and (3) lower costs. Thus, the monorail system in Japan is an effective solution to environmental problems and traffic congestion in urban cities, which also stimulates local economy. The demand for urban monorail systems has recently begun to come from smaller local cities where the daily ridership is much lower than that in Tokyo, Osaka, Kitakyushu, and other major cities in Japan. To enhance the financial viability of monorail construction in smaller cities and to construct smaller monorails, the Japan Monorail Association (JMA) set up a research committee to investigate the development of a small monorail. This committee, mainly headed by Hitachi, carried out comprehensive research of the market demand for monorail systems and initiated the development of a compact monorail. Hitachi developed a number of new design elements including an articulated bogie to enable trains to negotiate sharp curves. We also worked to design a compact and light monorail that makes use of next-generation signal systems. These basic elements can also be used for other people-mover systems in amusement parks, airports, and business complexes...|$|R

40|$|Prosthetic {{suspension}} system {{is an important}} component of lower limb prostheses. Suspension efficiency can be best evaluated during one of the vital activities of daily living, i. e. walking. A new magnetic prosthetic {{suspension system}} has been developed, but its effects on gait biomechanics have not been studied. This study aimed to explore the effect of <b>suspension</b> <b>type</b> on kinetic and kinematic gait parameters during level walking with the new suspension system as well as two other commonly used systems (the Seal-In and pin/lock). Thirteen persons with transtibial amputation participated in this study. A Vicon motion system (six cameras, two force platforms) was utilized to obtain gait kinetic and kinematic variables, as well as pistoning within the prosthetic socket. The gait deviation index was also calculated based on the kinematic data. The findings indicated significant difference in the pistoning values among the three suspension systems. The Seal-In system resulted in the least pistoning compared with the other two systems. Several kinetic and kinematic variables were also affected by the <b>suspension</b> <b>type.</b> The ground reaction force data showed that lower load was applied to the limb joints with the magnetic suspension system compared with the pin/lock suspension. The gait deviation index showed significant deviation from the normal with all the systems, but the systems did not differ significantly. Main significant effects of the <b>suspension</b> <b>type</b> were seen in the GRF (vertical and fore-aft), knee and ankle angles. The new magnetic suspension system showed comparable effects in the remaining kinetic and kinematic gait parameters to th...|$|R
