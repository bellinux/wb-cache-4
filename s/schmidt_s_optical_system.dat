40|$|Due to the {{proliferation}} of video cameras, the use of visual methods for surveillance, traffic monitoring, and optical navigation has dramatically increased. However, computer vision algorithms can produce a processing bottleneck. In hopes of addressing the latter, the search for optimal algorithms has explored many different strategies. Some {{have been inspired by}} the efficient natural machine called the fly. Of special importance in those cases is the fly 2 ̆ 7 s eye and its capability for motion detection and further its use in aerial navigation. ^ Within this work, a novel method for tracking moving objects loosely based on the fly is presented. Moreover, taking in consideration some concepts observed in this insect 2 ̆ 7 s visual system, this dissertation describes a cheaper alternative (in a computational sense) for position detection. Of significant benefit, the model 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> origin implies that the gross calculations contained in the approach could potentially be done electro-optically. The presented method detects and tags changes in a scene captured by a camera or other sensing device. The algorithm itself, effectively convolves input images contained in a video stream with a convex-shaped kernel, similar to those in the ommatidium (the basis structure of the fly 2 ̆ 7 s eye). Via the convolution, overlapped power responses at specific points are obtained. These responses can yield a set of intersecting circles that can possibly reveal target positions. By simple triangulation, a transformation to a set of power-crossing points may be done in order to find a final prediction of target position. An arrayed set of these ommatidial elements can form a complex data structure that may be applied to the problem of multi-target and multi-resolution tracking of moving objects with still and mobile camera in real scenes. Printed circuit board (PCB) inspection, surveillance/security, traffic monitoring, and optical navigation are some applications of these efforts and examples of these applications are provided. ...|$|R

40|$|Electron Microscopes (EMs) {{are able}} to take images {{from the inside of}} {{materials}} with atomic resolution and thus, are widely used in material science, biomedical and nanotechnology research. (<b>S)</b> TEMs, unlike <b>optical</b> microscopes, can reveal the internal structure of materials at higher magnifications, i. e. on nano scale, since an electron wave has smaller wavelength compared to a photon wave. The electromagnetic objective lens {{is one of the most}} important components of the (<b>S)</b> TEM <b>optical</b> <b>system</b> and its properties determine the quality of the acquired images. An objective lens can cause so-called ‘optical aberrations’ which are undesirable. To correct these aberrations, so-called aberration correctors can be developed. The correction of these aberrations of which the defocus and two-fold astigmatism are two main aberrations of (S) TEM objective lens, is essential, since defocus can cause image blurring and two-fold astigmatism can reshape an image. Unfortunately, the current aberration correction procedure takes relatively too much time which is undesirable. The time dependency, accuracy and reproducibility are crucial aspects and should be taken into account in order to obtain a high quality operation. Hence, it is essential to develop a defocus and two-fold astigmatism corrector from the systems and control perspective, by means of closed-loop control on the basis of defocus and two-fold astigmatism measurements. To apply closed-loop control, a sensor capable of measuring aberrations from (S) TEM images, is needed. This necessitates, essentially, a careful survey of different available defocus and two-fold astigmatism measurement methods, using (S) TEM images, to be able to define their restrictions and, finally, to find a suitable measurement method. Also, an implementation of the selected method, in Matlab, is required in order to be able to study the behaviour of the defocus and two-fold astigmatism sensor. These topics will be discussed and the results will be presented. Delft Center for Systems and ControlMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
