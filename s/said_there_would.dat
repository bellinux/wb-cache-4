5|$|The group {{increasingly}} {{focused on}} the suppression of sexual desire; Applewhite and seven others opted for surgical castration. They initially had difficulty finding a willing surgeon, but eventually found one in Mexico. In Applewhite's view, sexuality {{was one of the}} most powerful forces that bound humans to their bodies and thus hindered their efforts to evolve to the Next Level; he taught that Next Level beings had no reproductive organs but that Luciferian beings had genders. He also cited a verse in the New Testament that <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> not be marriage in heaven. In addition, he required members to adopt similar clothing and haircuts, possibly to reinforce that they were a non-sexual family.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} 2013 budget the Dunderdale {{government}} announced that the province's four English school boards would be consolidated into one, while the one French school board would remain as is.

The government faced criticism for the amalgamation from people in the education system but despite this Minister Clyde Jackman announced {{the appointment of a}} transition team for the amalgamation on April 24, 2013, with a plan to have the new school board in place for September of that year. The budget also saw reductions in the Department of Education that would affect areas such as administration, learning resources support and district-based numeracy supports.

25|$|On September 10, 2009, the ECC {{ordered the}} invalidation {{of tens of}} {{thousands}} of ballots, mostly votes for Karzai, from 83 polling stations from three provinces. These included all presidential ballots from 5 polling stations in Paktika Province, either all presidential ballots, all provincial council ballots - or in some case both - from 27 polling stations in Ghazni Province, as well as ballots from 51 polling stations in Kandahar Province.

25|$|The {{proposals}} {{included an}} eight-storey flatted factory and 16 workshops with car parking above {{them as well}} as a new Assay Office, School of Jewellery, exhibition hall, restaurant, office block and shop. The flatted factory, known as the Hockley Centre (now the Big Peg), was completed in 1971. The workshops with the car parking space was completed in 1978 to the north of this. The scheme was not a success as there were complaints over the higher rent prices and many of the 150 firms that were displaced by the development moved elsewhere in the Quarter. As a result, the council abandoned the plan to progress further with the development and <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no more large scale redevelopment in the area.|$|E

25|$|However, on September 3, 2014, {{the cause}} was {{suspended}} indefinitely, not for problems with Sheen's moral character or with the miracle investigation, but because the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, within whose territory he is buried, had refused a request by Bishop Jenky of Peoria (who is the Actor, or supervisor, of the cause efforts because of his position as Bishop of Peoria) to have Archbishop Sheen's remains moved to Peoria. This {{needed to be done}} so the body could be closely examined and first-class relics taken, both of which are among the final steps that take place before beatification and canonization. The cause for his beatification, per the Vatican's directions, will be archived in the historical records of the Congregation for Saints' Causes. The Peoria Diocese <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no further immediate comment.|$|E

The Sun, plagued by a late-season injury to all-star Asjha Jones missed the playoffs {{for the first time since}} moving from Orlando.
