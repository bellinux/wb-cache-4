50|$|On February 10, Busch {{announced}} that he would <b>skip</b> the <b>truck</b> series race at Daytona to focus on racing in the Daytona 500. During the second Budweiser Duel, Busch dominated {{the first half of the}} race. However he was called for a stop-and-go-penalty for speeding exiting pit road. He restarted the second half of the race in 23rd spot. He performed a tremendous comeback, coming back to the front of the field within 15 laps of the penalty, finishing second behind former Hendrick Motorsports teammate Jimmie Johnson.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 2005, O'Quinn was a {{contestant}} on Roush Racing: Driver X. He was ultimately runner-up in the competition, but <b>skipped</b> the Craftsman <b>Truck</b> Series and proceeded directly to the Busch Series with Driver X winner Erik Darnell being inked to the Roush truck contract.|$|R
60|$|In {{the present}} day, {{machinery}} being more perfect, the ancient kibble {{has been to}} some extent supplanted by <b>skips,</b> or small <b>trucks</b> with wheels (in some cases iron boxes with guiding-rods), which are drawn up smoothly, and without much tear and wear; but in the rough times of which we write, the sturdy kibble used to go rattling up the shaft with deafening noise, dinting its thick sides, and travelling with a jovial free-and-easy swing that must have added considerably to the debit side of the account of working expenses. Between the pump-rod and the kibble-way there was just room for the ladders upon which Captain Dan, followed by Oliver, now stepped. This shaft was very wet, water dropped and spirted about in fine spray everywhere, and the rounds of the ladders were wet and greasy with much-squeezed slime.|$|R
40|$|Gasification {{of biomass}} for {{electricity}} power generation {{has been a}} proven technology {{in a number of}} countries in the world. MSW consists of biomass, glass, plastics, metallic scrap and street debris. Biomass constitutes the highest proportion of MSW and being an energy resource, implies that it can contribute tremendously to the energy needs of any country since every country is endowed with this resource which is generated in enormous tonnes per day. The challenge would then be the choice of the technology to harness this abundant energy resource subject to financial and environmental constraints.    In Uganda, MSW gasification for power generation has never been implemented in spite of the 500 - 600 tonnes of MSW collected per day, the biomass component of the MSW comprising 88 %. MSW is instead collected in <b>skips,</b> transported by <b>trucks</b> to a landfill were it is deposited and left to decompose releasing methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) gases which are highly potent greenhouse gases. In this regard, the many tonnes per day of MSW collected in Kampala city (area of the study) portray significant potential of generating producer gas using the technology of gasification to run engines for power generation and this study evaluated possible gasifier-engine system applications for power generation. Experiments were carried out  at the Faculty of Technology, Makerere University to determine biomass characteristics (e. g. moisture content, ash content) and gasification parameters(e. g. lower heating value)   of MSW required for gasifier-engine applications. After establishing the lower heating value of the producer gas from MSW, a theoretical design of a gasifier-engine system was investigated for possible applications with the biomass component of MSW and an economic analysis was done to assess the feasibility of the project...|$|R
