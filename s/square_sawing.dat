40|$|This work {{describes}} a simulation of {{the removal of}} knots from square-sawn wood and from wood sawn with the star-sawing pattern. The efficiency of the two methods is compared {{according to the length}} of the received boards and the volume exchange. The production of wood free from knots is important since the market demands wood without knots for reasons of both appearance and material properties. The simulation is done with data for trees and logs taken from The Swedish Stem Bank. The data is then used to simulate the sawmill process in a computer program called the Virtual Sawmill. Data related to the received boards are then used in a MATLAB model simulating the cross cutting of knots. The simulation gave a mean knot-free board length of 263 ± 100 mm and a spillage of 15. 9 % when logs with a top diameter of 100 - 370 mm are square sawn. Star sawing simulated for logs with a top diameter exceeding 230 mm gave a mean knot-free board length of 417 ± 321 mm, while the mean length of knot-free boards was 298 ± 122 mm for <b>square</b> <b>sawing</b> when simulating sawing of the same logs. Under these conditions the volume losses for cross cutting is 9 % for star sawing and 13 % for <b>square</b> <b>sawing.</b> This shows that star sawing has a potential for the production of knot-free wood...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1991 The Best Opening Face (BOF) log {{breakdown}} {{model was}} modified {{to keep track}} of growth ring angle and growth ring density in boards. The model was used {{to determine the effects of}} producing rectangular rather than square pencil stock. While an increase in volume did result, there was also a decrease in pencil stock quality regarding ring angle due to the lack of choice left in orienting these pencil stock when producing slats. The results were expressed as the percentage of change that occurred in both volume and value recovery between rectangular and <b>square</b> <b>sawing.</b> Overall, when considering both pencil stock prices and ring angle factors, there was an increase in value of 0. 64...|$|E
40|$|The PrimWood method. Part 1 : Properties and {{production}} of timber with vertical annual rings. Old traditions and modern measurements show that radial sawn wood is subject to smaller moisture movements in {{the plane of the}} surface and has a harder surface and better shape-stability than timber sawn by conventional sawing techniques such as <b>square</b> <b>sawing</b> and through-and-through sawing. The advantages are greater if the juvenile wood is removed. Timber with radial faces and where the juvenile wood has been removed is said to have vertical annual rings, and such timber is particularly valuable for products such as floors, furniture, panels and exterior carpentry. The special properties of the timber are then utilised in the best possible manner. The PrimWood method is a new production concept for the manufacture of high quality wood components and boards of massive wood from both softwood and hardwood. The concept leads to a knot-free material with vertical annual rings. Upprättat; 2007; 20140902 (dicsan...|$|E

40|$|Althergebrachte Traditionen, sowie später erfolgte Messungen haben bewiesen, dass Holz welches mit radialen Sägeschnitten gesägt wurde, geringere feuchtigkeitsbedingte Bewegungen an der Holzoberfläche, eine höhere Oberflächenhärte, sowie eine höhere Formstabilität aufzeigt, als Holz welches mit traditionellen Methoden wie Vorschneiden und Blockschneiden gesägt wurde. Diese Vorteile nehmen zu, wenn das {{juvenile}} Holz entfernt wird. Holz, bei dem die Breitseiten radial sind und bei dem das juvenile Holz entfern wurde, hat so genannte stehende Jahresringe. Holz mit stehenden Jahresringen ist besonders wertvoll für die Herstellung von Tischlerarbeiten, Möbeln und Fußböden und Paneelen. Bei diesen Produkten werden die besonderen Eigenschaften des Holzes am Besten ausgenutzt.

50|$|During the Shah dynasty that followed, the Kathmandu Durbar <b>Square</b> <b>saw</b> {{a number}} of changes. Two {{of the most unusual}} temples in the square were built during this time. One is the Nautale, a nine-storied {{building}} known as Basantapur Durbar. It has four roofs and stands at the end of Nasal Chok at the East side of the palace. It is said that this building was set as a pleasure house. The lower three stories were made in the Newari farmhouse style. The upper floors have Newari style windows, sanjhya and tikijhya, {{and some of them are}} slightly projected from the wall. The other temple is annexed to the Vasantapur Durbar and has four stories. This building was initially known as Vilasamandira, or Lohom Chok, but is now commonly known as Basantapur or Tejarat Chok. The lower floors of the Basantapur Chok display extensive woodcarvings and the roofs are made in popular the Mughal style. Archives state that Prthivi Narayan Shah built these two buildings in 1770.|$|R

40|$|In this letter, a {{large scale}} {{investigation}} is carried out, utilizing several spectral shapes as the source for direct modulation based frequency dithering (DMFD). DMFD mitigates the nonlinear effect of long term evolution (LTE) radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems. The dithering signal shapes are; sine, <b>square,</b> <b>saw,</b> sinc and Gaussian with different spectral width characteristics. We show that by varying the dithering signal with increasing spectral width, no additional distortion is introduced in the linear and optimum optical launch power regions, which are dominated by the frequency chirp and chromatic dispersion (CD). Additionally, it is revealed herein that introducing dithering signals with varying spectral widths {{does not change the}} nonlinear compensator characteristic towards suppression of nonlinearity. The {{reason for this is that}} as long as the optical source linewidth is larger than stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) linewidth, the proposed method completely suppresses SBS. Finally, the degree of freedom for the dithering signal is infinite, with an optical power budget improvement of up to 8 dB at an optical launch power of 10 dBm, which can in turn be used towards connecting multiple relay nodes (RNs) ...|$|R
