5|$|Even {{though his}} {{military}} career begun {{almost as an}} afterthought, or by accident, Zamoyski is also remembered {{as one of the}} most accomplished Polish military commanders. In his tactics, he favored sieges, flanking maneuvers, conserving his forces, and the new Western art of fortification and artillery. The war with Muscovy <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> to be a skilled commander in sieges, and latter events would prove him to be an equally able leader in the open field.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Fiacco, a cellist, {{arrived at}} Carriage House first. He {{was dressed in}} formal black and white attire, having {{traveled}} from an afternoon concert. Fiacco {{was surprised to find}} there were no scores written for the musicians to play; he then wrote a part based on riffs Francis had <b>shown</b> <b>him.</b> The violinists, Corinne Metter and Karen Karlsrud, also followed the directions of Francis and Norton. Another cellist, Ann Rorich, credited on the album and single, was sent home; according to Fiacco he doubled her parts.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{importance}} of his title, Thơ rarely appeared with Diệm in public and was a figurehead with little influence. The real power lay with Diệm's younger brothers, Nhu and Cẩn, who commanded private armies and secret police, as well as giving orders directly to ARVN generals. Nhu reportedly once ordered a bodyguard to slap Thơ because he felt Thơ had <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> a lack of respect. Diệm held Thơ in contempt and did not allow him {{to take part in}} major policy decisions, despite theoretically being the second most powerful man in the country. Thơ had a rapport with the military officers, having befriended Minh years earlier. He was regarded as a genial and affable administrator with a reputation for making compromises.|$|E
6000|$|They also <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> some of {{the engines}} with which some of his {{servants}} had done wonderful things. They <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> Moses' rod; the hammer and nail with which Jael slew Sisera; the pitchers, trumpets, and lamps too, with which Gibeon put to flight the armies of Midian. Then they <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> the ox's goad wherewith Shamgar slew 600 men. They <b>showed</b> <b>him,</b> also, the jaw-bone with which Samson did such mighty feats. They <b>showed</b> <b>him,</b> moreover, the sling and stone with which David slew Goliath of Gath; and the sword, also, with which their Lord will kill the Man of Sin, in {{the day that he}} shall rise up to the prey. They <b>showed</b> <b>him,</b> besides, many excellent things, with which Christian was much delighted. This done, they went to their rest again.[80] ...|$|R

5|$|Edward's unorthodox {{approach}} to his role also {{extended to the}} coinage that bore his image. He broke with the tradition that the profile portrait of each successive monarch faced in the direction opposite to that {{of his or her}} predecessor. Edward insisted that he face left (as his father had done), to show the parting in his hair. Only a handful of test coins were struck before the abdication, and all are very rare. When George VI succeeded to the throne he also faced left to maintain the tradition by suggesting that, had any further coins been minted featuring Edward's portrait, they would have <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> facing right.|$|E
5|$|The first {{non-indigenous}} settler at Wolf Point {{may have}} been a trader named Guarie. Writing in 1880 Gurdon Hubbard, who first arrived in Chicago on October 1, 1818, stated that he had been told of Guarie by Antoine De Champs and Antoine Beson, who had been traversing the Chicago Portage annually since about 1778. Hubbard wrote that De Champs had <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> evidence of a trading house and the remains of a cornfield supposed to have belonged to Guarie. The cornfield was located on {{the west bank of the}} North Branch of the Chicago River, a short distance from the forks at what is now Fulton Street; early settlers named the North Branch of the Chicago River the Guarie River, or Gary's River.|$|E
5|$|Arha and Kossil have {{a public}} falling out in which Kossil says that nobody {{believes}} in the Nameless Ones anymore. In response Arha curses her {{in the name of}} the Nameless Ones. Realizing that Kossil will now be determined to kill her, she heads underground to the labyrinth, and sees Kossil uncovering the false grave. Evading her, Arha goes to the treasury and confesses everything to Ged, who has found the other half of Erreth-Akbe's ring in the treasury. He tells Arha that she must either kill him or escape with him, and says that the Nameless Ones demand her service but give nothing and create nothing in return. He tells her his true name, Ged, in return for the trust she has <b>shown</b> <b>him.</b> They escape together, though Manan, who has come looking for Arha, falls into a pit in the labyrinth and is killed. The tombs begin to collapse in on themselves; Ged holds them off until they leave. Arha reverts to calling herself Tenar as she and Ged travel to the coast where his boat is hidden. While waiting for the tide she has an urge to kill Ged for destroying her life, but realizes while gazing at him that she has no anger left. Ged and Tenar return to Havnor, where they are received in triumph.|$|E

25|$|Ancient coins of the Yaudheyas, {{dated to}} 1st and 2nd century CE, show Kartikeya as a warrior with either one or six heads. Kushan coins <b>show</b> <b>him</b> with one head. In general, single head {{is far more}} common {{regardless}} of which dynasty minted them. The earliest statues discovered in Punjab and Kashmir <b>show</b> <b>him</b> with either one or six heads. The oldest sculptures such as those found in Mathura <b>show</b> <b>him</b> with one head, while six head iconography is dated to post-Gupta Empire era. All Kushan Empire era artwork <b>show</b> <b>him</b> with one head, {{even though there are}} Kushan deities such as a goddess who is shown with multiple heads.|$|R

25|$|Diaz {{displays}} {{an unusual}} boxing style for MMA, relying upon volume punching without full power and occasionally adding in hard punches.

25|$|Bollier {{testified at}} the trial that the Scottish police had {{originally}} <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> a fragment of a brown 8-ply circuit board, of a prototype timer which had never been supplied to Libya. Yet the sample {{he was asked to}} identify {{at the trial}} was a green 9-ply circuit board that Mebo had indeed supplied to Libya. Bollier wanted to pursue this discrepancy, but was told by trial Judge, Lord Sutherland, that he could not do so.|$|E

25|$|The rest of {{the book}} loosely follows the {{original}} Phantom of the Opera novel - differing on several points but following the relationship between Erik and {{the object of his}} desire, Christine Daae, and switching back and forth between their points of view. The relationship between Christine and Erik is explored in greater detail and with greater compassion than the original novel, allowing Erik to finally find love and redemption in a world that has <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> nothing but cruelty since birth.|$|E
25|$|In February 2010, an Arab country's unnamed {{ambassador}} to Dubai had his marriage annulled after discovering that his bride was cross-eyed and had facial hair. The woman had worn a niqab on the occasions {{that the couple}} had met prior to the wedding. The ambassador informed the Sharia court {{that he had been}} deliberately deceived by the bride's mother, who had <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> photographs of the bride's sister. He only discovered this when he lifted the niqab to kiss his bride. The court annulled the marriage, but refused a claim for compensation.|$|E
25|$|The same {{passage from}} the Jerusalem Talmud refers to Elisha as being alive when his pupil Rabbi Meir had become a renowned teacher. According to the {{assumption}} made above, he must have reached his seventieth year at that time. If Elisha were a Sadducee, the friendship constantly <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> by Rabbi Meïr could be understood. This friendship {{would have been impossible}} had Elisha been an apostate or a man of loose morals, as has been asserted. Sadducees and Pharisees, however, lived in friendly intercourse with one another (for example, Rabban Gamaliel with Sadducees; Eruvin 77b).|$|E

25|$|Gellius, however, {{showed no}} {{gratitude}} for the leniency which had been <b>shown</b> <b>him,</b> but deserted to the triumvirs, Augustus and Mark Antony. While in their service he had coins struck, on which he appears with the title of Q. P. that is, Quaestor Propraetore. He was rewarded for his treachery by the consulship in 36 BC. In the war between Octavian and Antony, he espoused {{the side of the}} latter, and commanded the right wing of Antony's fleet at the battle of Actium. As he is not mentioned again, he probably perished in the action.|$|E
25|$|Akaitcho {{explained}} why Fort Enterprise {{had not been}} stocked with food as promised. Part of the reason was that three of his hunters had been killed when they fell through the ice on a frozen lake, and {{he had not been}} supplied with ammunition at Fort Providence, but he admitted the main reason the fort had been abandoned; he had believed that the white men's expedition was the height of folly, and that they would not return to Fort Enterprise alive. In spite of this, Franklin refused to blame Akaitcho, who had <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> much kindness during the rescue, and, because of the ongoing dispute between the fur companies, had not received the payment he had been promised.|$|E
25|$|German Orientalist, mathematician, inventor, poet, and {{librarian}} Daniel Schwenter {{wrote in}} his 1636 book Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae about an instrument that a man from Pappenheim had <b>shown</b> <b>him,</b> which enabled movement of a lens to project more from a scene through the camera obscura. It consisted of a ball {{as big as a}} fist, through which a hole (AB) was made with a lens attached on one side (B). This ball was placed inside two halves of part of a hollow ball that were then glued together (CD), in which it could be turned around. This device was attached to a wall of the camera obscura (EF). This universal joint mechanism was later called a scioptric ball.|$|E

25|$|The matter {{came before}} the heads of houses, and {{there was talk of}} Preston's {{expulsion}} from the university. At the suggestion of Lancelot Andrewes, then Bishop of Ely, Preston was directed to declare his judgment regarding forms of prayer in a sermon at St. Botolph's. He acquitted himself so as to silence complaint. Soon afterwards he was summoned to preach before the king at Finchingbrook, near Royston, Cambridgeshire. James highly approved his argument against the Arminians; he would have <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> less favour had he known that Preston was the author of a paper against the Spanish match, circulated with much secrecy among members of the House of Lords. He was proposed as a royal chaplain by James Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Abercorn, but James thought this premature.|$|E
25|$|In his affidavit, Weir recounted when in March 1976 he {{had gone}} to the farm where between eight and ten men dressed in {{camouflage}} had been parading in the farmyard. Inside he had discussed with Mitchell and others the details of a planned bombing and shooting attack against a nationalist pub, Tully's in Belleeks. Mitchell had <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> the floor plans of the pub's interior which he had drawn up highlighting the lack of escape routes for the pub's patrons. The plan was temporarily called off when it was discovered that the British Army's Parachute Regiment was on patrol that evening in the area. Weir returned to Belfast the next day and the attack went ahead that evening, 8 March. There were no casualties, however, as Mitchell's floor plans had been inaccurate, and the customers had fled into the pub's living quarters for safety once the shooting had commenced outside, and the bomb only caused structural damage to the building.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, 1977, in the New York Yankees' 10–4 {{loss to the}} Boston Red Sox in {{a nationally}} {{televised}} game at Fenway Park in Boston, Jim Rice, a powerful hitter but a slow runner, hit a ball into right field that Reggie Jackson seemed to get to without much speed, and Rice reached second base. Furious, Yankees manager Billy Martin removed Jackson from the game without even waiting {{for the end of}} the inning, sending Paul Blair out to replace him. When Jackson arrived at the dugout, Martin yelled that Jackson had <b>shown</b> <b>him</b> up. The two men argued, and Jackson said that Martin's heavy drinking had impaired his judgment. Despite Jackson being eighteen years younger, about two inches taller and maybe 40 pounds heavier, Martin lunged at him, and had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard. Red Sox fans could see this in the dugout and began cheering wildly; NBC television cameras showed the confrontation to the entire country.|$|E
