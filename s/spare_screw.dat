50|$|The {{original}} picket was a stake hammered {{into the}} ground to secure a horse by tying it to the stake. This required a second tool (a hammer) or {{the availability of a}} rock to use instead of a tool. The screw picket is screwed (by turning it) {{into the ground}}. In hard ground, it requires a second tool (a leverage bar, or a <b>spare</b> <b>screw</b> picket) or the availability of a length of wood. Screw pickets can be easily bent or broken, but less easily pulled from the ground.|$|E
60|$|Screw {{to secure}} the Cock.--In common guns, this screw is very liable to get loose, fall out and be lost; it is {{therefore}} desirable to have one or more <b>spare</b> <b>screws.</b>|$|R
500|$|Their {{propulsion}} system consisted of four-shaft Parsons steam turbines and twelve coal-fired water-tube Yarrow boilers. The turbines drove three-bladed screw propellers that were [...] wide in diameter. Two <b>spare</b> <b>screws</b> were kept aboard each ship. The boilers were trunked {{into a single}} funnel that was placed amidships; {{the location of the}} funnel, far from the foremast, kept the latter's spotting top free from smoke interference, but still rendered the spotting top on the mainmast essentially useless.|$|R
50|$|The boxes include {{accessory}} attachments for hemming, braiding, underbraiding, tucking, shirring, binding, quilting, and ruffling, plus <b>spare</b> needles, bobbins, <b>screws,</b> and screwdrivers.|$|R
2500|$|Singer {{accessory}} kits {{were sold}} in fold-out 'Style' boxes, numbered consecutively as newer versions evolved from older ones. [...] The numbers begin at 1 ("Style No. 1") and culminate at 14 during {{the era of the}} 27 model series. [...] The boxes included accessory attachments for hemming, braiding, underbraiding, tucking, shirring, binding, quilting, and ruffling, plus <b>spare</b> needles, bobbins, <b>screws,</b> and screwdrivers.|$|R
50|$|Guard Cooke was in {{the rear}} brake van of the train, {{together}} with six passengers, who {{should not have been}} there. Cooke and his passengers were drinking and smoking in the van, and Cooke invited passengers to apply the van handbrake. Correct operation of the brake was necessary, not only to slow the train, but also to control the tension in the carriage couplings. There were three separate breakages of couplings ahead of the rear brake van on the outward journey: at Brettell Lane and Hagley both the main screw couplings and side safety chains failed, and at Droitwich it was found that another screw coupling was failed, but its associated side chains had held. Cooke made temporary repairs on all three occasions. To repair the first two breakages, Cooke managed to find <b>spare</b> three-link or <b>screw</b> couplings; but at Droitwich he was only able to patch up the side chains, which were not designed to hold the full weight of a train. On arrival at Worcester, the train was examined by the inspector of rolling stock: the repaired/replaced side chains were replaced by four-link goods couplings before the return journey, but no attempt was made to repair or replace failed centre couplings: these were difficult to access, and the inspector considered that a re-made screw coupling was weaker than the goods couplings (which he considered adequate).|$|R
