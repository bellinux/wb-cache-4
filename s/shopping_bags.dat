5|$|The video {{progresses}} as Carey, now on {{the streets}} of New York, is walking towards the hotel. As she begins to notice the bellhop, dressed in the sweats, pursuing her, she turns around in haste and begins jolting back to the hotel while holding several <b>shopping</b> <b>bags.</b> Additionally, scenes of the stalker's home are shown again, this time more elaborately, with his walls covered with portraits of the singer, as well as album covers and lights around a large photo of her. As the video comes to an end, she waits for her limousine to arrive at the hotel. However, before she gets inside, she notices the stalker attempting to take a picture of her. She then looks directly into his camera and gives a smile. The video then shows him again, still attempting to take a picture, right before a bus hits him. Carey gasps in shock after witnessing the incident. The remix video for the song features the same story-line and footage, only showing inter-cut scenes of Carey dressed in a white ensemble, while laying on a vintage wooden table. As Gucci Mane stands next to her in a white suit, he pours her champagne and hands her the glass.|$|E

25|$|<b>Shopping</b> <b>bags</b> are {{medium-sized}} bags, typically around 10-20 litres (2.5 to 5 gallons) in volume, {{that are}} often used by grocery shoppers to carry home their purchases.

U.S. patent #1,305,198 was issued to Deubener on May 27, 1919.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{method of}} waste management is {{the prevention of}} waste material being created, also known as waste reduction. Methods of avoidance include reuse of second-hand products, repairing broken items instead of buying new, designing products to be refillable or reusable (such as cotton instead of plastic <b>shopping</b> <b>bags),</b> encouraging consumers to avoid using disposable products (such as disposable cutlery), removing any food/liquid remains from cans and packaging, and designing products that use less material {{to achieve the same}} purpose (for example, lightweighting of beverage cans).|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} form of degradation, however, is a {{decrease}} in polymer chain length. Mechanisms which break polymer chains are familiar to biologists because of their effect on DNA: ionizing radiation (most commonly ultraviolet light), free radicals, and oxidizers such as oxygen, ozone, and chlorine. Ozone cracking is a well-known problem affecting natural rubber for example. Plastic additives can slow these process very effectively, and {{can be as simple as}} a UV-absorbing pigment (e.g. titanium dioxide or carbon black). Plastic <b>shopping</b> <b>bags</b> often do not include these additives so that they break down more easily as ultrafine particles of litter.|$|E
25|$|Ireland {{became the}} first {{country in the world}} to {{introduce}} an environmental levy for plastic <b>shopping</b> <b>bags</b> in 2002 and a public smoking ban in 2004. Recycling in Ireland is carried out extensively and Ireland has the second highest rate of packaging recycling in the European Union. It was the first country in Europe to ban incandescent lightbulbs in 2008 and the first EU country to ban in-store tobacco advertising and product display in 2009. In 2015 Ireland became the second country in the world to introduce plain cigarette packaging. Despite the above measures to discourage tobacco use, smoking rates in Ireland remain above 20% of the adult population and above those in other developed countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{video is}} set in a {{colorful}} city and has a futuristic theme to it. The storyline of the video begins with Jordan dropping off her boyfriend at a bus stop, as they appear to be breaking up. She is seen sitting in the backseat of her orange AMC Pacer, and starts to sing the song's first verse, just as the wind begins to pick up, sliding her car and the bus stop, where her boyfriend is at, in opposite directions. Throughout the video, the city moves in motion. It is intercut with other scenes, including Jordan dancing with four other back-up dancers at a swimming pool, a man reading a newspaper while holding a Dalmatian dog by its leash, and also a woman with a few <b>shopping</b> <b>bags.</b> During the car scenes, Jordan sees flashbacks of her boyfriend in the car's rear-view mirror. She later realises that he makes her happy and moves to the driver's seat, to stop the car. Jordan then reverses the car, sending her back to the bus stop.|$|E
50|$|A {{reusable}} <b>shopping</b> <b>bag,</b> {{sometimes called}} bag-for-life in the UK, {{is a type}} of <b>shopping</b> <b>bag</b> which can be reused many times.

25|$|Plastic {{products}} are printed with numbers 1–7 {{depending on the}} type of resin. Type 1 (polyethylene terephthalate) is commonly found in soft drink and water bottles. Type 2 (high-density polyethylene) is found in most hard plastics such as milk jugs, laundry detergent bottles, and some dishware. Type 3 (polyvinyl chloride) includes items such as shampoo bottles, shower curtains, hula hoops, credit cards, wire jacketing, medical equipment, siding, and piping. Type 4 (low-density polyethylene) is found in <b>shopping</b> <b>bags,</b> squeezable bottles, tote bags, clothing, furniture, and carpet. Type 5 is polypropylene and makes up syrup bottles, straws, Tupperware, and some automotive parts. Type 6 is polystyrene and makes up meat trays, egg cartons, clamshell containers, and compact disc cases. Type 7 includes all other plastics such as bulletproof materials, 3- and 5-gallon water bottles, and sunglasses. Having a recycling code or the chasing arrows logo on a material is not an automatic indicator that a material is recyclable but rather an explanation of what the material is. Types 1 and 2 are the most commonly recycled.|$|E
500|$|In January 2008, Stelmach {{unveiled}} the province's [...] "made in Alberta"—as distinct from {{imposed by the}} federal government or by international treaty—plan to cut carbon emissions in order to fight global warming. [...] The plan called for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 14% (from 2007 levels) by 2050. Environmental groups and opposition parties suggested that this was insufficient in light of British Columbia's plan to cut emissions by 80% (from 2007 levels) during the same period, but Stelmach argued that Alberta's position as a supplier of oil {{to the rest of the}} country justified higher emissions. This was followed in June by the unveiling of the government's campaign to ask Albertans to make [...] "one simple act"—such as composting, using reusable <b>shopping</b> <b>bags,</b> and replacing incandescent light bulbs with the more efficient fluorescent bulbs. Opponents argued that the emphasis on personal responsibility by individuals did nothing to address the greater environmental damage caused by the development of the Athabasca Oil Sands.|$|E
500|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{has decided}} to boycott the Steamtown Mall after a shop owner refuses to serve him, {{going so far as}} to cancel orders to {{businesses}} there. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and the rest of the office convince Dwight to get revenge on the shop owner by making Dwight appear to be high-class, and then having him refuse to buy from the shop, a scheme the office references from the movie Pretty Woman. Using tips from the rest of the office to make himself appear more sophisticated, Dwight, with Jim and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), return to the shop. To their surprise, the shop owner immediately recognizes Dwight even in his new attire, and explains that they did not serve him before because they were intimidated by his blood-soaked hands (actually beet juice). Dwight, somewhat flustered from the truth of the situation being revealed to him, stumbles over his words before finally saying the line he had come all the way there to say, [...] "You made a big mistake. Huge!", while waving his <b>shopping</b> <b>bags.</b> The group leaves somewhat embarrassed, but not before Dwight buys what he came for: a pewter wizard statuette holding a crystal ball.|$|E
