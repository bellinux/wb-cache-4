25|$|In 2007 Donnelly was a cosponsor of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIP). Appropriating over $60 {{billion over}} 5 years by {{matching}} {{federal funds to}} states that provide health insurance to children and pregnant women, and raising the federal cigarette tax from 39 cents to $1. After CHIP passed the House and the Senate, President George W. Bush vetoed the bill over a $30 billion spending difference between what he and congress proposed, saying that “Because the Congress has chosen to <b>send</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> bill that moves {{our health care system}} in the wrong direction, I must veto it,” and that lawmakers should “produce a good bill that puts poorer children first.” After Bush's decision on CHIP, Donnelly joined 217 Democrats and 42 Republicans in a failed measure to override Bush's veto. In 2009 after Bush left office, the House passed a new version of CHIP, and President Barack Obama signed it into law. The new version including the original expansion of coverage to 4 million children, and along with raising taxes on cigarettes, a new provision was added to raise taxes on other tobacco products.|$|E

[...] South Carolinians dutifully voted out their representatives as Tillman requested. Although no primary for governor was permitted, the delegates to the nominating convention were elected by the Democratic voters, and Tillman won an overwhelming victory over Sheppard, who took only four of thirty-five counties. The convention was mostly Tillmanite, and gave the governor an easy triumph. The Conservatives had agreed not to bolt the party, and Tillman won uncontested re-election.|$|E

He described the work as [...] "all I know of painting", and responded positively to statements {{that it was his}} masterpiece. In a 1914 interview, he explained that he had not meant to sell the painting, as it [...] "was [...] wife's favorite picture".

500|$|American singer Gloria Estefan, {{whose husband}} Emilio Estefan was {{managing}} Shakira at that time, felt that Shakira {{had the potential}} to crossover into the mainstream pop industry. However, Shakira was initially hesitant to record songs in English as it was not her first language, so Estefan offered to translate [...] "Ojos Así" [...] into English in order to show her that [...] "it could translate well." [...] Shakira then began translating the song herself and showed it to Estefan, who responded [...] "Quite honestly, I can't do this better!." [...] As Shakira wanted to have full control over her recordings, she decided to learn English better to enable her to write her own songs. Wanting to [...] "find a way to express my ideas and my feelings, my day-to-day stories in English", Shakira bought rhyming dictionaries, started analysing the lyrics of songs by Bob Dylan, reading poetry and the work of authors like Leonard Cohen and Walt Whitman and took English lessons from a private tutor. [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] became the first song Shakira wrote in English and in an interview with Faze, she talked about the writing process of the song, saying [...] "I prayed and asked God to <b>send</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> good song today, and I remember I started writing the song [...] a couple of hours after.

2500|$|The band's first {{official}} album, <b>Send</b> <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> Lullaby, produced by The Go-Betweens and Tony Cohen, on Missing Link in Australia, was released as an eight-track mini-album in November 1981. Missing Link's UK distributors, Rough Trade, released the album in the UK, three months later, with four tracks added. Morrison provided the album title, in preference to Two Wimps and a Witch, from a Zelda Fitzgerald novel Save Me the Waltz. The group {{had developed a}} subtler sound consisting of dry semi-spoken vocals, complex lyrics and melodic but fractious guitar pop influenced by contemporary bands such as Television, Wire and Talking Heads. Australian rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, described the album as [...] "tentative and clumsy [...] its brittle, rough-hewn sound". Forster and McLennan wrote all the tracks, they alternated lead vocal duties, except [...] "People Know" [...] which had Morrison on vocals and James Freud (Models) guesting on saxophone. Enticed by Rough Trade, the band relocated to London. The band's next single, [...] "Hammer the Hammer", was released by Rough Trade, in July 1982. In 2002, UK label Circus released a 2× CD version of <b>Send</b> <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> Lullaby which included [...] "After the Fireworks" [...] recorded as a collaboration with The Birthday Party's Nick Cave on vocals, Mick Harvey on piano and Rowland S.
