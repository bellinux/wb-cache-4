5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, Ima {{did not have}} a sister named Ura. Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for {{re-election}} as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this never happened. She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> a sister named Ura. The Kansas City Star even invented another sister, Hoosa.|$|E
500|$|Victoria Principal {{has said}} that she feels Pam changed {{throughout}} the course of the series. She commented, [...] "Pam didn’t have two parents, her father was a drunkard, and <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> to fight for everything she aspired to and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked about whether she had any input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t think any of us had much input. [...] You know the old saying, if it's not broken, don’t fix it; I really believe that Lorimar Television looked upon it as something that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula." ...|$|E
500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} and second unit director David Leitch {{compared it to}} a [...] "Jackie Chan hybrid of comedy and action." [...] Prior to the filming, Leitch organized a month-long boot camp in order to prepare Renner and Arterton (who said she was also glad that at least she could use her prior training that she received while studying at RADA) with extensive weapons, fight and stunt training. Janssen said she enjoyed [...] "flying", something that she always wanted to do, adding that despite her reputation as an action star {{it was the first}} film where <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> to do something physical (including suffering a minor accident on the set), because she could not use a double in the close-up scenes where she had the makeup on. During one of the scenes, where Gretel is thrown through a wall and falls down several meters, a stunt double for Arterton was dangerously injured when a nail got lodged in her skull close to the brain; Arterton said she initially wanted to do this stunt herself but Wirkola would not let her. Arterton herself suffered an injury when she sprained her ankle while running through the forest. Stunts for the more aggressive witches were done by New Zealander stuntwoman and actress Zoë Bell. Renner did practically all of his stunt scenes himself.|$|E

60|$|For my sake! Could <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> meant it, after all? I went {{to sleep}} {{thinking}} of that sentence, beside my client beneath the trees. And it was first in my thoughts when I awoke.|$|R
50|$|The voodoo {{queen of}} the group, {{no one is sure}} of what powers <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>has,</b> but <b>she</b> claims to have been born in the 18th century. Doyle and Houdini suspect she is {{actually}} a descendant of the original Marie Laveau.|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] was {{directed}} by the American photographer Herb Ritts, and shot at Key Biscayne in Miami, Florida {{in the last week}} of January 2001. Spears revealed she was inspired by Janet Jackson's video for [...] "Love Will Never Do (Without You)"(1990) to select Ritts as the video's director. According to Ritts, the singer [...] "wanted to do something fresh. There was one outfit, no dancing, and that meant that it boiled down to her. <b>She</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> to act the song, and she was very impressive." [...] He also revealed that the video was set at [...] "a funky beach shack" [...] similar to the videos for Madonna's [...] "Cherish" [...] (1989) and Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game" [...] (1989). [...] "The story is, pretty much, Britney longing for him to tell her the words", said Ritts, who was impressed with the chemistry between the singer and her fictional boyfriend, played by French model Brice Durand. Spears' real-life boyfriend at the time Justin Timberlake, however, [...] "was said to be miffed at Spears' kissing scenes with French model," [...] according to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV. Spears mother, Lynne, also criticized considered the original music video for being too racy at the time, because it contained sexually explicit material. Parts of the video were edited before its release to the public.|$|E
2500|$|Abrams {{supervised}} post-production {{and editing}} {{of the film}} at Bad Robot Productions' headquarters in Santa Monica. In August 2015, Abrams gave the estimated running time of the film as 124–125 minutes. Abrams made changes to the film's plot in the editing process to simplify the film, by removing some sequences shown in trailers: [...] "At one point, Maz used to continue along with the characters back to the Resistance base, but we realised that <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> nothing to do there of value, except to be sitting around." [...] The film was converted to 3D in post-production.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{wish there}} were any one to make {{inquiries}} about this person," [...] said Ermine; [...] "but when Colonel Keith came it was too late. I hoped she might consult him, but she {{has been so much}} absorbed that <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> never come in his way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah my friend!" [...] {{said the}} old man of the water, [...] "you could do little against the {{powerful}} Mahbracca and her minions. But you might go there to be sure, and find out if <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> possession of the Princess. But then you may lose your life." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, {{they all}} go," [...] said the minister's wife. [...] "Janet Moore and Miss Gray are our most {{enthusiastic}} members.

6000|$|... "Better now," [...] quoth Sir Leicester, motioning {{the lawyer}} {{to sit down}} and read to him alone. [...] "I have been quite alarmed. I never knew my Lady swoon before.

60|$|Her {{tone was}} anxious, {{and there was}} no doubt that <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> {{something}} to say which {{she did not want to}} write. He wondered what it could be, and started the same afternoon.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> {{no words}} of protest ready at hand, {{and it was}} long after queer old John Merrick had gone away that she remembered a dozen {{effective}} speeches {{that she might have}} delivered.|$|E

50|$|That evening, Teeter and Weck are together.

Upon returning home, Weck tries to sleep, but can't, and hears the arguments when Rex comes home.|$|R
5000|$|The Paters officially ordain Sabina as {{the newest}} Patti joining Argo and Juno in Saladin. However, {{most of the}} Paters are against the idea of {{appointing}} her.

60|$|Mr. Deyncourt {{was a tall}} fine-looking man, and did {{not begin}} by asking subscriptions, but talked about Northmoor, Constance, and Lady Adela, so that Ida found herself {{affecting}} much closer knowledge of both than <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>had.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She {{seemed to}} ask him with the last words whether <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> pleased him, as if {{something}} in his aspect suggested a doubt; and he hastened to reassure her. [...] "That was very good of you. I appreciate it highly. It's extremely gratifying." ...|$|E
60|$|And before Polly {{had time}} to reply he was gone. <b>She</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> never seen any one move across a room so quickly. But he always left an {{interesting}} trail behind: a piece of string knotted {{from end to end}} and a few photos.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked into}} {{her face as she}} spoke, and {{gradually}} began to perceive the working of her mind. He was so true to himself that he did not understand that there should be with her even that violet-coloured tinge of prevarication which women assume as an additional charm. Could <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> thought that he was attending to his own possible future interests when he warned her as to the making of new acquaintances? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say you're all wrong," [...] he yelled, {{starting}} for the corrals. [...] "She's only {{taking a}} little ride, same as she's done often. But rustle now. Find out. Dick, you ride cross the valley. Jim, you hunt {{up and down}} the river. I'll head up San Felipe way. And you, Laddy, take Diablo and hit the Casita trail. If <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>has</b> gone after Thorne you can catch her in an hour or so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I am {{pleasant}} to look upon. I cannot {{tell you how}} glad I am. It is so dreadful to believe one is ugly. You can get used to everything else, but you never get used to that. It hurts just the same every time you remember it. But why did mother tell me I was ugly? Could <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> thought so? Perhaps I have become better looking since I grew up." ...|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth was distressed. She {{felt that}} she had no {{business}} at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.

60|$|A {{few yards}} away, a wakeful Marjorie confronted a joyless universe. She had a {{baffling}} realization {{that her life}} was in a hopeless mess, that <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> behaved disgracefully, and that she couldn't for a moment understand how it had happened. She had intended to make quite sure of Trafford--and then put things straight.|$|E
6000|$|Matlack {{looked at}} her as she quietly walked away. [...] "She's a pretty sort of a hermit," [...] he said to himself. [...] "If <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> to live by herself she'd cut out a wooden man and talk to it all day. It won't be long before she accidentally stumbles over that big fellow with his book." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You think <b>she</b> <b>really</b> might <b>have</b> {{passed into}} some animal form?” asked Amanda. She {{was one of}} those who shape their {{opinions}} rather readily from the standpoint of those around them.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not answer}} her for a while, but lay still, with his eyes fixed upon her, as she sat with her elbow leaning on the window. Oh! what an unspeakable joy it was to him to hear such heavenly words spoken by her, whom he had almost worshipped; and yet her {{presence}} and her words turned his thoughts back from heaven to the earth which he had all but left. Could <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> loved him had it been his lot to survive these wars? Could <b>she</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> descended from her high pinnacle of state and fortune to bless so lowly a creature as him with her beauty and her excellence? As these thoughts passed through his brain, he began {{for the first time}} to long for life, to think that the promised blessings of heaven hardly compensated for those which he was forced to leave on earth; but his mind was under too strong control to be allowed to wander long upon such reflections. He soon recovered his wayward thoughts, and remembered that his one remaining earthly duty was to die.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But you do, and I'll {{take her}} on the {{strength}} of your judgment. Is <b>she</b> <b>really</b> handsome?--I <b>had</b> but the merest glance. But I know she is, or she wouldn't have caught your discriminating eye.' ...|$|R
