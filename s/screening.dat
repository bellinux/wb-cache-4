5|$|<b>Screening</b> among {{family members}} of people with known FH is cost-effective. Other {{strategies}} such as universal <b>screening</b> {{at the age of}} 16 were suggested in 2001. The latter approach may however be less cost-effective in the short term. <b>Screening</b> at an age lower than 16 was thought likely to lead to an unacceptably high rate of false positives.|$|E
5|$|<b>Screening</b> for aneurysms is not {{performed}} on a population level; {{because they are}} relatively rare, {{it would not be}} cost-effective. If someone has two or more first-degree relatives who have had an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, <b>screening</b> may be worthwhile.|$|E
5|$|<b>Screening</b> for {{hypothyroidism}} {{is performed}} in the newborn period in many countries, generally using TSH. This {{has led to the}} early identification of many cases and thus the prevention of developmental delay. It is the most widely used newborn <b>screening</b> test worldwide. While TSH-based <b>screening</b> will identify the most common causes, the addition of T4 testing is required to pick up the rarer central causes of neonatal hypothyroidism. If T4 determination is included in the <b>screening</b> done at birth, this will identify cases of congenital hypothyroidism of central origin in 1:16,000 to 1:160,000 children. Considering that these children usually have other pituitary hormone deficiencies, early identification of these cases may prevent complications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Screens</b> come in many forms. A <b>screen</b> to {{a running}} back to either the strong or short {{side of the field}} in the flats is often just called a <b>screen.</b> <b>Screens</b> to wide {{receivers}} come in four forms: the bubble <b>screen,</b> middle <b>screen,</b> slot <b>screen,</b> and slip <b>screen.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{differs from}} the Second <b>screen</b> configuration.

5|$|<b>Screening</b> of {{toddlers}} {{has been}} suggested, and {{results of a}} trial on 10,000 one-year-olds were published in 2016. Work was needed to find whether <b>screening</b> was cost-effective, and acceptable to families.|$|E
5|$|The Brick Lane <b>screening</b> – on 8 December 1995 – {{had been}} previewed in NME, and was chaotically busy. It was {{originally}} planned {{for a car}} park, but freezing conditions and snow forced a rethink and the <b>screening</b> was moved indoors, to {{the basement of the}} nearby Seven Stars pub. Hundreds of people crammed in to watch the <b>screening,</b> which was eventually abandoned partway through due to the cramped conditions. The NME preview had claimed that after the <b>screening</b> the film would be cut up and individual frames sold off to the public. Gimpo, the owner of the film, had no intention of doing so, but after the <b>screening</b> was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of people wanting to take home a piece of the film.|$|E

50|$|Fixed-frame <b>screens</b> {{provide the}} {{greatest}} level of uniform {{tension on the}} <b>screens</b> surface, resulting in the optimal image quality. They are often used in home theater and professional environments where the <b>screen</b> {{does not need to}} be recessed into the case. Electric <b>screens</b> can be wall mounted, ceiling mounted or ceiling recessed. These are often larger <b>screens,</b> though electric <b>screens</b> are available for home theater use as well. Electric <b>screens</b> are similar to pull-down <b>screens,</b> but instead of the <b>screen</b> being pulled down manually, an electric motor raises and lowers the <b>screen.</b> Electric <b>screens</b> are usually raised or lowered using either a remote control or wall-mounted switch, although some projectors are equipped with an interface that connects to the <b>screen</b> and automatically lowers the <b>screen</b> when the projector is switched on and raises it when the projector is switched off.|$|R

40|$|The {{plug flow}} and mixed flow methods of {{modelling}} a <b>screen</b> are analysed {{in terms of}} <b>screen</b> length, internal fibre concentration and <b>screen</b> separation performance. Experimental data for consistency changes in <b>screens</b> of narrow length are incorporated into the analysis and from this data an equation for determining the real thickening in the <b>screen</b> and the fibre concentration profile along the <b>screen</b> is derived. Lastly, thicken equations are related to common equations used for modelling overall <b>screen</b> performance. The work directly links <b>screen</b> performance equations to passage ratio measurements from narrow length <b>screen</b> sections...|$|R
5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test.

5|$|Between April 2008 and the film's {{commercial}} {{release in}} August 2008, the film had over 250 promotional screenings.

The <b>screening</b> was {{on behalf of the}} United Service Organizations and included the actors heading to the <b>screening</b> by helicopter and Humvees. On August 8, 2008, a special 30-minute fictional E! True Hollywood Story aired about the making of Tropic Thunder.

5|$|Blood {{transfusion}} {{was formerly}} the second-most common {{mode of transmission}} for Chagas disease, but {{the development and implementation}} of blood bank <b>screening</b> tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the 21st century. Blood donations in all endemic Latin American countries undergo Chagas <b>screening,</b> and testing is expanding in countries, such as France, Spain and the United States, that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas. In Spain, donors are evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for <b>screening</b> tests.|$|E
50|$|In Turkey, <b>screen</b> graphics, bugs, or DOGs {{are known}} as <b>screen</b> badges. On analogue/digital television, <b>screen</b> badges were {{introduced}} to One on January 1, 2000.

5|$|CT <b>screening</b> is {{associated}} with a high rate of falsely positive tests which may result in unneeded treatment. For each true positive scan there are about 19 falsely positives scans. Other concerns include radiation exposure and the cost of testing along with follow up.

5|$|Cancer <b>screening</b> uses {{medical tests}} to detect disease in {{large groups of}} people who have no symptoms. For {{individuals}} with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) <b>screening</b> can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to {{it in a way that}} prolongs life. This form of <b>screening</b> reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%).
