5000|$|The breakfast taco, {{found in}} Tex-Mex cuisine, is a <b>soft</b> <b>corn</b> or flour tortilla filled with meat, eggs, or cheese, {{and can also}} contain other ingredients. Some have claimed that Austin, Texas {{is the home of}} the breakfast taco. However, food writer and OC Weekly editor Gustavo Arellano responded that such a {{statement}} reflects a common trend of [...] "whitewashed" [...] foodways reporting, noting that predominantly Hispanic San Antonio, Texas [...] "never had to brag about its breakfast taco love—folks there just call it 'breakfast'.|$|E
50|$|The {{location}} of <b>soft</b> <b>corns</b> tends to differ {{from that of}} hard corns. Hard corns occur on dry, flat surfaces of skin. <b>Soft</b> <b>corns</b> (frequently found between adjacent toes) stay moist, keeping the surrounding skin soft.

40|$|As we {{observed}} {{a few weeks}} ago, the 2008 corn crop is wetter and lower in test weight than average corn. Long, cool growing seasons produce high yields but the corn is wet and soft, with more soft white starch. This means lower test weight, and reduced storability as mold can invade the softer textured kernels more rapidly. It also takes more energy to remove water from <b>softer</b> <b>corn...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{conditions}} {{occurring in}} the dancer's forefoot {{can be divided into}} five categories. The three categories pre-sented in Part I of our study include those conditions occurring from poor training, those from chronic forefoot stresses, and those of static deformity. Five hundred dancers were observed for both symptomatic and asymp-tomatic forefoot conditions. It is most important that a young dancer have at least three years training before dancing en pointe. Many skeletal changes in a dancer's foot occur from use and should not be interpreted as injuries. Static forefoot deformities tend to appear in dancers at a younger age than the general population but seldom require corrective surgery. Dancers who perform classical ballet, modern, or ethnic dance, develop characteristics which constitute several conditions of the feet. 10. 11 They also have problems specific to the category of dance that they perform. These problems are related to the unusual stresses and positions which the discipline of the art requires in order to create the effect of characterizing movement. " In this article the authors present three categories of conditions in the forefoot some of which are "normal " and others of which are considered "disease " states. The skin of the foot is modified in the dancer through use as it comes in contact with the floor and with the constricting and restraining ballet pointe shoe, ballet shoe, and character shoe. A description of these changes is present. Superficial skin problems includ-ing characteristic corns and callouses over points of contact are shown. Disease states such as <b>soft</b> <b>corns</b> blisters, dissecting abscesses, and tears along the skin creases are presented. Conditions resulting from poor training are also presented...|$|R

40|$|In a <b>soft</b> <b>corn</b> {{year the}} most {{profitable}} use of the crop offers a serious problem, {{but there is a}} way out of it where-ever the corn can be fed to livestock. It may be fed immediately, as feeders know, for no harmful results need be feared in feeding it intelligently if it has not been allowed to spoil. But it may also be ensiled for later feeding, or dried by natural or artificial heat and stored in cribs. In either case the feed resulting will give the farmer the best possible returns for his damaged crop, altho the ensiled corn will cost less per 100 pounds as feed than the dried corn. These facts are shown by the experiments reported in this bulletin. In years prior to these experiments, the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station successfully ensiled <b>soft</b> <b>corn</b> ears, securing apparently good silage...|$|E

40|$|Futures prices when {{combined}} with a basis forecast provide a reliable way to forecast cash prices. The most popular method of forecasting basis is historical moving averages. Given the recent failure of longer moving averages proposed by previous studies, this research reassesses past recommendations about the best length of moving average to use in forecasting basis. This research compares practical preharvest and storage period basis forecasts for hard wheat, <b>soft</b> wheat, <b>corn</b> and soybeans to identify the optimal amount of historical information to include in moving average forecasts. Only with preharvest hard wheat forecasts are the best moving averages longer than 3 years. The differences in forecast accuracy among the different moving averages are small {{and in most cases}} the differences are not statistically significant. The recommendation is to use longer moving averages during time periods (or at locations) when there have been no structural changes and use last year’s basis after it appears that a structural change has occurred.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Corn {{cultivated}} in Brazil is predominantly of hard texture, and more propense to decreased starch digestibility under late harvesting situations than dent hybrids. This work tested {{the utilization of}} dent corn {{as a way of}} extending the ensilage period without reducing animal performance, and evaluated the potential of sugarcane as a forage for high-producing dairy cows. Nine lactating Holstein cows were allocated to three 3 × 3 latin squares and were fed 200 g of forage neutral detergent fiber per kg of dry matter as either hard texture corn ensiled at the half milk line stage of maturity, <b>soft</b> texture <b>corn</b> ensiled at the black layer stage, or sugarcane. There were no detectable differences between corn hybrids with regard to milk yield (34. 2 vs 34. 6 kg d- 1) and composition, dry matter intake (23. 0 vs 23. 2 kg d- 1) and total tract apparent digestibility of nutrients. Sugarcane decreased feed intake (21. 5 kg d- 1) and milk yield (31. 9 kg d- 1). Organic matter digestibility, chewing activity and rumen pH did not differ among treatments. Sugarcane seems to be a viable option to feed groups of Holstein cows during lactation stages in which nutrient demand is not at a maximum. The performance of dairy cows fed dent corn ensiled at the black layer stage of maturity was similar to the performance of cows fed flint corn ensiled at the half milk line stage...|$|R
40|$|Kernels {{from a pair}} of {{isogenic}} lines (with {{regard to}} hardness) and two commercial hybrids of dent corn (that varied in hardness) were ground on the Stenvert Hardness Tester and separated by sieving into coarse (3 ̆e 0. 710 mm) and fine (3 ̆c 0. 500 mm) fractions. The corn samples differed little in oil contents. The coarse particles from the hard corn samples were angular and sharp-edged; those from the <b>soft</b> <b>corn</b> samples were rounded. The yield of coarse particles was higher and they contained less oil in hard than in <b>soft</b> <b>corn.</b> Fine particles from all four corn samples had higher oil content than the coarse particles. Visual examination, observation at low magnification under a light microscope, and use of a scanning electron microscope revealed consistent differences in the extent and mode of corn kernel breakdown during grinding. Particles in the coarse fraction from hard kernels were to a large extent intact with little exposure of their contents. In the soft kernels, particles in the coarse fraction were broken extensively and their contents exposed. It is postulated that differences in the extent of mechanical breakdown and oil content are related to differences in shelf life of corn grits...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a contextual {{examination of}} an ethical organizational dilemma complicated by elaborate and interrelated systems or <b>soft</b> technologies. Dow <b>Corning</b> 2 ̆ 7 s silicone breast implant case is analyzed by example, {{to show the}} usefulness of a more varied, flexible, and multi-faceted approach to ethics and management {{in the midst of}} a rapidly expanding technological society. This case represents an ongoing managerial crisis that demonstrates why integrated ethical analysis is not a theoretical or historical practice but one of vital and critical social importance. ^ Through qualitative analysis, this study addresses an ethical and managerial crisis from three broad perspectives of ethics, technology, and organizations. The ethical analysis is based on the three constructs of rule ethics, consequence ethics, and virtue ethics. The systems technologies reviewed are the medical system, the legal system, the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the media, and the consumer groups. Finally, as this research provides insights for practical and ethical management, an organizational analysis is included that views corporations as machines, systems, and cultures. ^ The multi-faceted organizational and ethical assessment used in this study enhances the creative and disciplined thought required in today 2 ̆ 7 s generally complex, ambiguous, and paradoxical business environment. The Dow Coming silicone implant case demonstrates how systems technologies in an insular rules-based culture caused a corporation reputed for high ethical principles to suffer bankruptcy for alleged unethical and illegal conduct. An organizational culture based predominantly on rules and consequences requires decision-makers with broad perspectives on moral character and virtue. Managers need broader ways of understanding organizational life to better prepare a corporation for both ethical and financial success in today 2 ̆ 7 s rapidly changing technological society. A holistic perspective provides extensions of ethical understanding and development, opportunities to ensure stakeholder rights, and increased probabilities for organizational survival and growth. ...|$|R
40|$|Shrimp needs a {{high protein}} of feed {{to get a}} maximum growth. Generally, the optimal growth of shrimp will be reached when protein content up to 40 ??? 50 %. But in other side, when the protein {{substance}} in a feed is too high, it may decrease the water quality of cultivation media. One of ways {{that can be done}} is minimize a feed protein content and change it with carbohydrates in high protein so that, the energy from protein sources can be used to maximize a growth but the energy just for metabolism and the activity is gotten from carbohrydrates. It is needed to know the production of potential area for providing carbohydrate material source of shrimp feed in South Sulawesi. Based on the research result, there are five regencies which the highest producer of carbohydrates that takes from paddy field, paddy of unirrigated field, sweet potato, and cassava.
