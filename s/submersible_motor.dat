The bearing consists of a Leaded bronze material (Bronze grade LTB 2, 3 or 4 of IS 318 or Nitrile / cutless rubber) which is the softer part out these two. The failures of the bearing bush accounts for 90 % of the failures in a <b>submersible</b> <b>motor.</b> The implication of this failure is the complete breakdown of the Motor i. e. the windings will get damaged and expensive repairs would be required to be carried out. This clearly suggests that the design of such a journal should be properly investigated. A CFD approach would assist in establishing the dimension (length) of the bearing. This paper presents step by step application of CFD to optimize the bearing length and is an outcome of around 3 years of extensive research in an attempt to solve a manufacturer’s long standing problem.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} delta modulated inverters and their applications to submersible motors. Submersible motors are induction motors with unique constructional features. These motors are required to operate {{in one of the}} most harsh environmental conditions. The operating characteristics of the <b>submersible</b> <b>motor</b> pump system require soft starting facility and variable speed operation during production. To satisfy both requirements, a delta modulated inverter supply is proposed for the operation of the <b>submersible</b> <b>motor.</b> Several delta modular schemes have been studied and the rectangular wave delta modulation technique is selected for the switching of the inverter. Rectangular wave delta modulation provides inherent constant voltage/frequency (V/f) characteristic of the supply voltage and current control of the motor. The constant V/f characteristic is provided by the low-pass filter in the feedback loop of the modulator and the current control is provided by the hysteresis window of the quantizing comparator in the feedforward path of the modulator. [...] The modulator and the inverter waveform were studied using discrete Fourier transform (DFT). This is simpler than the conventional Fourier series analysis. It is suitable for on-line harmonic analysis of the modulated waveforms. It also gives the information about the sub-harmonics of the modulated waveforms. An on-line harmonic minimization technique using a tuned filter in the delta modulator has been implemented. This method uses the continuous tuning of the feedback filter in the modulator to minimize the low order harmonics of the modulated wave for variable frequency operation of the inverter. [...] The steady state and starting characteristics of the <b>submersible</b> <b>motor</b> supplied from the rectangular wave delta modulated inverter have been studied using time-domain analysis. Time domain analysis of inverter-fed submersible motors was found to be more accurate and easier than the conventional frequency domain analysis. The motor was provided with ramp frequency and voltage (RFV) control to reduce its electrical and mechanical starting stresses. A semi-closed loop operation has been chosen to maintain constant slip operation of the motor. For the semi-closed loop operation, motor speed was estimated using the motor terminal voltage, current and the phase angle between them. [...] The characteristics of the modulator and the motor fed from the rectangular wave delta modulated inverter were experimentally verified...|$|E

This project contains a defect free <b>submersible</b> <b>motor</b> pump which provides better strength to the motor body. It also covers a family mold for 3 components namely Top cover, Bottom cover and Bottom pad which reduces {{the cost of}} molding by 50 % as one mould full fills the requirement of 3 molds and minimized defects. This project reduced the fill time of components without any increment in defects. It also designs and analyzed the Bottom pad {{which is going to}} resist the loads of motor body in Ansys 13. 0 to determine the various stresses, strain and fatigue life of the material. The software has helped us really to achieve our goal regarding calculating the “total deformation and fatigue life of bottom pad”. As the whole analysis was done by the means of software, therefore results and observations were trustworthy and meet with our expectations. Reduced fill time of every component does not affect the properties of the final component. This project has chosen the 3 D mesh and surface mesh for the Central body and Top cover, Bottom cover and Bottom pad respectively. These meshes produced better results and also help us to minimize the defects. The family mold thus formed ultimately helps us to reduce the overall cost of the component and hence this project successfully got its goals...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} small {{diameter}} pump system capable of being deployed through existing production tubing strings in oil/gas wells. The pump system would then pump water up an inner tubing string (likely coil tubing) and allow gas to flow in the annulus between the coil tubing and production tubing. Accomplishing this would allow wells that are currently loaded up (unable to flow at high enough rates to lift the fluid out of the wellbore) to continue to produce additional gas/oil reserves. The project was unable to complete a working test system due to unforeseen complexities in coupling the system components together in part due to the small diameter. Although several of the individual components were sourced and secured, coupling them together and getting electricity to the motor proved technically more difficult than expected. Thus, the project is no longer active due primarily to the complications realized in coupling the components and the difficulties in getting electricity to the <b>submersible</b> <b>motor</b> in a slimhole system. The other problem in finishing this project was the lack of financial resources. When the grant was first applied for it was expected that it would be awarded in early 2004. Since the grant was not actually awarded until the end of August 2004, GPS had basically run out of $$$ and the principle developer (Steve Bodden) had to find a full time job which began in late July 2004. When the grant was finally awarded in late August, it was still hoped that the project could proceed as a part time development but with less financial exposure to the partners in GPS. This became very problematic as it still had many technical obstacles to overcome to get it to the stage of prototype testing...|$|E
