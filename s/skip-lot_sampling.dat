40|$|<b>Skip-lot</b> <b>sampling</b> plan {{serves as}} a {{cost-effective}} technique to manage the cost of performing frequent product inspections. As a powerful tool within a real-time quality management system, the ability to collect data which an optimize <b>skip-lot</b> <b>sampling</b> parameters affords manufacturers the luxury of lowering inspection expenses in various manufacturing units. The good quality of product can be produced in continuous improvement of production process in excellent quality history for suppliers. The procedures and necessary tables are provided for finding the respective plans for which sum of producer and consumer risks are minimized with acceptable and limiting quality levels which accounts for the prior distribution of process state for each lot and revenue received appreciably which reduces destructive testing...|$|E

40|$|In {{this project}} we examine {{different}} sampling plans {{as part of}} reliability control procedures in manufacturing. The systematic sampling conventionally used by many companies can {{be replaced by a}} <b>skip-lot</b> <b>sampling</b> plan which provides the same level of protection against defectiveproducts while requiring fewer resources. In this project we investigate <b>skip-lot</b> <b>sampling</b> procedure and its statistical properties. We will also compare the medium rank regression method of fitting Weibull distribution parameters with the maximum likelihood method. Finally, we conduct a simulation study to empirically investigate the performance of the proposed method and its properties. In contrast to the existing literature on this topic, this project considers a wider range of reliability sampling procedures and makes extensive use of simulation methods...|$|E

The plan {{parameters of the}} pro-posed plan are determined through a nonlinear optimization problem by minimizing the average sample number satisfying both the producer’s risk and the consumer’s risks.

The parameters of the plan are determined when two points on the operating characteristic curve are specified, the two points being (p 1,) and (p 2,), where p 1 is the acceptable quality level, is the producer's risk, p 2 is the limiting quality level and is the consumer's risk. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design for <b>skip-lot</b> <b>sampling</b> inspection plans with the double-sampling plan as the reference plan, {{so as to}} reduce the sample size and produce more efficient plans {{in return for the}} same sampling effort. The efficiency of the proposed plan compared with that of the conventional double-sampling plan is also discussed. The need for smaller acceptance numbers under the plan is highlighted. Methods of selecting the plan indexed by the acceptable quality level and limiting quality level, and by the acceptable quality level and average outgoing quality level are also presented. ...|$|E
40|$|Currently, several state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) {{are using}} {{contractor}} test results, {{in conjunction with}} verification test results, for construction and materials acceptance purposes. While the reasons for using contractor test results for construction and materials acceptance purposes are real (essentially shortage of state DOT staff and intensive construction schedules), the practice itself has fundamental pitfalls. This research reveals the conceptual and technical pitfalls of using contractor test results for acceptance and payment purposes; identifies and ranks potential alternatives and improvements {{to the use of}} contractor test results for acceptance and payment purposes; and investigates the potential application of <b>skip-lot</b> <b>sampling</b> as a means for reducing acceptance sampling and testing for highway agencies...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>Skip-lot</b> <b>sampling</b> {{is to reduce}} the Average Sample Number (ASN) and Average Total Inspection (ATI) as well as {{inspection}} costs. The Skip-lot concept is economically advantageous to make decision on the submitted lot. This paper presents the comparison of skip lot sampling plan SkSP- 2 and SkSP-V in terms of Probability Accepting, (Pa), Average Outgoing Quality (AOQ), ASN, ATI and also cost reduction. The results indicated that SkSP- 2 and SkSP-V were not significant different on the Pa and AOQ. However, SkSP-V gave lowest cost significantly both from ASN and ATI. This property shows the advantage of SkSP-V for the lowest cost inspection but SkSP- 2 for easier implementation because of the smaller parameters in actual operation...|$|E
