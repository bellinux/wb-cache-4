5|$|As Pozdniakov readily admits, his {{analysis}} is highly {{sensitive to the}} accuracy of the glyph inventory. <b>Since</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not published the details of how he established this inventory, it is not possible for others to verify his work.|$|E

5|$|Sheldon {{decides to}} set up his own Comic-Con, and tries to {{convince}} several celebrities to appear, including Stan Lee, Bill Nye the Science Guy, Leonard Nimoy, and Wil Wheaton. <b>Since</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> restraining orders from Lee, Nimoy, and Nye, he asks Leonard to contact them. He then discovers James Earl Jones, whom he reveres for voicing the Star Wars villain Darth Vader, {{and is going to}} a sushi restaurant, where Sheldon meets him.|$|E

60|$|After Miss Strong {{had gone}} below that night Tarzan stood {{leaning over the}} rail looking far out to sea. Every night <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done this <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> come on board--sometimes he stood thus for an hour.

5|$|Archer {{requests}} {{the coordinates}} of Xindus, the Xindi homeworld, from Kessick. But the alien refuses to help unless Archer helps him escape. Archer declines, {{but he soon}} learns that the foreman had ulterior motives, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> ordered three warships to overpower Enterprise and enslave his crew. Kessick claims {{to know how to}} escape the mine, but asks for Archer's help in return for guiding the Starfleet officers. Archer reluctantly agrees, and Kessick leads him and Tucker through the mine's sewage removal system. However, the group is soon detected in a conduit, and the foreman floods the system with plasma in an effort to kill them. They narrowly escape being killed, but quickly {{fall into the hands of}} the mine's security forces.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Milhouse visit a joke shop. Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa plan {{a trip to}} the Springsonian Museum so {{they can}} see the Egyptian Treasures of Isis exhibit and the Orb of Isis. Marge has to take Bart to a doctor instead, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> superglued various novelty items to his face. Since this is Lisa's last chance to see the exhibit, she phones Homer to ask him if she can take the bus. He seems uncertain, which prompts her to trick him into letting her take the bus.|$|E

Additionally, Hickenbottom moved around frequently since his father was in the military.|$|E

5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) and Ron (Nick Offerman) head up to Indianapolis {{to receive}} a {{commendation}} at the Indiana Statehouse for reestablishing the Pawnee Harvest Festival, although Ron is only interested in eating at Charles Mulligan's Steak House, his favorite restaurant. Ann (Rashida Jones) tells Leslie her last talk with Chris (Rob Lowe) reassured her their relationship was fine, {{but he has been}} acting distant since then. She asks Leslie to look for signs of whether Chris is cheating on her, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> since returned to Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{prepares for}} an acting {{job in a}} {{laboratory}} safety video that was arranged by his talent agent, Carla Fern (Roseanne Barr). The directors continuously have {{to talk him out}} of overacting, and he backs down from shooting a scene using an eye wash, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> an aversion towards anything being shot into his eye. However, Carla threatens to have him blacklisted if he does not go through with the scene. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who came along as friendly support, gives Andy the confidence to shoot the scene, and in the end Andy even insists on doing two takes.|$|E

Seaver passed Koufax's record in 1974 when he ended the season with more than 2,000 NL innings and an ERA of 2.47.

60|$|In {{the first}} place his stomach had not been really filled for a long time. Food had been scarce, and while Reddy had always {{obtained}} enough to keep from starving, {{it was a long}} time <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> had a really good meal. <b>He</b> <b>had,</b> you remember, traveled a very long distance to catch that fat hen, and it had been many hours <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> had a bite of anything. There is nothing like a good appetite to make things taste good. Reddy certainly had the appetite to make that fat hen the finest dinner a Fox ever ate.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 2006 season, Kirkland {{petitioned the}} NCAA for an {{additional}} year of eligibility to compete in four years of football, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> only played in three-of-five <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> redshirt his freshman year, and an injury redshirt two years later.

5|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{difference in}} the storyline takes place when Zhou travels with his teenage disciples to visit his friend the Abbot. Instead of Yue wandering behind the temple to battle the magical snake, he stays with Zhou and the Abbot, while the other disciples go off to explore. Zhou watches as the Abbot tests Yue's strength by asking him to move an ornate three-hundred pound copper stove dating from the Han Dynasty. The abbot then lifts a stone floor tile and presents the boy with a large book on military strategy. He goes on to tell Yue how he was once a great soldier who fought in campaigns against the Liao and Western Xia empires, but became a monk after the Song agreed to become a vassal of each state. He later {{made a name for}} himself by teaching military skills to youths from the surrounding area. <b>Since</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> no heir of his own, the Abbot presents Yue with his own personal spear and instructs him in the proper use of the weapon. Zhou kindly protests the gift at first, but allows Yue to keep it out of friendship.|$|E
5|$|Erling Folkvord (born 15 June 1949) is a Norwegian {{politician}} for the Red party, and {{a former}} member of the Parliament of Norway. A revolutionary socialist, he was one of the leading members of the Workers' Communist Party and the Red Electoral Alliance before they merged to form Red. He sat as a member of the Parliament of Norway from 1993 to 1997, becoming the first socialist to the left of the Socialist Left Party and the Labour Party in parliament since 1961. He later lost his position in 1997, and has been a candidate for parliament ever <b>since.</b> <b>He</b> <b>has</b> been a member of the Oslo City Council from 1983 to 1993, and again since 1999. Folkvord has become one of the best-known Norwegian politicians on the left who is not connected with the Labour Party and the Socialist Left Party.|$|E
5|$|In Novi, Virginia, a {{group of}} ex-convicts, led by Dr. Lisa Holland (Katy Boyer), meet and discuss atoning for their sins. Terry Pruit (Don Swayze) tells the others that, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{discovered}} the group, he has made amends for his past. However, another member, Ed (Cyril O'Reilly), tells him that humans are unable to change {{and that they are}} both destined for hell. Ed's friend, Victor Potts (David Figlioli), tells Holland that he's been having nightmares involving people being skinned alive. That night, he has a vision of Ed skinned. Several hours later, Victor is murdered. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) asks John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to examine Potts' body. Reyes explains that, because Potts had a premonition of his death, the case is an X-File. Meanwhile, at a butchery, Terry and Ed get into an argument. Terry later has a vision—similar to Victor's—in which Ed is skinned alive. That night, he is attacked and brutally flayed.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Rakesh tells Raj about {{a defect}} in the company's new mobile handset: a call goes to two people simultaneously—the {{intended}} recipient and another random person on the phone's contact list. Raj needs Sonia's permission to stop production, and she invites him to her house to discuss the matter. Sonia makes provocative and sexually explicit statements to Raj, who ignores her. She then aggressively tries to pursue Raj, who resists. Although he repeatedly rejects her advances, Sonia continues trying to seduce him. As he leaves, Sonia threatens to punish him for spurning her. The next day, he learns that Sonia has told her husband that he sexually harassed her. <b>Since</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> admitted finding Sonia attractive, his claim of innocence is not believed, and the company pressures him into resignation.|$|E
25|$|On 3 February it was {{announced}} that Waters would also play in Denver, Colorado, on 30 April, almost eight years since he last played there, on 3 July 2000, during the In The Flesh tour.

On 20 February, another European date {{was announced}}, this time in Granada, Spain, 9 May.|$|E
25|$|Usually, the bowler {{decides what}} type of {{delivery}} to bowl next, without consultation or even informing any other member of his team. Sometimes, the team captain will offer advice or even issue a direct order regarding what deliveries to bowl, based on his observations of the batsman and the strategic state of the game. Another player who occasionally offers advice to the bowler is the wicket-keeper, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a unique view of the batsman and {{may be able to}} spot weaknesses of technique.|$|E

25|$|Secret commissions, or bribes, {{also come}} under the no profit rule. The bribe shall be held in {{constructive}} trust for the principal. The person who made the bribe cannot recover it, <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> committed a crime. Similarly, the fiduciary, who received the bribe, has committed a crime. Fiduciary duties are an aspect of equity and, {{in accordance with the}} equitable principles, or maxims, equity serves those with clean hands. Therefore, the bribe is held on constructive trust for the principal, the only innocent party.|$|E
25|$|After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, he {{returned}} to Romania, where {{he was involved in}} handing out emergency humanitarian aid from the West. Ever <b>since,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> commuted between Paris and Bucharest, and has played a part in promoting Romanian literature to the foreign public. His diaries from the early 1970s, detailing the years of his dissidence, were published in Romania beginning in 2006.

25|$|The {{action is}} {{confined}} to a derelict street corner where everything is in ruins. The day is wintry, grey and sunless. A blind beggar (A), sitting on a folding-stool, is scraping away on his fiddle {{in the hope of}} getting a few coins from any passers-by. Three times in his opening speech he emphasises that he is “a poor old man.” His bowl is quite empty though; it has been some time <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> had contact with anyone. This day however a wheelchair-using man (B) is drawn to his playing. He is similarly disabled having lost one leg (“It went bad and was removed”).|$|E
50|$|It {{emerged in}} the {{litigation}} that Mutua had not been shortlisted <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not obtained a tax clearance from the Kenya Revenue Authority <b>since</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> reportedly not met his tax obligations in Kenya.
