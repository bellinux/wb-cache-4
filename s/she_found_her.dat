5|$|At {{the age of}} 14, O'Hara {{joined the}} Abbey Theatre. Though she was mentored by playwright Lennox Robinson, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> time at the theatre disappointing.

She later put her skills to use when she typed the script of The Quiet Man for John Ford.|$|E
5|$|Oberlin’s {{compensation}} policies required Stone to do {{twice the}} labor a male student {{had to do}} to pay the same costs. Stone frequently rose at two o'clock to fit in work and study, and <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> health declining. In February 1845, having decided to submit to the injustice no longer, she asked the Faculty Board for the same pay given two lesser-experienced male colleagues. When her request was denied, she resigned her position. Pleading with the faculty to restore Stone, her former students said they would pay Stone “what was right” if the college would not. Stone had planned to borrow money from her father when funds ran out, but Francis Stone, moved by his daughter’s description of her struggles, promised to provide money when needed. Help from home was not needed, however, because after three months of pressure, the faculty yielded and hired Stone back, paying both her and other women student teachers at the same rate paid male student teachers.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, Aspasia {{decided not}} to go back to Greece and she {{returned}} to Venice, to live once more on the Island of Giudecca.

Still without sufficient financial resources and concerned about the situation of her daughter (who granted her at one point the guardianship of her grandson Crown Prince Alexander,), Aspasia led a quiet life, punctuated by a few public appearances during cultural events. Over the years, her financial situation deteriorated even further, and during the winter of 1959–1960, the Princess was no longer able to pay the heating bills. She temporarily left the Garden of Eden and stayed in the hotels Europa and Britannia in Venice. Shortly after, she was forced to sell some furniture and other valuables to pay off her debts.|$|E

Having been conditioned to the promiscuous social norms of the World State, Linda finds herself at once popular with every man in the pueblo (because she is open to all sexual advances) and also reviled for the same reason, seen as a whore by the wives of the men who visit her and by the men themselves (who come to her nonetheless). Linda is desperate to return to the World State and to soma, wanting nothing more from her remaining life than comfort until death.|$|E

25|$|Coleman and Brown bicycled into Norwood on July 13 {{at about}} 9:30a.m. Less {{than three hours}} later, they drove away in a car {{belonging}} to Harry Walters, who was unconscious, and his wife, Marlene, 43, who had been raped and beaten to death. Harry Walters survived and later testified that Coleman and Brown inquired about a camper he had offered for sale. While Walters {{sat on the couch}} and discussed the trailer title with Coleman, Coleman picked up a wooden candlestick and, after admiring it, hit Walters {{on the back of the}} head with it. The impact of the blow broke the candlestick and drove a chunk of bone against Mr. Walters' brain, and he remembered little else of the incident beyond that point. Sheri Walters, Harry and Marlene's daughter, returned home from work at about 3:45p.m., where <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> mother dead at the bottom of the basement steps, and her father still alive. Both had ligatures around their throats and electrical cords tied around their bare feet, her father's hands were handcuffed behind his back, while her mother's hands were bound behind her back and her head was covered with a bloody sheet. The coroner indicated Marlene Walters had been bludgeoned on the head approximately 20 to 25 times, with twelve lacerations, some of which were made with a pair of locking pliers, covered her face and scalp. The back of her skull was crushed to pieces, and parts of her skull and brain were missing. The living room hallway and basement were splattered with blood, and shards of a broken soda bottle, bearing Coleman's fingerprints, were found in the living room. Strands of Marlene Walters' hair were found on a bloodstained magazine rack located in the living room, and bloody footprints made by two different kinds of shoes were found in the basement. The Walters' car, a red Plymouth Reliant, was missing, as well as money, jewelry, and shoes which had been stolen. Two bicycles, clothes and shoes not belonging to the Walters had been left behind.|$|E
