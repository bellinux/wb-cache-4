40|$|Controlled source <b>seismic</b> <b>investigation</b> of crustal {{structure}} below ice covers is {{an emerging}} technique. We have recently conducted an explosive refraction/wide-angle reflection seismic experiment {{on the ice}} cap in east-central Greenland. The data-quality is high for all shot points and a full crustal model can be modelled. A crucial challenge for applying the technique is to control the sources. Here, we present data that describe the efficiency of explosive sources in the ice cover. Analysis of the data shows, that the ice cap traps {{a significant amount of}} energy, which is observed as a strong ice wave. The ice cap leads to low transmission of energy into the crust such that charges need be larger than in conventional onshore experiments to obtain reliable seismic signals. The strong reflection coefficient {{at the base of the}} ice generates strong multiples which may mask for secondary phases. This effect may be crucial for acquisition of reflection seismic profiles on ice caps. Our experience shows that it is essential to use optimum depth for the charges and to seal the boreholes carefully. 氷の下の地殻構造を調べるための制御震源による地震探査技術は成熟している。最近、東部-中央グリーンランド氷床上で、発破震源を用いた屈折法・広角反射法地震探査を行った。全ての発破点の取得データは高品質であり、地殻全体の地震波モデルが求められた。この技術を応用する際の重要な課題は、震源の制御である。本論文では氷床上での爆破震源の効果に関するデータを示す。氷床は非常に大きなエネルギーをトラップし、強いice waveとして観測される。また氷床から地殻に透過するエネルギーは小さく、信頼できる地震信号を得るためには、通常の陸上での探査よりも大きな爆薬量を要する。氷床下の基盤では反射係数が大きく、強い多重反射波を生成して後続波を隠してしまう。この効果は、氷床上での地震反射測線でのデータ収録に大きく影響する。我々の実験からは、爆薬の適切な深度の確定、及び発破坑を丁寧に塞ぐことが必須と言える...|$|E

The first <b>seismic</b> <b>investigation</b> around Lembang fault {{has been done by}} deploying a seismic network from May 2010 till December 2011 to estimate the seismic activities around that fault. Nine events were recorded and distributed around the fault. Seven events were likely to be generated by the Lembang fault and two events were not. The events related to the Lembang fault strongly suggest that this fault has left-lateral kinematic. It shows vector movement of Australian plate toward NNE might have been responsible for the Lembang fault kinematic following its initial vertical gravitational movement. The 1 -D velocity model obtained from inversion indicates the stratigraphy configuration around the fault composed at least three layers of low Vp/Vs at the top, high Vp/Vs at the middle layer and moderate Vp/Vs at the bottom. In comparison with general geology of the area, top, mid and bottom layers may consecutively represent Quaternary volcanic layer, pre-Quaternary water-filled sedimentary layer and pre-Quaternary basement.
