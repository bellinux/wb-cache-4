I worked {{for a company that}} did the parts catalog for Boeing airliners. These were the books that the mechanics kept in the hangars so that they could order the parts.

I kind of enjoyed it. It was different. After that I went to work as a package designer for a manufacturer of paper boxes. I would do dummy artwork for the boxes and after they were approved I did the camera-ready art so that it could be printed. I worked there until one of the partners did some tricks with the books and the place went out of business.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this analysis, the {{economics}} of MBI International’s three-phase surfactant washing system {{for the removal of}} polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from sediment was optimized. The system, which consists of a <b>screw</b> <b>washer,</b> an oil/water separator, and a vacuum filter, transfers PCBs to a sacrificial oil layer through two individual two-phase partitioning steps. At the completion of the washing process, the sacrificial oil layer is incinerated. Cleaned soil is disposed of in a municipal solid waste facility, and the spent surfactant layer is recycled. The washing system was modeled using the MATLAB mathematical program and an economical analysis was conducted using the results from the program. When connecting-equipment between operating units, product maintenance, and capital depreciation are considered, the economic results were reported with a 35 % confidence level. According to the cost analysis, the manufacturing cost to treat 20 tons of sediment per hour was determined to be approximately 15 million dollars. This cost includes the usage of 6 % (by volume) surfactant in the aqueous phase and 375 kilograms of sacrificial oil. The net profit was calculated to be approximately 56 thousand dollars. The three-phase surfactant washing system is technically feasible and sound. It is recommended that a pilot plant investigation be initiated for the patentpending process...|$|E

50|$|The {{prepared}} piano, {{present in}} some contemporary art {{music from the}} 20th and 21st century is a piano with objects placed inside it to alter its sound, or has had its mechanism changed in some other way. The scores for music for prepared piano specify the modifications, for example instructing the pianist to insert pieces of rubber, paper, metal <b>screws,</b> or <b>washers</b> in between the strings. These either mute the strings or alter their timbre. A harpsichord-like sound can be produced by placing or dangling small metal buttons {{in front of the}} hammer. Adding an eraser between the bass strings produces a mellow, thumpy sound reminiscent of the plucked double bass. Inserting metal <b>screws</b> or <b>washers</b> can cause the piano to make a jangly sound as these metal items vibrate against the strings. In 1954 a German company exhibited a wire-less piano at the Spring Fair in Frankfurt, Germany that sold for US$238.

40|$|Background: Sufficient inter-fragmentary {{compression}} is help-ful {{to achieve}} successful bony fusion in hindfoot arthrodesis using internal fixation by screws. Beside bone quality, {{the design of}} a screw influences inter-fragmentary compression. Compres-sive force is achievable for any kind of screw system; however, the primary deformation of the bone is different for the different screw systems. The work necessary to achieve compressive force for primary stability was measured for different screw systems and compared to an AO <b>screw</b> with <b>washer.</b> Materials and Methods: The compressive force was determined as a func-tion of screw advancement for 3 different cannulated screw types (7. 3 -mm AO screw with and without washer, the 6. 5 -mm Herbert screw and the 6. 5 -mm Ideal Compression Screw (I. CO. S) using different synthetic bone density (0. 16, 0. 24, 0. 48 g/ccm). Compressive force was measured indirectly, via screw tension measurement with strain gauges. Results: We calcu-lated the work to reach a limit of 60 N and the corresponding ratios to the value of the golden standard: I. CO. S (35. 2 %), Herbert (89. 0 %), AO <b>screw</b> without <b>washer</b> (116 %). Conclu-sion: All screw systems yielded acceptable results but the ICOS did produce greater compresion.

Methods: A group of 265 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction with ipsilateral flexor tendon grafts from the thigh in which the tibial fixation technique consisted of using a cortical <b>screw</b> and metal <b>washer,</b> between July 2000 and November 2007, were evaluated. Results: 176 patients were evaluated for an average of 33. 3 ± 19. 5 months; median of 29. 5 months; IIQ: 17 - 45 months; minimum of 8 and maximum of 87 months. There was no statistical difference regarding complaints of pain {{at the site of the}} screw (p = 0. 272) and the need to remove the tibial screw (p = 0. 633) between sexes.

Conclusion: The pain complaint rate at the screw site from the <b>screw</b> and metal <b>washer</b> method used for tibial fixation in ACL reconstruction was of the order of 25 %, and the screw had to be removed in 10. 8 % of the cases.

Many types o f profllometer systems currently exist and the past decade has seen the rise in popularity o f optical based systems, however most optical profilometers are expensive to purchase and to maintain. The development o f optical profilometers can also be exceptionally complex depending on the type o f system and its fragility may not make it suitable for m ost workshop or factory floor applications.

The developed system has a scanning table area of 200 by 120 millimetres and a vertical measurement range of five millimetres. The position o f the laser sensor above the target surface also has an adjustable range of 15 millimetres. A control program was developed to automatically scan user selected part and surface areas. This new system was characterised in terms of dimensional accuracy. The maximum cosine error of the system was measured at 0. 07 °. Dynamic accuracy of the system was measured at 2 fim in the Z-axis (height) and at approximately 10 |a. m in the X and Y axes.

40|$|Posterior {{cruciate}} ligament (PCL) insertion-site osteochondral avulsions in children, {{particularly from the}} tibia, are not commonly seen by orthopaedic surgeons. Because of the rarity of these injuries, careful attention to the specific physical examination and imaging findings seen with these injuries is necessary so that the proper diagnosis can be made. Osteochondral avulsions of the PCL can be missed on plain radiographs in skeletally immature patients, and therefore magnetic resonance imaging is necessary for proper diagnosis. With this knowledge, clinicians can formulate treatment plans which can return their patients to activities while avoiding potential morbidity resulting from missed diagnoses or improper treatment.
