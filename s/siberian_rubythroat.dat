50|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>rubythroat</b> (Calliope calliope) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} {{bird that}} was formerly classed {{as a member of}} the thrush family, Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher of the family Muscicapidae. The <b>Siberian</b> <b>rubythroat</b> and similar small European species are often called chats.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>rubythroat</b> was {{previously}} {{placed in the}} genus Luscinia. A large molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that Luscinia was not monophyletic. The genus was therefore split and several species including the <b>Siberian</b> <b>rubythroat</b> as the type species were moved to the reinstated genus Calliope. Calliope, from classical Greek meaning beautiful-voiced, {{was one of the}} muses in Greek mythology and presided over eloquence and heroic poetry.|$|E
50|$|The {{subspecies}} {{found in}} Afghanistan and the Tien Shans, ballioni, has the male paler than the nominate subspecies {{of the western}} Himalayas. In the central and eastern Himalayas of Sikkim and Bhutan, confusa, is similar but has the male blacker above with a more prominent white forehead. It has a face pattern that resembles that of the <b>Siberian</b> <b>rubythroat</b> and a strong white submoustachial streak. The thin supercila over the eyes do not meet at the forehead. Being rather distinctive and possibly closer to the <b>Siberian</b> <b>rubythroat,</b> the taxonomy and placement of this population {{as well as the}} overall treatment of this species pair has been questioned.|$|E
5000|$|The Chinese rubythroat (Calliope tschebaiewi) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in {{the family}} Muscicapidae. It {{is closely related to}} the <b>Siberian</b> <b>rubythroat</b> which however lacks the distinctive white tail-tips and white tail bases. It was also previously considered conspecific with the Himalayan rubythroat, together called the white-tailed rubythroat. It is found along the Himalayan ranges from Pakistan to Myanmar.|$|E
50|$|The {{islands are}} also frequented by vagrant Asiatic birds, {{including}} the common rosefinch, <b>Siberian</b> <b>rubythroat,</b> bluethroat, lanceolated warbler, {{and the first}} North American record of the intermediate egret. Other animals in the Aleutian Chain include the Arctic fox, American mink, Porcupine caribou, northern sea otter, horned puffin, tufted puffin, Steller sea lion, spotted seal, ringed seal, northern fur seal and many more.|$|E
50|$|The Aleutians {{are home}} to many large colonies of seabirds. Buldir Island has 21 {{breeding}} seabird species, including the Bering Sea-endemic red-legged kittiwake. Large seabird colonies are also present at Kiska, Gareloi, Semisopochnoi, Bogoslof, and others. The islands are also frequented by vagrant Asiatic birds, including the common rosefinch, <b>Siberian</b> <b>rubythroat,</b> bluethroat, lanceolated warbler, and the first North American record of the intermediate egret.|$|E
50|$|The Himalayan rubythroat (Calliope pectoralis) is {{a species}} of {{passerine}} bird in the family Muscicapidae. It {{is closely related to}} the <b>Siberian</b> <b>rubythroat</b> which however lacks the distinctive white tail-tips and white tail bases. It was also previously considered conspecific with the Chinese rubythroat, together called the white-tailed rubythroat. It is found along the Himalayan ranges from Afghanistan to Burma. Three subspecies are recognized across its wide range.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is found}} in Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, ranging across Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The move up north and into higher altitudes in summer and move into lower {{elevations}} to the south in winter. Subspecies ballioni {{is found in}} the western and northern part of its range while the nominate population occurs along the western and central Himalayas in India. Subspecies confusa which may well represent clinal variation {{in the darkness of the}} upper plumage of the male is found from Sikkim to Assam. Subspecies tschebaiewi which breeds along the edge of the Tibetan plateau winters to its south from Nepal to Assam. [...] Its natural habitat is open woodland and scrub. They may sometimes occur in summer on the lower plains but a record from further south at Londa near Goa has been determined as a misidentified <b>Siberian</b> <b>rubythroat.</b>|$|E
40|$|In 2013, 73, 529 {{birds of}} 161 species were ringed in Slovenia, with 114 finds from abroad, 73 finds of foreign-ringed birds and 1580 local finds. The most {{numerous}} ringed species were Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla and Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica, while among ringed nestlings Great Tits Parus major and Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus prevailed. The most numerous species among recoveries was the Mute Swan Cygnus olor with probably the oldest swan recorded in Slovenia so far, a 25 -year-old female. The longest distance recovery concerned a Sedge Warbler Acrocephalus schoenobaenus from Norway (2, 801 km). Of interest among local finds {{is the longest}} recovery distance (122 km) recorded for Ural Owl Strix uralensis in Slovenia so far. In 2013, two rare species for Slovenia were ringed, Yellow-browed Warbler Phylloscopus inornatus (2 individuals) and <b>Siberian</b> <b>Rubythroat</b> Calliope calliope, {{which was the first}} record for Slovenia. The first analysis of ringing sites in Slovenia is given as a baseline for establishing a network of Constant Effort Site...|$|E
40|$|This {{report by}} the Slovenian Rarities Committee {{presents}} records of rare bird species in Slovenia in 2013, with some addenda for previous years. The numbers in brackets refer {{to the number of}} records (first number) and individuals (second number), recorded between 1 Jan 1950 and 31 Dec 2012. Since 1 Jan 2013, submission to the Committee is required for 37 additional species, 17 of which are regional rarities. Records of these species are not numbered, since records from previous years were not collected by the Committee. Four new species were recorded in category A: White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala, Baillon’s Crake Porzana pusilla, Audouin’s Gull Larus audouinii and <b>Siberian</b> <b>Rubythroat</b> Calliope calliope. Three species, Helmeted Guineafowl Numida meleagris, Chukar Alectoris chukar and Common Bulbul Pycnonotus barbatus, were added to category E. Other notable observations were the second and third records of Bewick’s Swan Cygnus columbianus and fourth record of Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus. The list of birds recorded in Slovenia (as of 31 Dec 2013) contains 384 species (369 in category A, 7 in category B, 8 exclusively in category C; 4 species are both in categories A and C). Category D contains 6 species, while category E contains 33. These two categories {{are not part of the}} lis...|$|E
40|$|Having {{valuable}} high-quality stopover sites {{available for}} migratory birds {{is one of}} the [...] key factors for the success of migration.
