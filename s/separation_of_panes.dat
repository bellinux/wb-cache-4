40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The concept of {{providing}} an evacuated space between two planar surfaces and exploiting its thermal properties was initially proposed in 1913 for window applications in buildings (Zoller, 1913). Since then {{a number of}} designs for the fabrication of evacuated windows have been proposed investigating sealing methods for the periphery <b>of</b> the glass <b>panes</b> and methods <b>of</b> maintaining the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the glass <b>panes</b> {{under the influence of}} atmospheric pressure (Collins et al., 1995). Evacuated windows have also been used in solar applications by creating a vacuum (less than 0. 01 mbar) around a solar absorber to reduce the convective heat losses resulting in higher efficiencies. Maintaining the vacuum pressure over the life time of the panel is challenging. This is largely dependent on the materials used in the fabrication process. Forming a durable hermetic seal around the periphery of the vacuum enclosure is particularly crucial. In this work prototypes of flat vacuum panels with solar applications are fabricated and tested. Indium is used as a sealing material to create a hermetic seal around the periphery the panel. A heat transmission of 0. 86 Wm- 2 K- 1 in the centre of the vacuum panel has been achieved for a 0. 4 m by 0. 4 m panel...|$|R

Through the violence of cutting her skin with razor blades or putting out fires with her bare hands and feet, Pane intended to incite a [...] "real experience" [...] in the viewer, who would be moved to empathize with her discomfort. [...] The shocking nature of these early performances — or [...] "actions," [...] as she preferred to call them — often overshadowed her prolific photographic and sculptural practice. However, the body was a central concern in all <b>of</b> <b>Pane's</b> work, whether literally or conceptually.|$|R

60|$|The second-class coaches had {{of course}} the merit of being cheaper, but {{this was more than}} offset by the fact that in place <b>of</b> <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> glass their windows had slats of wood with white cotton {{stretched}} over them,--an ingenious contrivance for shutting out the view and a good bit of the light, both of which are pleasing, and for letting in the cold, which is not.|$|R

Through this window Rollo could see the head of a man. The man was standing in a recess which contained the wheel by means of which the ship was steered.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the stadium's {{surface was}} a Tifway 419 Bermuda grass, {{specifically}} bred for indoor use. The dome's ceiling contained thousands <b>of</b> semitransparent <b>panes</b> made <b>of</b> Lucite. Players quickly complained that glare coming off <b>of</b> the <b>panes</b> {{made it hard}} for them to track fly balls; to solve the problem, two sections <b>of</b> <b>panes</b> were painted white in April. However, within a few months, the grass died from lack of sunlight. For most of the 1965 season, the Astros played on green-painted dirt and dead grass. The clear panels also added a problem when combined with the natural grass. The grass tended to hold, then release moisture, often resulting in rain within the structure, causing games to be delayed while the grounds crews cleaned up the playing surface.|$|R

In the K6 the number of rows was increased to 8, and the central column <b>of</b> <b>panes</b> was made considerably wider than those to either side.

5000|$|Unusual {{traits of}} the house are its lack of chimney-tops and its large but low-placed windows.

50|$|A multi-lite {{window is}} a window glazed with small <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> glass {{separated}} by wooden or lead glazing bars, or muntins, arranged in a decorative glazing pattern often dictated by the building's architectural style.

50|$|The ABC version's puzzle {{board was}} made up <b>of</b> {{translucent}} <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> glass. <b>Panes</b> {{that were part of}} a puzzle were illuminated blue on the sides.

5000|$|The story <b>of</b> the 666 <b>panes</b> {{originated}} in the 1980s, when the official brochure published during construction did indeed cite this number (even twice, though a few pages earlier the total number <b>of</b> <b>panes</b> was given as 672 instead). The number 666 was also mentioned in various newspapers. The Louvre museum, however, states that the finished pyramid contains 673 glass panes (603 rhombi and 70 triangles). [...] A higher figure was obtained by David A. Shugarts, who reports that the pyramid contains 689 pieces of glass. Shugarts obtained the figure from the Pei's offices.|$|R
