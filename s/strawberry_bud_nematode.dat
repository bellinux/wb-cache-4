40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{performed}} a pest categorisation of the <b>strawberry</b> <b>bud</b> weevil, Anthonomus signatus Say, (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), for the EU. A. signatus is a well-defined and distinguishable species, recognised as a pest of strawberry (Fragaria) fruit production in eastern North America {{where it is}} also a pest of Rubus. There are reports of A. signatus associated with non-rosaceous plants such as Mentha, Nepeta, Rhododendron and Solidago although whether such plants are true hosts is uncertain. This pest categorisation focuses on Fragaria and Rubus as hosts. Anthonomus signatus is not known to occur in the EU. It is listed in Annex IIAI of Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. The international trade in Fragaria and Rubus plants for planting provides a potential pathway to introduce A. signatus from North America. Considering climatic similarities between North America and the EU, the thermal biology of A. signatus and host distribution in the EU, A. signatus has the potential to establish within the EU. There would be one generation per year, as in North America. As a pest of field grown Fragaria and Rubus, A. signatus would not be expected to establish in EU glasshouses. In North America, adults clip developing buds, preventing fruit development and reducing yield. Losses are variable and depend on the cultivars attacked. Severe crop losses have been reported. However, some Fragaria cultivars can compensate the loss of buds, e. g. by increasing the weight of fruits developing on remaining buds. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of introduction of A. signatus from North America. All criteria assessed by EFSA for consideration as a potential Union quarantine pest are met. As A. signatus is not known to occur in the EU, this criterion assessed by EFSA to consider it as a Union regulated non-quarantine pest is not met...|$|R
40|$|Aphelenchoides bicaudatus {{nematodes}} {{were identified}} in planting materials and water samples from 35 floral ornamental nurseries in Taiwan. A pure line of the nematode was established from the bulk samples collected, and the nematode was identified as A. bicaudatus {{on the basis of}} morphometric data and the 18 S gene sequence (GU 984233). Host range tests were conducted by inoculating A. bicaudatus onto Phalaenopsis spp. strawberry, rice, bird’s-nest fern, cyclamen, dendrobium, African violet, and saxifrage (all reported hosts of A. besseyi). Symptoms did not develop during the 4 weeks following inoculation. However, after staining, both eggs and nematodes inside plant tissue of Phalaenopsis roots, <b>strawberry</b> leaf <b>buds,</b> and rice sheath indicated that A. bicaudatus had established in these hosts. These results revealed a potential new host–parasite relationship of A. bicaudatus, and suggest that this nematode may infect these economically important hosts...|$|R
40|$|Fergusobia {{nematodes}} and Fergusonina flies are mutualists {{that cause}} {{a variety of}} gall types on myrtaceous plant buds and young leaves. The biology of an isolate of the gall complex was studied in its native range in Australia for possible use in southern Florida as a biological control agent against the invasive broad-leaved paperbark tree, Melaleuca quinquenervia. Timed studies with caged Fergusonina flies on young branches of M. quinquenervia revealed that females are synovigenic with lifetime fecundities of 183 ± 42 (standard error; SE) eggs and longevities of 17 ± 2 days. None of the male flies but all dissected female flies contained parasitic female nematodes (range = 3 – 15), nematode eggs (12 – 112), and nematode juveniles (78 – 1, 750). Female flies deposited eggs (34 ± 6; 8 – 77 per <b>bud)</b> and <b>nematode</b> juveniles (114 ± 15; 44 – 207 per bud) into bud apices within 15 days. Histological sections of shoot <b>buds</b> suggested that <b>nematodes</b> induce the formation of hypertrophied, uninucleate plant cells prior to fly larval eclosion. Enlarged size, granular cytoplasm, and enlarged nucleus and nucleolus characterized these cells, which appeared {{similar to those of}} other species galled by nematodes in the Anguinidae. Observations of ovipositional behavior revealed that female Fergusonina sp. create diagnostic oviposition scars. The presence of these scars may facilitate recognition of host use during specificity screening. R. M. Giblin-Davis, J. Makinson, B. J. Center, K. A. Davies, M. Purcell, G. S. Taylor, S. J.

40|$|Two grape cultivars, {{susceptible}} French Colombard and tolerant Rubired, {{and four}} nematodes, Meloidogyne incognita, Pratylenchus vulnus, Tylenchulus semipenetrans, and Xiphinema index, {{were used to}} quantify the equilibrium between root (R) and shoot (S) growth. Root and shoot growth of French Colombard was retarded by M. incognita, P. vulnus, and X. index but not by T. semipenetrans. Although the root growth of Rubired was limited by all the nematodes, the shoot growth was limited only by X. index. The R:S ratios of Rubired were {{higher than those of}} French Colombard. The reduced R:S ratios of Rubired were primarily an expression of reduction in root systems without an equal reduction in shoot growth, whereas in French Colombard the reduced R:S ratios were due to a reduction in both shoot growth and root growth and to a greater reduction in root growth than shoot growth. All nematodes reproduced equally well on both cultivars. Both foliage and root growth of French Colombard were significantly reduced by M. incognita and P. vulnus. Nematodes reduced the shoot length by reducing the internode length. Accumulative R:S ratios in inoculated plants were significantly smaller than those in controls in all nematode treatments but not at individual harvest dates. Bud break was delayed by X. index and was initiated earlier by P. vulnus and M. incognita. All <b>buds</b> in <b>nematode</b> treatments were less vigorous than in controls...|$|R
40|$|In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, {{the onset}} of sexual {{development}} is controlled mainly by two external signals, nutrient starvation and mating pheromone availability. We have isolated a novel gene named rcd 1 + as a key factor required for nitrogen starvation-induced sexual development. rcd 1 + encodes a 283 -amino-acid protein with no particular motifs. However, genes highly homologous to rcd 1 + (encoding amino acids with > 70 % identity) are present at least in <b>budding</b> yeasts, plants, <b>nematodes,</b> and humans. Cells with rcd 1 + deleted are sterile if sexual development is induced by nitrogen starvation but fertile if it is induced by glucose starvation. This results largely from a defect in nitrogen starvation-invoked induction of ste 11 +, a key transcriptional factor gene required for {{the onset of}} sexual development. The striking conservation of the gene throughout eukaryotes may suggest {{the presence of an}} evolutionarily conserved differentiation controlling system...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{pathogenicity}} and overwintering {{survival of the}} foliar nematode, Aphelenchoides fragariae, infecting Hosta spp. Nematodes applied to either lower or upper sides of noninjured and injured hosta leaves were able to infect and produce typical symptoms on nine cultivars. Leaves of only four cultivars (Borschi, Fragrant Blue, Patomic Pride, and Olive Bailey Langdon) showed no symptoms of nematode infection. The nematodes overwintered as juveniles and adults in soil, dry leaves, and dormant buds, but not in roots. Nematode winter survival was higher in dormant buds and soil from the polyhouse than in an open home garden. Of the nematodes found in the dormant buds, 35 % to 79 % were located between the first two outside layers of the <b>buds.</b> The <b>nematodes</b> tolerated 8 hr exposure to 40 °C and − 80 °C in leaf tissues. Relative humidity influenced nematode migration from soil to leaves. The presence of nematodes only on the outer surface of foliage (leaves and petioles) confirmed the migration of A. fragariae {{on the surface of}} the plants. Of the total number of nematodes found on the foliage, 25 % to 46 % and 66 % to 77 % were alive at 90 % and 100 % relative humidity, respectively, suggesting that high moisture is required for the survival and upward movement of nematodes. We conclude that A. fragariae can overwinter in soil, infected dry leaves, and dormant buds and migrate in films of water on the outer surface of the plant during spring to leaves to initiate infection...|$|R
