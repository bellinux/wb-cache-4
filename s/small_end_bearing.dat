(This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The connecting rod <b>small</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a sleeve bearing or needle bearing into {{the eye of the}} small end, which has an interference fit with the aperture of the small end. During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the small end eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the small end eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|E
40|$|Main and {{connecting}} rod bearings along the crankshaft in a heavy-duty engine oil system requires efficient feed of oil flow to ensure the performance of lubrication, cooling and cleaning. The bearings and builded bearing models considered in this work {{are based on a}} Volvo 13 L engine. Two main models to predict the oil flow in main {{and connecting}} rod bearings have been investigated using the system analysis software GT-SUITE. These two models are based on two numerical methods called  the Mobility method and the Reynold's equation respectively. The main bearing and the connecting rod large end bearing loads calculated in the present work is similar to the reference bearing loads, especially for connecting rod large end bearing and at lower engine speeds. For higher engine speeds, the present load results are far off,  compared to the reference load results. This difference at the higher engine speeds showed also an increased difference in the oil volume flow rates. But more information regarding the calculations of the reference loads is needed to analyze the differences further. Considering the "split lines", where the upper and the lower bearing shell meet, in the bearing models increased the oil volume flow rate with 13. 3 % on average for the main bearing. Main bearing stand for 86 % of the total flow whilst connecting rod large end and <b>small</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> stand for the rest 13 % and 1 % of the total flow. The feed of oil to main bearing and connecting rod large end bearing appears continuously whilst the feed of oil to connecting rod <b>small</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> appears {{in the form of a}} few pulsations. Comparing to the numerical reference flow results, the results in this work are similar at high oil temperatures and at low engine speeds, otherwise the results are far off. Considering the Reynold's equation when predicting the oil volume flow rates in plain journal bearings is a more accurate way than using the Mobility method since it takes more specific geometrical irregularities into account. The oil volume flow rate for main bearing differ with 2. 7 % on average when solving the Reynold's equation compared to the Mobility method...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{vertical}} {{bearing capacity}} of a bucket foundation installed in sand can be calculated as sum of the skin friction and <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity. However, the current design equations are not considering the non-associated flow characteristics of sand and {{the reduction in the}} skin friction and increase in the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity when the vertical load is applied. In this study, we perform two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element analyses following non-associated flow rule and calculate the vertical bearing capacity of circular bucket foundation of various sizes installed in sand of different friction angles. After calculating the skin friction and <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> force at the ultimate state, design equations are derived for each. The skin friction of bucket foundation is shown significantly small compared to the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity. Considering the difference with the available design equation for piles, it is recommended that the equation for piles is used for the bucket foundation. A new shape-depth factor (sq･dq) for bucket foundation is recommended which also accounts for the increment of the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity due to skin friction.

40|$|AbstractOn {{the basis}} of the {{mechanism}} of tapered piles and evidence obtained from small scale model tests, this paper proposes cylindrical and spherical cavity expansion theories to evaluate the skin friction by introducing a stress–dilatancy relationship, as well as the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of tapered piles by introducing a tapering factor. In general, in order to evaluate the skin friction, either the angle of internal friction or dilatancy angle is assumed to be constant. This research improves on this drawback and considers both properties to calculate the skin friction through an iterative process in the load transfer method. At the mean time, the effect of angle of tapering is introduced to evaluate the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of tapered piles. The test results and proposed models show that a slight increase in the tapering angle of the pile results in higher skin friction and affects the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> resistance compared with conventional straight piles on different types of sands at different relative densities.

[1], {{based on a}} mass-conserving formulation of the Reynolds equation using the concept of complementarity is suitably extended to include the effects of compressibility, piezoviscosity and shear-thinning on the lubricant properties. This improved algorithm is employed to analyse {{the performance of the}} lubricated <b>small</b> <b>end</b> and big <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> of a connecting rod of a high performance motorbike engine. The application of the algorithm proposed to both the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> and the big end of a con-rod is challenging because of the different causes that sustain the hydrodynamic lubrication in the two cases. In the con-rod big end, the fluid film is mainly generated by the relative high speed rotation between the rod and the crankshaft. The relative speed between the two races forms a wedge of fluid that assures appropriate lubrication and avoids undesired direct contacts. On the contrary, at the con-rod <b>small</b> <b>end</b> the relative rotational speed is low and a complete rotation between the mating surfaces does not occurs since the con-rod only oscillates around its vertical axis. Thus, at every revolution of the crankshaft, there are two different moments in which the relative rotational speed between the con-rod and the piston pin is null. Therefore, the dominant effect in the lubrication is the squeeze caused by the high loads transmitted through the piston pin. In particular both combustion forces and inertial forces contribute to the squeeze effect. This work shows how the formulation developed by the authors is capable of predicting the performance of journal bearings in the unsteady regime, where cavitation and reformation occur several times. Moreover, the effects of the pressure and the shear rate on the density and on the viscosity of the lubricant are taken into account...|$|R

With the ever-increasing quest to improve engine performance, and the consequent increase of the rotational speed and combustion/inertial loads, the cavitation of the lubricant used in conrod big <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> may play a crucial role in the assessment of bearing durability. To overcome problems related to film cavitation, palliatives such as the reduction of the clearance between the components, the increase of the oil supply pressure and/or the use of harder coating materials have been commonly adopted.

The cavitation damage has been studied for more than a century both theoretically [2 - 5] and experimentally [6, 7], and many attempts have been made to predict or measure the pressure spikes developing in the cavitated areas due to bubble collapse. Although a universally accepted theory seems not to exist, it is clear that the cavitation damage occurs due to the rapid and violent collapse of the vapour bubbles in the proximity of a solid boundary.
