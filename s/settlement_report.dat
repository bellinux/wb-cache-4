After First Rohilla War(1773-1774), Rohilkhand (or Rohilla Riyāsat) fell to Awadh and later in the hands of East India Company after treaty of 1801 with Nawab Saadat Ali Khan II. In 1801-2, Rohilkhand was divided into two districts, Bareilly and Moradabad. Afterwards, several new districts (Pilibhit, Rampur, Shahjanpur, Rudrapur and others) were carved out of Rohilkhand and some parts were transferred to other districts (Kaimganj to district Farrukhabad and Gola to district Lakhimpur). In 1821, the Budaun District was formed and in the same year a Tehsildaree was established at Nawabganj and a new Nawabganj pargana was formed by taking villages from Crore (now Tehsil Sadar, Bareilly), Bisalpur, and Pilibhit covering an area more than 1,40,000 acres with nearly 1,00,000 acres of cultivated land.

40|$|Many service {{transactions}} are highly complex, and their quality {{is difficult to}} ascertain for consumers. In order to have properly functioning service markets, the services thus often require regulation. However, {{with the advent of}} the WTO, international trade in services has become increasingly rule-bound. GATS has considerable, intricate effects on social regulation due to the characteristics of services. The allocation of regulatory jurisdiction between home and host country, for example, is rendered difficult by the process-based nature of a lot of services. The WTO US – Gambling dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>report</b> is the first to address GATS disciplines on social regulation in a detailed manner. This working paper submits that the US - Gambling report has increased interference with domestic social regulation and created regulatory uncertainty for WTO members. However, it is also argued that the real impact of the GATS on social regulation can only be understood by looking beyond the text of the GATS. GATS disciplines may become amplified through their interaction with domestic and other international law. The GATS also contains some “political” counterbalancing mechanisms that allow members to renegotiate their commitments. It is argued that these political mechanisms strengthen subsidiarity in the GATS, and make WTO dispute settlement bodies accountable to WTO members...|$|E
