40|$|An {{intellectual}} {{deficit is}} known to exist in populations where extreme poverty is rife and is thus seen extensively in the lower socio-economic strata of underdeveloped nations. Poverty is a complex entity whose sociological and economic indicators often bear little relevance to the biological agents which can affect the central nervous system. An attempt is made to express poverty in terms of identifiable defects, physiological in nature. Thus adverse socio-economic factors are converted into specific biological entities which, though necessary for adequate development of the brain, are restricted where there is poverty. A number of causative deficiencies, including nutritional, visual, auditory, tactile, vestibular, affective, and other stimuli are postulated. These interact and potentiate one another. Each is capable of an independent action on the brain and examples are given of some <b>sensory</b> <b>deprivations</b> as well as malnutrition and their possible mechanism of action. If the various deficiencies can independently harm the brain, then a number of separate specific functions should be affected; examples are offered. The nature of this intellectual deficit is probably a non-fulfillment of genetic potential of certain specific functions of the brain, which may exhibit limited variations between one community and another, depending on cultural differences. The deleterious effect of this intellectual impairment is seen most clearly in figures of school desertion, for example in Latin America. Analogous data for adults is scarce. ...|$|R

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{possibility is}} disinhibited feedback, or {{a reduction in}} the amount of inhibition along normally existing feedback pathways. Normally, excitation and inhibition are balanced. However, if normal feedback were not inhibited as usual, then signals feeding back from late stages of multi-sensory processing might influence earlier stages such that tones could activate vision. Cytowic and Eagleman find support for the disinhibition idea in the so-called acquired forms of synesthesia that occur in non-synesthetes under certain conditions: temporal lobe epilepsy, head trauma, stroke, and brain tumors. They also note that it can likewise occur during stages of meditation, deep concentration, <b>sensory</b> <b>deprivation,</b> or with use of psychedelics such as LSD or mescaline, and even, in some cases, marijuana. However, synesthetes report that common stimulants, like caffeine and cigarettes do not affect the strength of their synesthesia, nor does alcohol.|$|E
40|$|Since the 1980 ’s a {{huge amount}} of {{evidence}} has been gathered proving cortical plasticity in adult higher mammals. Prospects of using transgenic mice currently focus molecular research on this lower mammal. In our study we search for evidence of cortical reorganisation in the adult visual system of the mouse. We first performed in situ hybridisation for the immediate early genes (IEG) zif 268 and arc on mouse brain after 1 until 7 weeks of survival following monocular enucleation (right eye). Within this recovery period there is a gradual increase of the signal of the activity marker Zif 268 in the left, visually-deprived hemisphere. For the IEG arc only the signal in the left binocular zone increased. A popular explanation for this recovery is the take-over of the inactive part of the ipsilateral visual cortex by the non-deprived eye but, nevertheless also somatosensory and auditory stimuli may cause the restoration of activity. To demonstrate these propositions we enucleated the remaining left eye, trimmed right side vibrissae and inactivated the right cochlea after 7 weeks of right eye deprivation. Surprisingly, based on zif 268 expression the activity in the visual cortex was still quite high and only infragranular layers showed a small decrease for the zif 268 signal after the different <b>sensory</b> <b>deprivations.</b> For arc on the other hand we noticed an increase in signal in the binocular zone after somatosensory and auditory deprivations, but also discovered a decrease in signal upon complete visual deprivation. We can conclude that within adult mouse V 1 zif 268 expressing cells can be multimodal while arc expressing cells appear as purely visually driven. status: submitte...|$|R

40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} that experience dependent mechanisms shape the pain system during the development. In view of that painful stimuli are rare during development {{it is not clear}} how this is accomplished. In this thesis it is confirmed, using a battery of <b>sensory</b> <b>deprivations</b> in the rat, that the development of an essential component of the pain system, the nociceptive withdrawal reflexes (NWR), is subject to experience dependent learning. Moreover, the learning in the NWR occurs despite absence of nociceptive stimuli. Instead it requires tactile experience. This novel ‘cross-modality learning’ occurs within a particular time window during development, normally lasting 5 - 7 days, after which the central connections are stabilized. A correlation between the cross modality learning and spontaneous movements was established. The spontaneous tail movements, studied during the postnatal days 1 - 25, were found to be generated in the spinal cord. They peak postnatally, preced and overlap in time the functional adaptation of NWR. The NWR adaptation occurs simultaneously with a qualitative change in spontaneous movements (towards simple uni-directional movements), presumably reflecting a maturation of spinal reflex circuits connections. It is proposed that an unsupervised correlation-based learning mechanism, using spontaneous muscle twitches, account for the functional adaptation of the NWR system. In this learning mechanism, spontaneously active reflex interneurones cause movements that in turn lead to altered sensory feedback informing about the consequencies of the movements, which is used to set the gain in the nociceptive connections. A simulation of this new learning mechanism, termed Motor Directed Somatosensory Imprinting (MDSI), showed that it is plausible. In behavioural experiments, it was demonstrated that tactile feedback resulting from spontaneous muscle twitches during sleep(Blumberg and Lucas, 1996 b;Blumberg and Lucas, 1994 a) indeed modifies the sensorimotor transformation in young rats in the predicted manner. These findings thus indicate that spontaneous movements, corresponding to human foetal movements, play a key role for establishing functional nociceptive networks. This learning occurs during a sleep state called active sleep, which is similar to REM sleep in adults, indicating a novel role for sleep in learning and memory...|$|R
