40|$|Summary The primary {{objective}} {{of the majority of}} social assistance schemes is to reduce poverty, and targeting is often considered an important tool to reach this objective more efficiently and effec-tively. This paper investigates the efficiency and effectiveness of a targeted benefit scheme that uses a hybrid form of targeting and is subject to a tight budget constraint, namely the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>scheme</b> in Kosovo. In recognition of the long-term detrimental and negative consequences of child poverty, we focus particularly on the scheme’s impact on children. A mixed method approach is used to investigate both the economic and non-economic costs and implications. Findings suggest that the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>scheme</b> is highly efficient but excludes many poor children. Poverty impacts are limited and the scheme does not resonate well with its recipients. Policy simulations indicate that incremental budget increases have the potential to greatly reduce child poverty when implemented hand-in-hand with amendments to the current <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>scheme...</b>|$|E
40|$|Social Assistance Schemes {{are part}} of social {{protection}} systems that aim poverty alleviation. Social assistance benefits are designed {{with the purpose of}} providing the poor with minimum standards of living as means to escape from poverty. Different countries have implemented different provisions regarding the amount of social assistance benefits, the eligibility criteria, as well as the types of cash and in-kind benefits provided as part of social assistance schemes. These differences have been based on the conditions and instruments each country has used to target the marginalized groups. The development of social protection schemes in Kosovo has started in the beginning of 21 st century with support and intervention of international organizations led by their priorities and interests. In the beginning, when UNMIK came in 1999 the main focus of the scheme was emergency relief; two years after the focus shifted to a social safety net where UNMIK was tasked with development of new <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>scheme.</b> In 2001 the MLSW and DSW established the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>scheme.</b> Law on <b>Social</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Scheme</b> in Kosovo was enacted in 2003 which regulates the monthly amount of benefits for families who fulfill the eligibility criteria’s. In January 2009 decentralization of current scheme occurred and the responsibility was passed to Centers for Social Work (CSW). The <b>Social</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Scheme</b> in Kosovo is composed of three parts: last-resort income support (LRIS) scheme, war veteran benefits, and disability pensions. The LRIS component aims poverty alleviation. In this Honors project, I analyze the effectiveness of <b>Social</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Scheme</b> in alleviating poverty in Kosovo. A major part of my analysis consists of a critical review of provisions of The Law on Social Assistance. The analysis shows that the current provisions of the Law are well targeted; however, there are issues with the coverage and with the amount of social assistance, which is considered insufficient to help the beneficiaries escape from poverty. Information obtained from interviews suggests that there are issues with the design of the scheme that create space for exclusion {{and at the same time}} end up benefiting some non-poor households which accounts for inclusion error.

40|$|Decentralisation is {{invariably}} {{among the}} recommendations that international {{organisations such as}} the World Bank make for an enhancement of social provisions, and particularly a better targeting of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> regimes, in Eastern and Central Europe. However, theoretical literature as wel as empirical research suggests that decentralisation is not by defintion a panacea, especially when it concerns the transfers of competencies {{in the matter of}} social protection systems. It is true that there are arguments to promote redistributive activity at lower levels of government but whith regard to policies aimed at redistribution and reducing poverty (and welfare generosity) the assumption that redistribution is best organised at the central level is rather dominant. Fundamental constraints on redistribution by lower level governments would -according to this line of reasoning- facilitate a 'race to the bottom'. This paper investigates the relationship between the generosity of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> benefits and several dimensions of decentralisation (the administration, decision-making and funding of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>schemes)</b> at two levels of government (the substate and the local level) in 21 OECD countries by means of a fuzzy set analysis. The results indicate that social asssitance benefits are more adequate in countries where the decision-making, funding and administration of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>schemes</b> is controlled by the central government and in countries where central or substate governments set the basic <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> rates and housing benefits while sharing funding liabilities with the local government level. When Central and Eastern European countries opt for decentralisation as an instrument of poverty alleviation – through a better targeting of benefits -, prudence is called for the fact {{that there might be a}} trade-off between the transfer of competencies to lowel levels of government and the generosity of welfare programmes. ...|$|R

40|$|Welfare {{reform in}} middle income countries, where formal {{institutions}} conventionally have an exclusionary character and informal institutions {{are central to}} social welfare, {{has been marked by}} a drastic rise of means-tested <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>schemes.</b> This dissertation analyses, with an empirical focus on Turkey, the potential of these schemes to expand social rights by creating new formal entitlements for previously excluded groups. The number and the scope of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>schemes</b> in Turkey have shown a remarkable increase, especially after the 2001 economic crisis, accompanied by significant institutionalisation. Yet, we argue that whilst <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> has grown distinctively and {{become an integral part of}} the emerging welfare regime, certain characteristics of the previous regime were ultimately reproduced within new institutions due to the content of current schemes and the institutional structure of implementation. These include the association of mainstream welfare institutions with social insurance, the ambiguous role of the state towards the excluded parts of the society, the reliance on family relations and informal employment, and the prevalence of paternalist or clientelist motivations. Consequently, the potential of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> to extend formalised rights to the entire population was undermined, and the outcome has been the consolidation of a semi-formal welfare regime. To substantiate this argument, the dissertation develops a historical institutionalist framework and examines the elements of institutional change and continuity as well as the processes of change. Our three empirical chapters then focus on the development of legal, organisational, ideational and political bases of social assistance; trends in policy outcomes from the perspectives of decommodification, commodification, defamilialisation and declientelisation; and the functioning of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> through semi-autonomous foundations at the local level. Empirically, we build our argument on a comprehensive evidence base including a wide range of policy documents and qualitative interviews. Theoretically, we discuss the implications of our findings for the literatures on welfare regimes and institutionalism, stressing the importance of implementation structures, the co-existence of institutional change and continuity, and the suggestion of a semi-formal regime type...|$|R

The Brazilian government has been operating its Bolsa Família Program (BFP) since 2003. It is the CCT program with the highest amount of grantees worldwide (De Brauw et al,. 2013 : 488). Cash grants are handed out to female grantees of the BFP (De Brauw et al., 2013 : 487). The research of this thesis will focus on the question in how far the BFP has an impact on female empowerment. The first chapter will be centred on an academic debate of the concepts of empowerment and specifically female empowerment. Moreover, CCT programmes in general will be defined, as well as their pros, cons and their link to female empowerment. The second chapter will place the BFP within the wider, historical perspective of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> and earlier CCT programs in Brazil. Firstly, a concise history of the first <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> initiatives and the first federal initiative will be provided.
