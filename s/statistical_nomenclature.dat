The aim of the paper is the empirical verification of influence of local life standard in Southern Poland on small and medium-sized enterprises’ development. The southern region was defined using European <b>statistical</b> <b>nomenclature</b> NUTS- 1 as the area of two voivodeships: Małopolska (Lesser Poland) and Śląsk (Silesia).

40|$|Although a {{great deal}} of {{occupational}} exposure data is collected, it is probably insufficient to truly answer the question of legislative compliance, ill directed in terms of real workplace risks, and is of little subsequent use for epidemiological research. This paper is an attempt to summarise the more important components and requirements of a sampling strategy, and it is therefore aimed at those with this responsibility. Perhaps, all too frequently, the more esoteric nature of these issues and their research means that they are published in journals outside the normal sphere of readership, or when it is within that sphere the quantity of <b>statistical</b> <b>nomenclature</b> and content makes it too daunting to attempt to read. By simplifying and summarising, this paper is intended to help justify a change in the sampling programme and to initiate debate...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the information to be collected for aseptic dispensing in NHS hospitals, and its use for management and business purposes in relation to capacity, demand, performance and efficiency. Mixed methodologies were adopted on an exploratory basis. Qualitative methods included: regular expert input; workshops; out-turn questionnaires; Affinity Analysis; surveys; and structured interviews. Quantitative methods included: activity data surveys; targeted surveys; and Delphi methods. The research systematised the collection and collation of the required data and determined novel ways of analysing and manipulating it to aid decision-making. These were used to evaluate the impact of major capital investment and variations in practices between different parts of the country. A benchmarking approach should be applied in utilising the data and <b>statistical</b> indicators. <b>Nomenclature</b> issues can influence data quality. Therefore clear, unambiguous guidance was developed for data collection. Existing pharmaceutical information systems will be the main sources of the data for the foreseeable future. The research focused on the North West of England, with successful application in the West Midlands. Its transferability to non-NHS and foreign hospitals is inferred, as long as similar operational arrangements apply. The research enables: the measurement of progress towards implementing the Breckenridge (1996) recommendations; the evaluation of performance for aseptic production and usage to inform capacity planning; and the presentation of the degree of collaboration between hospitals. The research addresses the absence of set data for an important hospital support service, and applies relevant lessons from other fields and industries. It enables a systematic approach to capacity planning and performance evaluation, {{at a time when the}} contribution of the service to support clinical governance is being fully recognised...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{new idea}} of {{functional}} regions {{has been interpreted}} in alignment {{with the idea of}} functional urban areas in the Serbian planning discourse and practice. The new Spatial Plan of Serbia introduced the idea in compliance with the Law on Regional Development and <b>statistical</b> <b>nomenclature</b> of regions NUTS 2 and districts NUTS 3 in Serbia. The functional region is understood and presented as a cluster of municipalities organized flexibly around some important project(s) with a proper (sub) regional institution in charge of spurring and realizing the same. The problem is with clustering municipalities i. e. understanding the role and meaning of it for their joint interest, with some political reasons and lack of awareness as the main reasons for that. On the other hand the list of strategic priorities has been prepared for all functional regions. The list contains projects for economic, social and ecological development. Eco-services are among the high priority issues but asking for intensive horizontal coordination and clustering a group of interested municipalities. Regional landfills, waste water purification, protected nature (high mountains) use, small rivers cleaning, are among such projects with some hot spots eliminating as paramount ones. Activating all stakeholders in the implementation phase is permanen...|$|E
40|$|The Retail and Wholesale Trade sector (NACE 51, 52 {{according}} to the European <b>Statistical</b> <b>Nomenclature)</b> traditionally is considered as a poor innovator. Innovation is seen as driven mostly by applications of information and communication technology (ICT). This report adopts a more comprehensive definition of innovation than the traditional one, taking into account both ICT-driven technological innovation and non-technological innovation. The report emphasizes the changing concept of the retail and wholesale trade sector which not just acts as a delivery channel of products to the customer, but forms {{a critical part of}} the producer value chain shaping producer business strategies. Furthermore, the sector is a provider of customer services connected with the products sold (e. g. warehousing, financial services) and embodies the client interface where customer preferences are shaped and expressed. Innovations mostly have the character of process and service innovations, for example new ways of selling, marketing, logistics and firm operations. The ongoing transformation of the sector is demonstrated by blurring distinctions between wholesale and retail, by diversity across horizontal branches, and by a diversity of organizational and strategic concepts. In this transformation, ICT (in particular e-commerce) as well as new organizational concepts fulfil an enabling role through facilitating the formation of client perceptions, desires and needs...|$|E
40|$|Resume The {{submitted}} thesis {{deals with}} customs {{as an instrument}} of custom tarrif regulation in European Union and in the Ukraine. This thesis defines in detail customs tariff regulation from prospective of financial and custom law in both legal systems. It further represents the views of the main principles of customs regulation, defines customs tarrif, its basic elements and types, and also compares legislation in the Ukraine and in European Union. The legal sources in the field of customs tarrif regulation valid for both in the Ukraine and in European Union are also stated. The main part of the work is dealing with the Community Customs Code, Code's implementing provisions (Commision Regulation No 2454 / 93), Common Customs tariff of the EU, which is the external tariff applied to products imported into the European Union, and Combined Nomenclature as the tariff and <b>statistical</b> <b>nomenclature</b> of the Customs Union. The Ukrainian Customs tariff Act and the Ukrainian Clasification of Comodities in foreign trade contain the comodity nomenclature of foreign trade. The last part of the thesis deals with value of goods and contry of origin of goods. I describe here the definition of value of goods and methods of its assessment in Ukraine and European Union. The valid law in both legislative systems use four methods [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Context: Neuropsychiatric {{systemic}} {{lupus erythematosus}} (NPSLE) has varied manifestations. Aims: To study the pattern of neuropsychiatric (NP) involvement in {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE). Settings and Design: Hospital based cross sectional and retrospective study. Patients and Methods: Patients admitted with a diagnosis of SLE, {{during a period of}} 16 months, were evaluated and any NP syndrome present classified as per the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) <b>nomenclature.</b> <b>Statistical</b> analysis: SPSS software Version 10 was used for descriptive analysis and correlative study. Results: Out of 50 patients with SLE, all the patients with NPSLE [39 (78 &#x 0025;) ] were females, mean age 25. 66 years (range: 11 - 44). The commonest manifestation was headache [20 (55. 6 &#x 0025;) ]. Seizures were seen in 8 (20. 51 &#x 0025;) and psychosis in 6 (16. 2 &#x 0025;). Fine distal tremor was seen in 8 (20. 51 &#x 0025;) of patients. Conclusions: Headache is a frequent NP syndrome.

40|$|Using {{sunshine}} duration, cloud cover, relative humidity, {{average of}} maximum temperature, and ground albedo as {{the input of}} several radiation models, the monthly average daily solar radiation on horizontal surface in various coastal cities of the South (25. 23 ∘ N) and the North (38. 42 ∘ N) of Iran are estimated. Several radiation models are tested and further are revised by taking into consideration the effects of relative humidity, ground albedo, and Sun-Earth distance. Model validation is performed by using up to 13 years (1988 – 2000) of daily solar observations. Errors are calculated using MBE, MABE, MPE, and RMSE <b>statistical</b> criteria (see <b>nomenclature)</b> and further a general formula which estimates the global radiation in different climates of coastal regions is suggested. The proposed method shows a good agreement (less than 7 % deviation) with the long-term pyranometric data. In comparison with other works done so far, the suggested method performs {{a higher degree of}} accuracy for those of two regions. The model results can be extended to other locations in coastal regions where solar data are not available...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model of damage evolution in heterogeneous materials is developed using {{the methods of}} the theory of fuzzy sets. The fuzzy concept of damage is formulated and some applications of this concept are considered. The influence of the material heterogeneity on the damage as well as the heterogenization of the material due to the damage evolution are studied. On the basis of the fuzzy concept of damage, it is shown that the greater the heterogeneity of material, the closer is the material to failure under loading. 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd H h c f i L L,cr Y' 13) <b>NOMENCLATURE</b> <b>statistical</b> entropy of the distribution of local strength of heterogeneous material crack length amount of components of different strength in the material time to failure of a body with microcrack density R membership function of a heterogeneous material into a fuzzy set of !" strength of a homogeneous material strength of i-th constituent of a material local stress critical level of the local stress membership function of a body into a fuzzy set of the behavior of destructed material membership function of a body into a complement of the fuzzy set of destructed material conditional membership function of a material (or its constituent) with a given strength into a fuzzy set of the behavior of destroyed materials. 1...|$|R
40|$|The Nomenclature that {{is governed}} by the Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonized System Convention, Brussels, 14 June 1983) has {{resulted}} in an adjustment of many nomenclatures used worldwide for statistical and customs classifi cation because nomenclatures {{that are based on}} the HS nomenclature are accepted in more than 200 countries and economic regions 2 ̆ 013 more than 98 percent of world trade is classified according to the HS nomenclature. However, only the first six digits are uniform (HS- 6), and further subdivisions are allowed if the structure of the HS nomenclature is not altered. Basically, most customs tariffs worldwide are uniform and the statistical data are comparable, which is important for economic research and comparability of economic data. However, the European Community (EC) applys a Common Customs Tariff (CCT) that is not uniform, because the EC combined <b>statistical</b> and customs <b>nomenclature</b> (so called Combined Nomenclature 2 ̆ 013 CN) allows a further subdivision of the Integrated Customs Tariff (TARIC, HS- 6 + 4) by an 11 th digit if there is a national purpose in one of the EC Member States.
