5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders at the}} fort had been given written information from the Indian Agent regarding the killings during the raid. Plans were made to arrest the Indians involved. D Troop was hidden on foot behind the main office building. Carpenter had mounted troopers waiting nearby. Sherman and Grierson <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> reviewing the situation {{and waiting for the}} Indians to arrive. When the Indians came, they blatantly boasted of what they had done. After Sherman told the Indians they were under arrest, a signal was given and the dismounted troopers came forward with carbines and pistols in hand. Lone Wolf, supporting the Kiowa Chiefs, pulled a rifle out from under his blanket serape and pointed it at Sherman. Sherman, ready for any problem, quickly disarmed him before the trigger could be pulled. Big Tree made an attempt to escape but was quickly subdued by Carpenter's mounted troopers. Sherman decided that these men were criminals to be tried in a civil court and Carpenter was told to get it done.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-June 1880, [...] "Buckskin" [...] Frank Leslie {{who had an}} eye for the ladies, escorted Mary Killen, the Commercial Hotel's housekeeper, to a dance. Accounts differ as {{to whether}} she was {{separated}} from her husband or still married to him. After the dance, they <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and were spotted by her drunken husband. Killen appeared {{out of the dark}} street and shot at Leslie, barely missing him. Leslie fired back and shot Mike Killen twice. Mike Killen died five days later and was buried in Tombstone's Boot Hill cemetery on June 22, 1880. Buckskin Frank Leslie had fired in self-defense and wasn't arrested.|$|E
60|$|She silently {{handed her}} {{purchases}} to the silent Oscarina. She <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> rocking, fanning, twitchy with Hugh's whining.|$|E
60|$|After dinner they <b>sat</b> out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> It was {{a perfect}} night. The cool dusk was soothing.|$|R
60|$|She <b>sat</b> alone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> that evening. It {{seemed that}} Kennicott {{had to make}} a {{professional}} call on Mrs. Dave Dyer.|$|R
60|$|Now, as he <b>sat</b> smoking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{first night}} of his inaugural visit to the ranch, a {{conviction}} was creeping over him that John had chosen wisely.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes she <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> {{with the}} children, while Mrs. Richards, the foreman's wife, a hearty, talkative woman, plied her with milk and cookies.|$|E
60|$|That evening Helen denied {{herself to}} Mr. Brandt {{and several other}} callers. She <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> with her father while he smoked his pipe.|$|E
60|$|Belllounds did not deign {{to reply}} to this. He <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> where evidently he had awaited her return, {{and he looked}} {{anything}} but happy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it's fine," [...] replied Slone, rather awkwardly, as he <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> step. What could Holley {{want with}} him? This old rider was above curiosity or gossip.|$|R
60|$|So {{they went}} into the back yard, and after walking along winding paths some {{distance}} through the beautiful gardens they came to an attractive little house where <b>the</b> Yellow Hen <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front <b>porch</b> sunning herself.|$|R
60|$|Our {{first evening}} {{in that house}} {{was made up of}} hours of {{unalloyed}} bliss. We walked from room to room; we looked out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> garden and <b>the</b> lawn; we <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> little <b>porch</b> while I smoked.|$|R
6000|$|She did {{not answer}} his joviality. She <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> rocked silently, then sighed, [...] "So many mosquitos out here. You haven't had the screen fixed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose {{all this}} time he is deeply thinking," [...] said Mary Louise as the girls <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> {{watching}} him, the day after their arrival, [...] "but {{it would be interesting}} to know what direction Bub's thoughts take." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Colfax, yawning, {{had taken}} a book and gone to bed. Still Virginia <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> while the frogs sang of rain, and the {{lightning}} quivered across the eastern sky. She heard the crunch of wheels in the gravel.|$|E
5000|$|Abraham Lincoln, then a {{candidate}} for {{a seat in the}} U.S. Senate, <b>sat</b> up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of his hotel in Jonesboro, Illinois, to see [...] "Donti's Comet" [...] on September 14, 1858, the night before the third of his historic debates with Stephen Douglas.|$|R
60|$|For the present, after tea, as they <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rose-framed <b>porch,</b> while Rowland {{held his}} younger cousin between his knees, and she, enjoying her situation, listened timorously for {{the stroke of}} bedtime, Cecilia insisted on talking more about her visitor than about herself.|$|R
60|$|One day Belllounds sent Columbine {{to fetch}} Moore down to White Slides. It was a warm, Indian-summer afternoon, {{and the old}} rancher <b>sat</b> out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> in his shirt-sleeves. His hair was white now, but no other change was visible in him. No {{restraint}} attended his greeting to the cowboy.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a relief}} when a sudden detour landed the machine on a cross way, leading through {{interlacing}} pepper trees, to a small but attractive bungalow. A pretty, neatly dressed young woman <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> sewing. She rose as the car stopped.|$|E
60|$|Returning from {{a hunting}} trip, I {{waited at the}} little town of Los Pinos, in New Mexico, for the south-bound train, which was one hour late. I <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of the Summit House and {{discussed}} the functions of life with Telemachus Hicks, the hotel proprietor.|$|E
60|$|The {{telegram}} came to Mason as he <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of the Herrick cottage. He read it, and {{his eyes}} smiled, but his feeling {{was not one of}} amusement. The significance of that impulsive message struck deep, and his blood responded to {{it as if it were}} an embrace.|$|E
60|$|When Euphemia came in {{from the}} poultry-yard, she called me and said she was in a hurry to hear Pomona's account of things. So I went in, and we <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side <b>porch,</b> where it was shady, while Pomona, {{producing}} some sheets of foolscap paper, took her seat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper step.|$|R
6000|$|As {{they reached}} the little one-story square cottage he <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> where <b>the</b> red light fell warmly, and romped with the children, while his wife went in and took off her things. She [...] "kept a girl" [...] now, so {{that the work of}} getting supper did not devolve entirely upon her. She came out soon to call them all to the supper table in the little kitchen back of the sitting room.|$|R
60|$|The {{first to}} arrive, however, was an uninvited guest, for just as Bab and Betty <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> steps, in their stiff pink calico frocks and white ruffled aprons, to repose {{a moment before}} the party came in, a {{rustling}} was heard among the lilacs, and out stepped Alfred Tennyson Barlow, looking like a small Robin Hood, in a green blouse with a silver buckle on his broad belt, a feather in his little cap and a bow in his hand.|$|R
60|$|And {{getting out}} {{a horse and}} buckboard, she drove over to Oak Run and to the Smiths' place. She found no crape on the door. Harry Smith <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> his arm in a sling. Plucking up courage she drew rein, dismounted, and {{walked up to the}} boy, {{who was one of the}} Rover {{brothers}} friends.|$|E
6000|$|... "And how do {{you like}} your grandfather? Is he good to you?" [...] asked Mrs. Scammel on Sunday forenoon, as she <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> beside her small daughter. Old Swallowtail did not usually go to his office on Sundays, but kept his room at the cottage and wrote letters. To-day, however, he had wandered down the path and disappeared, and Nan and Ingua were both glad to see him go.|$|E
60|$|Ames was the king-pin, the snowy-petalled Marguerite, the star-bright looloo of the rewrite men. He saw {{attempted}} {{murder in the}} pains of green-apple colic, cyclones in the summer zephyr, lost children in every top-spinning urchin, an uprising of the down-trodden masses in every hurling of a derelict potato at a passing automobile. When not rewriting, Ames <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> of his Brooklyn villa playing checkers with his ten-year-old son.|$|E
60|$|Every {{night in}} the dark he went to Mary's home and <b>sat</b> with her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> He never went inside. For all he knew, his visits were unknown to her neighbors. Still, {{it did not matter}} to him if they found out. To her he could talk as he had never talked to any one. She liberated all his thought and fancy. He filled her mind.|$|R
50|$|However, {{less than}} a month after the acquittal, Yarberry killed again. On June 18, 1881, Yarberry <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front <b>porch</b> of his friend Elwood Maden's home, conversing with gambler Monte Frank Boyd. As they talked, a shot was heard coming from the {{direction}} of the R.H. Greenleaf Restaurant, and both Yarberry and Boyd ran to that location. What happened next is confusing, as no one was quite certain. Yarberry asked a bystander who fired the shot, to which the bystander indicated by pointing at a man who was walking away. Yarberry called to him, telling him to halt, he wanted to speak with him. Within seconds, three shots were fired, and Charles D. Campbell lay dead.|$|R
60|$|Therefore, Lane went {{early to}} the Iden homestead, a picturesque cottage {{across the river}} from Riverside Park. The only change Lane noted was a larger growth of trees and a fuller foliage. It was warm twilight. The frogs had begun to trill, sweet and melodious sound to Lane, {{striking}} melancholy chords of memory. Joshua Iden was walking on his lawn, his coat off, his gray head uncovered. Mrs. Iden <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> low-roofed <b>porch.</b> Lane expected to see a sad change in her, something the same as he had found in his own mother. But he was hardly prepared for the frail, white-haired woman unlike the image he carried in his mind.|$|R
60|$|Duane {{remained}} all {{day with}} this hospitable Jones, and as twilight fell was loath to go and yielded to a pressing invitation to remain overnight. It was seldom indeed that Duane slept under a roof. Early in the evening, while Duane <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> with two awed and hero-worshiping sons of the house, Jones returned from a quick visit down to the post-office. Summarily he sent the boys off. He labored under intense excitement.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Major had a {{bungalow}} {{so close}} on the sea that the nine-inch tide seeped through {{the cracks in the}} kitchen floor. Me and him and High Jack Snakefeeder <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> and drank rum from noon till midnight. He said he had piled up $300,000 in New Orleans banks, and High and me could stay with him forever if we would. But High Jack happened to think of the United States, and began to talk ethnology.|$|E
60|$|One summer evening, four or {{five years}} later, the Rev. J. Gruber, of Norton, and a Maysville {{attorney}} named Hyatt met on horseback in front of the Harding place. Having business matters to discuss, they hitched their animals and going to the house <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> to talk. Some humorous reference to the somber reputation of the place was made and forgotten as soon as uttered, and they talked of their business affairs until it grew almost dark. The evening was oppressively warm, the air stagnant.|$|E
50|$|Late in {{the evening}} of June 22, 1880, Leslie had his arm around May as they <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front <b>porch</b> of <b>the</b> Cosmopolitan Hotel. George M. Perine, a friend of Leslie's, saw her husband {{approaching}} and warned Leslie, but not before Killeen fired his gun twice. The bullets grazed Leslie's head and stunned him. Killeen attacked Leslie and began clubbing him with his revolver when Killeen was shot and mortally wounded. Before he died five days later on June 28, he told E.T. Packwood that Perine had shot him. Both Leslie and Perine were charged with murder but Leslie claimed he had fired in self-defense and that Perine had not fired his weapon. The court accepted Leslie's explanation and dismissed charges against both men.|$|R
5000|$|At {{approximately}} 12:38 p.m. (PST), {{minutes after}} returning to his bedroom, Gay Sr. {{came back to the}} bedroom with the [...]38 pistol and shot his son. The bullet penetrated Marvin's vital organs, including his heart. Gay Sr. then walked forward and shot him a second time in the shoulder at point-blank range. According to his daughter-in-law, Irene, Gay Sr. hid the gun in his bedroom pillow, and she later retrieved it for the police. Gay then went outside and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front <b>porch</b> and awaited his arrest, which came after police discovered Marvin's body and confirmed that Gay had shot his son. Marvin Gaye Jr.'s body was later taken to California Hospital Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 1:01 pm PST.|$|R
6000|$|It was noon before Milt and Claire woke, and {{discovered}} that Dlorus had prepared for them scrambled eggs and store celery, served on an almost clean table-cloth. Mr. Kloh came home for lunch, and while Dlorus <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> his lap in the living-room, and repeated {{that she had been}} a [...] "bad, naughty, 'ittle dirl--what did the fellows say at the mill?" [...] Milt and Claire <b>sat</b> dumpily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back <b>porch,</b> regarding scenery which featured of seven tin cans, a broken patent washing-machine, and a rheumatic pear tree.|$|R
