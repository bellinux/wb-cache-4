50|$|In {{some cases}} the <b>switch</b> <b>blades</b> can be heat treated for {{improvement}} of their service life. There are different kinds of heat treatment processes such as edge hardening or complete hardening.|$|R
50|$|Catch points may {{consist of}} a full turnout or a single <b>switch</b> <b>blade.</b> In some cases, on a track that is only traversed by uphill traffic, {{trailing}} point blades are held {{in a position to}} derail any vehicle travelling downhill. However, any traffic travelling in the correct (uphill) direction can pass over the turnout safely, pushing the <b>switch</b> <b>blades</b> into the appropriate position. Once the wheels have passed, the catch points are forced back into the derailing position by springs. In these cases, a lever may be provided to temporarily override the catch points and allow safe passage down the gradient in certain controlled circumstances.|$|R
50|$|Turnouts were {{originally}} built with straight <b>switch</b> <b>blades,</b> which ended at the pointed {{end with a}} sharp angle. These switches cause a bump when the train traverses in the turnout direction. The <b>switch</b> <b>blades</b> could be made with a curved point which meets the stockrail at a tangent, causing less of a bump, but the disadvantage is that the metal at the point is thin and necessarily weak. A solution to these conflicting requirements {{was found in the}} 1920s on the German Reichsbahn. The first step was to have different rail profile for the stock rails and switch rails, with the switch rails being about 25 mm less high, and stockier in the middle.|$|R
5000|$|Modern point {{machines}} have {{an electric}} motor and gears to convert the rotational motion of the motor into the linear motion required to switch the points.

50|$|The {{tracks are}} partly on slab track (Rheda-Dywidag system). The two {{turnouts}} at Breckenheim junction are each 138 m long and weigh 500 tons, allowing branching speeds {{of up to}} 160 km/h (4,000 m radius). The <b>switch</b> <b>blades</b> are 54 metres long. It is the largest turnout on the whole Cologne-Rhine/Main high-speed line project.|$|R

50|$|A single {{versatile}} Service Engine frame {{consists of}} three shelves, each shelf having three slots A single slot can have many sub-slots staging a blade in it. ATCA blades can be processors, Switches, AMC carriers, etc. A typical shelf will contain one or more <b>switch</b> <b>blades</b> and several processor blades.The power supply and cooling fans {{are located in the}} backpane of the VSE.|$|R
50|$|An outside {{slip switch}} {{is similar to}} the double or single slip {{switches}} described above, except that the <b>switch</b> <b>blades</b> are outside of the diamond instead of inside. An advantage over an inside slip switch is that trains can pass the slips with higher speeds. A disadvantage over an inside slip switch is that they are longer and need more space.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of the derailment, Norfolk Southern train 703 {{approached}} the <b>spring</b> <b>switch</b> at the west end of the Boyd Siding and was given a signal restriction. The crew of 703 stopped in the siding and examined the <b>spring</b> <b>switch</b> at the east end of the siding, noting a 1/4-inch gap was present between the switch point and the stock rail. The crew manually operated the switch several times and noted that the switch still had a small 1/8-inch gap. The 703 engineer radioed Norfolk Southern dispatch to report the issue. Train 703 then proceeded through the switch without incident.|$|R
50|$|Earthed, 16 A, polarized. This coupler is {{used for}} some IT {{applications}} where higher currents are required, as for instance, on high-power workstations and servers, uninterruptible power supplies, power distribution units, large network routers, <b>switches,</b> <b>blade</b> enclosures, and similar equipment. This connector {{can also be found}} on high current medical equipment. It is rectangular and has pins parallel to the long axis of the coupler face.|$|R
50|$|Joints {{are used}} where the moving points meet the fixed rails of the switch. They allow the points to hinge easily between their positions. Originally the movable <b>switch</b> <b>blades</b> were {{connected}} to the fixed closure rails with loose joints, but since steel rails are somewhat flexible {{it is possible to}} make this join by thinning a short section of the rail itself. This can be called a heelless switch.|$|R
50|$|The {{divergence}} {{and length}} of a switch {{is determined by the}} angle of the frog (the point in the switch where two rails cross, see below) and the angle or curvature of the <b>switch</b> <b>blades.</b> The length and placement of the other components are determined from this using established formulas and standards. This divergence is measured as the number of units of length for a single unit of separation.|$|R

50|$|Host-based write {{splitting}} is done using {{a device}} driver that is {{installed on the}} server accessing the storage volumes. The usage of a host-based splitter allows replication of selected non-EMC storage. Available fabric-based splitters are for Brocade Communications Systems SAN switches and for Cisco Systems SANTap. This requires the investment in additional <b>switch</b> <b>blades.</b> This configuration allows splitting from all operating systems regardless of their version, and is agnostic to the storage array vendor.|$|R
50|$|The {{right-hand}} diagram shows a how a tangential turnout is made. A lower, more squat {{profile rail}} {{is used to}} make the <b>switch</b> <b>blades.</b> On the left is the profile of this squat switch rail. The centre diagram shows how the switch rail has to be planed, and on the right it is shown fitting against the stock rail. Note that a thicker base is used to raise the tops level with each other.|$|R
50|$|Such {{switches}} {{are usually}} implemented {{on the basis}} of increasing the safe crossing speed. Open blades impose a speed restriction, due to the potential of the crossing impact fracturing the rail as both wheels on each axle hit the crossing gaps almost simultaneously. <b>Switched</b> <b>blades,</b> as shown in the photograph, allow a much higher speed across the gap by providing an essentially continuous piece of rail across the gap on both sides.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom {{points and}} {{crossings}} using chaired bullhead rail would be referred to using a letter and number combination. The letter would define the length (and hence the radius) of the <b>switch</b> <b>blades</b> and the number would define {{the angle of the}} crossing (frog). Thus an A7 turnout would be very short and likely only to be found in tight places like dockyards whereas an E12 would be found as a fairly high speed turnout on a mainline.|$|R
50|$|Digital {{television}} transmissions have commenced in Alice Springs. New channels {{provided by}} the ABC and SBS can be received with a digital set top box or digital television. Additional channels from the commercial broadcasters that are available in most other areas of Australia are expected to commence transmission in 2011-2012. Analogue television transmissions in Alice <b>Springs</b> <b>switched</b> off on 31 December 2013.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tangential}} {{switch rail}} has less steel planed away, and the mid {{part of the}} switch [...] "scallops" [...] into the web of the stock rail for greater strength. The higher baseplate also supports the switch rail better. This makes a stronger switch which can be curved, reducing the jolt to the train and allowing higher speeds. However tangential turnouts still lack a smooth transition where the <b>switch</b> <b>blade</b> contacts the main rail, so {{there is still some}} jolt as the train passes over, though it is a much smaller jolt than with the old-style turnouts.|$|R
50|$|In a trailing-point {{movement}} (running {{through the}} switch {{in the wrong}} direction while they are set to turn off the track), the flanges on the wheels will force the points to the proper position. This is sometimes known as running through the switch. Some switches are designed to be forced to the proper position without damage. Examples include variable <b>switches,</b> <b>spring</b> <b>switches,</b> and weighted switches.|$|R
25|$|The Model M is {{also less}} {{susceptible}} to dirt and wear. Dirt can interfere with the proper operation of most other keyboard technologies; however, the buckling <b>spring</b> <b>switch's</b> design is such that any dirt that falls between the keys is unlikely to enter the switch mechanism, which is covered by the key. Even if dirt were to enter a mechanism, a large amount {{would be necessary to}} prevent it from operating.|$|R
40|$|A dual {{measurement}} ablation sensor {{for measuring}} both char-interface and surface recession {{at a point}} in an ablating material is described. The sensor permits measurement of the thickness of the char layer. Char-interface recession is indicated by a drop in the resistance to a current passed through the ablation material. Surface recession is indicated by the closing of an electrical circuit when melting causes the release of a <b>spring</b> <b>switch...</b>|$|R

5000|$|A {{maintenance}} {{person was}} sent to investigate the report, arriving at the site around 11:00 AM EDT. He observed that the signals were clear and that the <b>spring</b> <b>switch</b> appeared to be properly aligned against the rail, likely having completely closed after train 703 passed through the switch earlier. The signal maintainer later told investigators that he felt the switch [...] "looked like it {{could use a little}} oil".|$|R
50|$|For {{turnouts}} (BrE: points), {{the tips}} of the <b>switch</b> <b>blades</b> have to be planed down to fit snugly against the fixed or stock rail. The left-hand diagram shows this: on the left is the dotted outline of the rail, with the part remaining after planing-shown shown by a solid line in red. On the right is shown how the two rails fit together when the turnout is closed. The resulting thin pieces of steel are weak, and so old-style turnouts used to make a relatively sudden and sharp angle against the stock rail. With a sudden change in direction, trains were given a jolt and had to proceed slowly.|$|R

[...] "Oh, it is a knife", says Jemaine, then they both run away. This is a {{reference}} to the famous scene in the 1986 Australian film, Crocodile Dundee, in which Mick Dundee is accosted by a mugger on his first visit to New York. The would-be mugger threatens him with a <b>switch</b> <b>blade.</b> Dundee says [...] "that's not a knife", then pulls out his own knife, a large Bowie, and says [...] "that's a knife", causing the mugger to flee.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Rigid multibody {{dynamics}} with {{friction and}} impact are ill-posed. The rigidity assumption can {{be responsible for}} large null-spaces. By describing the multibody system with <b>springs</b> <b>switching</b> on and off in a variational inequality setting, the solutions are smooth and the behaviour in the stiff limit can be analyzed. From the limiting process it becomes apparent that the regularized solution converges to a unique weighted minimum norm solution of the unregularized problem...|$|R
