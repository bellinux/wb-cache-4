40|$|AbstractDairy calves in {{the western}} United States are {{commonly}} raised individually in wooden hutches with a <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> of 1. 23 m 2 /calf. Recent legislative initiatives in California and across the United States were passed regarding concern over <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> for farm animals. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if rearing male Holstein calves in wooden hutches modified to increase <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> would influence measures of performance, lying time per day, health, and respiratory immunocompetence. At 4 d of age, 60 calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 housing treatments: (1) conventional housing (CONV; 1. 23 m 2 /calf), (2) 1. 5 × CONV (MOD; 1. 85 m 2 /calf), or (3) 3 × CONV (MAX; 3. 71 m 2 /calf). Intakes of milk and solid feed were recorded daily and body weight was measured at 0, 3, 6, 10, and 12 wk of age. For the first 3 wk of the trial, calves were scored daily for fecal consistency, hydration, and hide cleanliness. In addition, calves were scored for respiratory health (i. e., nasal and eye discharge, ear position) until 7 wk of age. The total lying duration per day was recorded using data loggers at 3, 6, and 10 wk of age. Eight clinically healthy calves from each treatment were sensitized with subcutaneous ovalbumin (OVA) and then challenged with aerosolized OVA to assess calf respiratory immunity at 11 wk of age. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected 4 d after the OVA challenge and analyzed for leukocyte differentials and OVA-specific IgG, IgG 1, IgA, and IgE. Calf average daily gain and body weight were positively associated with <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> at approximately 3 wk before weaning and throughout postweaning, respectively. A greater <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> decreased lying time after 46 d. <b>Space</b> <b>allowance</b> did not influence fecal consistency, but there was a tendency for MAX calves to take 1 d longer to recover from loose feces than MOD calves. The MAX calves had the fewest (%) observations with feces on their body compared with CONV or MOD. At 3 wk of age, peripheral eosinophil concentrations decreased with increased <b>space</b> <b>allowance.</b> However, observations (%) of eye discharge increased with greater <b>space</b> <b>allowance.</b> Among calves challenged with OVA, MOD calves had the least BALF OVA-IgE, and the percent of BALF eosinophils decreased with increased <b>space</b> <b>allowance.</b> Increased <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> for calves raised in wooden hutches may improve some measures of calf performance, health, and respiratory immunocompetence...|$|R
40|$|Objective This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the optimal <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> on growth performance, blood profile and pork quality of growing-finishing pigs. Methods A total of ninety crossbred pigs [(Yorkshire×Landrace) ×Duroc, 30. 25 ± 1. 13 kg] were allocated into three treatments (0. 96 : four pigs/pen, 0. 96 m 2 /pig; 0. 80 : five pigs/pen, 0. 80 m 2 /pig; 0. 69 : six pigs/pen, 0. 69 m 2 /pig) in a randomized complete block design. Pigs were housed in balanced sex and had free access to feed in all phases for 14 weeks (growing phase I, growing phase II, finishing phase I, and finishing phase II). Results There was no statistical difference in growing phase, but a linear decrease was observed on average daily gain (ADG, p< 0. 01), average daily feed intake (ADFI, p< 0. 01), and body weight (BW, p< 0. 01) with decreasing <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> in late finishing phase. On the other hand, a quadratic effect was observed on gain to feed ratio in early finishing phase (p< 0. 03). Consequently, overall ADG, ADFI, and final BW linearly declined in response to decreased <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> (p< 0. 01). The pH of pork had {{no significant difference in}} 1 hour after slaughter, whereas there was a linear decrease in 24 h after slaughter with decreasing <b>space</b> <b>allowance.</b> Floor area allowance did not affect pork colors, but shear force linearly increased as floor space decreased (p< 0. 01). There was a linear increase in serum cortisol concentration on 14 week (p< 0. 05) with decreased space allocation. Serum IgG was linearly ameliorated as <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> increased on 10 week (p< 0. 05) and 14 week (p< 0. 01).

40|$|ABSTRACT Energy {{requirements}} for brooding chickens {{can be reduced}} by restricting the growing area during the 4 -week brooding period. Since use of the live weight of chickens per unit of floor area is not a suitable method of establishing the space {{requirements for}} the brooding period, it was postulated that a reliable criterion might be live weight per unit of volume actually occupied by the chickens. Data were obtained which relate broiler chicken height and body weight from 1 day to 8 weeks of age. These data were found to fit the parabolic equation W = 0. 098 H 3 " 3, where W is body weight and H is standing height of the chicken.

40|$|The {{amount of}} space {{provided}} to animals governs important elements of their behaviour and, hence, is critical for their health and welfare. We review the use of allometric principles and equations to estimate the static space requirements of animals when standing and lying, and the space required for animals to feed, drink, stand-up and lie-down. We use the research literature relating to transportation and intensive housing of sheep and cattle to assess the validity of allometric equations for estimating <b>space</b> <b>allowances.</b> We investigated these areas because transportation and intensive housing provide points along a continuum {{in terms of the}} duration of confinement, (from hours to months) and spatial requirements are likely to increase with increasing duration of confinement, as animals will need to perform a greater behavioural repertoire for long-term survival, health and welfare. We find that, although there are theoretical reasons why allometric relationships to <b>space</b> <b>allowances</b> may vary slightly for different classes of stock, <b>space</b> <b>allowances</b> that have been demonstrated to have adverse effects on animal welfare during transportation correlated well with an inability to accommodate standing animals, as estimated from allometry. For intensive housing, we were able to detect a space allowance below which there were adverse effects on welfare. For short duration transportation during which animals remain standing, a space allowance per animal described by the allometric equation: area (m) = 0. 020 W, where W = liveweight (kg), would appear to be appropriate. Where it is desirable for all animals to lie simultaneously, then a minimum space allowance per animal described by the allometric equation: area (m) = 0. 027 W appears to permit this, given that animals in a group time-share space. However, there are insufficient data to determine whether this allowance onboard a vehicle/vessel would enable animals to move and access food and water with ease. In intensive housing systems, a minimum space allowance per animal described by the allometric equation: area (m) = 0. 033 W appears to be the threshold below which there are adverse effects on welfare. These suggested <b>space</b> <b>allowances</b> require verification with a range of species under different thermal conditions and, for transportation, under different conditions of vehicular/vessel stability. The minimum length of trough per animal (L in m) required for feeding and drinking can be determined from L = 0. 064 W, with the number of animals required to feed/drink simultaneously taken into account, together with any requirement to minimise competition. This also requires verification with a range of species. We conclude that allometric relationships are an appropriate basis for the formulation of <b>space</b> <b>allowances</b> for livestock.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to assess the}} effect of feed area design including feeding space availability, barrier type and stocking density, on the feeding behaviour of dairy cows. Feed intake in dairy cows is directly related to milk production, thus a good food supply is extremely important to the modern, high producing dairy cow. Intake is critical for improving milk production, health, body condition and the welfare of the animals. Feeding designs can have a major effect on behaviour and feed intake, therefore it is an important consideration when housing cattle and other livestock. The effect of altering the amount of space allowance available at the feed-face highlighted a significant effect on feeding patterns. As the space allowance increased the number of feeding bouts also increased (P< 0. 001) and length of bouts decreased (P< 0. 05). However, when provided with extra space at the feed-face, cows did not increase their feed intake as hypothesised, possibly {{as a result of the}} differences between individual animals being masked by an overall group effect. The number of aggressive interactions decreased as the space allowance increased (P< 0. 001) and furthermore, the number of times individuals were displaced from the feeding area also decreased as the space allowance increased (P< 0. 05). Subsequently, preference tests were used as a behavioural tool to determine how individual cows perceive their feeding environment with specific emphasis on understanding what difficulties low ranking animals face at the feed-face. Subordinate cows showed a significant preference for feeding alone rather than next to a dominant when they were offered high quality feed on both sides of a Y-maze test (P< 0. 001). When “asked” to trade-off between feed quality and proximity to a dominant cow, subordinate cows chose to feed alone on low quality food. A follow-on experiment using the same methodology was undertaken and aimed to identify the <b>space</b> <b>allowances</b> at which cows would not trade-off food quality. Four different <b>space</b> <b>allowances</b> were tested. At the two smaller <b>space</b> <b>allowances,</b> cows preferred to feed alone and for the two larger <b>space</b> <b>allowances,</b> cows had no significant preferences. The feed barrier has been shown to have a major effect on feeding and social behaviour of group housed dairy cows. A barrier design that provides some sort of separation between cows has also been shown to reduce competition. The aim of the final study was to determine if a feed barrier which obscured the cows’ visual field whilst feeding would increase vigilance behaviour and alter normal feeding behaviour, particularly for subordinates. Two different types of feed barrier were tested at four different stocking densities. The average daily feeding time was higher when cows were fed using a conventional headlock system compared to an electronic feeding system (P< 0. 05). All groups of cows displayed vigilance scans, however, neither type of barrier, feed space allowance, or dominance rank had an effect on the frequency of scans. These results indicate that neither feeder design nor stocking rate affect vigilance in dairy cows, at least over the treatment conditions assessed in the current study. The results of this research illustrate that to achieve the maximum levels of feeding behaviour and a reduction of aggressive behaviour, the cows’ environment must be such that it provides sufficient space and feed barrier design which will allow normal social behaviour.

40|$|Many goat kids (Capra aegagrus hircus) are transported {{live from}} The Netherlands for {{slaughter}} in France or Spain. Current standards indicate that goats (< 35 kg) should have sufficient space at 0. 2 – 0. 30 m 2 per animal (approximately 5 goats per m 2). Research was devised to assess behaviour and physiological responses of goat kids transported at different <b>space</b> <b>allowances.</b> After weaning, goat kids were fed milk {{for six weeks}} using a lambar-type feeder and then transported to Spain circa 1, 400 km). These kids (8 – 10 kg, maximum eight weeks old) were transported at <b>space</b> <b>allowances</b> of 0. 2, 0. 13 and 0. 1 m 2 per animal (ie loading densities 5, 7. 5 or 10 animals per m 2, respectively) in three journeys. Before loading and upon arrival, six goats per compartment were weighed, blood sampled and had rectal temperature measured. Three goats per compartment were equipped with ECG loggers. On average, kids lost approximately 4 % in bodyweight and rectal temperature fell 0. 2 °C during 20 h transport. Heart rate ranged between 100 – 190 bpm irrespective of loading density during actual transport. All animals stood at the beginning but were never all recumbent independent of loading density. Kids tended to huddle together at lower loading densities. High loading density restricted movement. Blood concentrations of haemoglobin and haematocrit increased, as did osmolality indicating dehydration. It is recommended that water be supplied using a drinking system to which animals are accustomed. Since movement was restricted {{it is recommended that}} kids be transported at nine animals per m 2 (maximum) ...|$|E

40|$|To {{prove the}} meaningfulness of design {{criteria}} {{in relation to}} claw disorder and mortality of fattening bulls a cohort analysis was carried out on 50 farms with housing systems characterised by fully slatted floor, deep litter or litter+concrete floor. Hoofs of the bulls were collected after slaughtering and examined for pathological findings. <b>Space</b> <b>allowance,</b> feeding <b>space,</b> pen depth {{and quality of the}} floor were integrated into a TGI- 40 protocol and related to the incidence of early losses. Slatted floor pens were characterised by a low <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> and a low pen depth. In contrast, dimensions of pens with deep litter and litter+concrete floor were clearly larger but showed a wide and overlapping variation in the different design criteria. Hoofs on animals from deep litter and litter+concrete floor were in a worse condition than hoofs on animals from fully slatted floor. Early and total animal losses were higher in slatted floor than in litter systems. Early losses correlated significantly with the scores of the TGI- 40 protocol (r=- 0. 31).

40|$|Group size (GS) and <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> {{have major}} {{implications}} {{for the welfare of}} production species, however their effects are often confounded. In a previous study we investigated the impact of varying <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> at constant GS. In the present work we report the consequences of varying GS on pregnant ewes while controlling <b>space</b> <b>allowance.</b> We housed ewes at 6 (GS 6) or 12 ewes/enclosure (GS 12), while controlling <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> to 1. 5 m 2 /ewe (3 enclosures/treatment), and necessarily varying enclosure size. Therefore, when indicating GS effects we implicitly reflect a confounding effect with that of enclosure size. Movement, use of space, behaviour, serum cortisol concentration and body condition score (BCS) were collected during the last 12 gestation weeks. Movement, use of space, and behaviour were collected every other week, during 2 days/week, using 10 minute continuous scan samplings. Blood was collected during weeks 10, 13, 17, and 21 of gestation, and BCS during weeks 15 and 21. Data were analysed using repeated measures, generalized linear mixed models, with GS, week, and their interaction as fixed effects, and enclosure as random effect. GS mainly affected movement and use of space. GS 12 ewes walked longer distances using longer steps (P< 0. 001). An interaction GS by week was observed for angular dispersion (P< 0. 0001), which was smaller for GS 12 from week 10 onwards. Initial restlessness levels were lower for GS 12, as shown by the reduced frequency of location changes (P< 0. 0001). Furthest and mean neighbour distances increased with GS (P< 0. 0001). The effect of GS on behaviour was only evident for eating behaviour as an interaction with gestation week (P< 0. 05). Changes in behaviour, movement and use of space along the study indicated an activity peak during weeks 3 to 5. Cortisol changes during gestation (P< 0. 01) also reflected this activity peak, while BCS (P< 0. 001) reflected normal physical condition changes during pregnancy. Although the separate effects of GS and enclosure size cannot be disentangled, we conclude that if enough space/ewe is given during gestation, larger GS will result in larger effective space, and no major {{implications for the}} welfare of ewes should be expected as GS increases. Ewes will adapt their movement patterns and use of space to enclosure size, and no further behavioural, physiological and physical consequences should be expected...|$|R
40|$|Many {{aspects of}} the {{conditions}} required to maximize the ewe's response to ram introduction in the late anoestrous season remain unclear. The aim {{of this research was}} to determine whether grazing <b>space</b> <b>allowances</b> could influence the efficacy of the ram effect. In August 1995, at Reading (latitude 51 degrees 27 'N), following a 3 -month isolation period from rams, two groups of nulliparous Mule ewes, aged 15 months, were introduced to four rains in a low (12 ewes/ha; treatment L, n = 124) or in a high stocking rate (84 ewes/ha; treatment H, n = 126). From the beginning of August until the end of August oestrous behaviour was recorded by daily checks of mating marks on ewes. Rams were removed and in October all ewes were scanned (day 50) for pregnancy. No significant differences were found in the parameters investigated. Eighty-two percent of the L and 75. 4 % of the H ewes exhibited oestrus, with a pronounced peak on day 23 following ram introduction and a compact concentration in the 21 - 25 -day period. The oestrous synchronisation rate in this 5 -day period was 69. 4 and 68. 3 %, respectively for L and H. The mean interval from ram introduction to oestrus was 23. 17 +/- 2. 4 days in L and 23. 0 +/- 2. 2 days in the H group. Conception rates were 84. 3 and 87. 4 % for L and H groups, respectively. These results suggest that the response of anoestrous ewes to the introduction of rams was not affected by grazing <b>space</b> <b>allowances</b> and that yearling Mule ewes respond well to the ram effect in the late anoestrus season.

40|$|Two {{studies were}} carried out on the same group of pigs within a {{commercial}} wean-finish system. For the nursery phase, a completely randomized design was used to compare 3 feeder space allowance treatments (2. 1, 2. 5, 2. 9 cm/pig). Pigs (n = 3, 720) were randomly allotted to same sex pens (10 feeders/ treatment) of 62 pigs/pen. Thirty 7 -hole double sided feeders were utilized in the study. All pigs had equal floor space (0. 85 m²/pig).

40|$|Growth performance, behaviour, cleanliness, carcass {{traits and}} meat quality of 48 Simmental young bulls housed on slatted floor or on straw bedding {{with the same}} <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> were {{compared}} in the study, which lasted 250 days. The animals (initial body weight = 321. 2 ± 34. 1 kg) were assigned to 8 balanced groups, according to their initial body weight. All the groups were reared in separate pens with a <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> of 3 m 2 /head. Four pens had a concrete floor covered with a straw bedding while the other pens had a fully slatted floor made of concrete slats. All the animals received the same diet provided ad libitum. Type of floor {{did not affect the}} bulls’ daily gain, feed intake and feed efficiency. Health status of the animals was satisfactory throughout the trial and several blood indicators of chronic stress were not modified by the treatment. Behavioural observations carried out at d 10, 80, 180 and 240 showed differences only on some behaviours due to the type of floor. In particular, the straw bedding increased eating behaviour and it encouraged the simultaneous presence of more bulls at the manger. Regardless of the type of floor, the progress of the trial showed a linear increase of animals’ inactivity (P results can be referred to the growth of the animal body frame, which made the <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> progressively limiting. In the straw bedded pens, clean straw was added weekly and fully renewed every 3 weeks, but this bedding management did not allow a satisfactory cleanliness of the animals in comparison with the slatted floor. However, the worse cleanliness of the bulls on the straw did not promote their grooming activity. Young bulls were slaughtered at a final weight of 614. 6 ± 14. 7 kg and their carcass traits and meat quality were not affected by the treatment. The straw bedded system cannot always be considered the cleanest solution for the housing of beef cattle and its frequent renewal must be carried out, particularly when animals are kept with a minimum <b>space</b> <b>allowance.</b> The minimal differences observed for all the parameters measured in the study between the two types of floors must be related to the adoption of the same space allowance/animal and this factor has shown to be the most critical housing parameter affecting beef cattle welfare during the fattening period...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 228 {{crossbred}} pigs {{were used to}} investigate the effect of gender (gilts and barrows), density at housing (0. 84 and 0. 76 m 2 /pig) and the interaction on growth performance and carcass and merit from 19. 4 to 110 kg body weight. Feed intake of gilts increased as the <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> decreased but no effect was observed in barrows (p< 0. 05 for the interaction). However, no interaction was observed for average daily gain or feed-to-gain ratio. Barrows had 2. 4 % less (p< 0. 01) carcass lean percentage but 9 % more (p< 0. 05) intramuscular fat content than gilts. The concentration of linoleic acid in the outer layer of backfat was higher (p< 0. 05) for gilts than for barrows when pigs were allocated at 0. 84 m 2 /pig, but no differences were observed at 0. 76 m 2 /pig. Also, barrows had 2. 7 % more (p< 0. 05) total saturated fatty acids (SFA) in the outer layer of backfat and lower monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (p< 0. 01) and linoleic acid (p< 0. 05) content in the inner layer than gilts. Housing density did not affect any of the carcass quality traits studied but an increase in <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> decreased (p< 0. 05) MUFA content in both layers. Pigs allocated at 0. 84 m 2 /pig tended (p< 0. 10) to have higher SFA content in the inner layer than pigs allocated at 0. 76 m 2 /pig. We concluded that gilts and barrows respond differently to space allocation in respect to feed intake and unsaturation of backfat.

40|$|To obtain {{quantitative}} {{information that can}} be later used in animal welfare modelling, the relationship between the lying behaviour of growing-finishing pigs (initial body weight (BW) between 19 and 87 kg) and different factors related to the housing conditions, with a potential negative effect on their welfare, was studied by means of a meta-analytical approach. Data from 22 experiments reported in 21 scientific publications were collected. The <b>space</b> <b>allowance,</b> expressed on an allometric basis by means of a k-value (m 2 /BW 0. 667), the group size (n) and the floor characteristics (fully and partly slatted v. non-slatted floor), as well as their significant two-way interactions were used as fixed effects, and the experiment was used as a random factor {{to take into account the}} interexperiment effect. Further regression analyses were performed on the predicted values of observations in order to improve the adjustment of data. A significant quadratic relationship was established between <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> (k-value, P < 0. 05; squared k-value, P < 0. 01) and the percentage of time spent lying. A significant interaction between the k-value and the floor type was also found (P < 0. 05), showing that the relationship between <b>space</b> <b>allowance</b> and lying behaviour is affected by the presence or absence of slats. Threshold k-values were obtained using broken-line analyses, being about 0. 039 for slatted floors and almost double for non-slatted floors. Compared to other studies, these values suggest that the ability to rest as space availability decreases may be compromised before a reduced performance becomes apparent. Group size did not show a significant effect. Additional information should be added to the model, as further data become available, to adjust the proposed parameters as well as to try to include the effect of other important aspects such as that of ambient temperature...|$|R
