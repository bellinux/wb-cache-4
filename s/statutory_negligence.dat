50|$|Tedla v. Ellman (280 N.Y. 124, 19 N.E. 2d 987) was a 1939 New York Court of Appeals {{case that}} was {{influential}} in establishing the bounds of the negligence per se doctrine. Ordinarily, a <b>statutory</b> violation constitutes <b>negligence.</b> However, the court, in an opinion written by Irving Lehman, instead held that because this violation occurred in a situation not anticipated by the drafters of the statute and was {{in keeping with the}} spirit of the statute, it did not constitute negligence.|$|R

50|$|X {{and others}} (minors) v Bedfordshire County Council 1995 3 All ER 353 {{was a series}} of five linked appeals which reached the House of Lords in 1995. The case is an {{important}} authority relating to Administrative liability in English Law.The cases concerned claims for personal injury arising out of a <b>statutory</b> duty and <b>negligence</b> by Bedfordshire County Council. It was claimed that the claimants had suffered parental neglect and abuse which the Council had known about, but, which the Council had failed to prevent this abuse. The Council successfully argued that they didn't owe a duty to the claimants because of the potential floodgates that this would open to future cases.|$|R
40|$|Judges have a {{tendency}} to be more demanding than regulators. In the United States, a majority of the courts has adopted the rule that the unexcused violation of a <b>statutory</b> standard is <b>negligence</b> per se. However, the converse does not hold: compliance with regulation does not relieve the injurer of tort liability. In most European legal systems, the outcome is similar. We use a framework in which, on the one hand, the effects of tort law are undermined by insolvency and evidence problems and, on the other hand, regulation is expensive in terms of monitoring and information gathering. We show that a regulatory standard set below the socially optimal level of care can be sufficient to remove the shortcomings of tort law. In essence, this is because the injurerâ€™s cost function may have two local minima that make only major deviations from the socially desirable level of precaution advantageous for the injurer, but not minor violations. This may occur when precaution also or only reduces the magnitude of the harm and under liability for negligence. Thus, minimum regulation can completely restore optimal liability incentives. Conversely, liability reduces the cost of enforcing regulation in two ways: first, enforcing minimum regulation rather than a standard set at the socially optimal level is cheaper because it requires lower monitoring levels; second, tort liability already provides a part of the sanction for sub-optimal behavior, thus allowing for a further reduction in monitoring. Moreover, we show that minimum regulation {{does not need to be}} set at a very precise level. On the contrary, any level within a certain range is socially optimal. This allows regulators to further curb their cost by saving on information gathering. We show that an imperfectly working tort system can be fully corrected by minimum regulation in a variety of circumstances (for instance, even if the injurer is unable to compensate for the harm at the optimal level of precaution, and even if the rule in force is strict liability or a cause-in-fact variant of negligence) ...|$|R
