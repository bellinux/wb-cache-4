She had expected that even <b>something</b> <b>nicer</b> than usual {{would be necessary to}} compensate her for past sufferings. At length, worn out by long continued watching and fasting, she went to the closet, provided herself with a cracker, and retired to bed to muse deliberately on the strange character of her aunt.|$|R

2500|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews, with The Hindu's Malathi Rangarajan {{giving the}} film an average review concluding that [...] "the dialogue sparkles in many a place, the direction is neat and song sequences have been inserted intelligently — {{but even with}} such a youthful team what the film lacks is pep and verve." [...] Another critic noted that the film [...] "has predictable, cliched situations, stereotyped characters, and lack-lustre treatment. Half-way through the film, you realise which way the script is being steered." [...] Rediff.com noted that [...] " [...] the film lacks the freshness and grandeur of other films", while Sify called it [...] "a highly melodramatic and over-the-top movie with no logic".

2500|$|... "Mabel," [...] Lunn wrote, [...] "was invincibly English and I {{was much}} consoled during the dark days of 1940 {{by the fact}} that her {{confidence}} in final victory was never shaken." [...] Lunn once said <b>something</b> <b>nice</b> to their daughter Jaqueta about the latter's courage during an air raid. For this he was later reproved by Mabel.

[...] Lunn was an agnostic when they married, and Mabel a devout Anglican, which she remained all her life. Lunn wrote: [...] "Mabel's husband, brother and three children became Catholics, but I never expected her to follow our example. Humanly speaking, she was bound to remain a member of the Church of England." [...] An Anglican vicar once asked Lunn to preach in his church.

[...] But Lunn could never have written [...] "anything unpleasant" [...] about Mabel's Church, and when the first shock of his conversion was over, [...] "Mabel soon yielded not merely notional but real assent to the belief that the doctrinal differences which separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the Catholic were infinitely, yes infinitely, less than those which had separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the agnostic." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Everett Wilson, Sr. — Dennis's cranky, cantankerous, middle-aged next-door neighbor; {{a retired}} postal carrier and (at {{least as far}} as Dennis is concerned) his best adult friend. Dennis likes Mr. Wilson but unintentionally annoys him, as he {{regularly}} disrupts Mr. Wilson's attempts at a serene, quiet life. Dennis often interrupts Mr. Wilson's hobbies such as gardening, as well as coin and stamp collecting, at times accidentally damaging his property. As a result, the gruff old retiree displays a less than cordial attitude towards the young boy, though Dennis continues his well-meaning intrusions unabated. Actually, as many readers suspected, he is secretly fond of Dennis and misses him when he's away — although he'd never openly admit it. Mr. Wilson is named after a teacher Hank Ketcham knew. Dennis will often (especially in the TV series) refer to him as [...] "Good Ol' Mr. Wilson". Although a running gag is that Dennis's pranks drive Mr. Wilson crazy, there are times when Dennis tries to do <b>something</b> <b>nice</b> for Mr. Wilson, such as the time Dennis left Ruff the dog and Hot Dog the cat with Mr Wilson so he wouldn't be lonely on Father's Day, while Dennis and his father went to a baseball game, or the time Dennis tries to cheer Mr. Wilson up on April Fool's day by placing a fake [...] "Mitchell House for sale" [...] sign up. He is named after the first President of the United States, George Washington.|$|E
