Mattoo instead employed Narayan as a sarangi player. Traditionally, the sarangi is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> after the singer and imitate the vocal performance, and play {{in the space between}} phrases.

When the classical pieces spread to the afternoon programme, the management felt it was not commercially viable to continue the concerts. After three years at the tower, Bantock was appointed Principal of the School of Music at Birmingham and Midland Institute.|$|E
