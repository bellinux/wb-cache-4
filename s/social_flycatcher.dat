500|$|The {{leaves of}} Roystonea regia {{are used as}} {{roosting}} sites by Eumops floridanus, the Florida bonneted bat, and {{is used as a}} retreat for Cuban tree frogs (Osteopilus septentriolalis), a non-native species, in Florida. [...] In Panama (where R. regia is introduced), its trunks are used as nesting sites by yellow-crowned parrots (Amazona ochrocephala panamensis). [...] The flowers of R. regia are visited by pollen-collecting bees and are considered a good source of nectar. [...] Its pollen was also found in the stomachs of Phyllonycteris poeyi, the Cuban flower bat (a pollen-feeder) and Monophyllus redmani, Leach's single leaf bat (a nectar-feeder). [...] Artibeus jamaicensis, the Jamaican fruit bat, and Myiozetetes similis, the <b>social</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> feed on the fruit.|$|E

50|$|The <b>social</b> <b>flycatcher</b> and vermilion-crowned flycatcher (Myiozetetes similis) are {{passerine}} birds {{from the}} Americas, {{a member of}} the large tyrant flycatcher family (Tyrannidae).|$|E
50|$|<b>Social</b> <b>flycatchers</b> {{breed in}} plantations, pasture with some trees, and open {{woodland}} from northwestern Mexico south to northeastern Peru, southern Brazil and northwestern Argentina. It {{is a common}} and wide-ranging species and thus not considered threatened by the IUCN.|$|R
50|$|Other common {{birds of}} Victoria Peak and the Cockscomb Basin include: great curassow, crested guan, clay-coloured robins, <b>social</b> <b>flycatchers,</b> collared-seed eaters, crimson-collared tanagers and masked tanagers, bat falcons, Montezuma’s oropendola, {{as well as}} white-collared manakins, paraque, the slaty-breasted tinamou, {{chestnut}} headed oropendolas, parrots, toucans, and Agami heron to name a few.|$|R
50|$|The golden-bellied flycatcher is 20 cm long, weighs 41g {{and has a}} black bill. Its crown is grey with a {{concealed}} yellow patch, {{and it has a}} black eyemask. The upperparts are dark olive, and the wings and tail are brown with faint rufous fringes. The underparts are yellow and the throat is white with dark stripes down each side which distinguish it from similar species like <b>social</b> or gray-capped <b>flycatchers.</b> Young birds have paler yellow underparts, browner upperparts, no crown stripe, and more obvious chestnut fringes to the wing and tail feathers.|$|R
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{split into two}} species with the <b>social</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> Myiozetetes texensis, from Costa Rica northwards to Mexico and the vermilion-crowned flycatcher, M. similis proper, from southwest Costa Rica across South America.|$|E
50|$|The nest, {{built by}} the female in a bush, tree or on a building, is a large roofed {{structure}} of stems and straw, which for protection is often built near a wasp, bee or ant nest, or the nest of another tyrant flycatcher, such as the similar <b>social</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> Myiozetetes similis. The nest site is often near or over water. The typical clutch is two to four brown or lilac-blotched dull white eggs, laid between February and June.In appearance the grey-capped flycatcher resembles the <b>social</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> which shares much of its range. The adult grey-capped flycatcher is 16.5-18 cm long and weighs 26-30 g. The head is grey with a short weak eyestripe and, in the male, a concealed vermilion crown stripe. The upperparts are olive-brown, and the wings and tail are brown with only faint rufous fringes. The underparts are yellow and the throat is white. Young birds have no crown stripe, and have chestnut fringes to the wing and tail feathers. The best distinction from the <b>social</b> <b>flycatcher</b> is the latter’s strong black-and white head pattern.|$|E
50|$|In appearance, the <b>social</b> <b>flycatcher</b> {{resembles a}} smaller boat-billed flycatcher or great kiskadee. The adult is 16 - 18 cm long and weighs 24 - 27 g. The head is dark grey {{with a strong}} white eyestripe and a usually {{concealed}} orange to vermilion crown stripe. The upperparts are olive-brown, and the wings and tail are brown with only faint rufous fringes. The underparts are yellow and the throat is white. Young birds have a paler eye mask, reduced crown stripe, and have chestnut fringes to the wing and tail feathers. The call is a sharp peeurrr and the dawn song is a chips-k’-cheery.|$|E
50|$|The adult Myiozetetes flycatchers are c. 16-18 cm {{long and}} weigh 24-30 g. The upperparts are olive-brown, and {{the wings and}} tail are brown with only faint rufous fringes. The underparts are yellow and the throat is white. Young birds lack the red-orange crown stripe of the adult, and have {{chestnut}} fringes to the wing and tail feathers. The best distinction between the species is the head pattern: Vermilion-crowned, <b>social</b> and rusty-margined <b>flycatchers</b> have strong black-and white head markings like the great kiskadee, whereas grey-capped and dusky-chested flycatchers have greyish heads, with a short weak eyestripe in the former.|$|R
50|$|The adult {{great kiskadee}} {{is one of}} the largest of the tyrant flycatchers. It can measure from 21 to 27 cm in length and weigh 52 to 68 g. The head is black with a strong white eyestripe and a {{concealed}} yellow crown stripe. The upperparts are brown, and the wings and tail are brown with usually strong rufous fringes. The bill is short, thick, and black in color. The similar boat-billed flycatcher (Megarynchus pitangua) has a more massive black bill, an olive-brown back and very little rufous in the tail and wings. A few other tyrant flycatchers — the <b>social</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Myiozetetes similis), for example — share a similar color pattern, but these species are markedly smaller.|$|E
