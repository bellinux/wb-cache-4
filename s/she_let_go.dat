5|$|At 10:38 on {{the morning}} of 21 June, Fury detonated a ground mine off Juno Beach during a gale and the navy decided to tow her into the British Mulberry harbour at Arromanches where her damage could be evaluated. While waiting for a tugboat, she took on a 6° list to {{starboard}} from flooding. The Dutch tug Thames began towing the ship at 13:25; at 21:14, Fury accidentally collided with the stern of a freighter anchored outside the Mulberry, damaging her port side above the waterline, and the towline snapped at 21:49 when she struck another ship several times. <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> her anchor after drifting clear, but it almost immediately started dragging under the pressure of the wind and waves and the salvage ship Lincoln Salvor was secured alongside to steady Fury. Another tug made a towline fast at 22:18, but it immediately snapped when the tug began to pull forward. Lincoln Salvor had to cast off as her wooden hull was being damaged by slamming into Furys hull and six other tugboats attempted to tow the destroyer clear of the shipping in the Mulberry, but they all failed. Fury struck at least three other ships, including petrol and ammunition ships before she was driven ashore at 01:30. Her crew was able to walk to Arromanches at about 05:30 once the tide went out.|$|E
25|$|Ibrahim Abdallah, another sailor on the Sima Com 2, {{recalled}} Bakari's recovery:When {{the girl}} saw us approaching, <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> {{of the piece}} of debris she had been using as a life preserver. Suddenly, a large wave flipped her over and she disappeared from view, until she reappeared a few minutes later. It was at this exact moment that Maturaffi jumped into the water to save her.|$|E
2500|$|Skipjack’s second war patrol, {{conducted}} in the Celebes Sea, was uneventful {{with the exception of}} an unsuccessful attack on a Japanese aircraft carrier. She returned to Fremantle, Western Australia, on 10 March 1942. On 14 April, Skipjack got underway under the command of James W. Coe for her third war patrol, {{conducted in}} the Celebes Sea, Sulu Sea, and South China Sea. On 6 May, contact was made with a Japanese cargo ship, and the submarine moved in for the kill. Finding herself almost dead ahead, Skipjack fired a [...] "down the throat" [...] spread of three torpedoes that sank the Kanan Maru (...) [...] Two days later, the submarine intercepted a three-ship convoy escorted by a destroyer and she fired two torpedoes that severely damaged the merchant ship, Taiyu Maru (...) [...] Then <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> with four more that quickly sank the cargo ship, Bujun Maru (...) [...] On 17 May, Skipjack sank the passenger-cargo ship Tazan Maru (...) off Indochina before heading back to Fremantle.|$|E
6000|$|... "M-yes," [...] {{said the}} Squire, [...] "she's proud. And when a proud girl makes {{a fool of}} herself about a fellow, it's {{a matter of life}} and death with her. She can't help herself. <b>She</b> <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “ ‘We want a {{cavalier}},’ said she, {{holding out}} both her hands, {{as if to}} offer them. ‘And a cavalier you shall have,’ said I, taking hold of both of them. ‘We {{could not have done}} without you,’ said <b>she,</b> <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> one hand, with self-taught politeness, and leading me up with the other.|$|R
6000|$|... "What else is it. You haven't {{been here}} a day, but you must {{telegraph}} for some female {{to be ready to}} hold your hand the moment you go away. And before <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>go,</b> you'll be wiring for another. YOU WANT TO BE LOVED, you want to be loved--a man of your years. It's disgusting--" ...|$|R
60|$|After {{watching}} {{them a little}} longer, <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> Heyst's hand and {{moved away from the}} screen. He followed her into the room.|$|E
60|$|At this <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> {{my wrist}} and {{covered her face}} with her hands passionately. When she dropped them she had the look of one morally crushed.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked up}} at her almost frightened, furtive. Then he nodded, a little sullenly. <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> his hand: he had made not the lightest response. And they sat in silence.|$|E

60|$|Her heart sank, but <b>she</b> <b>let</b> him <b>go</b> on, {{listening}} {{perhaps less}} attentively as she considered {{how to take}} him.|$|R
60|$|Miss Milray {{expected}} {{the child to}} put up her lips to be kissed. But <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> her mother's hand, took her tiny skirts between her finger-tips, and dropped a curtsey.|$|E
6000|$|... "And you'll {{come right}} back with me now?" [...] implored Aunt Olivia, {{clinging}} to him as if she feared he would be whisked away from her yet if <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> for a moment.|$|E
60|$|It was mid-day, {{and high}} {{water in the}} English port for which the Screw was bound, when, borne in gallantly upon the {{fullness}} of the tide, <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> her anchor in the river.|$|E
5000|$|Ma: She is {{the root}} of the family. She is quiet. She does not say much because she does not like trouble. She also wants her kids to keep their old life because she does not like new things. When she finally understands that her kids need to be active and not closed in, <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> of being afraid of the world outside.|$|R

6000|$|... "There's old Granny Fox! Just see how hot {{and tired}} <b>she</b> looks. <b>Let's</b> <b>go</b> down and cool her off!" [...] shouted the Merry Little Breeze.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> my hand. I sunk it {{and my head}} at once, fairly overcrowed, as Spenser {{would have}} termed it, by the mingled {{kindness}} and firmness of her manner. She hastened to change the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{nice and}} old-fashioned," [...] said Fleur calmly. [...] "You're frightfully silent, Jon. Still I like silence when it's swift." [...] <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> his hand. [...] "Did you think I dropped my {{handkerchief}} on purpose?" ...|$|E
60|$|Jude {{had reached}} the window, which was quite a low one, so that she was visible down to her waist. <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the casement-stay {{and put her hand}} upon his, her moonlit face {{regarding}} him wistfully.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>let</b> him <b>go,</b> and Maddalena {{came in at}} the door. [...] "Signorina," [...] she said, [...] "the signora is not well. Shall I {{send for}} the doctor?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>let</b> him <b>go,</b> and Kit {{returned}} to his ship, wondering whether her remarks indicated {{that he ought to}} consult Mrs. Austin before he made friends with Wolf.|$|R

6000|$|Vent. See now {{the effects}} of her so boasted love! She strives to drag you down to ruin with her; But, could she 'scape without you, oh how soon Would <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> her hold, and haste to shore, And never look behind! ...|$|E
60|$|She {{had put her}} {{two hands}} on his shoulder, and her {{forehead}} down on them; the brim of her hat touched his neck, and he felt it quivering. But, {{in a sort of}} paralysis, he made no response. <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> of his shoulder and drew away.|$|E
6000|$|Some blue-bloused {{men looked}} up from their work in the {{vineyards}} a long way off. It {{was no time for}} hesitation. I set my teeth, and I caught hold of the woman's arms. Her bones cracked in my hands before <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>go.</b> Isobel at last was free! ...|$|E
5000|$|The next day, {{the kids}} {{gather at the}} ski jump and try to persuade Gidget not to attempt it, but she does anyway. She starts off well, but during the jump <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> of the handle and crashes into the water. Jeff and Judge jump into a {{speedboat}} and save her. Still desperate to make Jeff jealous, Gidget flirts with Judge who agrees {{to go with her}} to Eddie's performance that night...all in the presence of Jeff.|$|R
60|$|Wingrave took no more {{notice of}} her. She and Aynesworth walked {{together}} to the station. As {{they passed the}} little whitewashed cottage, <b>she</b> suddenly <b>let</b> <b>go</b> his hand, and darted inside.|$|R
60|$|This Turk he had {{one only}} daughter, The fairest my two eyes eer see; She steal the keys of her father's prison, And swore Lord Bateman <b>she</b> would <b>let</b> <b>go</b> free.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> of my hand, {{and sank}} on the floor. The utter despair of that action told me, far more eloquently than the words {{which she had}} just spoken, that her {{resolution}} was immovable. She had deliberately separated herself from me; her own act had parted us forever.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right." [...] <b>She</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> {{and stood}} up. Hendricks lay {{back against the}} ground, his eyes closed. Tasso walked away from him, {{her hands in her}} pockets. She kicked a rock out of her way and stood staring up at the sky. The night {{blackness}} was already beginning to fade into gray. Morning was coming.|$|E
60|$|Joan {{clung to}} Cleve on one side, {{and on the}} other, instinctively with a frightened girl's action, <b>she</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> Kells's arm and slipped her hand in his. He seemed startled. He bent to her ear, for the din made {{ordinary}} talk indistinguishable. That involuntary hand in his evidently had pleased and touched him, even hurt him, for his whisper was husky.|$|E
50|$|On July 28, 2015, Allyson Martinek was <b>let</b> <b>go</b> {{from the}} station, with Blaine Fowler {{remaining}} in mornings. Martinek then later joined WNIC in November 2016, exactly {{one year and}} four months after <b>she</b> was <b>let</b> <b>go</b> from the station.|$|R

The lift can be made more difficult if <b>she</b> <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> of his shoulder, or if he <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> of her hand and she is supported only by her hip.|$|R
