5|$|Arthur, who {{was looking}} to retain the BBBofC Lonsdale Belt, was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rising star in British boxing. He was a strong {{favourite}} to win the bout against Gomez, who was perceived to have been through too many battles and abused his body too much, and the fight was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stepping stone on Arthur's way to a future world championship. However, Freddie Roach, Arthur's trainer, was criticised when he remained in the United States to coach another boxer instead of continuing to work with Arthur to prepare for his championship match.|$|E

5|$|Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs, {{her eyes}} as she checks the {{rear-view}} mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can be <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{is still}} <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sign {{of wealth and}} {{well-being}} {{in many parts of}} Africa. This has become particularly common since the HIV epidemic began.|$|E

5000|$|Scott Soames is {{a notable}} {{opponent}} of two-dimensionalism, which he <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt to revive Russelian-Fregean descriptivism and to overturn what he <b>sees</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "revolution" [...] in semantics begun by Kripke and others. Soames argues that two-dimensionalism {{stems from a}} misreading of passages in Kripke (1980) as well as Kaplan (1989).|$|R

5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E

5|$|A {{meeting of}} the {{parliamentary}} party was held on 15 September at which {{the issue of the}} presidential election was raised. Unexpectedly, one of the party's senators, Labhrás Ó Murchú, sought nominations to run as an independent candidate. This was widely <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> challenge to the authority of Micheál Martin. The extended meeting broke up without agreement. The parliamentary party met again on 20 September. Senator Ó Murchú withdrew his request for a nomination and a motion was passed that the party's Oireachtas members would not nominate or endorse any candidate. The decision was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> severe blow to the attempts to secure a nomination by David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon who were expected to need signatures from individual Fianna Fáil members.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} lives of Edward {{were written in}} the centuries {{following}} his death {{in which he was}} portrayed as a martyr, generally <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> victim of the Queen Dowager Ælfthryth, mother of Æthelred.

5|$|After {{winning the}} December elections, the Fraser {{government}} took {{the approach that}} trade with Southeast Asia and political ties with Southeast Asia were {{too important to be}} put at risk for what was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lost cause. Australia abstained from the 1976 and 1977 UN General Assembly Resolutions, and by 1978 became the only government to officially recognise East Timor as a province of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{conclusive}} evidence might be wanting either way for whether Hebrew Law allowed for impalement, or just hanging, the Neo-Assyrian method of impalement {{as seen in}} the carvings could, perhaps, equally easily be <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of hanging upon a pole, rather than focusing upon the stake's actual penetration of the body.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{has gained}} a {{significant}} online presence, it was successful {{before the advent of}} Internet communities.

5|$|Although not <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strong medal contender, {{one former}} {{champion}} {{participating in the}} race was 49-year-old Jeannie Longo from France, who won the road race in 1996 and had competed in the inaugural event in 1984, making this her seventh appearance.|$|E
