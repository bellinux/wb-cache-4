25|$|The cab {{controls}} {{were similar to}} those on No.42 except that a <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> was provided in addition to the hand brake. The regulator handle was of the normal vertical type but later a long horizontal piece was secured to it, enabling it to be operated from either side.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> acts {{directly}} and immediately; the sudden {{opening of the}} brake valve {{can result in a}} slight overbraking by locking the wheels. The operation of a <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> therefore requires a great deal of experience from the engine driver.|$|E
50|$|On {{the outward}} trip from Stockport to Buxton that day, Driver Axon had noticed a leak from the {{supply to the}} {{locomotive}} <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> and had requested and received fitter's attention at the Buxton depot. On the return trip from Buxton to Stockport, the repair did not hold and the supply pipe {{broke away from the}} <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> disabling the locomotive <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> and whistle. This filled the locomotive cab with scalding steam and prevented Driver John Axon and Fireman Ron Scanlon from reaching the controls.|$|E

50|$|Malcolm was {{interested}} in <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> and took out several patents for improvements {{to this type of}} brake.|$|R
50|$|The class {{featured}} enclosed wheel splashers and cabs from new, but no brakes {{were initially}} fitted; some received <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> and others vacuum brakes.|$|R

50|$|A <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> can be {{operated}} directly by a lever (valve) and also indirectly {{together with the}} vacuum brake. In the latter case, a control valve linked to the vacuum system controls the admission of steam to the brake cylinder, so that the <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> can be activated automatically in an emergency or if the train separates (the so-called 'automatic steam brake').|$|E
50|$|The driver's {{brake valve}} was usually {{combined}} with the <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> control on the locomotive.|$|E
50|$|The locos were {{originally}} fitted with dumb buffers, {{but these were}} changed for small round buffers during the 1930s, some also gaining vacuum brakes during this period; only hand and <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> were fitted when built.|$|R
50|$|The engines were {{fitted with}} Pyle National {{turbo-generators}} and headlamps, with the generator {{attached to the}} top of the smokebox, ahead of the chimney. It had the Hasler speed indicator, sight feed lubricators, Hendrie's steam reversing gear, steam operation for rocking the firegrate, Gresham and Craven injectors, <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> and combination vacuum ejectors.|$|R
5000|$|The G6 BTP {{were built}} with Westinghouse brakes. These were {{replaced}} with <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> on {{all but two}} of the J77s (Nos. 37 and 1437). These were removed in the late 1930s. Twelve of the J77s received vacuum brakes after 1945. This fitting was usually accompanied by the addition of carriage heating equipment.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> {{is a type}} of brake for steam {{locomotives}} {{and their}} tenders, whereby a steam cylinder works directly on the brake linkages.|$|E
50|$|As {{a direct}} result of the accident, the {{prototype}} Saint class locomotive no. 100 - the first of the GWR's many successful 4-6-0 designs - was fitted with vacuum brakes on all wheels of the locomotive and tender, rather than just the locomotive's <b>steam</b> <b>brake.</b> While the <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> on a locomotive was very powerful, it took time to build up pressure on the initial application when the metal surfaces were cold; on a second application it was far more rapid, but this would not occur in an emergency.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>brakes</b> were {{primarily}} used on railways where vacuum brakes {{were used to}} brake the train, but {{where there was no}} vacuum <b>brake</b> on the <b>steam</b> locomotive itself, as for example in the United Kingdom, or where there was only a cable-operated brake (e.g. a Heberlein brake) running along the train, like for example in Saxony on the narrow gauge railways.|$|R
25|$|The {{first two}} {{locomotives}} (St David's and St George) were scrapped {{about the end}} of the nineteenth century, and two new engines were acquired from Andrew Barclay, Sons & Co of Kilmarnock: they were named Fordell, arrived in 1901, and Lord Hobart in 1912. They had <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> (unlike the previous engines which had hand brakes only), and spring buffers for the main line rolling stock.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} shunt {{locations}} with tight curves and weight restrictions, two 0-4-0T locomotives were purchased from Neilson and Company {{to one of}} that company's standard designs by the GER, and {{this was followed by}} an order for a further two locomotives in 1876. In 1894-1895 these four locos were rebuilt under James Holden, the work including new boilers, <b>steam</b> <b>brakes,</b> and covered cabs.|$|R
50|$|The locos have a {{counterweight}} handbrake and a <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> as an auxiliary. Depending on the railway, vacuum or {{compressed air}} brakes were later fitted {{as the train}} brake.|$|E
50|$|Three (8301/08/10) {{were sent}} to Scotland in 1931-32 {{and as a result}} of the move they had their Westinghouse air brake {{replaced}} with a <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> and vacuum ejector.|$|E
50|$|The {{vehicles}} were {{equipped with a}} Hartmann <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> and had inside Allan valve gear. The engines were able to haul a 500 tonne train on an incline of 1:300 at 30 km/h.|$|E

2500|$|The 8750 Class, or 87xx class, {{were first}} built in 1933, using an updated design which {{included}} an improved cab {{with a higher}} roof, rectangular windows and grills (as opposed to the round windows, or [...] "spectacles", of the initial design), and sliding shutters and hinged doors for more protection from the elements. The new style cab {{was derived from the}} sister 5400 class, the first of which were built in 1931. Vacuum <b>brakes,</b> <b>steam</b> heating, and ATC were fitted as standard (except for Nos. 6750–79, built between 1946 and 1950, which were fitted with <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> and three link couplings only). The locomotive weight increased to , and the axle load increased to [...]|$|R
60|$|They {{had struck}} {{a portion of}} the track which was {{comparatively}} free of snow, and the engineer of the train was now trying to make up some of the lost time. The boys were congratulating themselves on this when they suddenly heard a shriek of the locomotive whistle, followed instantly by the sudden application of the <b>steam</b> <b>brakes.</b> The train shuddered and shook, and two seconds later there came a crash from the front, and then the train came to a sudden stop.|$|R
50|$|For braking, the {{locomotives}} {{were originally}} {{equipped with a}} <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> and counterweight brake. In addition the locomotives were fitted for Heberlein brakes. But by 1920 they were given the new Körting vacuum brakes for engine and train.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} driver (US: engineer) worked {{on one side}} of the locomotive, and the fireman on the other; the fireboxes separated them. The regulators for both power bogies were located above the centre of the fireboxes, with the <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> valve at one end.|$|E
50|$|The engine's {{vacuum brake}} {{cylinders}} were fitted outside the main frames under the running boards on each side, between {{the second and}} third pairs of coupled wheels. The vacuum brake operated automatically whenever the train brakes were applied. The use of vacuum braking instead of steam braking became standard practice on locomotives built from 1944 onwards and was welcomed by SAR drivers, who were always reluctant to make use of steam brakes for fear of skidding the coupled wheels. In practice, the trigger on the <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> attachment to isolate the proportional device which admitted steam to the brake cylinder automatically upon the application of the vacuum brake, was invariably wedged down with a wooden peg by drivers to eliminate the <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> entirely.|$|E
50|$|In 1873, {{two years}} after Francis Webb took over as {{engineer}} from Ramsbottom, the new General Manager William Cawkwell decided that black should be the standard colour for all locomotives. The Lady of the Lake class were thus painted as Webb added a cab roof and modified the chimneys of the entire class. When the class received replacement boilers from 1879 to 1883 they were also fitted with <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> (previously only the tender had brakes, and they were wooden ones) and enclosed splashers.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were given}} running-board nameplates and were named after Western Australian mountains, following the tradition established {{five years earlier}} with the Pr class, which were named after Western Australian rivers. The locomotives were fitted with <b>steam</b> <b>brakes,</b> the tenders with vacuum brakes. All were fitted with semi-streamlining cowling over {{the entire length of}} their tops although this was later removed. The tenders were rebuilt reducing their coal capacity from nine to seven tonnes while increasing their water capacity from 15,900 to 22,700 litres.|$|R
50|$|The 3600 {{class were}} fitted with steam {{reversing}} gear, <b>steam</b> <b>brakes,</b> and two steam-operated water pick-ups for forward and reverse working. This reflects their intended work as fast suburban engines. About half were employed on such duties in the Birmingham area. The rest {{worked in the}} London area, though later a few worked Chester-Birkenhead trains, and some were allocated to South Wales sheds. They were essentially passenger train locomotives, and were eventually superseded by Collett's 2-6-2Ts. All were withdrawn and scrapped between 1930 and 1934.|$|R
50|$|The cab {{controls}} {{were similar to}} those on No.42 except that a <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> was provided in addition to the hand brake. The regulator handle was of the normal vertical type but later a long horizontal piece was secured to it, enabling it to be operated from either side.|$|E
50|$|The {{braking effort}} {{achievable}} was limited, {{and an early}} development was {{the application of a}} <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> to locomotives, where boiler pressure could be applied to brake blocks on the locomotive wheels. It was also unreliable, as the application of brakes by guards depended upon them hearing and responding quickly to a whistle for brakes.|$|E
5000|$|To {{begin with}} most of the {{locomotives}} had a <b>steam</b> <b>brake</b> that operated on the second and third coupled axles. The prototype locomotive, No. 736 [...] "KÄNZLI", was initially fitted with a Heberlein brake(!). Several locomotives were later converted to Westinghouse compressed air brakes, the one delivered in 1920, No. 1000, had this on delivery.|$|E
50|$|The pre-war Class 15Fs were {{manually}} stoked and were delivered without smoke deflectors. The original 21 Berliner- and Henschel-built engines remained hand-fired {{for the full}} duration of their working lives. On the pre-war NBL-built engines, on the other hand, provision {{was made in the}} design to later convert them to mechanical stoking. A mechanical stoker was tested on no. 2923 before the remaining locomotives of that group were all equipped with such stokers by the late 1940s. Their brake systems consisted of <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> on the engines and vacuum brakes on the tenders.|$|R
5000|$|During 1944 Dr. M.M. Loubser, then CME, who {{had been}} {{involved}} with the design of the Class 19 family from the very beginning in the late 1920s, made further improvements to the Class 19D. All the post-war locomotives came equipped with vacuum brake systems in addition to the <b>steam</b> <b>brakes.</b> The two 21 in vacuum cylinders were fitted under the running boards on either side at a point about midway between the leading and driving coupled wheels, while the vacuum chamber was arranged in line with the intermediate coupled wheels.|$|R
50|$|The {{valve gear}} {{of the outside}} and inside sets of motion could each be {{separately}} reversed by its own screw gear, while each set also had its own independent regulators, injectors and feed pumps. The locomotive had <b>steam</b> <b>brakes</b> on all coupled wheels as well as both bogies, {{the first and last}} South African steam locomotive to be equipped with braked bogies. The coupled wheels and the rack engine's crank disks had separate hand brakes and the inside and outside piston pairs had separate counter-pressure air brakes. In addition, the locomotive had a combination ejector to work the train's vacuum brakes.|$|R
