5|$|Jellyvision Games did {{not want}} to change much of the older games for the 2011 version. They sought to keep as many of the old game {{question}} types, such as the Jack Attack and Dis Or Dat questions, updating the games to support online play. To counterbalance other types that would not be playable on consoles, such as Gibberish Questions that required players to type in a phrase, the developers added new features to the game, such as the Wrong Answer of the Game. The developers took advantage of other features of the newer consoles: they were able to use rumble features of console controllers to emphasize the effect of <b>Screwing</b> other players, and wrote several humorous titles for the in-game achievements.|$|E
5|$|Ruby Loftus <b>Screwing</b> a Breech Ring (1943) – in {{the autumn}} of 1942 the WAAC {{commissioned}} Knight to paint a portrait to bolster female recruitment to the ordnance factories, as the Ministry of Supply were concerned at the level of disaffection and absenteeism among women working in the factories. The resulting painting {{is one of the largest}} oil paintings in the entire WAAC collection, and the largest single figure portrait it acquired throughout the war. The painting was first shown on 30April 1943 at the Royal Academy and the next day was reproduced in eight British newspapers. The painting, along with Knight and Loftus, also featured in a British Paramount News short film shown in cinemas, and was reproduced in a poster version by WAAC. The success of the painting led to further industrial commissions for Knight throughout the 1940s. In 1945 she painted Switch Works at Ellison Switchgear in Birmingham. This was followed by paintings of operations at the Dow Mac concrete railway-sleeper works and at the Skefko ball bearing factory.|$|E

40|$|Background: Although {{stimulus}} evoked electromyography (EMG) {{is commonly}} used to confirm the accuracy of pedicle <b>screw</b> placement. There are no studies to differentiate between solid <b>screws</b> and hollow <b>screws</b> to the electrical resistance of pedicle <b>screws.</b> We speculate that the electrical resistance of the solid and hollow pedicle <b>screws</b> may be different and then a potential source of error with stimulus-evoked EMG may happen. Materials and Methods: Resistance measurements were obtained from 12 pedicle <b>screw</b> varieties (6 <b>screws</b> of each manufacturer) across the <b>screw</b> shank based on known constant current and measured voltage. The voltage was measured 5 times at each site. Results: Resistance of all solid <b>screws</b> ranged from 0. 084 Omega to 0. 151 Omega (mean = 0. 118 +/- 0. 024 Omega) and hollow <b>screws</b> ranged from 0. 148 Omega to 0. 402 Omega (mean = 0. 285 +/- 0. 081 Omega). There {{was a significant difference}} of resistance between the solid <b>screws</b> and hollow <b>screws</b> (P < 0. 05). The <b>screw</b> with the largest diameter no matter solid <b>screws</b> or hollow <b>screws</b> had lower resistance than <b>screws</b> with other diameters. No matter in solid <b>screws</b> group or hollow <b>screws</b> group, there were significant differences (P < 0. 05) between the 5. 0 mm <b>screws</b> and 6. 0 mm <b>screws,</b> 6. 0 mm <b>screws</b> and 7. 0 mm <b>screws,</b> 5. 0 mm <b>screws</b> and 7. 0 mm <b>screws,</b> 4. 5 mm <b>screws</b> and 5. 5 mm <b>screws,</b> 5. 5 mm <b>screws</b> and 6. 5 mm <b>screws,</b> 4. 5 mm <b>screws</b> and 6. 5 mm <b>screws.</b> The resistance of hollow <b>screws</b> was much larger than the solid <b>screws</b> in the same diameter group (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Hollow pedicle <b>screws</b> have the potential for high electrical resistance compared to the solid pedicle <b>screws</b> and therefore may affect the EMG response during stimulus-evoked EMG testing in pedicle <b>screw</b> fixation especially in minimally invasive percutaneous pedical <b>screw</b> fixation surgery.

25|$|It {{is common}} to have holes in the {{benchtop}} that tools or jigs can be bolted to. In applications where repeated removal and reinstallation of the tool or jig is desirable, <b>screwing</b> into the wood of the benchtop with woodscrews or lag bolts is not an ideal solution, because the wooden threads don't lend themselves to repeated disassembly and reassembly. In such cases, {{it is useful to}} create hardpoints, which are metal threads embedded in the wood. These hardpoints make repeated disassembly and reassembly trouble-free. They are essentially nuts that are embedded into the wood in one way or another. T-nuts (aka tee nuts) are an easy way to create a hardpoint. Custom nuts similar to T-nuts but with holes for woodscrews in place of the spikes are sometimes machined for the purpose.|$|E

Solid <b>screws</b> are stronger and bear the mechanical stresses more than cannulated <b>screws</b> [12]. The mechanical strength of a <b>screw</b> depends on the core diameter.
