40|$|The {{continued}} operation of existing US Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear facilities and laboratories requires a safety reassessment {{based on current}} criteria and guidelines. This also includes evaluations {{for the effects of}} Natural Phenomena Hazards (NPH), for which these facilities may not have been designed. The NPH evaluations follow the requirements of DOE Order 5480. 28, Natural Phenomena Hazards Mitigation (1993) which establishes NPH Performance Categories (PCs) for DOE facilities and associated target probabilistic performance goals. These goals are expressed as the mean annual probability of exceedance of acceptable behavior for structures, systems and components (SSCs) subjected to NPH effects. The assignment of an NPH Performance Category is based on the overall hazard categorization (low, moderate, high) of a facility and on the function of an SSC under evaluation (DOE-STD- 1021, 1992). Detailed guidance for the NPH analysis and evaluation criteria are also provided (DOE-STD- 1020, 1994).

METHODS: Women having limited access to health-care facilities were screened by trained doctors using VIA. If the test was positive, biopsies were taken and when eligible, women were directly treated with cryotherapy. Follow-up was performed with VIA and cytology after 6 months. When cervical cancer was suspected or diagnosed, women were referred. The positivity rate, positive predictive value (PPV) and approximate specificity of the VIA test were calculated. The detection rate for cervical lesions was given.

Of 13 population clusters, seven were randomly allocated to three rounds of screening between 1996 and 2004, while standard care was provided in six (control arm). An activity-based approach {{was employed to}} calculate costs associated with various components of the screening trial. Information on the resources used and on clinical events in each trial arm was derived from trial databases. Total costs for each cluster were estimated in 2004 United States dollars (US$). The incremental cost per life-year saved was calculated for all eligible individuals and for high-risk individuals (i. e. tobacco or alcohol users). Findings The proportion of oral cancers detected {{at an early stage}} (i. e. stage I or II) was higher in the intervention arm than the control arm (42 % versus 24 %, respectively). The incremental cost per life-year saved was US $ 835 for all individuals eligible for screening and US $ 156 for high-risk individuals. Oral cancer <b>screening</b> by visual <b>inspection</b> was performed for under US $ 6 per person.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 A {{comparison}} of two procedures which allocate inspection effort within a production sequence is presented here. The concern for {{quality and the}} need to hold down the costs of quality has resulted in mathematical models which locate inspection so that the desired quality is attained at a minimum cost. In today's manufacturing environment the nature of these production sequences is highly complex. This requires that the models reflect this complexity in a realistic way. Such intricate models can often have restrictions on their applicability because of extensive computational requirements. A model had been developed for nonserial type processes which optimally allocates <b>screening</b> <b>inspection</b> within the sequence. The model includes the effects of imperfect inspection accuracy on the probabilistic flow of material within the process and the cost of repairing defects. This model proved to be an extremely time consuming algorithm which put restrictions on its applicability. In this paper a linear model is developed which approximates the nonlinear objective function of the restrictive model. The purpose; to use the linear form to allow faster solution times for large problems. This model is formulated as zero-one mixed integer programming problem. The approximation model is tested to determine its performance. The testing is to determine the approximation's computational speed relative to the optimal model and its accuracy with respect to minimum cost. The results showed vast improvements in computational speed and the objective function values of the approximation were close to the optimal value...|$|E
40|$|The Metal {{magnetic}} memory (MMM) technique is marketed as a non-destructive testing method to evaluate stress concentration for ferromagnetic materials by measuring {{variations of the}} self-magnetic leakage field (SMLF) distribution on the specimen surface. This method has been implemented as a periodic <b>screening</b> <b>inspection</b> tool by several companies, and {{has been reported to}} be capable of detecting stress concentration in some instances. However, recent literature has suggested that the performance can be unreliable, with many false-calls; however, the reason for the false calls has not been satisfactorily investigated. In this paper, the normal and tangential components of the stress induced SMLF on the surface of specimens made from L 80 steel, which is commonly used for pipes in the petrochemical industry, were measured by two permanently installed magnetic sensor arrays under the earth’s magnetic field. The results show that the SMLF changes are very small (about 10 ~ 30 A/m) in all cases for the material tested and occur mainly in first elastic load cycle. A Finite Element (FE) model has been used to predict the spatial distribution of the magnetic field due to localized MMM. The FE studies show that the defect size and the applied background magnetic field will influence the SMLF signal; however, the signal due to MMM could be swamped by any ferromagnetic material near to the magnetic sensors. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the high probability of false calls with the MMM technique even if there were a significant MMM effect in the material used...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{economic}} aspects of quality control have received wide concern since its developmental stages, however, {{they have not}} been sufficiently explored. Moreover, as the need for complex products of high precision and reliability increases, most industrial firms have experienced some difficulties in meeting that need at reasonable costs with their limited capabilities. Realizing {{that one of the most}} efficient ways of overcoming such difficulties is to properly allocate their inspection efforts within a production process, a mathematical model has been developed for determining the optimal location of <b>screening</b> <b>inspection</b> stations within a nonserial production process. Especially, the effect of imperfect inspection on the probabilistic behaviors of good and defective items is explicitly considered. The model is formulated as a constrained nonlinear zero-one integer program, and it is proved flexible enough to reflect various limitations and requirements existing in general production-inspection systems. As solution techniques, Lawler and Bell's algorithm and Glover's enumeration scheme are proposed with proper fathoming tests obtained by identifying the unique structure of the problem. Glover's scheme is modified to avoid complicated bookkeeping procedures, and FORTRAN programs are developed for both algorithms. The computational efficiencies of the two algorithms are compared with each other by solving randomly generated test problems, and it is shown that Glover's enumeration scheme is more efficient than Lawler and Bell's algorithm under the given conditions for generating test problems. However, it is realized that Glover's scheme is not quite efficient as the problem size increases. Thus, additional research is desired for accelerating enumeration in Glover's scheme. In addition, a nonserial production-inspection system is analyzed by performing some sensitivity analyses showing that the model is adaptive to varying situations...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion Under Insulation (CUI) is a {{widespread}} problem throughout {{the oil and gas}} industry, and is a major cause of pipeline failure. CUI occurs on pipelines fitted with thermal insulation; the insulation itself is protected from the environment by a layer of metallic cladding and sealed to prevent water ingress. This cladding can deteriorate from age or become damaged, allowing the ingress of water into the insulation, which allows corrosion of the external pipe surface to initiate. This corrosion can proceed at an accelerated rate due to the elevated process temperature of the pipe, compromising the integrity of the pipeline. The detection of this type of corrosion is an ongoing problem for the oil and gas industry, as the insulation system conceals the condition of the pipe. Therefore, there is a requirement for a long-range, <b>screening</b> <b>inspection</b> technique which is sensitive to the first ingress of water into the insulation, in order to provide an early warning of areas of a pipeline at risk from CUI. This thesis describes {{the development of a new}} inspection technique which employs guided microwaves as the interrogating signal. Such guided microwaves provide a means of screening the length of a pipeline for wet insulation, by using the structure of a clad and insulated pipeline as a coaxial waveguide to support the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Areas of wet insulation will create impedance discontinuities in the waveguide, causing reflections of the incident microwave signal, allowing the water patches to be detected and located. The performance of such a guided wave inspection system is intrinsically linked to the signal-to-coherent-noise ratio (SCNR) that can be achieved. Therefore, the value of the SCNR that the technique is capable of achieving is of central importance to this thesis. The excitation system is optimised to maximise the SCNR, whilst the effect of typical pipeline features such as bends, pipe supports and the various types of insulation which can be used, are studied to quantify the effect on the SCNR. A wide variety of methods are employed throughout the development of the guided microwave technique described in this thesis. Theoretical methods are employed in the initial stages to enable the development of a model to describe electromagnetic wave propagation in the large coaxial waveguides formed by pipelines. Numerical simulation techniques are employed when there are too many parameters to study for experimentation to be a viable option, and to study complex problems for which no analytical solution exists. Experiments are conducted in the laboratory using a model setup which employs metallic ducting to represent an insulated pipeline. These experiments are performed to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the technique, and to study pipeline features in a controlled environment. Finally, experiments are performed in the field on a section of real industrial pipeline, in order to validate the accuracy of the model experimental setup in representing conditions which exist on real pipelines. The main findings of the thesis are that it is possible to excite a guided microwave signal in a large coaxial waveguide with a high SCNR. Experiments revealed that the technique is highly sensitive to the presence of water in the waveguide. Measurements of the effect of different types of insulation demonstrated that rockwool causes a very low attenuation of the microwave signal, while polyurethane foam insulation has a slightly higher attenuation coefficient. An investigation into the effect of bends determined that, whilst significant mode conversion occurs at a bend, the transmission coefficient of the TEM mode is high for typical bend angles and bend radii in small diameter pipes. The behaviour of the signal at a typical pipe support was also examined; the reflection from the support was minimal, whilst the transmission beyond the support remained relatively high. Whilst there is still further work to be done before this technique can be applied in the field, the major aspects of practical implementation that could affect the technique have been investigated here, and the results consistently indicate the feasibility of the technique for long-range screening of insulated pipelines for water.

In this paper, two multi-characteristic <b>screening</b> (complete <b>inspection)</b> models are proposed with different information processing requirements. In both models, screening specifications are jointly determined by considering all the economic and stochastic factors associated with the characteristics of interest. However, in Model 1, each characteristic has separate screening specifications and the inspection results of conformance (acceptance or rejections) of all the characteristics are used to determine the disposition of an item. In the second model, a joint screening rule based on an aggregation of characteristics is used to allow direct tradeoffs among the quality of characteristics. To implement the second model, the exact measured values of all characteristics of an item have to be recorded and used for a decision on that item.
