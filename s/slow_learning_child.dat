40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with history and slow learning pupils {{in the first three}} years of secondary education. It can be seen as comprising three separate but inter-related elements and begins (Chapter l) with a review of the literature and research findings relating to the teaching of slow learners as well as to the factors concerning historical thinking. This first element then proceeds to discuss the problem of definition of these pupils, since this is subject to wide Interpretation and therefore needs consideration (Chapter 2). The second major aspect (Chapter 3) revolves around the questionnaires distributed to the Heads of History Departments of eighty-three secondary schools. The thirty-three returns from this, dealing with the provision, potential and problems that the <b>slow</b> <b>learning</b> <b>child</b> encounters in learning history, are then subjected to detailed analysis. The third element comprises two components (Chapters 4 and 5). The first is- the experimental/empirical work, i. e. the administration of a series, of tests to less able pupils in a Durham comprehensive school. These tests include items dealing with sequencing, vocabulary, use of evidence, number order and handling historical objects. Finally, the thesis concludes by putting forward a recommended syllabus which adopts a practical skills-based approach for teaching history to slow learning pupils in years one to three at secondary school level. This in turn is subjected to final consideration and critical analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{curriculum}} for the educable mentally retarded {{is based on}} persisting life problems and one of these, as identified by the Cincinnati Public Schools (1964), is learning to communicate ideas. To {{be able to communicate}} effectively your ideas in written form, it is necessary to know how to spell. In order to operate effectively within a school and community, the slow learner will need to complete his development of communicative skills by l earning to write and spell. While it is true that his needs for written expression are considerably less than they are for oral communication, he will, nevertheless, need to acquire some skill in writing and spelling in order to meet daily situations. He will need these skills to write letters, record messages, compile shopping lists, and complete applications and forms. Writing and spelling skills are closely tied to the development of all other communication skills. For the learner, writing and spelling are not ends in themselves, but merely tools for communication and self- expression. The purpose of teaching writing and spelling in the program for the s low learner is to provide him with an easy, effective way h e can communicate. This can be accomplished by developing his ability to write legibly and to spell correctly in meeting ordinary demands of living. (Cincinnati Public Schools, 1964, p. 169) Horn (1968) notes that spelling errors are distracting and take away from the effectiveness of any written work. They can also be embarrassing in personal as well as in business letters, and perhaps crucial in letters applying for work. Because of the advantages of good spelling ability, it is important for a spelling program to be carefully and systematically planned so the student will learn how to spell correctly. Spelling is a part of life. It is a skill which, if properly mastered, will facilitate written expression and make living more pleasant and adequate. Fitzgerald 1951) points out the importance of choosing spelling words for the educable mentally retarded. The words chosen should be carefully evaluated. Some teachers have taught as spelling the words which are used by the children in unit studies. Although it is helpful for the student to be able to recognize these words in regards to meaning and use, he should not always be required to spell them. These words will probably never be written again by many of the children. However, the words in the unit which are needed frequently in writing should {{be a part of the}} spelling curriculum. According to Fitzgerald 1951, p. 13), 2 ̆ 2 A <b>slow</b> <b>learning</b> <b>child</b> should master a small core of basic words rather than dissipate his energy by attempting to learn a large number of words, many of which he will never use. Johnson further supports this theory: Spelling instruction should deal with those words the child uses in his written material, such as answering questions in relation to other academic areas, writing letters, and so forth. These are the words the children use and will be using. These are the words they should know how to spell. Many words contained in any arbitrary list are not designed for any specific child or group of children living in a particular environment and having unique needs. These lists will, consequently, contain many words of little or no value while omitting some of relatively common usage. It is known that a relatively small number of basic words (between two and three hundred) comprise approximately 50 per cent of all written communication. Every child should learn how to spell these words. Beyond this, much of spelling instruction becomes a problem of determining individual need. (Johnson, 1963, p. 218) The writer through past observations of classes for the inter - mediate educable mentally retarded and through past experiences in teaching these classes has noted that there seems to be no consistent rationale for determining the list of spelling words for these children. Some teachers use conventional textbooks, others use important unit study words, while some use survival or environmental words, or a combination of the above, to constitute the spelling program. Since the purpose of this study was to gain information about the spelling programs in the intermediate classes for the educable mentally retarded, the writer sent a questionnaire to the teachers of these classes. The data received was charted in order to show the various approaches to spelling being used by these teachers...|$|E

40|$|From 1959 to 1973, {{individuals}} with measured mental abilities falling {{between one and}} two standard deviations below the mean (70 - 85 IQ) were considered to have borderline mental retardation. When the American Association on Mental Deficiency returned to the traditional two standard deviations below the mean as the upper limit of the mildly mentally retarded range (Grossman, 1973), this group of 2 ̆ 2 borderline 2 ̆ 2 individuals, who {{are referred to as}} 2 ̆ 2 slow learners, 2 ̆ 2 was, in effect, 2 ̆ 2 decertified. 2 ̆ 2 Although several investigators have acknowledged the continuing educational difficulties of these individuals, the slow learner has been neglected in the literature of the past two decades. This study examined educational practices in a middle-class suburban community in central Connecticut with respect to slow learners. It presented descriptive data regarding the attempt of one school district to meet their needs. It investigated distribution, characteristics and diagnostic criteria, success of educational outcomes, perceived effectiveness of and satisfaction with current practices, and perceived obstacles to optimal program implementation. Qualitative methodology, including in-depth interviews and document review, was employed. A sample of <b>slow</b> <b>learning</b> <b>children</b> was included as the subjects of this study, utilizing a descriptive case study approach. School psychologists and educational diagnosticians, as primary 2 ̆ 2 gatekeepers 2 ̆ 2 to special education programs, and administrators of special education programs, were interviewed. Interviews were also conducted with school administrators, pupil personnel staff, regular classroom teachers, and special educators. Surveys were completed by regular classroom teachers and special educators. The study corroborated the belief in the literature that the special education referral-diagnostic process is a highly subjective endeavor lacking in reliability. Although the study confirmed the practice of qualifying slow learners for special education, it suggested that the needs of slow learners are currently not being met in public schools. Calling for further research regarding how best {{to meet the needs of}} slow learners, the study concluded that the current special education categorical system is in need of reform. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to use and evaluate a preventative measure against reading failure at the kindergarten level. This technique of prevention used diagnostic detection. of potential reading difficulties followed by individualized treatment of indicated problem areas. A careful attempt was made to answer the following questions. 1. What is the most effective time to begin remedial reading instruction? 2. Do undetected difficulties in pre-reading skills lead to reading failure? 3. Is the original kindergarten screening test used as efficient as, or more efficient than, the standardized tests in current use? 4. Which techniques and methods of instruction are most effective for teaching pre-reading skills? 5. Can teacher aides, given training, be used effectively for individualized instruction? The kindergarten population of a large urban public school district with a high percentage of bi-lingual (Portuguese) residents and a history of reading problems was selected for this study. From a group of 1, 200 kindergartners a sample of 264 was selected. Each child received a battery of reading, achievement and diagnostic tests. An original Kindergarten Screening Test [...] to be referred to as the KS test [...] was used as one of the diagnostic instruments. Those children who failed five or more test items were included in this study. A Campbell and Stanley two group post-test design was used as a model. A total of twenty schools were involved in the study. The results of this investigation proved that: 1. The kindergarten level is a favorable and appropriate time to begin instruction based upon diagnosed weaknesses in pre-reading skills. 2. The value of early identification and treatment of diagnosed weaknesses of pre-reading skills can be measured by its effectiveness in later reading achievement. 3. The KS Test proved to be as efficient as the standardized tests used, with clearer diagnostic implications in some areas. 4. Bi-lingual and <b>slow</b> <b>learning</b> <b>children</b> showed gains in reading skills following early diagnosis and individualized instruction. 5. Training and use of teacher aides as tutors proved to be an effective and useful adjunct for the classroom teacher at kindergarten level. In general, this program of early identification and individualized instruction was successful in bringing up to grade level those children identified as having potential learning difficulties...|$|R

But grades and tests in mathematics from 2009 in Sweden shows {{there is a}} crack between the subject being taught and the <b>learning</b> <b>child.</b> The purpose with this research is to find an understanding from a teaching and learning perspective of which teaching method is more suitable for teaching and learning mathematics by doing a comparison between two methods. The main question is: What are {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the traditional and the laboratory method of teaching, supported by the two keywords teaching method and learning? This C-paper is based on a qualitative research aiming to gather an in-depth understanding of human behavior. Semi-structured interviews was used on two teachers in primary school, both teachers have integrated classes, grade 2 and 3. Observations were made in both classes. The empirical data was analyzed through theories and sorted in advantages and disadvantages. The result of the traditional method distinguishes to have a textbook and has a reproductive way of teaching, while concrete mathematics has a more reflecting approach. The school using concrete method is also using the model of the four learning style (visual, verbal, tactile and kinesthetic).

40|$|This {{study used}} {{anatomical}} cues {{to suggest a}} functional dissociation between {{the roles of the}} entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus in learning. The authors proposed that the highly convergent inputs to the entorhinal cortex indicate this region may be particularly important for selecting or compressing information. This hypothesis was tested in rabbits (Oryctolagus cunniculus) trained on an associative learning task that is a common index of stimulus selection. In this task, known as latent inhibition, preexposure to a stimulus (such as a tone) leads to <b>slowed</b> <b>learning</b> when the same tone is subsequently paired with an outcome (such as an airpuff to the eye). As hypothesized, rabbits with neurotoxic lesions of the entorhinal cortex failed to show <b>slowed</b> <b>learning</b> following preexposure (no latent inhibition) and learned the association faster than control rabbits.

Pianists also demonstrated faster RTs and superior sequence acquisition in comparison with nonpiartists.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the problem of}} teaching the early reading to <b>slow</b> <b>learning</b> students. In {{the early stages of}} reading development we often encounter problems because of the non-reclaimed prerequisites for reading, such as understanding of the reading concept, narrative ability, vocabulary, recognition of letters, visual differentiation, phonological awareness and interest for learning to read. On the acquisition of reading also affect cognitive factors, perceptual factors, socio-cultural factors, emotional factors, motivation, memory factors and factors of rapid automatic naming. Early reading by <b>slow</b> <b>learning</b> students, is under influence of specific factors, typical for this group of <b>children.</b> <b>Slow</b> <b>learning</b> students are slowly processing informations. They are also having problems with working memory, spatial memory and verbal memory. Consequently they need more time to achieve knowledge and more repetition. They also need additional explanations and visualizations. Teachers have to connect their knowledge with their life experiences and concrete examples, which facilitates memorization. Multisensory and systematic approach with precise and simple instructions, explanations and feedback information is very important. Work with <b>slow</b> <b>learning</b> students is expected to be diverse and interesting from the aspect of teaching utility and activity. This increase learning motivation and preserve consentration of a student. There are many strategies we can use. Our choice of strategies depends on needs of a specific student. The thesis {{presents the}} development of reading, necesary prereading skills for it, reading efficiency factors, issues that can interact in early reading faze, characteristics of slow learners and strategies for work with them, connected with early reading faze. The empirical part presents a training programm of help for a student in the second grade. His teacher has recognized a major learning issues when they were learning to read. Before he was putted in the training program, he was included in first level of Original working project of help, because of his <b>slow</b> <b>learning,</b> especially with early reading, writing, doing math and having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The teacher gave him a differentiation and individualization of the class, but this approach did not gave any results. The functional abilities of the student were tested before and after the trainig program through different tests. Those tests were: a Test of reading and writing disorders, the Acadia test, the Evaluation Scheme reading achievement, the Rapid automated naming test, the Test of phonological awareness and Assessment of students' reading. Through the training program the student improved his phonological awareness (auditory discrimination, segmentation, synthesis, analysis, rhymes), recognition of letters and the associative connection betwen letters and phonemes.
