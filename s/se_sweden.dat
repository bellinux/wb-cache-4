40|$|Here {{we report}} new reconstructions of winter {{temperature}} and summer moisture {{during the past}} millennium in southeastern Sweden, based on stable-isotope data from a composite tree-ring sequence, that further enhances our {{knowledge and understanding of}} seasonal climate variability in the Northern Hemisphere over the past millennium. Key features of these new climate proxy records include evidence for distinctive fluctuations in winter temperature in <b>SE</b> <b>Sweden,</b> superimposed upon the general pattern of cooling between the so-called Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) of the early millennium and the Little Ice Age (LIA) of the late millennium, as well as evidence for sustained summer wetness during the MCA, followed by drier and less variable conditions during the LIA. We also explore these new records within a circumpolar spatial context by employing self-organizing map analysis of meteorological reanalysis data to identify potential modern analogues of mid-tropospheric synoptic circulation types in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics that can reconcile varying seasonal climate states during the MCA and LIA in <b>SE</b> <b>Sweden</b> with less variable conditions in southwestern Canada, as portrayed by paleoclimate records developed in the same manner in an earlier study...|$|E

40|$|The Bronze Age of Scandinavia (1750 - 500 BC) is {{characterized}} by the sudden appearance of bronze objects in Scandinavia, the sudden mass appearance of amber in Mycenaean graves, and the beginning of bedrock carvings of huge ships. We take this to indicate that people from the east Mediterranean arrived to Sweden on big ships over the Atlantic, carrying bronze objects from the south, which they traded for amber occurring in <b>SE</b> <b>Sweden</b> in the Ravlunda-Vitemölla–Kivik area. Those visitors left strong cultural imprints as recorded by pictures and objects found in <b>SE</b> <b>Sweden.</b> This seems to indicate that the visits had grown to the establishment of a trading centre.

40|$|In this thesis, I combine {{molecular}} analyses, common-garden {{and field}} experiments {{to examine how}} evolutionary and ecological processes influence patterns of genetic variation among and within populations of the declining, insect-pollinated, self-incompatible, perennial herb Primula farinosa. More specifically I examined 1) whether genetic diversity at neutral marker loci was related to habitat fragmentation and habitat stability, 2) whether floral display and flowering time were more strongly differentiated among populations than were putatively neutral marker loci, 3) whether adaptive population differentiation could be detected on a local spatial scale, and 4) whether floral display differentially affected male and female reproductive success. Genetic diversity at neutral marker loci was lower within fragmented populations on the Swedish mainland than within the more densely occurring populations on the island Öland, <b>SE</b> <b>Sweden.</b> On Öland, fluctuations in population size were more pronounced on thin than on deep soils, but genetic diversity {{was not related to}} soil depth. Among-population genetic differentiation in scape length and flowering time was stronger than that of neutral marker loci, which is consistent with divergent selection acting on these traits. Water availability should influence the length of the growing season and thus the time available for fruit maturation, but flowering time in a common-garden experiment was not related to estimates of water availability at sites of origin. In a reciprocal transplant experiment conducted among four populations separated by up to a few kilometres and growing in environment differing in water availability and grazing intensity, no evidence of local adaption was observed. Finally, in a field experiment, interactions with pollinators and antagonists differentially affected selection on floral display through male and female function. Taken together, the results indicate that habitat connectivity and environmental heterogeneity contribute to high neutral and adaptive genetic variation in Primula farinosa on the island Öland, <b>SE</b> <b>Sweden,</b> and illustrate that effects on both male and female reproductive success need to be considered to understand fully the evolution of floral display...|$|E

We assume that the fracture intensity is calculated from the fractures that fully transect the core.

Solutions have been calculated in the specific case of fractal fracture networks with power law length distribution. We show that the Terzaghi correction may significantly overestimate the frequency of fractures subparallel to the borehole. The correction procedure proposed here was tested on a fracture database recorded at a study site for a repository of spent nuclear fuel located in <b>SE</b> <b>Sweden,</b> with three outcrop maps and three boreholes.

Breeding near conspecifics or other wader species, especially lapwings (Vanellus vanellus) and further away from potential predator perches {{were the most important}} factors in decreasing nest predation. A comparison between different shore meadows along the east coast of the island revealed that large, open areas suffered less from nest predation. Thus, shore meadows suitable for breeding godwits should be large and without trees or other predator perches and have a grazing regime that favours variation in vegetation height. Over 80 % of previously ringed adults returned each year, but very few birds ringed as chicks were recovered. Hatching success was 55 - 60 % for all observed nests. To predict the future of the current population, demographic data were used in an ecological risk analysis. The simulations showed that the Gotlandic population will not survive the coming 40 years without immigration. Black-tailed godwits are divided into three subspecies. Genetic analyses (mtDNA) revealed that all subspecies had unique haplotypes and there was a clear geographic structure among subspecies. Within the limosa subspecies, godwits on Gotland and Öland showed a high proportion of rare haplotypes, but no genetic variation was found in Dutch birds. These results imply that black-tailed godwits on Gotland and Öland have high conservation value...|$|R

While numerous {{studies have focused on}} mixing and stratification in large lakes, the ecology and hydrodynamics of small lakes remain grossly understudied. This is critical because small lakes are far more abundant than large lakes globally. We studied a small (< 1000 m 2) and shallow (< 0. 6 m) lake with clear water and dense submerged charophyte stands located on Öland, <b>SE</b> <b>Sweden,</b> between March 25 th and May 29 th to investigate the thermal regimes, surface heat fluxes and stratification and mixing processes. Daytime vertical temperature differences developed in the water column ranging from 3 °C in March to 15 °C in May. Cooling of surface waters led to full convective mixing of the water column each night. The lake shallowed from March to May. The largest temperature differences were recorded in the early afternoon although wind speeds were highest at this time. The dense charophyte cover rapidly attenuated depth penetration of wind-induced mixing and radiative fluxes. Dense macrophyte stands can engineer their own environment by facilitating build-up of steep temperature and chemical gradients.

Two periods with different breeding success could be detected. In 1997 – 1999, nest success varied between 43 and 64 %. Chick survival was not studied in these years. In 2000 – 03, nest success was lower and varied between 6 and 20 %. Survival of chicks from hatching to fledging was estimated at 18 %. Hence, overall productivity in 2000 – 03 was low and estimated to be only 0. 13 fledglings per breeding pair. Nest survival rates were negatively related to incubation initiation date but fledging success {{was not related to}} hatching date. Adult survival rate was analysed from capture-resighting data of 164 adult Redshanks and was estimated at 80 %. Adult survival did not differ significantly between sexes or between years. The results from this study suggest that reproductive success was lower than needed for a self-sustainable population, at least in the latter period with particularly low nest survival rates. There was no apparent change in management of meadows during the study period. Therefore, the decrease in nest survival rates was more likely to be an effect of changes in predator densities and/or behaviours. Further studies are needed to disentangle the mechanisms behind demographic processes in wader populations on coastal meadows...|$|E
40|$|Several wader species {{breeding}} {{in agricultural}} landscapes are declining in Europe. Here, we present evidence that reproduction in a subpopulation of an abundant but vulnerable wader species, the Redshank Tringa totanus, {{is too low}} for self-sustainability. We used population data collected from Gotland, <b>SE</b> <b>Sweden,</b> during the breeding seasons of 1997 [long dash] 2003. We used analytic and simulation-based sensitivity analyses of a stage-based matrix model of female Redshanks to compare {{the relative importance of}} specific vital rates to [lambda] (population growth rate). For each vital rate, we present estimates of mean values and parameter limits. At mean values of vital rates, [lambda] is estimated to 0. 876, while the computer simulation yields an average [lambda] of 0. 860 (95 % confidence intervals: 0. 770 [long dash] 0. 950), which is significant lower than 1. Further, analytic sensitivity of [lambda] is highest to adult survival followed by chick survival and nest success. Analytic elasticity of [lambda] ranks vital rates in a similar way as analytic sensitivity, and the computer simulation also indicates that the rankings of sensitivities and elasticities are robust to parameter uncertainties. In the simulated data, almost half of the variation in [lambda] was explained by variation in adult survival (41 %). The explanatory power of chick survival (27 %) and nest success of first clutches (22 %) was intermediate while other vital rates accounted for negligible amounts of variation. We conclude, however, that the potential to increase an already high adult survival is limited. Therefore, management actions should aim to increase reproductive success mediated via decreased nest predation rates and increased survival of Redshank chicks simultaneously...|$|E

One of the more significant finding to emerge from this study is that, the foundations-access to finance is one of the critical challenges on which the fate of each SE depends. Most of the times, societies do not acknowledge the role of social enterprises and the values they bring to the society. From this, SEs cannot attract support of any kind. SEs lack the understanding and significance of marketing. Making people understanding SEs’s role, would provide them with a positive public image and thereafter support. Suggestions for future research: The study has a small sample size and results cannot be generalizable. A natural progression of this work is to analyse: Challenges on SEs with focus on Society, The impact of Society on SEs, Public identity of SEs and importance of Society. Contribution of the thesis: Dependency on fundraising, grants and donations are heavily connected with widespread lack of understanding the impact of SEs on society. SEs managers should apply different marketing tactics to communicate their role in welfare of the community...|$|R
40|$|A cultivation-based {{approach}} {{was used to}} determine the in vitro antagonistic potential of soil bacteria towards Rhizoctonia solani AG 3 and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini (Foln 3). Four composite soil samples were collected from four agricultural sites with previous documentation of disease suppression, located in France (FR), the Netherlands (NL), <b>Sweden</b> (<b>SE)</b> and the United Kingdom (UK). Similarly, two sites from Germany (Berlin, G-BR; and Braunschweig, G-BS) without documentation of disease suppression were sampled. Total bacterial counts were determined by plating serial dilutions from the composite soil samples onto R 2 A, AGS and King's B media. A total of 1, 788 isolates (approximately 100 isolates per medium and site) was screened for antifungal activity, and in vitro antagonists (327 isolates) were found amongst the dominant culturable bacteria isolated from all six soils. The overall proportion of antagonists and the number of isolates with inhibitory activity against F. oxysporum were highest in three of the suppressive soils (FR, NL and SE). Characterization of antagonistic bacteria revealed a high phenotypic and genotypic diversity. Siderophore and protease activity were the most prominent phenotypic traits amongst the antagonists. The composition and diversity of antagonists in each soil was site-specific. Nevertheless, none of the antimicrobial traits of bacteria potentially contributing to soil suppressiveness analyzed in this study could be regarded as specific to a given site.

5000|$|David Morrell {{says that}} in {{choosing}} the name Rambo he was inspired by [...] "the sound of force" [...] {{in the name of}} Rambo apples, which he encountered in Pennsylvania. These apples, in turn, were named for Peter Gunnarsson Rambo who sailed from Sweden to New <b>Sweden</b> (<b>SE</b> Pennsylvania/Southern NJ/Northern Delaware) in the 1640s, and soon the name would flourish in New Sweden. The name Rambo was likely derived from a shortened form of [...] "Ramberget" [...] (a hill on the Hisingen island near Gothenburg, where Peter Gunnarsson was born) plus [...] "bo" [...] (meaning [...] "resident of"). Today, many of his descendants can still be found in this region of the US. Morrell felt that its pronunciation was similar to the surname of Arthur Rimbaud, the title of whose most famous work A Season in Hell, seemed to him [...] "an apt metaphor for the prisoner-of-war experiences that I imagined Rambo suffering". Furthermore, an Arthur J. Rambo was an actual U.S. soldier in Vietnam, but he never returned. His name can be seen on the Vietnam War Memorial wall in Washington, DC. By sheer coincidence, the Japanese word [...] "rambō" [...] (乱暴) means [...] "violent" [...] or [...] "rough". He was granted the first name [...] "John" [...] as a reference to the song [...] "When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again".|$|R
