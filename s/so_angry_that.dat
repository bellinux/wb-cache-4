During a time of flood and famine, she turned part of the family's country estate into a hospital and distributed food and clothing to the poor. According to one account, her father-in-law was <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> <b>that</b> he took away from her {{the keys to the}} supply rooms; but gave them back when he saw that the corn bin and wine barrel were replenished after Frances finished praying.|$|E
25|$|The Acts of the Apostles {{describes}} the disciple Stephen being seized and {{brought before the}} Sanhedrin. Those who opposed Stephen persuaded false witnesses to testify that Stephen was guilty of blasphemy against Moses and against God. Stephen used the occasion of his trial to remind the Sanhedrin of the Old Testament testimony of rebellion, idolatry, and persecution of the prophets that culminated {{in the murder of}} Jesus. The crowd was <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> <b>that</b> Stephen was stoned to death.|$|E
25|$|Mangeshkar {{took her}} first lesson from her father. At {{the age of}} five, she started to work as an actress in her father's musical plays (Sangeet Natak in Marathi). On the first day in school, she started {{teaching}} songs to other children. When the teacher stopped her, she was <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> <b>that</b> she stopped going to the school. Other sources cite that she left school because they would not allow her to bring Asha with her, as she would often bring her younger sister with her.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in 1983, he {{had begun}} the writing and drawing of a comic strip, The Angriest Dog in the World, which {{featured}} unchanging graphics of a tethered dog that was <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> <b>that</b> it could not move, alongside cryptic philosophical references. It ran from 1983 until 1992 in the Village Voice, Creative Loafing and other tabloid and alternative publications. It was around this period that Lynch also became interested in photography as an art form, and travelled to northern England to take photos of the degrading industrial landscape, something that he was particularly interested in.|$|E
25|$|In 1817, Beauclerk {{played in}} a highly {{controversial}} match at Nottingham in which he captained an All-England team while Osbaldeston and Lambert were given men for Nottingham. Accusations of match-fixing were made by both sides and Beauclerk was able to produce witnesses who implicated Lambert. As a result, MCC banned Lambert from ever playing again at Lord's Cricket Ground. Osbaldeston's turn came in 1818 after he too lost his temper when beaten at single wicket by George Brown of Sussex. Osbaldeston was <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> <b>that</b> he resigned his MCC membership. Later, he repented and asked to be reinstated but Beauclerk refused his application.|$|E
25|$|But Virgil {{is still}} furious, and {{continues}} to berate the Emperor about class snobbery which he sees as the reason Holenia tried to drown the pups. He is <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> <b>that</b> he forgets Johanna is standing there listening and tells the Emperor he never should have agreed to give up Johanna to save her from a commoner's life with him. Johanna realises what Virgil has done and forgives him, and tells the Emperor that better she take one chance in a million of a happy life with Virgil, than no chance at all with someone she cannot love. The Emperor agrees to let Virgil and Johanna wed.|$|E

25|$|Abu Nidal's first {{independent}} operation {{took place on}} September 5, 1973, when five gunmen using the name Al-Iqab ("The Punishment") seized the Saudi embassy in Paris, taking 11 hostages and threatening {{to blow up the}} building if Abu Dawud was not released from jail in Jordan, where he had been arrested in February 1973 for an attempt on King Hussein's life. Following the incident, Mahmud Abbas of the PLO took flight to Iraq to meet Abu Nidal. In the meeting Abbas became <b>so</b> <b>angry,</b> <b>that</b> he stormed out of the meeting, followed by the other PLO delegates, and from that point on, the PLO regarded Abu Nidal as a mercenary.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Christabel {{gives birth}} to a baby boy. Her father is <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> <b>that</b> he swears to have her killed, so he puts her into a small boat with her new-born baby and they are set adrift without food or water, {{at the mercy of}} the winds and the currents, to share a fate that is {{suffered}} also by Emaré and by Geoffrey Chaucer’s heroine Constance in his Canterbury tale from the Man of Law. Soon they are driven onto a rock, and mother and baby go ashore to sit with the seagulls. A griffin appears from out of nowhere and carries the baby off.|$|E
25|$|In 1712, {{during the}} Kangxi Emperor's last {{inspection}} {{tour of the}} south, Yinreng, who {{was put in charge}} of state affairs during his father's absence, tried to vie for power again with his supporters. He allowed an attempt at forcing the Kangxi Emperor to abdicate when his father returned to Beijing. However, the emperor received news of the planned coup d'etat, and was <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> <b>that</b> he deposed Yinreng and placed him under house arrest again. After the incident, the emperor announced that he would not appoint any of his sons as crown prince for the remainder of his reign. He stated that he would place his Imperial Valedictory Will inside a box in the Palace of Heavenly Purity, which would only be opened after his death.|$|E

25|$|He {{found it}} {{difficult}} to control the mainly Burman region of Toungoo (Taungoo), over which Ava had only nominal suzerainty. When Thinkhaya, the ruler of Toungoo, came to Ava in 1426, he was treated almost as equal by Mohnyin Thado. Mohnyin Thado tried to encircle Toungoo by making his brother the governor of Tharrawaddy, an adjacent region of Toungoo, and staying on good terms with King Binnya Ran I of Hanthawaddy. Nonetheless, Thinkhaya formed an alliance with Binnya Ran, decided to raise a rebellion and laid siege to Prome. However Binnya Ran simply wanted to keep Ava occupied, and was not eager to restart a war with Ava. He sent envoys to Ava, asking for a princess of Ava as the price of alliance. Mohnyin Thado was <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> <b>that</b> he kept the envoys for three months without audience, and had to be dissuaded from killing them. He finally decided to ally with Hanthawaddy and gave his niece to the Hanthawaddy king. Toungoo remained out of his reach {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E
25|$|In 270, {{the emperor}} Sun Hao was deeply grieved when his {{favourite}} concubine, Lady Wang, died of illness, so he remained indoors {{for many months}} and refused to meet his subjects. At the time, there were rumours that Sun Hao was dead and that either Sun Fen or Sun Feng (孫奉; a grandson of Sun Ce) would become the new emperor. Zhang Jun (張俊), the Administrator of Yuzhang Commandery, believed the rumours and hoped that Sun Fen would become the new emperor, so he sent his men {{to clean up the}} tomb of Lady Zhong (Sun Fen's mother) in Yuzhang Commandery in an attempt to please Sun Fen. When Sun Hao found out, he was <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> <b>that</b> he had Zhang Jun arrested and executed by dismemberment. Zhang Jun's family members were also put to death. Sun Fen and his family were implicated, arrested and condemned to death. When he pleaded with Sun Hao to spare him and his five sons and allow them to live {{the rest of their lives}} as beggars, Sun Hao refused and forced them to commit suicide by consuming poison.|$|E
25|$|Lin also seriously {{attempted}} {{to withdraw from}} the nomination, but was not able to do so because Mao had made Lin's appointment a decision of the Central Committee, so rejecting the position would violate Party procedure and would risk ending Lin's political career. Lin was not present at the conference where it was decided to name him vice chairman. After Lin was named, he met with Mao and begged him personally not to name him to the position, but Mao criticized him, comparing Lin to the Ming emperor Shizong, who devoted so much of his time to the search for longevity medicines that he neglected his government responsibilities. In 1966 all other candidates for the position were removed, and Lin accepted the position as sole Vice-Chairman, replacing Liu Shaoqi as Mao's unofficial successor. After his appointment, Lin again {{attempted to}} submit a formal written request to Mao, asking Mao to rescind Lin's appointment to the position of vice-chairman, but Mao again rejected this request. When Lin received the rejection letter, he was <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> <b>that</b> he tore the letter up and threw it in the garbage.|$|E

Jewel described Armstrong as [...] "cursing & swearing like a pirate" [...] throughout the battle; <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> <b>that</b> even Black Hawk's warriors purported to hear her.

500|$|Before {{the family}} can call it a day, they arrive home and find Amber and Ginger waiting in their driveway. Amber shows Marge and the kids video footage of a drunk Homer marrying Amber in Vegas, while Ginger is next door with the widowed Ned Flanders. Homer tries to get his {{marriage}} to Amber annulled by the court, but Judge Constance Harm refuses, stating that Homer married Amber in Nevada and the marriage still stands, since Homer never officially divorced Amber. Marge is <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> <b>that</b> she banishes Homer, who takes up residence in Bart's treehouse with Amber. Homer still loves Marge and refuses to sleep with Amber, so he tries to sleep in Santa's Little Helper's kennel, but ends up getting its doorway stuck to his head and spends {{the rest of the}} night trying to get it off. The next day, Marge finds Homer asleep amid the broken remains of the doghouse, and she tells Homer that she is still angry at Homer over what he did, but she has a plan to get Amber out of their house.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were so positive, however. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a more mixed two stars out of five. The two cited dense {{dialogue}} and bizarre characterization—most notably the fact that [...] "there's usually one FBI agent <b>so</b> <b>angry</b> <b>that</b> he interrupts [...] only to be stopped by a calmer counterpart"—as detractors. Shearman and Pearson, however, did praise the final ten minutes, noting that the final act was [...] "so good [...] that it almost makes up for the episode which sadly returns to {{the style of the}} traditional mytharc exposition". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it no stars out of four. She heavily derided the plot, noting that the episode turned Scully into a [...] "passive, mostly silent Virgin Mary who is about to give birth to… Jesus Christ." [...] She concluded that the episode [...] "raise the [...] to a whole new level".|$|E
60|$|And {{with that}} last dreadful blow, Rose {{walked out of}} the room, leaving Charlie as much {{astonished}} as if one of his pet pigeons had flown in his face and pecked at him.

60|$|It was tacitly {{understood}} in the port that John Nieven was a fierce misogynist; and the absurd character of the sally convinced me that he meant to be nasty--very nasty--had meant to say the most crushing thing he could think of.
