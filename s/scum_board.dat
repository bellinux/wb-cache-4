Analysis of the effect of turbulence model and computational grid on simulation results has been carried out in order to maximize the efficiency of numerical simulations. The goal of the thesis is to examine the effect of <b>scum</b> <b>board</b> position on separation efficiency of a single side weir CSO chamber...|$|E
