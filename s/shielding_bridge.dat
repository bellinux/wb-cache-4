40|$|The {{highway system}} in the State of Iowa {{includes}} many grade separation structures constructed to provide maximum safety and mobility to road users on intersecting roadways. However, these structures can present possible safety concerns for traffic passing underneath due to close proximity of piers and abutments. Shielding of these potential hazards has been a design consideration for many years. This study examines historical crash experience in the State of Iowa to address the advisability of <b>shielding</b> <b>bridge</b> piers and abutments {{as well as other}} structure support elements considering the offset from the traveled way. A survey of nine Midwestern states showed that six states had bridge pier shielding practices consistent with those in Iowa. Data used for the analyses include crash data (2001 to 2007) from the Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT), the Iowa DOT’s Geographic Information Management System (GIMS) structure and roadway data (2006) obtained from the Office of Transportation Data, and shielding and offset data for the bridges of interest. Additionally, original crash reports and the Iowa DOT video log were also utilized as needed. Grade-separated structures over high-speed, multilane divided Interstate and primary highways were selected for analysis, including 566 bridges over roadways with a speed limit of at least 45 mph. Bridges that met the criteria for inclusion in the study were identified for further analysis using crash data. The study also included economic analysis for possible shielding improvement...|$|E

50|$|SR 178 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 13 Business {{in the town}} of Exmore. The business route heads south as Main Street northeast as Lincoln Avenue. SR 178 follows Main Street to US 13 (Lankford Highway), at which point the highway becomes Belle Haven Road. North of the boundary between the towns of Exmore and Belle Haven, the state highway crosses the Northampton - Accomack county line. In the center of Belle Haven, the state highway meets the western end of SR 181 (King Street); SR 178 turns west onto <b>Shields</b> <b>Bridge</b> Road, which crosses Occohannock Creek on the namesake bridge.

Within that village, the state highway passes St. George's Church has a very short concurrency with SR 180, which heads northwest as Harborton Road and southeast as Pungoteague Road.

40|$|Latex Modified Concrete (LMC) is ordinarily {{used as a}} thin overlay to <b>shield</b> <b>bridge</b> decks {{from the}} {{intensified}} application of deicers and environmental elements {{as well as the}} normal wear and tear due to traffic. LMC is an ideal concrete for bridge overlays due to its low permeability, inherent flexibility, and excellent adhesion. Another important quality for this concrete that can’t be neglected is its lifespan. Currently, the standard is to use 24. 5 gallons of latex for every cubic yard of concrete needed (121 L/m 3). Recognizing that the latex is an expensive ingredient and its cost may dramatically increase when the oil prices are sky rocketing, the immediate objective of this research is to study the impact of reducing the quantity of latex used in a cubic yard of concrete. The goal is to reduce the initial cost of making the LMC by decreasing the amount of latex without affecting its performance and durability. The test results showed that LMC mix design with latex content of 20 gallons/yd 3 (98. 8 L/m 3) has comparable performance to the typical LMC mix design with 24. 5 gallons/yd 3 (121 L/m 3) in terms of compressive and flexural strengths, permeability, and shrinkage. This indicates that the latex cost could be reduced by about 20 % without adverse effect on the major performance characteristics of the LMC overlays...|$|R
