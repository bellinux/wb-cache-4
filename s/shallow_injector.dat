40|$|Favourable {{economics}} of handling {{and application of}} manure are of fundamental importance to encourage the implementation of emission-reducing application techniques. The {{economics of}} manure application depend on {{the costs of the}} equipment and the time to carry out the field operation. In this study the costs of application techniques designed to reduce ammonia losses were assessed and compared with the costs of conventional broadcast spreading across a range of farm characteristics. A model was developed to calculate the costs and time requirements of manure application. Data on factors affecting the costs were used from different countries in Europe. The calculations showed that for a range of farm characteristics with a manure production of 1000 - 3000 m(3) y(- 1), the costs of manure application by trailing hose, trailing foot, <b>shallow</b> <b>injector</b> and arable land injector were approximate to 2 Euro m(- 3) higher than for broadcast spreading. The cost difference between broadcast spreading and the other application techniques decreased with farm size. The average additional costs of manure application by a trailing foot or a <b>shallow</b> <b>injector</b> decreased by 15 % on small extensive farms to more than 50 % on intensive farms, when the fertiliser value of the nitrogen was taken into account. The field application itself took less than 50 % of the operating time in the process of the manure handling and application. With an increasing application rate, the relative contribution of the time for field application decreased. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Shallow {{injection}} of liquid bio solids at depths of 50 – 70 mm into grass and arable crops offers many advantages over existing application methods. However, current shallow injection equipment only places the sludge or slurry into slots leaving it exposed {{with a high}} runoff risk. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the benefits and limitations of injecting digested sewage sludge into land growing arable crops using shallow injection techniques. It is documented in two parts. One part describes the agronomic trials undertaken to determine the effect of application technique and timing on combinable crops. This part describes the work undertaken to understand the mechanics of shallow injection and develop an improved injector design. Here, laboratory and field studies were undertaken to compare both existing and new winged <b>shallow</b> <b>injector</b> designs. These showed that a winged injector penetrated better with an equal or lower draught than existing designs. The design also incorporated the sludge into the soil with minimal crop damage at rates of at least of 50 m 3 ha− 1 when working 50 mm deep...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{spreading}} of slurry {{leads to}} the inevitable emission of ammonia into the environment. Injection of slurry on grassland reduces these emissions. However, injection of slurry by deep working injector tines with goose foot chisels (wings) requires high draught forces. This type of injection has {{the risk of the}} crop dying back under dry soil conditions and is not possible on all soil types. In recent years, new slurry application techniques for grassland have been developed that achieve a large reduction in emissions of ammonia, but require less draught force. These techniques include cutting a shallow slit in the sward, into which slurry is applied, and application of the slurry in bands on the soil surface using a trailing foot implement. In a series of experiments on sandy loam, day and peat soils, the draught force requirement of single elements of five new slurry application techniques was investigated. The application techniques were a trailed sliding foot element and four shallow injection elements: angled-disc coulters (double-disc opener), thick-disc coulter, flat disc coulter followed by a vertical injection coulter and knife coulter followed by a vertical injection coulter. The application technique, working depth and soil conditions had a significant influence on the draught force. For a working depth of 5 cm, the required draught forces per <b>shallow</b> <b>injector</b> element, measured in this experiment, were in the range of 202 - 706 N for a double-disc opener, 284 - 991 N for a thick-disc coulter, 361 - 1260 N for a flat-disc coulter plus injector and 389 - 1358 N for a knife coulter plus injector. The lowest draught forces occurred on peat soil and the highest forces on dry clay. The trailing foot required an average draught force of 39 N. The draught force of the trailing foot did not relate to the soil conditions but an effect of the grass sward condition was suggested. (C) 1998 Silsoe Research Institute...|$|E
40|$|Injection depth has an {{important}} impact {{on the performance of}} a shallow manure injection system. Therefore, it should be maintained within narrow margins. For this purpose, an automatic electro-hydraulic depth control system was developed, which minimises the difference between the actual injection, measured by means of an ultrasonic sensor, and the desired injection depth. To minimise this difference the relative position of the <b>shallow</b> slurry <b>injector</b> attached to the four-point linkage at the back of a manure tanker was changed with respect to this tanker. A grey box model was developed for the conversion of the voltage applied to an electronic control unit into the working depth of a <b>shallow</b> manure <b>injector.</b> A simplified and linearised model based on theoretical considerations was developed. The parameters of this model were estimated by means of frequency-domain identification techniques. This model contained all the dominant dynamics of the system that are relevant for control design. Since the dynamics of the system change during manure application, the worst case with respect to the stability of the depth control system was sought by comparing several extreme situations. The case of an empty tanker with the injector above the ground (minimal soil penetration resistance) was found to be the worst case and the model parameters were determined for this case. The resulting model contains an integrator and is of second order in the numerator, and fourth order in the denominator. Along with the non-linear time delay effect this model was found to be suitable for a model-based design of a stable and accurate injection depth controller. status: publishe...|$|R
