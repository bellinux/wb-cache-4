5|$|Stela 5 is {{reasonably}} well preserved and is inscribed with two Long Count dates flanked by representations of two standing figures portraying rulers. The latest {{of these two}} dates is AD126. The right-hand figure is holding a snake, while the left-hand figure is holding what is probably a jaguar. This monument probably represents one ruler passing power to the next. A small seated figure is carved onto each of the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> stela along with a badly eroded hieroglyphic inscription. The style is early Maya and has affinities with sculptures at Izapa.|$|E
5|$|Members are {{arranged}} in a hemicycle according to their political groups (in the Common Assembly, prior to 1958, members sat alphabetically) who are ordered mainly by left to right, but some smaller groups are placed towards the outer ring of the Parliament. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for translation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the centre, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> area and the MEPs, these are {{taken up by the}} Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg hemicycle roughly follow this layout with only minor differences. The hemicycle design is a compromise between the different Parliamentary systems. The British-based system has the different groups directly facing each other while the French-based system is a semicircle (and the traditional German system had all members in rows facing a rostrum for speeches). Although the design is mainly based on a semicircle, the opposite ends of the spectrum do still face each other. With access to the chamber limited, entrance is controlled by ushers who aid MEPs in the chamber (for example in delivering documents). The ushers can also occasionally act as a form of police in enforcing the President, for example in ejecting an MEP who is disrupting the session (although this is rare). The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, so many of the duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the French Revolution. The 180 ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, dressed in black tails and wearing a silver chain, and are recruited {{in the same manner as}} the European civil service. The President is allocated a personal usher.|$|E

25|$|The task of {{dividing}} plots {{perpendicular to}} the coast was made much easier {{by the fact that}} numerous ravines, difficult to cross, cover Réunion, starting from the heights and striating the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> cone-shaped island.

The downhill flow of the water forms nearly incontestable natural bounds for the property.|$|E

The Folded Zagros (the mountains south of the Elevated Zagros and almost parallel to the main Zagros fault) is formed mainly of Tertiary rocks, with the Paleogene rocks south of the Cretaceous rocks and then the Neogene rocks south of the Paleogene rocks.|$|E

25|$|Although most burials {{initially}} occurred {{near the}} freedmen's cemetery {{in the northeast}} corner of the estate, Meigs ordered in mid-June 1864 that burials commence immediately on the grounds of Arlington House. The first officer burial had occurred next to the main flower garden on May 17, but with Meigs' order another 44 officers were buried along the southern and eastern <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> area within a month. In December 1865, Robert E. Lee's brother, Sydney Smith Lee, visited Arlington House and observed that the house could be made livable again if the graves around the flower garden were removed. Meigs hated Lee for betraying the Union, and ordered that more burials occur near the house {{in order to make it}} politically impossible for disinterment to occur.|$|E

25|$|South of this {{courtyard}} {{lies the}} Palace of Man SinghI, {{which is the}} oldest part of the palace fort. The palace took 25 years to build and was completed in 1599 {{during the reign of}} Raja Man SinghI (1589–1614). It is the main palace. In the central courtyard of the palace is the pillared baradari or pavilion; frescoes and coloured tiles decorate the rooms on the ground and upper floors. This pavilion (which used to be curtained for privacy) was used as the meeting venue by the maharanis (queens of the royal family). All <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> pavilion are connected to several small rooms with open balconies. The exit from this palace leads to the town of Amer, a heritage town with many temples, palatial houses and mosques.|$|E
25|$|The two diagonals {{and the two}} {{tangency}} chords are concurrent. One way to {{see this}} is as a limiting case of Brianchon's theorem, which states that a hexagon all of whose sides are tangent to a single conic section has three diagonals that meet at a point. From a tangential quadrilateral, one can form a hexagon with two 180° angles, by placing two new vertices at two opposite points of tangency; all six of the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> hexagon lie on lines tangent to the inscribed circle, so its diagonals meet at a point. But two of these diagonals {{are the same as}} the diagonals of the tangential quadrilateral, and the third diagonal of the hexagon is the line through two opposite points of tangency. Repeating this same argument with the other two points of tangency completes the proof of the result.|$|E
25|$|The frieze is 113 meters long, {{which makes}} it the longest {{surviving}} frieze of Greek Antiquity after the Parthenon frieze. On the western side it is interrupted by the ca. 20 meter wide stairway, which cuts into the foundation on that side and leads to a superstructure with columns. On both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> stairway there are projections constructed and decorated {{in a manner similar}} to the rest of the encircling frieze. The three-wing superstructure is relatively narrow compared with the base. The pillars surrounding the superstructure have platforms with profiles and Ionic capitals. There are many statues on the roof: a quadriga of horses, lion griffins, centaurs and deities, as well as uncompleted gargoyles. The upper hall gives a spacious impression thanks to the widely spaced columns. An additional columned hall was also planned for the inner courtyard where the fire altar itself was located, but not implemented. A frieze was installed there at eye level depicting the life of the mythical founder of the city, Telephus. Although no remains of paint have been found, it can be assumed that the entire structure was brightly painted in antiquity.|$|E
