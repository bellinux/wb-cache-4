The rights for the English language version of the novel was acquired by Penguin Books, and there was interest in turning the work into a film. In 2015, German graphic novelist Reinhard Kleist published his graphic novel Der Traum von Olympia – Die Geschichte von Samia Yusuf Omar ("An Olympic Dream – The Story of Samia Yusuf Omar") at Carlsen Verlag. It was named the Luchs book {{of the year for}} 2015. The graphic novel was translated into English and published by SelfMadeHero in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{assert that}} naked CDSs should be banned, {{comparing}} them to buying fire insurance on your neighbor’s house, which creates a huge incentive for arson. Analogizing {{to the concept}} of insurable interest, critics <b>say</b> <b>you</b> should not be able to buy a CDS—insurance against default—when you do not own the bond. Short selling is also viewed as gambling and the CDS market as a casino.|$|E

25|$|In a 2004 interview, McVie {{admitted}} to not listening much to pop music anymore and stated instead {{a preference for}} Classic FM. In December 2003, McVie went to see Fleetwood Mac's last UK performance on the <b>Say</b> <b>You</b> Will tour in London, but did not join her former bandmates on stage. Mid-2004 saw the release of McVie's new solo album, In the Meantime, her third in a career spanning five decades. Recording in her converted barn in Kent, she worked on the project with her nephew, Dan Perfect, who contributed guitar-playing, backing vocals, and songwriting. No tour was organized to promote this album; instead McVie conducted several press interviews in both Britain and the United States.|$|E
25|$|The American $100 {{bill has}} some competition, {{primarily}} from the €500 note. The larger value of the banknote {{makes it easier to}} transport larger amounts of money. As an example, $1 million in currency in $100 bills weighs 22 pounds, if, <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> were to carry it on board an airplane. It is difficult to carry this much money without a briefcase and some physical security. The same amount in €500 notes would weigh less than three pounds, and it could probably be dispersed in clothing and in luggage without attracting attention or alerting a security device. For many illegal operations, the problem of transporting currency is more difficult than transporting cocaine because of the size and weight of the currency. The ease of transporting banknotes makes the euro very attractive to Latin American drug cartels.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Stapleton, Debra Byrne and Lisa Edwards toured with Girls, Girls, Girls {{a tribute}} show of hits by The Supremes, Cilla Black, Springfield, Patsy Cline and Lulu.

Stapleton's television roles include Trixie Tucker, the mother of Nina Tucker played by Delta Goodrem, on Neighbours during 2002 and 2003; other TV roles have been on Blue Heelers (1996, 1999) and Halifax f.p. (1996). Stapleton appeared on film in You Don't Have to <b>Say</b> <b>You</b> Love Me, a short by Terrence O'Connell. During June–August 2006, Norton and Stapleton performed in the Countdown Spectacular alongside other 1970s and 1980s acts.

25|$|It is such {{a curious}} position, hollow and rotten to the heart’s core, to have made all over the State large uncomfortable {{communities}} of people whom you call refugees and <b>say</b> <b>you</b> are protecting, but who call themselves prisoners of war, compulsorily detained, and detesting your protection. They are tired of being told by officers that they are refugees under “the kind and beneficient protection of the British”. In most cases there is no pretence that there was treachery, or ammunition concealed, or food given or anything. It was just that an order was given to empty the country. Though the camps are called refugee, there are in reality a very few of these–perhaps only half-a-dozen in some camps. It is easy to tell them, because they are put in the best marquees, and have had time given to them to bring furniture and clothes, and are mostly self-satisfied and vastly superior people. Very few, if any of them, are in want.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about getting [...] "the rules {{straight}} on a budding relationship: Slow down and don't <b>say</b> <b>you</b> love me until you give me some time {{and get to know}} me." [...] According to musicologist Jon Mikkel Broch Ålvik, [...] "Don't <b>Say</b> <b>You</b> Love Me" [...] is the [...] "thinking person's teen pop." [...] Ålvik rejects a superficial interpretation that the lyrics are a [...] "moralistic message of abstinence", arguing instead that M2M [...] "signal a stance that sounds considered and assured rather than prudish" [...] and that {{the song is}} a statement of [...] "burgeoning agency." [...] The song has been described as bubblegum pop music with similar lyrical qualities to songs by girl groups of the 1960s, while also having more influence from rock and singer-songwriter genres than was typical for other teen pop songs of the late 1990s.|$|E

[...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise.
