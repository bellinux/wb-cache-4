5|$|At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, {{reported}} entering northern Iraq to the AWACS controller {{responsible for}} air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using {{was different from}} the en-route frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and being able to <b>see</b> <b>both</b> Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired {{to the back of the}} airplane at 10:00 to take a nap.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914 delayed the start of Amundsen's northern polar drift—to which the South Pole expedition had been intended as a preliminary—until July1918. He then set off in a specially-constructed vessel, Maud, which remained in Arctic waters {{for the next seven}} years. The ship did not drift over the North Pole, although {{in the course of the}} expedition it became the second ship to traverse the North-East Passage. Amundsen left the expedition in 1923; the remaining years of his life were largely devoted to polar exploration by air. On 12May 1926, aboard the airship Norge with Lincoln Ellsworth and Umberto Nobile, Amundsen flew over the North Pole. He and Wisting, also on the airship, were the first men to <b>see</b> <b>both</b> poles. In 1928, while attempting to rescue a later Nobile expedition, Amundsen disappeared with his aircraft in the seas between Norway and Spitsbergen.|$|E

5|$|Rey Hechicero {{made his}} debut on February 15, 2001, {{in his home}} town of Monterrey, Nuevo León working for a local wrestling promotion. In 2004, he was listed as having worked a number of matches for the Naucalpan, State of Mexico based International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) but did not tour {{extensively}} outside Nuevo León. In 2007, Rey Hechicero became involved in a storyline feud against another local Monterrey wrestler called Gitano del Norte ("The Gypsy of the North"), a storyline that led to both men putting their masks on the line {{on the outcome of}} a Lucha de Apuestas ("Bet match"). Rey Hechicero won and forced his opponent to unmask, which in Lucha Libre is considered more prestigious than winning championships. He capped 2007 by defeating Tigre Universitario to win the WWA World Middleweight Championship Defeating Tigre Universitario for the championship was part of a long running storyline between the two, a storyline that would <b>see</b> <b>both</b> of them involved in a four-man Lucha de Apuesta on March 23, 2008. Both Rey Hechicero and Tigre Universitario escaped from the match with their masks while Valiente pinned Sergio Romo, Jr. to force Romo to be shaved bald after the match since he was not masked.|$|E

25|$|Guide {{books and}} travel {{accounts}} with {{details of the}} country and people have had a long history - some books from the 19th century and early 20th century being classics with description of places that were perceived as things to <b>see.</b> <b>Both</b> private authors and government publications (such as the 1920s Come to Java books produced in Batavia by the government tourist bureau of the time) have been made each decade through to the present.

James Rush's and Adrian Vickers' texts mentioned below are excellent introductions to the range of writing that has been created.|$|E

25|$|Callwell’s 2 volume “Life and Diaries” in 1927 damaged Wilson’s {{reputation}} – the “New Statesman” {{thought they}} showed {{him to be}} “the typically stupid militarist…fundamentally a fool” Sir Charles Deedes, who had studied under him at Staff College and later served on his staff, commented that Wilson came across in the diaries as “an ambitious, volatile and even fatuous character, an intriguer concerned mainly with his own career” {{and that this was}} “far from the truth” – Deedes commented that Wilson’s ability to <b>see</b> <b>both</b> sides of a question and inability to make a decision and stick to it made him a poor corps commander but a “patient, lucid and fair” adviser. Lloyd George’s view in his own “War Memoirs” was essentially similar, although he wrote that Wilson was reluctant to take responsibility for decisions.|$|E
