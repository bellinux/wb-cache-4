Tara NP was {{nominated}} in 2004 within the UNESCO - ROSTE programme, for Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Reserve status in Serbia as transboundary 'Peace Park' status between Serbia and Bosnia & Herzegovina. Mt. Tara {{is one of}} the most important centres of Balkans and European ecosystems and species diversity. They represent a unique example of well preserved forests in south eastern Europe with numerous endemic and relict species of flora and fauna. In this floristic diversity of Mt Tara of the greatest interest is the <b>Serbian</b> (Pančić's) <b>spruce</b> Picea omorika. Mt.

The geographical information system (GIS) that we have created has proved an excellent tool for the spatial planning strategy in assessment and conservation of all natural characteristics of Mt.

The Norway spruce, <b>Serbian</b> <b>spruce,</b> Scotch pine, and Turkish fir are not native to the United States.

It is also grown to a small extent in forestry for Christmas trees, timber and paper production, particularly in northern Europe, though its slow growth makes it less important than Sitka spruce or Norway spruce. In cultivation, it has produced hybrids with the closely related Black spruce and also with Sitka spruce.|$|E

Because of its rarity and scientific importance, it has been placed under national protection as {{it can only be}} found on two locations on Tara: the canyon of the Mileševka river and on the Zvezda massif. Oldest trees in the park are the beeches, and in total there are 1,200 plant species in the park, of which 84 are Balkans endemites, and 600 species of fungi. There are two species of edelweiss which can be found in Serbia only on the Tara. Pančić discovered the Derventa knapweed (Centaurea derventana) on the cliffs of the Derventa canyon, while Alpine edelweiss habitats only one ridge on Mokra Gora and is strictly protected.

The seed originated from the three populations that represent the overall ecological and productive conditions of <b>Serbian</b> <b>spruce</b> populations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Two natural populations were selected: Veliki Stolac and Gostilj, and one planted forest population in Srebrenica. The cones were collected in late autumn 2009 and early spring 2010. They were collected from five trees from Srebrenica and Gostilj, and seven trees from Veliki Stolac. Immediately after they were collected, the cones and seeds were processed and germination tests were done. Germination, germination viability and germination dynamics were studied in three categories of seed treatment: 1) control unit (just processed seed), 2) seed stored for six months at 0 - 4 ºC, 3) seed stored for seven months at 0 - 4 º C and treated with fungicide after five months of storing. The number of germinated seed was observed and noted on the third, fourth, fifth, seventh, tenth, fourteenth, twenty-first and twenty-eighth day. There were significant differences in germination dynamics at the population level and the level of treatment during the first couple of days of germination test. Fungicide (captan) acted as an inhibitor on seed germination process. The seeds originating from the largest population of Veliki Stolac showed the best response to storing treatment with fungicide related to germination dynamics. The seed originating from Srebrenica andkept at low temperatures 0 - 4 °C without treatment with fungicides showed the best result in germination.
