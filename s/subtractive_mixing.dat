50|$|By convention, {{the three}} primary colors in <b>subtractive</b> <b>mixing</b> are yellow, magenta and cyan; however, {{for a long}} time {{painters}} have used yellow, red and blue in place of these. In <b>subtractive</b> <b>mixing</b> of color, the absence of color is white and the presence of all three primary colors is black. The secondary colors are the same as the primary colors from additive mixing, and vice versa. This is not an accident. By mixing additive secondary colors subtractively one can reachieve the primary additive colors. <b>Subtractive</b> <b>mixing</b> is used to create a variety of colors when printing on paper by combining a small number of ink colors, and also when painting. Green is a part of mixing yellow and blue. Orange is a part of mixing red and yellow. Purple is a part of mixing blue and red.|$|E
50|$|The {{additive}} mixing of colors is unintuitive {{as it does}} not correspond to the mixing of physical substances (such as paint) which would correspond to <b>subtractive</b> <b>mixing.</b> For instance, one can additively mix yellow and blue by shining yellow light together with blue light, which will result in not green but a white light.

40|$|The {{preservation}} of cultural heritage and treatment thereof are delicate responsibilities that demand {{the best possible}} technologies and extreme care to avoid any irreversible loss. It necessitates a deep understanding of constituent materials, along with the analytical methods and cutting-edge technologies. Considering this direction, {{the goal of this}} dissertation is to promote the conservation procedures by providing an applicable workflow for spectral-based pigment identification. The proposed pipeline is a novel and practical aid for museum conservators for many aspects, such as inpainting, treatment and archiving of artwork. Spectral-based pigment identification algorithms rely on accurate spectral data, a <b>subtractive</b> <b>mixing</b> model and an effective unmixing algorithm. In this dissertation, the spectral data were obtained using a spectral image acquisition system as a feasible and non-destructive technique. A liquid-crystal tunable filter (LCTF) and a CCD camera were used for spectral measurement of the painting. The spectral accuracy and precision of the LCTF-based spectral acquisition system were assessed and enhanced. Of the common factors affecting the acquisition performance, capturing geometry, LCTF angular dependencies and spectral characterization algorithm were new contributions to the traditional workflow. The complexity of subtractive mixtures limits the effective application of linear unmixing algorithms for pigment identification. Accordingly, a new linear modification of single-constant Kubelka-Munk theory was derived to enable the use of available linear spectral unmixing algorithms for paint mixtures. A selection of geometric and iterative-based unmixing algorithms was applied to the LCTF spectral images in the <b>subtractive</b> <b>mixing</b> space using the defined subtractive linear model. Final sets of primary pigments were improved employing a pre-existing database of common pigments as a tool for practical inpainting procedures. The pigment maps, showing the concentration of each pigment per pixel, and RMS error images were calculated after estimating the primary pigments. The estimation errors and the performance of the pigment selection algorithms were assessed using 23 validation paintings. Finally, the primary pigment information combined with multi-spectral images from a commercial 6 -channel imaging system was used for visualization and high-resolution spectral image reproductions...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{preliminary}} investigation towards the design of effective colour spaces and colour tools to allow users to quickly and accurately select a given colour in a digital-display environment. It {{has been shown that}} many non-expert users find the RGB colour space to be non-intuitive. The choice of colour space on various visual tasks has also been shown to be an important factor and that experts show greater precision in colour-matching experiments than non-expert observers. We propose that non-experts find manipulation and selection in an RGB colour space to be difficult because they do not possess an appropriate internal model for additive colour mixing. On the other hand, observers from a young age may develop a useful internal model of subtractive colour mixing processes as they experiment with inks and paints. The purpose of this work is to determine whether it is indeed the case that observers possess more useful internal models for subtractive colour mixing than for additive colour mixing. The work reported in this study describes only an assessment of subtractive colour mixing. Three experiments are described whereby expert and naïve observers select matches from a library of colours for individual samples or for imagined subtractive mixtures of paint samples. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are presented to measure the ability of observers to make predictions of <b>subtractive</b> <b>mixing</b> processes.

40|$|A color-picker or color-selection tool {{is part of}} a GUI {{that allows}} users to select colors for use in {{software}} applications. There is a widespread belief that some color spaces or models are more “natural ” than others. However, this intuitively appealing idea that a color space based on the nature of color perception (such as HSL) may be preferable to one that is driven {{by the nature of the}} technology (such as RGB) has not been confirmed by all studies. In this paper we argue that it is not the color space per se that is the most important factor underlying the usability of a colorselection tool but rather the color-mixing algorithm. An experiment was conducted to determine matching performance in a color-selection tool where the sliders interacted with the on-screen color using either a direct additive model or an indirect subtractive model to control the RGB values of the on-screen color. When observers were given a limited amount of time to use the sliders to match target colors their performance was statistically superior when they used the subtractive CMY sliders than when they used the additive RGB sliders. This is consistent with some previous work that suggests that observers possess better internal models of <b>subtractive</b> <b>mixing</b> than additive mixing and that the design of color-selection tools could exploit this. It should be noted that this work differs from some related work that has looked at the influence of color space on the usability of colorselection tools. Our hypothesis is that it is the color-mixing model that relates the slider bars to the on-screen color that is important rather than the choice of color space itself...|$|E
40|$|This study {{enhances the}} {{capability}} to reproduce multi-coloured images in woven Jacquard forms where weave structure and pattern design were considerably involved in fabrication. In modern weaving, great convenience and efficiencies were established in both production and design process through digitalisation, while the colour adoption has been constrained as the applicable number of figuring yarns were limited. The enhancement toward colour realisation is traditionally related to weaving capability. Surface colour display is dominated by additive, subtractive or optical mixing (Mathur, 2007). An additive colour system offers the largest gamut among output models yet, the light mixing principle is not suitable to apply to weave colour creation. Pre-dyed opaque yarns are used and juxtaposed; small particles of yarn colours reflect lights and they were observed as a certain form of colour. The common and crucial criterial pertinent to an optical mixing of weave colours were aligned more with the <b>subtractive</b> <b>mixing</b> principle. A weave pattern was designed by subtractive primary colour classification and a multi-weft figuring method. Secondary colours are theoretically produced when coupled CMY layers are mixed(i. e., cyan + magenta = blue, cyan + yellow = green, magenta + yellow = red) and black is generated when all CMY primaries are mixed (Berns, 2000);however, non-bendable colours of threads are employed for colour reproduction in weaving {{and there is a}} limit to adopt a pigment mixing principle in the woven form. Therefore, each weave pattern required a modification to redefine primary colour regions and densities once an original artwork was separated and presented in greyscales levels. The weave patterns in an original subtractive scheme were altered by applying region-based segmentation to maximise the accessible colour gamut. In this study, the weaving application developed for the multi-coloured image was introduced and the design process was explained based on a practical experiment proceeded with a newly developed weaving application...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} <b>subtractive</b> color <b>mixing</b> widely used in color hardcopy applications and shows that a more realistic concept would be " spectral mixing " : the physical description of the coloration of light by printed surfaces comes from the mixing of light components selectively absorbed by inks or dyes during their patch within the printing materials. Some classical reflectance equations for continuous tone and halftone prints are reviewed and considered as spectral mixing laws. The challenge of extending these models to new inkless printing processes based on laser radiation is also addressed. Color mixing is a key-concept in color reproduction, either by painting, printing, or displaying. It refers to the observation that a large panel of colors (the color gamut) {{can be achieved by}} varying the amount of a limited set of base colors, called primaries. With light emitting systems, the primaries are light sources, often with red, green and blue color, that are either superposed or juxtaposed with a shorter period than the visual acuity. Since the tristimulus values of the produced colors is a linear, additive combination of the tristimulus values of the three primaries, this type of color mixing has been called additive color mixing. This concept, based on Grassman's additivity law, enabled the color matching experiments at the basis of colorimetry [1]. In opposition to the light emitting systems, paintings and printed hardcopies selectively attenuate the incident white light in different proportions according to the wavelength. Layers of primaries, paints or inks, are coated on a reflecting support and play a role of spectral filtering of light. This type of color mixing is improperly called <b>subtractive</b> color <b>mixing</b> [2], by reference to the fact that part of the incident light is removed by filtering, but the tristimulus values of paint or ink mixtures cannot be obtained by combining the tristimulus values of the primaries; it is therefore not a color mixing in the sense of colorimetry. However, the <b>subtractive</b> color <b>mixing</b> is also related to a physical experience, which consists in producing many colors by mixing nonscattering dyes, usually of cyan, magenta and yellow color.

50|$|The {{mixing of}} colored {{physical}} substances corresponds to <b>subtractive</b> color <b>mixing,</b> hence it corresponds to our intuition about mixing colors. To explain the mechanism, {{let us consider}} mixing red paint with yellow paint. The red paint is red because when the ambient light strikes it, {{the composition of the}} material is such that it absorbs all other colors in the visible spectrum except for red. The red light, not being absorbed, reflects off the paint and is what we see. This same mechanism describes the color of all material objects -- note that light is not a material object -- and so applies to the yellow paint as well. Making recourse to the figure above demonstrating additive color mixing, one sees that yellow light is composed of an (additive) mixture of red and green light. When we mix the two paints, the resulting substance has red paint and yellow paint. The yellow paint absorbs all colors except for red and green. However, the red paint will absorb the green reflected by the yellow paint. The red paint can be said to subtract the green from the yellow paint. The resulting paint reflects only red light and so appears red to our eyes. Note however that this description is theoretical and that the mixing of pigments does not correspond to ideal <b>subtractive</b> color <b>mixing</b> because some light from the subtracted color is still being reflected by one component of the original paint. This results in a darker and desaturated color compared to the color that would be achieved with ideal filters.|$|R

50|$|Across {{the same}} period, {{industrial}} chemistry radically expanded the color range of lightfast synthetic pigments, allowing for substantially improved saturation in color mixtures of dyes, paints and inks. It also created the dyes and chemical processes necessary for color photography. As a result, three-color printing became aesthetically and economically feasible in mass printed media, and the artists' color theory was adapted to primary colors {{most effective in}} inks or photographic dyes: cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY). (In printing, dark colors are supplemented by a black ink, known as the CMYK system; in both printing and photography, white {{is provided by the}} color of the paper.) These CMY primary colors were reconciled with the RGB primaries, and <b>subtractive</b> color <b>mixing</b> with additive color mixing, by defining the CMY primaries as substances that absorbed only one of the retinal primary colors: cyan absorbs only red (−R+G+B), magenta only green (+R−G+B), and yellow only blue violet (+R+G−B). It is important to add that the CMYK, or process, color printing is meant as an economical way of producing a wide range of colors for printing, but is deficient in reproducing certain colors, notably orange and slightly deficient in reproducing purples. A wider range of color can be obtained with the addition of other colors to the printing process, such as in Pantone's Hexachrome printing ink system (six colors), among others.|$|R
