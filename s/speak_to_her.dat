5|$|Elizabeth {{was held}} in the YMCA for nearly 200days, during which time the Kempeitai meticulously {{followed}} up every point in her story, cross-examining people she said she had helped. After a huge dossier of interviews had been compiled, the Japanese concluded that she was telling the truth and set her free. Khun Heng, however, was sentenced to 12years in Outram Road Prison. People avoided Elizabeth following her release, too terrified to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Fifteen internees died in the Kempeitais cells during the Double Tenth inquisition. The suffering spread to the entire civilian population of Changi Prison; rations were cut, and games, concerts, plays, and school lessons were forbidden for months.|$|E

5|$|With The Legacy finally formed, Manu and Snuka {{still wanted}} revenge on Orton. Fearing {{they would try}} to {{convince}} Raw general manager Stephanie McMahon to fire him, Orton went to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> himself but their conversation ended in an argument. When Vince McMahon, Stephanie's father, made his return that night Orton maintained he was owed an apology. His brashness angered McMahon who responded by trying to fire Orton, but before he could finish his sentence Orton slapped McMahon and gave him a running punt which left him hospitalized in the storyline. During the 30-man Royal Rumble match that Sunday the group worked as a team, making them three of the last four contestants in the ring with Triple H as the other. Ultimately, in throwing out Rhodes and DiBiase, Triple H was distracted enough to allow Orton to throw him over the top rope and win the match. The next evening on Raw, The Legacy came to the ring accompanied by lawyers and doctors, with Orton explaining his outburst against McMahon was a result of intermittent explosive disorder (IED) and threatened to sue the company and cancel WrestleMania XXV if he was fired, as winning the Rumble guaranteed him a championship match at WrestleMania. Instead he was booked for a no holds barred match with Vince's son, Shane, at No Way Out in February, which Orton won. The night after the event, they fought again until Orton punted Shane unconscious. Stephanie McMahon came to the ring to oversee her brother being carried away by the paramedics and shouted at Orton until he performed an RKO, his finishing move, to her.Triple H ran to the ring and chased away the group, standing over the body of Stephanie McMahon.The next week,Orton and The Legacy attacked Triple H.When Stephanie came out to stop The Legacy,Orton attacked and made out with her before hitting Triple H with a sledgehammer.|$|E

25|$|At the {{parliament}} of 1789 Gustav III united the other estates against the nobility {{and to gain}} {{support for the war}} and for his constitutional reform. Coming into conflict with the nobility, he had many of its representatives imprisoned. This act lead to a social boycott of the monarch by the female members of the aristocracy, who followed the example of Jeanna von Lantingshausen as well as the King's sister and sister-in-law, Sophie Albertine of Sweden and Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte. The Queen did not participate in this political demonstration and refused to allow any talk of politics in her presence. She was nevertheless involved in the conflict. When the King informed his son about the event, he discovered the child to be already informed in other ways than what he had intended. He suspected Sophia Magdalena to be responsible, and asked the governor of the prince, Count Nils Gyldenstolpe, to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Gyldenstolpe, however, sent one of the king's favorites, Baron Erik Boye. The Queen, who despised the favorites of the King, furiously told Boye that she spoke to her son how she wished and that only her contempt for him prevented her from having him thrown out of the window. She was known to dislike the reforms of 1789, and she did let it be known to its representatives. At the celebrations of the Victory at Fredrikshamn in 1790, she refused to be escorted by riksråd Count Joakim Beck-Friis, who was in favor of the reform, and demanded to be escorted by Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, who was in opposition to it.|$|E

500|$|Deal got {{the idea}} for the album's name from a {{painting}} that she saw in Boston. Pods cover was designed by Vaughan Oliver with photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, and performed a fertility dance while Westenberg took pictures of him, using a long exposure. Oliver's inspiration included the need for [...] "a strong male response" [...] (via the [...] "phallic" [...] eels) to the music of the mostly female Breeders. Another motivation was his attempt to charm Kim Deal, and <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> sense of humor, as he had become enamored with her.|$|E
