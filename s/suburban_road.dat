500|$|Route 41 is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It runs [...] from the five-way {{intersection}} of Route 47 (Delsea Drive), County Route 603 (Fairview-Sewell Road/Blackswood-Barnsboro Road), and County Route 630 (Egg Harbor Road), also known as Five Points, in Deptford Township, Gloucester County to the southern terminus of County Route 611 in Maple Shade, Burlington County, {{just north of the}} Route 41's interchanges with Route 38 and Route 73. The route is a two- to four-lane <b>suburban</b> <b>road</b> that passes through several communities, including Runnemede, Haddonfield, and Cherry Hill Township. Between the intersection with Route 168 in Runnemede and Route 154 in Cherry Hill Township, Route 41 is maintained by Camden County and is also signed as County Route 573.|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{attributed the}} C5's failure to problems with Sinclair's marketing strategy; {{only a year}} after the demise of Sinclair Vehicles, the Globe and Mail newspaper called it [...] "one of the great marketing bombs of postwar British industry". Andrew P. Marks of Paisley College of Technology criticises Sinclair's marketing strategy as confused; the C5 promotional brochure depicts it as a leisure vehicle, showing boys in C5s at a football pitch, women in C5s on a <b>suburban</b> <b>road,</b> and so on, while the text suggests that the C5 is a serious substitute for a car. He concludes that the C5 was poorly defined, appearing to be [...] "trying to grasp at two different markets" [...] but was unable to appeal to either, and so failed to take off. The fact that it was initially only available via mail order was also a mistake, in Marks' view, as it meant that no physical inspection of the product could be made before purchasing it. This was a serious deterrent to consumers as it made the C5 a much more risky purchase.|$|E
60|$|Her {{life became}} insupportably dreary; {{she could not}} take walks, and had no {{interest}} in going for drives, or, indeed, in travelling anywhere. Nearly two years passed without an event, and still she looked on that <b>suburban</b> <b>road,</b> thinking of the village in which she had been born, and whither she would have gone back--O how gladly!--even to work in the fields.|$|E

60|$|Neither {{looking to}} the right nor the left, neither knowing nor caring whither he went, Matthew Grice took the first turning he came to, which led him out of Baregrove Square. It {{happened}} to be the street communicating with the long <b>suburban</b> <b>road,</b> at the remote extremity of which Mr. Blyth lived. Mat followed this road mechanically, not casting a glance at the painter's abode when he passed it, and taking no notice of a cab, with luggage on the roof; which drew up, as he walked by, at the garden gate. If he had only looked round at the vehicle for a moment, he must have seen Valentine sitting inside it, and counting out the money for his fare.|$|E
6000|$|Smoothly and gracefully, {{carefully}} {{preserving the}} speckless integrity of her dress, never hastening her pace, and never looking aside {{to the right}} hand or the left, Miss Gwilt pursued her way toward the open country. The <b>suburban</b> <b>road</b> branched off at its end in two directions. On the left, the path wound through a ragged little coppice to the grazing grounds of a neighboring farm; on the right, it led across a hillock of waste land to the high-road. Stopping a moment to consider, but not showing the spy that she suspected him by glancing behind her while there was a hiding-place within his reach, Miss Gwilt took the path across the hillock. [...] "I'll catch him there," [...] she said to herself, looking up quietly at the long straight line of the empty high-road.|$|E
60|$|So {{she stopped}} on alone for her dark hour in Perugia. She stopped on, untended by any save unknown Italians whose tongue she hardly spoke, and uncheered by a {{friendly}} {{voice at the}} deepest moment of trouble in a woman's history. Often for hours together she sat alone in the cathedral, gazing up at a certain mild-featured Madonna, enshrined above an altar. The unwedded widow seemed to gain some comfort from the pitying face of the maiden mother. Every day, while still she could, she walked out along the shadeless <b>suburban</b> <b>road</b> to Alan's grave in the parched and crowded cemetery. Women trudging along with crammed creels on their backs turned round to stare at her. When {{she could no longer}} walk, she sat at her window towards San Luca and gazed at it. There lay the only friend she possessed in Perugia, perhaps in the universe.|$|E

60|$|Again I {{passed over}} the scene of my daily pilgrimage, always to the same shrine, for a whole year; and now, for the first time, I {{knew that there was}} hardly a spot along the entire way, which my heart had not unconsciously made {{beautiful}} and beloved to me by some association with Margaret Sherwin. Here was the friendly, familiar shop-window, filled with the glittering trinkets which had so often lured me in to buy presents for her, {{on my way to the}} house. There was the noisy street corner, void of all adornment in itself, but once bright to me with the fairy-land architecture of a dream, because I knew that at that place I had passed over half the distance which separated my home from hers. Farther on, the Park trees came in sight--trees that no autumn decay or winter nakedness could make dreary, in the bygone time; for she and I had walked under them together. And further yet, was the turning which led from the long, <b>suburban</b> <b>road</b> into Hollyoake Square--the lonely, dust-whitened place, around which my past happiness and my wasted hopes had flung their golden illusions, like jewels hung round the coarse wooden image of a Roman saint. Dishonoured and ruined, it was among such associations as these--too homely to have been recognised by me in former times--that I journeyed along the well-remembered way to North Villa.|$|E

50|$|Historically, National Routes {{passed through}} city centres and formed {{some of the}} main {{thoroughfares}} within Australia's largest cities. However urban growth led to massive congestion in the inner city areas.

The earliest scheme was adopted in Sydney in 1964, the Ring Road scheme. They had special markers for identification.|$|R
