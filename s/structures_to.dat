The town's {{railroad}} infrastructure included a five-stall roundhouse, depot, machine shop, and <b>structures</b> <b>to</b> restock passing trains with sand, coal and water. Non-railroad infrastructure included general stores, a post office, barber shop, saloon, pool hall, bakeries and restaurants. The largest building was a two-story schoolhouse, built in 1911.|$|E

5|$|In the book, Lamarck named two {{supposed}} {{laws that}} would enable animal species to acquire characteristics {{under the influence of}} the environment. The first law stated that use or disuse would cause body <b>structures</b> <b>to</b> grow or shrink over the generations. The second law asserted that such changes would be inherited. Those conditions together imply that species continuously change by adaptation to their environments, forming a branching series of evolutionary paths.|$|E
5|$|In these {{countries}} {{there is little}} need, and no option but for ewes to lamb outdoors as there are insufficient <b>structures</b> <b>to</b> handle the large flocks of ewes there. New Zealand ewes produce 36 million lambs each spring time, which is an average of 2,250 lambs per farm. Australian graziers, too, do not receive the financial support that governments in other countries provide to sheep breeders. Low-cost sheep breeding is based on large numbers of sheep per labour unit and having ewes {{that are capable of}} unsupervised lambing to produce hardy, active lambs.|$|E

5|$|The city's first {{stone was}} laid by Grand Master Jean de Valette on 28 March 1566, {{and the new}} city was called Valletta in his honour. The city walls {{were among the first}} <b>structures</b> <b>to</b> be built within the city, and were largely {{complete}} by the 1570s. Some changes were made to the design while the city was being constructed, and only two cavaliers were constructed, while the arsenal and Manderaggio were never built. Fort St. Elmo, which had been severely damaged in the 1565 siege, was also rebuilt and integrated in the city walls.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their <b>structures</b> <b>to</b> {{be solved by}} x-ray crystallography. This was first done for lysozyme, an enzyme found in tears, saliva and egg whites that digests the coating of some bacteria; the structure was solved by a group led by David Chilton Phillips and published in 1965. This high-resolution structure of lysozyme {{marked the beginning of}} the field of structural biology and the effort to understand how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail.|$|E
5|$|The first protein <b>structures</b> <b>to</b> {{be solved}} were {{hemoglobin}} and myoglobin, by Max Perutz and Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, respectively, in 1958. , the Protein Data Bank has over 126,060 atomic-resolution structures of proteins.

5|$|The outputs of a {{structural}} alignment are a superposition {{of the atomic}} coordinate sets and a minimal {{root mean square deviation}} (RMSD) between the structures. The RMSD of two aligned structures indicates their divergence from one another. Structural alignment can be complicated by the existence of multiple protein domains within {{one or more of the}} input structures, because changes in relative orientation of the domains between two <b>structures</b> <b>to</b> be aligned can artificially inflate the RMSD.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} settlers built a large two-story structure at {{the center}} of the settlement. The ground floor was divided into three rooms: one for La Salle, one for the priests, and one for the officers of the expedition. The upper story consisted of a single room used to store supplies. Surrounding the fort were several smaller <b>structures</b> <b>to</b> provide shelter for the other members of the expedition. The eight cannons, each weighing , had been salvaged from L'Aimable and were positioned around the colony for protection.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Bank, {{which was}} {{completely}} below ground, all stations had buildings designed by Harry Bell Measures. They were single-storey <b>structures</b> <b>to</b> allow for future commercial development above and had elevations faced in beige terracotta. Each station had lifts manufactured by the Sprague Electric Company in New York. The lifts were provided {{in a variety}} of sizes and configurations to suit the passenger flow at each station. Generally they operated in sets of two or three in a shared shaft. Station tunnel walls were finished in plain white ceramic tiles and lit by electric arc lamps. The electricity to run the trains and the stations was supplied from the power station at Wood Lane at 5,000V AC which was converted at sub-stations along the route to 550V DC to power the trains via a third rail system.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{importance}} of tourism to the Croatian economy, areas frequented by tourists (or near major tourist routes) have been given priority for demining. Other safety-related areas receiving demining priority are settlements, commercial and industrial facilities and all documented minefields. Agricultural land, infrastructure and forests are grouped in three priority categories depending on their economic significance. National parks in Croatia were also demined as top-priority areas, along with areas significant for fire protection. Theft of minefield signs is a significant problem, and is particularly pronounced in areas with concerns among the local population that the signs harm tourism. The signs are regularly replaced, sometimes with concrete or masonry <b>structures</b> <b>to</b> display them instead of metal poles. Since the 1990s, only one tourist has been injured by a land mine in Croatia.|$|E
