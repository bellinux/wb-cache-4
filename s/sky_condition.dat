40|$|AbstractGlobal solar {{irradiance}} measurement {{is used for}} applications such as verifying satellite measurements, studying the distribution and variation of the received radiation or estimating the energy yield of solar plants. This measurement is directly influenced by the reference calibration coefficient of the field pyranometer used. The radiometer calibration laboratory of CENER is accredited by ENAC (Spanish National Accreditation Body) since 2010 according to ISO 9847 : 1992 for the calibration of field pyranometers via comparison to a reference pyranometer. The accreditation's scope covers calibrations “type Ia” (outdoor horizontal calibrations for meteorological and resource measurements, part 5. 2. 2, annex B. 2). For the outdoor calibration, the methodology takes different <b>sky</b> <b>conditions</b> into account: stable cloudless <b>sky</b> <b>conditions,</b> unstable <b>sky</b> <b>conditions</b> with some clouds or cloudy <b>sky</b> <b>conditions.</b> The classification criteria described by the standard have been enhanced by CENER for an easier application, establishing additional radiometric conditions, especially for unstable <b>sky</b> <b>conditions</b> with some clouds. Detailed criteria are based on CENER's experience in solar collector testing and on the experimental CENER BSRN station (Baseline Surface Radiation Network) measurements and total sky camera images. During laboratory activity, several calibration coefficient results have been analyzed in order to validate the three methodologies regarding the before mentioned <b>sky</b> <b>conditions.</b> The calibration coefficient can be slightly different depending on the <b>sky</b> <b>conditions</b> and the calibration methodology; therefore global solar irradiation measurements can differ too. The influence of this dependency has been evaluated in order to estimate the monthly and yearly global solar irradiation...|$|R
40|$|As {{daylight}} is dynamic, {{there is}} no one common solution for all scenarios. Understanding of <b>sky</b> <b>conditions</b> is the fundamental to effective daylighting. It is more critical in tropical climate where the sky is predominantly intermediate with inconsistent presence of direct sunlight (DSL). Thereby, daylighting performances of several light shelf configurations were experimented with physical scaled model under actual tropical <b>sky</b> <b>conditions.</b> External illuminance and indoor work plane illuminance (WPI) levels were measured concurrently in a reference model and a test model for comparisons. Daylight ratio or daylight factor and WPI uniformity ratio were computed for analysis. From the results, different optimum cases were identified for various <b>sky</b> <b>conditions.</b> Light shelves performed the best under intermediate sky with DSL from low angle. The highest improvement in WPI at deep room area and WPI uniformity were 24. 87 % and 364. 96 %, respectively. The performances of light shelves under overcast sky were better than light shelf under intermediate sky without DSL. This paper concluded that designing light shelf by responding to changeable <b>sky</b> <b>conditions</b> and DSL is more crucial than considering the façade orientations. Dynamic light shelf was proposed to configure the optimum cases for each tropical <b>sky</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Automatic target {{detection}} of {{surface to air}} surveillance and tracking systems in video applications is an important issue, {{because it is the}} first step for track initiation and continuity. Target detection can be readily overcome for clear <b>sky</b> <b>conditions,</b> but it may be a complicated problem for cloudy <b>sky</b> <b>conditions.</b> In order to fulfill automatic target detection by using conventional image processing techniques may be a hard problem in cloudy <b>sky</b> <b>conditions</b> and improper light affects. The difficulty comes from the clutter rates stem from clouds, and the target may get lost in the clutters that occupies in the whole frame area. In order to increase the detection possibility background clutters should be eliminated by using image processing techniques frame by frame. In this work a novel approach is proposed to detect air vehicles in every kind of cloudy <b>sky</b> <b>conditions.</b> For this purpose a wavelet based image enhancement algorithm is implemented to the video frames, then conventional techniques are used. These conventional techniques are the reciprocal pixel intensity measurement data usage, Sobel operator and thresholding processes for edge detection. The proposed algorithm gives outstanding results for flying object detection in different <b>sky</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} algorithm {{by combining}} {{the advantages of the}} wavelet covariance method and the improved maximum variance method was developed to determine the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) measurements, and an aerosol fraction threshold was applied to the integrated algorithm considering the applicability of the two methods. We compared the CALIOP retrieval with the measurements of PBLH derived from nine years of ground-based Lidar synchronous observations located in Lille, north of France. The results indicate that a good correlation (R≥ 0. 79) exists between the PBLHs derived from CALIOP and ground-based Lidar under clear <b>sky</b> <b>conditions.</b> The mean absolute differences of PBLHs are, respectively, of 206 [*]m and 106 [*]m before and after the removal of the aloft aerosol layer. The results under cloudy <b>sky</b> <b>conditions</b> show a lower agreement (R= 0. 48) in regard of the comparisons performed under clear <b>sky</b> <b>conditions.</b> Besides, the spatial correlation of PBLHs decreases with the increasing spatial distance between CALIOP footprint and Lille observation platform.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the impact of diffuse light on canopy scale emission of isoprene and monoterpenes measured continuously above a mixed temperate forest, using the disjunct eddy-covariance by mass scanning technique with a proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) instrument. To assess this impact, the relationship between emissions/radiation and emissions/gross primary production (GPP) under clear <b>sky</b> and cloudy <b>conditions</b> were analysed. Under cloudy conditions (high proportion of diffuse radiation), the isoprene and monoterpene fluxes were enhanced compared to clear <b>sky</b> <b>conditions</b> (low proportion of diffuse radiation) at equivalent temperature and above-canopy total radiation. The whole-canopy enzymatic activity of the metabolic isoprene production pathway, however, was suggested to be lower under cloudy conditions than under clear <b>sky</b> <b>conditions</b> at equivalent temperature.

Using the clearness index, also known as atmospheric transmissivity or transmittance, this study evidences that the re-analyses often predict clear <b>sky</b> <b>conditions</b> while actual conditions are cloudy. The opposite is also true though less pronounced: actual clear <b>sky</b> <b>conditions</b> are predicted as cloudy. This overestimation of occurrence of clear <b>sky</b> <b>conditions</b> leads to an overestimation of the irradiation and clearness index by MERRA. The overall overestimation is less pronounced for ERA-Interim because the overestimation observed in clear <b>sky</b> <b>conditions</b> is counter-balanced by underestimation in cloudy conditions. The squared correlation coefficient for clearness index ranges between 0. 38 and 0. 53, showing that a very {{large part of the}} variability in irradiation is not captured by the re-analyses. Within an irradiation homogeneous area, the variability of the bias, root mean square error and correlation coefficient are surprisingly large. MERRA and ERA-Interim should only be used in solar energy with proper understanding of the limitations and uncertainties. In regions where clouds are rare, e. g. North Africa, MERRA or ERA-Interim may be used to provide a gross estimate of monthly or yearly irradiation. Satellite-derived data sets offer less uncertainty and should be preferred...|$|R
