6000|$|Last came {{a little}} feeble {{squeaking}} voice, ("that's Bill" [...] thought Alice,) which said [...] "well, I hardly know--I'm {{all of a}} fluster myself--something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and the next minute up I goes like a rocket!" [...] "And <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> old fellow!" [...] said the other voices.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's right, Mary! {{you are a}} good girl, after all! You'll {{stand by}} your father, {{in spite of all the}} House of Peers! I'm glad to see you hold up your head so bravely. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> fancy being a Viscountess, did you! but it is not a heartbreaking matter either, my girl!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! yes, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> I had forgotten. Here it is," [...] {{and opening}} his robe of fur, {{he showed me}} the hideous little talisman hanging about his neck, then added, [...] "Would you like a copy of it, Macumazahn, to keep as a memory? If so, I will carve one for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{intend to}} turn a bit aside! Well, there's that Mr. Mordaunt, whose {{daughter}} you {{pulled out of the}} lion's paws;--he has a house near King's-Bridge, called Lilacsbush." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You needn't {{accept a}} man if you don't want him," [...] said Miss Annie, [...] "but {{there is no}} need of being cruel to him, {{especially}} when he is laid up. If she didn't intend to come out to you again, she ought not to have made you believe <b>so.</b> <b>You</b> <b>did</b> expect her to come, didn't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind {{who says}} <b>so.</b> <b>You</b> <b>did</b> it, {{and it is}} useless for you to deny it. Here are the two guns you took from the gun rack and {{afterwards}} hid in your beds. And here is the despicable note you, Brown, wrote and mailed to Mr. Lacy," [...] and the colonel held out the communication.|$|E
6000|$|... "So you did, old top, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> I'd quite forgotten. I {{ought to}} have thanked you before. Well, so long. There's an early {{rehearsal}} of 'Ask Dad' to-morrow morning, and I must be toddling. Rummy the thing should be called 'Ask Dad,' when that's just what I'm not going to do. See what I mean, what, what? Well, pip-pip!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But he'll think me <b>so</b> plain. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> at first, <b>you</b> know. But he won't be uncivil {{enough to}} tell me <b>so,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> And Mary is to be married in Easter week? Oh, dear, oh, dear; I shall be so shy among them all." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, {{you said}} all that. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> you juggling, small-souled shuffler! And yet when the happy hopefulness faded {{out of that}} poor girl's face, when you saw her furtively slip beneath her shawl the scroll she had so patiently and {{honestly}} scribbled at--so ashamed of her darling now, so proud of it before--when you saw the gladness go {{out of her eyes}} and the tears come there, when she crept away so humbly who had come so--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Father Tiebout, who lay in {{a canvas}} chair with the {{perspiration}} trickling down his forehead, smiled. [...] "There are many other things beyond our comprehension in this country," [...] he said, with a trace of dryness. [...] "We have our senses and our reason. The negro has them, too, but he has something more--shall {{we call it the}} blind instinct of self-preservation? It is, at least, certain that it is now and then necessary to him. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not come by San Roque or the new outpost?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not {{consider}} this visit from your son as {{by any means}} certain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant, whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better." ...|$|R

6000|$|Olive's clear, {{thoughtful}} {{eyes were}} looking into his. [...] "I believe you love me," [...] she answered slowly. [...] "I believe every word you say. But what I say is also true. I {{will admit that}} I have asked myself if I could love you. There {{was a time when}} I was in great trouble, when I believed that it might be possible for me to marry some one without loving him, but I never thought that about you. You were different. I could not have married you without loving you. I believe you knew that, and <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not ask me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear heart!" [...] said Mrs. Tulliver, in mild surprise, [...] "when did I iver make {{objections}} {{to a man}} because he'd got a mole on his face? I'm sure I'm rether fond o' the moles; for my brother, as is dead an' gone, had a mole on his brow. But I can't remember your iver offering to hire a wagoner with a mole, Mr. Tulliver. There was John Gibbs hadn't a mole on his face no more nor you have, an' I was all for having you hire him; an' <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> hire him, an' if he hadn't died o' th' inflammation, as we paid Dr. Turnbull for attending him, he'd very like ha' been drivin' the wagon now. He might have a mole somewhere out o' sight, but how was I to know that, Mr. Tulliver?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Put the case, Pip, {{that here}} was one pretty little child out of the heap who could be saved; whom the father {{believed}} dead, and dared make no stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this power: [...] "I know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you through it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it should be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be produced. Give the child into my hands, and I will {{do my best to}} bring you off. If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost, your child is still saved." [...] Put the case that this was done, and that the woman was cleared." ...|$|E
60|$|You fair, dainty ladies, {{who would}} never know it was morning if {{somebody}} did not enter to pull up the blind and tell <b>you</b> <b>so!</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> well not to venture out in this magic morning light. <b>You</b> would look <b>so</b> plain--almost ugly, {{by the side of}} these beautiful women.|$|R

6000|$|Isa {{protested that}} she had only popped it in to keep it safe until she could return it. Charley broke out. [...] "As if I did not know better than that! Didn't you make him give you that parasol and promise him your photo? Ay, and give it him in return? You thought he would keep your secret, I suppose, but he tells everything, like a donkey as he is, to Bertie Elwood, and Bertie and I have such fun over him. And now, because you are jealous of poor Metelill, and think Aunt Charlotte may take a fancy to you instead of her, you are {{sticking}} his photo into her book just to do her harm with the aunts. I'm not strait-laced. I wouldn't mind having the photos of {{a hundred and fifty}} young men, only they would be horrid guys and all just alike; but Aunt Charlotte is--is--well--a regular old maid about it, and you knew she would mind it, and <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it on purpose to upset Metelill's chances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will get}} {{yourself}} into serious trouble with these fanciful notions of yours," [...] Mrs. Wingfield said angrily. [...] "You {{know as well}} as I do {{how easy it is to}} get up a cry against anyone as an Abolitionist, and how difficult to disprove the accusation; and just at present, when the passions of every man in the South are inflamed to the utmost, such an accusation will be most serious. In the present instance there does not seem that there is a shadow of excuse for your conduct. You simply heard cries of a slave being flogged. You deliberately leave the road and enter these people's plantation, and interfere without, so far as I can see, the least reason for doing <b>so.</b> <b>You</b> <b>did</b> not inquire what the man's offense was; and he may, for aught you know, have half murdered his master. You simply see a slave being flogged, and you assault his owner. If the Jacksons lay complaints against you, it is quite probable that you may have to leave the State. What on earth can have influenced you to act in such a mad-brained way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will answer}} for your {{thinking}} {{the pattern of}} your bracelet much improved since the new hair has been worked in with the old. How slyly you will run away to your own room, and blush unseen, like the flower in the poem, {{when you look at}} it! You may be rather surprised, perhaps, to see some little gold fastenings introduced as additions; but this, the jeweler told me, was a matter of necessity. Your poor dear sister's hair being the only material of the bracelet, when you sent it up to me to be altered, was very different from the hair of that faultless true-love of yours which you also sent to be worked in with it. It was, in fact, hardly half long enough to plait up properly with poor Susan's, from end to end; so the jeweler had to join it with little gold clasps, as you will see. It is very prettily run in along with the old hair though. No country jeweler could have done it half as nicely, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> well to send it to London after all. I consider myself rather a judge of these things; and I say positively that it is now the prettiest hair bracelet I ever saw.|$|E

'That's what <b>you</b> expect. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know, my proud demoiselle, that my {{son would}} scarce have been rash enough to meddle with such lofty gear, for all his folly, {{if he had not}} had a hint that maidens with royal blood but no royal {{portions}} were not wanted at Court, and might be had for the picking up!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, sir, that is generous!" [...] Then {{he got up}} {{and took}} the old man's hands.
