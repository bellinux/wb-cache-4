30|$|As noted above, {{authentic}} leadership, psychological empowerment, {{and core}} <b>self-evaluations</b> are all antecedents of proactive behavior.

In Hypotheses 3, we infer authentic leadership has {{a positive influence on}} core <b>self-evaluations</b> through psychological empowerment. Furthermore, we suggest psychological empowerment and core <b>self-evaluations</b> might exert a sequential mediating effect between authentic leadership and proactive behavior. That is, authentic leadership can increase employee psychological empowerment, in turn improve his/her core <b>self-evaluations,</b> and finally increase employee willingness to perform more proactively.|$|R
30|$|We applied Baron and Kenny (1986)’s {{strategy}} {{to test the}} mediating effect with multiple regressions.

When core <b>self-evaluations</b> are included in regression analyses, core <b>self-evaluations</b> are significantly and positively related to proactive behavior (Model 3, β[*]=[*] 0.12, p[*]<[*] 0.10), but the significant effect of authentic leadership and proactive behavior become insignificant (Model 3, β[*]=[*] 0.10, n.s).

30|$|With {{regards to}} the {{relationship}} between core <b>self-evaluations</b> and proactive behavior, we argue that core <b>self-evaluations</b> can predict employee proactive behavior in many ways. For one, core <b>self-evaluations</b> describe employees’ level of positive self-regard. High levels of core <b>self-evaluations</b> may alleviate individuals’ concerns about potential risks and obstacles involving proactive behaviors (Judge et al. 1997, 1998), because they have confidence in their knowledge, skills, and abilities to anticipate, plan and control their environment (e.g., Judge et al. 2005), and will exhibit more persistence (Wanberg et al. 2005). For another, people with high level core <b>self-evaluations</b> tend to engage in greater social network-building activity during socialization (Johnson et al. 2010). These strong social networks may help them succeed in proactive behaviors.|$|R

40|$|Given {{that work}} {{engagement}} {{has been shown}} to be related to positive individual and organizational outcomes, researchers have examined factors that predict work engagement. Personal resources and job resources are two factors that previous research has found to predict work engagement. The purpose of this study was to examine core <b>self-evaluations</b> (personal resource) and their interaction with perceived organizational support (job resource) on predicting working engagement. A total of 155 participants in a variety of job industries participated in an online survey. The study examined the direct effect of core <b>self-evaluations</b> in predicting work engagement as well as the interaction between core <b>self-evaluations</b> and perceived organizational support in predicting work engagement. In support of the first hypothesis, core <b>self-evaluations</b> were found to predict work engagement. However, no interaction effects of core <b>self-evaluations</b> and perceived organizational support in predicting work engagement were found. Perceived organizational support was found to strongly and directly predict work engagement above and beyond core <b>self-evaluations.</b> These findings suggest that in order to increase employee engagement, organizations should try to maximize core <b>self-evaluations</b> and perceived organizational support.

40|$|This study aims to {{understand}} change in core <b>self-evaluations</b> by investigating dynamics of CSE and life experiences {{as indicated by}} job satisfaction with a multilevel perspective in terms of within- and between-individual change. Core <b>self-evaluations</b> have been proposed as static personality traits that influence individuals’ life experiences from the dispositional perspective. However, core <b>self-evaluations</b> were derived from and can also be influenced by life experiences from the contextual perspective. Based on the corresponsive principle of personality development, this study incorporated both dispositional and contextual perspectives of personality to examine longitudinal reciprocal relationships between core <b>self-evaluations</b> and job satisfaction with changes operating in within-person and between-person process. Longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey from 1997 to 2006 were used. A total of 5, 827 participants are selected in the database (48. 6 % are males and 51. 4 % are females).
