40|$|Mimbot robot {{consists}} of a mechanical system with one degree of freedom activated by a single motor; this robot is capable of simulating the human gait. Mimbot has three essential mechanisms: the Chebyshev mechanism, the pantograph mechanism and a stabilization system. The studied mechanism is an articulated system of links used in the leg of of the Mimbot biped robot. The technology used in the Mimbot biped is characterized by keeping these design conditions; using a mechanical system based on classical mechanics, the biped must reproduce the trajectory of human gait, energy consumption should be minimal and the prototype should be a low-cost robot. The role of the original stabilization system is to guide the foot to provide support for both legs; however, {{the position of the}} foot is not completely parallel to the support surface, which causes variations in the trajectory of the mass center of the biped, causing loss of stability. This paper presents a study of stability in the sagittal plane of the robot, adding a new mechanism that ensures that the <b>stabilizer</b> <b>link</b> is parallel to the ground at all times. Finally, a study of the kinematic and dynamic behavior generated by the modification has been carried out through an analytical model created by Adams ® software...|$|E
50|$|ASN-209 uses twin-boom pusher layout, rear {{installed}} engine disposition with high-set wings and a <b>stabilizer</b> <b>linking</b> the twin fins. Excellent overall aerodynamic design and EMC design enable {{the system to}} install {{many different kinds of}} airborne equipment, such as Electronic countermeasures (ECM), communication relay and weather detection. With a coverage radius is 200 km and endurance of 10 hours, ASN-209 UAV System can supervise big area and frontier within one sortie. In order to overcome with refueling issue, using two UAVs and switching them out when one reaches its 10-hour limit {{so that they can be}} used for 24 hours consecutively.|$|R
40|$|The flying {{qualities of}} the Martin model 202 {{airplane}} have been estimated chiefly {{from the results of}} tests of an 0. 0875 -scale complete model with power made in the Wright Brothers tunnel at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and from partial span wing and isolated vertical tail tests made in the Georgia Tech Nine-Foot Tunnel. These estimated handling qualities have been compared with existing Army-Navy and CAA requirements for stability and control. The results of the analysis indicate that the Martin model 202 airplane will possess satisfactory handling qualities in all respects except possibly in the following: The amount of elevator control available for landing or maneuvering in the landing condition is either marginal or insufficient when using the adjustable <b>stabilizer</b> <b>linked</b> to the flaps. Moreover, indications are that the longitudinal trim changes will be neither large nor appreciably worse with a fixed stabilizer than with the contemplated arrangement utilizing the adjustable stabilizer in an attempt to reduce the magnitude of the trim changes caused by flap deflection...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} {{a simple and}} effective technique for fabricating a hybrid nanostructure of graphene-silver nanoparticles. The structure was prepared by stacking method with polyvinylpyrrolidone as a <b>stabilizer.</b> The chemical <b>linking</b> of G-PVP-Ag is possible through PVP-based ligand chemistry. The resulting hybrid film exhibited 87 % transparency. The electrical properties under UV light increased compared with only one material. The conversion efficiency of a solar cell fabricated with the hybrid structure also increased approximately by 1. 5 % {{compared with that of}} solar cell fabricated without the hybrid film...|$|R

40|$|Exquisite quantum {{control has}} now been {{achieved}} in small ion traps, in nitrogen-vacancy centers and in superconducting qubit clusters. We can regard such a system as a universal cell with diverse technological uses from communication to large-scale computing, provided that the cell is able to network with others and overcome any noise in the interlinks. Here, we show that loss-tolerant entanglement purification makes quantum computing feasible with the noisy and lossy links that are realistic today: With a modestly complex cell design, and using a surface code protocol with a network noise threshold of 13. 3 %, we find that interlinks that attempt entanglement {{at a rate of}} 2  MHz but suffer 98 % photon loss can result in kilohertz computer clock speeds (i. e., rate of high-fidelity <b>stabilizer</b> measurements). Improved <b>links</b> would dramatically increase the clock speed. Our simulations employ local gates of a fidelity already achieved in ion trap devices...|$|R
40|$|NOVELTY - The circuit to {{evaluate}} complex impedances has a voltage supply with a frequency generator (8) to give digital signals, a 1 : 2 frequency divider (9), and a unit (10) to give two alternating voltage signals with a 90 deg. phase shift {{with the first}} frequency. The phase shift remains during a frequency variation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The frequency generator (8) gives a signal of twice the first frequency and a scanning ratio of 50 %, or four times the first frequency where the voltage supply has a second 1 : 2 frequency divider. The unit (10) to give two alternating voltage signals is a D-flip-flop. The signals from the amplifier and the phase shifted signals are combined to give two output signals to show the real and imaginary parts of the impedance, using a half-wave or full-wave rectifier. A deep pass filter {{is in front of}} the current supply. The links between the sensor and amplifier are shrouded. The amplifier has a buffer amplifier with an amplification factor of V= 1. The outer lead of the shrouding is linked to the buffer amplifier output. The amplifier has connections for positive and negative supply voltages, each with a resistance connection to the supply voltage. A voltage <b>stabilizer</b> is <b>linked</b> to the amplifier output. One or more sensors each have two electrodes to register the complex impedance. A signal converter switches the input of the evaluation circuit between the separate sensors. The electrodes are covered with a thin insulation layer of silicon carbide, in comparison to the gap between the electrodes, which has high chemical stability in a layer thickness of 0. 2 - 2. 0 mu m. The sensor is a surface wave sensor, with capacitative electrodes, and the assembly can register other measured values. The sensor can be fitted with interdigital electrodes on the substrate of the surface wave sensor, where one is the interdigital electrodes of a pair of measurement electrodes. USE - The apparatus is for measurement of fluid characteristics, the aging o f lubricant oil, the moisture content in soil, to measure ion concentrations, to determine the water content in liquids with low dielectric values, to determine the water content in alcohol or oil and vice versa, to register the water content in brake fluid, to measure the composition of milk, the time point of concrete hardening, to measure the contamination of soil by oil or acids, to identify acids and lyes in water and measure their concentration, and the like. ADVANTAGE - The circuit gives a constant phase shift even during temp. changes and frequency alterations without any complex phase smoothing systems...|$|R
