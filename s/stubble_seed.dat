40|$|Leguminous {{cover crops}} are one {{important}} source of nitrogen in organic stockless farming. Therefore the influence of six legume species in pure stands and one grass-clover mixture on grain yield {{and quality of the}} undersown winter rye and of the succeeding crop spring oat was examined. Three field trials were conducted at one experimental site in southern Bavaria (2005 / 06 / 07 until 2007 / 08 / 09; in 2005 / 06 / 07 only three of six leguminous undersowings). Additionally, after the harvest of rye two stubble seeds (clover in pure and mixed stands with vetch and mustard) and a control (rye without cover crop) were established in each year. The cash crop was not affected by the undersown variants with respect to grain yield and quality. However, grain yield of the subsequent oat was generally higher after cover crops compared to the control. Thereby the grain yield after black medick, white or red clover in the undersown variants was significantly higher than after the stubble seeds and after the grass-clover mixture in one and two of three years, respectively. Furthermore the crude protein content of oat was positively affected after all undersown variants in contrast to the variants <b>stubble</b> <b>seed.</b> The cash crop was not affected by the undersown variants with respect to grain yield and quality. However, grain yield of the subsequent oat was generally higher after cover crops compared to the control.

40|$|The {{cropping}} of leguminous {{cover crops}} usually leads to higher yields in subsequent cereals. The economic efficiency of leguminous cover crops was calculated in several field trials. Criterion was the yield (with adjusted costs) from the succeeding crops winter triticale and spring oats, respectively, after different leguminous cover crops undersown or as <b>stubble</b> <b>seed</b> {{in comparison to}} a control plot without cover crop. Thereby, the costs for seeds and the variable machine costs were taken into account. The highest yield was reached for both types of grain following undersown white clover, the second highest following undersown black medic. In contrast, the yield was lower following red clover and grass-clover undersowings as well as different stubble seeds. In parts of these variants, the yield was even lower than in the control without cover crop. ...|$|E
40|$|For stockless {{organic farming}} {{cultivation}} of leguminous cover crops {{is an important}} source for the nitrogen supply of organic cropping systems. However, too strongly developing living mulch systems may affect the undersown cash crop. At two experimental sites in Bavaria {{the impact of the}} sowing date of cover crops on grain yield of the undersown cash crop winter rye and the subsequent crop spring oat was determined in two and three field trials, respectively (2003 / 04 / 05 until 2004 / 05 / 06 and 2002 / 03 / 04 until 2004 / 05 / 06, respectively). Living mulch treatments were white clover and grass-clover (alfalfa, red and white clover, diverse grasses) with seeding in autumn and spring as well as red clover and black medick with seeding only in autumn. Additionally, a control (rye without cover crop) and a legume <b>stubble</b> <b>seed</b> were grown. The impact of cover crops’ sowing date was crucial to cash crop and subsequent crop. Undersowings in autumn (above all grass clover mixture), but not in spring negatively affected the grain yield of the undersown rye. On average 26...|$|E
40|$|Sowing date of fodder legumes {{and type}} of legume may {{influence}} yield and preceding crop effect. Field trials were conducted at two sites in Upper Bavaria in 2010 - 2012. Seven types of clover in pure stands or clover/grass leys were compared for one main production year. Sowing dates were undersowing triticale in spring, <b>stubble</b> <b>seeds</b> after harvest of preceding crop triticale and spring seed in the main production year. Dry matter and crude protein yields were strongly affected by sowing date and by type of clover. Earlier sowings lead to higher yield of fodder legumes.

Mulching of fodder legumes resulted in higher yields and mostly higher baking quality (crude protein content, wet gluten content and baking volume) of the succeeding wheat. Earlier sowings leaded mostly to higher yields and higher baking quality.

40|$|Burning {{bluegrass}} <b>seed</b> <b>stubble</b> is {{an important}} production practice that, among other benefits, increases production and stand life of this perennial crop. Despite economic fore-casts that higher production costs from the 1996 state ban on <b>seed</b> <b>stubble</b> burning would reduce Washington production by up to 30 %, output in the years 1998 – 2005 was nearly two-thirds higher than in any previous eight-year period. This study seeks to explain why that paradoxical behavior occurred. This study puts forward and systematically tests sev-eral hypotheses. The only hypothesis with any support, innovation offsets, is examined by an assessment of contemporaneous innovations and by corroborative statistical evidence. Hicks, in The Theory of Wages, introduced the concept of induced innovation—change in relative factor prices can spur innovation to more efficiently use the factor that has become relatively more expensive. The concept of innovation has since produced an extensive literature about {{a wide range of}} sources of innovation and technological change (Ruttan). Porter and van der Linde identified environmental regulation as a possible causative agent for innovation in arguing that “properly designed environmental standards can trigger innovation that may partially or more than fully offset the costs of complying with them ” (Porter and van der Linde, p. 98). This hypothesis of “innovation offsets ” in response to environmental regulation has been contested as not having strong theoretical foundations and contested on the assumption that inefficiencies in production are so abundant that all environmental regulation will result in cost-offsetting innovation (Palmer, Oates, and Portney). More recently, studies have attempted to provide formal theoretical foundations to the Porter hypothesis (see, for example, Ambec and Barla, or Mohr), test the validity o...|$|R
40|$|Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{production}} in the warm areas of South Asia is severely affected by spot blotch caused by Cochliobolus sativus. There are several inoculum sources suspected to harbor C. sativus during the off season. This {{study was conducted to}} determine survival and potential sources of C. sativus inoculum from rice <b>stubble,</b> wheat <b>seed,</b> soil and weeds in three cropping systems (wheat-rice, wheat-fallow and wheat-green manure) during the 2004 and 2005 wheat growing seasons at Rampur, Nepal. Wheat seed, soil and rice stubble in the field, and weed plants in and around research plots were examined for the presence of the pathogen. Koch’s postulates were applied to verify representative strains. The pathogen was found in the wheat seed at moderate to high levels, but was absent in soil samples and rice stubble collected from the field before wheat was sown after rice. Weeds such as Blumea sp., Dichanthium annulatum, Digitaria ciliaris, Phalaris minor, Saccharum officinarum, Axonopus compressus, Brachiaria mutica, Eleusine coracana, Panicum sp., Paspalum scrobiculatum, Pennisetum purpureum, Setaria italica, Zea mays and Zizania aquatica harbored C. sativus. The C. sativus strains isolated from these weeds infected wheat by producing typical spot blotch symptoms. It is concluded that the weeds prevalent in different cropping sequences and on adjacent uncultivated land can serve as secondary hosts for C. sativus. This study presents important new information that could assist in better understanding spot blotch epidemiology and in developing integrated management strategies for spot blotch of wheat in the warmer growing regions of South Asia...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} explore {{effective}} methods for weed control in paddy fields, we investigated {{the dynamics of}} weed seeds in Nanjing from June to November of 2005. A total of 24 weed species representing 15 families were found before seedling transplanting and at late growth stage of rice, while during irrigation stage, 26 species of 17 families were identified from floating weed seeds. The two stages shared 18 weed species, accounting for 56. 25 % of the total weeds. Most of them belonged to Gramineae, Polygonaceae, Ranunculaceae, Primulaceae, Cyperaceae, Compositae, and Pontederiaceae. There were more weed seeds and more species floating at the edge than {{in the middle of}} the paddy field. Some weed seeds could float longer, such as Beckmannia syzigachne, Lysimachia candida, Ranunculus chinensis, Rumex dentatus, Cnidium monnieri, and Alopecurus aequalis. Many floating weed seeds aggregated around rice <b>stubble.</b> In general, <b>seeds</b> began to sink abruptly after floating for two days, and most of them fell to the bottom after eight days.

40|$|Management {{strategies}} of Septoria leaf blotch {{could be improved}} by a better characterization of the onset and early stages of epidemics. The inoculum build-up and overseasoning potentially involve various fungal structures (ascospores, pycnidiospores, mycelium) and plant material (wheat <b>seeds,</b> <b>stubble</b> and debris; wheat volunteers; other grasses). Among the mechanisms reportedly involved in disease establishment and year-to-year disease transmission, infection by ascospores, wind-dispersed from either distant or local infected wheat debris, is considered as the most significant. Nevertheless, infection by pycnidiospores, splash-dispersed either from neighbouring wheat debris or from senescent basal leaves, has also been inferred from indirect evidence. The contribution of wheat debris to {{the early stages of}} Septoria leaf blotch epidemics and the relative importance of different types of inoculum to the establishment of Mycosphaerella graminicola were assessed in a three-year, field experiment conducted in the Paris Basin, a main wheat producing area in France. Three options of debris management (chopped debris, removed debris followed by tillage, tillage in absence of debris) were tested, which had a strong effect, although transient, on the early epidemic dynamic: the more debris present on the soil surface, the more severe initial disease was. The relative production of pycnidiospores and ascospores was measured on the chopped debris. Autumn conditions, characterized by moderate temperature with alternating wet and dry periods, were favorable for the production of ascospores and pycnidiospores, which concomitantly peaked in October-November; thus both types of spores can be involved as primary inoculum in North-West European conditions. During the winter period, the decrease in primary inoculum delayed disease progress; later on, disease progress resumed because of the input of inoculum from remote origin (ascospores). Management of wheat debris at the plot scale cannot be expected to decrease final disease severity and yield loss, although it can reduce the local amount of primary inoculum. Such a decrease, however, is likely to be obtained by limiting inoculum on a larger scale, considering that local inoculum sources in a given plot will also act as inoculum sources for distant plots...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a demand}} for new {{recommendations}} for pulse seeding rates that will {{meet the needs of}} organic farmers. This study was conducted to determine the impact of seeding rate on N 2 fixation and N accumulation in lentil and pea and to examine the impact of different seeding rates of lentil and pea on the productivity and N-uptake (i. e., N benefit) in a subsequent wheat crop. The study was performed between 2005 and 2007. Two sites were selected each year of the two-year experiment on certified organic farms in central Saskatchewan. At each location, lentil (Lens culinaris L.) cultivar CDC Sovereign and field pea (Pisum sativum L.) cultivar CDC Mozart were each seeded at five different rates. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar AC Elsa was sown as a non-fixing reference crop at a plant population density of 250 seeds m- 2. In the following year, wheat was sown to assess the effect of the pulse seeding rate treatments on the succeeding crop. The pulse crop seeding rates significantly affected the quantity of N 2 fixed of lentil and field pea, although %Ndfa (80 to 88 % and 79 to 85 % for lentil and pea, respectively) typically was unaffected by seeding rate. Yield parameters of following wheat crop were not affected by the seeding rates of the previous pulses. Typically, N contributions increased with increasing seeding rates of both lentil and pea, but there was no detectable difference in N uptake by the following wheat grown on the both pulse <b>stubble.</b> The different <b>seeding</b> rates of organically grown lentil and field pea have impacts on the amount of N 2 fixed and N contribution to the soil.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} initiated in spring 2012 {{was established to}} assess the relationships between grain yield, grain protein and soil properties including elevation, electrical conductivity, pH, and organic carbon in an undulating landscape. Grain protein can reflect the balance of nitrogen (N) relative to other yield limiting factors. The objective {{of this study was}} to 1) assess relationships between soil properties, crop yield and protein content in an undulating landscape in south-central Saskatchewan, and 2) determine feasibility of using protein content along with yield and soil data in identifying variable rate N application zones. In 2012, wheat, canola and peas were seeded. Soil samples and harvest measurements were taken from two transects in each field area. Wheat, canola and pea yields ranged from 882 to 2554, 1143 to 2342, and 839 to 3122 kg ha- 1 respectively, while protein content for wheat, canola and peas ranged from 10. 5 to 14. 4, 14. 2 to 20. 6 and 14. 5 to 17. 7 percent respectively. Protein in wheat was positively correlated with pH in the 30 - 60 cm depth and negatively correlated with electrical conductivity in the 30 - 60 cm depth. Protein in canola was positively correlated with organic carbon in the 0 - 30 cm depth. Wheat yield was positively correlated with organic carbon in the 0 - 30 cm depth. Pea yield was negatively correlated with electrical conductivity in the 0 - 30 and 30 - 60 cm depths.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of AgronomyScott A. StaggenborgSpatial {{variability}} in plant available {{water can be}} caused by uncontrollable factors such as topography and soil texture as well as controllable factors such as residue management. Research located on the High Plains evaluated the impact of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) stubble height on snow catch, plant available water at seeding, and optimal corn seeding rates. Treatments consisted of stripper harvest height of 71 cm (28 in.), cut heights of 25 cm (10 in.), and 10 cm (4 in.) Measured snow depths were significantly different among treatments (p< 0. 0001) with equivalent precipitation of 5. 77 (2. 27), 3. 25 (1. 28), and 1. 73 cm (0. 68 in.) for the stripped, 25 cm, and 10 cm heights respectively. Available soil water at planting increased 24 % as stubble height increased from 10 to 71 cm (4 to 28 in) in one year of the study. Two corn hybrids of varying maturity (97 and 108 days) were planted into the <b>stubble</b> treatments at <b>seeding</b> rates ranging from 2. 47 to 5. 43 plants m[superscript]- 2 (10 to 22 000 plants ac[superscript]- 1). In the dry year, the long season hybrid responded positively to increasing population in tall stubble and negatively in short stubble. Yield of the short season hybrid increased with increasing stubble height and was mostly unresponsive to population. Grain yields of both hybrids responded positively to increasing plant population in a wet year. Treatments also affected the yield components of yield plant[superscript]- 1, kernel weight, and kernels plant[superscript]- 1. Managing seeding rates for uncontrollable factors was attempted with small-plot and field scale research across 3 fields in northeast Kansas. A relationship between soil electro-conductivity (EC) and measured water holding capacity values was developed for one study field. This quadratic relationship was significant (p< 0. 0001) and explained {{variability in}} water holding capacity with respect to EC quite well (R[superscript] 2 = 0. 6239). Responses from small plots showed that sites differing in population response characteristics could be identified.

40|$|Orobanche ramosa L. is an annual, {{parasitic}} weed {{present in}} the western Murray-Mallee region of South Australia. A quarantine zone was established to encompass all known infestations, and has been adjusted over time as new infestations have been discovered. The movement of fodder, machinery, grain and straw, horticultural crops, livestock, and soil is controlled by strict quarantine procedures, to prevent further spread across the landscape. O. ramosa presents a unique situation for weed managers: plants are obligate parasites, relying entirely on broadleaved hosts for their water and nutrition; and seeds are tiny (0. 3 mm), produced in large numbers (up to 100 000 seeds per plant), and are long-lived, persisting in the soil seed bank for up to 13 years. The dispersal vectors for O. ramosa in South Australia {{are the focus of}} this Master’s thesis. Two dispersal vectors were chosen for investigation: sheep and wind. Sheep were examined as possible vector for seeds, both via the gut (internal transport, or endozoochory) and via adhesion on the external surface of the animal (external transport, or epizoochory). Internal transport via sheep was investigated with a classic gut-passage experiment, which showed a peak in excretion of weed seeds at day 2, reducing to zero seeds excreted at day 8, and a half-life of 2 days. Two phases of external transport on sheep was studied: attachment and retention. Attachment was confirmed by finding seeds on the body wool and feet of sheep that had been kept for 7 days on soil with an O. ramosa seedbank. Seed retention was confirmed by placing seeds onto the body and still finding them in wool samples after 7 days. Wind was the other dispersal vector investigated for O. ramosa. A survey of natural wind dispersal was conducted, which confirmed wind as a vector and allowed trap design to be tested. Then a portable field-based wind tunnel was used to investigate the effects of ground cover (bare ground and cereal stubble) and wind speed (low, medium and high) on wind dispersal of O. ramosa <b>seeds.</b> For the <b>stubble</b> treatments, more <b>seeds</b> were trapped within the tunnel, and on bare ground more seeds were trapped exiting the tunnel. Importantly, the data showed that low wind speeds readily move O. ramosa seeds, and that the seeds are capable of aerodynamic lift in the wind profile. Results are discussed in the context of dispersal biology, quarantine procedures, and future work that would further refine knowledge of likely dispersal vectors for O. ramosa. Thesis (M. Sc.)

40|$|Cover crop {{interest}} among Midwestern farmers has greatly {{increased over the}} past few years, with a focus on cover crops that can be successfully integrated into corn-soybean rotations. Oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L.) is receiving attention due to its large fleshy taproot that winter-kills and is excellent at scavenging nitrogen (N) and penetrating deep into the subsoil. Although oilseed radish (OSR) can scavenge large quantities of N in the fall, its rapid decomposition in spring may release N too early for the succeeding cash crop to benefit, thereby allowing N to leach out of the root zone. It was hypothesized that planting OSR in combination with a higher C:N ratio cereal cover crop would tie up N longer in the spring and reduce premature N release. The objectives of this one year study in west-central Indiana were {{to determine the effects of}} OSR and OSR bicultures on soil ammonium (NH 4 -N) and nitrate (NO 3 -N) concentrations with time and distance from the OSR tuber, soil penetration resistance, and succeeding corn crop N uptake and yield compared to the no cover crop control. The cover crop treatments included OSR (var. Groundhog), OSR/oat (Avena sativa L.), OSR/cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), and a control (no cover crop), and were established on silt loam soils in the fall of 2011. The experimental design consisted of a randomized complete block design with four cover crop treatments and three replicates at each of four sites. Cover crop treatments were established into wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) <b>stubble</b> at a <b>seeding</b> rates of 13 (OSR), 7 / 31 (OSR/oat), and 7 / 36 (OSR/rye) kg ha- 1. Cover crops that did not winterkill were chemically terminated in late March-early April 2012. Corn was planted after all cover crop treatments on 4 May 2012. Starter fertilizer (39 to 44 kg N ha - 1) was the only fertilizer applied in order to look at cover crop N cycling and return to the succeeding corn crop under conditions of low N availability. Bulk soil samples were obtained in the fall and detailed sampling with depth and distance from the OSR tuber was performed in the spring, to observe the timing and pathways of N release. Above- and below-ground biomass was sampled in the fall to observe dry matter accumulation and N content. Soil penetration resistance and soil temperature were measured in the spring to determine the effects of the cover crop treatments on soil physical properties. Nitrogen concentration at two growth stages, V 6 and VT, and yield was determined of the succeeding corn crop as affected by cover crop treatment. Cover crop treatment had more of an effect on soil NO 3 -N concentrations than on soil NH 4 -N concentrations. Oilseed radish, OSR/oat, and OSR/rye soil NO 3 -N concentrations were highest at the surface and decreased with depth, while control soil NO 3 -N concentrations increased with depth. Soil NO 3 -N concentrations increased with time at the 0 - 15 cm depth but stayed about the same with time at the lower depths over the March-April sampling period. Soil NO 3 -N concentrations were also higher closer to the OSR tuber than further away from the OSR tuber. Oilseed radish, OSR/oat, and OSR/rye tended to reduce maximum soil temperatures and increase minimum soil temperatures compared to the control. Cover crop treatment*depth had an effect on soil penetration resistance in the upper 20 cm with OSR generally having a higher penetration resistance than the other three treatments. Corn N concentration at V 6 and corn yield was highest in previous OSR plots, with the lowest corn yield in previous OSR/rye plots, possibly due to N release in the OSR plots and N immobilization in the OSR/rye plots. ...|$|R
