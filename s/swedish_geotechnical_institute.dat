40|$|Geotechnical {{design is}} {{important}} to ensure good stability and bearing capacity of the ground. A {{part of this is}} to make good forecasts of future settlements. Nowadays most calculations are made in computer programs, such as Novapoint Geosuite Settlement. Geosuite Settlement includes a variety of calculation models, where some of the models include an addition of creep behaviour. The main purpose of this diploma work is to compare the results from different geotechnical settlement calculation models in Geosuite Settlement. As a reference object, an undrained test bank on clay in Lilla Mellösa outside of the community Upplands Väsby was selected. On this test site, the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Geotechnical</b> <b>Institute</b> (SGI) has performed measurements of long-term settlements since 1947. The result of this diploma work shows that the calculation models containing creep give result more like the measured settlements, than the calculation models that do not include creep. Despite of this, the measured settlement is greater than the settlement in calculation models containing creep. The most remarkable in this work are high excess pore pressures when using models containing creep. These excess pore pressure, in the result of this work, also decreases very slowly in time. One conclusion of this diploma work, based on the obtained results of this study, in comparison with other studies, is to use a calculation model containing creep, if the conditions are similar to those at the test site Lilla Mellösa...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{was part}} of a project at the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Geotechnical</b> <b>Institute</b> aiming at {{investigating}} the geochemistry of heavy metals and arsenic in pyrite ash. The spe-cific aims with this work were to extend the knowledge on solubility control mechanisms of metals in pyrite ash and how the sorption ability of the ash was dependent on content of iron (hydr) oxides. Pyrite ash is a waste product from the roasting process of pyrite ore when producing sulphur dioxide. Sampling was per-formed at the former pulp mill Bergvik sulfit and leaching and selective extraction tests were performed on the material. EDTA-extractable concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn and oxalate extractable con-centrations of Al, Fe and As were used as input in the geochemical equilibrium model Visual MINTEQ together with macro-cations, anions and DOC obtained from the pH leaching test. The predicted solution concentrations of Al, Fe, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn and As from the model were compared to the pH leaching measurements. The model predicted the concentrations of Al, Cd, Zn and Cu very well without any parameterisation. The estimates for Pb and Fe were not as well matched with the experimental data which emphasises the need for further research on filter size and colloidal particles in solution. Too few measurements above detection limit were obtained for As to get a good verification of the model. The mechanism controlling the solution concentration at natural pH (6. 5 – 7. 1) for Al and Cu seemed to be precipitation of a mineral phase and for Cd, Pb, Zn and As complexation to (hydr) oxide surfaces. At alkaline pH the solution concentration of Zn was controlled by precipitation. Overall this approach, with leaching and selective extraction tests together with geochemical modelling, seems to be promising in the risk assessment of contami-nated soils...|$|E
40|$|Mercury (Hg) {{cannot be}} degraded. Therefore only two {{principal}} processes {{are available for}} the treatment of Hg-contaminated soil: (1) the separation of Hg from the soil or (2) the stabilisation of Hg within the soil. Prior to selecting a suitable treatment technique, it is necessary to have an understanding of Hg behaviour in contaminated soil, i. e., distribution in particle size fractions, dissolution at different pH and in the presence of chlorides, and mobilisation using various extractants. The thesis aims to evaluate the potential for applying soil washing to decontaminate the Hg-contaminated soil. The Hg contamination originated from inappropriate waste disposal, chlor-alkali process and harbour activities, and the soil was also polluted by other trace elements, i. e., Zn, Cu and Pb, etc. The soil was fractionated from fine to coarse particles to study the effectiveness of physical separation. A pH-static titration ranging from pH 3 to 11 was performed to assess the mobility of Hg in response to pH changes. The chloride influence on Hg mobilisation was studied using an HCl solution of different concentrations as the leachant. Batch leaching tests were used to evaluate Hg solubility in water, and extraction efficiency by various extractants. The extractants derived from wastes were acidogenic leachates generated from biodegradable wastes, and alkaline leachates produced from fly/bottom ashes. The studied soil consisted of dominant coarse-grained fractions, which is usually suitable for particle size separation. However, dry sieving {{has been shown to be}} insufficient to separate clean from contaminated soil fractions although the Hg concentrations decreased with increasing particle sizes. The reasons are likely to be: (i) the physical attachment of fines to coarse particles; (ii) the strong chemical bond of soil organic matter (OM) and minerals for Hg. Distilled water could barely mobilise the Hg from the soil, most likely due to firm chemical bonding between the soil and Hg. Despite the fact that enhanced Hg dissolution was observed at pH 5 and 11 in this study, soil washing by pH adjustment was insufficient for Hg removal. The introduction of chlorides did not facilitate the Hg mobilisation either. Retention of Hg in the soil by OM seemed to be predominant over Hg mobilisation by chlorides. Chemical extraction by leachates from wastes as well as EDTA solution and NaOH solutions showed that neither alkaline nor acidic leachates could facilitate Hg removal from the soil. Mercury was firmly bound in the soil matrix and no more than 1. 5 % of the total Hg could be removed by any of the tested extractants. Future research should therefore focus on the development of Hg immobilisation techniques.

40|$|Results from {{a series}} of 2 D high {{resolution}} reflection seismic profiles collected at a quick-clay landslide site are presented. This study {{is a part of the}} “Integration of geophysical, hydrogeological and geotechnical methods to aid monitoring landslide in Nordic countries” project, sponsored by the (Geoscientists Without Borders) program of Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG). The study area is located on the shoreline of the Göta River, about 60 km north of Göteborg. The Göta River is the largest river in Sweden which runs from Lake Vänern to Göteborg, it follows the Götaälv Zone, which is an approximately 4 km wide fault zone dipping towards the west. The site is known for its quick-clay formation and landslides. The aim of this study is to image bedrock topography and the overburden layerings above it, within the overburden layers of specific interest are a coarse-grained layer and a quick-clay layer which is responsible for “quick-clay landslides”. The area was recently studied by the <b>Swedish</b> <b>Geotechnical</b> <b>Institutes</b> in a nation-wide project that dealt with investigating areas along the Göta River that are prone to landslides. The study area was investigated by various geotechnical (CPTU, CPTU-R soundings, laboratory measurements) and electrical resistivity investigations. Results from this investigation are used to interpret shallow seismic reflections and better understand the near surface geology. The seismic reflection data presented in this thesis were acquired along two profiles, 484 m and 384 m long (lines 2 and 3), in September 2011. A weight-drop and sledgehammer source was used to generate the seismic signal. A receiver spacing of 4 m and source spacing of 4 - 8 m was used. Power spectras of various sources and raw shots (before and after vertical stack) are also discussed. Processing of high resolution data was challenging in this area where the bedrock is very shallow. Therefore, stacked sections were very sensitive to stacking velocity; a great effort was made to obtain the velocity model. Pre-stack spectral whitening and band pass filtering after stack were the key steps for successful imaging. After carefully processing the data, we were able to image very shallow reflections and bedrock topography. A coarse-grained layer interpreted at 25 - 50 m depth, may be playing an important role in the formation of quick-clay and hence provide the triggering mechanism for landslides. The coarse layer potential to form quick-clays and its role in landslides, however, requires further investigation using other types of hydrogeological data, geotechnical data and geophysical well logging. ...|$|R

3000|$|A tsunami in the fjord Lyngen {{could be}} the result of two factors: an {{underwater}} landslide, or the collapse or rockslide from a flank of Nordnes mountain which sits on the shore of the fjord (Figs.  1 and 2). A large rocky mass sliding into the fjord would be enough to trigger a tsunami, known locally as [...] "flodbølge", and would have a major effect on the village of Lyngseidet, located 7 km away on the opposite bank (Figs.  1 and 2).
