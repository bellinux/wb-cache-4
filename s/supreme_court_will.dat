According to precedent, when hearing an appeal on certiorari from the highest court of a state, the United States <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>will</b> only pass judgment on the constitutionality of a state law if the question was first raised in state court.

However, the matter should have been considered in a context not of marriage, but of registering familial partnership. Furthermore, {{it would have been}} impossible to conclude whether the applicants' rights were violated or not unless their claim is accepted and reviewed in a proper manner.

The king also appointed a new head of the Board of Grievances and Abdulrahman Al Kelya as the first chief justice of the new Supreme Court.

50|$|In Sweden, the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> and the <b>Supreme</b> Administrative <b>Court</b> {{respectively}} {{function as}} the highest courts of the land. The <b>Supreme</b> Administrative <b>Court</b> considers cases concerning disputes between individuals and administrative organs, as well as disputes among administrative organs, while the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> considers all other cases. The judges are appointed by the Government. In most cases, the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Courts</b> <b>will</b> only grant leave to appeal a case (prövningstillstånd) if the case involves setting a precedent {{in the interpretation of}} the law. Exceptions are issues where the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> is the court of first instance. Such cases include an application for a retrial of a criminal case in the light of new evidence, and prosecutions made against an incumbent minister of the Government for severe neglect of duty. If a lower court has to try a case which involves a question where there is no settled interpretation of the law, it can also refer the question to the relevant <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> for an answer.|$|R
500|$|One of {{the primary}} {{functions}} of the Supreme Court of the United States {{is to ensure that}} laws are interpreted uniformly among intermediate courts of appeal. Unless the legislature takes action, the United States Supreme Court is the only source of resolution for conflicts among intermediate courts of appeal. Consequently, the existence of a circuit split may be a key factor when the Supreme Court decides whether to accept a case. Although the Court always maintains discretion over whether it should grant review of a case, the Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States specifically state that the existence of a circuit split is one of the factors the Court considers when deciding whether to grant review. Philip Allen Lacovara and H.W. Perry both claim that the existence of a circuit split is [...] "the single most important generalizable factor" [...] that determines whether the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>will</b> grant review of a case.|$|E

The Communist Party will not be dismayed by this scandalous verdict, which belies our whole national democratic traditions. It will carry the fight to the higher courts, to the broad masses of the people." [...] Vito Marcantonio of the American Labor Party wrote that the verdict was [...] "a sharp and instant challenge to the freedom of every American."

40|$|In {{light of}} the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court’s</b> recent {{narrowing}} of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule in cases like Herring v. United States and Davis v. United States, there is renewed interest in whether state <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> maintain or similarly narrow the search and seizure exclusionary rule for violations of their own state constitutions. The pattern of early adoptions of the exclusionary rule {{as a matter of}} state law before it was mandated by the federal Constitution may provide interesting insights into how the state <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> respond to cases such as Herring and Davis. This article uses social-network theory to evaluate the patterns of communication and influence across state courts in the diffusion of the search and seizure exclusionary rule as a matter of state constitutional law. During the period studied, the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> made the exclusionary rule mandatory in federal criminal prosecutions for violations of the Fourth Amendment, but had not yet ruled that the Fourth Amendment applied to the states. We conceptualize the diffusion of the exclusionary rule in state courts as a matter of state law as a two-stage process. The first stage concerns whether the issue of exclusion of evidence obtained through illegal searches and seizures in violation of state constitutional law was presented to state <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> following adoption of the federal exclusionary rule in Weeks v. United States. The second stage concerns whether the state courts adopted the exclusionary rule as a matter of state law, before Wolf v. Colorado, when the Fourth Amendment was made applicable to the states. This article uses logistic regressions to evaluate the pattern of communication and influence among state courts in the diffusion of the exclusionary rule at each stage in the process. The results are striking. They suggest that precedents by other state <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> in the same West legal reporting regions were more influential in determining whether the question would arise in a particular state than precedents by state <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> in neighboring states, or the same federal circuit regions, or the same census regions. But precedents by other state <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> in the same federal circuit regions appear to have been more influential in determining whether the exclusionary rule would be adopted than precedents in neighboring states, the same West reporting regions, or the same census regions. These results both corroborate and extend those of previous studies...|$|R
2500|$|But {{the late}} Supreme Court Chief Justice, William H. Rehnquist had a {{somewhat}} different view. [...] He {{had this to say}} in his 1998 book All the Laws But One – Civil Liberties in Wartime, p.124: [...] "An entirely separate and important philosophical question is whether occasional presidential excesses and judicial restraint in wartime are desirable or undesirable. In one sense, this question is very largely academic. There is {{no reason to think that}} future wartime presidents will act differently from Lincoln, Wilson, or Roosevelt, or that future Justices of the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>will</b> decide questions differently than their predecessors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other Federal Circuit {{decisions}} {{followed the}} Mallinckrodt approach, which was, {{at the very}} least, divergent from Supreme Court decisions. Accordingly, when certiorari was granted in Quanta, it was widely surmised that the Supreme Court would overturn Mallinckrodt, which many (including the United States Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, viewed as inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent. [...] An [...] commentary advised the law firm's clients: [...] "As set out by the Solicitor General, the Federal Circuit has once again adopted a formalistic rule that does not advance the interest of patent law as articulated by Supreme Court precedent. Indeed, there seems {{little doubt that the}} Solicitor General's views will prevail on the merits, and that the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>will</b> again reverse the Federal Circuit." ...|$|E
2500|$|No {{part of the}} Constitution {{expressly}} authorizes judicial review, but the Framers did {{contemplate the}} idea. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. Precedent has since established that the courts could exercise judicial review over the actions of Congress or the executive branch. Two conflicting federal laws are under [...] "pendent" [...] jurisdiction if one presents a strict constitutional issue. Federal court jurisdiction is rare when a state legislature enacts something as under federal jurisdiction. To establish a federal system of national law, considerable effort goes into developing a spirit of comity between federal government and states. By the doctrine of 'Res judicata', federal courts give [...] "full faith and credit" [...] to State Courts.
