Lanying Lin studied very hard at this primary school and often got the best grade in the class. But she was still required to do all the washing and cooking. As soon as she went back home, she started doing housework. At night, after finishing all her housework, she finally began studying and slept after 12 a.m. every day. And at six in the morning, <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> to cook and then went to school. At the age of six, she could only sleep six hours a day and this continued for her whole life.|$|E
500|$|Strindberg was {{susceptible}} to strong, independent career women, {{as well as}} to dainty, delicate-looking young girls; like his first and second wives—Siri von Essen and Frida Uhl—Bosse combined these qualities. He was entranced when he saw the dark, exotic-looking, petite twenty-two-year-old Bosse (who was often cast in sprite roles or what were conceptualized as [...] "Oriental" [...] roles) play her first major part, an impish Puck in A Midsummer Night's Dream. He immediately picked her out as a suitable actress for the part of The Lady in his coming play To Damascus, and invited [...] her to his bachelor establishment to discuss the role. At this famous first meeting, Strindberg, according to Bosse's narrative of the event, met her at the door all smiles and charm. Offering her wine, flowers, and beautifully arranged fruit, he shared with her his fascination with alchemy, showing her a golden brown mixture he told her was gold he had made. When <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> to leave, Bosse claims Strindberg asked for the feather in her hat to use for writing his plays. [...] Bosse gave it to him, and he used this feather, with a steel nib insert, to write all his dramas during their marriage. [...] It is now in the Strindberg Museum in Stockholm.|$|E

500|$|Gaga {{performed}} [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] at the BRIT Awards on February 16, 2010, at Earls Court Exhibition Centre. The {{performance was}} inspired by the recent death of her friend, fashion designer Alexander McQueen. Initially she had planned a different version of the performance, but changed the concept at the last minute, since she wanted to pay tribute to McQueen. Hence she chose acoustic versions of her songs [...] "Telephone" [...] and [...] "Dance in the Dark". She started the performance by sitting in front of a piano and announcing [...] "This is for Alexander McQueen." [...] The whole performance was low-key compared to her previous ones. The stage was decked out in white, and perched on a pedestal was a statue of Gaga wearing a piano skirt and the lobster-claw heels she wore in her [...] "Bad Romance" [...] music video. After finishing an acoustic performance of [...] "Telephone", <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> from her piano as the disco groove of [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] was heard throughout the room. She wore a lace bodysuit and a large bouffant wig, took to a giant keytar and performed a techno rendition of the track. After the show, she posted a message on her Twitter account: [...] "Tonight's performance is inspired by our friend. Mask by Phillip Treacy, Sculpture by Nick Knight, Music by Lady Gaga. We miss you." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1987, {{during a}} Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert, the other cast members of Neighbours {{put on their}} own talent stage show. Minogue had not {{prepared}} anything so <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> on stage and performed a cover version of [...] "Loco-Motion" [...] - she was then immediately signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records. The song was released as a single in Australia, and became the highest-selling single of the 1980s. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to London with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with Stock, Aitken and Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote [...] "I Should Be So Lucky" [...] while she waited outside the studio. Minogue recorded the song {{in less than an}} hour, and returned home to Australia to work on Neighbours. The song became a huge chart success, and Mike Stock travelled to Melbourne to apologize to Minogue for forgetting about her previous recording session. [...] While Stock was there, Kylie recorded her next single, [...] "Got to Be Certain" [...] along with album track, and the Japan-only single release, [...] "Turn It into Love", and Stock successfully convinced Minogue to return to London in the beginning of 1988 to record songs for her debut album.|$|E

For her researches Benzoni was often seen [...] at the local library Monaco in Saint-Mandé.

Gillette returned alone, and gave varying explanations for what had occurred. Brown's body was found the next day, and Gillette was arrested in the nearby town of Inlet.
