40|$|Development of alumina/glass {{composites}} {{with minimal}} residual porosity and superior mechanical properties requires systematic studies on glass infiltration into porous alumina. This work {{has examined the}} effect of alumina particle size and the resulting pore size distribution on glass infiltration. Samples were prepared by <b>slip-casting</b> <b>a</b> coarser alumina powder and blends of the coarse (d 50 similar to 3. 4 mu m) and a finer (d 50 similar to 0. 7 mu m) alumina powder. After presintering (1200 degrees C) and following a single cycle of infiltration (1100 degrees C), the sample with 50 : 50 (wt%) coarse and fine alumina showed highest flexural strength. Improvement in flexural strength could be imputed to the better glass infiltration...|$|R
