5000|$|The Stadium of Domitian was {{dedicated}} in 86 AD, {{as part of}} an Imperial building programme at the Field of Mars, following the damage or destruction of most of its buildings by fire in 79 AD. It was Rome's first permanent venue for competitive athletics. It was patterned after the Greek model and seated approximately 15,000 - 20,000 [...] - [...] a smaller, more appropriate venue for foot-races than the Circus Maximus. The substructures and support frames were made of brick and concrete [...] - [...] a robust, fire-retardant and relatively cheap material [...] - [...] clad in marble. Stylistically, the Stadium facades would have resembled those of the Colosseum; its floor plan followed the same elongated, U-shape as the Circus Maximus, though on a much smaller scale. Various modern estimates judge the arena length at approximately 200 - 250 metres, the height of its outer perimeter benches at 30 m above ground level and its inner perimeter benches at 4.5 m above the arena floor. This arrangement offered a clear view from most seats. The typically Greek layout gave the Stadium its Latinised Greek name, in agones (the place or site of the competitions). The flattened end was sealed by two vertically <b>staggered</b> <b>entrance</b> galleries and the perimeter was arcaded beneath the seating levels, with travertine pilasters between its cavea (enclosures). The formation of a continuous arena trackway by a raised [...] "spina" [...] or strip has been conjectured.|$|E
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, {{there is}} {{normally}} {{no need for}} red or yellow [...] "arrow" [...] lights, and no provision for them in law. Layouts are typically simple, either a plain three-disc all-directions signal; the same with a green left or right [...] "filter" [...] arrow which lights up either independently of the main green (permitting a left or right turn at an otherwise red light) or along with it (showing that any conflicting traffic has been stopped so turning traffic {{does not need to}} yield); or in multiple full sets where the horizontal positioning and lane layout (particularly where lanes are segregated by kerbs or islands) denotes which directions are stopped or free to move. However, the lack of red and yellow arrows can lead to unusual setups with non standard road layouts, such as a <b>staggered</b> <b>entrance</b> and exit to a busy retail park at one side of a mostly 2-lane (plus turning lane) road. The exit crossing has a normal set of 3-way lights (with the slight oddity that small numbers of vehicles can be momentarily [...] "trapped" [...] inside the junction by the inward-facing red light), as exiting traffic conflicts with both travel directions on the main road. However, the entrance crossing (from the side opposite the complex) only conflicts with oncoming traffic as it is a one-way system, and traffic {{on that side of the}} road conflicts with nothing; indeed at times it is itself mostly exit-traffic. Stopping it at the same time as the entrance flow would cause unnecessary congestion. With multi-colour arrows available, a simple all-turn red/yellow/green set could be installed, and the turning lane slightly kerbed off to make the division plain. In their absence, it is easy to mistake a red disc as an [...] "all stop" [...] signal... so, the straight ahead direction gets a solo permanently lit straight-ahead arrow, bolted onto the side of a red disc, yellow disc, and conflicting-turn green arrow triplet.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} {{begins by}} expanding on ideas {{heard in the}} introduction and transition. The piano plays with <b>staggered</b> hand <b>entrances</b> and joins the clarinet in recalling the second bar of the introduction. The music makes a false movement towards A-flat major, instead landing on E major. The introduction material takes over and winds down to pp. A subito forte evokes the second theme combined with <b>staggered</b> <b>entrances</b> from both piano hands and clarinet. The second theme is finally presented and leads to the recapitulation.|$|R
50|$|One {{style of}} Corsican {{polyphonic}} singing that was particularly associated with Corsican nationalism and the 1970s resurgence of traditional Corsican music was paghjella, which had previously only survived in {{villages in the}} interior of the island. Paghjella traditionally consisted of three voices - known as bassu, secunda, and terza - phrasing polyphonic melodic lines, and typically involved <b>staggered</b> <b>entrances</b> by the three voices and heavy use of the Picardy Third.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{previous}} years, {{this tournament}} does not <b>stagger</b> the <b>entrance</b> of teams {{based on their}} position on the football pyramid; teams from {{as high as the}} Victorian Premier League participated in the opening round, though 16 selected clubs were given byes to the Fourth Round.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{movement}} is in sonata form. It {{begins with a}} solo piano introduction in three parallel octaves, outlining a recurring motif throughout the movement. The clarinet then enters with the slurred first theme. The piano takes over the theme, with the clarinet playing more of an embellishing role. It was normal in clarinet music before the sonatas for the soloist to play mostly, if not always, the melody. Brahms did not reduce {{the scope of the}} piano part to accommodate for the clarinet, but created a more equal and harmonious relationship between soloist and accompanist. [...] The quiet transition between the two themes is in D-flat major and features <b>staggered</b> <b>entrances</b> between the hands of the piano. The second theme introduces dotted rhythms and is marked marcato, contrasting with the first theme. It passes through many key areas quickly before finally resting on C minor.|$|R
5000|$|This {{movement}} {{is characterized by}} rhythms typical of a polonaise, a Polish dance, from which the symphony draws its name. The opening theme is effectively a variety of a rondo theme, and it returns several more times in the movement, with different episodes in between each occurrence: the first is fugal, the second is a wind-choral, {{and the third is}} a section in the relative minor, B minor, where some of the second movement's trio's triplet figures make another reprise. There is then another longer fugal section, a variation of the main theme which modulates into a number of different keys along the way. It is characterized by <b>staggered</b> <b>entrances</b> of the theme, before another variation on another reprise of the main theme slows dramatically into a slower chorale section featuring all the winds and brass. There is then a section with another variation on the original theme up to the original tempo, and then a presto in 1 which drives to the end, which concludes with 12 D major chords over a long timpani roll, and then 3 long Ds, the third of which is a fermata in the very last bar of the symphony.|$|R
60|$|One of Lane's men {{reached the}} {{threshold}} before we did, and {{three or four}} others followed hard upon his heels. The door was wide open, and I sincerely trusted that Sally had made her escape. She had not, however, for the handle of a long brush swung out, and the first ruffian who rushed at the <b>entrance</b> <b>staggered</b> backwards against the comrade behind him. Steel flung him headlong the next moment; the rest yielded passage before the tines of the fork, and we sprang into the house, while our enemy's reinforcements came up at a run. So far we had succeeded better than might have been expected, but our adversaries were growing furious, and the defense of our property no longer appeared the main question. The girl had dropped the brush and grasped a red-ended iron bar.|$|R
