40|$|BackgroundBronchiolitis obliterans, an {{irreversible}} lung disease, {{was first}} associated with inhalation of butter flavorings (diacetyl) in workers at a microwave popcorn company. Excess rates of lung-function abnormalities {{were related to}} cumulative diacetyl exposure. Because information on potential excess mortality would support development of permissible exposure limits for diacetyl, we investigated respiratory-associated mortality during 200022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2011 among current and former workers at this company who had exposure to flavorings and participated in cross-sectional surveys conducted between 200022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2003. MethodsWe ascertained workers' vital status through a Social Security Administration search. Causes of death were abstracted from death certificates.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundSmoking is a {{major risk}} factor for lung {{diseases}} and lower respiratory symptoms, but since not all smokers develop <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> and since <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> is also diagnosed in never-smokers, {{it has been suggested}} that some individuals are more susceptible to develop <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> due to genetics. ObjectiveTo study the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors on the variation in the susceptibility to <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> MethodsIn a population-based questionnaire study of 13, 649 twins, 50 – 71 years of age, from the Danish Twin Registry, we calculated sex-specific concordance rates and heritability of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> The response rate was 75 %. ResultsThe prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> was 9. 3 % among men and 8. 5 % among women. The concordance rate for <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> was higher in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins among women; 0. 30 vs. 0. 17, but not among men; 0. 15 vs. 0. 18.

40|$|The {{hockey stick}} {{regression}} method is a convenient method to estimate safe doses, {{which is a}} kind of regression method using segmented lines. The method seems intuitively to be useful, but needs the assumption of the existence of the positive threshold value. The validity of the assumption is considered to be difficult to be shown. The alternative methods which are not based on the assumption, are given under suitable dose-response curves by introducing a risk level. Here the method using the probit model is compared with the hockey stick regression method. Computational results suggest that the alternative method is preferable. Furthermore similar problems in the case that response is measured as a continuous value are also extended.

To determine the association between <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> and the type of cigarette smoked. Methods. A cross-sectional prevalence study was conducted in an urban area (Pelotas) of Southern Brazil. A total of 1053 subjects aged> 40 years were Interviewed about respiratory symptoms and some risk factors for <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> Results. After adjustment for confounding factors, the number of daily cigarettes smoked was strongly associated with the risk of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> (odds ratio [OR] = 8. 10, 95 % Cl: 4. 48 - 14. 71 for smokers of> 20 cigarettes per day compared to non-smokers).

Four dimensional contingency table analysis by a logistic transform method showed highly significant (p less than 0. 001) additive affects of age (exposure duration), site of work, smoking, and alcohol consumption on development of overall chronic bronchitis (SCB + OCB). Odds ratios were face work:surface work = 1. 78 : 1, smoker:non-smoker = 4. 23 : 1, alcohol greater than 300 g/wk:alcohol less than 300 g/wk = 2. 13 : 1.

40|$|Background: Although <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> is {{associated}} with impaired quality of life, hospitalisations and increased mortality, it has been less in focus after {{the introduction of the}} term chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are no recent published data on the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> from the Scandinavian countries. Aim: The main aim {{of the present study was}} to estimate the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> in West Sweden by using data from a large-scale epidemiological study of the general population. A further aim was to identify current risk factors for <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> in a population with a major decrease in the proportion of smokers. Methods: From the 18, 087 questionnaire responders out of 30, 000 invited to participate at the West Sweden Asthma Study, 2, 000 subjects were randomly selected and invited to detailed clinical examinations performed during 2009 – 2013. A total of 1, 172 subjects aged 17 – 79 participated in the examinations which included, among others, spirometry and structured interviews. <b>Chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> was defined according to reported symptoms. Results: The overall prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> was 7. 2 % (men 7. 6 %; women 6. 8 % ns), and it was 8. 7 % in subjects older than age 60. <b>Chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> was strongly associated with smoking, defined both as current smoking status and pack-years. Other risk factors were increasing age, low socio-economic class and urban living. Of those with <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> 22 % fulfilled the GOLD criteria of COPD.

40|$|Background: Some {{patients}} with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} may share the clinical characteristics of those with asthma; their disease is sometimes called ''asthmatic bronchitis. '' Whether {{there is a difference between}} asthmatics who do and do not develop <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> is not yet clear. We investigated whether asthma and <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> may share some ''allergic'' phenotypes and whether asthmatic individuals who develop <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> subsequently have steeper declines in lung function. Methods: Known risk factors for decline in lung function were analyzed in a representative community population of adults followed up longitudinally since 1972 in Tucson, Ariz, in groups with persistent, newly developed, and past diagnoses of asthma and <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> We evaluated contributions of initial level of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), reversibility with isoproterenol hydrochloride nebulized aerosol bronchodilator treatment, percentage of blood eosinophils to determine eosinophilia, and IgE level. Results: The concurrence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> and asthma is associated with a steeper decline in FEV(1) than is asthma as the sole diagnosis. Asthmatics (those with persistent asthma with and without <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis)</b> had the greatest prevalence of increased reversibility with isoproterenol therapy and with eosinophilia. The prevalence of eosinophilia was also high in those with newly diagnosed <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> without asthma; however, this was not the case in those with persistent <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> without asthma. Larger bronchodilator responses were related to steeper declines in FEV(1) both in persistent asthma and in <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> Conclusions: Bronchodilator response and eosinophilia are generally believed to be hallmarks of asthma.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionThe {{present study}} {{examines}} how the {{trends in the}} prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> {{during the last three}} decades associate with changes in smoking habits during the same period. MethodsAltogether 47 896 subjects aged 25 – 74 years were examined in six independent cross-sectional population surveys repeated every five years between 1982 and 2007 in Finland. The presence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> smoking habits and other risk factors were measured by standard questionnaires. ResultsDuring the study, the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> was significantly higher in men than in women. In men aged 25 – 64 years, the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> decreased from 19 % in 1982 to 13 % in 2007 (p for trend < 0. 001). The corresponding decrease in women aged 25 – 64 years was from 13 % to 11 % (p for trend 0. 009). In men aged 65 – 74 years, the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> decreased from 24 % to 19 % (p for trend 0. 032). Simultaneously, male smoking decreased and smoking in middle-aged women increased. However, adjusting for the changes in smoking habits did not change the declining trends in the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> The significant declining trend in <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> was seen separately in male current smokers and in male and female never smokers aged 45 – 74 years and the declining trend was the greatest in male current smokers.

Twenty three of the patients had non-obstructive <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> and 19 had <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> and <b>chronic</b> obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Eighteen of the patients with bronchitis had recurrent infective exacerbations and 24 did not. Intrabronchial bacterial cultures were taken with a protected specimen brush.

40|$|The high {{mortality}} from <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> in England and Wales and {{the excess}} of urban over rural mortality are unexplained. On dividing England and Wales into 212 local authority areas a strong geographical relation {{was found between}} death rates from <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> and emphysema in 1959 - 78 and infant mortality from bronchitis and pneumonia during 1921 - 5. It was concluded that this relation provided strong evidence of a direct casual link between acute lower respiratory infection in early childhood and <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> in adult life. Regression analysis suggested that infection in early childhood had a greater influence than cigarette smoking in determining the geographical distribution of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> National time trends reflected the influence of both factors. Chronic air pollution in adult life may be less important a cause of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> than previously supposed...|$|R
40|$|A {{house to}} house survey of {{everyone}} aged 20 years and above living in a rural community in the Hill Region of Nepal, situated about 16 km outside Kathmandu city, was conducted to determine the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> and cor pulmonale. Of the total eligible population, 2826 (95. 5 %) were interviewed. <b>Chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> was diagnosed according to the British Medical Research Council criteria, and emphysema and cor pulmonale according to the World Health Organisation expert committee criteria. The crude prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> {{was found to be}} 18. 3 %. The prevalence rate of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> was similar in men and women, whereas {{in most parts of the}} world much lower rates have been recorded in women. Study of a random sample of 85 individuals with <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> showed that 57. 4 % had evidence of airways obstruction, whereas 15. 8 % of a representative sample (n = 111) of the surveyed population (excluding those with <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis)</b> showed evidence of airway obstruction. Of 516 subjects diagnosed as having <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> 382 were subsequently investigated in hospital, 134 having declined further investigation. The diagnosis was confirmed in most of the patients (93. 2 %) who were investigated. Other diseases played an insignificant part in the production of the observed high prevalence rates of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> Of the 382 patients studied in hospital, 87 had emphysema and 42 had cor pulmonale, yielding overall prevalence rates for these two conditions of at least 3. 1 % and at least 1. 5 % respectively...|$|R

SETTING, SUBJECTS: All Icelandic males born in the years 1913 and 1943 who were alive on 1 November 1993. Altogether 1175 (69. 7 %) responded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical symptoms of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> stress symptoms, symptoms of dyspnea and sleep disturbances. RESULTS: 7. 1 % of those 50 years old and 16. 7 % of those 80 years old {{and a history of}} daily sputum expectoration for at least 3 months during the preceding 2 years. These individuals with <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> had a higher prevalence of other respiratory symptoms than did the others, such as "wheezing or whistling" (59. 6 % vs. 7. 2 %), and "awakened by breathlessness" (35. 2 % vs. 6. 0 %). Complaints of dyspnea were more common among those with symptoms of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> e. g. "dyspnea when walking" (19. 4 % vs. 1. 4 %) and "stops walking because of dyspnea" (22 % vs. 1. 6 %). They also complained more often of insomnia and daytime sleepiness and found themselves more stressed than those without <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> These symptoms were all more common among the 80 -year-old men. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> is a frequent illness among Icelandic males. Men with <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> often have decreased quality of life, difficulties in moving and frequently sleep complaints...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that atopy increases the occurrence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> Relations between atopy, smoking, and <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> were studied in farmers. The data were from two successive postal surveys and a skin prick tested subsample. The cross-sectional study consisted of 9017 farmers. Those 6899 farmers who did not have <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> at the beginning and who continued farming were followed for three years. A sample of 150 farmers was skin-tested with 36 allergens. The prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> (rate per 1000), standardised for age and sex, was 41 in non-atopic non-smokers, 101 in atopic non-smokers, 106 in non-atopic smokers, and 257 in atopic smokers (effect of atopy: p less than 0. 001; effect of smoking: p less than 0. 001). The standardised incidence rates of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> (per 1000 farming years) were 14, 34, 36, and 50, respectively (atopy: p less than 0. 001; smoking p less than 0. 001). The relative risk of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> calculated from the incidence data adjusting for the effects of age, sex, smoking or atopy by logistic regression analysis was 2. 2 for atopy (95 % confidence interval 1. 8 - 2. 7) and 2. 3 for smoking (1. 8 - 2. 9). Only 20 farmers had <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> in the skin-tested subjects; the results were consistent with the findings in the surveys but did not reach statistical significance for atopy. In conclusion, atopy and smoking have independent and additive effects on the occurrence of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> at least in dusty farming work...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Smoking is {{a primary}} risk factor for <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> em-physema, and <b>chronic</b> obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease, but since not all smokers develop disease, {{it has been suggested}} that some indi-viduals may be more susceptible to exogenous factors, such as smok-ing, and that this susceptibility could be genetically determined. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to assess, in a popula-tion-based sample of twins, the following: (1) to what extent genetic factors contribute to the development of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> includ-ing emphysema, taking sex into consideration, and (2) whether the genetic influences on <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> including emphysema, are separate from those for smoking behavior. Methods: Disease cases and smoking habits were identified in 44, 919 twins older than 40 years from the Swedish Twin Registry. Disease was defined as self-reported <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> or emphysema, or recurrent cough with phlegm. Individuals who had smoked 10 pack-years or more were defined as smokers. Univariate and bivariate structural equation models were used to estimate the heritability specific for <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> and that in common with smoking. Measurements and Main Results: The heritability estimate for <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> was a moderate 40 % and only 14 % of the genetic influ-ences were shared with smoking. Conclusions: Genetic factors independent of those related to smok-ing habits play a role in the development of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> predicts a more rapid decline of {{forced expiratory volume}} in one second (FEV(1)) in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The hallmark of COPD is airway inflammation. It was hypothesised that COPD patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> are characterised by a distinct inflammatory cell profile, as measured in bronchial biopsies and sputum. From 114 COPD patients (male/female ratio 99 / 15, mean+/-sd age 62 +/- 8 yrs, current smoking 63 %, post-bronchodilator FEV(1) 63 +/- 9 % predicted, no steroids), with and without <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> inflammatory cell counts in bronchial biopsies and induced sputum were measured. Analysis was carried out by logistic regression. COPD patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> had lower eosinophil counts in biopsies and higher percentages of sputum eosinophils than patients without those symptoms, which remained after adjustment for smoking and sex. Patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> also showed higher percentages of macrophages and lower percentages of neutrophils in sputum, which could be explained by differences in smoking and sex. It was concluded that <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> reflects an inflammatory sub-phenotype among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The present results indicate a preferential distribution of eosinophils towards the airway lumen in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> This may have implications for anti-inflammatory treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with chronic bronchiti...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT An {{earlier study}} of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> {{in a rural}} {{community}} of the Hill Region of Nepal using Medical Research Council criteria showed a high prevalence rate that {{was more or less}} equal in the two sexes. Most {{of the women in the}} study population are exposed to domestic smoke caused by wood and straw fires used for cooking and heating purposes in the ill ventilated houses without chimneys. Data from 1375 individuals were analysed to determine whether there was any relationship between domestic smoke pollution and <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> Exposure to domestic smoke was assessed according to the average time per day spent near the fireplace. The association between <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> and cigarette smoking was confirmed. In female non-smokers and smokers and past smokers of both sexes crude and age adjusted prevalence rates for <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> were significantly associated with increasing exposure to domestic smoke. In the living conditions existing in the rural Hill Region of Nepal domestic smoke pollution is an important contributing factor in the development of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> A study of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> in a rural community of the Hill Region of Nepal (pp 331 - 6) using Medical Research Council criteria showed a ver...|$|R
40|$|Vasoactive {{intestinal}} peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide {{involved in}} the regulation of airway mucus secretion. The biological functions of VIP are mediated through two receptors, the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor type 1 (VPAC 1 R) and type 2 (VPAC 2 R). The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify the expression of both VPAC 1 R and VPAC 2 R in the central airways of smokers with <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> Surgical specimens were obtained from 33 smokers undergoing thoracotomy for localised pulmonary lesions: 23 smokers with symptoms of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> and 10 asymptomatic smokers with normal lung function. By using immunohistochemical and microscopic analysis, an increased expression of VPAC 1 R, but not VPAC 2 R, was found in bronchial epithelium, bronchial glands and vessels of smokers with symptoms of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> compared with asymptomatic smokers. Smokers with symptoms of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> also had an increased number of mononuclear cells positive for both VPAC 1 R and VPAC 2 R in the bronchial submucosa. In conclusion, the expression of type 1 and type 2 vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors is increased in the central airways of smokers with <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> suggesting their possible involvement in the pathogenesis of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis...</b>|$|R
