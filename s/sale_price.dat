5|$|The <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> was {{estimated}} at over $600million. Unlike the pre-Gillett era, the team is now privately owned by the Molson family and not by the Molson brewery, which is now a division of Molson Coors. The reputed <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> reflected a return to profitability, due both to a new collective bargaining agreement after the 2004–05 lockout that fixed player costs to revenues and to {{a rise in the}} value of the Canadian dollar back to at or near parity with the U.S. dollar.|$|E
5|$|A {{deal for}} the sale of Constitution Center was agreed to in December 2012. MetLife and an {{unidentified}} investor (represented by Clarion Partners LLC) each purchased a 50 percent interest in the building. The <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> was $734 million, or $524 per square foot (0.093 square meters). The <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> was the most expensive in D.C. history for a single building. (It was not the most paid per square foot, however. That record went to two-building Market Square at 701 and 801 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, which sold in 2011 to Wells Real Estate Investment Trust for $905 per square foot.) When the deal closed in February 2013, David Nassif Associates announces it would wind down its operations and liquidate its remaining obligations.|$|E
5|$|After {{almost two}} years, Ascent sold the Avalanche and Nuggets to Wal-Mart heirs Bill and Nancy Laurie for $400million. However, {{a group of}} Ascent {{shareholders}} sued, claiming that the <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> was several million dollars too low. Ascent then agreed to sell the Avalanche and Nuggets to Denver banking tycoon Donald Sturm for $461million.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sales</b> <b>Price</b> Variance: The <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> {{variance}} {{reveals the}} difference in total revenue caused by charging a different selling price from the planned or standard <b>price.</b> The <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> variance is calculated as: Actual quantity sold * (actual selling price - planned selling price). In the example, the <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> variance was 6*($2-$3)= -$6 (U)nfavourable or minus $6, since the <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> was less than planned.|$|R

5|$|Harrison became {{chairman}} of the Committee on Public Lands and successfully promoted passage of the Land Act of 1800, which {{made it easier to}} buy land in the Northwest Territory in smaller tracts at a low cost. The <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> for public lands was set at $2 per acre. This became an important contributor to rapid population growth of the Northwest Territory.|$|E
5|$|After Gilchriese {{closed his}} museum, the {{painting}} and other contents of the museum were sold at auction by John's Western Gallery of San Francisco. The estimated auction price for the painting had been $200,000 to $300,000; the final <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> on June 25, 2004 was $40,250. It was put up for auction again on June 14, 2014 with an estimated selling price of $40,000–$60,000 but failed to sell.|$|E

5|$|The {{price of}} {{collectible}} cars collapsed {{as a result}} of the recession over the six-year period from 1989–94; for example, a highly collectible Ferrari 250 GTO sold for just $3.5 million in 1994, an $11.1 million loss from its <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> in 1989. The Jaguar XJ220 had attracted a significant number of speculators who hoped the scarcity of the XJ220 and enthusiasm for the Jaguar marque would push up prices overnight, allowing large profits to be made over a short period of time.|$|E
5|$|A 2005 {{survey found}} that 68% of American flex-fuel car owners were not aware they owned an E85 flex. This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} look exactly the same; there is no <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle. Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the opening of}} the American branch, various trade arrangements were made with other film companies, including American Mutoscope and Biograph, the Warwick Trading Company, the Charles Urban Trading Co., Robert W. Paul's studio, and Gaumont. In these negotiations, a print <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> of 0.15 per foot was standardized across the American market, which proved useful to Méliès. However, later price standardizations by the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908 hastened Méliès's financial ruin, as his films were impractically expensive under the new standards. In addition, in the years following 1908 his films suffered from the fashions of the time, as the fanciful magic films he made were no longer in vogue.|$|E

5|$|Two {{units on}} the 87th and 88th floors sold for prices {{in excess of}} $5million in 2009 {{directly}} from the developer. After a few soft years {{in the real estate}} market, it took until August 2014, for units to sell for prices in excess of $1000 per square foot. Two units sold for over $3million that month including a $3.99million sale, which was the highest <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> in the building since 2009. The penthouse sold for $17million in late 2014 to Sanjay Shah, the founder and CEO of Vistex.|$|E
5|$|In April , Sid Sheinberg, a {{seasoned}} lawyer {{and president of}} MCA and Universal City Studios, learned of the game's success and suspected {{it might be a}} trademark infringement of Universal's own King Kong. On April 27, 1982, he met with Arnold Greenberg of Coleco and threatened to sue over Coleco's home version of Donkey Kong. Coleco agreed on May 3, 1982 to pay royalties to Universal of 3% of their Donkey Kongs net <b>sale</b> <b>price,</b> worth about $4.6 million. Meanwhile, Sheinberg revoked Tiger's license to make its King Kong game, but O. R. Rissman refused to acknowledge Universal's claim to the trademark. When Universal threatened Nintendo, Howard Lincoln and Nintendo refused to cave. In preparation for the court battle ahead, Universal agreed to allow Tiger to continue producing its King Kong game as long as they distinguished it from Donkey Kong.|$|E
5|$|Sheinberg {{also learned}} of a {{licensing}} agreement between Nintendo and Coleco, {{a producer of}} home video game consoles. Sheinberg scheduled a meeting with Coleco president Arnold Greenberg on April 27, 1982, ostensibly to discuss possible investment in Coleco. Instead, Universal admonished Greenberg for copyright infringement and threatened to sue if the ColecoVision shipped with Donkey Kong as planned. The next day, Universal telexed Coleco and Nintendo giving them 48 hours to cease marketing Donkey Kong, to dispose of all Donkey Kong inventory, and to hand over all records of profits made from the game. On May 5, Greenberg agreed to pay Universal royalties of 3% of Donkey Kongs net <b>sale</b> <b>price,</b> amounting to six million units and worth about $4.6 million. A week later, he signed an agreement that stated that Universal would not sue Coleco as long as Coleco paid royalties.|$|E

50|$|Some {{retailers}} use markups {{because it}} is easier to calculate a <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> from a cost using markups. If your markup is 40%, then your <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> will be 40% above the item cost. If your margin is 40%, your <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> will not be equal to 40% over cost (in fact, it will be approximately 67% above the item cost).|$|R

5|$|The {{competition}} from the Terrapins caused Dunn to sustain large losses. Although by late June the Orioles were in first place, having won over two-thirds of their games, the paid attendance dropped as low as 150. Dunn explored a possible move by the Orioles to Richmond, Virginia, {{as well as the}} sale of a minority interest in the club. These possibilities fell through, leaving Dunn with little choice other than to sell his best players to major league teams to raise money. He offered Ruth to the reigning World Series champions, Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, but Mack had his own financial problems. The Cincinnati Reds and New York Giants expressed interest in Ruth, but Dunn sold his contract, along with those of pitchers Ernie Shore and Ben Egan, to the Boston Red Sox of the American League (AL) on July 4. The <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> was announced as $25,000 but other reports lower the amount to half that, or possibly $8,500 plus the cancellation of a $3,000 loan. Ruth remained with the Orioles for several days while the Red Sox completed a road trip, and reported to the team in Boston on July 11.|$|E
25|$|The gain or loss is {{calculated}} as the <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> less the purchase price. From the <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> can be deducted {{the cost of}} acquisition of the asset, including incidental costs such as conveyancing costs, {{the cost of the}} disposal, and costs of improving the asset.|$|E
25|$|In {{perfectly}} competitive markets, firms {{decide the}} quantity {{to be produced}} based on marginal costs and <b>sale</b> <b>price.</b> If the <b>sale</b> <b>price</b> {{is higher than the}} marginal cost, then they supply the unit and sell it. If the marginal cost is higher than the price, it would not be profitable to produce it. So the production will be carried out until the marginal cost is equal to the <b>sale</b> <b>price.</b> In other words, firms refuse to sell if the marginal cost is greater than the market price.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{forecast}} demand for existing single-family {{housing in the}} United States. We first find that sales volume (sales) and median <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> (price) have unit roots. We then find that <b>sales</b> and <b>price</b> are cointegrated. We develop a vector autoregressive (VAR) model with error correction to further examine the causality between <b>sales</b> and <b>price.</b> We find that there exists a bidirectional causality relationship between <b>sales</b> and <b>price.</b> <b>Price</b> affects <b>sales</b> significantly and <b>sales</b> affects <b>price</b> weakly. With the VAR model we then forecast <b>sales</b> and <b>price</b> for existing single-family housing during the period 1991 to 1994 by using a recursive method. We find that our predictions for <b>sales</b> and <b>price</b> fit the actual data well...|$|R
