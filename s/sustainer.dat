5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (<b>sustainer)</b> lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The <b>sustainer</b> was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Binge {{drinking}} occurs frequently {{among young}} adults, posing risks {{to health and}} safety. Little is known, however, about which drinkers continue to binge later into adulthood. We sought to identify predictors of sustained binge drinking behaviors in young adulthood. METHODS: Participants from the Nicotine Dependence in Teens (NDIT) cohort (n = 609, 53 % female) completed self-report questionnaires in 20 survey cycles (SCs) during secondary school between 1999 and 2005, and in 2 postsecondary school SCs in 2007 to 2008 (SC 21; Mage = 20 years) and 2011 to 2012 (SC 22; Mage = 24 years). Participants reporting past-year binge drinking in both SCs 21 and 22 were categorized as <b>sustainers</b> (n = 517). Using multivariable logistic regression, we investigated 25 potential predictors of sustained binge drinking, binge-drinking frequency, and change in frequency over time among <b>sustainers.</b> RESULTS: Compared with stoppers, <b>sustainers</b> (85 % of participants) {{were more likely to}} be younger, male, and to have no college/university education. <b>Sustainers</b> began drinking alcohol and binge drinking earlier, drank at least monthly during more secondary school grades, binged more frequently at age 20, and scored higher on impulsivity and novelty seeking in adolescence. Among <b>sustainers,</b> frequent binge drinkers {{were more likely to be}} male, to be nonstudents, to score higher on novelty seeking, and to have reported more depressive symptoms in adolescence. <b>Sustainers</b> who decelerated their binge frequency between SCs 21 and 22 were more likely to be female, to have achieved a higher level of education, and to report more depressive symptoms in SC 21. CONCLUSIONS: The determinants of sustained binge drinking are similar to predictors of binge drinking reported in the literature. Early identification of, and intervention with, youth who are impulsive, inclined toward novelty seeking, and who report higher levels of early sub clinical depressive symptoms might forestall their involvement in risky alcohol use...|$|R

5|$|Schirra {{was awakened}} at 1:40 am ET {{on the morning}} of October 3, and after a hearty breakfast—including a {{bluefish}} he had speared the day before—and a brief physical he left for the launchpad at around 4 am. He entered the spacecraft at 4:41 am ET, where he found a steak sandwich left for him in the 'glove compartment', and began the pre-launch checks. The launch countdown proceeded as planned until 6:15, when there was a 15-minute hold to allow the Canary Islands tracking station to repair a radar set. The countdown resumed at 6:30 and proceeded to booster ignition with no further delays. Liftoff proceeded smoothly, but there was a momentary clockwise roll transient at liftoff, which reached 7.83° per second and approached 80% of the required threshold to trigger the ASIS abort system. This was later identified as being due to a slight misalignment of the main engines and was kept under control by the booster's vernier thrusters. <b>Sustainer</b> engine thrust during the launch was slightly below normal and fuel consumption higher than normal due to a suspected leak in the <b>sustainer</b> fuel system.|$|E
5|$|The capsule {{built for}} the mission, Mercury Spacecraft No. 16, had been {{delivered}} to Cape Canaveral on January 16, 1962. The Atlas LV-3B booster assigned to the mission, No. 113-D, was accepted by NASA at the Convair plant on July 27 and delivered on August 8. In late July, the launch date was set for September 18, but delays with the Atlas booster's delivery {{and a series of}} technical concerns with the safety of the rocket motors caused it to be pushed back several weeks. Some of this {{had to do with the}} modified propulsion system, but also concern over Atlas ICBM tests earlier in the year. There had been no Atlas failures caused by the turbopumps for almost three years, but in late 1961-early 1962, two static firing tests experienced pump failure and explosion of the engine, followed by an Atlas missile in April 1962 that exploded almost immediately at liftoff due to a failure of the <b>sustainer</b> turbopump. Analysis of these incidents failed to locate any specific cause for the pump explosions, but all of them occurred when running untested hardware modifications and during movement of the <b>sustainer</b> inlet valve to the flight-ready open position. It was thus decided to give MA-8's booster a thorough checkout before it could be deemed flight-worthy. On September 6, the tests were scheduled to continue until September 24, which allowed for a probable launch on October 3. A static firing test on the pad would expose the <b>sustainer</b> turbopump to the failure mode in question. This was carried out on September 8 and the booster reported as ready for assembly on September 18.|$|E

40|$|In {{the study}} {{reported}} here, the main question we investigated was whether attention style could be a conditional adaptation. We organized participants of the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS; N = 2, 230) into shifters, <b>sustainers,</b> and two comparison groups, depending on their performance on a shifting- and a sustained-attention task at age 11 years. Compared with <b>sustainers,</b> shifters reported more pre- and perinatal risk factors and more childhood stress, and they adopted a faster life-history strategy. These differences were not found between the comparison groups, who performed well or poorly on both tasks, which suggests that specialization for either sustained or shifting attention {{is the key to}} conditional adaptation. In a subsample (n = 860), we found that stress did not increase depression risk in shifters, whereas a mismatch between early and recent stress predicted depression in <b>sustainers.</b> Cumulative stress predicted depression in the comparison group. These results suggest that shifters retain high levels of plasticity throughout life, whereas sustainers' adapted their phenotype early in life to the expected mature environment...|$|R

5|$|As {{the debate}} over Zeus raged, the Nike team was making rapid {{progress}} developing the actual system. Test firings of the original A models of the missile began in 1959 at White Sands Missile Range. The first attempt on 26 August 1959 was of a live booster stage and dummy <b>sustainer,</b> but the booster broke up shortly before booster/sustainer separation. A similar test on 14 October was a success, followed by the first two-stage attempt on 16 December. The first complete test of both stages with active guidance and thrust vectoring was successfully carried out on 3 February 1960. Data collected from these tests led to changes to the design to improve speed during the ascent. The first test of the Zeus B took place in May 1961. A number of Zeus missiles broke up during early test flights due to excessive heating of the control surfaces, and numerous changes were worked into the system to address this.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike {{the earlier}} SS.10 which steered {{similarly}} to an airplane with small flight controls called [...] "spoilers", {{located on the}} missiles wings, the SS.11 is steered in flight by unique system developed by NORD for France's first air-to-air missile, the AA.20, called TVC (thrust vectoring control) where four small vanes are located around the <b>sustainer's</b> exhaust which under command momentarily push into the <b>sustainer's</b> thrust causing the missile {{to move in the}} direction commanded. Since the missile spins slowly in flight by having the four swept wings slightly offset, a gyroscope is needed to determine the missile's relative orientation to the ground, that is, up, down and right, left. Unlike the earlier spoiler flight control, TVC is a far more precise method of controlling a missile in flight. TVC has been copied by other missile designs including the Russians with their AT-3 Sagger and the Euromissile HOT and MILAN developed by joint venture of the French and Germans.|$|R
25|$|On an orbital mission, the Atlas' rocket engines were ignited {{four seconds}} before lift-off. The launch vehicle {{was held to}} the ground by clamps and then {{released}} when sufficient thrust was built up at lift-off (A). After 30 seconds of flight, the point of maximum dynamic pressure against the vehicle was reached, at which the astronaut felt heavy vibrations. After 2 minutes and 10 seconds, the two outboard booster engines shut down and were released with the aft skirt, leaving the center <b>sustainer</b> engine running (B). At this point, the launch escape system was no longer needed, and was separated from the spacecraft by its jettison rocket (C). The space vehicle moved gradually to a horizontal attitude until, {{at an altitude of}} , the <b>sustainer</b> engine shut down and the spacecraft was inserted into orbit (D). This happened after 5 minutes and 10 seconds in a direction pointing east, whereby the spacecraft would gain speed from the rotation of the Earth. Here the spacecraft fired the three posigrade rockets for a second to separate it from the launch vehicle. Just before orbital insertion and <b>sustainer</b> engine cutoff, g-loads peaked at 8 g (6 g for a suborbital flight). In orbit, the spacecraft automatically turned 180°, pointed the retropackage forward and its nose 14.5° downward and kept this attitude {{for the rest of the}} orbital phase of the mission, as it was necessary for communication with the ground.|$|E
