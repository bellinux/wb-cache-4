5000|$|For {{business}} and word processing use, IBM announced its Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) {{at the same}} time as CGA. MDA was much more popular than CGA at first; it produced a higher resolution text display in 80&times;25 mode, rendering each character in a box of 9&times;14 pixels, of which 7&times;11 were the character itself. This produced sharper and more clearly <b>separated</b> <b>characters</b> than the CGA's 8&times;8 dots text character matrix allowed. Because of this, MDA was the preferred choice for business use. Also, IBM initially manufactured the MDA card as a printer port/MDA combo card. This meant that users wishing to connect printers to their original IBM PC would have to pay for the MDA card anyway (initially $335), while the CGA card (initially $300) could be left out to save money. While including the CGA card and connecting an existing TV set for use as a monitor allowed users to forgo the purchase of a monitor, this was not significantly cheaper than buying a monochrome monitor (initially $345) and leaving out the CGA card. Also, 80-column text was almost unusable on color composite displays, and the IBM model 5153 CGA color video display that was required to fully exploit the CGA card's capabilities was even more expensive. Since a great many PCs were sold to businesses, the sharp, high-resolution monochrome text was more desirable for running applications.|$|E

40|$|Hamming Neural {{networks}} are employed for cursive text character separation and recognition. The digitized {{image of the}} scanned text is first enhanced by applying simple contrast stretching algorithm. Image registration is then performed to eliminate the white margins. Lines are separated by rows of white pixels and the morphological components identified. The projection method in conjunction with histogram analysis is used to estimate the width of each character in a word. The word is approximately decomposed into its constituent characters. The Hamming net is used to identify thus <b>separated</b> <b>characters,</b> while supposing the included portions of the adjacent characters as noise. The property of the trained Hamming net, i. e., the associative feature for detecting the best matched patterns from the prototype in a mean square sense, {{is the basis for}} constructing the recognition algorithm. Illustrative examples are presented and it is shown that the proposed approach is fast and efficient to provide an on-line separation and classification system for cursive texts such as Persian (Farsi), Arabic, Urdu and English script...|$|E
40|$|We present work in {{progress}} on the automated solving of text-based CAPTCHAs. Our method consists of two large components: firstly, we segment the text from the background. Afterwards, {{in order to identify}} the text, we extract features and use learning algorithms to classify each character. In particular, we developed a weighted k-means algorithm, which is largely able to segment the text portion of the CAPTCHA image. Additionally, we developed an algorithm to separate the individual characters. Finally, we explored classifying the <b>separated</b> <b>characters</b> using several methods, including through support vector machines and optical character recognition algorithms. We also present some current challenges we face in this algorithm, and some ideas we plan on exploring to overcome them. 2 Background information A completely automated public Turing test for telling computers and humans apart, or CAPTCHA, is used in many web-based applications. The most prevalent CAPTCHAs consist of an image of a sequence of distorted letters, which is purportedly difficult for a computer to solve, but easy for humans. CAPTCHAs are used to prevent the automation of certain tasks; for instance, they are often found on website registration forms, which helps ensure that each registration is from a human.

40|$|In sum, {{the three}} studies suggest that, on one hand, Chinese {{compound}} words, particularly the opaque ones, {{seem to be}} represented as holistic orthographic units in the mental lexicon. On the other hand, the meanings of the component morphemes are activated in visual recognition of Chinese compound words, suggesting a decomposed access. The implications of these results for a model of Chinese compound word representation and access, {{as well as the}} dispute between morpho-orthographic and morpho-semantic decomposition accounts of morphological processing in other languages, were discussed. Study 2 adapted the transposed-letter similarity effect in English (Forster, Davis, Schoknecht, & Carter, 1987; Acah & Perea, 2008) into transposed-character similarity effect in Chinese to further examine the orthographic representation of Chinese compound words. Study 2 examined the processing of both transposable and untransposable compound words to distinguish the decomposed account (which assumes morpheme-to-word activation) and the holistic account (which assumes activation of word-level orthographic representation) of the mental representation of Chinese compound words. It was found that transposable word-word pairs (e. g., [special characters omitted], means tie in English-[special characters omitted], means lead in English) did not produce significant priming effects. This result is inconsistent with the decomposed account, but is explicable in terms of the holistic account. Two follow-up experiments show that the transposed-character similarity effects differ for transparent (e. g., [special characters omitted], means proud in English) and opaque words (e. g., [special characters omitted], means careless in English). Transposed nonwords show significant facilitation effect to the original words when the original words were opaque (e. g., [special characters omitted]) but not when they were transparent words (e. g., [special characters omitted]). It suggests that opaque words are more likely than transparent words to be represented as orthographic wholes. The findings of word-level orthographic representation and the influence of semantic transparency provide convergent evidence for the conclusions reached by Study 1. The first two studies are concerned with whether Chinese two-character compound words have decomposed or holistic orthographic representations in the mental lexicon. Study 1 made use of the high frequency orthographic neighbor inhibition effect (Grainger & Jacobs, 1996; Davis & Lupker, 2006) in the masked priming paradigm. It was found that a high frequency orthographic neighbor (e. g., [special characters omitted] means virtually in English) inhibited recognition of a low frequency target word (e. g., [special characters omitted], means brief in English). The high frequency orthographic neighbor inhibition effect was supposed to be caused by lexical competition between prime and target words (Grainger & Jacobs, 1996). Therefore, the observation of inhibition in Study 1 suggests that the prime words have word-level representations that compete with those of target words for lexical access. It is argued that the activated word-level lexical representation is likely to be orthographic representation, rather than phonological and semantic representations, because the influence of phonology was found to be limited in a follow-up experiment, and the semantic relatedness between the prime and target words was low. Furthermore, because the inhibition effects were stronger for semantically opaque than transparent compound words, it seems that opaque words are more likely than transparent words to be represented as unitary units. The third study investigated whether or not the meaning of a component morpheme would be activated in the process of recognizing a Chinese two-character compound word. Current accounts of morphological processing disagree on whether morphological processing is form then meaning, or form with meaning (Feldman, O'Connor, & Del Prado Martin, 2009; Davis & Rastle, 2010). The focus of the debate is actually whether morpheme meaning activation occurs at early stage of compound word processing. This study attempted to contribute to that debate by trying to dissociate morphological processing of form and meaning. The method was to investigate masked priming effects produced by prime-target pairs that contained a pair of semantically related morphemes but without any overlap in orthography, phonology or whole-word meaning (e. g., [special characters omitted] /surprised in English/-[special characters omitted]/break one's promise in English/). Since there was no overlap between the prime and the target in form, any priming effects produced could be attributed unequivocally to activation of morpheme meaning (e. g., [special characters omitted], both means eat in English). The results of Study 3 show that morpheme meaning activation without form overlap occurred as early as the first 60 ms of word processing. This finding is more consistent with the form-with-meaning than the form-then-meaning account. This dissertation reports on three studies of the cognitive representations and processes in visual recognition of Chinese two-character compound words. Because Chinese two-character compound words are composed of two spatially <b>separated</b> <b>characters</b> which themselves are words, there has been a debate about whether these words are represented and processed in the mental lexicon as unitary wholes or as combinations of the component characters (Zhang & Peng, 1992; Taft & Zhu, 1995).
