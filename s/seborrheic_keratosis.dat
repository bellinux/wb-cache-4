50|$|A <b>{{seborrheic}}</b> <b>keratosis,</b> {{also known}} as seborrheic verruca, basal cell papilloma, or a senile wart, is a non-cancerous (benign) skin tumour that originates from cells in the outer layer of the skin (keratinocytes). Like liver spots, seborrheic keratoses are seen more often as people age.|$|E
5000|$|The tumours (also called lesions) {{appear in}} various colours, from light tan to black. They are round or oval, feel flat or {{slightly}} elevated, like the scab from a healing wound, and {{range in size}} from very small to more than 2.5 cm across. They can often come in association with other skin conditions, including basal cell carcinoma. Sometimes <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> and basal cell carcinoma occur at the same location, and sometimes <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> progresses to basal cell carcinoma. At clinical examination the differential diagnosis include warts and melanoma. Because only the top layers of the epidermis are involved, seborrheic keratoses are often described as having a [...] "pasted on" [...] appearance.

It may reduce wrinkles, acne scarring, hyperpigmentation and improve many other skin conditions, including actinic keratosis, hyperkeratosis, and <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis.</b> Once applied, glycolic acid reacts with the upper layer of the epidermis, weakening the binding properties of the lipids that hold the dead skin cells together. This allows the stratum corneum to be exfoliated, exposing live skin cells. Highly purified grades of glycolic acid are commercially available for personal care applications.|$|E
5000|$|Clear cell {{acanthoma}} (also {{known as}} [...] "Acanthome cellules claires of Degos and Civatte," [...] "Degos acanthoma," [...] and [...] "Pale cell acanthoma") is a benign clinical and histological lesion initially described as neoplastic, which some authors now {{regard as a}} reactive dermatosis. It usually presents as a moist solitary firm, brown-red, well-circumscribed, 5 mm to 2 cm nodule or plaque on the lower extremities of middle-aged to elderly individuals The lesion has a crusted, scaly peripheral collarette and vascular puncta on the surface. It is characterized by slow growth, and may persist for years. The clinical differential diagnosis includes: dermatofibroma, inflamed <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis,</b> pyogenic granuloma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, verruca vulgaris, psoriatic plaque, and melanoma.|$|E
50|$|Basal cell carcinomas {{can often}} come in {{association}} with other lesions of the skin, such as actinic keratosis, <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis,</b> squamous cell carcinoma.

The cause of this syndrome is a mutation in the PTCH1 tumor suppressor gene located in chromosome 9q22.3, which inhibits the hedgehog signaling pathway. A mutation in the SMO gene, which is also on the hedgehog pathway, also causes basal-cell carcinoma.|$|E
40|$|<b>Seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> is {{a benign}} {{epithelial}} neoplasia that occurs {{mainly in the}} skin of the eyelids and face. We describe a case of <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> of the conjunctiva confirmed by histopathology. A 72 -year-old man presented with a recurrent conjunctival mass involving the nasal side of his right eye. Clinically, a diagnosis of conjunctival papilloma was made, and a mass excision was performed. The histopathological analysis evidenced a conjunctivalcovering epithelium with papillomatous changes and irregular acanthosis, at the expense of a proliferation of basaloid cells. In addition, the lesion exhibited multiple pseudohorn cysts containing keratin. With the above findings, a diagnosis of conjunctival <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> was established. The occurrence of <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> on the conjunctiva is rare. In this case, <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> was confirmed by pathologic report despite its similar appearance with papilloma. <b>Seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of conjunctival lesions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> is {{the most}} common benign {{epidermal}} lesion in the world, especially among the elderly. Its inherent benign nature has precluded the need to remove it for medical reasons. Most of the concerns presented to dermatologists or plastic surgeons are of cosmetic reasons, besides some unusual appearances that necessitate cutaneous malignancy evaluation. Unusually large sizes of <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> are rarely reported, and its clinical significance is largely unknown. It has been proven by recent molecular studies that <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> is true neoplasia rather than a mere epidermal hyperplasia, and various authors have reported several cases of concomitant malignancy arising from <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis.</b> Plastic surgeon expertise is often required when faced with an extensive lesion, requiring reconstructive procedures to preserve good aesthetic and functional outcomes.

40|$|Background : <b>Seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> is a  common {{benign tumor}} of unclear etiology. Aim : To study {{associations}} between clinical characteristics of <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> and its course with quantitative {{parameters of the}} β-genus human papillomavirus (β-HPV). Materials and methods : The main study group included 91 patients with <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> (29 male and 62 female), aged 40 to 75   years (mean±SD, 59. 2 ± 6. 4 years). The control group included 30 healthy individuals persons aged 40 to 70 years (mean 57. 6 ± 4. 1 years). The diagnosis of <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> was confirmed by dermoscopy and pathomorphological assessment, with 100 % of patients having the acanthotic type of <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis.</b> HPV was identified by polymerase chain reaction with hybridization fluorescent detection in real time mode with use of three oligonucleotide systems for detection of HPV genus β 1 (subtypes 5, 8, 12, 14, 19, 21, 25, 36, 47); β 2 (subtypes 9, 15, 17, 22, 23, 37, 38, 80), and β 3 (subtypes 49, 75, 76). Results: The most frequent clinical type of <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> was the maculopapular one (61 / 91 patients, 67 %) localized mainly on head, neck, anterior and posterior trunk. β-HPV was found in 88. 8 % biopsy samples taken from the <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> areas in 24 of 27 patients and in 66. 6 % biopsy samples taken from the normal skin areas of the same patients (р= 0. 04). This is significantly more frequent that the HPV contamination among healthy individuals, which was 28. 7 % (р= 0. 02). Mixed association of β-HPV was also more frequent in the HPV-positive patients (21 / 24, or 83. 3 %; compared to the control group, р= 0, 00001). The maximal (significant) viral load {{was found in the}} subgroup of <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> patients with the number of proliferative lesions of 10 and more (4. 08 ± 0. 3 lg/ 105 tо 5. 7 ± 0, 3 lg/ 105). Conclusion: The maculopapular type of <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> is characterized by mixed HPV β 1, β 2, β 3 infection found in 77. 7 % of cases irrespective of the number of proliferative lesions. It could be hypothesized that multiple <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> (more than 10 lesions) develops in simultaneous presence of HPV β 1, β 2, β 3 and is associated with a  higher probability of new <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> lesions on intact skin.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> is a common, benign skin tumor. Numerous {{reports have}} shown its {{possibility}} of malignant transformation. This {{study was designed}} to demonstrate the occurrence of concomitant <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> and skin cancers. Materials and Methods : Data was retrospectively reviewed from all patients with a diagnosis of <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> in pathology department of Alzahra Hospital and a private pathology laboratory in Isfahan, Iran over a 4 -year period. We classified all demographic data and associated dysplasia or Bowen′s disease and analyzed them by student-t or chi-square tests. Results : From all 429 specimens, 5 (1. 2 %) were found to be associated with Bowen′s disease and one (0. 2 %) with mild dysplasia in squamous epithelium. All cases arose within the clinically, atypical <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis.</b> More men were affected with lesions alone and with malignancy (230 / 423 (54. 4 %) and 5 / 6 (83. 3 %), respectively) compared to women. The average age of patients suffering from lesions with and without associated malignancy was 57 and 54 years, respectively. The common site of lesion alone was head and neck but lesions with malignancy involved lower extremities. The two lesions were significantly different in site of occurrence (p < 0. 001). Conclusion : Generally, although the association between <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> and skin malignancy appears to be accidental, it must always be in mind. Therefore, histopathologic examination of all <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> should be considered, especially when <b>seborrheic</b> <b>keratosis</b> has atypical clinical manifestations...|$|E
