40|$|Several {{studies using}} {{vegetable}} fibers as the exclusive reinforcement in fiber-cement composites have shown acceptable mechanical {{performance at the}} first ages. However, after the exposure to accelerated aging tests, these composites have shown significant reduction in the toughness or increase in embrittlement. This was mainly attributed to the improved fiber-matrix adhesion and fiber mineralization after aging process. The objective of the present research was to evaluate composites produced by the <b>slurry</b> <b>dewatering</b> technique followed by pressing and air curing, reinforced with combinations of polypropylene fibers and sisal kraft pulp at different pulp freeness. The physical properties, mechanical performance, and microstructural characteristics of the composites were evaluated before and after accelerated and natural aging. Results showed the great contribution of pulp refinement on {{the improvement of the}} mechanical strength in the composites. Higher intensities of refinement resulted in higher modulus of rupture for the composites with hybrid reinforcement after accelerated and natural aging. The more compact microstructure was due to the improved packing of the mineral particles with refined sisal pulp. The toughness of the composites after aging was maintained in relation to the composites at 28 days of cure.

40|$|Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) {{has been}} tasked by Bechtel National Inc. (BNI) on the River Protection Project-Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (RPP-WTP) project to perform {{research}} and development activities to resolve technical issues identified for the Pretreatment Facility (PTF). The Pretreatment Engineering Platform (PEP) was designed and constructed and is to be operated {{as part of a}} plan to respond to issue M 12, “Undemonstrated Leaching Processes. ” The PEP is a 1 / 4. 5 -scale test platform designed to simulate the WTP pretreatment caustic leaching, oxidative leaching, ultrafiltration solids concentration, and slurry washing processes. The PEP replicates the WTP leaching processes using prototypic equipment and control strategies. The PEP also includes non-prototypic ancillary equipment to support the core processing. Two operating scenarios are currently being evaluated for the ultrafiltration process (UFP) and leaching operations. The first scenario has caustic leaching performed in the UFP- 2 ultrafiltration feed vessels (i. e., vessel UFP-VSL-T 02 A in the PEP; and vessels UFP-VSL- 00002 A and B in the WTP PTF). The second scenario has caustic leaching conducted in the UFP- 1 ultrafiltration feed preparation vessels (i. e., vessels UFP-VSL-T 01 A and B in the PEP; vessels UFP-VSL- 00001 A and B in the WTP PTF). In both scenarios, 19 -M sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH, caustic) is added to the waste slurry in the vessels to dissolve solid aluminum compounds (e. g., gibbsite, boehmite). Caustic addition is followed by a heating step that uses direct steam injection to accelerate the leaching process. Following the caustic leach, the vessel contents are cooled using vessel cooling jackets and/or external heat exchangers. The main difference between the two scenarios is that for leaching in UFP 1, the 19 -M NaOH is added to un-concentrated waste slurry (3 to 8 wt% solids), while for leaching in UFP 2, the slurry is concentrated to nominally 20 wt% solids using cross-flow ultrafiltration before the addition of caustic. For wastes that have significantly high chromium content, the caustic leaching and <b>slurry</b> <b>dewatering</b> is followed by adding sodium permanganate to UFP-VSL-T 02 A, and the slurry is subjected to oxidative leaching at nominally ambient temperature. The purpose of the oxidative leaching is to selectively oxidize the poorly alkaline-soluble Cr(III) believed to be the insoluble form in Hanford tank sludge to the much more alkaline-soluble Cr(VI), e. g., chromate. The work described in this report provides the test results that are related to the efficiency of the oxidative leaching process to support process modeling based on tests performed with a Hanford waste simulant. The tests were completed both at the lab-bench scale and in the PEP. The purpose of this report is to summarize the results from both scales that are related to oxidative leaching chemistry to support a scale factor for the submodels {{to be used in the}} G 2 model, which predicts WTP operating performance. Owing to schedule constraints, the PEP test data to be included in this report are limited to those from Integrated Tests A (T 01 A/B caustic leaching) and B (T 02 A caustic leaching) ...|$|E

40|$|Roofing {{provides}} the main protection against {{direct solar radiation}} in animal housing. Appropriate thermal properties of roofing materials tend to improve the thermal comfort in the inner ambient. Nonasbestos fiber-cement roofing components reinforced with cellulose pulp from sisal (Agave sisalana) were produced by <b>slurry</b> and <b>dewatering</b> techniques, with an optional addition of polypropylene fibers. Nonasbestos tiles were evaluated and compared with commercially available asbestos-cement sheets and ceramic tiles (frequently chosen as roofing materials for animal housing). Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of tiles were determined by the parallel hot-wire method, along with {{the evaluation of the}} downside surface temperature. Cement-based components reinforced with sisal pulp presented better thermal performance at room temperature (25 ºC), while those reinforced with sisal pulp added by polypropylene fibers presented better thermal performance at 60 ºC.

40|$|Dewatering of ultra-fine (minus 150 {micro}m) {{coal slurry}} {{to less than}} 20 % {{moisture}} is difficult using the conventional dewatering techniques. The main objective {{of the project was}} to evaluate a novel surface modification technique, which utilizes the synergistic effect of metal ions and surfactants in combination for the dewatering of ultra-fine clean-coal <b>slurries</b> using various <b>dewatering</b> techniques on a proof-of-concept (POC) scale of 0. 5 to 2 tons per hour. The addition of conventional reagents and the application of coal surface modification technique were evaluated using vacuum filtration, hyperbaric (pressure) filtration, ceramic plate filtration and screen-bowl centrifuge techniques.

40|$|Geotextile {{tubes are}} {{manufactured}} by sewing {{one or more}} layers of high-strength permeable woven/non-woven geotextiles together to form tubes that are later filled with high-water content materials by hydraulic pumping. Recently, Moo-Young et al. (2002), Kutay (2002), and Aydilek and Edil (2002), have conducted laboratory studies which concluded that the apparent opening size (AOS 1) alone {{is not a good}} indicator to predict the filtration behavior of geotextile tubes. Therefore, the current filtration criteria based on apparent opening size do not apply for geotextile tubes. When geotextile tubes are used in <b>dewatering</b> <b>slurries,</b> a filer cake forms on the interface of the soil and geotextile. The formation of the filter cake, which leads to the retention of the soil particles, can be controlled by the pore openings of the geotextile, the particle size distribution of the soil, the water content of slurry, and the pumping pressure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to study the effect of the large-pore openings of geotextiles on the filtration performance of geotextile materials. In this paper, filtration behavior of three woven geotextiles is studied using the pressure filtration tests on three natural soil sediments.

40|$|The use of {{asbestos}} fibres in construction products has been banned in European countries for about two decades due to its effect on human health. At present, many developing countries use asbestos cement board {{as one of the}} most important construction products for roofing, cladding and partition walls. The Hatschek process is the most commonly used method to produce asbestos Fibre Cement Board (FCB). There are two major problems for the asbestos FCB manufacturers in replacing their products with non-asbestos FCB. The first one is finding materials and fibres that are available and competitive in price compared to asbestos fibres, and the second is providing inexpensive machines and equipment to produce non-asbestos FCB. In this research, an effort has been made to solve these two major problems. After the initial laboratory investigations on several natural and synthetic fibres some of the fibres with potential use in FCB were chosen for the further investigations. A <b>slurry</b> vacuum <b>dewatering</b> process was then designed and made for the laboratory use. The performance of material selections and mix designs selected from the laboratory studies were subsequently verified with factory Hatschek process in a factory site trial. Many specimens with natural and synthetic fibres incorporating silica fume and limestone powder were made and tested in the laboratory. Silica fume and limestone powder were used for enhancing flexural strength and suppression of alkalinity to reduce breakdown of the cellulose fibres. The results of mechanical, physical and II durability tests were analysed. The microstructure of the fibres and composites was also studied by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). At some stages, mix design optimization was carried out to gain the highest flexural strength. The most suitable mixes were chosen for the factory site trials. A number of full-scale non-asbestos trial boards were made successfully in an asbestos FCB factory and tested in accordance with the current national and international standards. The results indicated that the trial boards fulfilled the requirements of the relevant standards. Based on the outcome of this research, a combination of acrylic fibres and waste cardboard in a mix incorporating silica fume and limestone powder in addition to Portland cement can be used to replace asbestos fibres. Although broadly compatible with the asbestos cement production process, this formulation change will necessitate some changes to the existing production lines in asbestos cement factories to produce non-asbestos FCB...|$|R
40|$|The project {{proposal}} was approved {{for only the}} phase I period. The goal for this Phase I project was to develop an industrial model that can perform continuous and efficient dewatering of fine coal slurries of the previous flotation process to fine coal cake of {approx} 15 % water content from 50 - 70 %. The feasibility of this model should be demonstrated experimentally using a lab scale setup. The Phase I project was originally for one year, from May 2005 to May 2006. With DOE approval, the project was extended to Dec. 2006 without additional cost from DOE to accomplish the work. Water {{has been used in}} mining for a number of purposes such as a carrier, washing liquid, dust-catching media, fire-retardation media, temperature-control media, and solvent. When coal is cleaned in wet-processing circuits, waste streams containing water, fine coal, and noncombustible particles (ash-forming minerals) are produced. In many coal preparation plants, the fine waste stream is fed into a series of selection processes where fine coal particles are recovered from the mixture to form diluted coal fine <b>slurries.</b> A <b>dewatering</b> process is then needed to reduce the water content to about 15 %- 20 % so that the product is marketable. However, in the dewatering process currently used in coal preparation plants, coal fines smaller than 45 micrometers are lost, and in many other plants, coal fines up to 100 micrometers are also wasted. These not-recovered coal fines are mixed with water and mineral particles of the similar particle size range and discharged to impoundment. The wasted water from coal preparation plants containing unrecoverable coal fine and mineral particles are called tailings. With time the amount of wastewater accumulates occupying vast land space while it appears as threat to the environment. This project developed a special extruder and demonstrated its application in solid-liquid separation of coal slurry, tailings containing coal fines mostly less than 50 micron. The extruder is special because all of its auger surface and the internal barrier surface are covered with the membranes allowing water to drain and solid particles retained. It is believed that there are four mechanisms working together in the dewatering process. They are hydrophilic diffusion flow, pressure flow, agitation and air purging. Hydrophilic diffusion flow is effective with hydrophilic membrane. Pressure flow is due to the difference of hydraulic pressure between {{the two sides of the}} membrane. Agitation is provided by the rotation of the auger. Purging is achieved with the air blow from the near bottom of the extruder, which is in vertical direction...|$|R
40|$|After {{five years}} of {{extensive}} R&D sponsored by government and industry, the coal log pipeline (CLP) technology for transportation of coal has been sufficiently developed through laboratory tests to warrant large-scale pre-commercial demonstration and testing. Meanwhile, {{a national survey of}} electric utilities and coal companies has produced fourteen potential CLP demonstration sites. A preliminary evaluation of the sites determined that at least seven of the fourteen sites are economically promising. The purpose of this EPRI-TC proposal is to conduct a large-scale pre-commercial test/demo of CLP {{to pave the way for}} commercial demonstration. Completion of this pre-commercial test/demo project in two years will enable construction of the first commercial CLP with minimum risk involved and with maximum success. The CLP technology involves compaction of coal into logs (large circular coal cylinders), and the transportation of such logs by an underground pipeline to the user [...] a power generation station. It is an innovative new coal pipeline system that can effectively compete with railroads and truck transportation. The economics of CLP has been thoroughly examined in 1995. It was found that the CLP is economically competitive with train for distances greater than about 100 miles, and competitive with truck for distances greater than about 30 miles. As compared to coal slurry pipeline, the CLP has the following advantages: (1) CLP transports twice as much coal than a coal slurry pipeline of the same diameter can. The cost of coal transportation by CLP is substantially lower than by <b>slurry</b> pipeline. (2) <b>Dewatering</b> coal logs is much simpler than <b>dewatering</b> <b>slurry.</b> (3) CLP can be restarted readily after lengthy shutdown. It has no restart problem. (4) CLP uses less energy than slurry pipeline for transporting the same amount of coal. (5) Coal log fuel is most versatile. Upon crushing it can be burned in any type of combustors [...] pulverized-coal, cyclone, fluidized-bed, or stoker. (6) Storage of coal logs is much simpler than storage of coal slurry. (7) CLP uses only 1 / 3 to 1 / 4 of the water used by slurry pipeline. This makes CLP more feasible than slurry pipeline in regions of water shortage. Development of the CLP technology will benefit electric utilities by reducing coal transportation cost [...] not only through use of CLP, but also due to the competition fostered which will cause rail rates and truck rates to keep within bounds. The pre-commercial test/demo project proposed herein contains four major components or tasks: (1) construction of a 6 -inch-diameter, 3, 000 -ft-long coal pipeline for testing coal logs under conditions similar to those of future commercial CLP; (2) construction and testing of a coal log machine that can rapidly manufacture coal logs to supply coal log pipelines; (3) conducting a site-specific application study for each participating utilities; and (4) conducting an economic analysis of future commercial CLP systems using information gained in this study, and following EPRI cost guidelines. The project is for two years at a total cost of $ 825, 960 of which $ 500, 000 is requested from EPRI and participating utilities. As an EPRI Tailored Collaboration project, each participating utility is asked to contribute a total of $ 60, 000 over two years (with equal matching from EPRI) to support this project. The targeted amount from utilities and EPRI for this project is $ 600, 000 of which $ 100, 000 is indirect cost to be used by EPRI to administer this project. This targeted amount can be achieved with five electric utilities participating. The project will also be cost-shared with $ 325, 960 of the existing funds of the Capsule Pipeline Research Center (CPRC). Currently, the CPRC has insufficient funds to carry out this project without support from EPRI and some additional utility companies.
