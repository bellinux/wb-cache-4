50|$|Esound (ESD) is a {{stand-alone}} sound daemon that abstracts the system <b>sound</b> <b>device</b> to multiple clients. Under Linux using the Open Sound System (OSS), {{as well as}} other UNIX systems, typically only one process may open the <b>sound</b> <b>device.</b> This is not acceptable in a desktop environment like GNOME, as it is expected that many applications will be making sounds (music decoders, event based sounds, video conferencing, etc.). The ESD daemon connects to the <b>sound</b> <b>device</b> and accepts connections from multiple clients, mixing the incoming audio streams and sending the result to the <b>sound</b> <b>device.</b> Connections are only allowed to clients that can authenticate successfully, alleviating the concern that unauthorized users can eavesdrop via the <b>sound</b> <b>device.</b> In addition to accepting client connections from the local machine, ESD can be configured to accept client connections from remote hosts that authenticate successfully.|$|E
50|$|Also {{available}} at the time were a number of smaller devices, such as an SDS-EPB E-PROM Blower to write samples onto the chips, a Digital ClapTrap unit, which is a digital clap <b>sound</b> <b>device,</b> a sound very popular in 1980s music.|$|E
50|$|Devices {{designed}} for surround output may use multiple jacks for paired channels (e.g. TRS for front left and right; TRRS for front center, rear center, and subwoofer; and TRS for surround left and right). Circuitry on the <b>sound</b> <b>device</b> {{may be used}} to switch between traditional Line In/Line Out/Mic functions and surround output.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Chase {{arrives and}} helps Tall Man escape, but are {{pursued by the}} {{creature}}. The creature quickly gains the upper hand and almost kills Chase. Max uses Peniston's <b>sound</b> <b>device</b> to distract the creature. It attacks him, but he uses a zipline to escape. Peniston takes the <b>sound</b> <b>device</b> and lures the creature into the pressure chamber. Dr. Chase urges Peniston not {{to stay in the}} pressure chamber with the creature, but Peniston refuses to leave saying he can't let the creature die alone. Dr. Chase locks them in and activates it, building greater and greater pressure. The creature kills Peniston. Chase allows the pressure to build up very high then smashes the window causing all the air to come out. This causes explosive decompression and the creature explodes, finally killing it. Later, the survivors walk into the sun set ready to board the boat, presumably to go back to town and never return to the island.|$|E

5000|$|Man-Ape {{appears in}} The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episode [...] "The Man in the Ant Hill" [...] voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. He {{challenges}} T'Chaka for {{the throne of}} Wakanda and kills him in combat with some unseen help from Klaw. As Man-Ape takes the throne, T'Challa leaves and becomes Black Panther in order to prepare to take back Wakanda from Man-Ape. With Wakanda under their control, Man-Ape and Klaw have the Wakandans mine for Vibranium. In the episode [...] "Panther's Quest," [...] Man-Ape speaks with Grim Reaper about HYDRA's purchasing of the Vibranium. He tells Grim Reaper that if he and HYDRA double-cross him, he won't live to regret it. Black Panther and Captain America confront Man-Ape who sends the guards to fight them. While Captain America fights the guards, Man-Ape ends up fighting Black Panther where Man-Ape uses a <b>sound</b> <b>device</b> {{given to him by}} Klaw. Black Panther overcomes the <b>sound</b> <b>device</b> and takes down Man-Ape liberating Wakanda from Man-Ape's rule.|$|E
50|$|Those cards {{which offer}} {{hardware}} mixing include professional multichannel audio interfaces, currently manufacturers do not indicate if a sound card uses a hardware mixing capability. Some manufacturers list features {{provided by the}} driver(software) which would indicate the <b>sound</b> <b>device</b> being a software driven card and not incorporating a hardware mixer. In the Windows Operating System, DxDiag {{can be used to}} test if the audio hardware supports hardware mixing.|$|E
50|$|Directional Sound {{refers to}} the notion of using various devices to create fields of sound which spread less than most (small) {{traditional}} loudspeakers. Several techniques are available to accomplish this, and each has its benefits and drawbacks. Ultimately, choosing a directional <b>sound</b> <b>device</b> depends greatly on the environment in which it is deployed as well as the content that will be reproduced. Keeping these factors in mind will yield the best results through any evaluation of directional sound technologies.|$|E

50|$|The blowing horn or winding horn is a <b>sound</b> <b>device</b> that {{is usually}} made of or shaped like an animal horn, {{arranged}} to blow from {{a hole in the}} pointed end of it. This rudimentary device had a variety of functions in many cultures, in most cases reducing its scope to exhibiting, celebratory or group identification purposes (signal instrument). On the other hand, it has kept its function and profile in many cattle raising, agricultural and hunter-gatherer societies.|$|E
50|$|The Sound Blaster Roar {{is about}} the size of a {{dictionary}} and weighs 1.10 kg (2.5 lbs). It supports aptX, AAC and SBC Bluetooth codecs. It can be used as a USB <b>sound</b> <b>device</b> on Mac and Windows computers. The supported operating systems are Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows 7, 8 and 8.1.

50|$|In some jurisdictions such as Australia and Ireland {{pedestrian}} {{lights are}} associated with a <b>sound</b> <b>device,</b> for the benefit of blind and visually impaired pedestrians. These make a slow beeping sound when the pedestrian lights are red and a continuous buzzing sound when the lights are green. In the Australian States of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia, the sound is produced in the same unit as the push buttons. This system of assistive technology is also widely used at busy intersections in Canadian cities.|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{high-resolution}} television cameras, thermometers, pressure meters, and seismographs {{are other}} notable instruments for deep-sea exploration invented by the technological advance. These instruments are either lowered {{to the sea}} bottom by long cables or directly attached to submersible buoys. Deep-sea currents can be studied by floats carrying an ultrasonic <b>sound</b> <b>device</b> so that their movements can be tracked from aboard the research vessel. Such vessels themselves are equipped with state -of-art navigational instruments, such as satellite navigation systems, and global positioning systems that keep the vessel in a live position relative to a sonar beacon {{on the bottom of}} the ocean.|$|E
5000|$|The US {{has also}} made {{regulatory}} changes to limit torture trade. The Department of Commerce created a separate export commodity code for electro-shock devices {{to make it easier}} to track them. All companies are now required to have export licenses, although there are still many loopholes. US companies can use drop shipping or paying an intermediary country with loose regulations to export banned goods to the importing country. In 1997, one US company was caught exporting electro-shock guns and pepper spray without a license by mislabeling them as “Fountain pens, Keychains, Child <b>Sound</b> <b>device,</b> and Electrical voltage units.” ...|$|E
50|$|The series starred Laraine Newman of Saturday Night Live fame, {{whose main}} character, Laraine the usherette, wore an old-fashioned maroon ushers uniform {{and ran the}} Ritz with such strict {{organization}} as to assign every patron a seat despite the theater's constant near-empty attendance. Laraine ensured that each movie started exactly on time as scheduled, cuing her mother in the production booth via a microphone. Laraine's mother was never actually named nor completely seen during any of the episodes, but sometimes communicated by pounding on the walls or playing musical tunes (presumably with an instrument or a <b>sound</b> <b>device</b> in the booth and transmitted through the theater's sound system).|$|E

50|$|Applications {{wanting to}} contact the ESD daemon do so using the libesd library. Much like with file i/o, a ESD {{connection}} is first opened. The ESD daemon will be spawned automatically by libesd if a daemon is not already present. Data is then either read or written to the ESD daemon. For an ESD client local to the machine that the ESD daemon is running on, the data is transferred through a local socket, then written to the <b>sound</b> <b>device</b> by the ESD daemon. For a client on a remote machine, the data is sent by libesd on the remote machine over the network to the ESD daemon. The process is completely transparent to the application using ESD.|$|E
5000|$|The great comedians of the inter-war Romanian stage, Stroe and Vasilache, managed, {{with the}} help of a Romanian engineer, Argani, who had put {{together}} a <b>sound</b> <b>device,</b> to produce the only entirely domestic film of the period, titled Bing-Bang (1934). As film posters noted, it was a [...] "humorous musical" [...] based on a script by Argani, Stroe and Vasilache; with camerawork by I. Bartok; music by N. Stroe and Vasile Vasilache; musical arrangements by Mihai Constantinescu and Max Halm; and starring N. Stroe, Vasile Vasilache, Nora Piacenti, Grigore Vasiliu Birlic, Titi Botez, C. Calmuschi, Silly Vasiliu, Nutzi Pantazi, Lucica Părvulescu, Richard Rang, Alexandru Brunetti, and Alexandru Giovani. Its premiere took place on 7 February 1935 at the Arpa cinema (inside the Bucharest Cercul Militar).|$|E
50|$|The {{reasoning}} behind using emulation {{instead of}} real hardware was cost and demand. FM synthesis hardware support for {{games at the}} time required an additional chip, the Yamaha OPL-2 or OPL-3. At the time Soundscape arrived, most games supported General MIDI output, offering high-quality music support for users who purchased the card and reducing the need for said OPL-3 synthesis chip. The board's SoundBlaster support could be toggled on and off, allowing use of a second sound card (usually an existing <b>sound</b> <b>device)</b> {{to take care of}} the actual OPL-3 FM synthesis if desired. The advantage of a single card that could do either, however, was very important for mind share amongst consumers, and was critical for OEM system sellers because adding a separate card would add cost to the system.|$|E
