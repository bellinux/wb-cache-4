In addition, we assume that this upstream rm can price discriminate between two groups of retail rms: the retail rms which (now) own a stake in its capital and all of their retail rivals. We nd that price discrimination is optimal and, compared to a vertical separation scenario, there is input foreclosure, a higher retail price and lower social welfare, which suggests that, from a competition policy viewpoint, such partial vertical integrations should be analysed with particular concern. However, conducting a private placement operation of the upstream rm s capital yields gains from trade and {{we are able to}} identify the optimal characteristics of such an operation. info:eu-repo/semantics/draf...|$|E

O artigo descreve as mudanças recentes nas formas de funcionamento do capitalismo contemporâneo baseada no papel autônomo alcançado pela esfera financeira. Discutindo com várias propostas de explicação do fenômeno, ele propõe uma explicação que acentua o caráter ao mesmo tempo paradoxal, contingente e contraditório do processo que estamos vivendo. A forma atual é originária dos países anglo-saxões e se espraia rumo aos demais países desenvolvidos e em desenvolvimento. Nos Estados Unidos e Inglaterra chegou-se a situação, para muitos pouco esperada, em que a quantidade de famílias detentoras de patrimônio acionário relevante ultrapassa o número de trabalhadores diretamente engajados nas empresas que estão cotadas nos mercados, dando centralidade ao mercado financeiro na criação e distribuição de riquezas daquelas sociedades. Entretanto, os autores argumentam que esse processo está baseado em hipóteses dificilmente realizáveis relativamente à capacidade das empresas fornecerem no longo prazo o volume de dividendos necessário para satisfazerem as expectativas e necessidades dos investidores...|$|E

Multinational companies from the US, Japan, and Europe have led their way in using China as off-shoring platform for the labor-intensive stages of goods production. China currently has an account surplus of 6 - 7 per cent of their GDP and has accumulated more reserves than any country <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world at approximately US$ 300 trillion. Given its standing {{as one of the}} major suppliers of global <b>capital,</b> Chinese government <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recent years has been pursuing a policy of outward FDI under which some of the state-owned Chinese enterprises have been provided with soft capital to become global leaders on the lines of Japanese and Korean trading houses. The financial crisis of 2007 / 08 had enabled the Chinese government an opportunity to provide <b>capital</b> to companies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> developed and developing world who are currently starved for financing. The analytical framework of internationalization theory suggests that one should look into the motivations for internationalization and the literatures identified the following drivers of internationalization process: (a) Market-seeking FDI, (b) Resource-seeking FDI, (c) Efficiency seeking FDI and (d) Strategic asset-seeking FDI. Using the case study of PETROBRAS and MMX Mining <b>in</b> Brazil, <b>the</b> study found that major driver of investment by Chinese companies is in acquisition of strategic assets for China's future development. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of PETROBRAS, the mode of investment was supplier's credit rather than the traditional FDI or portfolio investment. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of MMX, it was <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> equity <b>capital</b> of <b>the</b> firm. Thus, the modern modes of outward FDI by Chinese firms are more roundabout forms rather than the traditional modes of Foreign Direct Investment and Foreign Portfolio Investments addressed by most researchers.
