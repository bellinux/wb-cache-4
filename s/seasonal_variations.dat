40|$|Abstract Background <b>Seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> in the {{occurrence}} of cardiovascular diseases has been recognized for decades. In particular, incidence rates of hospitalization with atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke have shown to exhibit a <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation.</b> Stroke in AF patients is common and often severe. Obtaining {{a description of a}} possible <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> in {{the occurrence}} of stroke in AF patients is crucial in clarifying risk factors for developing stroke and initiating prophylaxis treatment. Methods Using a dynamic generalized linear model we were able to model gradually changing <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> in hospitalization rates of stroke in AF patients from 1977 to 2011. The study population consisted of all Danes registered with a diagnosis of AF comprising 270, 017 subjects. During follow-up, 39, 632 subjects were hospitalized with stroke. Incidence rates of stroke in AF patients were analyzed assuming the <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> being a sum of two sinusoids and a local linear trend. Results The results showed that the peak-to-trough ratio decreased from 1. 25 to 1. 16 during the study period, and that the times of year for peak and trough changed slightly. Conclusion The present study indicates that using dynamic generalized linear models provides a flexible modeling approach for studying changes in <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> of stroke in AF patients and yields plausible results. </p...|$|R
5|$|A 2004 {{study by}} Kathryn Thomas and Sandra Carlson used teeth {{from the upper}} jaw of three {{individuals}} interpreted as a juvenile, a subadult, and an adult, recovered from a bone bed in the Hell Creek Formation of Corson County, South Dakota. In this study, successive teeth in columns in the edmontosaurs' dental batteries were sampled from multiple locations along each tooth using a microdrilling system. This sampling method {{takes advantage of the}} organization of hadrosaurid dental batteries to find variation in tooth isotopes over a period of time. From their work, it appears that edmontosaur teeth took less than about 0.65years to form, slightly faster in younger edmontosaurs. The teeth of all three individuals appeared to show variation in oxygen isotope ratios that could correspond to warm/dry and cool/wet periods; Thomas and Carlson considered the possibility that the animals were migrating instead, but favored local <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations</b> because migration would have more likely led to ratio homogenization, as many animals migrate to stay within specific temperature ranges or near particular food sources.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the paleoenvironment of the Ischigualasto Formation was a volcanically active {{floodplain}} covered by forests and subject to strong seasonal rainfalls. The climate was moist and warm, though subject to <b>seasonal</b> <b>variations.</b> Vegetation consisted of ferns (Cladophlebis), horsetails, and giant conifers (Protojuniperoxylon). These plants formed lowland forests {{along the banks of}} rivers. Herrerasaurus remains appear to have been the most common among the carnivores of the Ischigualasto Formation. It lived in the jungles of Late Triassic South America alongside another early dinosaur, the one-meter-long Eoraptor, as well as Saurosuchus, a giant land-living rauisuchian (a quadrupedal meat eater with a theropod-like skull); the broadly similar but smaller Venaticosuchus, an ornithosuchid; and the predatory therapsid chiniquodontids. Herbivores were much more abundant than carnivores and were represented by rhynchosaurs such as Hyperodapedon (a beaked reptile); aetosaurs (spiny armored reptiles); and therapsids, including kannemeyeriid dicynodonts (stocky, front-heavy beaked quadrupedal animals) such as Ischigualastia and traversodontid cynodonts (somewhat similar in overall form to dicynodonts, but lacking beaks) such as Exaeretodon. These non-dinosaurian herbivores were much more abundant than early ornithischian dinosaurs like Pisanosaurus.|$|E

40|$|Pavement {{roughness}} is {{a common}} measure of pavement condition regularly measured by road authorities. An approach to recognize patterns of <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> in rural sealed granular pavement roughness by minimum message length (MML) inference is demonstrated in this article.

40|$|Background: Dystocia {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} causes of cesarean delivery in nulliparous women. Despite this, its causes are largely unknown. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) has been found in the myometrium. Thus, it is possible that vitamin D affects the contractility of the myometrium and may be involved in the pathogenesis of dystocia. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> of dystocia in areas with distinct <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> in sunlight exposure, like Denmark, could imply that vitamin D may play a role. This study examined whether there was <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> in the incidence of dystocia in a Danish population. Method: We used information from a cohort of 34, 261 nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies, spontaneous onset of labor between 37 and 42 completed gestational weeks, and vertex fetal presentation. All women gave birth between 1992 and 2010 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby. Logistic regression combined with cubic spline was used to estimate the <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> for each outcome after adjusting for calendar time. Results: No evidence for <b>seasonal</b> <b>variation</b> was found for any of the outcomes: acute cesarean delivery due to dystocia (p = 0. 44); instrumental vaginal delivery due to dystocia (p = 0. 69); oxytocin augmentation due to dystocia (p = 0. 46); and overall dystocia (p = 0. 91).
