6000|$|... "Now {{get that}} topsail {{up from the}} <b>sail</b> <b>locker.</b> We won't shift jibs just yet, until we see whether the breeze is going to freshen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Andrews, {{do you and}} {{two others}} get down into the <b>sail</b> <b>locker</b> and bring up the storm jib, the small foresail, trysail, and storm mizzen. If it is a tornado, we shan't want to show much sail to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{wondered}} what my double {{there in the}} <b>sail</b> <b>locker</b> thought of this commotion. He was able to hear everything--and perhaps {{he was able to}} understand why, on my conscience, it had to be thus close--no less. My first order [...] "Hard alee!" [...] re-echoed ominously under the towering shadow of Koh-ring as if I had shouted in a mountain gorge. And then I watched the land intently. In that smooth water and light wind it was impossible to feel the ship coming-to. No! I could not feel her. And my second self was making now ready to ship out and lower himself overboard. Perhaps he was gone already...? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{stand in}} {{as close as}} I dare and then put her round. I will {{presently}} find means to smuggle {{you out of here}} into the <b>sail</b> <b>locker,</b> which communicates with the lobby. But there is an opening, a sort of square for hauling the sails out, which gives straight on the quarter-deck and which is never closed in fine weather, so as to give air to the sails. When the ship's way is deadened in stays and all the hands are aft at the main braces you will have a clear road to slip out and get overboard through the open quarter-deck port. I've had them both fastened up. Use a rope's end to lower yourself into the water so as to avoid a splash--you know. It could be heard and cause some beastly complication." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very nice. Very comf..." [...] He didn't {{finish and}} went out brusquely as if to escape from some unrighteous wiles of mine. But {{it was not to}} be. I had been too frightened not to feel vengeful; I felt I had him on the run, and I meant to keep him on the run. My polite insistence must have had {{something}} menacing in it, because he gave in suddenly. And I did not let him off a single item; mate's room, pantry, storerooms, the very <b>sail</b> <b>locker</b> which was also under the poop--he had to look into them all. When at last I showed him out on the quarter-deck he drew a long, spiritless sigh, and mumbled dismally that he must really be going back to his ship now. I desired my mate, who had joined us, to see to the captain's boat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] I whispered, loudly, {{into the}} saloon--too loudly, perhaps, but I was afraid I couldn't make a sound. He was {{by my side}} in an instant--the double captain slipped past the stairs--through a tiny dark passage ... a sliding door. We were in the <b>sail</b> <b>locker,</b> {{scrambling}} on our knees over the sails. A sudden thought struck me. I saw myself wandering barefooted, bareheaded, the sun beating on my dark poll. I snatched off my floppy hat and tried hurriedly in the dark to ram it on my other self. He dodged and fended off silently. I wonder what he thought had come to me before he understood and suddenly desisted. Our hands met gropingly, lingered united in a steady, motionless clasp for a second. ... No word was breathed by either of us when they separated.|$|E
50|$|From the {{companionway}} {{the galley}} is immediately to starboard, while a chart table over a drawer stack is to port. A wall separates the aft {{end of the}} galley from the cockpit <b>sail</b> <b>locker.</b> The galley is separated on its forward side from the main cabin by a low wall. Aft of the chart table is a quarter berth. Forward of the chart table and galley are two settees; the port settee is able to unfold into a double sleeping berth. Forward is a hanging locker to the starboard side and a head to the port side. The mast passes through the cabin roof at the aft-most point of the head. At the most forward section of the main cabin is door to the v-berth, master stateroom. This sleeping area contains a second hanging locker, plus an anchor locker door at the narrow end of the v-berth. The head has a door, sink with storage underneath, shower, and toilet. The galley has a sink, refrigerator or icebox, and a combined stove/oven.|$|E
