40|$|SUMMARY: Turkey {{herpesvirus}} (HVT) {{was isolated}} from the kidneys of 6 of 8 turkey poults from two flocks. The isolates were identified by syncytial‐type of cytopathology, inhibition of plaque formation by 5 ‐bromodeoxyuridine, formation of Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusions in cell cultures, and presence of herpes‐type virions in negatively stained preparations and thin sections of infected cell cultures. One of these isolates inoculated into chickens proved apathogenic over an observation period of 10 weeks. Indirect immunofluorescence and <b>serum</b> <b>neutralisation</b> <b>tests</b> revealed serological relationship between these isolates and the strain NSW 1 / 70 of HVT.

40|$|Bovine viral {{diarrhoea}} virus (BVDV) is {{an important}} cattle pathogen that causes acute or persistent infections. These are associated with immunotolerance to the viral strain persisting in animals that became infected early in their intrauterine development. To this date, the epidemiology of BVD in Switzerland runs virtually undisturbed by control measures such as restrictions on animal traffic or vaccination. Here, we analysed the viral genetics of 169 Swiss isolates and carried out crossed <b>serum</b> <b>neutralisation</b> <b>tests</b> to assess the antigenic spectrum of BVDV strains present in the cattle population. Besides confirming the presence of BVDV type 1 subgroups b, e, h and k, a single "orphan" BVDV- 1 virus was detected that {{does not belong to}} any known BVDV- 1 subgroup. No BVDV type 2 viruses were detected, suggesting that they are rare or not present in the cattle population. Antigenic comparison revealed significant differences between the different subgroups, with anti- 1 k immune serum having up to tenfold lower neutralising activity against 1 b, 1 e and 1 h subgroup viruses, which however may still suffice to protect 1 k-immune animals against superinfection by viruses of those other subgroups. Serum from routinely vaccinated animals revealed generally low titres but good cross-neutralisation. A geographic information system revealed that the viruses of the different subgroups are distributed in an apparently randomised fashion in the cattle population. This geographic distribution pattern may reflect peculiarities of the management practice in the Swiss cattle industry that, especially through annual transhumance of up to 25 % of the entire population in the alpine region, tend to optimise the spread of BVDV...|$|R

40|$|A dot-ELISA {{test for}} the {{detection}} of anti-BRSV antibodies is described. The objective of this study was the standardisation of a test as a fast, inexpensive and effective alternative to detect anti-BRSV antibodies. Its sensitivity, specificity and usefulness were compared to a commercial ELISA-kit and to the standard <b>serum</b> <b>neutralisation</b> (SN) <b>test.</b> The standardisation of the technique was done using nitrocellulose disks soaked with a viral sample isolated in Brazil, BRSV- 25 -BR. The best results were obtained when the disks were sensitised with a purified antigen at a concentration of 0. 7 microg/disk and the bovine serum was diluted 1 : 200. The experiment used 423 samples of bovine serum collected in the main cattle breeding centres in Brazil. The standard SN, dot-ELISA technique and commercial ELISA kits scored 67. 8 %, 71. 8 % and 72. 3 % of the samples as positive, respectively. When compared to the SN test, the standardised dot-ELISA and the commercial ELISA tests presented relative sensitivities of 92. 3 % and 91. 6 % and relative specificities of 71. 3 % and 68. 4 % respectively. The results demonstrated that the dot-ELISA test is adequate for the objectives proposed by this study, being easy to use and economically viable. Thus, this test represents an alternative for BRSV serological diagnosis in the substitution of SN and commercial ELISA tests, recommendable for utilisation in laboratories with few resources...|$|R
40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay {{using the}} expressed protein sigma B as the coating antigen (sigma B-ELISA) for detecting antibody to avian reovirus (ARV) in chickens was developed and compared with a conventional ELISA. Both ELISAS and a <b>serum</b> <b>neutralisation</b> (SN) <b>test</b> were {{used to test the}} sera from experimentally vaccinated and farm chickens. The sigma B-ELISA could clearly distinguish the sn-positive and -negative sera in 38 -week-old chickens. The correlation rate between SN and a sigma B-ELISA was 100 per cent (65 / 65), and that between SN and conventional ELISA was 84 per cent (55 / 65). With the sigma B-ELISA, all SN-negative sera had low absorbance values (below 0. 06), and the absorbance values correlated closely with the SN titres. However, the sera which were antibody-negative by SN had various absorbance values, ranging from 0. 07 to 0. 39 in the conventional ELISA. Hence, the sigma B-ELISA had lower nonspecific binding reactions than the conventional ELISA against sera from ARV-negative birds. Antibody against ARV could be detected by a B-ELISA after vaccination. Absorbance values peaked 4 weeks after vaccination at 2 weeks of age and were maintained until the birds were 27 weeks old. The results suggest that the presence of antibody against viral protein sigma B in birds may be used as a good indicator by the sigma B-ELISA for detecting immune status of a chicken flock or to detect chickens infected with ARV.

40|$|Bluetongue (BT) is an arthropod-borne viral disease, which {{primarily}} affects ruminants in tropical and temperate {{regions of the}} world. Twenty six bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes have been recognised worldwide, including nine from Europe and fifteen in the United States. Identification of BTV serotype is important for vaccination programmes and for BTV epidemiology studies. Traditional typing methods (virus isolation and <b>serum</b> or virus <b>neutralisation</b> <b>tests</b> (SNT or VNT)) are slow (taking weeks, depend on availability of reference virus-strains or antisera) and can be inconclusive. Nucleotide sequence analyses and phylogenetic comparisons of genome segment 2 (Seg- 2) encoding BTV outer-capsid protein VP 2 (the primary determinant of virus serotype) were completed for reference strains of BTV- 1 to 26, as well as multiple additional isolates from different geographic and temporal origins. The resulting Seg- 2 database {{has been used to}} develop rapid (within 24 h) and reliable RT–PCR-based typing assays for each BTV type. Multiple primer-pairs (at least three designed for each serotype) were widely tested, providing an initial identification of serotype by amplification of a cDNA product of the expected size.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is a {{recently}} emerged virus of ruminants in Europe. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) {{are commonly used}} to detect SBV-specific antibodies in bulk tank milk samples to monitor herd exposure to infection. However, it has previously been shown that a bulk tank milk sample can test positive even though the majority of cows within the herd are seronegative for SBV antibodies. Development of a pen-side test to detect antibodies in individual milk samples would potentially provide a cheaper test (for which samples are obtained non-invasively) than testing individual serum samples by ELISA. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the agreement between antibody levels measured in milk and serum. RESULTS: Corresponding milk and serum samples from 88 cows in two dairy herds in the UK were tested for presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies to SBV using a commercially-available indirect ELISA.

AKAV infection can cause abortion, stillbirth, and congenital arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly in cattle and sheep. The distribution and prevalence of AKAV infection in China is still unknown. A total of 2731 sera collected from 2006 to 2015 in 24 provinces of China from cattle, sheep, goats and yak were examined by <b>serum</b> <b>neutralisation</b> <b>test.</b> The overall seroprevalence rates for AKAV antibodies were 21. 3 % in cattle (471 / 2215) and 12. 0 % (17 / 142) in sheep or goats, and 0 % in yak (0 / 374). The results indicated widespread AKAV infection in China among cattle and sheep but yak appear to have a low risk of infection. Using a selection of 50 AKAV-positive and 25 AKAV-negative cattle sera, neutralisation tests were also conducted to detect antibodies to several other Simbu serogroup bunyaviruses and closely related Leanyer virus.

After a quarantine period of four weeks, two lambs persistently infected with Border disease virus were introduced into a group of nine calves. The calves were negative for pestivirus-specific RNA and BDV and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) serum antibodies. All animals underwent a thorough clinical examination once daily throughout the study. Blood samples were taken for haematological analysis and detection of pestivirus-specific RNA and antibodies every one to two days for 73 days. In addition, nasal swabs were taken for the detection of pestivirus-specific RNA at the time of blood collection. Pestivirus-specific RNA could not be detected in blood samples or nasal swabs in the calves. However, seroconversion had occurred in six of the nine calves 72 days after introduction of the infected lambs.

The outbreak involved {{a total of}} 4 000 buffalo from 21 villages in which over 10 000 buffalo were herded. The outbreak also involved 125 humans who were mostly animal handlers and milkers of all age groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{describes}} {{the transmission of}} border disease virus (BDV) from a persistently infected calf to seronegative heifers in early pregnancy, resulting in persistently infected fetuses. On day 50 of pregnancy (= day 0 of the infection phase), six heifers were co-housed in a free stall with a bull calf persistently infected with BDV (pi BVD) for 60 days. The heifers underwent daily clinical examination, and blood samples were collected regularly for detection of pestiviral RNA and anti-pestivirus antibodies. After day 60 (= day 110 of pregnancy), the heifers were slaughtered, and the fetuses and placentae underwent post-mortem and immunohistochemical examination and RT-PCR for viral RNA detection. RESULTS: Three heifers had mild viraemia from day 8 to day 14, and by day 40 all heifers had pestivirus antibodies identified as anti-BDV antibodies in the <b>serum</b> <b>neutralisation</b> <b>test.</b> The placenta of the three viraemic heifers had histological evidence of inflammation, and fetal organs from these heifers were positive for pestivirus antigen by immunohistochemical examination and for BD viral RNA by RT-PCR and sequencing. Thus, co-housing of heifers in early pregnancy with a pi-BDV calf led to seroconversion in all heifers and persistent fetal infection in three. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that pi-BDV cattle can infect other cattle and lead to persistent infection of the fetus in pregnant cows, BDV should not be ignored {{in the context of}} the mandatory BVDV eradication and monitoring program. This strongly suggests that BDV should be taken into account in BVD eradication and control programs...|$|E
40|$|Background There {{is a lack}} of {{information}} concerning concurrent administration of vaccines against equine influenza virus (EIV) and equine herpesvirus 1 and 4 (EHV- 1 / 4). Objectives The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of the concurrent use of EIV and EHV- 1 / 4 vaccines in Thoroughbred racehorses on their humoral immune response to EIV. Methods This study was carried out on a population of 30 horses using an inactivated whole-virus EIV vaccine and an inactivated EHV- 1 / 4 vaccine. Horses were randomly allocated to vaccination group A or B. Horses in group A were vaccinated against EIV and EHV- 1 / 4 2 weeks apart. Horses in group B were vaccinated against EIV and EHV- 1 / 4 on the same day. Whole-blood samples were collected on the day of vaccination and 2 weeks and 6 weeks postvaccination. Antibody levels against EIV and EHV- 1 / 4 were measured using the single radial haemolysis and <b>serum</b> <b>neutralisation</b> <b>test,</b> respectively. Results The pattern of EIV antibody response post-vaccination was similar for both groups. Highest EIV antibody levels were recorded 2 weeks post-vaccination, and a significant decrease in antibody level was observed 4 weeks later. Horses in group B demonstrated a significantly higher EIV antibody response postvaccination. Overall, there was no significant difference in EHV- 1 / 4 antibody response between the two groups post-vaccination. Conclusion In this study, concurrent vaccination against EIV and EHV- 1 / 4 increased the response to EIV and did not compromise the humoral immune response to EHV- 1 / 4.

40|$|The woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi) is a {{critically}} endangered small Australian marsupial {{that is in}} a state of accelerated population decline for reasons that are currently unknown. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the involvement of several viral pathogens through strategic serological testing of several wild woylie populations. Testing for antibodies against the Wallal and Warrego serogroup of orbiviruses, Macropod herpesvirus 1 and Encephalomyocarditis virus in woylie sera was undertaken through virus <b>neutralisation</b> <b>tests.</b> Moreover, testing for antibodies against the the alphaviruses Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus and the flaviviruses Kunjin virus and Murray Valley encephalitis virus was undertaken through virus <b>neutralisation</b> <b>tests</b> and ELISA mainly because of the interest in the epidemiology of these important zoonoses as it was considered unlikely to be the cause of the decline. Between 15 and 86 samples were tested for each of the four sites in south-western Australia (Balban, Keninup, Warrup and Karakamia). Results indicated no exposure to any of the viral pathogens investigated, indicating that all populations are currently naïve and may be at risk if these pathogens were to be introduced...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of the}} {{neutralisation}} assay in the serotyping {{of unknown}} enterovirus isolates has been successfully applied for years since its description by Lim and Benyesh-Melnick 1. However, the procedure is labour-intensive and time consuming. In addition, the continuous depletion of the Benyesh-Melnick sera makes it prohibitive for most diagnostic laboratories to continue using the assay. Owing to these factors, a majority of laboratories only type for the polioviruses and report any other enterovirus isolate as “a nonpolio enterovirus”. With this approach, however, important findings such as the isolation of a new enterovirus or association of a known enterovirus with a new clinical syndrome will remain unidentified. In this study, a multiple-serum-pools approach similar to that described by Lim and Benyesh-Melnick 1 (LBM) for the <b>neutralisation</b> <b>test,</b> was applied in an immunofluorescence (IMF) test for the rapid serotyping of enteroviruses. This test was able to type any unknown enterovirus isolate belonging to the different enterovirus serotypes tested in this study, in about three hours {{as compared to the}} eight days currently taken by the LBM <b>neutralisation</b> <b>test</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{pseudoparticle}} virus <b>neutralisation</b> <b>test</b> (ppNT) and {{a conventional}} microneutralisation (MN) assay are specific for detecting antibodies to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) {{when used in}} seroepidemiological studies in animals. Genetically diverse MERS-CoV appear antigenically similar in MN tests. We confirm that MERS-CoV was circulating in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia in 1993. Preliminary data suggest that feral Australian dromedaries may be free of MERS-CoV but larger confirmatory studies are needed. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
