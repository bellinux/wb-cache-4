Owing to technical and logistical difficulties, thorough assessments of hydrodynamics in such experiments are not routinely made. In this study, we examined the suitability of two widely used systems to generate isotropic, homogeneous, and stationary turbulence in laboratory containers: oscillating grid devices with large stroke length and relatively low frequencies of oscillation and orbital <b>shaker</b> <b>tables.</b> Turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates were estimated from velocity measurements made with acoustic Doppler velocimeters. Both systems were shown to generate isotropic conditions in a relatively broad range of dissipation rates. Grid-stirred tanks produce homogeneous turbulence in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions, as long as stroke length {{is comparable to the}} height of the container. Turbulence in orbital shakers is not completely homogeneous, as it depends on the distance to the wall and to the surface. Empirical models are derived as a tool for the calculation of dissipation rates in the two systems within the ranges and conditions examined in this study...|$|R
40|$|In general, vehicle {{vibration}} is non-stationary {{and has a}} non-Gaussian probability distribution; yet existing {{testing methods}} for packaging design employ Gaussian distributions to represent vibration induced by road profiles. This frequently results in over-testing and/or over-design of the packaging to meet a specification and correspondingly leads to wasteful packaging and product waste, which represent $ 15 bn {{per year in the}} USA and € 3 bn per year in the EU. The purpose of the paper is to enable a measured non-stationary acceleration signal {{to be replaced by a}} constructed signal that includes as far as possible any non-stationary characteristics from the original signal. The constructed signal consists of a concatenation of decomposed shorter duration signals, each having its own kurtosis level. Wavelet analysis is used for the decomposition process into inner and outlier signal components. The constructed signal has a similar PSD to the original signal, without incurring excessive acceleration levels. This allows an improved and more representative simulated input signal to be generated that can be used on the current generation of <b>shaker</b> <b>tables.</b> The wavelet decomposition method is also demonstrated experimentally through two correlation studies. It is shown that significant improvements over current international standards for packaging testing are achievable; hence the potential for more efficient packaging system design is possible...|$|R

Owing to the demand for more comfortable compartments, seat cushions are now designed for better ride comfort, which {{is linked to the}} damping of seating foam. In this paper, PU polymer was mixed with short treated coir fibers (F) and recycled tires (P) to enhance damping and improve the vibrational characteristics of seating foam. Five samples with 2. 5 wt% filler loading were developed. The vibration characteristics of foam composites were examined by transmissibility tests generated at 1 and 1. 5 mm peak amplitude in the frequency range of 2 – 20 Hz, using a <b>shaker,</b> shaking <b>table,</b> and a foam-block system. The foam-block system was fabricated by simulating the seat/occupant system in an automobile. The damping properties of foam composites were calculated from the transmissibility data obtained. The results showed that more vibration was dissipated by the developed foam composites after the fillers were added. System inserts with PU+ 2. 5 wt%P gave the lowest resonance peak: 2. 460 and 2. 695 at 1 and 1. 5 mm base excitation, respectively, compared with 2. 788 and 2. 878 obtained from system inserts of pure PU foam. This is because a higher damping ratio (ξ foam) was found in PU+ 2. 5 wt%P, which is 36. 47 % and 19. 23 % higher than pure PU foam. In addition, other composites, such as PU+ 2. 5 wt%F, PU+ 2. 5 wt% (50 F 50 P), PU+ 2. 5 wt% (80 P 20 F), and 2. 5 wt% (80 F 20 P) also showed favorable vibration and damping characteristics in the experiments.

40|$|Finite element {{enforced}} response {{analysis was}} performed on a multiple degree of freedom expander head <b>shaker</b> <b>table</b> {{to aid in the}} design of the table structure and vibration control system. The payload for this shaker system is a spacecraft with a multitude of flexible modes across a broad frequency band. A Craig-Bampton representation of the spacecraft was used to expedite analysis of multiple <b>shaker</b> <b>table</b> designs. The analysis examines the required forces in the actuators for a constant amplitude base acceleration sine sweep test, the resulting forces in the spacecraft and table attachment restraints, and the resulting accelerations on the spacecraft structure. The results show the spacecraft response at low frequencies is very high near the tip due to the low order spacecraft bending and axial modes. The high response can be addressed by notching the input vibration levels to avoid overtesting the spacecraft. At frequencies above 25 Hz, the spacecraft modal effective masses are very small, and the response of the <b>shaker</b> <b>table</b> dominates the response. Anti-resonances of the <b>shaker</b> <b>table</b> in the frequency range of interest reduce the acceleration output and require much higher actuator forces to achieve the acceleration specification.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of dietary and supplemental calcium intake {{in relation to}} urinary stone disease is not well understood (1). For instance, why do most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism with markedly increased serum and urinary calcium not {{have a history of}} urinary stone disease? There must be other factors involved in stone formation. Calcium stone formers have traditionally been classified by their 24 -hour urine collections to be hypercalciuric (> 4 mg/kg), hyperuricosurics (> 600 mg for women;> 750 mg/ 24 h urine for men), hyperoxaluric (> 40 mg/ 24 h urine) and/or hypocitraturic (< 320 mg/ 24 h urine).

Calcium intake on the other hand is not well understood by many urologists, primary care physicians, and the lay press.

Consumer awareness and education is one of three primary strategies that have been identified by the World Health Organisation to achieve population-wide salt reduction. It involves the provision of salt reduction knowledge and the promotion of healthy salt related practices. These campaigns are a necessity in populations with high discretionary salt use such as South Africa. For these health promotion activities to succeed, they need to be developed with consideration of factors such as the environment, culture, and socio-economic standing of the intended target population. This two-phase health promotion study was conducted at St Mary’s Development and Care Centre and the Assumption Sisters Nutrition Centre. These are two community based organisations located in Grahamstown, South Africa. A needs assessment was conducted to identify the knowledge and practices of cooks and guardians from these centres on dietary salt reduction. The aim of {{the second phase of the}} study was to conduct an educational intervention and to develop a culturally appropriate and contextually specific health information intervention through a participatory process. Method: This was a qualitative study that was supported by elements of quantitative research [...] The first phase of the current study was a needs assessment. The first step involved an observational phase with cooks from the centres. The aim was to observe their discretionary salt use during food preparation and to document the salt content in the processed foods available at each centre. Semi-structured interviews were then conducted, with 3 cooks and 16 guardians 1 from the centres, to assess their knowledge and practices regarding salt reduction. Parents or the people responsible for the care of the children attending both centres. Guided by findings from the needs assessment phase, an educational intervention was developed. This phase involved the participatory development of three health information leaflets and a series of educational interactive sessions were conducted. Quantitative tests to assess the readability, suitability, and actionability were conducted on the leaflets. Qualitative assessment of the leaflets involved formative evaluations conducted by health care professionals, phase 1 participants, Rhodes University peer educators, an African languages and cultural expert, and a Rhodes University student wellness manager. This step was included to assess the content validity, context specificity, acceptability, and cultural appropriateness of the materials. Educational interactive sessions were guided by constructs of the Social Cognitive Theory and were conducted on three main topics: ‘Salt and my health’, ‘Reducing salt in my diet’, and ‘Reading food labels’. Results: The majority of the processed foods available at both centres contained low to medium levels of salt. Children at the centres were not provided with salt <b>shakers</b> on the <b>tables</b> during meal times. Cooks did not use measuring utensils when adding salt during meal preparation. Semistructured interviews revealed that participants lacked both declarative and procedural knowledge. In terms of declarative knowledge, they were unaware of the daily salt intake recommendations and the relationship between salt and sodium. Participants were able to identify hypertension as one of the health related consequences of high salt consumption. Most participants were responsible for purchasing groceries in their households. Their selfreported food label reading behaviours and inability to read food labels highlighted their lack of procedural knowledge. Most participants reported that they added salt during meal preparation and at mealtimes, highlighting high discretionary salt use. Some participants were also aware of cultural or religious uses of salt. The developed health information leaflets were considered to be written at a readability level appropriate for the target audience. The leaflets were also deemed to be actionable, culturally appropriate, and contextually specific and suitable materials. The educational interactive sessions were found to be interesting and informative. Conclusions: Findings from the needs assessment revealed the need for an educational intervention to address the identified gaps in the participants’ knowledge and practices regarding dietary salt reduction. The developed health information leaflets were found to be informative, culturally appropriate, and contextually specific, as planned. Interactive sessions provided an excellent platform to supply participants with concise and accurate information, increasing the possibility of improving their salt reduction related knowledge...|$|R
