The maximum characteristics of seed bearing were proper for clones of trees at the age of 170 – 195 with a large number of the previous year sprouts and the average annual growth in the range of 0. 12 – 0. 15 m in height and 0. 24 – 0. 29 cm in diameter. The trees over 200 years have weak vitality grafts. That’s why the age of Korean pine seed productivity breeding should be limited by this age. The coefficients of variation of the clone seed bearing characteristics amount to 35 – 56 % during the first decade, later – up to 154 %. The variability of the whole population is the same. Sometimes, the Rate of Relative Total Seed Productivity (RRTSP) differs ten or more times in two trees of one clone, while the best clones exceed the worst ones 2 – 6 times. As consistent with a single-factor analysis of variance, clone differences in the numbers of cones are not significant for P = 0. 05.

The paper {{analyses}} {{the genetic}} {{structure of the}} pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) clones in the multiclone seed plantations of Kozji Grm (KG) and Šamin Gaj (ŠG). The clones in both seed plantations originate from natural populations of common pine in Bosnia and Hercegovina; KG (40 clones) : Gornji Janj – 10 clones, Klekovača 7, Kaljina Bioštica 16, Romanija Glasinac 6, Igman 1, while the ŠG plantation contains 20 clones from one population (Igman). The genetic structure was analysed using 9 enzyme systems upon altogether 12 gene loci. Altogether 55 different alleles were observed: in KG plantation 45 alleles were seen, while in ŠG plantation there were 35 alleles. To estimate the genetic diversity, {{the mean number of}} alleles per locus (A/L) was calculated: it is 3. 83 for KG, and 2. 91 for ŠG, while the mean number of genotypes per locus (G/L) was 5. 16 for KG and 3. 58 for ŠG. The results confirm the assumption that the number of possible classes with genotypes is higher than with alleles. The differences are the most conspicuous if the differences are observed in the occurrence of the individual alleles and the allele frequencies. The mean real hetero-zygote property of the clones in KG plantation is 0. 2833, while the same value in ŠG is 0. 3166.

40|$|Introduction: Plants {{are usually}} exposed to {{different}} environmental stresses which limit their growth and productivity {{as well as}} cause considerable loss of worldwide agricultural production. One {{of the most important}} factors affecting plant and production of secondary metabolites is the salt stress. Salinity of soil or water is one of major stress, obstacles to increase production in plant growing areas throughout the world and especially in arid and semi-arid regions it can severely limit plant production. Iran is among the world's arid and semi-arid land, and faces water resources shortage and saline lands. According to the concept of sustainable development and role of Agriculture, using saline water and soil resources seems mandatory. Recently, medicinal and aromatic plants have received much attention in several fields such as agroalimentary, perfumes, pharmaceutical industries and natural cosmetic products. Although, secondary metabolites in the medicinal and aromatic plants were fundamentally produced by genetic processing, but, their biosynthesis are strongly influenced by environmental factors. It means that biotic and abiotic environmental factors affect growth parameter, essential oil yield and constituents. Abiotic environmental stresses, especially salinity and drought have the most effect on medicinal plant. Medicinal plants cultivation is one of ways to exploit these resources. Essential oils help to easier adapt to the environmental stress conditions. Also, essential oils are not constantly in the quantitative and qualitative terms. They are changing continuously, due to the requirements of the environment, and to individual survival. The different results were dedicated from the effect of salinity stress on the quantitative and qualitative parameters. Lavender (Lavandula angustifulia Miller) is a perennial woody medicinal plant that cultivated for its an essential oil in leafs and flowers. Major parts of Lavender produces essential oil are flowers and leaves. Materials and Methods: This experiment was carried out using a randomized complete block design with three replications to study the effect of salinity stress on growth parameters, essential oil constituents and yield of Lavender (Lavandula angustifulia) at the Horticultural Sciences Department, Plant Product faculty, Gorgan Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University. Lavender plants were obtained from <b>seed</b> <b>plantation.</b> The seeds in this investigation were obtained from the Institution of Forests and Range researches in Tehran. After three weeks stratification (4 ºC) and germination, five plants were transplanted into similarized pots that were filled with perlite and cocopeat (2 : 1). Irrigation treatments with hydroponic solution were completed during germination until stage of 6 - 8 leaf. Then, five levels of salt stress, including 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mM NaCl levels were investigated during four months, applied in hydroponic. Length, shoot wet weight, root wet weight and root dry weight were measured at full flowering stage (after five months). The same time in order to evaluate percentage and composition essential oil, each plant were harvested and dried under room condition. After two weeks, Clevenger method was used to extract the essential oil from the plant foliage. The obtained essential oil were measured for calculating of essential oils percentage and then, analyzed by using GC/MS (Gas choromatography-mass spectrometry) for identification and quantification of the components. Statistical analysis of data was used with SAS software and charts preparing was done with Excel software. Mean comparison with LSD’s test in 5 percent probability was used. Results and Discussion: Results indicated that salinity stress motivated a significant influence in all of the growth parameters and essential oil yield and percent in P < 0. 05. Increasing salt of the soil led to reduce in stem length, shoot wet weight, root wet weight and root dry weight and increase length of root and leaf essential oil percent at first, and then led to reduce these two parameters. The highest values of the essential oil percent were obtained from second level of salinity. Also, it was reported that salt stress had a significant effect on yield and percent of essential oil that was similar to our finding. This was reported that percent of essential oil in each plant and composition of essential oil changed. According to the results of this research, salinity treatment significantly increased essential oil percentage in Lavandula angustifulia. Conclusion: The most important of leaf essential oil component is Borneol that was increased. So, the medium level of salinity stress caused to increase in percent and quality of lavender essential oil...|$|E

To determine the genetic affinities of this provenance, 154 trees from three subspecies and the Jeeralang provenance were sampled. Analysis of 12 morphological characters verified that the Jeeralang provenance is intermediate between subspecies bicostata (Maiden, Blakely, & J. Simm.) Kirkpatr., globulus and pseudoglobulus (Naudin ex Maiden) Kirkpatr., with individuals having closest affinities to either ssp. globulus or ssp. bicostata. However, eight microsatellite loci showed that the Jeeralang provenance has greater affinities to Victorian ssp. globulus to which it is geographically closest. In contrast, Tasmanian and Victorian ssp. globulus are morphologically similar yet appear to be distinct at the molecular level. This study emphasizes the importance of using traits that are unlikely to be influenced by selection when determining the origin and affinities of populations...|$|R
30|$|Most of the {{provenance}} and intra-provenance {{variation in}} germination capacity, growth and seedling survival of N. glauca {{is explained by}} the intra-provenance variability associated with mother effects other than seed mass or site conditions. These results indicate plasticity within the species and the potential capacity to adapt to climate change. We advocate that this high intra-provenance variation must be adequately managed. Pre-Andean seedlings must be established in high-elevation environments, while coastal provenances must be restricted to more lowland and coastal environments. These results, although recorded for nursery seedlings, emphasise the importance of field trials. The use of locally adapted <b>seeds</b> in large-scale <b>plantations</b> will minimise the risk of planting maladapted trees and will avoid indiscriminate mixing of provenances from different ecological regions.|$|R

Establishment of seed source of merbau is essential tosupply qualified <b>seeds</b> for <b>plantation.</b> Center for Forest Biotechnology and Tree Improvement has established provenance test of merbau at Sumberwringin Research Forest in Bondowoso, East Java. The objectives {{of this study are}} to know survival and genetic variation of growth traits in provenance test plot of merbau. This provenance test was designed as Randomized Complete Block Design with single factor of provenance consisted of Halmahera Timur, Waigo, Oransbari, Wasior, Nabire and Seram. Each provenance comprises 3 blocks as replication and 60 treeplots of each block. The result showed high survival rate of all provenances (above 90 %). Moreover, genetic variation of height and stem diameter among provenances was also high. The best provenance for survival, and height for all observation years was Wasior. The best provenance for diameter for all observation years was Halmahera Timur. Meanwhile, provenance having the best value of survival, height and diameter for all observation years was Halmahera Timur. The provenance having the worst value of height and diameter for all observation years was Seram. Whereas, the worst provenance of survival at 1, 2 and 3 years old were Waigo, Halmahera Timur dan Seram, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abandoned {{plantations}} of coffee, tea {{and other}} commercial crops offer opportunities for understanding ecological processes in modified forest ecosystems. Unlike tree plantations tea is maintained as a shrub with a continuous dense short canopy that precludes large-frugivore activity thereby limiting dispersal of forest species to such areas. In {{this study we}} determine how location and density of Grevillea robusta a shade tree in tea plantations and proximity of plantations to forests influences seed arrival from forests into the plantations. We also estimate the importance of dispersal modes in the colonization processes. We laid 10 × 10 -m plots at three distance intervals from the forest edge in three different plantation types with varying shade tree densities. Within the plots we laid four 1 × 1 -m subplots {{at the corners of}} the plot. We estimated species richness, abundance and categorized the seeds into dispersal modes in these plots. Grevillea robusta increased species richness of seeds by three times and abundance of seeds by 3 – 30 times compared with plantations without them. Higher density of G. robusta increased seed input changed species composition and altered species dominance in the plantations. Distance to forests influenced <b>seed</b> arrival in <b>plantations</b> without G. robusta trees and plots 95 m from the forest did not have any seeds in them. No such effect was seen in plantations with G. robusta trees. Seeds dispersed by birds or a combination of birds and mammals contribute 30 % of the <b>seeds</b> reaching the <b>plantations</b> with G. robusta and this was not influenced by distance from the forest. In plantations without G. robusta bird dispersal is restricted to 25 m from the forest edge. In general density of shade trees has a strong influence on seed arrival which can negate the forest proximity effect and enhance natural forest colonization...|$|R
40|$|Tree {{plantations}} consisting {{mostly of}} a single exotic species have been established in Hong Kong, South China, for reforesting degraded lands since the 1950 s. In this study, natural woody plant regeneration success under different types of closed-canopy plantations (Acacia confusa, Lophostemon confertus, Melaleuca quinquenervia and mixed-plantings) and natural secondary forests in the central New Territories were assessed. A total of 79 tree species, 64 shrubs and 23 woody climbers were recorded in 16 20 m × 20 m plantation plots. Stem density of woody plant regeneration was similar among all sites, ranging from 9031 to 10, 950 stems > 0. 5 m in height per hectare. Multivariate analysis of understorey species composition showed that there were consistent differences between plantation types. Lophostemon plantations generally had poor native plant colonization in comparison with natural secondary forests {{and other types of}} plantations. These differences between forest types can be at least partly attributed to pre-existing site conditions, since the tree species planted were matched to the site. Native woody plant colonization was poor on sites isolated from natural <b>seed</b> sources. <b>Plantation</b> understories were generally dominated by a few species of bird-dispersed shrubs, suggesting that enrichment planting with poorly dispersed shade-tolerant native tree species will be needed to facilitate regeneration in those plantations where natural regeneration is inadequate. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|Teak (Tectona grandis) {{is one of}} {{the main}} timber species in the world with high {{economic}} value, famous for its beauty, strength and durability. The objective of this work was to characterize the genetic diversity of teak genotypes used in Brazilian plantations. Nine microsatellite primers were used to assess 60 teak genotypes, including 33 genotypes from <b>seeds</b> of <b>plantations</b> and 14 clones from Cáceres municipality, Mato Grosso State, Brazil, and 13 clones from Honduras, Malaysia, India, Indonesia, Ivory Coast and Solomon Islands. Two groups of genotypes were detected using the Bayesian Structure analysis: 80 % were placed in group 1, represented by genotypes from Cáceres and one from Malaysia, and 20 % allocated in group 2, composed of clones from India, Solomon Islands, Malaysia and Honduras and the clones from the Ivory Coast. Most of the genetic variability (73 %) was concentrated within groups according to AMOVA analysis. Genetic parameters were estimated for the two groups obtained in the analysis of Structure. Moderate genetic diversity was found, with 4. 1 alleles per locus, on average, and an average heterozygosity of 0. 329, which was lower than the expected heterozygosity (He = 0. 492). Group 1 showed the lowest values for these parameters. Suggestions were made concerning the identification of contrasting genotypes to be used as parents in breeding programs...|$|R
40|$|Priznatim izoenzimskim biljezima, izvršili smo molekularno genetičku identifikaciju dijela prirodnih populacija smreke u Dinaridima, na širem području Bosne i Hercegovine. Uporabom izoenzimskih biljega analizirali smo 13 populacija smreke (Picea abies Karst.), dok smo varijabilnost analizirali uporabom 13 enzimski sustava, te proveli analize na 20 polimorfnih lokusa, sa 73 alela. Prosječan broj alela po lokusu kretao se od 1, 80 do 2, 60. Analizom smo utvrdili postojanje velike varijabilnosti unutar populacija, te za gen lokus GOT – C postojanje klinalne varijabilnosti. Genetički multilokusni diverzitet iznosio je od 27, 5 do 37, 0, a gen pool diverzitet od 1, 277 do 1, 380. Provedeno istraživanje pokazalo je da populacija Vlašić ne pripada autohtonim, prirodnim populacijama smreke u Bosni i Hercegovini. Dobivena srednja alelna udaljenost između analiziranih populacija kretala se od 0, 18 % do 2, 06 %, te postoji povezanost između genetičkih i zemljopisnih udaljenosti, s izuzetkom populacije Vlašić. In {{this study}} we have carried out the {{molecular}} genetic identification of a part of natural populations of spruce in Central Dinaric Alps, in a broader area of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the approve isoenzyme markers. By usage of 13 enzyme systems we studied the genetic variability {{at the level of}} biochemical markers. In the studied populations we obtained high values of heterozygosis which proves that the studied populations, over the adaptation period in diverse ecological circumstances, have not lost much of their adaptability. Therefore, the populations from this area showed better adaptability than the populations from central European area, since they possess higher genetic variability, {{with the exception of the}} population of Vlašić, which by its genetic structure shows it does not belong to the autochthonous genetic resources of spruce from Bosnia and Herzegovina. We carried out the analysis at 20 polymorphous loci, with 73 allele, and we obtained an average number of analyzed allele per locus, which varied between 1, 80 and 2, 60. The analysis thus confirmed the existence of major variability within populations, and for gene locus GOT – C the existence of clinal variability. The genetic multi-loci diversity varied between 27, 5 and 37, 0, and the gene pool diversity from 1, 277 to 1, 380, while a mean allele distance varied from 0, 18 % to 2, 06 %, thus confirming that there exists the relationship between genetic and geographic distances between the studied populations, with the exception of Vlašić. In order to preserve the natural genetic resources of spruce in Bosnia and Herzegovina it would be necessary to establish a dense network of gene banks in situ and ex situ (seed systems, seed zones and <b>seed</b> <b>plantations),</b> necessary to preserve the genetic diversity within populations. Based on the studies that were carried out, it would mean that each significant ecological niche for spruce should have its gene bank with corresponding number of units, in order to preserve ecological and physiological identity of the populations. In management of natural spruce forests, and their renovation, an advantage should, however, be given to their natural renewal, with constant monitoring of the genetic structure, which would enable us to undertake timely measures in preservation of optimal natural genetic diversity which is typical for each population...|$|R

This provenance {{is used as}} seed sources for forest rehabilitation {{in the area of}} development. Eleven provenances of suren from Sumatera Island was established in Candiroto, Temanggung, Central Java. The plot was designed in a Randomized Completely Block Design (RCBD) comprised of three replicates, 11 provenances and 9 trees per plot with spacing of 3 m x 3 m. This study showed that tree height, diameter and volume were significant different among provenances at 4 and 5 years age, while significant for survival at 5 years age. Tree height, diameter and volume showed significant and positive correlation with each other. Broad sense heritability value were found fairly good for all traits.
