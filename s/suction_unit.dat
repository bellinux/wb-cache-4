40|$|With {{the aid of}} {{the optical}} sensor system, the user is able to monitor the draping process online or to {{evaluate}} it using stored data. Using these data, it was demonstrated that the draping behavior of consolidated and non-consolidated fabrics differed from each other. The consolidated fabric reacts similarly to a non-drapable material because the stresses are horizon-tally and vertically degraded rather than along the fiber direction, as occurs with the non-consolidated fabric. Due to the gliding direction along the fibers, the latter material behaves as pre-dicted in theory. This provides us with the predictability of the draping behavior. Also, the data suggest the higher drapability, which is unambiguous given because of the low shear strength. On the basis of this fact, the non-consolidated fabric should be used in subsequent test runs. The data additionally show that the draping processes differ from one test run to another despite the identical process configuration. The non-consolidated fabric has on average the lowest gliding be-havior, but the larger variation over all six test runs. This suggests that during the draping process, particularly the easily drapable materials have different effects which cannot be foreseen. In the following studies, the sensor data should be used to optimize the draping quality in the sense of deviation from the real to theoretically determined fiber angles and wrinkle formation of the cut-piece positioned in the tooling. For this purpose, a large number of test runs have to be carried out in which the suction intensity of the <b>suction</b> <b>units</b> will be varied and this configuration will be eval-uated by means of the fiber angle and boundary curve sensor data. The goal will be to develop an optimal draping strategy, which can be documented on the one hand {{with the help of the}} sensory data and on the other hand it can help to counteract draping deviations of the actual to the optimal gliding behavior. For this, it will be necessary to intervene online in the draping process. For such an active draping mechanism, a control system must be developed which is capable of influencing the holding forces of the <b>suction</b> <b>units</b> by varying the volumetric flow. If the system now detects an actual sliding vector deviating from the target, the system can intervene. It can reinforce the holding force in the area correspondingly if a deviating gliding behavior has taken place or reduce the holding force if it prevents a required gliding...|$|R

Eight had chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH), 23 chronic active hepatitis (CAH), and 4 cirrhosis. A total of 328 samples collected from instruments and surfaces were tested after dental treatment of 35 anti-HCV positive patients.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess of pathogenic organisms of the water used in the dentistry units of Yasuj city. Methods: In this research 120 samples of water from poir and turbine of units (before and after flushing) and two samples of urban water were collected. Sampling was performed on the first weekday (48 hours after the units were switched off) and mid week(16 hours after the units were switched off) before starting work. The samples were cultured on EMB Agar and Blood Agar and incubated at 37 oC for purification for Gram positive or Gram negative bacteria and it was identifying with biochemical diagnostic test. Also the samples were counted by standard plate count. Results: The average count of bacteria before flushing in Poir on the first weekday was 5360 CFU/L and turbine was 2800 CFU/L and count of bacteria after flushing in Poir on the first weekday was 1040 CFU/L and turbine was 1020 CFU/L. While this result for midweek day : The average count of bacteria before flushing in Poir was 3220 CFU/L and turbine was 2720 CFU/L and count of bacteria after flushing in Poir was 1772 CFU/L and turbine was 980 CFU/L.

40|$|Due to {{the mostly}} lower {{stiffness}} and greater poissons {{ratio of the}} mortar, units and bed joint mortar in centrically loaded masonry are in a triaxial stress state. The units are subjected to compressive stresses in the vertical direction and to tensile stresses in both horizontal directions whereas the bed joint mortar is exposed to triaxial compressive stresses. The strength and deformation properties of both masonry components under these stress states are largely unkown. While german masonry design codes are mostly based on results of tests on masonry structures such as walls or columns, a calculation of masonry structures, when using the finite element method, requires {{the knowledge of the}} basic material properties of mortar and units. By means of a new developed test equipment 184 triaxial compression tests were carried out on mortar specimens that were taken from bed joints and therefore represent the influence of <b>unit</b> <b>suction.</b> Two normal- and two lightweight mortars were used in combination with three different unit types for the preparation of mortar specimens.

40|$|With {{frequent}} heavy rainfalls {{in summer}} in Poland and fast-melting snow in spring leading to flooding of sewage systems (due to excessive filling levels in water receivers or difficulties with temporary retention of the excess stormwater), {{a variety of}} systems are being developed to facilitate transfer of the stormwater to water receivers. Outflow of the excess stormwater is usually ensured {{by the use of}} gravitational outflow collectors that connect stormwater drains with waterways. The transfer occurs during intensive precipitation, when the excess wastewater overflows through stormwater drains and is transferred directly to water receivers in order to relieve wastewater treatment plants or to minimize diameters of sewers. These systems are useful wherever the filling levels in waterways are not very high or the sewerage system is located relatively high with respect to the water receiver i. e. outflow collector is located on a steep slope. In such cases, the stormwater that flows through a waterway cannot be returned to the outflow collector. If the gravitational flow is impossible e. g. due to the excessive filling level of water receiver, stormwater can be transferred by means of a variety of modern solutions, such as retention and transfer reservoirs. These reservoirs are supposed to ensure partial retention of the excess stormwater and transfer of this water to water receivers, either gravitationally or forced mechanically, depending on the filling level in the waterway. Furthermore, these reservoirs prevent wastewater from being returned to the system during suddenly rising levels. One of the solutions is offered by the reservoir presented in this paper. The transfer reservoir for the stormwater presented in this paper might be successfully used in modernization of current sewage systems, ensuring the reliability of operation and a more effective wastewater transfer than the systems used to date. All the reservoirs of this type are characterized by similar design and function and guarantee that the wastewater might be transferred regardless of the conditions in the water receiver.
