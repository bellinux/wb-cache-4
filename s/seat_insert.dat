40|$|The {{researches}} {{have been}} carried out, where the object has been the set of two friction couples: valve stem – valve guide and valve seat – <b>seat</b> <b>insert.</b> The camless driven valve has been common for each of such cases. The analyzed valve {{has been driven by}} magnetoelectrical drive. The special research stand has been elaborated and its scheme has been presented in the article. It has been measured the valve lift and valve acceleration, the impact force, the friction force, temperature values for valve guide and for <b>seat</b> <b>insert,</b> sound level during impacting on the stand. The aim of researches has been to determine the dynamic parameters, the friction force between valve stem and valve guide, the impact force for valve impacting <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> vs. frequency and valve lift. The analyzed valves have mated with seat inserts and valve guides made of cast iron, in oil absence. The valves have been made of TiAl 6 Zr 4 Sn 2 Mo 2 alloy. The researched friction couples have operated in temperature equal 293 K. The increase of frequency has resulted in small changes for values of lift and in greater changes of acceleration, during valve impact into its <b>seat</b> <b>insert.</b> The greatest values of impact force and acceleration have been for the small, middle and high values of valve lift, either. The ratio of impact force and valve acceleration has changed in thin bands. The friction force has decreased slightly with frequency increase and has decreased with valve lift increase. The sound level has increased with the frequency increase, and has not been dependent upon valve lift...|$|E
40|$|Valve {{seat inserts}} {{are one of}} the vital part of the valve train in {{internal}} combustion engines, as they are the interface between the valve and the cylinder head. Valve and valve seat embeds together serve to seal off the combustion chamber regulating the inlet and exhaust gases. The valve <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> avoids immediate contact of the valve with the cylinder head and absorbs part of the combustion heat which is transfered to the valve by passing it on to the cylinder head. Therefore, misalignment of the valve seat during manufacturing could result in engine failure. This project proposes a valve <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> misalignment measurement using the concept of eddy current inspection method. Eddy current inspection method permit flaw detection in a large variety of conductive materials, either ferromagnetic or non-ferromagnetic. Simulation to study the change in induced current density and magnetic density around the valve seat and cylinder head due to the magnetic field generated by an exciting coil was conduct using COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 4. Based on the simulation result, it is observed that the change in gap width between valve seat and cylinder head will interfere the eddy current path which caused in the change of induced current density and magnetic flux density...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Under actual engine driving conditions, {{there is}} a {{possibility}} of engine valve and <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> wear occurring as a result of various speed changes and accumulation of mileage. It is therefore necessary to examine the wear-related problems of engine valves and seat inserts and to determine by comparison whether speed or mileage inflicts the greater wear. This work focuses on the various degrees of wear produced at three different singular test speeds (10 Hz, 25 Hz, and multi-Hz) and two different cycle numbers (2. 1 × 106 and 6. 0 × 106). Throughout all tests performed in this study, the temperature of the outer surface of the <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> was controlled at 350 °C and the test load was 1960 N. Wear depths were measured using a confocal laser microscope, and wear mechanisms were observed using a scanning electron microscope. The extent of wear produced at higher speeds (25 Hz) was found to be greater than that produced at lower speeds (10 Hz) under identical test conditions (temperature, valve displace-ment, cycle number, and test load). Although test cycle numbers were increased by a factor of 3, for example from 2. 1 × 106 to 6. 0 × 106, the wear depths were not proportionally increased. Wear occurred rapidly during the initial stages of the test and wear depths increased les...|$|E

40|$|Controlling the {{temperature}} of the exhaust valves is paramount for proper functioning of engines and for the long lifespan of valve train components. The majority of the heat outflow from the valve takes place along the valve-seat-cylinder head-coolant thermal path which is significantly influenced by the thermal contact resistance (TCR) present at the valve/seat and seat/head interfaces. A test rig facility and experimental procedure were successfully developed to assess the effect of the valve/seat and seat/head interfaces on heat outflow from the valve, in particular the effects of the valve/seat interface geometry, <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> assembly method, i. e. press or shrink fit, and <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> metallic coating on the operating temperature of the valve. The results of tests have shown that the degree of the valve-seat geometric conformity is more significant than the thermal conductivity of the insert: for low conforming assemblies, the mean valve head temperature recorded during tests on copper-infiltrated insert seats was higher than that recorded during tests on noninfiltrated seats of higher conformance. The effect of the insert-cylinder head assembly method, i. e. shrink-fitted versus press-fitted inserts, has proved negligible: results have shown insignificant valve head temperature variations, for both tin-coated and uncoated inserts. On the other hand, coating the seat inserts with a layer of tin (20 - 22 ¿m) reduced the mean valve head temperature by approximately 15 °C as measured during tests on uncoated seats. The analysis of the valve/seat and seat/head interfaces has indicated that the surface asperities of the softer metal in contact would undergo plastic deformation. Suitable thermal contact conductance (TCC) models, available in the public domain, were used to evaluate the conductance for the valve/seat and seat/cylinder head interfaces. Finally, a FE thermal model of the test rig has been developed with a view to assess the quality of the calculated TCC values for the valve/seat and seat/head interfaces. The results of the thermal analysis have shown that predicted temperatures at chosen control points agree with those measured during tests on thermometric seats with an acceptable level of accuracy, proving the effectiveness of the used TCC models.

40|$|INTRODUCTION] Valve {{recession}} {{occurs when}} wear of the valve or seat inserts in an automotive engine {{has caused the}} valve to sink or recede into the <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> (as shown in Figure 1). Excessive recession leads to valves not seating correctly and cylinder pressure loss. Leaking hot combustion gases can also cause valve guttering or torching, which will accelerate valve failure. Although new valve materials and production techniques are constantly being developed, these advances have been outpaced by demands for increased engine performance and wear related problems remain an issue. Dynamometer engine testing {{is often used to}} establish short-term solutions. This is time consuming and does not necessarily reveal the actual causes of wear. A long-term approach is required in order to understand fundamental wear mechanisms and the effect of varying engine operating conditions or design changes to the valve train. This information can then be used to develop tools for predicting wear and for solving problems more quickly if they do occur. In this case study, such tools were developed using a combination of component failure analysis, bench test work and wear modelling...|$|E
40|$|Valve wear {{has been}} a serious problem to engine {{designers}} and manufacturers for many years. Although new valve materials and production techniques are constantly being developed, these advances have been outpaced by demands for increased engine performance. The drive for reduced oil consumption and exhaust emissions, the phasing out of leaded petrol, reductions in the sulphur content of diesel fuel {{and the introduction of}} alternative fuels such as gas all have implications for valve and <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> wear. The aim of the project has been, {{through the use of a}} representative bench test and engine testing, to diagnose the predominant wear mechanisms in diesel engine inlet valves and seats. This information was then to be used with other test data to develop a model for predicting valve recession and other tools to assist in solving valve failure problems. Test apparatus has been developed that is capable of providing a simulation of the wear of both inlet valves and seats used in automotive diesel engines. Investigations carried out using the apparatus have shown that the valve and seat wear problem involves two distinct mechanisms; impact of the valve on the <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> on valve closure and sliding of the valve on the seat under the action of the combustion pressure. Wear has been shown to increase with valve closing velocity, combustion load and misalignment of the valve relative to the seat. Lubrication of the valve/seat interface leads to a significant reduction in valve recession. Valve rotation ensures even wear and promotes debris removal from the valve/seat interface. During testing it was established that resistance to impact was the key seat material property determining the amount of recession that occurred. A semi-empirical wear model for predicting valve recession has been developed based on the fundamental mechanisms of wear determined during test work. Model predictions were compared with engine tests and tests run on the bench test-rig. The model can be used to give a quantitative prediction of the valve recession to be expected with a particular material pair or a qualitative assessment of how parameters need to be altered in order to reduce recession. Flow charts have also been developed, based on the review of literature, failure analysis and modelling carried out, to assist in diagnosing and rectifying valve/seat failures and to help in reducing valve recession by design. The test apparatus, valve recession model and design tools can be integrated into an industrial environment in order to help reduce costs and timescales involved in solving valve/seat wear problems using the current trial and error methods...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{demands on}} engine {{performance}} and cost reductions have meant that advances made in materials and production technology are often outpaced This frequently results in wear problems occurring with engine components. Few models exist for predicting wear, and consequently each wear problem {{has to be}} investigated, the cause isolated and remedial action taken. The objective of this work was to carry out experimental studies to investigate valve and <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> wear mechanisms and use the test results to develop a recession prediction tool to assess the potential for valve recession and solve problems that occur more quickly. Experimental apparatus has been developed {{that is capable of}} providing a valid simulation of the wear of diesel automotive inlet valves and seats. Test methodologies developed have isolated the effects of impact and sliding. A semi-empirical wear model for predicting valve recession has been developed based on data gathered during the bench testing. A software program, RECESS, was developed to run the model. Model predictions are compared with engine dynamometer tests and bench tests. The model can be used to give a quantitative prediction of the valve recession to be expected with a particular material pair or a qualitative assessment of how parameters need to be altered in order to reduce recession.

40|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines {{it is important}} to manage the wear in the valve and valve seat contact in order to minimise emissions and maximise economy. Traditionally wear in this contact has been controlled by the use of a valve <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> and the careful selection of materials for both the valve and the insert. More recently, due to the increasing demands for both performance and cost, alternative methods of controlling the wear, and the resulting valve recession, have been sought. Using the heating effect of a laser to induce localised phase transformations, to increase hardness and wear resistance, in materials has been used since the 1970 s, however it is only in recent years that it has been able to compete with more established surface treatment techniques, particularly in terms of cost, as new laser hardware has been developed. In this work, a laser has been used to treat the valve seat area of a cast iron cylinder head. In order to optimise the laser parameters for use on the head, preliminary tests were carried out to investigate the fundamental wear characteristics of untreated cast iron and also cast iron with a range of laser treatments. Previous work has identified the predominant wear mechanism in the valve and valve seat contact as impact on valve closure. Two bespoke test machines, one for testing basic specimens and one for testing components, were used to identify the laser parameters most likely to yield acceptable results when applied to a cylinder head to be used in a fired dynamometer test.

40|$|The {{exhaust valve}} system of {{combustion}} engines experiences {{a very complex}} contact situation of frequent impact involving micro sliding, high and varying temperatures, complex exhaust gas chemistry and possible particulates, etc. In addition, the tribological situation in the exhaust valve system is expected to become even worse due to strict future emission regulations, which will require enhanced combustion and cleaner fuels. This will substantially reduce the formation of combustion products that might ease the contact conditions by forming tribofilms on the contacting surfaces. The lack of protective films is expected to result in increased wear of the contact surfaces. The aim of the work presented in this thesis has been to increase the tribological understanding of the valves. The wear {{that takes place in}} the valve sealing interface and how the change in operating conditions affects it have been studied. Such understanding will facilitate the development of future valve designs. A test rig has been developed. It has a unique design with the ability to insert ppm amounts of media into a hot air flow, in order to simulate different environmental changes, e. g. varying amount and composition of combustion residue particles. PVD coated valves were evaluated in a dry atmosphere. It was concluded that although some of the coatings showed potential, the substrate could not support the thin, hard coatings. Investigations with an addition of different oils have been performed. Fully formulated oils proved to build up a protective oil residue tribofilm. This tribofilm has been in-depth analysed and proved to have similar composition and appearance as tribofilms found on low wear field tested valves. With a non-additivated oil, wear particles from the valve <b>seat</b> <b>insert</b> formed a wear particle tribofilm on top of the valve sealing surface. Without any oil the surfaces showed severe wear with wear particles spread over the surfaces. The results presented give a hint about what to be expected in the future, when the engine oils are replaced with ash less oils with reduced amount of additives and the consumed amount of oil within the cylinders are reduced. ...|$|E
