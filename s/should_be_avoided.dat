5|$|Like other soluble fluorides, CsF is {{moderately}} toxic. Contact with acid <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided,</b> as this forms highly toxic/corrosive hydrofluoric acid. The caesium ion (Cs+) and caesium chloride {{are generally}} not considered toxic.|$|E

Many varnishes and paints are well known emitters of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), {{some of which may}} be acidic, and thus have the potential to damage calcium carbonate specimens. Because of this, these coatings should also be avoided; water-based varnishes and paints are considered less harmful, and should be preferred.|$|E

5|$|When welding {{dissimilar}} metals, {{the joint}} {{must have an}} accurate fit, with proper gap dimensions and bevel angles. Care {{should be taken to}} avoid melting excessive base material. Pulsed current is particularly useful for these applications, as it helps limit the heat input.

These include α-solanine, α-chaconine, enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, oxalic acid, and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used {{to ward off the}} insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided.</b>|$|E

Chronic exposure to 60 to 600mg/m3 can cause symptoms including fatigue, headaches and joint pains. At levels of 5000mg/m3, molybdenum is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|To avoid a {{potentially}} vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal {{is kept in}} an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition.

Onions and garlic are very dangerous and can cause severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the {{commission}} submitted a threefold plan of {{proposal to the}} government. First, the immediate dangers <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> by resetting the corners, removing stones that endangered the adjacent parts, strengthening the first balustrades and restoring several niches, archways, stupas and the main dome. Second, after fencing off the courtyards, proper maintenance should be provided and drainage should be improved by restoring floors and spouts. Third, all loose stones should be removed, the monument cleared {{up to the first}} balustrades, disfigured stones removed and the main dome restored. The total cost was estimated at that time around 48,800 Dutch guilders.|$|E
5|$|In general, blue-staining red-pored boletes <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> for consumption.

Rubroboletus pulcherrimus was the only bolete that had been implicated in the death of someone consuming it, It is known to contain low levels of muscarine, a peripheral nervous system toxin. until 2005.

5|$|The Cambridge Water Company were {{a company}} {{responsible}} for providing potable water to the inhabitants of Cambridge and the surrounding areas. In 1976, they purchased a borehole outside Sawston to deal with rising demand. In 1980, a European Directive was issued requiring nations of the European Community to establish standards {{on the presence of}} perchloroethene (PCE) in water, which the United Kingdom did in 1982. It was found that the Sawston borehole was contaminated with PCE that had originated in a tannery owned by Eastern Counties Leather. Prior to 1980, there was no knowledge that PCE <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> or that it could cause harm, but the Cambridge Water Company brought a case against Eastern Counties Leather anyway.|$|E
5|$|The drug label advises that {{bupropion}} {{should not}} be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, active brain tumors, or concurrent alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use and/or withdrawal. It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided</b> in individuals who are also taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). When switching from MAOIs to bupropion, {{it is important to}} include a washout period of about two weeks between the medications. The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating people with liver damage, severe kidney disease, and severe hypertension, and in children, adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} quality problems in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they can lead to weaker, less ductile welds. Dross is an especially common problem in aluminium GMAW welds, normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or base materials. Electrodes and workpieces must be brushed with a wire brush or chemically treated to remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen {{in contact with the}} weld pool, whether from the atmosphere or the shielding gas, causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert shielding gases is necessary, and welding in volatile air <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoided.</b>|$|E
40|$|With the {{development}} of optical technology, optic;mechanical;electric technology becomes a trend. An integrated, arrayed and miniaturized optical system was required. Binary optical element {{is famous for its}} excellent performance in light;wave transformation. Double;layer binary optical element has high diffraction efficiency over wide wavelength range. However, in the fabrication of double layer BOE, many errors occurred, such as height error, periodic error, multi;mask fabrication error etc. A theoretical analysis of these errors was carried out based on scalar diffraction theory, and a MATLAB simulation was implemented. The simulation result indicated that the diffraction efficiency deteriorated if the height errors occurred in different direction rather than in the same direction. Therefore, height errors from different direction <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoid</b> in fabrication. If the multi;mask fabrication error is occurred from different direction, the diffraction efficiency will decrease more quickly than from the same direction, so multi;mask fabrication error from different direction <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>avoid</b> as much as possible. Compared to height error and multi;mask fabrication error, other four errors have varying degrees of impact on the diffraction efficiency. © 2016, Editorial Board of Journal of Infrared and Laser Engineering.
