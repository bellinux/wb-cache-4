5000|$|Originally, {{the main}} turret was {{equipped}} with a 76.2mm gun KT obr.1927/32 adapted from the regimental field-gun obr.1927. By 1936, this weapon was being replaced by the KT-28 cannon (length of barrel 16.5 calibers), which was also used on the Т-28 medium tank. The mounting allowed for vertical training (aiming) with upper and lower limits of -7° and +23°, respectively. As an auxiliary weapon in the main turret, {{to the right of}} the cannon, the 7.62mm DT machine gun was placed autonomously in a ball setting. The cannon and machine gun had complete 360° horizontal <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and independent fire control systems. The spare DT machine gun was fastened in a loop setting in the storage niche of the turret. The mechanism to turn the turret employed an electromechanical three-speed drive; an auxiliary hand drive was also provided for emergency use. By 1937, an anti-aircraft DT machine gun was set in a P-40 mount on the foundation of the gunners hatch on the main turret.In 1938, the L-10 tank cannon was proposed for the main turret weapon, but the representatives of the ABTU (the [...] "Auto-Tank Directorate") abandoned this idea, considering the power of the KT-28 enough for the purpose of defeating enemy armored vehicles, and the accompaniment of attacking infantry was provided for by the two 45-mm cannons.|$|E

40|$|Sustainable Building Design and Engineering is an {{integrated}} approach to energy, health, and operational performance. Abu Dhabi, {{the capital of}} United Arab Emirates (UAE) is experiencing a phenomenal growth in built environment. In this context, the Abu Dhabi Government has taken initiatives and measures to sustainable building designs development. This research aimed to develop a guideline {{for the application of}} performance- based fire-engineering design with sustainable building designs. In addition, it builds a referral information base helping to build sustainable communities, where fire- related fatalities and risks mitigated. Identifying fire safety and sustainability relation, and assessing technical and regulatory challenges with performance-based designs (PBD) in buildings are also part of this study. It also investigated current practices in sustainable building design and fire safety measures applied by Abu Dhabi Civil Defence (ADCD) under the existing construction legislations. The overall results of the study addressed three main areas, namely, sustainability, fire safety, and legality of the construction industry in Abu Dhabi. The data obtained from the case studies, the questionnaire and face-to-face interviews revealed a strong element of misunderstanding regarding the accurate definition of sustainable building design in Abu Dhabi especially among the stakeholders, including the enforcers. This is by pushing towards sustainable design concepts and technologies without taking into consideration the effects on fire safety level from one side and misunderstanding of the local conditions that shape a local definition for building sustainability in Abu Dhabi hot humid climate. Second, the results relating to fire safety measures in Abu Dhabi showed that some factors in the <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> safety seemed to affect the accurate application of Performance- Based Design (PBD). These factors were considered as technical and administrative challenges facing the application of PBD and its safety level. Third, the existing local construction legislation and regulations do not support the application of sustainable building design in innovative designs that implementing fire engineering approach. This includes the lack of legislation, disintegration of requirements between building regulators and absence of law enforcement on building owners. The overall findings of this study showed that the application of fire engineering in the innovative sustainable design under the existing construction legislations and culture could have some serious issues to overcome before achieving accepted safety level. In conclusion, there is a common perception that application of sustainable building design can increase fire safety risk. Innovative fire engineering applications compromises on sustainability and vice-versa. A number of similar studies in Abu Dhabi have shown reduction in fire safety on applying performance- based designs. These are challenging issues with the Governments and they are concerned with the local authorities. The building industries in Abu Dhabi need guidelines to find a trade-off between fire safety and sustainability with application of performance based designs...|$|E

30|$|Veld {{fires are}} a common {{phenomenon}} in the predominantly savanna ecosystems of Zimbabwe. Until now no studies have investigated the causes, and socio-economic and environmental impacts <b>of</b> veld <b>fires</b> in Zimbabwe. Yet such information is crucial for planning and implementation <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> prevention and control practices. The present study uses multiple sources of information including review of published literature, reports from regulatory agencies, informal interviews and field observations to address the following objectives; (1) to identify the key causes <b>of</b> veld <b>fires</b> in Zimbabwe, (2) to investigate the socio-economic and environmental impacts <b>of</b> veld <b>fires,</b> (3) to highlight management practices for the control <b>of</b> veld <b>fires</b> and (4) to identify research gaps on causes and management <b>of</b> veld <b>fires</b> in Zimbabwe.

However, {{our understanding of the}} impacts <b>of</b> veld <b>fires</b> in Zimbabwe is limited due to limited data and research that has been carried out on the impacts <b>of</b> <b>fires.</b> We conclude that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to prevent wild <b>fires.</b> In view <b>of</b> this, <b>fire</b> management should move away from fire fighting to management practices such as early burning that reduces the negative impact, and enhance their positive effects <b>of</b> veld <b>fires.</b> To achieve this, it is imperative to integrate indigenous knowledge systems and modern techniques such as remote sensing and geoinformatics in the development of strategies for the use, prevention and control <b>of</b> veld <b>fires.</b> This review revealed that there is a critical lack of empirical research on fire in Zimbabwe. To address this information gap, there is urgent need to conduct research on the following thematic areas; mapping the patterns <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> risk using remote sensing and geoinformatics, and quantifying the impacts <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> on livelihoods, food security, public health, hydrology and greenhouse gas emissions at different spatial and temporal scales.|$|R

40|$|If {{public policy}} sectors like fire {{management}} are {{to support the}} adaptive capacity and adaptation of our social-economic-ecological systems, they themselves require a considerable adaptive capacity. Yet when arguing for adaptive approaches to policies and governance, literature concerned with climate change adaptation (CCA) often treat public administration {{as something of a}} mysterious ‘black box’ where ideal policies and implementation are a ‘natural’ results of research and community inputs. Mainstreaming adaptation into a policy sector cannot ignore the structuring influence <b>of</b> a <b>sector’s</b> current policy frames and informal institutions. Even less acknowledged is the role <b>of</b> a <b>sector’s</b> bureaucrats in the adaptive capacity <b>of</b> public policy <b>sectors.</b> To consider these issues, this thesis sought to address the central research question: what capacity for reflexive learning exists within the administration <b>of</b> the <b>fire</b> management <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> Victoria, Australia? The literature review directed attention to several key factors in reflexive learning in public sectors and provided the thesis its theoretical basis, which stems from the following: Policy frames, informal institutions and networks are key influences in a sector’s capacity for reflexive learning. Adaptation in public policy requires a capacity for deliberate reflection upon the policy frames and informal institutions that underlie and structure a sector’s practices, policy options and governance arrangements. It also requires exploration of multiple, alternate frames <b>of</b> the <b>sector’s</b> fundamental issues to increase the adaptability <b>of</b> a <b>sector’s</b> policy repertoire. To enable its adaptive capacity, a public policy sector needs to adopt an explicitly reflexive learning approach. The study combined frame, institutional and network analyses to explore these factors, and provide a more nuanced appreciation of the capacity for reflexive learning than may have been gleaned from a singular perspective. A key methodological contribution of this study was the application of this triangulated analytical framework to a public policy sector and using the perspectives <b>of</b> the <b>sector’s</b> bureaucrats. The policy <b>sector</b> <b>of</b> landscape <b>fire</b> management in the state of Victoria, Australia was chosen for the case study because of its complex formal institutional structure and because its two objectives – disaster risk reduction and ecological management – are often argued to be key CCA strategies. The research identified two dominant master-frames: emergency management and sustainability. While the majority of participants drew on a sustainability frame, the institutional analysis indicated that an emergency management frame is highly institutionalised within the sector. The findings suggest that it may be challenging to introduce perspectives that counter or do not ‘fit’ with the sector’s current policy frames and institutional landscape. The network analysis indicated a complex role for social networks in reflexive learning within the sector, a role that can both close down and open up the sector to new frames or ideas. Overall, this research aims to support fire management in its approach to disaster risk reduction (DRR) and CCA, and to inform the often called for interchange between DRR and CCA...|$|R
