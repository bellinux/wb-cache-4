40|$|Ultrasonic phased arrays {{are a new}} {{technology}} that offers considerable potential for inspecting construction welds. Using electronic control of the beam, phased arrays can scan, sweep, steer and focus the ultrasound. Since welds typically produce defects of known character and orientation, phased arrays can be programmed to optimize weld inspections. These inspections include standard ASME-type pulse echo raster <b>scans,</b> <b>zone</b> discrimination, TOFD and “specials”, depending on the vessel, weld profile, geometry and specifications. One advantage of phased arrays is inspection speed: linear travel speeds of up to 100 mm/sec are possible. Sizing is typically performed using diffraction approaches (TOFD and back diffraction), both well suited to phased arrays, {{as well as by}} pulse echo. Results can be obtained shortly after welding. Since phased arrays use preprogrammed set-ups, they are inherently flexible for many different weld and vessel configurations. Lastly, ultrasonics generates no safety hazards, so moving personnel or vessels is unnecessary. This presentation will describe how ultrasonic phased arrays work, what can be done with them, and gives examples of phased array inspection systems for pressure vessels. Examples of inspections on various vessels will include thick-sectioned welds inspected using both electronic raster <b>scans</b> and <b>zone</b> discrimination. Phased arrays are well suited to premium vessel inspections, which require multiple NDE techniques for Fitness-For-Purpose (Engineering Critical Assessment) inspections.

40|$|Soil piping {{remains a}} {{relatively}} unexplored phenomenon despite its substantial impacts on watershed-scale {{water and sediments}} transfer in numerous locations around the world. One of the main limits regarding the study of this singular process is characterization of the pipe networks (defining number, position, dimension and connectivity of pipes). In this context, non-invasive sub-surface imaging using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) seems a promising technique. An exploratory methodology was developed to assess the ability of GPR to characterize pipe networks in Loess-derived soil. This methodology relies on (1) high spatial resolution scanning and (2) detection of electromagnetic sub-surface indicators of soil pipe (reflection hyperbolas and strongest reflections).

Typically, {{the location of the}} B-lines follows the effects of gravity and is therefore often more pronounced in the posterior and lateral <b>scanning</b> <b>zones,</b> rather than the anterior zones. The pleura line should appear normal and intact [107 – 112]. B-lines are highly dynamic in cardiogenic {{pulmonary oedema}} [124, 125]. Due to its high sensitivity in detecting IS, the absence of IS on LUS {{can be used as a}} pivotal diagnostic tool in ruling out cardiogenic pulmonary oedema [107 – 112]. Absent B-lines has also been suggested as a fast way to rule out cardiogenic shock [126]. In both cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic IS, the change in the total number of B-lines has a potential role as a monitoring tool [5, 114, 120, 127 – 130]. If the total number of B-lines seen when performing diagnostic LUS is counted, then the total number seems to correlate to pulmonary artery systolic pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, extravascular lung water and prognosis [131 – 133].|$|R

The aim of this study was to find suitable and reproducible biomarkers for further clinical studies on intrinsic and extrinsic aging of dermis. Thermoporometry, hydric organization and thermal transitions of fresh and frozen skins were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to identify the absorption bands of the dermis especially in the 1800 – 1000 cm− 1 zone and to discriminate between the different secondary structures of proteins. A widening of the pore size distribution is evidenced with freezing, but there is no significant difference between the hydric organization and the endothermic collagen denaturation of fresh and frozen skins.

40|$|Abstract Background Combining {{characteristic}} morphological {{and functional}} information in one image increases pathophysiologic understanding {{as well as}} diagnostic accuracy in most clinical settings. En-face optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides a high resolution, transversal OCT image of the macular area combined with a confocal image of the same area (OCT C-scans). Creating an overlay image of a conventional angiographic image onto an OCT image, using the confocal part to facilitate transformation, combines structural and functional information of the retinal area of interest. This paper describes the construction of such overlay images and their aid in improving the interpretation of OCT C-scans. Methods In various patients, e n-face OCT C-scans (made with a prototype OCT-Ophthalmoscope (OTI, Canada) in use at the Department of Ophthalmology (Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)) and conventional fluorescein angiography (FA) were performed. ImagePro, with a custom made plug-in, was used to make an overlay-image. The confocal part of the OCT C-scan was used to spatially transform the FA image onto the OCT C-scan, using the vascular arcades as a reference. To facilitate visualization the transformed angiographic image and the OCT C-scan were combined in an RGB image. Results The confocal part of the OCT C-scan could easily be fused with angiographic images. Overlay showed a direct correspondence between retinal thickening and FA leakage in Birdshot retinochoroiditis, localized the subretinal neovascular membrane and correlated anatomic and vascular leakage features in myopia, and showed the extent of retinal and pigment epithelial detachment in retinal angiomatous proliferation as FA leakage was subject to blocked fluorescence. The overlay mode provided additional insight not readily available in either mode alone. Conclusion Combining conventional angiographic images and en-face OCT C-scans assists {{in the interpretation of}} both imaging modalities. By combining the physiopathological information in the angiograms with the structural information in the OCT <b>scan,</b> <b>zones</b> of leakage can be correlated to structural changes in the retina or pigment epithelium. This strategy could be used in the evaluation and monitoring of patients with complex central macular pathology. </p...|$|R

Each deviation, if present, was noted as upward or downward deviation. Each artifact was further described as per location on the <b>scan</b> and <b>zones</b> in the total scan area. A total of 1029 (26. 8 %) out of total 3840 scans had scan errors. The most common scan error was segmentation error (100 %), followed by degraded images (6. 70 %), blink artifacts (0. 09 %) and out of register artifacts (3. 3 %). Misidentification of the inner retinal layers was most frequent (62 %). Upward Deviation of the segmentation line (47. 91 %) and severe deviation (40. 3 %) were more often noted.

Relative MMP- 9 levels were measured by <b>scanning</b> the clear <b>zones</b> and analyzing the percentage inhibition. Results: Results showed that MMP- 9 activity was significantly decreased by both the drugs. Curcumin showed 61. 01 % reduction in the MMP- 9 activity at 1500 μg/ml concentration and doxycycline showed 59. 58 % reduction in the MMP- 9 activity at 300 μg/ml concentration. Conclusion: The current study showed that curcumin has inhibitory effect on polymorphonuclear leukocyte-type MMP- 9 involved in matrix degradation in periodontitis. Since Curcumin has a potent anti-inflammatory effect, it may have therapeutic potential as a host modulation agent in periodontal diseases...|$|R
40|$|Aims. We {{present a}} proper motion {{catalogue}} of 2 670 974 stars, covering the declination zone + 11 ◦ ≤ δ ≤ + 18 ◦. Methods. Proper motions {{were derived from}} the comparison of the positional M 2000 catalogue (systematic observations of the Bordeaux Carte du Ciel Zone with the meridian circle, completed in 2000) with positions derived from the reduction of 512 Carte du Ciel plates of the Bordeaux <b>zone</b> (<b>scanned</b> at the APM Cambridge), the AC 2000. 2 catalogue, the USNO–A 2. 0 catalogue and the unpublished Yellow Sky (YS 3) USNO catalogue. Results. The catalogue has a limiting magnitude VM = 16. 2 (Bordeaux CCD meridian circle magnitude) and is complete down to VM = 15. 4. Depending on magnitude, the positional precision at mean epoch ranges from 50 to 70 mas and the precision of proper motions varies from 1. 5 mas/yr to 6 mas/yr. Meridian VM magnitudes are provided for all objects together with additional photometry from the 2 MASS catalogue when available (99. 5 % of objects). Positions and proper motions are on the ICRS (International Celestial Reference System). Conclusions. Systematic offsets in 2 MASS positions and in UCAC 2 proper motions were revealed from comparisons with PM 2000. Key words.
