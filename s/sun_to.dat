5|$|By the 17th century, two {{developments}} {{allowed for}} the transits of planets {{across the face of}} the <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> be predicted and observed: the telescope and the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler, which assumed elliptical, rather than circular, planetary orbits.|$|E

5|$|The strongest {{high-pressure}} {{areas are}} associated with cold air masses which push away out of polar regions during the winter when there is less <b>sun</b> <b>to</b> warm neighboring regions. These Highs change character and weaken once they move further over relatively warmer water bodies.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method is}} to use the {{aberration}} of light, discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century. This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 arcseconds) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to the time needed to travel from the <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8minutes 12seconds to travel from the <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Convoys from Britain {{lacked the}} surface vessel escort after 13°W. Hudsons could only make sweeps up to 17°W but lacked {{endurance}} to stay there. From Gibraltar, {{the lack of}} flying boats meant a lack of air cover after 100 miles. Nevertheless, great efforts were made with limited resources to provide cover from first to last light, the time when U-boats could use the rising and setting <b>sun</b> <b>to</b> see the silhouettes on the horizon.|$|E

5|$|Hale–Bopp became {{visible to}} the naked eye in May 1996, and {{although}} its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. It was too closely aligned with the <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|High-energy gamma-ray photons {{initially}} released with fusion {{reactions in}} the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, {{it takes a long}} time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000years. In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the <b>Sun,</b> <b>to</b> reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.|$|E
5|$|In Theosophy, it is {{believed}} the Seven Stars of the Pleiades transmit the spiritual energy of the Seven Rays from the Galactic Logos to the Seven Stars of the Great Bear, then to Sirius.

5|$|Late in the Nineteenth Dynasty the Book of Caverns, which {{divided the}} underworld into massive caverns {{containing}} deities {{as well as}} the deceased waiting for the <b>sun</b> <b>to</b> pass through and restore them to life, was placed in the upper parts of tombs. A complete version appears in the tomb of Ramesses VI. The burial of Ramesses III saw the Book of the Earth, where the underworld is divided into four sections, climaxing in the sun disc being pulled from the earth by Naunet.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} studies give two thermoregulatory roles for the sail of Dimetrodon: one {{as a means of}} warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way to cool down when body {{temperature}} becomes high. Dimetrodon and all other Early Permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying on the <b>sun</b> <b>to</b> maintain a high body temperature. Because of its large size, Dimetrodon had high thermal inertia, meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in the mornings, the small-bodied prey of Dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of Dimetrodon. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that the sail of Dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail's large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. Dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from the <b>sun</b> <b>to</b> cool off or restricted blood flow to the sail to maintain heat at night.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{differential}} rotation is observed on {{stars such as}} the Sun when the angular velocity varies with latitude. Typically the angular velocity decreases with increasing latitude. However the reverse has also been observed, such as on the star designated HD31993. The first such star, other than the <b>Sun,</b> <b>to</b> have its {{differential rotation}} mapped in detail is AB Doradus.|$|E

5|$|After {{beginning}} the 1998–99 {{season on the}} Canucks' top line, Bertuzzi was limited to 32 games due to injuries, {{the first of which}} was a fractured tibia. He suffered the injury on November 1, 1998, after a shot by teammate Mattias Öhlund hit him in the leg. His season was later ended with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee, suffered during a game on March 5, 1999. He recorded 8 goals and 16 points in 1998–99. In the off-season, Bertuzzi became a restricted free agent and was re-signed by the Canucks to a two-year contract in September 1999. The deal was reported by The Vancouver <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> be worth a little over $2 million.|$|E
5|$|Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due {{to their}} faintness, {{there have been a}} number of successes in {{determining}} their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts of methane ice. For the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the albedos have been determined. These objects largely fall into two classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference in colors and albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these objects, with the surfaces of those that formed far enough from the <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Melville Hall in the University of St. Andrews was {{the setting}} for the Dover Recovery Centre. Nearly thirty film extras, film producers, and {{location}} scouts had to wait several hours for the <b>sun</b> <b>to</b> set so they could film the scenes there. The restaurant scene, which is featured in the trailer and in promotional screenshots, {{was shot in the}} Regent Restaurant and Coffee Lounge in Weston-super-Mare in April 2009. Chiswick Town Hall, a dark building in London, was also used as a shooting location. The scenes where the Hailsham assemblies were held was filmed at a school in Snaresbrook, called Forest School, in May 2009. Ham House, Richmond, was used for filming mostly exterior scenes at Hailsham School and a couple of interior scenes.|$|E

50|$|However, in {{his second}} year with the team, he helped bring them back to the playoffs with his play on both the {{offensive}} and defensive sides of the ball. In {{the first round of the}} 2010 NBA Playoffs, Richardson led the <b>Suns</b> <b>to</b> a first-round victory over the Portland Trail Blazers, including a career playoff-high 42 points in a Game 3 blowout. In the next round, Richardson helped the <b>Suns</b> <b>to</b> a series sweep against the San Antonio Spurs, before falling to the Los Angeles Lakers in game 6 of the Western Conference Finals.|$|R

5|$|Based {{on their}} orbital characteristics, short-period comets {{are thought to}} {{originate}} from the centaurs and the Kuiper belt/scattered disc —a disk of objects in the trans-Neptunian region—whereas the source of long-period comets {{is thought to be}} the far more distant spherical Oort cloud (after the Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort who hypothesised its existence). Vast swarms of comet-like bodies are thought to orbit the Sun in these distant regions in roughly circular orbits. Occasionally the gravitational influence of the outer planets (in the case of Kuiper belt objects) or nearby stars (in the case of Oort cloud objects) may throw one of these bodies into an elliptical orbit that takes it inwards toward the <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> form a visible comet. Unlike the return of periodic comets, whose orbits have been established by previous observations, the appearance of new comets by this mechanism is unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|Chépart {{himself was}} taken captive by the Natchez, {{who were at}} first unsure {{what to do with}} him, but finally decided that he should be killed by a stinkard—a member of the lowest caste in the tribe's hierarchy. The Natchez kept two Frenchmen alive, a carter named Mayeux who was made to carry all the goods of the French to the Great Village, and a tailor named Le Beau who was {{employed}} by the Natchez to refit the colonists' clothing to new owners. They set fire to the fort, the store, and all the homesteads, burning them to the ground. Just as Governor Bienville had done with the executed Indians in 1717 and 1723, the Natchez beheaded the dead Frenchmen and brought the severed heads for the Great <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> view.|$|E
5|$|If a comet is {{traveling}} fast enough, it may leave the Solar System. Such comets follow the open {{path of a}} hyperbola, and as such they are called hyperbolic comets. To date, comets are only known to be ejected by interacting with another object in the Solar System, such as Jupiter. An {{example of this is}} thought to be Comet C/1980 E1, which was shifted from a predicted orbit of 7.1 million years around the <b>Sun,</b> <b>to</b> a hyperbolic trajectory, after a 1980 close pass by the planet Jupiter.|$|E
