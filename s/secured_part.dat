500|$|On July 15, 1784, Kościuszko {{set off for}} Poland, {{where he}} arrived on August 26. Due to a {{conflict}} between his patrons, the Czartoryski family, and King Stanisław August Poniatowski, Kościuszko once again failed to get a commission in the Commonwealth Army. He settled in Siechnowicze ( [...] , now Sehnovichi, Belarus). His brother Józef had lost most of the family's lands through bad investments, but {{with the help of}} his sister Anna, Kościuszko <b>secured</b> <b>part</b> of the lands for himself. [...] He decided to limit his male peasants' corvée (obligatory service to the lord of the manor) to two days a week, and completely exempted the female peasants. His estate soon stopped being profitable, and he began going into debt. The situation was not helped by failure of the money promised by the American government—interest on late payment for his seven years' military service—to materialize. Kościuszko struck up friendships with liberal activists; Hugo Kołłątaj offered him a position as lecturer at Kraków's Jagiellonian University, which Kościuszko declined.|$|E

A week later, Operation Goodwood renewed the British offensive, and Caen finally fell on 19 July, although by this time the city had been largely devastated.

The Gloria Wise group was a non-profit organization, partially funded by the city of New York, which provided services for children and seniors in the Bronx.
