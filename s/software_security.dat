25|$|From time to time, new {{vulnerabilities}} {{are discovered}} in various versions of Adobe Reader, prompting {{the company to}} issue security fixes. Other PDF readers are also susceptible. One aggravating factor is that a PDF reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PDF reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities {{are a result of}} the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in the PDF reader can help mitigate such future exploits, although it does not protect against exploits {{in other parts of the}} PDF viewing <b>software.</b> <b>Security</b> experts say that JavaScript is not essential for a PDF reader, and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any compatibility issues caused. One way of avoiding PDF file exploits is to have a local or web service convert files to another format before viewing.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2010, Google <b>software</b> <b>security</b> {{engineer}} Will Drewry discussed Chrome OS security. Drewry described Chrome OS as a [...] "hardened" [...] {{operating system}} featuring auto-updating and sandbox features that will reduce malware exposure. He said that Chrome OS netbooks will be shipped with Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and include both a [...] "trusted bootpath" [...] and a physical switch under the battery compartment that actuates a developer mode. That mode drops some specialized security functions but increases developer flexibility. Drewry also {{emphasized that the}} open source nature of the operating system will contribute greatly to its security by allowing constant developer feedback.|$|E
2500|$|An {{issue that}} affects all the {{international}} {{partners in the}} F-35 involves access to the computer software codes for the aircraft. The F-35 relies heavily on software for operation of radar, weapons, flight controls and also maintenance. The US military has stated that [...] "no country involved {{in the development of}} the jets will have access to the software codes" [...] and has indicated that all software upgrades will be done in the US. The US government acknowledges that Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Turkey have all expressed dissatisfaction with that unilateral US decision. The UK specifically indicated they might cancel its entire order of F-35s without access to the coding, without which the nation will be unable to maintain its own aircraft. Allen Sens, a defence analyst at the University of British Columbia stated in November 2009: [...] "What has happened is really quite unusual because we're talking about some of America's very close allies. You would have thought they could build in some maintenance codes that could be accessible to their allies." [...] Sens indicated that the decision could be as a result of concerns about <b>software</b> <b>security</b> and also pressure from Congress to protect jobs in the US.|$|E
2500|$|Experts {{believe that}} Stuxnet {{required}} {{the largest and}} costliest development effort in malware history. Developing its many capabilities would have required a team of highly capable programmers, in-depth knowledge of industrial processes, and an interest in attacking industrial infrastructure. Eric Byres, who has years of experience maintaining and troubleshooting Siemens systems, told Wired that writing the code would have taken many man-months, if not years. Symantec estimates that the group developing Stuxnet would have consisted of anywhere from five to thirty people, and would have taken six months to prepare. The Guardian, the BBC and The New York Times all claimed that (unnamed) experts studying Stuxnet believe {{the complexity of the}} code indicates that only a nation-state would have the capabilities to produce it. The origin is unknown beyond rumour, however. The self-destruct and other safeguards within the code could imply that a Western government was responsible, or at least is responsible in the development of it. <b>Software</b> <b>security</b> expert Bruce Schneier initially condemned the 2010 news coverage of Stuxnet as hype, however, stating that it was almost entirely based on speculation. But after subsequent research, Schneier stated in 2012 that [...] "we can now conclusively link Stuxnet to the centrifuge structure at the Natanz nuclear enrichment lab in Iran".|$|E
