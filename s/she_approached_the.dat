5|$|Dr. John Markway narrates {{the history}} of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was {{constructed}} by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree as <b>she</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> house for the first time. Crain remarried, but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. Crain's daughter Abigail lived in the house {{for the rest of her}} life, never moving out of the nursery. She died calling for her nurse-companion. The companion inherited the house, but later hanged herself from a spiral staircase in the library. Hill House was eventually inherited by a Mrs. Sanderson, although it has stood empty for some time.|$|E
5|$|Hepburn's next feature, Stage Door (1937), paired {{her with}} Ginger Rogers in {{a role that}} {{mirrored}} her own life—that of a wealthy society girl {{trying to make it}} as an actress. Hepburn was praised for her work at early previews, which gave her top billing over Rogers. The film was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but it was not the box-office hit RKO had hoped for. Industry pundits blamed Hepburn for the small profit, but the studio continued its commitment to resurrecting her popularity. She was cast in Howard Hawks' screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby (1938), where she played a flighty heiress who loses a leopard while trying to woo a palaeontologist (Cary Grant). <b>She</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> physical comedy of the film with confidence, and took tips on comedic timing from her costar Walter Catlett. Bringing Up Baby was acclaimed by critics, but it was nevertheless unsuccessful at the box office. With the genre and Grant both hugely popular at the time, biographer A. Scott Berg believes the blame lay with moviegoers' rejection of Hepburn.|$|E

Black Joke suffered no casualties; Providentia had numerous of her crew killed and wounded.|$|E

Born in Maryborough, Queensland, Australia, Hansen earned the most {{attention}} for her vocal work with Stereolab, although she also played the guitar and keyboards. The music journalist Pierre Perrone said that Hansen's [...] "playful nature and mischievous sense of humour came through in the way <b>she</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> backing vocals she contributed to Stereolab and the distinctive harmonies she created with Sadier." [...] For the next few months, Stereolab lay dormant as the members grieved. They eventually decided to continue.

500|$|The {{idea for}} a film version of the 1817 Austen novel Persuasion began with the English {{producer}} Fiona Finlay, who had wanted to create an adaptation for several years. The novel had last been adapted by ITV in a 1971 serial starring Ann Firbank. Finlay felt that the [...] "very romantic" [...] story was one [...] "everyone can relate to. There's something very touching about long-lost love". <b>She</b> <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> writer Nick Dear about adapting it for television; Finlay had enjoyed his contributions to theatre, particularly his play about William Hogarth, The Art of Success. Dear first suggested they try one of Austen's other works—either Sense and Sensibility or Pride and Prejudice—but agreed to adapt Persuasion after reading it. Dear considered the novel—the author's last completed work—a maturer story than the others.|$|E

[...] Braxton subsequently performed the song live on The Rosie O'Donnell Show on October 7, 1998. Disney executive Michael Eisner, who attended Braxton's first show, was so pleased with the ballad that he decided [...] "A Change in Me" [...] should be written into every other production of Beauty and the Beast that was running at the time.
