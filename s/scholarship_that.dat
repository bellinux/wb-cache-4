5|$|Despite {{arguments}} {{put forward}} by authors who have questioned {{the existence of a}} historical Jesus, there remains a strong consensus in historical-critical biblical <b>scholarship</b> <b>that</b> a historical Jesus did live in that area and in that time period.|$|E
5|$|Innis {{laid the}} basis for <b>scholarship</b> <b>that</b> looked at the social {{sciences}} from a distinctly Canadian point of view. As {{the head of the}} University of Toronto's political economy department, he worked to build up a cadre of Canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on British or American-trained professors unfamiliar with Canada's history and culture. He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research.|$|E
5|$|The Bruges {{exhibition}} {{renewed interest}} in the period and initiated <b>scholarship</b> <b>that</b> was to flourish in the 20th century. Johan Huizinga was the first historian to place Netherlandish art squarely in the Burgundian period – outside of nationalistic borders – suggesting in his book The Waning of the Middle Ages, published in 1919, that the flowering of the school in the early 15th century resulted wholly from the tastes set by the Burgundian court. Another exhibition visitor, Georges Hulin de Loo, published an independent critical catalogue highlighting {{the large number of}} mistakes in the official catalogue, which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners. He and Max Friedländer, who visited and wrote a review of the Bruges exhibition, went on to become leading scholars in the field.|$|E

5|$|The {{colonialism}} that Atangana {{had supported}} was ruinous in Cameroon. Production centred on enriching the chiefs, wooing of foreign investment, and the apparatus of colonial administration, and building only that infrastructure that would {{aid in the}} transport and export of cash crops. Nevertheless, Atangana's story became part of Beti folklore. For example, Beti storytellers related his tale in oral poems and songs that took up to a full night to recite. His legacy was largely forgotten by the nation at large between his death and Cameroonian independence. However, the nationalist <b>scholarship</b> <b>that</b> blossomed after Cameroon's independence in 1960 resurrected his story. Charles Atangana Avenue in downtown Yaoundé is named for him. A statue in his likeness tops a hill nearby, which had fallen into disrepair by 2000.|$|E
5|$|Zenobia: {{the wife}} of Odaenathus was accused by the Augustan History of having {{formerly}} conspired with Maeonius, as Hairan I was her stepson {{and she could not}} accept that he was the heir to her husband instead of her own children. However, there is no suggestion in the Augustan History that Zenobia was involved in the event that saw her husband's murder; the act is attributed to Maeonius' degeneracy and jealousy. Those accounts by the Augustan History can be dismissed as fiction. The hints in modern <b>scholarship</b> <b>that</b> Zenobia had a hand in the assassination out of her desire to rule the empire and dismay with her husband's pro-Roman policy can be dismissed as there was no reversal of that policy during the first years following Odaenathus' death.|$|E
5|$|After {{writing his}} senior thesis on Kenyan {{education}} under British colonial rule and graduating with a bachelor's degree in history, Johnson declined the postgraduate <b>scholarship</b> <b>that</b> {{he was awarded}} and played five years in Italy followed by two in Spain. Johnson played professional basketball in the Lega Basket Serie A and Legadue Basket in Italy and Liga Española de Baloncesto in Spain, one season each for Gorizia Pallacanestro A2, Viola Reggio Calabria, Adecco Milano/Ducato Siena, Casademont Girona and Montepaschi Siena. He played two seasons with the Avellino in Italy from 2000–2002. He had a seven-year professional career before becoming a coach. In 1998, he won an Italian Second Division championship as a starter for Gorizia Pallacanestro. In 1999, he earned another league championship with for Reggio Calabria, and in his final professional season in 2004 he earned a league title with Siena. With Reggio Calabria, he teamed with Brent Scott, Brian Oliver, and Manu Ginóbili to win a championship.|$|E

5|$|Davidson's family {{assumed that}} he would follow his father in {{becoming}} a priest and he was brought up strictly. When he was six he began attending Banister Court School in Southampton, an establishment founded initially for the sons of Merchant Navy officers. In 1890 Harold was sent to live with two maiden aunts in Croydon while he attended the Whitgift School. Here he became an enthusiastic amateur actor, encouraged by his friendship with a fellow-pupil, Leon Quartermaine, who later won recognition {{on the stage and}} in films. In February 1894 the pair appeared together in a school production of the farce Sent to the Tower. Under his aunts' influence, Davidson became a part-time worker at Toynbee Hall, an East End charity founded by Samuel and Henrietta Barnett which attracted many volunteers from schools and universities. Because of these distractions he neglected his school work and failed to win a <b>scholarship</b> <b>that</b> would enable him to attend Oxford University and study for holy orders. In the face of his father's disapproval, he decided to pursue a career as a stage comedian.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, Josquin {{gradually}} {{acquired the}} {{reputation as the}} greatest composer of the age, his mastery of technique and expression universally imitated and admired. Writers as diverse as Baldassare Castiglione and Martin Luther wrote about his reputation and fame; theorists such as Heinrich Glarean and Gioseffo Zarlino held his style as that best representing perfection. He was so admired that many anonymous compositions were attributed to him by copyists, probably to increase their sales. More than 370 works are attributed to him; {{it was only after}} the advent of modern analytical <b>scholarship</b> <b>that</b> some of these attributions were challenged, and revealed as mistaken, on the basis of stylistic features and manuscript evidence. Yet in spite of Josquin's colossal reputation, which endured until the beginning of the Baroque era and was revived in the 20th century, his biography is shadowy, and virtually nothing is known about his personality. The only surviving work which may be in his own hand is a graffito {{on the wall of the}} Sistine Chapel, and only one contemporary mention of his character is known, in a letter to Duke Ercole I of Ferrara. The lives of dozens of less revered Renaissance composers are better documented than that of Josquin.|$|E

25|$|In 1939, when he {{was seven}} years old, Naipaul's family moved to Trinidad's capital, Port of Spain, where Naipaul {{enrolled}} in the government-run Queen's Royal College, a well-regarded school that was modelled after a British public school. Upon graduation, Naipaul won a Trinidad Government <b>scholarship</b> <b>that</b> allowed him to study at any institution of higher learning in the British Commonwealth; he chose Oxford.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{graduation}} from Central High in 1947, Bright initially accepted a football scholarship at Michigan State University, but, apparently {{unhappy with the}} direction of the Spartans football program, transferred to Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, where he accepted a track and field <b>scholarship</b> <b>that</b> allowed him to try out for the football and basketball squads. Bright eventually lettered in football, track, and basketball, during his collegiate career at Drake.|$|E

25|$|In {{pursuit of}} his goal, Chona secured a <b>scholarship</b> <b>that</b> {{took him to}} London in 1955, where he studied at Gray's Inn. He was called to the bar in 1958. While in England, he met other African nationalists, {{including}} Harry Nkumbula and Kenneth Kaunda. He also made contact with London-based White supporters of the nationalist cause, such as Simon Zukas and Doris Lessing. This was also when he adopted the name Mathias Mainza Chona by deed poll.|$|E
25|$|In November 2014, {{colleges and}} {{universities}} with ties to Cosby began removing their affiliations with him. The University of Massachusetts Amherst, one of Cosby's alma maters, asked Cosby to step down as an honorary co-chairman of the university's fundraising campaign. The Berklee College of Music, which had previously awarded Cosby with an honorary degree, got rid of a <b>scholarship</b> <b>that</b> it offered in Cosby's name. High Point University in North Carolina also pulled Cosby from its advisory board, and Freed-Hardeman University rescinded its invitation for Cosby to appear at an annual dinner in December.|$|E

25|$|Glasney College {{was founded}} at Penryn, Cornwall in 1265 by Bishop Bronescombe {{and was the}} centre of ecclesiastical power in Cornwall's Middle Ages and {{probably}} the best known and most important of Cornwall's monastic institutions. Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries, between 1536 and 1545, signalled {{the end of the}} big Cornish priories but as a Chantry Church, Glasney held on until 1548 when it suffered the same fate. The smashing and looting of Cornish colleges such as Glasney and Crantock brought an end to the formal <b>scholarship</b> <b>that</b> had helped sustain the Cornish language and Cornish cultural identity.|$|E
25|$|With this understood, {{almost all}} Syriac {{scholars}} {{agree that the}} Peshitta gospels are translations of the Greek originals. However, there is a minority viewpoint in <b>scholarship</b> <b>that</b> the Aramaic New Testament of the Peshitta represents the original New Testament and the Greek is a translation of it. The type of text represented by Peshitta is the Byzantine. In a detailed examination of Matthew 1–14, Gwilliam found that the Peshitta agrees with the Textus Receptus only 108 times and with Codex Vaticanus 65 times. Meanwhile, in 137 instances it differs from both, usually {{with the support of}} the Old Syriac and the Old Latin, and in 31 instances it stands alone.|$|E
