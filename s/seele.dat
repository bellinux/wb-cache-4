50|$|The Magi {{supercomputers}} of NERV {{are named}} Melchior, Balthasar and Caspar after the names traditionally {{given for the}} Magi who were mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew as having visited Jesus Christ in Bethlehem. The Marduk Institute is a front organization for Nerv, tasked with finding the teenagers suitable for piloting Evangelion units. Marduk {{was the name of}} the chief Babylonian deity and patron god of the city of Babylon. The Tree of Sephiroth (Tree of Life) is mentioned, as well as shown in the opening title sequence and in Gendo's office, with Hebrew inscriptions on it (the terms written there are mostly Kabbalic). It also appears in The End of Evangelion during <b>Seele's</b> version of Instrumentality. <b>SEELE's</b> logo is a reference to the Old Testament's description of Yahweh, possessing seven eyes.|$|R

500|$|The cantata was Bach's {{first for}} the {{occasion}} in Leipzig. Early in his career he had written at least one cantata for the equivalent service at Mühlhausen. There are five surviving cantatas for the Ratswechsel at Leipzig, and librettos of three more, [...] BWV Anh. I 3, 4 and 193. The other four extant cantatas are Ihr Tore zu Zion, BWV 193, composed for the occasion in 1727 but partly lost, Wir danken dir, Gott, wir danken dir, BWV 29, composed for the occasion in 1731, Gott, man lobet dich in der Stille, BWV 120, adapted from earlier cantatas for wedding and homage probably in 1742, and Lobe den Herrn, meine <b>Seele,</b> BWV 69, adapted from Lobe den Herrn, meine <b>Seele,</b> BWV 69a, for the occasion in 1748.|$|E

5000|$|Luc Zeebroek (born 5 May 1956), {{better known}} as Kamagurka, is a Belgian cartoonist, playwright, comic strip artist, painter, comedian, comedic singer and {{television}} producer, known for the absurd nature of his work.

500|$|In 1724 Johann Sebastian Bach {{composed}} the church cantata Meine Seel erhebt den Herren, BWV10, {{as part of}} his second cantata cycle. Taken from Martin Luther's German translation of the Magnificat canticle ("Meine <b>Seele</b> erhebt den Herren"), the title translates as [...] "My soul magnifies the Lord". Also known as Bach's German Magnificat, the work follows his chorale cantata format.|$|E
500|$|Bach {{had earlier}} {{composed}} two other cantatas for the twelfth Sunday after Trinity, {{in his first}} year in Leipzig Lobe den Herrn, meine <b>Seele,</b> BWV 69a, first performed on 15 August 1723, and in his third year Lobe den Herren, den mächtigen König der Ehren, BWV 137, first performed on 19 August 1725, as an added part of his cycle of chorale cantatas. Both works focus on praise (Lob) and use an orchestra including festive trumpets.|$|E
500|$|The {{traditional}} {{setting of}} Luther's German {{translation of the}} Magnificat ("Meine <b>Seele</b> erhebt den Herren") is a [...] German variant of the , a rather exceptional psalm tone in Gregorian chant. The tonus peregrinus (or ninth tone) {{is associated with the}} ninth mode or Aeolian mode. For the traditional setting of Luther's German Magnificat that is the minor mode for which the last note of the melodic formula is the tonic, a fifth below its opening note.|$|E
50|$|Bert {{is one of}} Humo's mascots and {{therefore}} often used on magazine covers or other related merchandising. He was seen in animated form in the opening titles of Kamagurka and Herr <b>Seele's</b> TV sketch show Lava (1989).

5000|$|Introduced in Rebuild of Evangelion, Mark.06 (Mākushikkusu) {{is first}} {{seen at the}} end of the first film and fully appears in the second film. It was {{initially}} designed with blue armor with a glowing red visor covering its eyes and head design similar to Unit 01. Underneath its armor, the Eva unit has dark gray skin decorated on the torso with a seven-eyed purple mask that is partially covered by a gray and red mask engraved with the words [...] "Project Evangelion". In the 1.01 DVD release, Mark.06 has a glowing white halo. The narration states that it and its pilot [...] "come down from the Moon". It is of <b>SEELE's</b> design who describe it as [...] "the true Evangelion"; Gendo and Fuyutsuki had no hand in its creation.|$|R
50|$|Misato's job(s) {{before being}} {{employed}} at Nerv are not specified, {{but in the}} manga, her last job involved genetic experimentation on animals, as Pen Pen {{was a result of}} one such experiment. She chose to keep Pen Pen as a pet rather than let him be euthanized, and converted a refrigerator into a heated sleeping area for him. Her relationship with Kaji appears to be rather complicated, involving feelings of love, lust, jealousy, and an association of him to her father, apart from a bizarre love triangle that includes Ritsuko. In the developing of the story Misato discovers that Kaji, besides of working for Nerv, secretly he is also working for the Intelligence Department of Japan. Misato threatens to kill him if he does not desist from his sabotage plans. However, thanks to him she begins to realize what Nerv and <b>Seele's</b> secret plans are, most remarkably the Human Instrumentality Project.|$|R
500|$|The canticle , one {{of three}} New Testament canticles, {{has long been a}} regular part of the liturgy in daily vesper services. After the Reformation, Martin Luther kept the Magnificat in the liturgy. He {{provided}} a German translation of the canticle, [...] "Meine <b>Seele</b> erhebt den Herren" [...] (which Bach used as the basis for his chorale cantata Meine Seel erhebt den Herren, BWV 10). However, the Latin text was also permitted in Lutheran worship. The canticle was often set to music. Contemporary extended settings include works by Heinichen and by Vivaldi.|$|E
500|$|Die <b>Seele</b> (The Souls), a work by painter Jan Balet (1913–2009), {{shows an}} angel trumpeting over a flower garden while a tiger devours a uniformed French soldier. The Indian painter M. F. Husain painted Tipu's Tiger in his {{characteristic}} style in 1986 titling {{the work as}} [...] "Tipu Sultan's Tiger". The sculptor Dhruva Mistry, when {{a student at the}} Royal College of Art, adjacent to the Victoria and Albert Museum, frequently passed Tipu's Tiger in its glass case and was inspired to make a fibre-glass and plastic sculpture Tipu in 1986. The sculpture Rabbit eating Astronaut (2004) by the artist Bill Reid is a humorous homage to the tiger, the rabbit [...] "chomping" [...] when its tail is cranked round.|$|E
500|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata {{in seven}} movements. The text and tune of the hymn {{are kept in}} the outer choral movements, a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, which frame a sequence of recitatives and [...] arias, one recitative with a chorale cantus firmus. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two recorders (Fl), flauto traverso (Ft), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), violoncello piccolo (Vp) and basso continuo. The title page of the autograph score reads: [...] "CONCERTO. / Dominica 20 post Trinit: / Schmücke dich o liebe <b>Seele</b> etc. / a 4 Voci / Traversiere / 2 Flauti. / 2 Hautbois / 2 Violini / Viola. / Continuo / di / Signore / Joh:Seb:Bach." ...|$|E
500|$|Bach's Nekrolog, the 1754 {{obituary}} {{written by}} Johann Friedrich Agricola and the composer's son Carl Philipp Emanuel, mentions that the composer wrote several Magnificats. Apart from the extant copies of BWV 243/243a, of the German Magnificat BWV 10 {{and of the}} chorale harmonisation BWV 324, a Magnificat for soprano solo was considered lost in the 19th century. The score of that so-called [...] "little" [...] Magnificat (...) was rediscovered in the 20th century, and listed as BWV Anh. 21; however, its authenticity was doubted. In 1982 Melchior Hoffmann was identified as the composer of this German Magnificat Meine Seel erhebt den Herren. A similar cantata on a German paraphrase of the Magnificat, Meine <b>Seele</b> rühmt und preist, BWV 189 for tenor solo and composed for Visitation, has also been attributed to Hoffmann.|$|E
500|$|The last aria in each {{of these}} sets of arias is first a solo, then a duet, then a terzet (trio). When {{inserting}} the Christmas hymns, building up to the seventh movement alternates arias with choral movements, while {{in the second half of}} the composition the choral movements at the outer ends are separated by a set of four arias: solo → solo → duet → trio. In such sixteen-movement performance there is however another symmetry: the third section (movement A), and the third counting down from the last (movement 10) both use a Lutheran chorale melody as cantus firmus: soprano voices in the first case ("Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her"), instrumental in the second ("Meine <b>Seele</b> erhebt den Herren"). The symmetry of the Christmas version can be pictured as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{characteristics}} of the Magnificats and Visitation cantatas {{of the first half}} of the 18th century are combined in Bach's German Magnificat: it uses text of Luther's translation of the Magnificat, like BWVAnh.21 and Picander's 1728 libretto, and it uses text paraphrased from the Magnificat like BWV189 and the 1725 Visitation cantata. Like the Meiningen libretto used for JLB13 the cantata not only starts with a dictum but also has a second dictum, directly quoted from Luther's translation of the New Testament, near the middle of the cantata (movement 4, [...] "Meine <b>Seele</b> erhebt den Herrn", in Johann Ludwig's cantata, and movement 5, [...] "Er denket der Barmherzigkeit" [...] in BWV10). This characteristic sets BWV10 apart from Bach's other chorale cantatas, which as a rule contained quotes from Lutheran hymns, not from biblical prose.|$|E
500|$|In {{the opening}} chorale fantasia, [...] "" [...] (Ah, dear Christians, be comforted), Bach expresses two {{thoughts}} of the text, comfort and fear, by contrasting themes that appear simultaneously in the instruments: an assertive theme {{is derived from the}} melody and played by the two oboes and first violins, an [...] "anxious" [...] one in the second violins and the continuo. The soprano sings the melody as a cantus firmus, doubled by the horn, while the lower voices are set partly in expressive imitation, partly in homophony. They are treated differently to reflect the meaning of the text. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann compares the movement to the opening of the cantata Jesu, der du meine <b>Seele,</b> BWV 78, written three weeks earlier: both [...] "a sort of chaconne" [...] in G minor, with a [...] "French style" [...] bass as [...] "the expression of mourning and lamentation".|$|E
500|$|Prior to Crown Fountain, Plensa's {{dominant}} theme {{had been}} dualism, {{which he had}} expanded to artworks in which the viewers are outside, and the visible subjects of the art are inside containers and hollow spaces. [...] In the 1990s, he completed several outdoor sculptures in which he explored the use of light (The Star of David (1998) at Stockholm's Raoul Wallenberg Square, Bridge of Light (1998) in Jerusalem), and [...] LED technology, video, and computer design (Gläserne <b>Seele</b> & Mr. Net in Brandenburg (1999–2000)). [...] In his public art, Plensa challenged himself to involve the viewer with his art, which led to his conception of the Crown Fountain. [...] His objective [...] {{was to create a}} socially relevant, interactive [...] fountain for the 21stcentury. [...] Since water is the focus of a fountain, and since Chicago, and especially Millennium Park, is so greatly affected by the nearby waterfront, Plensa sought to create an eternal water work to complement the local natural inspirations. Because of the colder winters common to the climate of Chicago, Plensa created a fountain that would remain vibrant when the water was inactive in the wintertime, so the fountain is an experience of light themes and the use of video technology.|$|E
500|$|Shinji {{is forced}} to fight an {{infected}} Evangelion Unit-03 and watch how its pilot, classmate Toji Suzuhara, is wounded (killed in the manga). Asuka loses her self-confidence following a defeat, and spirals into depression. This is worsened by her next fight, against an Angel which attacks her mind and forces her to relieve her worst fears and hidden insecurities. In the next battle, Rei self-destructs Unit-00 and dies to save Shinji's life. Misato and Shinji visit the hospital where they find Rei alive but claiming she is [...] "the third Rei". Misato forces Ritsuko to reveal the dark secrets of Nerv, the Evangelion boneyard and the dummy plug system which operates using clones of Rei. These succession of events leave Shinji emotionally scarred, and alienate him {{from the rest of}} the characters. Kaworu Nagisa replaces the catatonic Asuka as pilot of Unit-02. Kaworu, who initially befriends Shinji and gains his trust, is in truth the final Angel, Tabris. Kaworu fights Shinji, then realizes that he must die if humanity is to thrive and asks Shinji to kill him. Shinji hesitates but eventually kills him. [...] After the final Angel is defeated, <b>Seele</b> triggers the [...] "Human Instrumentality Project", a forced evolution of humanity in which the souls of all mankind are merged together through Rei. Shinji's soul grapples with the reason for his existence and reaches an epiphany that he needs others to thrive, enabling him to destroy the wall of negative emotions that torment him and reunite with the others, who congratulate him.|$|E

NERV major Misato Katsuragi orders Asuka moved to the cockpit of Evangelion Unit 02 and placed {{at the bottom of}} a lake, then rescues Shinji from JSSDF troops. Determined to have Shinji defend NERV, Misato brings Shinji to Unit 01's bay doors, but is shot in the process.
