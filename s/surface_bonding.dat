Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern analysis exhibit the highly crystalline nanoparticles of silicon.

The calculated Raman scattering factors of total symmetric modes for the pyridine-metal complexes indicate that the bonding interaction influences the relative Raman intensity of the vibrational modes. The <b>surface</b> <b>bonding</b> mechanism was analyzed on the basis of molecular orbital theory.

In the following study trichloroalkylsilanes of differing chain lengths were used as a surfactant, and the level of capping, <b>surface</b> <b>bonding</b> and size of the nanoparticles formed has been investigated. FTIR results show that the degree of alkyl capping for SiNPs with different capping layers was constant, although SiNPs bound with shorter chains display a much higher level of Si-O owing to the reaction of the ethanol used in the method with uncapped sites on the particle. SiNPs with longer chain length capping show a sharp Si-H peak on the FTIR, these were heated at reflux with the corresponding 1 -alkene to fully cap these particles, resulting in a reduction/disappearance of this peak with a minimal change in the intensity of the Si-O peak.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the study of {{aromatic}} and heteroaromatic thiol selfassembly on Au single crystal surfaces. A range of surface spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques have been used to investigate the formation of complex assemblies in terms of the types of surface intermediates formed, adsórbate orientation and the mechanism of adsorption from the gas and liquid phases. The self-assembly process is reviewed, with particular emphasis on aromatic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). The applicability of a range of surface sensitive probes to the characterisation of such assemblies, differences between adsorption from the gas phase and the liquid phase and limitations with respect to ex situ techniques are discussed. Initial work focused on an electrochemical and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigation of the self-assembly of heteroaromatic thiols, 2 - mercaptobenzothiazole and 2 -mercaptobenzimidazole, in terms of their <b>surface</b> <b>bonding</b> and molecular orientation following adsorption from the liquid and vapour phases, with additional information on substrate contamination effects. The structural and behavioural complexities of the heteroaromatic thiols motivated us to revert to the simplest aromatic thiol, benzenethiol.

For a <b>surface</b> <b>bonded</b> optical fiber sensor, the measuring sensitivity is strongly dependent on the bonding characteristics which include the protective coating, adhesive layer and the bonding length.

In this investigation, an analytical expression of the thermal strain and stress in the optical fiber is presented. The theoretical predictions are validated using the finite element method.
