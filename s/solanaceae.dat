5|$|In 1991 a {{research}} {{group led by}} Clarence A. Ryan, isolated an 18 amino acid polypeptide from tomato leaves that induced the production of protease inhibitor proteins (PIs) in response to wounding. Experiments using synthetic radio-labelled forms of the polypeptide demonstrated that {{it was able to}} travel systemically through the plant and induce PI production in unwounded leaves. Because of the systemic nature of the wounding signal, it was named systemin, it was the first polypeptide found to function as a hormone in plants. mRNA encoding for systemin is found in all tissues of the plant except the roots. Later studies identified homologs of tomato systemin in other members of the <b>Solanaceae</b> including potato, black nightshade and bell pepper. Systemins have only been identified in the Solaneae subtribe of the <b>Solanaceae,</b> but other members of the family, such as tobacco, also respond to wounding by systemically producing protease inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, biologically active hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were {{isolated}} from tobacco which activated {{the production of}} protease inhibitors {{in a similar way}} to systemin in tomatoes. Although they are structurally unrelated to systemins, their similar function resulted in them being named hydroxyproline-rich systemins (HypSys). Following the initial discovery other HypSys peptides were found in tomato, Petunia and black nightshade. In 2007, HypSys were found outside the <b>Solanaceae,</b> in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and sequence analysis identified HypSys analogs in poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and coffee (Coffea canephora). Systemins are highly conserved between species, whereas HypSys are more divergent but all contain a conserved proline or hydroxyproline-rich central domain.|$|E
5|$|Many natural poisons act as {{neurotoxins}} {{that can}} cause paralysis leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the <b>Solanaceae</b> family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} beetle have evolved {{immunity}} to insecticides. For example, the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is a destructive pest of potato plants. Its hosts include {{other members of}} the <b>Solanaceae,</b> such as nightshade, tomato, eggplant and capsicum, as well as the potato. Different populations have between them developed resistance to all major classes of insecticide. The Colorado potato beetle was evaluated as a tool of entomological warfare during World War II, the idea being to use the beetle and its larvae to damage the crops of enemy nations. Germany tested its Colorado potato beetle weaponisation program south of Frankfurt, releasing 54,000 beetles.|$|E
5|$|Systemin is a plant {{peptide hormone}} {{involved}} in the wound response in the <b>Solanaceae</b> family. It was the first plant hormone that was {{proven to be a}} peptide having been isolated from tomato leaves in 1991 by a group led by Clarence A. Ryan. Since then other peptides, with similar functions have been identified in tomato and outside of the <b>Solanaceae.</b> Hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were found in tobacco in 2001 and AtPEPs (Arabidopsis thaliana Plant Elicitor Peptides) were found in Arabidopsis thaliana in 2006. Their precursors are found both in the cytoplasm and cell walls of plant cells, upon insect damage, the precursors are processed to produce one or more mature peptides. The receptor for systemin was first thought to be the same as the brassinolide receptor but this is now uncertain. The signal transduction processes that occur after the peptides bind are similar to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. Early experiments showed that systemin travelled around the plant after insects had damaged the plant, activating systemic acquired resistance, now it is thought that it increases the production of jasmonic acid causing the same result. The main function of systemins is to coordinate defensive responses against insect herbivores but they also affect plant development. Systemin induces the production of protease inhibitors which protect against insect herbivores, other peptides activate defensins and modify root growth. They have also been shown to affect plants' responses to salt stress and UV radiation. AtPEPs have been shown to affect resistance against oomycetes and may allow A. thaliana to distinguish between different pathogens. In Nicotiana attenuata, some of the peptides have stopped being involved in defensive roles and instead affect flower morphology.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{diversity}} is {{an aspect of}} biodiversity important for food security. The loss of bio{{diversity is}} considered one of today’s most serious environmental concerns by the Food and Agriculture Organization. If current trends persist, as many as half of all plant species could face extinction. Among the many threatened species are wild relatives of our crops – the wild and weedy cousins of domesticated plants that possess valuable traits for crop breeding, such as pest and disease resistance. Some 6% of wild relatives of cereal crops such as wheat, maize, rice, and sorghum are under threat, as are 18% of legumes (Fabaceae), the wild relatives of beans, peas and lentils, and 13% of species within the botanical family (<b>Solanaceae)</b> that includes potato, tomato, eggplant (aubergine), and peppers (Capsicum). In 2016, 29% of wild relative plant species were completely missing from the world’s genebanks, with a further 24% represented by fewer than 10 samples. Over 70% of all crop wild relative species worldwide were in urgent need of further collecting to improve their representation in genebanks, and over 95% were insufficiently represented with regard to the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. While the most critical priorities for further collecting were found in the Mediterranean and Near East, Western and Southern Europe, Southeast and East Asia, and South America, crop wild relatives insufficiently represented in genebanks are distributed across almost all countries worldwide.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} study, eighty-four Hy-Line W 36 laying hens in two {{experiments}} were distributed in 7 treatments with 3 replicates of four hens each. Each treatment, hens received 3 dipping/ 2 min every 48 h. Residual activity {{was done by}} counting lice one month after dipping. Treated hens with no live lice were reinfested with 20 lice and repeated during three months. In experiment one, aqueous suspensions of three plant extracts were tested as dips for control of MS lice: a) Neem (Azadirachta indica) 500 ppm; b) Ruda (Ruta graveolens) 11, 700 ppm; or c) <b>Solanacea</b> (Ardisia <b>solanacea)</b> 50, 000 ppm; d) Negative Control (water). After the first dipping, a significant difference (p< 0. 05) {{in the number of}} dead lice were observed in the hens that received Neem (84. 1 %) or <b>Solanacea</b> (98. 1 %), however, after the second and third dipping, all treated groups showed {{a significant increase in the}} number of dead lice compared with the control. Average after the 3 dips was: Neem (93. 6 %); Ruda (85. 2 %); <b>Solanacea</b> (98. 2 %); Control (49. 1 %).

50|$|The <b>solanaceas</b> {{include such}} {{important}} food species as the potato (Solanum tuberosum), the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the pepper (Capsicum annuum) and the aubergine or egg plant (Solanum melongena). Nicotiana tabacum, originally from South America, is now cultivated {{throughout the world}} to produce tobacco.Many <b>solanaceas</b> are important weeds {{in various parts of}} the world. Their importance lies in the fact that they can host pathogens or diseases of the cultivated plants, therefore their presence increases the loss of yield or the quality of the harvested product. An example of this can be seen with Acnistus arborescens and Browalia americana that host thrips, which cause damage to associated cultivated plants, and certain species of Datura that play host to various types of virus that are later transmitted to cultivated <b>solanaceas.</b> Some species of weeds such as, Solanum mauritianum in South Africa represent such serious ecological and economic problems that studies are being carried out with the objective of developing a biological control through the use of insects.|$|R
