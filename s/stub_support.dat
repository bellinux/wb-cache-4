Two pairs of bent quarter-wavelength <b>supporting</b> <b>stubs</b> were proposed to reduce the lateral dimension of the structure. A size reduction of 40 % was achieved by using the bent <b>supporting</b> <b>stubs</b> design as compared with a similar one with straight <b>supporting</b> <b>stubs</b> design. An average insertion loss of 0. 36 dB across the bandwidth of 28 - 48 GHz was achieved, with return loss of better than - 14 dB. The use of bent <b>supporting</b> <b>stubs</b> did not compromise its microwave performance. The component is, therefore, particularly appealing for integrated components such as complex couplers or Butler matrix, where overall size reduction (with no loss of performance) and cost saving can be substantial...|$|R

40|$|The Formula Hybrid senior {{project group}} was tasked with {{designing}} {{and building a}} drivetrain system for the Cal Poly Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Formula Hybrid (FHSAE) team. FHSAE gave customer requirements for performance and geometry for the drivetrain and the FHSAE rulebook has guidelines regarding safety requirements. The team chose {{to compete in the}} electric category of the 2012 FHSAE competition. After getting feedback from previous car performance and researching different powertrain options, the senior project team arrived at three conceptual ideas. Using a quality function deployment method, the senior project team chose the concept where two motors independently delivered power to the rear wheels through a chain and sprocket system. Additionally, an electronic control system would handle power delivery to each of the motors to insure proper vehicle operation. The main components of the final drivetrain design consists of: two DC electric motors, two chain/sprocket systems, two motor supports, two gear sprocket/brake rotor mounts, two axle stubs, one axle <b>stubs</b> central <b>support,</b> four constant velocity joints (CVJ’s), two half shafts, and bearings. The main components of the final drivetrain controls and data acquisition design consists of: 1 real-time controller with digital and analog inputs/outputs, and 2 motor controllers. Additionally, a 3 -axis accelerometer, a 3 axis-gyroscope, a steering wheel position sensor, and four wheel speed sensors were purchased with the intentions to implement a traction control and torque vectoring control system. The control algorithms were developed, but motor controller issues prevented actual implementation of these advanced control systems.

40|$|Cross-section {{classification}} {{is one of}} the {{key concepts}} in the design of metallic structures. Current design specifications for aluminium alloys, such as Eurocode 9 (EC 9), provide clear definitions and discrete design capacities for four different classes of cross-section. On the basis of substantial, recently generated experimental and numerical data on aluminium alloy cross-sections collected from the literature, the purpose of the present study is to re-evaluate the slenderness limits that define these classes. A total of approximately 900 relevant data points have been gathered, covering <b>stub</b> columns, simply <b>supported</b> beams and continuous beams; the cross-section types include square and rectangular hollow sections (SHS/RHS) with and without internal stiffeners, I-sections, channels and angles. The members were extruded from a variety of aluminium alloy tempers with a wide range of yield and ultimate strengths. Following analysis of the available data, the slenderness limits in EC 9 have been re-assessed, and new slenderness limits in the EC 9 framework are proposed. In addition, the full cross-section slenderness allowing for element interaction, which is utilised in the direct strength method (DSM) and the continuous strength method (CSM) has been considered as the slenderness parameter in a new classification framework. Corresponding slenderness limits, together with a compatible effective thickness formula for Class 4 sections, are proposed. The suitability of the proposed limits has been demonstrated for the conventional design methods in EC 9, as well as the alternative methods in Annexes F and H of EC 9...|$|R
40|$|Several {{superstructure}} design methodologies {{have been}} developed for low volume road bridges by the Iowa State University Bridge Engineering Center. However, to date no standard abutment designs {{have been developed}}. Thus, there was a need to establish an easy to use design methodology in addition to generating generic abutment standards and other design aids for the more common substructure systems used in Iowa. The final report for this project consists of three volumes. The first volume (this volume) summarizes the research completed in this project. A survey of the Iowa County Engineers was conducted from which it was determined that while most counties use similar types of abutments, only 17 percent use some type of standard abutment designs or plans. A literature review revealed several possible alternative abutment systems for future use on low volume road bridges in addition to two separate substructure lateral load analysis methods. These consisted of a linear and a non-linear method. The linear analysis method was used for this project due to its relative simplicity and the relative accuracy of the maximum pile moment when compared to values obtained from the more complex non-linear analysis method. The resulting design methodology was developed for single span <b>stub</b> abutments <b>supported</b> on steel or timber piles with a bridge span length ranging from 20 to 90 ft and roadway widths of 24 and 30 ft. However, other roadway widths can be designed using the foundation design template provided. The backwall height is limited to a range of 6 to 12 ft, and the soil type is classified as cohesive or cohesionless. The design methodology was developed using the guidelines specified by the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials Standard Specifications, the Iowa Department of Transportation Bridge Design Manual, and the National Design Specifications for Wood Construction. The second volume introduces and outlines the use of the various design aids developed for this project. Charts for determining dead and live gravity loads based on the roadway width, span length, and superstructure type are provided. A foundation design template was developed in which the engineer can check a substructure design by inputting basic bridge site information. Tables published by the Iowa Department of Transportation that provide values for estimating pile friction and end bearing for different combinations of soils and pile types are also included. Generic standard abutment plans were developed for which the engineer can provide necessary bridge site information in the spaces provided. These tools enable engineers to design and detail county bridge substructures more efficiently. The third volume provides two sets of calculations that demonstrate the application of the substructure design methodology developed in this project. These calculations also verify the accuracy of the foundation design template. The printouts from the foundation design template are provided {{at the end of each}} example. Also several tables provide various foundation details for a pre-cast double tee superstructure with different combinations of soil type, backwall height, and pile type...|$|R
