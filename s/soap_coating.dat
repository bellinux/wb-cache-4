The benchmark was carried out in the framework of the European project VIF-CA "Virtual Intelligent Forging" with the participation of five research laboratories. In this work, an AISI 1010 low carbon steel bar with phosphate and <b>soap</b> <b>coating</b> was chosen as the reference material. A real industrial extrusion was chosen as reference process to obtain the process conditions under which friction has to be evaluated. Different friction tests, including forward extrusion, double-cup extrusion, upsetting-sliding test and T-shape compression, were set-up and carried out to evaluate the friction conditions. According to friction factors and friction stresses obtained through these tests, the contact pressure and surface expansion ratio have significant effects on friction. Therefore, in order to choose a suitable friction test for a given forging operation, the contact pressure and surface expansion ratio of the chosen friction test and the ones of the analysed industrial operation should be as similar as possible...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFriction {{plays an}} {{important}} role in metal forming, and numerical simulation of forging processes requires precise informations about the material properties and the value of the friction factor m or coefficient μ. This paper describes the T-shape compression, a new friction testing method by combined compression and extrusion of a cylinder between a flat punch and a V-grooved die. It can realize actual cold forging condition and allows measuring the friction on the cylindrical surface of the billet during forging process. The results of experiments and simulations show that the stroke-load curve and the height of the extruded part are both sensitive to friction. In order to obtain the highest sensitivity to friction, a FE parametric study of this test has been performed: it indicates that small corner radius and V-groove angle in the die should be chosen. Two commercial FE codes, FORGE 3 D and ABAQUS, were used and provided very similar results for a given friction condition. Low carbon steel drawn bar with phosphate and <b>soap</b> <b>coating</b> was chosen as specimens. Friction tests with three different lubrication conditions (solid coating, oil and oil + solid coating) were carried out, and then friction factor m and friction coefficient μ were determined by using experimental results and the calibration by numerical simulation of T-shape compression test...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{electrolytic}} reduction of corroded lead objects and the application, characterization and testing of a protective lead <b>soap</b> <b>coating</b> Bart SCHOTTE Lead objects exposed to the atmosphere or buried are known to corrode slightly. However, lead corrodes severely in humid environments, and, more specifically, {{in the presence of}} organic acids. This accelerated degradation, commonly referred to as active corrosion, takes place e. g. in display cases of museums and on organ pipes in churches: the objects readily loose mechanical stability and their original surface details. If the process is not stabilized, all details and even the entire artefact could be lost through complete disintegration. A possible treatment to stabilize and conserve active corroded lead is an electrochemical reduction. In this work we have tried to shed some light onto the process. First of all, a fundamental study was performed to understand the mechanism of the ongoing reduction and how it affects the profile of the corresponding reduction curve. In a second part, we focused on the evaluation of the treatment, related to the chemical and morphological changes of the lead artefacts. Finally, we studied the efficiency of the treatment on corroded lead alloys. Therefore, lead and lead alloys, including lead-tin, lead-antimony and lead-bismuth were artificially corroded by vapours of formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid and acetaldehyde at different concentration levels. Consequently, the electrolytic reduction of the corroded coupons was studied to evaluate the effects of the alloying elements. In this work, we studied the application of lead decanoate, deposited by immersion in sodium decanoate solutions. We focused on the lead decanoate layer growth in situ using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, in order to obtain insights in the protection and growth properties. The preparation of decanoate solutions was investigated and resulted in the establishment of a protocol for a solution that produces rigid coatings. Using this solution, we studied the lead decanoate surface coverage on a basis of solid/liquid contact angle measurements at regular time intervals during treatment. In addition, we monitored the coating resistance during application by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and studied effects of stirring and of the layer thickness of the liquid phase to determine most efficient application conditions...|$|E

For soap {{in the form of}} a puck or bar, the brush is first soaked in water and then swirled vigorously over the surface of the soap, causing moist <b>soap</b> to <b>coat</b> the brush's bristles.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of thin liquid films during their generation from a surfactant solution is in-vestigated through comparison between a hydrodynamic model including surface elasticity and experiments. “Twin ” models are proposed {{to describe the}} coating of films onto a solid plate (Landau-Levich-Derjaguin configuration) as well as soap film pulling (Frankel config-uration). Experimental data from the literature are successfully fitted using the models, surface elasticity being the only adjustable parameter. For a given surfactant solution, the analyses of <b>soap</b> and <b>coated</b> films both yield the same value for surface elasticity. Con-versely, this shows that Frankel- or Landau-Levich-like experiments {{can be used in}} practice as surface rheometers to determine the numerical value of the surface elasticity of a solution, especially for values lower than those measurable by classical devices.

50|$|The Stabyhoun {{does not}} require special care apart from regular {{brushing}} to minimize tangling. The dogs moult (shed) twice a year, and thorough brushing helps the process of shedding. Without brushing, Stabyhoun hair can get tangled and matted {{in the manner of}} dreadlocks. The hair behind the ears is particularly susceptible to tangling and matting. Washing with soap should be avoided when possible because <b>soap</b> strips the <b>coat</b> of its natural oils and shine. The Stabyhoun coat will naturally rid itself of dirt and mud. After a swim the dog is usually clean and dry in a matter of hours.|$|R
40|$|Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) seed is {{the oldest}} oil seed crop and the highest content of fats and oils among other seeds oil. The fats and oils of sesame contain good {{proteins}} and vitamins for body health and food. This research presents the study of <b>soap</b> from undehulled (<b>coated)</b> and dehulled sesame seed oil which derived from a soxhlet extraction method. Different treats of sesame seed were exposed to experiment that determine the value of physiochemical, such as saponification value (SV), acid value (AV), iodine value (IV), free fatty acid value (FFA) and peroxide value (PV). Sesame oils were saponified with two types of alkali which sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) to give a solid and liquid soap, respectively. The analysis of the soap was carried out to determine the pH value, foam height, colour in solution, and solubility in water and foam structure. Further analysis of the soap was testing with a dirty cloth, hand washing and laboratory glassware. Results from the analysis were exposed that sesame seed can produce either solid or liquid soap with high of conditioning agent. Dehulled oil has saponification value of 186. 5 mg KOH/ g, acid value of 109. 4 g I 2 / 100 g, peroxide value of 14. 8 meq H 2 O 2 /g, and free fatty acid value of 49. 3 % (oleic) and undehulled seed oil has values 210. 4 mg KOH/ g, 1. 34 g I 2 / 100 g, 106. 3 meq H 2 O 2 /g, 8 and 39. 48 % (Oleic), respectively. In conclusion, {{the objective of this}} study is achieved where sesame seed soap can be established, whether from undehulled or dehulled oil. In future, sesame oil is potentially to use as an oil foundation in making soa...|$|R
