They remained in service until late 1983, when they were replaced by the more modern Type 80 (Aquarius class). In 1962, the units of the class were upgraded with an electric generator, radars and radios, and had their armament upgraded: the Type 41 anti-tank rifle at the bow {{was replaced by a}} 20mm autocannon, and the twin anti-air MG 38 machine guns at the stern were replaced by an MG 51 machine gun.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method to measure {{two-dimensional}} velocity fields inside an artificial foam-like porous structure using particle image velocimetry and a refractive index matching technique to avoid optical distortion. The porous structure is manufactured by stereolithography with the epoxy resin WaterShed® XC 11122 as solid material, and anisole is used as refractive index-matched fluid. It {{was found that the}} direction of build-up of the stereolithographic structure plays an important role for the quality of the recorded images. The velocity fields measured in this study and the turbulent statistics derived thereof allow to characterize the hydrodynamic performance of the artificial foam-like structure and clarify the mechanisms of mixing. Results from this study compare well to results from a large eddy simulation reported by Hutter et al.

40|$|Background: A component-based {{approach}} is introduced for fast and flexible solution of parameter-dependent symmetric eigenproblems. Methods: Considering a generalized eigenproblem with symmetric stiffness and mass operators, we start by introducing a “ σ-shifted” eigenproblem where {{the left hand}} side operator corresponds to an equilibrium between the stiffness operator and a weighted mass operator, with weight-parameter σ> 0. Assuming that σ=λ n > 0, the nth real positive eigenvalue of the original eigenproblem, then the shifted eigenproblem reduces to the solution of a homogeneous linear problem. In this context, we can apply the static condensation reduced basis element (SCRBE) method, a domain synthesis approach with reduced basis (RB) approximation at the intradomain level to populate a Schur complement at the interdomain level. In the Offline stage, for a library of archetype subdomains we train RB spaces {{for a family of}} linear problems; these linear problems correspond to various equilibriums between the stiffness operator and the weighted mass operator. In the Online stage we assemble instantiated subdomains and perform static condensation to obtain the “ σ-shifted” eigenproblem for the full system. We then perform a direct search to find the values of σ that yield singular systems, corresponding to the eigenvalues of the original eigenproblem. Results: We provide eigenvalue a posteriori error estimators and we present various numerical results to demonstrate the accuracy, flexibility and computational efficiency of our approach. Conclusions: We are able to obtain large speed and memory improvements compared to a classical Finite Element Method (FEM), making our method very suitable for large models commonly considered in an engineering context.

5000|$|Heizer's latest project, Levitated Mass (2012), was for LACMA. He {{tried to}} build it in 1969 with a smaller boulder, but the crane {{attempting}} to lift it snapped. It was not until 2005 that he discovered an appropriate boulder, when a routine blast at Stone Valley Quarry in Riverside County, California, produced the piece he had imagined, and the project started coming together. LACMA's director Michael Govan first visited the site in 1994 as director of Dia:Beacon. Since then, Govan has become Heizer's greatest ally in the art world, raising $10 million from private donors to realize Levitated Mass and serving as {{a spokesman for the}} artist. It took eleven nights, from February 28 to March 10, 2012, to move the 340-ton rock from Jurupa Valley to the museum. The granite boulder (21.5 feet wide and 21.5 feet high) is installed atop a 456-foot-long trench, which allows people to walk under it. The long channel, descending to a depth of 15 feet, is encircled by a lozenge-shaped line of weathering steel embedded in the earth and rusting to a velvety brown. The installation is situated in a field of polished concrete slices, set at a slight angle between the Resnick Pavilion and Sixth Street. Heizer opened the exhibit on June 24, 2012. A feature documentary, also named [...] "Levitated Mass," [...] was directed and edited by the filmmaker Doug Pray. It details the making of the sculpture as it relates to Heizer’s career, while portraying the boulder's 105-mile journey through Los Angeles and the public’s reaction to its installation. The film premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival in June 2013 and opened theatrically at the Landmark's Nuart Theater in Los Angeles, CA on September 5, 2014.

40|$|Controlling {{government}} is a primary focus of the politico-economic literature. Recently, various political institutions have been analyzed from this perspective, most importantly balanced budget rules, fiscal federalism, and direct democracy. However, one type of institution has been neglected so far: elected competitors to the government. Such institutional competition {{between the government and}} an independent agency {{can be found at the}} Swiss local level, where finance Commissions compete with the government. In some parts of <b>Switzerland,</b> local finance <b>commissions</b> can ex ante criticize government projects and bring alternative policy proposals onto the political agenda, which are then voted on by the citizens. Thus, they become strong competitors to the government. We econometrically investigate this institutional setting by comparing the 26 Swiss cantons.

During the Occupation, Antoine Pinay remained mayor of Saint-Chamond, although he had been urged by General Georges to move to Algiers, in order to better protect the residents of this city. Yet, trying to associate him with Vichy is inappropriate : he resigned from the Conseil National within a few months and refused any official position with the Vichy regime, such as the préfecture de l'Hérault offered by Laval. Besides, he gave several hundreds of identity papers to help Jews and Résistance members flee from France to Algiers or <b>Switzerland.</b> An official <b>commission</b> in 1946 recognized his long lasting opposition to the Nazis and the help he gave to the Résistance and let him totally free of any charge.|$|R

Carline's brother Richard was attracted and took Preece dining and dancing, until he understood the nature of her relationship with Hepworth. The Hepworths lost their fortune in the Great Depression, and from 1930, Preece and Hepworth were struggling to make mortgage payments. Spencer introduced Preece to his extensive art-world contacts. In May 1933, Spencer's cosmopolitan patron, Edward Beddington-Behrens invited Preece to travel with Stanley to <b>Switzerland</b> for a <b>commission</b> (Preece spoke fluent French, while Stanley spoke none). In 1933, Preece first modelled for Spencer, sitting for Portrait of Patricia Preece. [...] By 1934, Spencer was concerned about Preece's finances and deteriorating health. He suggested that Preece and Hepworth move into {{the top floor of}} his house, but they did not do so. Carline was also concerned about their artist friends but was already suspicious of Spencer's relationship with Preece. Nevertheless, in 1934, Spencer persuaded Carline to paint a portrait of Preece. The resulting image shows both Carline's ambivalent feelings about Preece and the latter's change in demeanour since her more lighthearted days of financial independence.|$|R
