5|$|The Highlanders' {{franchise}} area {{consists of}} the region controlled by the North Otago, Otago and Southland Rugby Unions. Both Otago and Southland compete in the semi-professional ITM Cup (formerly the Air New Zealand Cup), and North Otago in the amateur Heartland Championship. However, given Otago and Southland's lack of success in the ITM Cup, the Highlanders have often looked further afield to sign players from. This {{is a reflection of}} Otago's historically large influx of people from distant lands during the early <b>settlement</b> <b>period,</b> particularly from the Celtic countries of Scotland and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Gaelic {{continued}} to exist as a spoken language in the southern Hebrides throughout the Norse <b>settlement</b> <b>period,</b> but place-name evidence suggests it had a lowly status. The obliteration of pre-Norse names is almost total. There is little continuity of style between Pictish pottery {{in the north and}} that of the early Viking period. The similarities that do exist suggests the later pots may have been made by Norse who had settled in Ireland, or by Irish slaves. In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials have been found on Arran, although not on Bute, and place-name evidence suggests a settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. There are numerous Manx Runestones and place names of Norse origin on the Isle of Man.|$|E

30|$|Fires were {{probably}} most prevalent {{during the late}} summer and fall months at Sagehen as inferred from the location of fire scars in the tree rings. The majority of fires where seasonality could be determined occurred during the latewood and dormant portions of the tree ring. The proportion of fires occurring during the earlywood section of the tree ring is higher than other study in the eastern Sierra Nevada during the pre-settlement and <b>settlement</b> <b>periods</b> (Taylor and Beaty 2005, Moody et al. 2006, Beaty and Taylor 2007). The higher proportion of growing season fires could {{have been caused by}} Native American burning, logging accidents, or opportunistic burning by sheep herders. Latewood and dormant season fire occurrence was dominant through the pre-settlement and <b>settlement</b> <b>periods</b> and suppression period fires mainly occurred during this season. The lack of early earlywood fires during both the <b>settlement</b> and suppression <b>periods</b> is possibly due to the loss of Native American burning in Sagehen. The effectiveness of suppression most likely eliminated fires burning during middle earlywood formation after 1923.|$|R

5|$|The Oregon Supreme Court traces {{its roots}} {{back to the}} early <b>settlement</b> <b>period</b> of Oregon Country. In 1841, pioneer Ewing Young died without an heir or will in the unorganized lands of what are now the states of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. In February of that year, {{settlers}} met at Champoeg to discuss the creation of a government, including a judiciary to deal with the execution of Young’s estate. Although the overall government plans fell through, the group of pioneers and mountain men did elect a Supreme Judge to exercise probate powers. The first judge was Dr. Ira L. Babcock, serving from February 18, 1841, to May 1, 1843.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>settlement</b> <b>period</b> {{the lands}} {{ruled by the}} incomers {{seem to have been}} {{fragmented}} into numerous tribal territories, but by the 7th century, when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available, these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, Kent and Sussex. Over the following centuries this process of political consolidation continued. The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia, which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence. In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex. Later in that century escalating attacks by the Danes culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England, overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia. Wessex under Alfred the Great was left as the only surviving English kingdom, and under his successors it steadily expanded {{at the expense of the}} kingdoms of the Danelaw. This brought about the political unification of England, first accomplished under Æthelstan in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by Eadred in 953. A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013 and again by his son Cnut in 1016, turning it into the centre of a short-lived North Sea Empire that also included Denmark and Norway. However the native royal dynasty was restored with the accession of Edward the Confessor in 1042.|$|E

25|$|According to Fischer, the {{foundation}} of American culture was formed from four mass migrations from four {{different regions of the}} British Isles by four distinct socio-religious groups. New England's earliest <b>settlement</b> <b>period</b> occurred between 1629-1640 when Puritans, mostly from East Anglia in England, settled there, forming the New England regional culture. The next mass migration was of southern English cavaliers and their Irish and Scottish domestic servants to the Chesapeake Bay region between 1640-1675, producing the Southern American culture. Then, between 1675-1725, thousands of Irish, English and German Quakers, led by William Penn, settled in the Delaware Valley.|$|E
40|$|The {{duration}} of embryonic {{development and the}} planktonic stage of meroplanktonic species is highly temperature dependent and thus the seasonal temperature oscillations of temperate regions greatly affect the patterns of hatching and benthic settlement. Based on data from the literature on embryonic development and planktonic {{duration of}} Octopus vulgaris (common octopus) in relation to temperature, and on observed temperature patterns, several models of hatching and settlement patterns were created. There was a good fit between observed settlement patterns and model predictions. Based on these models we concluded that in temperate regions: (1) when temperature is increasing (from early spring to mid summer) the hatching and <b>settlement</b> <b>periods</b> tend to shorten, while when the temperature is decreasing (during autumn) the hatching and <b>settlement</b> <b>periods</b> tend to lengthen; (2) hatching and settlement peaks are narrower and more intense than a spring spawning peak but wider and less intense than an autumn spawning peak; (3) at lower latitudes, hatching and settlement patterns tend to follow the spawning pattern more closely, (4) the periodic temperature pattern of temperate areas {{has the potential to}} cause a convergence of hatching during spring...|$|R

30|$|Trends in growth, {{reduction}} and stagnation of population in settlements from previous population census {{show that the}} number of settlements that have shown negative trend of the population has grown consistently, and opposition to this category are settlements that have increased the number of population, while settlements with stagnation trend growth until the census of 1961, then decline. Settlements with negative population trend are as follows; from 144 <b>settlements</b> in the <b>period</b> 1948 – 1953; 198 <b>settlements</b> in the <b>period</b> 1953 – 1961; 283 settlements in 1961 – 1971; 405 <b>settlements</b> in the <b>period</b> 1971 – 1981; and 800 <b>settlements</b> in the <b>period</b> 1981 – 2011.

The reasons for this are mainly the difficult conditions of life, the very limited number of social services and utilities, extreme low level of capital investment in infrastructure, the lack of prospects in the primary sector, the opportunity to migrate to settlements that lies in plains with plenty arable land and cities, and as well as migration abroad in order to ensure the welfare and long-term perspective for a family because of the state of frozen conflict-war in Kosovo during 1989 – 1999.
