2500|$|In Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Delaware v. Kassel, 612 F.2d 1064 (8th Cir. 1979), aff’d, 450 U.S. 662 (1981), Iowa’s {{prohibition}} of extra-long <b>semitrailer</b> trucks was alleged to unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce, {{in violation of}} {{what is known as the}} dormant Commerce Clause. [...] the court upheld the claim and struck down the requirement. [...] In the court’s opinion, Judge Heaney reasoned that, while “some burdening of interstate commerce will be tolerated” for the sake of safety, The Iowa regulation failed because it burdened interstate commerce and failed to directly protect a state safety interest. [...] Two years later, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed this ruling.|$|E
2500|$|Jack {{pulls out}} a car from his garage and begins the race. After {{escaping}} from San Francisco by driving off the unfinished replacement span of the Eastern San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, Jack passes through Altamont Pass, Yosemite National Park, and Death Valley, before making it to Las Vegas in the top 150. Upon arrival, two female team racers interrogate him about his skills, and he is nearly apprehended after police shut down the city. However, he manages to escape out of Fremont Street, but is nearly crushed by a <b>semitrailer</b> truck. He manages to acquire a new vehicle, and heads to Chicago {{to make it in}} the top 50. On the way, he passes through the desert and up into the Rocky Mountains, where a one-on-one race against an opponent unfolds as the mountain slopes are detonated with dynamite to remove excess snow for the year. He races through Denver and the Badlands and across the Mississippi River, and upon arrival in Chicago, Marcus Blackwell, Jack's biggest rival and the main antagonist of the game, uses his connections with the mob to organize a [...] "welcome committee". Jack is then forced out of his car and pursued on foot by the mob's machine gun-mounted helicopter. After Jack temporarily escapes from the helicopter, he acquires a stolen police car, but is pursued by the helicopter again down Lower Wacker Drive and along the river. He tries to stay out of the spotlight of the helicopter to avoid getting the vehicle shot and destroyed, but ends up crashing in a train yard. Jack escapes from the overturned police car seconds before a freight train runs it down. Escaping Chicago and entering Cleveland, he drives through an industrial train yard filled with high explosives, trying to escape the mob. Crashing through the window of a warehouse, Jack wrecks the helicopter by slamming into its tail and sending it into the side of a building. After this, Jack is directed to and see a man named Uri for a new car. On the final leg to New York, Jack races through rural Pennsylvania, the Appalachians and Big Run State Park, defeating the final racers in the process. Jack makes it to New York in the top 2, passing through New Jersey. He races Marcus Blackwell (who drives a heavily modified Tier 6 Aston Martin One-77) through the crowded morning streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn, and on the final stretch Marcus is killed after he flips his car. As a result, Jack wins The Run and claims the $25,000,000 jackpot.|$|E

40|$|Special report"This {{report is}} an {{investigation}} into the safety profile of work-related trucks which includes dump, garbage/refuse, tow/wrecker, cement mixer, utility, and many other single unit vocational trucks. Statistics are presented comparing work trucks to tractor <b>semitrailers,</b> straight truck vans, and passenger cars. Five years (1997 - 2000, 2002) of fatal crash counts are taken from the Trucks Involved in Fatal Accidents database. Fatal crash counts in 2002 for passenger cars are derived from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System data file. Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data for trucks are taken from the 2002 Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey, while VMT data for passenger cars are derived from reports published by the Federal Highway Administration. Crash involvement rates per 100 million VMT are calculated and compared among different vehicle types. In addition, fatal crash statistics are presented comparing work trucks, straight truck vans, tractor <b>semitrailers,</b> and passenger cars with respect to road and environment characteristics, vehicle characteristics, and driver characteristics. Based on VIUS VMT, the average annual crash involvement rate for all trucks (class 3 and above) was 3. 54. Dump trucks had the highest crash involvement rate (5. 96). The rate for garbage/refuse trucks was 5. 12, while the rate for tractor <b>semitrailers</b> was 3. 63. Straight truck vans had one of the lowest rates (2. 09). While fatal crash involvement rates for some of the work trucks appear to be high, aggregated rates do {{not take into account the}} kinds of roads that work trucks typically traveled on. Dump trucks accumulated 80 % of travel on local trips (50 miles or less), while <b>semitrailers</b> accumulated only 15. 8 % of travel on local trips. After stratification by trip type, it is shown that rates for many work trucks are comparable to, and in some cases lower than, the rate for <b>semitrailers.</b> On trips greater than 50 miles the rates for dump trucks and garbage/refuse trucks were 2. 90 and 1. 90, respectively, while the rate for <b>semitrailers</b> was 3. 2...|$|R

5000|$|A large {{proportion}} of a semitrailer's weight {{is supported by a}} tractor unit, or a detachable front-axle assembly known as a dolly, or the tail of another trailer. A <b>semitrailer</b> is normally equipped with landing gear (legs which can be lowered) to support it when it is uncoupled. Many semitrailers have wheels that are capable of being totally dismounted and are also relocatable (repositionable) to better distribute load to bearing wheel weight factors. Semitrailers are more popular for transport than full trailers, which have both front and rear axles. Ease of backing is cited as one of the semi's chief advantages.
