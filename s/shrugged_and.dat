25|$|On {{the morning}} of 26 August, while the BEF II Corps was engaged at the Battle of Le Cateau, Sir John French had a hostile meeting with Joffre and Lanrezac at Saint-Quentin. Lanrezac was only reluctantly persuaded by {{his chief of staff}} to attend, and before Joffre’s arrival he was {{observed}} loudly criticising both GQG and the BEF, making a poor impression on the junior officer who witnessed it. Lanrezac had his pince nez hanging from his ear “like a pair of cherries” and gave the impression of being bored whilst Joffre was speaking. However, he assured Joffre that Fifth Army would be ready to counterattack {{as soon as he was}} out into open country where he could use his artillery. French complained of Lanrezac’s behaviour, to which Lanrezac <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> gave a vague and academic reply. Joffre stayed for lunch (Lanrezac declined to do so), at which the atmosphere improved, as Joffre confessed that he too was dissatisfied with Lanrezac.|$|E
500|$|Ayn Rand ( [...] ; born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum , – March 6, 1982) was a Russian-American novelist, philosopher, playwright, and screenwriter. She {{is known}} for her two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas <b>Shrugged,</b> <b>and</b> for {{developing}} a philosophical system she called Objectivism. Educated in Russia, {{she moved to the}} United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935–1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead.|$|E

500|$|Recording {{began on}} 7 October 1996 at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London. Morris {{described}} {{the first week}} as [...] "fucking awful", and suggested to Noel that they abandon the session: [...] "He just <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> {{said it would be}} all right. So on we went." [...] Liam was under heavy tabloid focus at the time, and on 9 November 1996 was arrested and cautioned for cocaine possession following a bender at the Q Awards. A media frenzy ensued, and the band's management made the decision to move to a studio less readily accessible to paparazzi.|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{felt that}} while the episode was [...] "still an {{entertaining}} half-hour, {{there was nothing to}} it that was incredibly memorable." [...] He said that Tracy Jordan was [...] "quickly becoming one of the more enjoyable aspects of the show". Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide felt that [...] "this outing fell a bit flat for [...] ". He thought that [...] "the best moment this week, by far, had to be that big, fat wink to Aaron Sorkin's Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (and West Wing, and Sports Night..., where Liz and Pete, upon realizing that they had traveled in a small circle {{over the course of a}} banter exchange, <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> said, 'Nice walk-and-talk', and then bumped fists. Nice." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} its initial publication, The Fountainhead has received relatively little attention from literary critics. Assessing the novel's legacy, philosopher Douglas Den Uyl described The Fountainhead as relatively neglected compared to her later novel, Atlas <b>Shrugged,</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "our problem is to find those topics that arise clearly with The Fountainhead and yet do not force us to read it simply {{through the eyes of}} Atlas Shrugged." [...] Among critics who have addressed it, some consider The Fountainhead to be Rand's best novel, although in some cases this assessment is tempered by an overall negative judgment of Rand's writings. Purely negative evaluations have also continued; a 2011 overview of American literature said [...] "mainstream literary culture dismissed [...] in the 1940s and continues to dismiss it".|$|E

500|$|As {{members of}} the Round Table moved into ventures outside New York City, inevitably the group drifted apart. By the early 1930s the Vicious Circle was broken. Edna Ferber said she {{realized}} it when {{she arrived at the}} Rose Room for lunch one day in 1932 and found the group's table occupied by a family from Kansas. Frank Case was asked what happened to the group. He <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> replied, [...] "What became of the reservoir at Fifth Avenue and Forty-Second Street? These things do not last forever." [...] Some {{members of the}} group remained friends after its dissolution. Parker and Benchley in particular remained close up until his death in 1945, although her political leanings did strain their relationship. Others, as the group itself would come to understand when it gathered following Woollcott's death in 1943, simply realized that they had nothing to say to one another.|$|E
500|$|Patton {{arrived at}} the {{hospital}} the same day, accompanied {{by a number of}} medical officers, as part of his tour of the U.S. II Corps troops. He spoke to some patients in the hospital, commending the physically wounded. He then approached Kuhl, who {{did not appear to be}} physically injured. Kuhl was sitting slouched on a stool midway through a tent ward filled with injured soldiers. When Patton asked Kuhl where he was hurt, Kuhl reportedly <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> replied that he was [...] "nervous" [...] rather than wounded, adding, [...] "I guess I can't take it." [...] Patton [...] "immediately flared up," [...] slapped Kuhl across the chin with his gloves, then grabbed him by the collar and dragged him to the tent entrance. He shoved him out of the tent with a kick to his backside. Yelling [...] "Don't admit this son of a bitch", Patton demanded that Kuhl be sent back to the front, adding, [...] "You hear me, you gutless bastard? You're going back to the front." ...|$|E
500|$|Rand {{described}} Night of January 16th as [...] "a sense-of-life play". She did {{not want}} its events to be taken literally, but {{to be understood as}} a representation of different ways of approaching life. Andre represents an ambitious, confident, non-conformist approach to life, while the prosecution witnesses represent conformity, envy of success, and the desire for power over others. Rand believed the jury's decision at each performance revealed the attitude of the jurors towards these two conflicting senses of life. Rand supported individualism and considered Andre [...] "not guilty". She said she wanted the play to convey the viewpoint: [...] "Your life, your achievement, your happiness, [...] are of paramount importance. Live up to your highest vision of yourself no matter what the circumstances you might encounter. An exalted view of self-esteem is man's most admirable quality". She said the play [...] "is not a philosophical treatise on morality" [...] and represents this view only in a basic way. Rand would later expound an explicit philosophy, which she called [...] "Objectivism", particularly in her 1957 novel Atlas <b>Shrugged</b> <b>and</b> in non-fiction essays, but Night of January 16th predates these more philosophical works.|$|E

He once threw his hat down on the pitch in frustration at his inability to dismiss the obdurate batsman Tom Walker, known as [...] "Old Everlasting". Beauclerk called Walker a [...] "confounded old beast" [...] but, when Walker was asked about it afterwards, he <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> said: [...] "I don't care what he says".|$|E
2500|$|Gein's {{house and}} {{property}} {{were scheduled to}} be auctioned March 30, 1958, amid rumors the house {{was to become a}} tourist attraction. On March 27, the house was destroyed by fire. Arson was suspected, but the cause was never officially determined. When Gein learned of the incident while in detention, he <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "Just as well." [...] Gein's car, which he used to haul the bodies of his victims, was sold at public auction for $760 to carnival sideshow operator Bunny Gibbons.

Moore {{said that he was}} vaguely familiar with the film, and then jokingly said he thought that Viggo Mortensen should be portraying him.

[...] Asked {{how he felt about}} himself in the years since, he said, [...] "Like I always felt ... had no feeling. If you're asking me if I felt sorry, no."

2500|$|Rand's self-identified {{literary}} influences include Victor Hugo, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Edmond Rostand, and O. Henry. In addition, Justin Raimondo {{has observed}} similarities between Atlas <b>Shrugged</b> <b>and</b> the 1922 novel The Driver, written by Garet Garrett, which concerns an idealized industrialist named Henry Galt, {{who is a}} transcontinental railway owner trying to improve the world and fighting against government and socialism. In contrast, Chris Matthew Sciabarra found Raimondo's [...] "claims that Rand plagiarized... The Driver" [...] to be [...] "unsupported", and Stephan Kinsella doubts that Rand was in any way influenced by Garrett. Writer Bruce Ramsey said both novels [...] "have to do with running railroads during an economic depression, and both suggest pro-capitalist {{ways in which the}} country might get out of the depression. But in plot, character, tone, and theme they are very different." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1986, Salerno {{was convicted}} {{on charges of}} murder and {{racketeering}} and sentenced to 100 years in prison along with top members of the other Five Families in {{what was called the}} Mafia Commission Trial. Genovese family informant Vincent Cafaro revealed to the FBI during the trial that Salerno was just a figurehead; Gigante had been the real boss of the family since 1981. [...] Before then, the FBI had missed a number of clues that Gigante was the real boss. [...] For instance, FBI bugs caught several instances of mafiosi discussing how Gigante had ordered murders—under Mafia rules, a power solely reserved to the boss. [...] Most tellingly, an FBI bug captured a conversation in which Salerno and capo Matthew [...] "Matty the Horse" [...] Ianniello were reviewing a list of prospective candidates to be made in another family. Frustrated that the nicknames of the wannabes hadn't been included, Salerno <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "I'll leave this up to the boss." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, {{shortly after}} Salerno's {{conviction}} in the Commission Trial, Salerno's longtime right-hand man, Vincent [...] "The Fish" [...] Cafaro, told the FBI that Salerno {{was only a}} front for Gigante. [...] Cafaro, who had by this time turned informer, also revealed that the Genovese family had been keeping up this ruse since 1969. [...] However, investigators had missed several clues that Salerno wasn't the real boss before then. [...] Most tellingly, an FBI bug captured a conversation in which Salerno and capo Matthew [...] "Matty the Horse" [...] Ianniello were reviewing a list of prospective candidates {{to be made in}} another family. [...] Frustrated that the nicknames of the wannabes hadn't been included, Salerno <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "I'll leave this up to the boss"—a clear sign that he was not the real leader of the family. [...] Nonetheless, this revelation would not have been enough to endanger Salerno's conviction and sentence in the Commission Trial; he had been convicted of specific crimes and not merely of being a boss. In any event, his 70-year sentence in the separate racketeering trial would have assured that he would die in prison.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then <b>shrugged</b> <b>and</b> sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
