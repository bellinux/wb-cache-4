In 1995, Craii... was turned into an eponymous cinema production, directed by Mircea Veroiu. It starred Mircea Albulescu, Marius Bodochi, and Gheorghe Dinică. The book and its author were also the subject of one episode in a documentary series produced by journalist and political scientist Stelian Tănase, dealing {{with the history of}} Bucharest; titled București, strict secret ("Bucharest, Top Secret"), it was aired by Realitatea TV in 2007.|$|E
5|$|This system {{continued}} {{the tradition of}} having separate base units for geometrically related dimensions, e.g., mètre for lengths, are (100m2) for areas, <b>stère</b> (1m3) for dry capacities, and litre (1 dm3) for liquid capacities. The hectare, equal to a hundred ares, the area of a square 100 metres on a side (about 2.47 acres), is still in use. The early metric system included only a few prefixes from milli (one thousandth) to myria (ten thousand).|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Russian Revolution of 1905, <b>Stere</b> {{and a group}} of his {{followers}} returned to Bessarabia in order to encourage local Romanian sentiment during elections for the State Duma and zemstvos— according to <b>Stere,</b> the group had the tacit approval of the Conservative government. In parallel, <b>Stere</b> represented the Chișinău zemstvo as a lawyer in a civil lawsuit. They arrived at a time of conflict, when Black Hundreds activity was gaining momentum and peasant pressures in the countryside were meeting with resistance from reactionary politicians such as Vladimir Purishkevich and Pavel Krushevan. Initially, <b>Stere</b> doubled as a correspondent for PNL French language newspapers, signing them as C. Șercăleano.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1890s, {{he had begun}} making use of the Șărcăleanu alias in his polemic articles, which became a {{particular}} topic of dispute after his confrontation with Dioghenide (who first speculated that <b>Stere</b> {{was the author of}} Șărcăleanus articles). Dioghenide's supporters, editors of the newspaper Naționalul, consequently pressured <b>Stere</b> to indicate who Șărcăleanu was ("We wish to know him, does he wear sidelocks or is he a Judaisized Romanian?"). Similar calls were voiced by Vieața, who alleged that <b>Stere</b> himself was a Russian Jew.|$|E
25|$|Mille's group found {{a friend}} in Constantin <b>Stere,</b> by then a {{maverick}} member of the PNL, who began maneuvering against the PNL's right-wing from the inside. Managing a literary sheet {{put out by the}} pro-PNL Evenimentul, <b>Stere</b> supported Adevărul in its campaign for literary didacticism, and organized rallies of solidarity with the Bucharest socialists. This happened just as Toni was publishing satirical pieces targeting Evenimentul owner George A. Scorțescu, which left <b>Stere</b> in an awkward position. <b>Stere</b> was consequently accused by Evenimentul of being a spy and a tool for the Conservatives. The incidents were reviewed with caution by Adevărul, whose panelists feared that a Conservative conspiracy was in the making, but Toni also criticized the PNL papers for suggesting the same.|$|E
25|$|He {{was first}} arrested in late 1883, after Okhrana units decapitated the Bessarabian {{wing of the}} Narodnaya Volya. Detained in Odessa (during which time he read intensely), <b>Stere</b> was {{frequently}} visited by Maria Grosu, the sister of Alexandru, who {{had fallen in love}} with him— a Narodnik and a feminist, she asked <b>Stere</b> for a marriage of convenience that was meant to help her become free from parental tutelage (according to the laws of the Russian Empire, unmarried women were under their father's protection). <b>Stere</b> agreed, and they were married in the prison chapel (1885).|$|E
5000|$|In 2013 {{with the}} Wilmington Hammerheads, {{he led the}} team in goals with seven, and had three assists. [...] He {{received}} the team's Most Valuable Player award and {{was named to the}} 2013 USL PRO All-League Second Team. In the 2014 season, <b>Steres</b> signed for LA Galaxy II and in the following season, he was named captain, and leading the Galaxy to their first USL Championship final. During the two seasons he was with LA Galaxy II, <b>Steres</b> was named Defender of the Year in both seasons.|$|R
25|$|He soon {{clashed with}} the more {{conservative}} politicians who had been members of the PNR. In March 1930, the mention of his name during a public celebration provoked a number of Romanian Army generals to leave in protest; immediately after, the National Liberal group around Vintilă Brătianu began attacking <b>Stere's</b> party for harbouring him, and for causing a split between Army and political establishment. General Henry Cihoschi, the Minister of Defense, was publicly criticized in parliament for not siding with his subordinates, and had to resign on April 4; Maniu appeared to support <b>Stere's</b> ousting.|$|R
25|$|<b>Stere's</b> {{position}} in his party's leadership prevented it from entering a close {{union with the}} Transylvania-based Romanian National Party (PNR) in 1924, as the PNR's leaders resented his anti-Entente past.|$|R
25|$|Constantin G. <b>Stere</b> or Constantin Sterea (Romanian; , Konstantin Yegorovich <b>Stere</b> or Константин Георгиевич Стере, Konstantin Georgiyevich Stere; {{also known}} under his pen name Șărcăleanu; June 1, 1865– June 26, 1936) was a Romanian writer, jurist, politician, ideologue of the Poporanist trend, and, in March 1906, co-founder (together with Garabet Ibrăileanu and Paul Bujor— {{the latter was}} {{afterwards}} replaced by the physician Ioan Cantacuzino) of the literary magazine Viața Românească. One of the central figures of the Bessarabian intelligentsia at the time, <b>Stere</b> was a key actor during the Union of Bessarabia with Romania in 1918, and is associated with its legacy.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in Horodiște, Soroca County, to a family of boyar origins from Ciripcău, Bessarabia— {{which was part of}} the Russian Empire at the time. <b>Stere</b> was one of the three sons of an ethnic Romanian couple of Russian citizens: Gheorghe or Iorgu <b>Stere</b> (known as Yegor Stepanovich <b>Stere,</b> Егор Степанович Стере in Russian), a {{landowner}} whose family was originally from Botoșani County in the Romanian part of Moldavia, and Pulcheria (Пулкерия), a member of the impoverished gentry in Bessarabia. He spent most of his early years, until the age of eight, in Ciripcău, where the family manor was located.|$|E

25|$|With {{the change}} in {{fortunes}} brought by the Armistice with Germany, <b>Stere</b> was charged with treason and imprisoned; never facing trial, he was eventually set free.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, <b>Stere</b> {{obtained}} a licensure with a thesis on legal entity and individualism, one which drew {{criticism from the}} influential Conservative-inspired group Junimea, {{on the assumption that}} it had been partly inspired by Marx. At the time, he also published an incomplete series of philosophical essays centered on the works of Wilhelm Wundt. After graduation, <b>Stere,</b> who was by then the father of four, lived for a while in Ploiești, and afterwards joined the Bar association in Iași as a practicing lawyer. During the period, he met and befriended the influential writer Ion Luca Caragiale.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stere</b> {{sided with}} Brătianu and Vasile Lascăr in 1904, {{at a time}} when the two confronted Sturdza and {{resigned}} from their government offices, provoking the cabinet's fall (and Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino's reinstatement as Premier).|$|E

25|$|Despite his dissidence, <b>Stere's</b> ideas {{remained}} highly influential {{inside the}} National Peasants' Party, and constituted {{a major influence}} on the doctrines of Virgil Madgearu. Poporanism, alongside Marxism itself, was a contributing factor in Dimitrie Gusti's original theories on sociology.|$|R
25|$|Instead, {{he became}} {{familiar}} with Neo-Kantian philosophy, expanding on {{his interest in}} Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (which he was reading in Beryozovsky District). It was {{at this time that}} <b>Stere</b> began writing.|$|E
25|$|Simona Halep {{was born}} in Constanța Romania, to <b>Stere</b> and Tania Halep, a family of Aromanian descent. Her father, a former {{football}} player at Săgeata Stejaru playing in the lower leagues, owns a dairy products factory.|$|E
25|$|In {{his later}} years, <b>Stere</b> {{argued that he}} had {{foreseen}} Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War and the string of social problems Russia experienced, {{and that he had}} sent the General Staff of the Romanian Army a memorandum on the matter.|$|E
50|$|After {{two seasons}} with LA Galaxy's reserve team, he {{was rewarded with}} a first-team {{contract}} on December 17, 2015. <b>Steres</b> scored in his debut against DC United on a corner kick from Mike Magee, he goal started a come-from-behind win.|$|R

25|$|In summer 1916, Romania {{disappointed}} Arbore by rallying {{with the}} Entente. After a short-lived offensive into Transylvania, the Romanian Land Forces were defeated, and the Central Powers invaded southern Romania. Arbore stayed behind in German-occupied Bucharest while the legitimate government withdrew to Iași, and maintained a generally friendly but discreet {{attitude toward the}} occupiers. He was less active as a journalist and militant, but contributed to the Germanophile daily Lumina, {{put out by the}} Bessarabian activist Constantin <b>Stere,</b> and once lectured on the Bessarabian question during April 1918. Arbore also kept a low profile during the 1918 truce, when, with German acquiescence, Romania united with Bessarabia. Reputedly, <b>Stere,</b> who negotiated the union with the Bessarabian Assembly, mistrusted and sidelined Arbore during the events.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, <b>Stere</b> {{strongly}} supported Romania's {{alliance with the}} Central Powers, arguing {{in favor of a}} policy focused on Bessarabia's recovery and against what he saw as Russian expansionism - ultimately, this led him to split with the pro-Entente PNL upon the outbreak of World War I. The socialist Ioan Nădejde commented on the fact that <b>Stere</b> had become rivals with members of the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party who had joined the PNL in 1899, and especially with their leader Vasile Morțun. He joined his voice to a diverse intellectual opposition which also included the Conservative Party's Petre P. Carp and Alexandru Marghiloman, the left-leaning writers Tudor Arghezi, Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu, and Gala Galaction, as well as the revolutionary socialist Christian Rakovsky.|$|E
25|$|In reply, <b>Stere</b> again {{expressed}} his view that Romania's government {{had been wrong}} in 1916, and left to create the minor Democratic Peasants' Party–Stere (not {{to be confused with}} the one created later by Nicolae L. Lupu), which he led into a union with Grigore Iunian's Radical Peasants' Party.|$|E

25|$|<b>Stere's</b> {{break with}} Marxism {{led him to}} attempt persuading the newly created Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR) to amend its proletariat-focused policies, and, in 1893, to found the student society Datoria ("The Duty"), which {{preserved}} the Narodnik focus on educating peasants. He and his followers nevertheless continued to rely much of their thesis on Marxist concepts, coupled with an interest taken in the reformist socialist way advocated by Eduard Bernstein.|$|R
