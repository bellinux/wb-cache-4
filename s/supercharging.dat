5|$|Tesla Motors {{designed}} its Model S {{to allow}} fast battery swapping. In June 2013, Tesla announced their goal to deploy a battery swapping station {{in each of}} its <b>supercharging</b> stations. At a demonstration event Tesla showed that a battery swap operation with the Model S takes just over 90 seconds, {{about half the time}} it takes to refill a gasoline-powered car used for comparison purposes during the event. The first stations are planned to be deployed along Interstate 5 in California where, according to Tesla, a large number of Model S sedans make the San Francisco-Los Angeles trip regularly. These will be followed by the Washington, DC to Boston corridor.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} TVS <b>supercharger</b> {{was invented}} by Eaton Corporation, a company which has been inventing superchargers since 1985. The TVS <b>supercharger</b> is a 5th generation <b>supercharger</b> and its design was stated to be a game changer for the world of superchargers. The TVS <b>supercharger</b> at its initial release was being primarily used by muscle car fanatics in their much older, 1960's-1970's, muscle cars. This is because superchargers tended to be heavier and better suited to increase power on heavier muscle cars who could handle the extra weight, rather than the modern-lighter sports cars being invented today. However, due to the lighter and more efficient design of the TVS <b>supercharger,</b> the TVS <b>supercharger</b> was quickly picked up by many modern car companies [...] One of the first companies to employ this <b>supercharger</b> was Toyota in their Toyota Aurion in 2007 and Audi quickly followed in 2010 by employing the TVS <b>supercharger</b> in all of their TFSI V6 engines. Currently {{there are many other}} high-end luxury and sport car companies using the TVS <b>supercharger</b> in their production line including: Chevrolet (Corvette ZR1), Cadillac (CTS-V), Jaguar (XFR), Lotus (Evora S) , Range Rover (5.0 L V8), and Mustang (GT 500).|$|R
25|$|The Mark II Polo {{was used}} {{extensively}} by Volkswagen to develop future innovations, for example <b>supercharging</b> with a 40mm G-Lader supercharger in the GT G40 version. A 60mm G-Lader {{would later be}} used on the larger and more technically challenging G60 engine used in the Golf and Corrado.|$|E
25|$|The Kestrel was {{produced}} in 40 distinct variants which {{can be divided into}} three main groups: normally aspirated, medium supercharged, and fully supercharged. One variant, the Kestrel VIII, was configured as a 'pusher engine' for the Short Singapore flying boat. Apart from <b>supercharging,</b> the variant differences centred on varying compression ratios and propeller reduction gearing.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of an}} {{investigation}} to increase the power output of the V- 1710 - 93 engine at altitude, the engine-stage <b>supercharger</b> was combined with a constant-area vaneless diffuser designed to improve {{the performance of the}} engine-stage <b>supercharger</b> at the rated engine operating point. The performance of the modified <b>supercharger</b> was investigated in a variable-component <b>supercharger</b> test rig and compared with that of the standard <b>supercharger</b> with an 8 -vaned diffuser. A separate evaluation of the component efficiencies and a study of the flow characteristics of the modified <b>supercharger</b> was made possible by internal diffuser instrumentation. At the volume flow required by the engine for rated operating conditions, the modified <b>supercharger</b> increased the over-all adiabatic efficiency 0. 05 and the over-all pressure coefficient 0. 035. Furthermore, the capacity of the engine-stage <b>supercharger</b> was increased by replacing the standard 8 -vaned diffuser with the vaneless diffuser. The peak over-all adiabatic efficiency for the modified <b>supercharger,</b> however, was 0. 05 to 0. 07 lower than that of the standard unit over the range of tip speeds investigated. The improved performance of the modified <b>supercharger</b> at rated engine operating conditions resulted from a shift of the point of peak adiabatic efficiency and pressure coefficient of the standard <b>supercharger</b> to a higher flow. The energy loss through the vaneless diffuser was found to be small. Because of the restricted diffuser diameter, however, diffusion was inadequate, which resulted in a relatively small static-pressure rise through the diffuser, high diffuser-exit velocities, and excessive collector-case losses...|$|R
25|$|Arthur Rowledge, one of Napier's chief {{engineers}} and the {{designer of the}} Napier Lion engine, became fed up with management and left for Rolls. In this one move any Napier design effort ended while Rolls' received a boost. Applying every known advance since the D-12 was introduced, Rowledge designed the new engine to use <b>supercharging</b> at all altitudes, allowing it to outperform naturally aspirated engines {{by as much as}} they were willing to increase the boost pressure.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1920s, Alfa's RL was {{considered}} too large and heavy, so {{a new development}} began. The 2-liter formula that had led to Alfa Romeo winning the Automobile World Championship in 1925, changed to 1.5 liter for the 1926 season. The 6C 1500 was introduced in 1925 at the Milan Motor Show, production started 1927, with the P2 Grand Prix car as starting point. Engine capacity was now 1487cc, against the P2's 1987cc, while <b>supercharging</b> was dropped. First versions were bodied by Young and Touring.|$|E
25|$|Enveloping {{this rather}} {{conservative}} chassis was a low, curvaceous alloy-panel body, built in-house by Maserati. Maserati also built a streamlined {{version of the}} 4CL from the outset. Continued engine development, in response to Alfa Romeo's post-war introduction of two-stage <b>supercharging,</b> began to expose weaknesses in the chassis design. In an attempt to improve torsional rigidity Maserati began to experiment with tubular section chassis members. These experimental models ran alongside conventional 4CLs throughout the 1947 season, and {{eventually led to the}} introduction of the 4CLT in 1948.|$|E

25|$|The Type 118 was a Bristol private venture, {{designed}} to provide a multi-role machine capable of acting as a fighter, bomber, reconnaissance or casualty-extraction aircraft for foreign air forces unable to afford a range of more specialised aircraft. The variety of roles required a two-seater and the need for high-altitude performance for the photo-reconnaissance role, for example, called for <b>supercharging.</b> Since the Bristol Jupiter radial engine design was ageing, the newer Bristol Mercury seemed a natural choice of powerplant. The first prototype was to have a supercharged Bristol Jupiter XFA engine, with the Mercury V installed in the second machine which was labelled the Type 118A.|$|E
25|$|Power {{comes from}} {{overhead}} valve (two per cylinder), pushrod, naturally aspirated, carbureted 358 cubic inch (5.86 L) V8 engines, producing anywhere from 850 to 875 horsepower. The minimum base weight (including driver and driver gear) for all cars is 2,780 pounds. Fuel cell capacity is 33 U.S. gallons. Current rules {{allow for the}} use of leaded gasoline, whereas all other classes must use unleaded gas. The use of Nitrous Oxide (or other similar compounds or systems), fuel additives, and/or fuel cooling, as well as <b>supercharging</b> or turbocharging is strictly prohibited in all classes. Automatic transmissions are prohibited, and manual transmissions must have no more than 5 forward speeds, and a functional reverse speed.|$|E
25|$|Over time, Wright refined the R-760, using suffix {{letters to}} {{indicate}} successive versions. The original R-760 (or J-6-7) was rated for 225hp (168kW), while the R-760E of 1931 could do 250hp (186kW) {{thanks to an}} improved cylinder head design. Wright later added another suffix to show different power levels. The R-760E-1, introduced {{the same year as}} the R-760E, had a takeoff power rating of 300hp (224kW) thanks to higher-compression pistons and a greater RPM limit. The even more powerful R-760E-2 of 1935 could reach 350hp (261kW) for takeoff due to increased <b>supercharging</b> and an even higher RPM limit. On the other hand, the R-760E-T, designed for trainer aircraft, had the R-760E-1's high-compression pistons, but the supercharger was removed, thus giving just 235hp (175kW).|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} <b>supercharges</b> in a spinor {{depends on the}} {{dimension}} and the signature of spacetime. The <b>supercharges</b> occur in spinors. Thus the limit {{on the number of}} <b>supercharges</b> cannot be satisfied in a spacetime of arbitrary dimension. Some theoretical examples in which this is satisfied are: ...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{example is}} a <b>supercharger,</b> which derives its power from the engine and creates more power for the engine. The power that the <b>supercharger</b> consumes is {{parasitic}} loss and is usually expressed in horsepower (HP). While the HP that the <b>supercharger</b> consumes in comparison to what it generates is small, it is still measurable or calculable. One of the desirable features of a turbocharger over a <b>supercharger</b> is the lower parasitic loss of the former.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the TVS <b>supercharger</b> is {{also able}} to beat most other superchargers with its design {{improvements}} which pack more air through the fourth lobe, and its lower temperature functionality. Low temperature functionality is possible because the TVS <b>supercharger</b> {{does not have to}} spin as much to pack air into the combustion chamber. As a result, the TVS <b>supercharger</b> produces a significantly lower amount of heat through the entire process. Thus there is more energy delivered straight to the <b>supercharger</b> for more air, less energy is wasted as heat (70% thermal efficiency) and the need for an external cooling unit to cool down the <b>supercharger</b> is eliminated. External cooling, as many other <b>supercharger</b> units would require, would mean a decrease in pressure and an increase in the weight of the car causing it to be slower, the antithesis of what superchargers are meant to do. However, the TVS <b>supercharger</b> is not only efficient in cycling power but also in maintaining fuel efficiency as well.|$|R
25|$|On 1 January 2016, a 2014 Model S {{caught fire}} in Norway while <b>supercharging</b> unsupervised. The vehicle was totally {{destroyed}} but nobody was injured. The fire was slow, {{and the owner}} had time to unplug the car and retrieve possessions. An investigation by the Norwegian Accident Investigation Board (AIBN) indicated that the fire originated in the car, but was otherwise inconclusive. In March 2016, Tesla stated that their own investigation into the incident concluded that the fire {{was caused by a}} short circuit in the vehicle's distribution box, but that the amount of damage prevented them from determining the exact cause. Tesla stated that the Supercharger detected the short circuit and deactivated, and a future Model S software update would stop the vehicle from charging if a short circuit is detected.|$|E
25|$|<b>Supercharging</b> {{was used}} to force the charge into the cylinder, rather than {{crankcase}} compression, as on most two-stroke engines. This allowed {{the use of a}} conventional lubrication system, instead of the total-loss type found in many two-stroke engines. Stratified charge was used: the fuel was injected into a bulb-like extension of the combustion chamber where the twin spark plugs ignited the rich mixture. Operable air-fuel ratios of from 15 to 23:1 were available to govern the power produced between maximum and 60%. The rich mixture maintained near the spark plugs reduced detonation, allowing higher compression ratios or supercharger boost. Supercharger throttling was used as well to achieve idling. The supercharger throttles were novel vortex types, varying the effective angle of attack of the impeller blades from 60 to 30 degrees. This reduced the power required to drive the supercharger when throttled, and hence fuel consumption at cruising power.|$|E
25|$|In , in {{an attempt}} to curb speeds, Formula One was {{downgraded}} to 1.5-litre, non-supercharged engines (essentially the then-current Formula Two rules), a formula which would remain for the next five years. Forced induction was still an option, but limited to 750cc and no one seriously considered the option, as <b>supercharging</b> had proven limiting to fuel consumption. Ferrari could have used its already proven V6 powered mid-engined Formula 2 cars, but preferred to go one step forward by designing a very sophisticated car powered by a 120° V6, which was their first ever rear-mid engined car, the 156. The considerably more powerful and efficient engine Ferrari had led to the Maranello outfit dominating the 1961 season as the British teams scrambled {{to come up with a}} suitable engine. American Phil Hill won the 1961 title in a works Ferrari. His teammate, Wolfgang von Trips of Germany, died along with 14 spectators in a horrific crash on the first lap of the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.|$|E
5000|$|A {{mechanically}} driven <b>supercharger</b> has to {{take its}} drive power from the engine.

The engine has to burn extra fuel to provide power to drive the <b>supercharger.</b> The increased air density during the input cycle increases the specific power of the engine and its power-to-weight ratio, but at the cost of an increase in the specific fuel consumption of the engine. In addition to increasing the cost of running the aircraft a <b>supercharger</b> has the potential to reduce its overall range for a specific fuel load.|$|R

50|$|<b>Supercharge,</b> {{denoted by}} the symbol Q, is an {{operator}} which transforms bosons into fermions, and vice versa. Since the <b>supercharge</b> operator changes a particle with spin one-half to a particle with spin one or zero, the <b>supercharge</b> {{itself is a}} spinor that carries one half unit of spin.|$|R
