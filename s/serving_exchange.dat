5000|$|For each <b>serving</b> <b>exchange</b> {{involved}} in providing end user access lines, a virtual path is provisioned to a BT ATM switch on BT's core network. A virtual path can {{range in size}} from 250 kbit/s to 34 Mbit/s. One or more Digital Subscriber Line Digital Multiplexers at the <b>serving</b> <b>exchange</b> combine the traffic from the end user access lines for delivery to the ATM switch.|$|E
50|$|Where VDSL or VDSL2 is used {{to deliver}} a service, {{competing}} SLU operators at the same site must adhere to tie cable length limitations to prevent interference. Other restrictions are in force to prevent interference with ADSL or ADSL2+ frequencies on the local loop from the <b>serving</b> <b>exchange.</b> In the UK the incumbent telco aggregation cabinets are known as Primary Connection Points (PCPs) and each one is assigned a CAL (Cabinet Assigned Loss) value based on its distance from the <b>serving</b> <b>exchange.</b>|$|E
5000|$|BT {{provided}} connectivity {{between the}} end user and the nearest BT <b>Serving</b> <b>Exchange</b> via asymmetric digital subscriber line, symmetric digital subscriber line, and fibre to the x. The end user access line could have a bandwidth ranging between 288 kbit/s and 8,128 kbit/s (8 Mibit/s) downstream and up to 832 kbit/s upstream for Asymmetric digital subscriber line, and up to 2048 kbit/s (2 Mibit/s) for Symmetric digital subscriber line. For fibre-based connections, speeds can {{be as high as}} 100 Mbit/s although most connections of this type are fibre from exchange to cabinet so therefore limited to a maximum of 40 Mbit/s.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{four of the}} {{platforms}} at Exchange were closed and demolished to enable tunnelling work to begin for the Merseyrail underground. Part of this ambitious scheme involved diverting the Ormskirk and Southport electric services under Exchange station and into a new tunnel running north to south under Liverpool's city centre, named the Link Tunnel, linking separate lines {{in the north and}} south of the city creating a north-south crossrail. Exchange station would be replaced by a station in the new tunnel named Moorfields. Trains formerly <b>serving</b> <b>Exchange</b> station call at the new nearby Moorfields underground station then continue in the tunnel to terminate at Liverpool Central underground station, or onwards to Hunts Cross in the extreme south of the city. At both Moorfields and Central stations easy interchange was possible {{for the first time with}} Wirral Line services, which until then had operated as a completely separate network.|$|E

25|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was <b>served,</b> <b>exchange</b> plates. After we had done so, {{he shook his head}} in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|R

5000|$|... 5XB was {{originally}} intended to bring the benefits of crossbar switching to towns and small cities {{with only a few}} thousand telephone lines. The typical starting size was 3000 to 5000 lines, but the system had essentially unlimited growth capacity. The earlier 1XB urban crossbar was impractically expensive in small installations, and had difficulties handling large trunk groups. 5XB was converted to wire spring relays in the 1950s and otherwise upgraded in the 1960s to <b>serve</b> <b>exchanges</b> {{with tens of thousands of}} lines. The final 5A Crossbar variant, produced starting in 1972, was available only in sizes of 980 and 1960 lines, and generally delivered on one pallet, rather than assembled on site as usual for larger exchanges.|$|R
