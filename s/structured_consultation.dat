40|$|Background: Implementation of {{evidence-based}} {{practices with}} fidelity during early intervention {{is important in}} achieving positive outcomes for children with autism spectrum disorder. However, uptake with fidelity has been poor in community settings. Traditional professional development approaches {{have done little to}} change practice. This has stimulated interest in researching the use of <b>structured</b> <b>consultation</b> to address this challenge. Method: In this study, we used a single case experimental design with multiple baselines across participants to investigate the effects of <b>structured</b> <b>consultation</b> on the use of descriptive praise. Participants were 4 early intervention professional and paraprofessional staff, 1 in the role of consultant and 3 consultees. Results: All consultees learned to implement descriptive praise with fidelity and maintained improvements at follow-up. All participants rated the professional development program based on <b>structured</b> <b>consultation</b> as socially valid. Conclusions: <b>Structured</b> <b>consultation</b> improved treatment fidelity and was acceptable to staff. Replication on a larger scale is recommended.

40|$|Current {{guidelines}} recommend chronic obstructive {{pulmonary disease}} (COPD) management based on symptoms or health status assessment and lung function parameters. However, COPD {{is a complex}} and heterogeneous disease that needs an individualized approach for proper disease management. A <b>structured</b> <b>consultation</b> including health status assessment tools, such as the Clinical COPD Questionnaire and the COPD Assessment Test should improve the quality of the consultation, providing more information than symptoms alone. Both questionnaires are designed to provide the clinician information enabling a more personalized disease approach and subsequent management.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To study doctor-patient {{interaction}} {{styles in}} consultations with patients presenting persistent medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) and to study on which {{stages of the}} consultation patients and doctors focus within the available time. METHODS: exploratory, qualitative analysis of transcripts of 20 videotaped consultations between family physicians (FP) and persistent MUS patients. RESULTS: Patients presented many symptoms in a rather unstructured way. However, FPs hardly used structuring techniques such as agenda setting and summarizing. Patients with persistent MUS got much opportunity to tell their story, but the reasons for encounter, their beliefs and concerns were not discussed in a <b>structured</b> manner. Although <b>consultations</b> were focused on these issues, mostly patients themselves initiated discussion of their ideas, concerns and expectations. FPs' extensive explanations {{of the origin of}} the symptoms often did not take patients' beliefs and concerns into account. CONCLUSIONS: Due to patients' multiple symptom presentation and the absence of FPs' <b>structuring</b> techniques, <b>consultations</b> of persistent MUS patients proceed rather unfocused. However, patients got ample opportunity to tell their story. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Persistent MUS patients might benefit from <b>structured</b> <b>consultations</b> focused on the exploration of the reason for encounter...|$|R

40|$|Background and aim: Clients' {{acceptance}} and adherence with orthoses can {{be influenced by}} a clinician's communication skills. In this clinical note, we describe two communication techniques, {{in the context of}} therapeutic footwear. Technique: Person-centred communication involves engaging with and listening to the attitudes of the client towards their condition, as well as discussing {{acceptance and}} expectations, in a <b>structured</b> <b>consultation.</b> Building a relationship is crucial and requires clients to feel heard and understood. An important influence on the acceptance and adherence is that a client makes a conscious decision to receive their device. This active receipt can be facilitated through shared decision making, wherein clinicians give clear, relevant and meaningful examples, based on clinical evidence, and ensure this is understood. Discussion: Two communication techniques for clinicians providing therapeutic footwear are described. These can be adapted for use with provision of other assistive technologies to improve client acceptance and adherence...|$|E
40|$|Quality {{has become}} the key concept in {{official}} statistics. There is a general consensus {{that we have to}} consider several components when assessing the quality of statistical information. Relevance, accuracy, timeliness, punctuality, comparability, coherence, accessibility and clarity are the dimensions most frequently mentioned. In this article we use regression analysis to evaluate the contribution of these different dimensions when assessing the overall quality of statistical products. We do this using the information collected in the <b>structured</b> <b>consultation</b> with users and experts from {{both inside and outside the}} Spanish Central Administration carried out by the Working Group of the Spanish High Council on Statistics, responsible for the preliminary draft of the proposals and recommendations of this council for the Spanish Multiannual Statistical Programme 2013 - 2016.

Aims: This project aims {{to make the case for}} the development of an online support intervention, designed to effectively support midwives in distress. Methods: Literature reviews were conducted, and midwives and other subject experts were recruited to participate in a Delphi study via a research blog. Findings: Following literature reviews and a <b>structured</b> <b>consultation</b> with 66 participants, it was found that the development of an online intervention designed to support midwives with work-related psychological distress should prioritise confidentiality and anonymity, along with 24 -hour mobile access and a range of other components.

We report our work towards evidence-based and patient-centred care for adults with these injuries. Methods: We developed a systematic programme of research that built on our systematic review of the evidence of effectiveness of treatment interventions for these fractures. We devised schemata showing 'typical' care pathways and identified over 100 patient management questions. These depicted the more important decisions taken when progressing along each care pathway. We compiled a comprehensive document summarising the evidence available for each decision point from our reviews of randomised trials of treatment interventions. Using these documents, we undertook a formal and <b>structured</b> <b>consultation</b> process involving key players, including a patient representative, to obtain {{their views on the}} available evidence and to establish a research agenda. The resulting feedback was then processed and interpreted, using systematic methods. Results: Some evidence from 114 randomised trials was available for 31 of the 117 patient management questions.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{quality of}} doctor-patient {{communication}} {{has a major}} impact on the quality of medical care. Communication guidelines define best practices for doctor patient communication and are therefore an important tool for improving communication. However, adherence to communication guidelines remains low, despite doctors participating in intensive communication skill training. Implementation research shows that adherence is higher for guidelines in general that are user centred and feasible, which implies that they are consistent with users' opinions, tap into users' existing skills and fit into existing routines. Developers of communication guidelines seem to have been somewhat negligent with regard to user preferences and guideline feasibility. In order to promote the development of user centred and practicable communication guidelines, we elicited user preferences and identified which guideline characteristics facilitate or impede guideline use. Methods Seven focus group interviews were conducted with experienced GPs, communication trainers (GPs and behavioural scientists) and communication learners (GP trainees and medical students) and three focus group interviews with groups of GP trainees only. All interviews were transcribed and analysed qualitatively. Results The participants identified more impeding guideline characteristics than facilitating ones. The most important impeding characteristic was that guidelines do not easily fit into GPs' day-to-day practice. This is due to rigidity and inefficiency of communication guidelines and erroneous assumptions underpinning guideline development. The most important facilitating characteristic was guideline structure. Guidelines that were structured in distinct phases helped users to remain in control of consultations, which was especially useful in complicated consultations. Conclusion Although communication guidelines are generally considered useful, especially for <b>structuring</b> <b>consultations,</b> their usefulness is impaired by lack of flexibility and applicability to practice routines. User centred and feasible guidelines should combine the advantages of helping doctors to <b>structure</b> <b>consultations</b> with flexibility to tailor communication strategies to specific contexts and situations. </p...|$|R

40|$|Though UN {{peacekeeping}} {{has changed}} dramatically since its inception, peacekeepers are still ostensibly committed to the "holy trinity" of consent, impartiality, and minimum use of force. Impartiality has come under special pressure, as peacekeepers are increasingly expected not only to observe the situation, but to take forceful action against "spoiler" groups that threaten the peace or human rights. This essay draws on official statements, outside analysis, {{and a number of}} interviews with peacekeepers conducted by the author and his research assistant, to demonstrate that a wide variety of understandings of "impartiality" currently exist, potentially undermining peacekeeping operations. The author attempts to systematize these variations according to how they understand the standard of impartiality, the process for making impartial decisions, and the scope of operations that fall under the concept. Ultimately, the author argues for an understanding of impartiality that is practically focused on achieving peace and includes <b>structured</b> <b>consultations</b> with all parties as a conceptual necessity, not just a helpful technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{widening}} participation agenda and related concerns about student retention require a more systematic focus on supporting student success. This paper describes a process designed with the dual goals {{of supporting the}} short-term academic recovery of students at risk of non-continuation due to early difficulties with assessment and developing their ongoing capabilities for self-regulation around challenging assessment tasks. Commencing students who failed or marginally passed their first piece of university assessment {{were invited to participate}} in a two-stage process: independently completing a reflective workbook designed to help them understand the reasons for their assessment performance, followed by a <b>structured</b> <b>consultation</b> with their tutor to identify improvement goals and strategies. Students undertaking the academic recovery process achieved higher pass rates for the second assessment item and for the course overall than a comparative group of students who did not participate. Findings indicate that a self-regulation-based intervention can contribute to students' academic persistence and success. Importantly, students experienced the intervention as providing insight into their underperformance on assessment and developing their capacity for metalearning.

40|$|Purpose Team {{formulation}} {{is promoted}} by professional practice guidelines for clinical psychologists. However, {{it is unclear}} whether team formulation is understood/implemented in consistent ways – or whether there is outcome evidence to support the promotion of this practice. This systematic review aimed to (1) synthesize how team formulation practice is defined and implemented by practitioner psychologists and (2) analyse the range of team formulation outcomes in the peer-reviewed literature. Methods Seven electronic bibliographic databases were searched in June 2016. Eleven articles met inclusion criteria and were quality assessed. Extracted data were synthesized using content analysis. Results Descriptions of team formulation revealed three main forms of instantiation: (1) a <b>structured,</b> <b>consultation</b> approach; (2) semi-structured, reflective practice meetings; and (3) unstructured/informal sharing of ideas through routine interactions. Outcome evidence linked team formulation to a range of outcomes for staff teams and service users, including some negative outcomes. Quality appraisal identified significant issues with evaluation methods; such that, overall, outcomes were not well-supported. Conclusions There is weak evidence to support the claimed beneficial outcomes of team formulation in practice. There is a need for greater specification and standardization of ‘team formulation’ practices, to enable a clearer understanding of any relationships with outcomes and implications for best-practice implementations...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} the Carneades opinion formation and polling tool, which {{was inspired by}} work by Katie Atkinson, Trevor Bench-Capon and Adam Wyner at the University of Liverpool on the <b>Structured</b> <b>Consultation</b> Tool (SCT) they developed in the European IMPACT project. The Carneades polling tool generalises and extends their results by using argument graphs to support consultations about any argument, independent of the argumentation schemes used to reconstruct the arguments, by collecting feedback on the arguments put forward {{on all sides of}} a debate, rather than only the arguments of a single position of one party, such as the government agency proposing some policy, and by providing a convenient way for respondents to rank stakeholders by {{the extent to which they}} share opinions. Argument graphs abstract away details of the argumentation schemes used to construct or reconstruct the arguments but not needed for the purposes of conducting the poll. Moreover, Carneades provides a high-level declarative language for argumentation schemes, enabling humanities scholars, such as lawyers or argumentation experts, to define and configure the set of argumentation schemes to be used to construct the argumentation graphs, without requiring technical computer science skills or modifications to the implementation of the polling tool...|$|E
40|$|On 1 July 2012, Australia {{commenced}} {{operation of}} its clean energy legislation (CEL) {{with the introduction}} of a carbon price of A$ 23 per tonne. Prior to the commencement of CEL, the government engaged with business stakeholders in a round of <b>structured</b> <b>consultations.</b> This engagement process elicited various responses to the proposed laws from stakeholder firms and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Accordingly, in this paper we have used environmental management theories to examine the responses of firms and NGOs and identify critical 'pressure points' associated with the new laws. The results from our analysis showed that, during the consultations, stakeholders predominantly used pre-emptive responses and communications to shape and change the CEL. In addition, the critical legislative pressure point for business stakeholders was the capacity to manage carbon pricing liabilities in order to maintain sound ongoing financial and investment performance. The study also showed that the use of highly defensive and aggressive responses were ineffectual and did not materially impact the introduction of the new laws.

40|$|Background and objectives: Anxiety and Depressive {{disorders}} {{represent an}} important public health problem, which involves {{not only the}} mental health services, but the General Practice as well. This paper examines models of Collaboration between General Practice and Community Mental Health Services developed in Italy. Methods: Different Consultation -Liaison activities are presented. For every Collaboration model advantages and disadvantage are discussed. Results: The <b>structured</b> <b>Consultation</b> Liaison Service is based on supplying diagnostic consultation and therapeutic interventions in support of General Practitioners (GPs). The service could be based in either a Community Mental Health Centre (CMHC) or externally. Diagnostic evaluation can be followed by brief and focal therapeutic interventions, {{in support of the}} GP's therapeutic plan. The spontaneous collaboration in small centres are frequent in rural areas where the contained dimensions of the services and the direct acquaintance between psychiatrists and GPs encourage the personalization of the collaboration. The model of Liaison and Group-Training focuses on direct contact between consultant and GPs. In the course of regular meetings, the consultant gives the GPs supervision and education, and they can discuss the therapeutic plans for patients requiring specialist intervention. Conclusion: The empiric classification presented should be considered an attempt to represent a complex reality. Every service, in fact, carries out activities that are necessarily wider than abstract typologies and that overlap with other models' activities...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether locally developed guidelines on asthma and diabetes disseminated through practice based education improve {{quality of care}} in non-training, inner city general practices. DESIGN [...] Randomised controlled trial with each practice receiving one set of guidelines but providing data on the management of both conditions. SUBJECTS [...] 24 inner city, non-training general practices. SETTING [...] East London. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Recording of key variables in patient records (asthma: peak flow rate, review of inhaler technique, review of asthma symptoms, prophylaxis, occupation, and smoking habit; diabetes: blood glucose concentration, glycaemic control, funduscopy, feet examination, weight, and smoking habit); size of practice disease registers; prescribing in asthma; and use of <b>structured</b> <b>consultation</b> "prompts. " RESULTS [...] In practices receiving diabetes guidelines, significant improvements in recording were seen for all seven diabetes variables. Both groups of practices showed improved recording of review of inhaler technique, smoking habit, and review of asthma symptoms. In practices receiving asthma guidelines, further improvement was seen only in recording of review of inhaler technique and quality of prescribing in asthma. Sizes of disease registers were unchanged. The use of structured prompts was associated with improved recording of four of seven variables on diabetes and all six variables on asthma.

40|$|Background: Agencies {{promoting}} national health-care accreditation {{reform to}} improve the quality of care and safety of patients are largely working without specific blueprints that can increase the likelihood of success. Objective: This study investigated the development and implementation of the Australian Health Service Safety and Quality Accreditation Scheme and National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards (the Scheme), their expected benefits, and challenges and facilitators to implementation. Methods: A multimethod study was conducted using document analysis, observation and interviews. Data sources were eight government reports, 25 h of observation and 34 interviews with 197 diverse stakeholders. Results: Development of the Scheme was achieved through extensive consultation conducted over a prolonged period, that is, from 2000 onwards. Participants, prior to implementation, believed the Scheme would produce benefits at multiple levels of the health system. The Scheme offered a national framework to promote patient-centred care, allowing organizations to engage and coordinate professionals' quality improvement activities. Significant challenges are apparent, including developing and maintaining stakeholder understanding of the Scheme's requirements. Risks must also be addressed. The standardized application of, and reliable assessment against, the standards must be achieved to maintain credibility with the Scheme. Government employment of effective stakeholder engagement strategies, such as <b>structured</b> <b>consultation</b> processes, was viewed as necessary for successful, sustainable implementation. Conclusion: The Australian experience demonstrates that national accreditation reform can engender widespread stakeholder support, but implementation challenges must be overcome. In particular, the fundamental role of continued stakeholder engagement increases the likelihood that such reforms are taken up and spread across health systems. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|In 2004 a new {{contract}} was introduced for General Practitioners in the UK, which introduced a significant element of 'pay-for-performance', including both clinical and organisational targets. The introduction of this contract has caused interest across the world, particularly amongst those responsible for commissioning primary care services. It {{can be argued that}} the clinical targets in the contract (known as the Quality and Outcomes Framework, QOF) represent a move towards a more biomedical model of health and illness, which is contrary to the ideal of providing holistic (or biopsychosocial) care that has been traditionally espoused by GPs. This paper reports results from two linked studies (in England and Scotland) investigating {{the early stages of the}} {{new contract}}. We describe the way in which four practices with different organisational approaches and espoused identities have all changed their practice <b>structures,</b> <b>consultations</b> and clinical care in response to QOF in ways which will result in patients receiving a more biomedical type of care. In spite of these observed changes, respondents continued to maintain discursive claims to holism.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{many parts}} of the world, {{patients}} may find it difficult to visit doctors who share the same language and culture due to the intermingling of people and international recruitment of doctors among many other reasons. In these multilingual multicultural settings (MMSs), doctor-patient interactions face new communication challenges. This study aims to identify the <b>structure</b> of clinical <b>consultation</b> and its phases in an MMS where both doctors and patients are non-native speakers (NNSs) of English. METHOD: This study takes on a discourse analytic approach to examine the <b>structure</b> of clinical <b>consultation</b> as an activity type. 25 clinical consultation sessions between non-native speakers of English in a public healthcare centre in Malaysia were audio-recorded. FINDINGS & DISCUSSION: The results show that there are some deviations from the mainstream <b>structure</b> of clinical <b>consultations</b> although, in general, the pattern is compatible with previous studies. Deviations are particularly marked in the opening and closing phases of consultation. CONCLUSION: In almost all interactions, there is a straightforward manner of beginning medical consultations. The absence of greetings may have naturally reduced the length of talk. Hence, by directly entering medical talks, the doctors voice their concern on the curing aspects of the consultation rather than its caring facets. The preference of curing priority to caring is more goal-oriented and in alignment with the consultation as an activity type...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{describe}} state directed transformation through urban regeneration {{policy in the}} context of Moss Side, Manchester in the North West of England. The thesis explores connections between the state project of urban regeneration and the lives of residents’ who were targeted by strategies. The thesis therefore moves from economic and political contexts that informed the policies of urban regeneration to how they were implemented and by whom, and then into the personal lives of residents in order to demonstrate connections between these. The latter half of the thesis focuses particularly on residents who were associated with the gang “GCG” who were often the targets of regeneration strategies. The thesis deals with a variety of themes: global cities, governance, constructing race, recognition politics, localities, simulations and violence. These are grounded in detailed ethnography describing Moss Side through residents lives which transformed as a result of regeneration policy. The thesis argues that urban regeneration strategies do not (as is often argued by regeneration practitioners) relieve the difficulties existing residents experience and yet often have far reaching consequences. I demonstrate this through a variety of examples: new governing <b>structures,</b> <b>consultation</b> processes, anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs), gang members strategies opposing displacement, pirate radio disc jockeys searching for legitimacy, and the threat of sexual violence.

40|$|Background: Promotion {{of healthy}} pregnancies has gained high {{priority}} in the Netherlands because of relatively unfavorable perinatal outcomes. In response, a nationwide study, 'Healthy Pregnancy 4 All' (HP 4 ALL), has been initiated. Part of this study involves systematic and broadened antenatal risk assessment (the Risk Assessment substudy). Risk selection in current clinical practice is mainly based on medical risk factors. Despite the increasing evidence for the influence of nonmedical risk factors (social status, lifestyle or ethnicity) on perinatal outcomes, these risk factors remain highly unexposed. Systematic risk selection, combined with customized care pathways to reduce or treat detected risks, and regular and <b>structured</b> <b>consultation</b> between community midwives, gynecologists and other care providers such as social workers, {{is part of this}} study. Methods/Design: Neighborhoods in 14 municipalities with adverse perinatal outcomes above national and municipal averages are selected for participation. The study concerns a cluster randomized controlled trial. Municipalities are randomly allocated to intervention (n = 3, 500 pregnant women) and control groups (n = 3, 500 pregnant women). The intervention consists of systematic risk selection with the Rotterdam Reproductive Risk Reduction (R 4 U) score card in pregnant women at the booking visit, and referral to corresponding care pathways. A risk score, based on weighed risk factors derived from the R 4 U, above a predefined threshold determines structured multidisciplinary consultation. Primary outcomes of this trial are dysmaturity (birth weight < p 10), prematurity (birth < 37 weeks), and efficacy of implementation. Discussion: The 'HP 4 ALL' study introduces a systematic approach in antenatal health care that may improve perinatal outcomes and, thereby, affect future health status of a new generation in the Netherlands...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the key skills and knowledge required for the delivery of an ideal patient consultation {{in order to develop}} a training programme (using simulated-patients) to teach consultation skills to undergraduate pharmacy students. METHODS: Participants included all third year undergraduate Pharmacy students (MPharm, level III) at the School of Pharmacy & Biomolecular Sciences, University of Brighton (from October 1999 to March 2000). Working in groups of 12, students participated in two 4 hour seminars. A structured questionnaire was designed to assess students' perceptions of the difficulty of conducting a consultation and their confidence in delivering a <b>structured</b> <b>consultation.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Questionnaires were administered before and after delivery of the teaching programme to assess changes in students' confidence and ability to consult with patients. RESULTS: Twelve volunteers satisfied the criteria set to serve as simulated patients and then received appropriate training. Six scenarios were developed which focused on the key skills and knowledge identified from the adherence and consultation skills literature. A total of 91 students participated in the programme (mean age = 23 years, SD = 4. 5). Following participation in the programme students' perceived 'confidence' for conducting an effective consultation significantly increased (t = - 5. 9, p < 0. 01) while a statistically significant decrease was seen in students' perceived level of 'difficulty' when conducting a consultation (t = 4. 0, p < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: This study has shown that the use of a structured teaching programme improves students' perceptions of their ability and confidence in conducting an effective consultation. Providing skills training around the consultation process, using simulated patients, provides pharmacists with a good framework around which to practice pharmaceutical care...|$|E
40|$|Background: Heart failure (HF) is common, {{disabling}} and deadly. Patients with HF {{often have}} poor self-care and medicines non-adherence, which contributes to poor outcomes. Community pharmacy based cognitive services {{have the potential}} to help, but {{we do not know how}} patients view community-pharmacist-led services for patients with HF. Objective: We aimed to explore and portray in detail, the perspectives of patients receiving, and pharmacists delivering an enhanced, pay for performance community pharmacy HF service. Setting: Community pharmacies and community-based patients in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Scotland. Methods Focus groups with pharmacists and semi-structured interviews with individual patients by telephone. Cross sectional thematic analysis of qualitative data used Normalization Process Theory to understand and describe patient's reports. Main outcome measure: Experiences of receiving and delivering an enhanced HF service. Results: Pharmacists voiced their confidence in delivering the service and highlighted valued aspects including the <b>structured</b> <b>consultation</b> and repeated contacts with patients enabling the opportunity to improve self care and medicines adherence. Discussing co-morbidities other than HF was difficult and persuading patients to modify behaviour was challenging. Patients were comfortable discussing symptoms and medicines with pharmacists; they identified pharmacists as fulfilling roles that were needed but not currently addressed. Patients reported the service helped them to enact HF medicines and HF self care management strategies. Conclusion: Both patients receiving and pharmacists delivering a cognitive HF service felt that it addressed a shortfall in current care. There may be a clearly defined role for pharmacists in supporting patients to address the burden of understanding and managing their condition and treatment, leading to better self management and medicines adherence. This study may inform the development of strategies or policies to improve the process of care for patients with HF and has implications for the development of other extended role services...|$|E
