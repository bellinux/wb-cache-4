The results were compared of those students from 2003 2004 and 2005 completing the subject Principles of Finance and <b>who</b> <b>had,</b> or had not, completed the subject Business Statistics, a desired but not a formal prerequisite for Business Finance. First, the average mark in Principles of Finance for all <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> completed Business Statistics was compared to the average mark of all <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not completed Business Statistics. Second, the average pass mark for all students in Principles of Finance <b>who</b> <b>had</b> passed Business Statistics was compared to the average pass mark of all <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not passed Business Statistics. Third, the average pass mark for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been granted exemption from Business Statistics, based on prior learning, was compared to the average pass mark of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> passed Business Statistics. The results indicated that <b>students</b> <b>who</b> completed Business Statistics performed better overall than <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not completed Business Statistics and that <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> passed Business Statistics received significantly better grades in Principles of Finance than did <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not undertaken Business Statistics. <b>Students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been granted exemption performed as well as those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> passed Business Statistics. The findings imply that the use of discipline specific prerequisites reinforce the view that such a prerequisite provides the student with a minimum level of understanding required to undertake advanced subjects and in doing so improves the student’s chance of success...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine the effect of the learning models TSTS with Concept Mapping (TSTS CM) on mathematics learning achievement viewed from students Mathematical Reasoning Ability (MRA). This research was quasi experimental research with 3 x 3 factorial design. The population were the eighth-grade students of junior high schools in Kebumen Regency in the academic year of 2015 / 2016. Instruments used for data collection were mathematics achievement test and MRA test. The data analysis technique used was the two-way ANAVA with unbalanced cell.
