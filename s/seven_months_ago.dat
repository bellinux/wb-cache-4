500|$|The adult {{interest}} in the show is {{comparable to that of}} The Magic Roundabout, Tiny Toon Adventures, Rocko's Modern Life, Animaniacs, Dexters Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, SpongeBob SquarePants, Yo Gabba Gabba!, and Phineas and Ferb: older audiences appreciate jokes aimed at adult viewers and a sense of nostalgia for older cartoons and animated films. Many of the aforementioned shows had attracted college-aged fans who, when Friendship Is Magic was airing, would be raising children of their own. The show references works that older viewers would recognize, such as I Love Lucy, The Benny Hill Show, X-Men, , Diamond Dogs, The Big Lebowski, The Avengers, Star Wars, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Most of these fans are surprised by their fondness for the show. Shaun Scotellaro, operator of Equestria Daily, one of the main fan websites for the show, said, [...] "Honestly, if someone were to have told me I'd be writing a pony blog <b>seven</b> <b>months</b> <b>ago,</b> I would have called them insane." [...] He commented that the spread among adults was accelerated by its presence in online gaming. Mike Fahey, an editor for the gaming website Kotaku, noted that the fandom was [...] "building friendships among a diverse group of people that otherwise might have just sat {{on either side of the}} Internet, flinging insults at each other". Dr. Patrick Edwards, who performed several [...] "Brony Studies" [...] to survey and analyze the fandom, observed that the brony fandom is unlike most other fandoms which [...] "aren't welcoming to people who are different", and promote the show's message of love and tolerance. [...] Further interest came from the furry community, which includes a large number of animation fans. One contributor to [...] "The Brony Study" [...] (below), Dr. Marsha Redden said that the adult fans are [...] "a reaction to the US having been engrossed in terrorism for past ten years" [...] in a manner similar to the Cold War, and are [...] "tired of being afraid, tired of angst and animosity"; the show and its fandom are outlets from those strifes. She compared the brony fandom to that of the bohemian and beatniks after World War II and of the hippies after the Vietnam War. In a similar vein, Amy Keating Rogers, one of the show's writers, believes that the fans have come to like Friendship Is Magic due to [...] "so much cynicism and negativity out there in so many [...] shows", while the show [...] "has such a positive message" [...] that counters this.|$|E

Vizzy Zone, like Everybody's Nobody, received over 30,000 downloads. XV explained that he made Vizzy Zone for his fans to DJBooth. He said, [...] "This one I’m really doin’ for my fans.

And with me bein’ in the position I’m in right now, I need to hit them with something they can bump, since Everybody’s Nobody came out <b>seven,</b> eight <b>months</b> <b>ago.</b> So that’s my ultimate plan: give them some good music that follows up Everybody’s Nobody and that’s as good as Everybody’s Nobody, while I prepare The Kid with the Green Backpack which, right now, is amazing." [...] Vizzy Zone still received strong reviews, but many believe that it wasn't good enough to follow up Everybody's Nobody.|$|R

2500|$|In February 2004 Parliament elections, the Council of Guardians, {{a council}} of twelve members, {{half of whom}} are {{appointed}} by Ali Khamenei, disqualified thousands of candidates, including many of the reformist members of the parliament and all the candidates of the Islamic Iran Participation Front party from running.

2500|$|Eight {{months after}} the end of Season 2, Bree is about to leave for her honeymoon with Orson when she sees a news report on {{television}} about homeless teenagers, in which Andrew is interviewed. Horrified at what has happened to him, she cancels her honeymoon and sets out to retrieve Andrew, eventually finding him in a soup kitchen; she asks him to come back but he refuses. When she shouts [...] "I'm your mother, for God's sakes, you're my son!", Andrew replies [...] "No, you dumped your son at a gas station <b>seven</b> <b>months</b> <b>ago.</b> I'm somebody else now", and runs. When Orson sees how guilty Bree feels, he finds Andrew himself and buys him lunch. During their conversation, Andrew admits he worked the streets as a rent boy whenever he was desperate for money, and asks Orson not to tell his mother, before realizing what he's said and correcting himself. Orson does not try to force Andrew to come home but instead points out that the reason he is living on the streets is to punish his mother, and ultimately he will only destroy himself. Andrew does not initially appear to heed this, but returns home the next day at the end of [...] "A Weekend In the Country".|$|E

The histopathology was reported as mucinous adenocarcinoma of the retroperitoneum. Six cycles of intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy was administered during the last six months after diagnosis of recurrence by aspiration cytology and high serum tumor markers (CEA, CA 19 - 9). A few days ago, positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning showed evidence of local recurrence and single vertebral metastasis, so she was admitted again for systemic chemotherapy.

6000|$|In fact, Magháir Shu'ayb was {{spoken of}} as an Arab [...] "Happy Valley." [...] But its owners, the Masá'íd, a spiritless tribe {{numbering}} about seventy tents, are protégés of the Tagaygát. This Huwayti clan is on bad terms with Khizr and 'Brahim bin Makbúl; and the brother Shaykhs of the 'Imrán, recognized by the Egyptian Government, claim the land where they have only the right of transit. Bedawi clans and sub-tribes always combine against stranger families; but {{when there is no}} foreign [...] "war," [...] they amuse themselves with pilling and plundering, sabring and shooting one another. I believe that the palms were roasted to death by the 'Imrán, although the Shaykhs assured me that the damage was done this year, by a careless Mas'údi when cooking his food. The tribe appears to be Egypto-Arab, like the Huwayta't and the Ma'ázah, having congeners at Ghazzah (Gaze) and at Ras el-Wady, near Egyptian Tell el-Kebir. Consequently Rüppell is in error when he suspects that die Musaiti are ein Judenstamm.

Of all the thousand qualities a man may have, the only one you will find as certainly in the youngest drummer boy in my army as in me, is fear. It is fear that makes men fight: it is indifference that makes them run away: fear is the mainspring of war. Fear! I know fear well, better than you, better than any woman.
