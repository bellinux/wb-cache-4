5|$|The wing intercepted Soviet Tupolev Tu-95 Bear bombers on many occasions, {{the first}} of which {{occurred}} off Long Island on 25 April 1975. Many of these incidents involved escorting the Bears to Cuba. The wing occasionally shadowed drug smuggling aircraft, and on one occasion was <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> escort an unidentified object, which later {{turned out to be a}} weather balloon.|$|E
5|$|At the Lisbon Conference, {{the members}} of NATO agreed to appoint a Secretary General who would direct the organisation's staff and serve as Vice-Chairman of the Atlantic Council. The {{position}} was initially offered to Sir Oliver Franks, but he declined. As such, the allies <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> find someone else to take the position. Two weeks later, the countries agreed to ask Ismay to become Secretary General {{at the suggestion of}} Churchill and Anthony Eden.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, American {{officials}} <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> mobilize troops. Cass {{hurried to}} Prairie du Chien, where he organized the local militia. Colonel Snelling arrived at Prairie du Chien on July 10, bringing about 200 regulars from Fort Snelling to reoccupy Fort Crawford. He was joined there on July 29 by Brigadier General Henry Atkinson, who brought 500 men upriver by steamboat from Jefferson Barracks. Several days later, Henry Dodge arrived at Fort Crawford with 130 mounted militiamen, mostly miners. Governor Ninian Edwards of Illinois sent 600 mounted militiamen north to Wisconsin.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{there are}} 126 {{speaking}} {{parts in the}} film. Thousands of extras were hired during filming. Spielberg cast Israeli and Polish actors specially chosen for their Eastern European appearance. Many of the German actors were reluctant to don the SS uniform, {{but some of them}} later thanked Spielberg for the cathartic experience of performing in the movie. Halfway through the shoot, Spielberg conceived the epilogue, where 128 survivors pay their respects at Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. The producers <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> find the Schindlerjuden and fly them in to film the scene.|$|E
5|$|Reeling {{from the}} Hadong Ambush and being driven {{from the city}} of Chinju, the US Army's 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> protect the pass into Masan, the final South Korean city before the Naktong River, where the UN was holding its Pusan Perimeter in place. North Korean and US forces {{unexpectedly}} ran into one another and a confused battle ensued. American forces were better equipped with heavy weapons and armor thanks to newly arrived equipment in the country, and their better ground during the battle allowed them to repel North Korean advances.|$|E
5|$|The airline unsuccessfully <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} operations. A {{contract with}} Drammen-based Hercules and its Hamburg, West Germany-based subsidiary secured Trans Polar new operations, this time flying guest workers between West Germany and Turkey four times per week. Tjøntveit claimed on 2 June 1971 {{that he had}} secured new financing from British investors, who along with Norwegian shipping companies would purchase newly issued shares in the company. He also confirmed that the two Boeing 720s would return to Aer Lingus and plans for two new Boeing 707 aircraft to be purchased in time for planned operations to commence on 2 July.|$|E

5|$|The move of {{the company}} of the 45th Battalion down the exposed slope was disastrous, {{possibly}} as the company commander had not been advised of the particular difficulties involved. Moving in artillery formation, they were shelled and came under intense machine gun fire, suffering 11 killed and 37 wounded. The survivors <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> the embankment in small groups. Although the Official History is silent on who was responsible for this debacle, in his notebooks, the Official Historian, Charles Bean, blamed Imlay.|$|E
5|$|An enemy scout {{discovered}} Nulli Secunda quietly {{attempting to}} regain control with their Territorial Control Units (TCU). At around 14:00 UTC, with an hour remaining before Nulli Secunda could regain control, the CFC and Russian coalition sent a capital fleet to the station. RAZOR Alliance took the station, and the Russians destroyed the N3/PL Territorial Control Unit and set up its own TCU {{in order to establish}} control. Capturing the B-R5RB system would enable the CFC and Russian coalition to trap Pandemic Legion assets, including hundreds of capital and sub-capital ships, thus preventing those ships from joining the war. CFC and Russian coalition forces <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> gain control of the system, with thousands of players logging on and preparing their fleets.|$|E
5|$|Experienced and well-trained, 69 Squadron {{nevertheless}} {{entered the}} Yom Kippur War unready for the challenges {{brought about by}} start of the war. Prior to the outbreak of war, the IAF had been preparing for a pre-emptive strike against Egyptian and Syrian positions, but this {{was rejected by the}} Israeli government. 69 Squadron aircraft {{were in the process of}} re-armament to the air-to-air role when hostilities began at 14:00 on October 6, 1973. The aircraft were <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> perform CAPs, some having to dump their bomb loads in the Mediterranean, yet no aerial opposition was encountered. The squadron flew 37 sorties on the first day of the war, of which only 4 were strike missions, while two aircraft suffered damage from SA-7s over the Golan Heights.|$|E

5|$|On 3 November 1943, Brändle {{shot down}} two P-47 Thunderbolts fighters escorting a {{formation}} of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses {{on a mission}} targeting Wilhelmshaven. Later that day, {{he was killed in}} action west of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Following an attack by a group of Martin B-26 Marauders on Schiphol airfield, II. Gruppe <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> counter the attack. It is assumed that he was shot down in his Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-6 (Werknummer 26058—factory number) by Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) fighters under the command of Wing Commander Lloyd Chadburn. His body was later washed ashore near Zandvoort on 30 December 1943 and was buried at the Heroes Cemetery in Amsterdam (field 74, grave 405) one day later. His remains were moved in January 1944 before they were reinterred for a last time on 2 December 1947, this time at the cemetery Ysselsteyn (block CW, row 1, grave 25).|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, the 2nd Fighter Regiment {{continued to}} patrol over central Serbia, protecting factories at Kraljevo and Kragujevac from potential German air attacks that never occurred. The 4th Fighter Regiment was also active, patrolling over Bosnia and Croatia, but saw little action except for attempts to intercept German reconnaissance aircraft. Two of the Air Training School Hurricanes <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> intercept a small formation of Junkers Ju 88 bombers as they flew over Mostar towards Sarajevo. They were both hit by return fire, wounding one pilot and {{forcing him to}} crash land. The other pilot continued pursuing the bombers when he was attacked {{by a group of}} German Bf 109s. He was severely wounded, bailed out, and eventually died from loss of blood. Another Hurricane was also claimed by the Germans on 7 April.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> {{their feet}} and rushed forward while the sappers hurried {{to break down the}} sides of the antitank ditch with picks and shovels. They advanced on a series of posts held by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Italian 115th Infantry Regiment. Posts 49 and 47 were rapidly overrun, as was Post 46 in the second line beyond. Within half an hour Post 48 had also fallen and another company had taken Posts 45 and 44. The two remaining companies now advanced beyond these positions towards a low stone wall as artillery fire began to fall along the broken wire. The Italians fought from behind the wall until the Australians were inside it, attacking with hand grenades and bayonets. The two companies succeeded in taking 400 prisoners.|$|E

5|$|While the Koreans were {{advancing}} {{towards the}} Yalu River, the Chinese were {{also trying to}} deploy their units for the upcoming First Phase Campaign. As the PVA Commander Peng Dehuai <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> set up his new command post at Taeyudong, the planned advance by the ROK 2nd Infantry Regiment threatened to overrun his position. Without any KPA units nearby to hide {{the presence of the}} Chinese, Peng was forced to start the First Phase Campaign early by moving the PVA 40th Corps to intercept the ROK 2nd Infantry Regiment near Onjong. On the night of October 24, the 118th Division of the 40th Corps arrived at its designated blocking position. Meanwhile, the Chinese had set up numerous ambush positions on the ridges overlooking the Onjong-Pukchin road.|$|E
5|$|About 14:00 on 9 April, two Staffeln of German Messerschmitt Bf 109 {{fighters from}} II. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 54 were {{observed}} heading towards Nova Topola just as two IK-2s were landing after a patrol in poor flying weather. One of the IK-2s managed to overshoot and climbed to meet them, {{but the other}} was unable to, and had to complete its landing. Podnarednik (Junior Sergeant) Branko Jovanović used the extreme manoeuvrability of his IK-2 to avoid the nine Bf 109s that swooped in to attack, while a total of eight Hurricanes and five more IK-2s from the 4th Fighter Regiment <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> meet the Germans. For the following seven or eight minutes, a furious dogfight ensued over Novo Topola, during which two German aircraft were claimed and two Hurricanes and one IK-2 were lost. German records indicate that only one of their aircraft was lost, and that the pilot survived. Podnarednik Stikić survived {{the loss of his}} IK-2, but was badly wounded. The Germans, low on fuel, broke off and headed north.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 16 January, the seas were still rough, whilst hunger and panic had taken over on the wreck. When a large raft {{carrying}} the wounded, two women and six children was launched during a lull in the weather, over 120 unwounded men <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> board it. This severely overloaded the craft and within minutes a large wave struck the heavy raft and capsized it, drowning all aboard. By the evening, the remaining survivors, without food or fresh water, began to succumb to exposure, {{and at least one}} officer drowned {{in a desperate attempt to}} swim to shore. Throughout the night, the survivors gathered on the less exposed parts of the hull, and, in the hope of staving off death by dehydration, drank sea water, urine, or vinegar from a small barrel that had floated up from the hold. The morning of 17January finally saw a reduction in the storm and the arrival of a small French naval brig, the Arrogante. This ship could not come close without the risk of grounding but sent her boats to the wreck in the hope of rescuing survivors. The brig was joined later in the day by the cutter Aiguille.|$|E

5|$|Clemson's post-touchdown kickoff was bobbled by kick {{returner}} Andre Kendrick at the Tech one-yard line, but Kendrick {{broke free}} of the Clemson defense for a 34-yard return to the 35-yard line. Tech's first play after the return was an 11-yard run by Lee Suggs up {{the right side of}} the field. After the first down, Suggs ran straight ahead for a short gain, then Vick <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> the Clemson 37-yard line and another first down. Suggs then gained 18 yards on a run to the left side of the field. At the Clemson 19-yard line, Suggs was stopped for a loss of one yard, then Vick was sacked for a loss of five yards. The third-down play was an incomplete pass, and Carter Warley entered the game to attempt a 42-yard field goal. The kick bounced off the field goal crossbar but did not cross it, thus denying the Hokies three points. With 10:33 remaining in the half, Tech still had a 147 lead.|$|E
5|$|David Kaczynski {{had once}} admired and {{emulated}} his older brother, but had later {{decided to leave}} the survivalist lifestyle behind. He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking how they felt about going to the same high school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E
5|$|KG 53 {{approached}} North Weald {{from the}} east between Maldon, Essex and Rochford. No. 56 Squadron's 12 Hurricanes engaged the bombers, while No. 54 Squadron’s 11 Spitfires engaged the escorting Bf 109s and Bf 110s. In the engagement, at least one Bf 110 was shot down. The line of advance was now clear to the British ground controllers. Five Squadrons: No. 46, 85, 151, 257, and 310 with 61 Hurricanes, were <b>scrambled</b> <b>to</b> intercept the bombers in front of, or over the target. By 17:00 the airfield was covered in 5/10ths stratocumulus at 5,000 feet. Within thirty minutes the cloud base fell to just 3,500 feet. The German formation leaders soon realised {{that there was no}} hope of hitting a target from 12,000 feet, particularly when they could not see it. At 17:40, KG 53 turned away and headed for base. They had lost a single bomber to 56 Squadron. Things were about to change. As they turned around, 28 Hurricanes from Nos. 46, 85, and 151 Squadron prepared for a head-on attack. Meanwhile, 12 Hurricanes from 256 Squadron closed on the Germans from behind.|$|E
