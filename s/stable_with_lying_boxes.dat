The assumption of (i) implies that (2.4) has a unique interior steady state E^*=(x^*, y^*) and H^'(x^*)> 0. It can be shown that E^* is locally asymptotically stable since q̂_ 2 ^'(x^*)>q_ 1 ^'(x^*) by (3.5). Therefore, E^* is globally asymptotically stable in Γ and case 2 holds.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) {{interacts with}} {{two classes of}} high {{affinity}} binding sites on rat UMR cells cultured in monolayer. One class of binding sites {{was found to be}} localized in the extracellular matrix (ECM) after removal of cells from the culture dish. The interaction of LIF with ECM-localized binding sites is not dependent upon either glycosylation of LIF or the presence of extracellular glycosyaminoglycans. Chemical cross-linking studies demonstrate that LIF interacts with a 200 -kD cell-associated protein and a 140 -kD ECM-localized protein. A 140 -kD pro-tein could also be specifically precipitated from solubilised metabolically radiolabeled UMR ECM by antibodies directed against LIF by virtue of its ability to form a <b>stable</b> complex <b>with</b> unlabeled <b>LIE</b> In addition, soluble LIF associated with this ECM-localized protein is biologically active in terms of inhibition of ES cell differentiation. The properties of ECMlocalized 140 -kD species are very {{similar to those of the}} secreted form of the LIF receptor suggesting that the ECM localization of LIF and LIF signal transduction may be closely coupled. ~UKEmA inhibitory factor (LIF) ~ is a polypeptide regulatory factor which exhibits a broad range of biological activities on a wide variety of cell types in vitro. These include pluripotential embryonic stem cells (Smith et al., 1988), primordial germ cells (Matsui et al., 1992), myeloi...|$|R

40|$|A new all-sky imaging, {{wavelength}} scanning Fabry-Perot spectrometer (FPS) {{has been}} developed to spatially resolve horizontal vector wind fields in the thermosphere approximately 240 km above Poker Flat, Alaska. Collocated with this instrument are a narrow field Fabry-Perot spectrometer, a 30 frame/s white light all-sky video camera (ASC) and a 4 -channel meridian scanning photometer (MSP). The narrow field FPS is normally used for vertical wind measurements, whereas the latter two instruments are used to monitor auroral activity. We present an example of data from this set of instruments from one night, November 15, 1996. In particular, we focus on a three hour period, ending just after magnetic midnight, during which time an auroral breakup was observed. Strong curvature and shear of the horizontal wind field developed prior to the breakup, apparently associated <b>with</b> <b>stable</b> aurora <b>lying</b> north of Poker Flat. The curved and sheared flow configuration collapsed within 45 min of the breakup, leaving the thermospheric wind almost stagnant. Following this, the observatory moved under the thermospheric cross-polar jet, so that uniform southeastward wind gradually covered our visible sky. The vertical wind speed remained within a few tens of ms^ 1 of zero throughout this period, apart from an isolated value of 82 ms^ 1 downward, recorded about 50 min prior to the breakup. Mechanisms for possible associations between thermospheric vertical winds, horizontal winds, and the aurora are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determined if the 227 ha used in the cultivated soils of the five different stables destined for the production of milk and specimens of the Holstein Friestan stock found in Guadiana valley in Durango are affected by the well waters used in irrigation and the residual waters of the automatic milking process. The variables of the study included: apparent density (Da), total Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sodium (Na), Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg). The experimental period consisted of 3 consecutive days in each of the production units using the method of cutting for the recollection of the samples consisting of soil, for its future analysis in a lab. The obtained results were processed through the program of statistics (SAS) Version 8 with a module completely at random. Analyzing the results between each stable the variable measurements can be observed in the tables from 1 through 5. The variables found in the comparison between the five production units were: density, the <b>stable</b> <b>with</b> the highest amount was stable 2 and the <b>stable</b> <b>with</b> the least was the <b>stable</b> 1 <b>with</b> a difference between the stables of high significance; recorded in the table provided (p< 0. 05).
