40|$|The use of gypsum, and to {{a lesser}} extent, lime to {{mitigate}} sodicity in dryland agriculture has been shown as viable. However, under an increased water application (i. e. irrigation) the dissolution of gypsum could be expected to be more rapid.

This study investigates the effects of various rates of lime, gypsum and lime/gypsum combinations on an irrigated sodic Brown Vertosol in western NSW.

While much of this ExNa was lixiviated with the rainwater washes, the soil exhibited significant remaining exchangeable <b>sodium</b> <b>percentages</b> (ESP).

40|$|Australia has {{the largest}} ratio of salt-affected soils with respect to total surface area of any {{continent}} in the world. The processes of dryland salinity (which results from an increase in salts in solution) and consequent sodicity (where the soil complexes {{have high levels of}} adsorbed Na+, i. e. exchangeable <b>sodium</b> <b>percentages</b> ≥ 6) are major land and water degradation issues, particularly within the Murray-Darling Basin. In the catchments of southeast New South Wales such processes significantly impact on both agricultural production and water quality in the river systems. While the sources of salt found in the landscape have been debated by many workers, the general consensus is that the major contribution comes from precipitation, although attempts at direct comparison against other potential sources such as mineral weathering or aeolian dust are few in eastern Australia. This study assessed the contributions of various salt sources of the regolith in the Upper Billabong Creek Catchment (UBCC) of southeast New South Wales, and how these salts are stored and released in the environment. Such information is valuable in land and water resource decision-making, both within the catchment and in similar environments in neighbouring catchments, particularly with regards to prominent environmental issues such as soil sodicity, waterlogging and dryland salinity (Woodward-Clyde 1999, NLWRA 2001) ...|$|R
40|$|Scientists {{studying}} badland {{processes in}} Mediterranean and Semi-arid climates require assurances {{that the material}} in which gullies are presented is not dispersive. A dispersive context means; first, infiltration rates may be radically changing in very short periods due to swelling and deflocculation of clays; second, surface crusts could {{be the result of}} translocation of sodium into subsurface positions; third, rills may be formed or at least exacerbated by shallow subsurface erosion; fourth, large gullies with substantial up-channel headcuts, including so-called ‘bank gullies’, may have formed because subsurface pipes have collapsed; and fifth, that network connectivity and evolution may be principally internal, being effected by subsurface pipe capture network integration; and most importantly, the bulk of the sediment moving around in the landscape is not being lost from the surface. This paper presents a decision-support tool to assist the effective diagnosis of a landscape's principal genetic process suite.

Magnesium, potassium and sodium were determined with an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer while sulphate was determined using a spectrophotometer.

The {{results show that the}} mean values of all the parameters were higher in dry season compared to the wet season except for pH.

In this study, secondary treated wastewater (STW) from an anaerobic/facultative pond system at the city of Lins (São Paulo State, Brazil) was used over 3 years and 7 months to irrigate coffee (Coffea arabica L.). The soil type was Typic Haplustox and the crops were fertilized according to regional agronomical recommendations. Soil and leaf samples from three sampling campaigns were used to study effects on chemical quality parameters, macronutrients and Na within the soil–plant system. Due to high Na contents of the STW applied, Na concentrations showed increases throughout the soil profile compared to untreated soil conditions. Both, low C/N ratio of STW and fertilizer amendments stimulated soil microbial activity and encouraged nitrification and mineralization of wastewater organic components and soil organic matter (SOM) causing significant decreases of SOM and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Over time exchangeable <b>sodium</b> <b>percentages</b> (ESP) in the topsoil decreased due to Na exchange mainly by Ca and Mg, resulting in increasing exchangeable calcium percentage (ECP) and exchangeable magnesium percentage (EMP) associated with lower soil sodicity. Exchanged Na and available soluble Na from STW led to both elevated ESP at depth by soil migration and high plant uptake. The superficial increase of ECP and EMP favored continuous replenishment of Ca and Mg in the soil solution leading to increasing plant contents over time. The plant Ca, Mg and K contents remained high after fertilization stop and continued STW irrigation. This {{is expected to be}} rather a short-lived effect due to a reduction of the essential cation store through constantly provided Na and insufficient supply of essential cations via STW, associated with decrease of SOM and CEC and higher sodicity risk, suggesting the need of continued fertilizer use for soil maintenance. On the other hand, the plant contents of P, N and S dropped back to deficient values when irrigated solely with STW mainly due to insufficient replenishment by STW and the anion exchange complex (AEC) indicating moreover the need to continue fertilization to maintain anion levels in soil for optimum plant growth. The study revealed that STW can effectively increase water resources for irrigation, however, innovative and adapted fertilizer/STW management strategies are needed to diminish sodicity risks and to sustain adequate and balanced nutritional conditions in the soil–plant system...|$|R

Application of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), as a nitric oxide (NO) donor, revealed that NO affected element ratios in both DR and SR calluses in a concentration-dependent manner. Nω-nitro-l-arginine (an NO synthase inhibitor) and 2 -phenyl- 4, 4, 5, 5 -tetramethyl-imidazoline- 1 -oxyl- 3 -oxyde (a specific NO scavenger) counteracted NO effect by increasing the Na percentage, decreasing the calcium percentage and the K to Na ratio.
