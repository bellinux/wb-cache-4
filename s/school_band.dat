5|$|Ely was {{enrolled}} at Washington High School in Portland, Oregon. He {{did not play}} in the <b>school</b> <b>band,</b> but had a passion for singing. In 1959, Lynn Easton's mother invited him to play at a Portland hotel gig, with Ely singing and playing guitar with the backup band and Easton on the drum kit. The two teenagers grew up together, as their parents were close friends. Easton and Ely performed at yacht club parties, and soon added Mike Mitchell on guitar and Bob Nordby on bass to round out a band. They called themselves The Kingsmen, taking the name from a recently disbanded group. The Kingsmen began their collective career playing at fashion shows, Red Cross events, and supermaket promotions, generally avoiding rock songs on their setlist. Ely played with the Kingsmen as he attended Portland State University.|$|E

He also worked at a local meat market, a service station, and a clothing store. He occasionally spent time at a local airport in Bedford, Indiana, where he first became interested in flying. A local attorney who owned a small plane would take him on flights for a $1 fee and taught him the basics of flying.|$|E
5|$|Music is an {{important}} part of education in the United States, and is a part of most or all school systems in the country. Music education is generally mandatory in public elementary schools, and is an elective in later years. High schools generally offer classes in singing, mostly choral, and instrumentation in the form of a large <b>school</b> <b>band.</b> Music may also be a part of theatrical productions put on by a school's drama department. Many public and private schools have sponsored music clubs and groups, most commonly including the marching band that performs at high school sports games, a trend that began with the wide popularity of Sousa's bands in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E

5|$|Once {{he began}} to play football, as a junior, he {{achieved}} instant success as a running back, running 65 {{yards for a touchdown}} on his first high school carry. At , he was not especially large, but his speed and strength {{made him one of the}} team's featured players. John J. Jefferson High School was integrated with neighboring Columbia High School that year; Payton and his teammates were upset that their head coach, Charles L. Boston, had become an assistant and Payton boycotted some of the spring practices in protest, but returned during the fall season. He then earned statewide honors as a member of Mississippi's all-state team, leading Columbia to an unexpected 8–2 season. His performance helped ease the local tensions surrounding desegregation. Tommy Davis, Columbia’s football coach, claimed that he could always count on Payton when the team needed to score. Payton’s statistics proved that was no exaggeration: he scored in every game during his junior and senior years. He was named to the all-conference team two years in a row. Payton also led the Little Dixie Conference in scoring his senior year and made the all-state team. In addition to excelling at football, Payton averaged 18 points a game for Columbia’s basketball team, leaped three-quarters of an inch short of 23 feet in the long jump, played baseball, and continued to drum in the <b>school</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{last piece}} of live music played in the hall, on 14 February 1982, was a {{performance}} by the Glossop <b>School</b> <b>Band,</b> who were {{taking part in the}} North West Amateur Brass Band Championship in front of a crowd of 1,700. The hall had been sold 18 months earlier to a development company, Espley Tyas Development Group, and was by then scheduled for demolition to allow the site to be redeveloped. News of the sale had triggered the formation of local action groups, who organised a petition signed by 50,000 people in an unsuccessful effort to save the hall. The exhibition halls were sold to Mullet Ltd. in 1983, but competition from the newly opened G-Mex exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester led directly to their closure. The site was sold to the British Car Auction Group in 1987, and the buildings demolished {{to make way for a}} large car auction centre.|$|E
