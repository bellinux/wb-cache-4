40|$|Objective: Parapneumonic pleural effusions show a wide range, from minimal-un{{complicated}} pleural effusions to complicated effusions and empyema. At {{the present}} time, {{the use and}} benefit of intrapleural streptokinase in complicated cases, in addition to closed chest tube drainage and thoracoscopic methods, is still contraversial. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of intrapleural streptokinase in parapneumonic pleural effusions. Material and Method: A total of 42 patients treated for complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema, and having tube thoracostomy in the period of January 2000 -December 2007, were included in the study. Properties of the cases were evaluated retrospectively. Mann-Withney U, Student-t and Fischer’s Exact tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: Twenty-two cases who had multiloculation detected by ultrasonography and/or culture positive pleural effusion, received intrapleural streptokinase, and 20 cases without septation or culture positivity had tube thoracostomy only. Statistically,there was no difference between the two groups for sex, age and comorbid disease. Success rate (complete lung expansion and chest tube removal) in the intrapleural streptokinase group was 86. 4 %, and 80 %in the group with chest tube drainage only. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups for hospital <b>stay,</b> <b>tube</b> thoracostomy duration, complication incidence and decortication need (p> 0, 05). Conclusion: Our study showed that use of intrapleural streptokinase in complicated (culture positive and/or loculated) parapneumonic effusion and empyema were an effective treatment when cases were selected precisely, and it did not increase hospital stay and period of drainage compared to the second group...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pleural empyema is a {{well known}} {{complication}} of pneumonia. Attitudes differ, however, about the best treatment of this condition and the place of drainage, early operation, and local antibiotics. METHODS: In a retrospective study 94 consecutive patients with verified empyema caused by pneumonia were admitted {{to the department of}} either pulmonary medicine or thoracic surgery. Treatment was either by a lavage regimen (daily thoracocentesis, saline rinse, systemic antibiotics, and in some patients instillation of local antibiotics) in the medical ward (51 patients) or by tube drainage and systemic antibiotics in the surgical unit (43 patients). RESULTS: The stay in hospital was significantly shorter in the medically treated patients than in the surgical group [...] 2. 3 v 5. 0 weeks respectively. Furthermore, pleurocutaneous and bronchopleural fistulas developed more frequently in patients treated by tube drainage than in those treated with the thoracocentesis regimen alone (13 (30 %) v 5 (10 %) and 6 (14 %) v 2 (4 %) for each complication respectively). The overall mortality was 8. 5 % with no differences between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with a lavage regimen plus local and systemic antibiotics seems to be associated with a lower frequency of complications and a shorter duration of hospital <b>stay</b> than <b>tube</b> drainage and systemic antibiotics. These results should be confirmed by a prospective, randomised study...|$|R
25|$|Four {{accounts}} of Berti's experiment exist, but a simple model of his experiment consisted of filling with water a long tube that had both ends plugged, then standing the tube in a basin already full of water. The bottom {{end of the}} tube was opened, and water that had been inside of it poured out into the basin. However, {{only part of the}} water in the tube flowed out, and the level of the water inside the <b>tube</b> <b>stayed</b> at an exact level, which happened to be 10.3m, the same height Baliani and Galileo had observed that was limited by the siphon. What was most important about this experiment was that the lowering water had left a space above it in the tube which had no intermediate contact with air to fill it up. This seemed to suggest the possibility of a vacuum existing in the space above the water.|$|R

50|$|Chest {{tubes are}} usually {{inserted}} under local anesthesia.

The tube is placed through this passage. If necessary, patients may be given additional analgesics for the procedure.

Methods: The netrospective study included the review of 39 cases who had presented with spontaneous pneumothorax at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan, between January 2001 to November 2008 and had undergone video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Results: The duration of hospital stay (had a range of 3 to 9 days), {{and the length of}} chest tube in place (a range of 2 to 8 days), 2 (5. 1 %) patients developed recurrence after VATS while 3 (7. 6 %) patients developed bleeding post operatively requiring transfusion and 2 (5. 1 %) patients developed atelectasis requiring bronchoscopy. Conclusion: Compared with figures for thoracotomy data from other studies, it was seen that the length of hospital <b>stay</b> and chest <b>tube</b> placement with VATS was less than that for thoracotomy, and the overall cost as well as post-operative pain was also low.

40|$|BACKGROUND Major {{trauma is}} the fourth {{cause of death in}} Western countries, and the first one in {{patients}} aged 35 years or younger. In-hospital post-intensive care represents a crucial step in the comprehensive medical assistance for these patients, but no data is available. AIM OF THE STUDY To evaluate an hospital post-intensive clinical pathway for patients with major trauma discharged from Intensive Care Unit (ICU). PATIENTS AND METHODS We designed a clinical pathway project for patients with major trauma discharged from an ICU at Careggi Hospital, in Florence. Patients were admitted in two Internal Medical wards of the same hospital. Nurses and physicians were trained to the management of devices and essential critical problems. We analysed characteristics of patients, APACHE score, devices, clinical and biochemical parameters. We determined medical complicances, ICU readmissions and hospital mortality. After a three months follow-up we evaluated hospital readmission, mortality and residual disability. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We studied 92 patients (mean age 41 ± 20 years; 70 male) with major trauma discharged from ICU (82. 6 % of patients underwent invasive mechanic ventilation). On admission, tracheotomy tube was present in 21 patients (22. 8 %). During internal wards <b>stay,</b> tracheotomy <b>tube</b> was removed in 16 patients. Medical complicances were identified and treated in more than 80 % of patients. Four patients (4. 3 %) were readmitted to ICU, one patient (1. 1 %) died. Mean internal medical ward stay was 13 ± 9. 6 days. After three months follow-up: three patients (3. 2 %) died; the rate of planned hospital readmission for orthopedic or surgery interventions was 14. 7 %; 70 % of patients did not have any disability. CONCLUSIONS Patients with major trauma discharged from ICU often have medical complications and are managed by the use of multiple devices. Results of our pilot study suggest that a post-intensive clinical pathway in internal wards for patients with major trauma is feasible and could reduce ICU readmissions and hospital mortality...|$|R
40|$|Background/PurposeFew {{studies have}} {{examined}} the surgical outcomes of mediastinal mature teratoma in Taiwan. In the present study, the clinicopathological characteristics of mature teratoma and their impact on surgical outcome were analyzed. MethodsFrom 1988 to 2005, 57 cases of mediastinal mature teratoma were reviewed. We collected and analyzed data about patient age, sex, symptoms, blood sugar, pulmonary function, diagnosis, tumor size, histopathological features, operative methods, operative time, tumor adhesion, blood loss, ventilator requirement, intensive care unit <b>stay,</b> chest <b>tube</b> requirement, and postoperative hospital stay. ResultsThere were 18 male and 39 female patients with a median age of 27 years. Forty-three patients received conventional open surgery, whereas 14 received video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. The patients in the thoracoscopic group had a decreased operative time (106. 4 ± 35. 7 min vs. 205. 4 ± 75. 7 min, p = 0. 038), fewer ventilator days (0. 2 ± 0. 4 vs. 0. 5 ± 0. 8, p = 0. 034), and a shorter stay {{in the intensive care unit}} (0. 6 ± 0. 8 days vs. 1. 5 ± 1. 4 days, p = 0. 030). Pancreatic tissue was identified in 21 of 57 tumors (36. 8 %). The patients with tumors that contained pancreatic tissue had more presenting symptoms and complicated surgery than those whose tumors were without pancreatic tissue (76. 2 % vs. 33. 3 %, p = 0. 002, and 42. 9 % vs. 11. 1 %, p = 0. 008). The patients with symptoms had a higher incidence of complicated surgery than those without (39. 3 % vs. 6. 9 %, p = 0. 004). ConclusionMediastinal mature teratoma commonly occurs in young women. Thoracoscopic surgery is a feasible technique for mediastinal mature teratoma resection if no dense adhesions are found during preoperative assessment. The presence of symptoms might be a relative contraindication for thoracoscopic teratoma resection because of its association with surgical complications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Randomized trials {{comparing}} VATS lobectomy to open lobectomy are {{of small}} size. We analyzed a case-control series using propensity score-weighting {{to adjust for}} important covariates in order to compare the clinical outcomes of the two techniques. Methods We compared patients undergoing lobectomy for clinical stage I lung cancer (NSCLC) by either VATS or open (THOR) methods. Inverse probability of treatment weighted estimators, with weights derived from propensity scores, were used to adjust cohorts for determinants of perioperative morbidity and mortality including age, gender, preop FEV 1, ASA class, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Bootstrap methods provided standard errors. Endpoints were postoperative <b>stay</b> (LOS), chest <b>tube</b> duration, complications, and lymph node retrieval. Results We analyzed 136 consecutive lobectomy patients. Operative mortality was 1 / 62 (1. 6 %) for THOR and 1 / 74 (1. 4 %) for VATS, P = 1. 00. 5 / 74 (6. 7 %) VATS were converted to open procedures. Adjusted median LOS was 7 days (THOR) versus 4 days (VATS), P Conclusions After balancing covariates that affect morbidity, mortality and LOS in this case-control series using propensity-weighting, the results confirm that VATS lobectomy {{is associated with a}} statistically significant shorter LOS, similar mortality and complication rates and similar rates of lymph node removal in patients with clinical stage I NSCLC. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Surgical {{correction}} {{needs to}} be considered when diaphragm eventration leads to impaired ventilation and respiratory muscle fatigue. Plication to sufficiently tense the diaphragm by VATS is not as easy to achieve as plication by open surgery. We used pneumatic compression with carbon dioxide (CO 2) gas in thoracoscopic diaphragmatic plication and evaluated feasibility and efficacy. Methods: Eleven patients underwent thoracoscopic diaphragmatic plication between January 2008 and December 2013 in Pusan National University Hospital. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed, and compared between the group using CO 2 gas and group without using CO 2 gas, for operative time, plication technique, duration of hospital <b>stay,</b> postoperative chest <b>tube</b> drainage, pulmonary spirometry, dyspnea score pre- and postoperation, and postoperative recurrence. Results: The improvement of forced expiratory volume at 1 second in the group using CO 2 gas and the group not using CO 2 gas was 22. 46 ± 11. 27 and 21. 08 ± 5. 39 (p= 0. 84). The improvement of forced vital capacity 3 months after surgery was 16. 74 ± 10. 18 (with CO 2) and 15. 6 ± 0. 89 (without CO 2) (p= 0. 03). During follow-up (17 ± 17 months), there was no dehiscence in plication site and relapse. No complications or hospital mortalities occurred.

40|$|Sucrose {{solution}} is recommended as relevant pain relief management in neonates during acute painful procedures; however, {{only a few}} studies have analyzed the potentially adverse effects of sucrose administration to preterm neonates. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine the potential side effects of sucrose for pain relief in preterm infants, assessing feeding and weight gain during hospitalization and their feeding patterns postdischarge. The study sample consisted of 43 preterm neonates divided into two groups: a sucrose group (SG, n= 18) and a control group (CG, n= 25) in which no sucrose was administered. The SG received 0. 5 mL/kg 25 % oral sucrose for 2 min prior to all acute painful procedures during three consecutive days. A prospective review of medical charts was performed for all samples. The study was done prior to implementation of the institutional sucrose guidelines as a routine service, and followed all ethical requirements. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of weight gain, length of <b>stay</b> with orogastric <b>tubes,</b> and parenteral feeding. Postdischarge, infant nutritional intake included feeding human milk to 67 % of the SG and 74 % of the CG.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} previous unsuccessful extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) treatment on the performance and outcome of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Patients and methods: Of 1625 PCNL procedures performed in our clinic, 393 renal units with similar stone burden and number of accesses {{was included in the}} present study. We categorised the study patients into two groups according to whether they underwent ESWL within 1  year prior to PCNL or not. Accordingly, Group 1 comprised 143 (36. 3 %) ESWL-treated patients and Group 2 comprised 250 (63. 7 %) non-ESWL-treated patients. Results: Residual stones were detected in 36 (25. 1 %) of the ESWL-treated patients (Group 1) and in 60 (24 %) of non-ESWL-treated patients (Group 2). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups for length of hospital <b>stay</b> (LOS), nephrostomy <b>tube</b> removal time, and the presence of residual stones. When we evaluated the groups for both the preoperative and postoperative haemoglobin (Hb) drop and blood transfusion rate, manifest Hb declines and more transfusions were required in the ESWL-treated patients (both P =  0. 01). Conclusions: In our study, previous ESWL treatment had no influence on the PCNL stone-free rate, operation time, incidence of postoperative complications, and LOS, in patients with similar stone burdens. However, bleeding during PCNL was more prevalent in the ESWL-treated patients, so close attention should be paid to bleeding in patients who have been pretreated with ESWL...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{minimize}} {{air leak}} after anatomical lung resections, many video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) surgeons use a 'fissureless' technique, using staplers {{to divide the}} hilar bronchovascular structures first and {{the main part of}} the fissure last. We describe a cohort of 198 consecutive patients operated with an alternative fissureless technique, opening the fissure completely with staplers at an early stage of the VATS anatomical lung resection. METHODS To open the incomplete fissure first and with staplers, a tunnel dissection is started anterior between the triangle of pulmonary veins and the parenchyma. After identification of the pulmonary artery, the anvil of a first stapler is placed on top of the artery and the anterior part of the fissure is divided. Dissection between artery and parenchyma is continued until the fissure is completely stapled. From a prospectively managed single institution database, we retrieved 405 patients scheduled for VATS anatomical resection between October 2009 and December 2014. The patients were categorized in four consecutive periods: a learning curve with the first 50 cases of VATS lobectomy technique (LC), a period of consecutive 'hilum first, fissure last' (HF), a transition group (TG) during which both techniques were used and a period of consecutive 'fissure first, hilum last' (FF). RESULTS No significant differences in operating time, frequency of prolonged air leak or hospital stay were observed between HF (n = 45) and FF (n = 198). Chest tubes were removed earlier in the FF period (6. 9 vs 5. 2 days, P = 0. 025). Excluding the learning curve, we found 2 patients (2. 8 %) operated 'hilum first' with an intraoperative complication that potentially could have been avoided by a 'fissure first' technique. CONCLUSIONS By making a tunnel between the bronchovascular structures and parenchyma from anteriorly to posteriorly, one can open the fissure completely with staplers at an early stage of an anatomical lung resection. This combines the advantages of both the 'fissureless' hilum first technique and classic (open) fissure first dissection, i. e. minimal air leak and optimal anatomical overview before bronchovascular structures are divided, potentially avoiding inadvertent transections. A cohort of 198 consecutive patients operated with this alternative fissureless technique demonstrates the feasibility and non-inferiority regarding hospital <b>stay,</b> chest <b>tube</b> duration, operation time and complications in comparison with the hilum first technique.

Specificity and sensitivity of tests were examined by ROC curve. Results: Mean time of ICU and ward stay (day) was 3. 89 and 11. 07 days respectively. The mean volume of transfused blood in group 1 (ICU stay≤ 3 day) was 694 ml and in group 2 (> 3 day) was 1231 ml where the difference was significant (p< 0 / 05) and this correlation between stay time and transfusion was not seen in ward stay. In univariate analysis, factors such as transfused volume, maximum flow, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Ejection fraction (EF), Intra aorta pump (IABP) and drainage volume were different between two groups of ICU stay times and such factors in ward stay were transfused volume, minimum flow, COPD, reoperation due to bleeding, and amount of 24 hours bleeding. In logistic regression model variables such as age, pump time, transfused volume and COPD were predictors of ICU stay and only drainage volume was predictor of ward stay. Conclusion: Transfusion of blood is associated with long ICU stay time. Mechanism of this increased time is depression of immune system and increased rate of infection. Volume of bleeding from chest tube in 24 hours is associated with long hospital <b>stay,</b> because chest <b>tube</b> dose not pull out until drainage volume reduced to 50 ml in 24 h...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundUreteropelvic {{junction}} obstruction (UPJO) is {{a common}} congenital urinary tract anomaly causing hydronephrosis in children. Laparoscopic pyeloplasty has become a popular and effective method to treat UPJO both in children and adults, but seems controversial in neonates or infants. Materials and methodsFrom January 2007 to May 2012, patients with UPJO aged < 18 years undergoing operations at our institute were included in this study. By retrospectively reviewing medical charts, the demographic data, presentation, laterality, etiology, operative time, length of hospital <b>stay,</b> stents, drainage <b>tubes,</b> and postoperative complications were recorded. Surgical outcomes were evaluated based on renal sonography and Lasix diuretic renography. ResultsA total of 47 patients (40 boys and 7 girls) were enrolled initially, but seven patients who were complicated with other congenital anomalies of the urinary system or who underwent surgery at other hospitals were excluded. Among these 40 patients, 21 had open pyeloplasty (Group I), eight who were younger than 1 year old or weighed < 10  kg had a hybrid procedure (Group II), and 19 had laparoscopic surgery (Group III). The mean age was younger in Groups I and II because the selected procedure was nonrandomized. The operative time and the duration of perianastomotic drainage were longer in Groups II and III. There {{was no significant difference}} with regard to successful resolution of UPJO among the three groups. ConclusionIn infants or young children (< 1 year old or weighing < 10  kg) with UPJO, the hybrid procedure of pyeloplasty may be considered as a safe, effective, and less time-consuming alternative to laparoscopic surgery, and most importantly, confirms the security of the anastomosis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Comparison of Amplatz sheath {{percutaneous}} nephrolithotomy (Amplatz PCNL) {{and metal}} telescopic dilation PCNL (MTD PCNL) {{with respect to}} clinical outcomes and complications. Materials and Methods: Single-institution retrospective chart review with 73 patients who underwent PCNL divided into two groups: Amplatz PCNL (n = 26) and MTD PCNL (n = 47). Efficacy (stone-free rate, residual stones, and surgical duration) and safety (transfusion rate and hemoglobin decrease) were evaluated. Complications were recorded and classified using the modified Clavien classification system. Results: The two PCNL groups were similar regarding mean age, stone burden, side, stone location, and stone composition. There {{were no significant differences}} in surgery duration (101 ± 28 vs. 98 ± 30 min; P = 0. 906), transfusion rate (3. 9 % vs. 4. 3 %; P = 0. 382), and hemoglobin drop (0. 9 ± 0. 9 vs. 1 ± 0. 7 g/dl; P = 0. 424) for Amplatz and MTD PCNL, respectively. Stone-free rate (86 % vs. 68 %; P = 0. 001) was significantly higher while residual fragments rate (37 % vs. 60 %; P = 0. 001) was significantly lower in Amplatz PCNL compared to MTD PCNL. However, <b>tube</b> <b>stay</b> time (4. 4 ± 1. 8 vs. 5. 8 ± 3. 6 days; P = 0. 005) and hospital time (8. 6 ± 2. 6 vs. 9. 7 ± 5. 5 days; P = 0. 0001) were significantly longer in Amplatz PCNL compared to MTD PCNL. Clavien grading revealed a significantly higher rate of low-grade complications (I–III) for the MTD PCNL in comparison to Amplatz PCNL (10. 6 % vs. 3. 9 %, respectively; P = 0. 011). There were no major complications and no tract dilation failure. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that Amplatz PCNL is a safe and effective procedure to remove large renal stones compared with MTD PCNL...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{determined}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} TachoSil (R) in sealing the tract after percutaneous nephrolithotomy compared to nephrostomy tube placement. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 consecutive patients scheduled for percutaneous nephrolithotomy were randomized 1 : 1 to receive a 16 Fr nephrostomy tube (group 1) or TachoSil in the tract (group 2). All patients received a mono-J ureteral catheter. The primary study end points were bleeding and urinary leakage rates. The secondary end points were pain as assessed by the 0 to 10 -point visual analog scale, analgesic requirement and hospital stay. Results: The groups were comparable for preoperative and operative variables. In group 1, 3 patients were excluded intraoperatively because of relevant bleeding, and in group 2, 1 patient was excluded intraoperatively because of hydrothorax. Tract complications were significantly more frequent in group 1 than in group 2 (25. 5 % vs 2 %, p < 0. 001). However, the difference in urinary leakage reached statistical significance (19. 1 % vs 2 %, p = 0. 007), whereas that in perirenal hematoma formation did not (6. 4 % vs 0 %, p = 0. 113). There {{was no difference between}} the groups in mean +/- SD number of analgesic doses (1. 17 +/- 1. 56 vs 1. 20 +/- 1. 69, p = 0. 791) and visual analogue scale scores (4. 77 +/- 2. 28 vs 4. 24 +/- 2. 32, p = 0. 270). Postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in group 2 than in group 1 (5. 15 +/- 1. 74 vs 2. 75 +/- 1. 78 days, p < 0. 0001). Conclusions: Although failing to reduce pain and analgesic requirement, TachoSil provided better tract control and a shorter hospital <b>stay</b> than nephrostomy <b>tube</b> placement, thus allowing the extension of indications for tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy to most procedure...|$|R
40|$|The ideal {{invasive}} {{management as}} initial approach for pneumothorax (PTX) {{is still under}} debate. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis {{was to examine the}} evidence for the effectiveness of intercostal tube drainage and other various invasive methods as the initial approach to all subtypes of PTX in adults. Three databases were searched from inception to May 29, 2016 : MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL. Randomised controlled trials that evaluated intercostal tube drainage as the control and various invasive methods as the intervention for the initial approach to PTX in adults were included. The primary outcome was the early success rate of each method, and the risk ratios (RRs) were used for an effect size measure. The secondary outcomes were recurrence rate, hospitalization rate, hospital stay, and complications. Seven studies met our inclusion criteria. Interventions were aspiration in six studies and catheterization connected to a one-way valve in one study. Meta-analyses were conducted for early success rate, recurrence rate, hospitalization rate, and hospital stay. Aspiration was inferior to intercostal tube drainage in terms of early success rate (RR = 0. 82, confidence interval [CI] = 0. 72 to 0. 95, I 2 = 0 %). While aspiration and intercostal tube drainage showed {{no significant difference in the}} recurrence rate (RR = 0. 84, CI = 0. 57 to 1. 23, I 2 = 0 %), aspiration had shorter hospital <b>stay</b> than intercostal <b>tube</b> drainage (mean difference = - 1. 73, CI = - 2. 33 to - 1. 13, I 2 = 0 %). Aspiration had lower hospitalization rate than intercostal tube drainage, but marked heterogeneity was present (RR = 0. 38, CI = 0. 19 to 0. 76, I 2 = 85 %). Aspiration was inferior to intercostal tube drainage in terms of early resolution, but it had shorter hospital stay. The recurrence rate of aspiration and intercostal tube drainage did not differ significantly. The efficacy of catheterization connected to a one-way valve was inconclusive because of the small number of relevant studies. (Registration of study protocol: PROSPERO, CRD 42016037866) ...|$|R
40|$|Karst {{aquifers}} evolve {{where the}} dissolution of soluble rocks causes the enlargement of discrete pathways along fractures or bedding planes, thus creating highly conductive solution conduits. To identify general interrelations between hydrogeological conditions and {{the properties of the}} evolving conduit systems the aperture-size frequency distributions resulting from generic models of conduit evolution are analysed. For this purpose, a process-based numerical model coupling flow and rock dissolution is employed. Initial protoconduits are represented by tubes with log-normally distributed aperture sizes with a mean &mu; 0 = 0. 5 mm for the logarithm of the diameters. Apertures are spatially uncorrelated and widen up to the metre range due to dissolution by chemically aggressive waters. Several examples of conduit development are examined focussing on influences of the initial heterogeneity and the available amount of recharge. If the available recharge is sufficiently high the evolving conduits compete for flow and those with large apertures and high hydraulic gradients attract more and more water. As a consequence, the positive feedback between increasing flow and dissolution causes the breakthrough of a conduit pathway connecting the recharge and discharge sides of the modelling domain. Under these competitive flow conditions dynamically stable bimodal aperture distributions are found to evolve, i. e. a certain percentage of tubes continues to be enlarged while the remaining <b>tubes</b> <b>stay</b> small-sized. The percentage of strongly widened tubes is found to be independent of the breakthrough time and decreases with increasing heterogeneity of the initial apertures and decreasing amount of available water. If the competition for flow is suppressed because the availability of water is strongly limited breakthrough of a conduit pathway is inhibited and the conduit pathways widen very slowly. The resulting aperture distributions are found to be unimodal covering some orders of magnitudes in size. Under these suppressed flow conditions the entire range of apertures continues to be enlarged. Hence, the number of tubes reaching aperture sizes in the order of centimetres or decimetres continues to increase with time and in the long term may exceed the number of large-sized tubes evolving under competitive flow conditions. This suggests that conduit development under suppressed flow conditions may significantly enhance the permeability of the formation, e. g. in deep-seated carbonate settings...|$|R
