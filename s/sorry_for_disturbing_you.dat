6000|$|... "I {{can only}} {{apologize}} <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you</b> {{at such an}} hour," [...] he answered, taking up his hat. [...] "I {{could think of nothing}} else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you,</b> Dr. Therne," [...] she said, [...] "but {{you really}} must look," [...] and she pointed {{through the window}} of the coach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Marcus," [...] she repeated, {{dwelling}} {{a little}} on the unfamiliar name, [...] "I beg that you will forgive me <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you</b> at so unseasonable an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Duge," [...] {{the young}} man exclaimed, [...] "forgive me <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you,</b> but I {{think that if you}} feel strong enough you ought to come downstairs into the library at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know I presumed too far,' said Lord St. Erme, pausing; 'I {{ask your}} pardon <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you.</b> It was selfish; but I {{could not let}} you go without once {{adverting}} to the subject--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] he {{answered}} in a rich, and to Rachel's astonishment, perfectly educated voice, [...] "forgive me <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you.</b> I am ashamed, but it is necessary. The Zulus--" [...] and he paused.|$|R
6000|$|... "I must apologise <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you</b> {{at such an}} hour," [...] he said, as he {{took the}} tumbler which Dominey pressed into his hand. [...] "I have only just {{received}} Lady Dominey's telegram. I had to see you--at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must {{apologize}} <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you</b> at dinner, Angela," [...] {{she began}} hurriedly, {{and then stopped}} and also stood still. There was something very curious about her reception, she thought; both Mr. Fraser and Angela might have been cut out of stone, for neither moved.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] he said stiffly, [...] "that {{these are}} the apartments of Miss Pellissier. I must {{apologize}} <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you</b> at such an unseemly hour, but I should be very much obliged if Miss Pellissier would allow me a few minutes' conversation. My name is Ferringhall--Sir John Ferringhall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} mind, Arbuthnot, I wish {{that you would}} get up. The Glittering Lady (he still called her that) is coming here to {{have a talk with}} me which I should prefer to be private. Excuse me <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you,</b> but you have {{overslept}} yourself; indeed, I think it must be nine o'clock, so far as I can judge by the sun, for my watch is very erratic now, ever since Bickley tried to clean it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{really are}} heartily ashamed of {{ourselves}} <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you</b> {{at such an}} hour, Sir George," [...] the man said, [...] "but you will pardon us when you understand the position. I am the Marquis de St. Ethol, {{and this is my}} wife. I have a letter to you from my friend the Duke of Chestow, with whom we have been staying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray {{excuse me}} <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you.</b> I am obliged {{to leave the}} house on one of my {{tiresome}} domestic errands. If you will kindly permit it, I wish to express, before I go, my very sincere regret for what I was rude enough to say, when I last had the honor of seeing you. May I hope to be forgiven? How-do-you-do, Eunice? Have you enjoyed your holiday in the country?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you</b> so late. I am {{the pilot}} of a vessel now in the bay, and have been sent by the captain to carry an {{important}} message to a gentleman who landed with another and two ladies and some armed men. He did not give me sufficient directions to find him, and I thought that if they passed along here {{you might be able}} to put me in the way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear man," [...] said he, [...] "a {{thousand}} apologies <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you,</b> but I'm in {{the most}} awkward position. And there's {{a son of a}} ramrod there that I should know the looks of, and more betoken I believe that he knows mine. Being in this family, sir, and in a place of some responsibility (which was the cause I took the liberty to send for you), you are doubtless of the honest party?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] said he, [...] "I {{wanted to}} ask you a {{question}} on business, if you could spare me one moment's leisure. I know I must apologize <b>for</b> so <b>disturbing</b> <b>you,</b> but in truth I will not detain you five minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The chemist is {{advancing}} rapidly {{with his}} part of the work" [...] (Benjamin wrote); [...] "and I have succeeded in putting together a separate portion of the torn writing which makes sense. Comparison of what he has accomplished with what I have accomplished has led to startling conclusions. Unless Mr. Playmore and I are entirely wrong (and God grant we may be so!), there is a serious necessity for your keeping the reconstruction of the letter strictly secret from everybody about you. The disclosures suggested by what has come to light are so heartrending and so dreadful that I cannot bring myself to write about them until I am absolutely obliged to do so. Please forgive me <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you</b> with this news. We are bound, sooner or later, to consult with you in the matter; and we think it right to prepare your mind for what may be to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you, Tom, you rogue, is {{this the}} way you spend your mornings? I {{expected}} to find you deep in your books. I told your landlady that I hardly liked to come up <b>for</b> fear of <b>disturbing</b> <b>you</b> at your work. You go up for your first professional in a few weeks, I understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{they were}} going into the house together, Leo said: [...] "I think we would better not let our elders read this book of Morselli's. It's too <b>disturbing</b> <b>for</b> them--don't <b>you</b> think so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DEAR LADY VANDRIFT--Will you kindly excuse our {{having gone}} off hurriedly without bidding you good-bye? We have {{just had a}} horrid {{telegram}} to say that Dick's favourite sister is dangerously ill of fever in Paris. I wanted {{to shake hands with}} you before we left--you have all been so sweet to us--but we go by the morning train, absurdly early, and I wouldn't <b>for</b> worlds <b>disturb</b> <b>you.</b> Perhaps some day we may meet again--though, buried as we are in a North-country village, it isn't likely; but in any case, you have secured the grateful recollection of Yours very cordially, JESSIE BRABAZON.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks, my lord, I {{could have}} hoped for no more. Forgive me <b>for</b> having thus <b>disturbed</b> <b>you</b> but, as {{all in the}} house save {{ourselves}} are asleep, I {{thought that it was}} an opportunity that would not occur again. I will teach my son that the English are his friends and, should aught happen to me, and should he ever become rajah here, he will act as their friend, also." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'This time,' said he, 'you are in error. I {{have not}} come to sell, but to buy. I have no curios to dispose of; my uncle's cabinet is bare to the wainscot; even were it still intact, I have done well on the Stock Exchange, and should more likely add to it than otherwise, and my errand to-day is {{simplicity}} itself. I seek a Christmas present for a lady,' he continued, waxing more fluent as he struck into the speech he had prepared; 'and certainly I owe you every excuse <b>for</b> thus <b>disturbing</b> <b>you</b> upon so small a matter. But the thing was neglected yesterday; I must produce my little compliment at dinner; and, as you very well know, a rich marriage is not a thing to be neglected.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Walking rapidly, {{she came}} out at length upon the wide green lawn which lay before the ancient hall where Sir John Coventry lived in solitary splendor. A stately old place, rich in oaks, well-kept shrubberies, gay gardens, sunny terraces, carved gables, spacious rooms, liveried servants, and every luxury {{befitting}} the ancestral home of a rich and honorable race. Miss Muir's eyes brightened as she looked, her step grew firmer, her carriage prouder, and a smile broke over her face; the smile of one well pleased {{at the prospect of}} the success of some cherished hope. Suddenly her whole air changed, she pushed back her hat, clasped her hands loosely before her, and seemed absorbed in girlish admiration of the fair scene that could not fail to charm any beauty-loving eye. The cause of this rapid change soon appeared. A hale, handsome man, between fifty and sixty, came through the little gate leading to the park, and, seeing the young stranger, paused to examine her. He had only time for a glance, however; she seemed conscious of his presence in a moment, turned with a startled look, uttered an exclamation of surprise, and looked as if hesitating whether to speak or run away. Gallant Sir John took off his hat and said, with the old-fashioned courtesy which became him well, [...] "I beg your pardon <b>for</b> <b>disturbing</b> <b>you,</b> young lady. Allow me to atone for it by inviting you to walk where you will, and gather what flowers you like. I see you love them, so pray make free with those about you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys very {{generally}} have {{a habit of}} trying to find people with their tongues, that is, by calling them; {{but it is a}} very bad habit. You see," [...] she continued, [...] "there are five or six persons now in and about the house, and if you go around calling out <b>for</b> Jonas, <b>you</b> <b>disturb</b> us all; but if you go about quietly, and look for him, <b>you</b> do not <b>disturb</b> any body." ...|$|R
50|$|The French police, and Inspector Webster {{from the}} Met, both {{investigate}} {{the case on}} behalf of Murchison's wife, making trips to Belle Ombre and inspecting the house and grounds. Things are further complicated for Ripley as Héloïse returns from a Greek holiday and discovers a man hanging in the cellar. It turns out to just be stuffed clothing, a prop left by Bernard as a suicide in effigy. Bernard leaves a note suggesting {{that he is going}} to confess his forgeries. When Bernard returns to Belle Ombre, Héloïse leaves in disgust. Driven over the edge by guilt, Bernard unsuccessfully tries to strangle Ripley, whom he blames for starting the forgery scheme; Ripley feels <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> the <b>disturbed</b> man and does not retaliate. Later, however, Bernard again tries to kill Ripley, this time knocking him out with a shovel and burying him alive in Murchison's empty grave. Ripley manages to escape and returns to London to impersonate Derwatt for a second appearance, this time for Mrs. Murchison and Inspector Webster. Mrs. Murchison decides to pay a visit to Belle Ombre, the last place her husband was seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{quite so}} safe perhaps, Mr. Ducaine, as you fondly imagined," [...] she remarked. [...] "I {{am afraid that}} we <b>disturbed</b> <b>you.</b> You look awfully busy." ...|$|R
