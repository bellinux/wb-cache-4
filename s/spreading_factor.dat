40|$|Abstract Growing {{self-organizing}} map (GSOM) {{has been introduced}} as an improvement to the {{self-organizing map}} (SOM) algorithm in clustering and knowledge dis-covery. Unlike the traditional SOM, GSOM has a dynamic structure which allows nodes to grow reflecting the knowledge discovered from the input data as learning progresses. The <b>spread</b> <b>factor</b> parameter (SF) in GSOM can be utilized to control {{the spread of the}} map, thus giving an analyst a flexibility to examine the clusters at different granularities. Although GSOM has been applied in various areas and has been proven effective in knowledge discov-ery tasks, no comprehensive study has been done on the effect of the <b>spread</b> <b>factor</b> parameter value to the cluster formation and separation. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the effect of the <b>spread</b> <b>factor</b> value towards cluster separation in the GSOM. We used simple k-means algorithm as a method to identify clusters in the GSOM. By using Davies–Bouldin index, clusters formed by different values of <b>spread</b> <b>factor</b> are obtained and the resulting clusters are analyzed. In this work, we show that clusters can be more separated when the <b>spread</b> <b>factor</b> value is increased.

40|$|An {{interleaver}} is {{a critical}} component for the channel coding performance of turbo codes. Algebraic constructions are important because they admit analytical designs and simple, practical hardware implementation. The <b>spread</b> <b>factor</b> of an interleaver is a common measure for turbo coding applications. Maximum-spread interleavers are interleavers whose <b>spread</b> <b>factors</b> achieve the upper bound. An infinite sequence of quadratic permutation polynomials over integer rings that generate maximum-spread interleavers is presented. New properties of permutation polynomial interleavers are investigated from an algebraic-geometric perspective resulting in a new non-linearity metric for interleavers. A new interleaver metric that {{is a function of}} both the non-linearity metric and the <b>spread</b> <b>factor</b> is proposed. It is numerically demonstrated that the <b>spread</b> <b>factor</b> has a diminishing importance with the block length. A table of good interleavers for a variety of interleaver lengths according to the new metric is listed.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{consider}} stationary time- and frequency-selective channels. No channel knowledge neither at the transmitter nor at the receiver {{is assumed to}} be available. We investigate the capacity behavior of these doubly selective channels {{as a function of the}} channel parameters delay spread, Doppler bandwidth and channel <b>spread</b> <b>factor</b> (the product of the delay spread and the Doppler bandwidth). We shed light on different capacity regimes at high values of signal to noise ratio (SNR) in which the dominant capacity term is either of order log(SNR) or log(log(SNR)), depending on the channel conditions (delay spread, Doppler Bandwidth and channel <b>spread</b> <b>factor).</b> For critically <b>spread</b> channels (channel <b>spread</b> <b>factor</b> of 1), it is widely believed that the dominant term of the high-SNR expansion of the capacity is of order log(log(SNR)) or in other words, that the pre-log (the coefficient of log(SNR)) is zero. We provide a very simple scheme that shows that even for critically spread channels a non-zero pre-log might exist under certain conditions. We also specify these conditions in terms of Doppler bandwidth and delay spread. We also show that a non-zero pre-log might exist even for over-spread channels (channel <b>spread</b> <b>factor</b> greater than 1). We specify the channel conditions which govern the range of existence of the log(SNR) regime. At higher channel <b>spread</b> <b>factor,</b> the log(SNR) term vanishes and a log(log(SNR)) term becomes the dominant capacity term. We specify the range of this log(log(SNR)) regime and also provide bounds for the coefficient of this log(log(SNR)) term (the pre-loglog). I...|$|R

In this paper, the GSOM algorithm is presented in detail {{and the effect of}} a <b>spread</b> <b>factor,</b> which can be used to measure and control the spread of the GSOM, is investigated. The <b>spread</b> <b>factor</b> is independent of the dimensionality of the data and as such {{can be used as a}} controlling measure for generating maps with different dimensionality, which can then be compared and analyzed with better accuracy. The <b>spread</b> <b>factor</b> is also presented as a method of achieving hierarchical clustering of a data set with the GSOM. Such hierarchical clustering allows the data analyst to identify significant and interesting clusters at a higher level of the hierarchy, and as such continue with finer clustering of only the interesting clusters. Therefore, only a small map is created in the beginning with a low <b>spread</b> <b>factor,</b> which can be generated for even a very large data set. Further analysis is conducted on selected sections of the data and as such of smaller volume. Therefore, this method facilitates the analysis of even very large data sets.

50|$|Code {{division}} multiplexing (CDM), Code division {{multiple access}} (CDMA) or spread spectrum is a class of techniques where several channels simultaneously share the same frequency spectrum, and this spectral bandwidth {{is much higher than}} the bit rate or symbol rate. One form is frequency hopping, another is direct sequence spread spectrum. In the latter case, each channel transmits its bits as a coded channel-specific sequence of pulses called chips. Number of chips per bit, or chips per symbol, is the <b>spreading</b> <b>factor.</b> This coded transmission typically is accomplished by transmitting a unique time-dependent series of short pulses, which are placed within chip times within the larger bit time. All channels, each with a different code, can be transmitted on the same fiber or radio channel or other medium, and asynchronously demultiplexed. Advantages over conventional techniques are that variable bandwidth is possible (just as in statistical multiplexing), that the wide bandwidth allows poor signal-to-noise ratio according to Shannon-Hartley theorem, and that multi-path propagation in wireless communication can be combated by rake receivers.|$|E

In the context of the recently established family of adaptive rate-transmission schemes, the transmission rate is typically adapted in response to the channel’s fading-induced quality fluctuation. By contrast, in this contribution the transmission rate is adapted in response to the multiuser interference fluctuations encountered. We present the philosophy of the proposed adaptive rate-transmission scheme and analyze the effective throughput as well as the achievable bit error rate (BER) performance, when communicating over additive white Gaussian noise channels. Our study shows that by employing the proposed VSF-assisted adaptive rate-transmission scheme, the effective throughput may be increased by up to 40 %, when compared to that of DS-CDMA systems using constant <b>spreading</b> <b>factors.</b> This increased throughput is achieved without wasting power, without imposing extra interference upon other users, and without increasing the BER.
