5|$|Sexuality is an {{important}} part of each person's identity, although some people might have no interest in sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, <b>sex</b> <b>drive,</b> reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender expression. Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as religious and cultural background play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).|$|E
5|$|Morales {{and other}} {{officers}} meet with psychiatrist Dr. Kress at a restaurant, where {{he explains that}} the Phantom is a highly intelligent sadist with a strong <b>sex</b> <b>drive,</b> {{between the ages of}} 35 and 40. As Kress expresses his doubts about their chances of capturing the Phantom, the Phantom's shoes are shown, revealing that he had heard the entire conversation. At the station, a man named Johnson says that he was robbed and forced to drive a man to Lufkin at gunpoint. While on the road, Ramsey receives a report about an armed suspect, and a brief chase ensues. The suspect, Eddie LeDoux, at first denies everything, then confesses to being the Phantom, but Morales is unconvinced. Johnson identifies him as his robber.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that, {{for most}} women, high <b>sex</b> <b>drive</b> {{is associated with}} increased sexual attraction to both women and men. For men, however, high <b>sex</b> <b>drive</b> is associated with increased attraction to one sex or the other, but not to both, depending on sexual orientation. Similarly for most bisexual women, high <b>sex</b> <b>drive</b> is associated with increased sexual attraction to both women and men; while for bisexual men, high <b>sex</b> <b>drive</b> is associated with increased attraction to one sex, and weakened attraction to the other.|$|E
5|$|The Land of Gorch {{segments}} {{deal with}} adult themes; characters use euphemisms {{to refer to}} their <b>sex</b> <b>drives</b> and often consume alcohol. They often contradict each other and act obnoxiously and lasciviously. They grapple with adult issues including death, sexual intercourse, and alcoholism.|$|R
50|$|In Meiners large work {{entitled}} Researches on {{the variations}} in human nature (1815), he studied the sexology of each race and claimed that the African Negroids have unduly strong and perverted <b>sex</b> <b>drives</b> whilst only the White Europeans have it just right.|$|R
50|$|In Meiners's large work {{entitled}} Researches on the Variations in Human Nature (1815), {{he studied}} also the sexology of each race. He {{claimed that the}} African Negroids have unduly strong and perverted <b>sex</b> <b>drives,</b> whilst only the white Europeans have it just right.|$|R
25|$|Estrogens are {{involved}} in <b>sex</b> <b>drive</b> in both women and men.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sex</b> <b>drive</b> is {{dependent}} on androgen levels only {{in the presence of}} estrogen, but without estrogen, free testosterone level actually decreases sexual desire (instead of increases <b>sex</b> <b>drive),</b> as demonstrated for those women who have hypoactive sexual desire disorder, and the sexual desire in these women can be restored by administration of estrogen (using oral contraceptive). In non-human mammals, mating desire is triggered by estrogen surge in estrus.|$|E
25|$|Human sexual {{activity}} has sociological, cognitive, emotional, behavioural and biological aspects; these include personal bonding, sharing emotions and the physiology of the reproductive system, <b>sex</b> <b>drive,</b> sexual intercourse and sexual behaviour {{in all its}} forms.|$|E
50|$|The film {{introduces}} Bob Radke and Ed Chambers, two pedophilic men who openly {{acknowledge that}} they experience sexual attractions to children, but have never touched or molested one. They live their lives suppressing their <b>sex</b> <b>drives,</b> but still face being stigmatized and marginalized.|$|R
5000|$|Among Weinrich's {{contributions}} are the [...] "Pink and Blue Sex Theory" [...] developed with Richard Pillard, {{which holds that}} {{there are two kinds of}} <b>sex</b> <b>drives</b> and both exist in men and women. He and Pillard also found that homosexuality runs in some families.|$|R
5000|$|In medicine, hyperspermia is a {{condition}} in which a male has an abnormally large ejaculate (or semen) volume. [...] Males with hyperspermia usually have higher <b>sex</b> <b>drives</b> than males that do not. It is the opposite of hypospermia, and is generally defined in humans when the ejaculate is over 5.5 ml.|$|R
25|$|The {{aggressive}} drive – {{known as}} mortido – may be displaced {{quite as much}} as the libidinal - the <b>sex</b> <b>drive.</b> Business or athletic competition, or hunting, for instance, offer plentiful opportunities for the expression of displaced mortido.|$|E
25|$|Considering {{sexuality}} {{an important}} {{driving force in}} human life {{that should not be}} excluded from the narrative, Martin equipped many of the Ice and Fire characters with a <b>sex</b> <b>drive.</b> Martin was also fascinated by medieval contrasts where knights venerated their ladies with poems and wore their favors in tournaments while their armies raped women in wartime.|$|E
25|$|The {{psychological}} {{changes are}} harder to define, since HRT is usually the first physical action that takes place when transitioning. This fact alone has a significant psychological impact, which is hard to distinguish from hormonally induced changes. Most trans men report an increase of energy and an increased <b>sex</b> <b>drive.</b> Many also report feeling more confident.|$|E
50|$|The novel narrates {{the story}} of Peruvian Army Captain Pantaleón Pantoja, whose {{superiors}} involve him, despite his reluctance, in a mission to satisfy the <b>sex</b> <b>drives</b> of soldiers stationed in the Peruvian department of Amazons. Pantoja is chosen {{to carry out the}} mission by virtue of being a model soldier, free from vices and without children of his own.|$|R
50|$|The female erotic {{plasticity}} hypothesis {{states that}} women have higher erotic plasticity than men, and therefore their <b>sex</b> <b>drives</b> are more socially flexible and responsive than those of men (factors such as religion, culture and education have a greater effect on women’s sexual behaviors). Men, on the other hand, remain relatively rigid after puberty but can still be affected by these factors.|$|R
50|$|Openness {{is related}} to many aspects of sexuality. Men and women high in {{openness}} are more well-informed about sex, have wider sexual experience, stronger <b>sex</b> <b>drives,</b> and more liberal sexual attitudes. In married couples, wives' but not husbands' level of openness {{is related to}} sexual satisfaction. This might be because open wives {{are more willing to}} explore a variety of new sexual experiences, leading to greater satisfaction for both spouses.|$|R
25|$|Progestogens {{reportedly}} alter fat distribution (e.g., {{by increasing}} {{fat in the}} buttocks and thighs), increase <b>sex</b> <b>drive</b> (specifically progesterone, via its active metabolite allopregnanolone; this does not occur through activation of the progesterone receptor), cause increased appetite and weight gain (only in combination with estrogen), produce a sense of calm (i.e., anxiolysis), and promote sleep (i.e., sedative and hypnotic effects).|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of puberty, {{androgen}} levels increase dramatically in males, and androgens mediate the development of masculine secondary sexual characteristics {{as well as the}} activation of spermatogenesis and fertility and masculine behavioral changes such as gynephilia and increased <b>sex</b> <b>drive.</b> Masculine secondary sexual characteristics include androgenic hair, voice deepening, emergence of the Adam's apple, broadening of the shoulders, increased muscle mass, and penile growth.|$|E
25|$|Spaying (females only) and neutering (both genders {{but more}} {{commonly}} males) {{refers to the}} sterilization of animals, usually by removal of the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, in order to eliminate the ability to procreate, and reduce <b>sex</b> <b>drive.</b> Neutering has also been known to reduce aggression in male dogs, but {{has been shown to}} occasionally increase aggression in female dogs.|$|E
5000|$|Metalious was {{promoted}} by her publisher {{in a photo}} captioned [...] "Pandora in Blue Jeans". Commenting on her critics, she observed, [...] "If I'm a lousy writer, then {{an awful lot of}} people have lousy taste," [...] and as to the frankness of her work, she stated, [...] "Even Tom Sawyer had a girlfriend, and to talk about adults without talking about their <b>sex</b> <b>drives</b> is like talking about a window without glass." ...|$|R
50|$|Children {{are legally}} {{permitted}} to have <b>sex</b> or <b>drive</b> {{a car in}} some countries, which are more dangerous and difficult than voting.|$|R
50|$|Blair and Jeff were {{introduced}} to each other at a mutual friend's pool party. After almost a year of dating, the couple entered a domestic partnership in Savannah, Georgia. Jeff and Blair visit a sex therapist to address a large gap in their <b>sex</b> <b>drives</b> and other issues associated with their 16-year age difference, contrasting careers, and minor personality clashes. Blair is a former European pop star and current entertainment reporter, while Jeff works as a federal investigator.|$|R
25|$|Some {{analysts have}} posited {{that a high}} libido may {{be a factor in}} polygyny, {{although}} others have downplayed its significance. The <b>sex</b> <b>drive</b> as a factor in some Asian cultures was sometimes associated with wealthy men and those that were adjunct to an aristocracy, although such libidinal perceptions were at times discarded in favor of seeing polygyny as a factor of traditional life. Other explanations postulate that polygyny is a tool used to ward off inclinations towards infidelity.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacological {{interventions}} {{are used to}} lower the <b>sex</b> <b>drive</b> in general, which can ease the management of pedophilic feelings, but does not change sexual preference. Antiandrogens work by interfering with the activity of testosterone. Cyproterone acetate (Androcur) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) are the most commonly used. The efficacy of antiantrogens has some support, but few high-quality studies exist. Cyproterone acetate has the strongest evidence for reducing sexual arousal, while findings on medroxyprogesterone acetate have been mixed.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{methyltestosterone}} include androgenic side effects like oily skin, acne, seborrhea, increased facial/body hair growth, scalp hair loss, increased aggressiveness and <b>sex</b> <b>drive,</b> and spontaneous erections, {{as well as}} estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia, fluid retention, and edema. In women, methyltestosterone can cause partially irreversible virilization, for instance voice deepening, hirsutism, clitoromegaly, breast atrophy, and muscle hypertrophy, as well as menstrual disturbances and reversible infertility. In men, the drug may also cause hypogonadism, testicular atrophy, and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages.|$|E
50|$|In Namibia, HIV {{is mainly}} spread through {{heterosexual}} <b>sex,</b> <b>driven</b> by {{high rates of}} multiple and concurrent partnerships, transactional sex and child abuse, misconceptions {{in the general population}} about the risk of contracting HIV, low and inconsistent condom use, high rates of alcohol abuse, a high rate of mobility and migration, and a decline in marital and cohabiting unions. Of greatest concern to many are the AIDS orphans and vulnerable children left behind in the trails of this disease.|$|R
50|$|She {{played a}} vampire in the 2010 film I Am Virgin {{which was about}} a virus infecting the earth and turning people into <b>sex</b> <b>driven</b> vampires. The {{following}} year she appeared in another film of the horror genre called Stripperland which was {{about a group of}} people banding together to survive in a post-apocalyptic land over run by zombies. She played one of the two uninfected women. Two years later she was in another horror film, Blood Creek Woodsman.|$|R
5000|$|A {{reviewer}} at Huffington Post {{praised the}} song particularly its lyrical content, stating that {{this song is}} [...] "her take on modern day love, in her unique style, the track is aconcoction of heart filled and sensual yet <b>sex</b> <b>driven,</b> drug fuelled and passionate."David Jeffries of AllMusic praised Aiko's [...] "twist" [...] {{on the work of}} Lennon calling it a [...] "cheeky twist" [...] and praised the song for being [...] "light-stepping," [...] Jeffries continued to praise the inclusion of rapper Gambino.|$|R
25|$|Common {{side effects}} of {{citalopram}} include drowsiness, insomnia, nausea, weight changes (usually weight gain), increase in appetite, vivid dreaming, frequent urination, decreased <b>sex</b> <b>drive,</b> anorgasmia, dry mouth, increased sweating, trembling, diarrhea, excessive yawning, severe tinnitus, and fatigue. Less common side effects include bruxism, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, blood pressure changes, dilated pupils, anxiety, mood swings, headache, and dizziness. Rare side effects include convulsions, hallucinations, severe allergic reactions and photosensitivity. If sedation occurs, the dose may be taken at bedtime {{rather than in the}} morning. Some data suggest citalopram may cause nightmares.|$|E
25|$|During copulation, sperm is {{transferred}} from male to female inside a spermatophore. There are several theories regarding the adaptive value of using a spermatophore. It contains certain chemicals that may inhibit the female’s <b>sex</b> <b>drive.</b> Alternatively, it may physically plug the female’s gonophore. In either explanation, the spermatophore prevents the female from reproducing with another male. In essence, {{the use of a}} spermatophore is evolutionarily favorable because it increases the probability of the male’s genetic code being transferred to subsequent generations by lessening potential competition from other males.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} to be metabolized by 5α-reductase and the AR activity of the resultant metabolites appears {{to be one of}} the major, if not the most important determinant of the androgenic-myotrophic ratio for a given AAS. AAS that are not potentiated by 5α-reductase or that are weakened by 5α-reductase in androgenic tissues have a reduced risk of androgenic side effects such as acne, androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness), hirsutism (excessive male-pattern hair growth), benign prostatic hyperplasia (prostate enlargement), and prostate cancer, while incidence and magnitude of other effects such as muscle hypertrophy, bone changes, voice deepening, and changes in <b>sex</b> <b>drive</b> show no difference.|$|E
50|$|Genital-genital rubbing {{has been}} {{observed}} between males of other animals as well. The homosexual activities of bonobos are of special interest because of their genetic closeness to humans; and like humans, their <b>sex</b> <b>drives</b> are not reproductively-driven. Among bonobos, frottage frequently occurs when two males hang from a tree limb and engage in penis fencing; it also occurs while two males are in missionary position. There is also a special form of frottage called rump rubbing in which males stand back to back on all fours and rub their genito-anal regions together.|$|R
25|$|Another basic {{drive is}} the sexual drive which like food motivates us {{because it is}} {{essential}} to our survival. The desire for sex is wired deep into the brain of all human beings as glands secrete hormones that travel through the blood to the brain and stimulates the onset of sexual desire. The hormone involved in the initial onset of sexual desire is called Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The hormonal basis of both men and women's <b>sex</b> <b>drives</b> is testosterone. Men naturally have more testosterone than women do and so are more likely than woman to think about sex.|$|R
50|$|An antigonadotropin {{is a drug}} which {{suppresses}} {{the activity}} and/or downstream effects of {{one or both of}} the gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This results in an inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, and thus a decrease in the levels of the androgen, estrogen, and progestogen sex steroids in the body. Antigonadotropins are used for a variety of purposes, including for the treatment hormonally-sensitive cancers, to delay precocious puberty and puberty in transgender youth, as a form of chemical castration to reduce the <b>sex</b> <b>drives</b> of individuals with hypersexuality or pedophilia, and to treat estrogen-associated conditions in women such as menorrhagia and endometriosis.|$|R
