5|$|From January 1916, all patrolling {{east of the}} Suez Canal {{was left}} to the British yeomanry and the Australian Light Horse formations. The Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade {{concentrated}} on patrolling the <b>Sweet</b> <b>Water</b> Canal, the railway line between Suez and Port Said, and the Suez Canal Zone {{to the west of}} the canal, which was a restricted area for non-military personnel. On 31 March, Major-General W.A. Watson assumed command of the Nile Delta region and was replaced as brigade commander by Brigadier-General M.H. Henderson. In May 1916, the brigade was reduced to two cavalry regiments when the Patiala Lancers left for Mesopotamia. The brigade also carried out weapons and signal training, but the year ended without them being involved in any contact with the Turkish.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Sir Archibald Murray, the Imperial Commander in Chief of Egypt, {{partially}} {{addressed the}} threat of von Kressenstein's forces to the Suez Canal by organising the defences into three sectors. No. 1 (Southern) sector, with its headquarters at Suez, covered the area from Suez to Kabrit, No. 2 (Central) sector, with its headquarters at Ismailia, covered the area from Kabrit to Ferdan, and No. 3 (Northern) sector, with its headquarters at Port Said, covered the area from Ferdan to Port Said. The No. 3 sector also had an advanced headquarters at Kantara. To support these forward defences, the British Empire improved their lines of communication by doubling the single railway line that ran from Cairo to the Suez Canal, and also pumped water from the River Nile along the <b>Sweet</b> <b>Water</b> Canal to supply the troops and the towns on the Suez Canal.|$|E
5|$|While {{waiting at}} Deolali {{to embark for}} Egypt, the brigade {{conducted}} regimental and brigade training programmes during which all ranks and animals were inspected, and those found unfit for service were returned to their regimental depots. Between 27 and 29 October the brigade moved to Bombay for embarkation; six transport ships carrying most of the brigade sailed on 1 November, while a seventh ship carrying two squadrons of Mysore Lancers remained behind with mechanical problems and finally set sail a fortnight later. The {{main body of the}} brigade arrived at Suez on 16 November, travelled by train to Ismailia two days later and started their first war-time patrols {{along the banks of the}} <b>Sweet</b> <b>Water</b> Canal. The brigade was not assigned to a higher formation at this time but were Army Troops under command of General Headquarters. The Bikaner Camel Corps, another Imperial Service unit, was attached to the brigade at Ismailia for administrative purposes, but was not operationally attached. To expand the area the brigade could patrol, squadrons were detached to El Kubri, Kantarah and the Ferry Post crossing at Ismailia. At the same time, the brigade became responsible for patrolling the length of the Suez Canal. The other British forces defending the canal were more static infantry formations, comprising the 42nd (East Lancashire), and the 10th and 11th Indian Divisions, the latter included the Imperial Service Infantry Brigade as one of its three brigades. Their Turkish opponents had around 25,000 men in the region, including the 25th Division.|$|E

This burnt lime is then slaked in <b>sweet</b> <b>water</b> to produce a calcium hydroxide suspension for the precipitation of impurities in raw juice during carbonatation.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{the canal}} was preceded by cutting a small fresh-water canal called <b>Sweet</b> <b>Water</b> Canal from the Nile delta along Wadi Tumilat to the future canal, with a {{southern}} branch to Suez and a northern branch to Port Said. Completed in 1863, these brought fresh water to a previously arid area, initially for canal construction, and subsequently facilitating growth of agriculture and settlements along the canal.|$|E
25|$|At the {{southern}} end of the maidan stands a well built by Bhika Behram in 1725. Behram, a Parsi, was travelling through this region, when he built this well for travellers. The well has a perennial source of <b>sweet</b> <b>water,</b> which is remarkable as most of the water in the area is brackish owing to the proximity to the Arabian Sea. The site is a declared heritage structure and is held sacred by the Parsi community.|$|E

25|$|Achelous was {{considered}} to be an important divinity throughout Greece from the earliest times, and was invoked in prayers, sacrifices, on taking oaths, etc.; the oracular Zeus at Dodona usually added to each oracle he gave, the command to offer sacrifices to Achelous. The widespread worship of Achelous points to a more generic meaning of the god himself, perhaps accounting for an interpretation of Achelous as the representative of <b>sweet</b> <b>water</b> in general, and consequently, as the source of all nourishment.|$|E
25|$|Water {{scarcity}} {{plays an}} important role in shaping life in all parts of Thar. Natural (tobas) or man-made (johads), both types of small, intermittent ponds, are often the only source of water for animals and humans in the true desert areas. The lack of a constant water supply causes much of the local population to live as nomads. Most human settlements are found near the two seasonal streams of the Karon-Jhar hills. Potable groundwater is also rare in the Thar desert. Supplies are often sour due to dissolved minerals, and are only available deep underground. Wells that successfully bear <b>sweet</b> <b>water</b> attract nearby settlement, but are difficult to dig, possibly claiming the lives of the well-diggers.|$|E
25|$|Trying {{to prevent}} another Turkish {{attack against the}} Suez Canal, Murray reorganized his troops and led a counterattack, winning a victory at Romani in August 1916. He now had to advance over the Sinai Peninsula, which {{consisted}} of sand in the north, gravel and clay in the centre and mountains in the south. 400 miles of railway, 300 miles of metalled and wire-meshed roads and 300 miles of pipes had to be laid. Drinking water had to be pumped underneath the Suez Canal from the <b>Sweet</b> <b>Water</b> Canal in the Nile Delta, requiring the construction of filtration plants, reservoirs and pumping stations. The line on the frontier was 45 miles in width, half {{the width of the}} 80–90 mile front on the Canal. Murray captured El Arish in December and Rafa on the Palestine frontier in January 1917.|$|E

25|$|By 5 February {{the water}} {{pipeline}} from the Egyptian <b>Sweet</b> <b>Water</b> Canal, which carried {{water from the}} Nile, had reached El Arish, while the railway line was being laid well {{to the east of}} that place. The creation of this infrastructure enabled a strong defensive position and a forward base to be established at El Arish. There were now two possible directions for an advance towards Jerusalem by Eastern Force to take: through Rafa on the coast, or inland through Hafir El Auja, on the Ottoman railway. Lieutenant General Charles Macpherson Dobell, commanding Eastern Force, thought that an advance along the coast could force the Ottoman Army to withdraw their inland forces, as they became outflanked and subject to attack by the EEF from the rear. He proposed keeping two divisions at El Arish, moving his headquarters there, while his mounted division would advance to reoccupy Rafa (captured by the Desert Column on 9 January during the Battle of Rafa).|$|E
25|$|The caged rats (Groups CC and PC) {{took to the}} {{morphine}} instantly, {{even with}} relatively little sweetener, with the caged males drinking 19 times more morphine than the Rat Park males {{in one of the}} experimental conditions. The rats in Rat Park resisted the morphine water. They would try it occasionallywith the females trying it more often than the malesbut they showed a statistically significant preference for the plain water. He writes that the most interesting group was Group CP, the rats who were brought up in cages but moved to Rat Park before the experiment began. These animals rejected the morphine solution when it was stronger, but as it became sweeter and more dilute, they began to drink almost as much as the rats that had lived in cages throughout the experiment. They wanted the <b>sweet</b> <b>water,</b> he concluded, so long as it did not disrupt their normal social behavior. Even more significant, he writes, was that when he added a drug called Naloxone, which negates the effects of opioids, to the morphine-laced water, the Rat Park rats began to drink it.|$|E
25|$|Downstream of the Aswan Dam, {{there are}} seven barrages to {{increase}} the river's water level {{so that it can}} flow into first-level irrigation canals. One of them is the 350km long Ibrahimiya Canal completed in 1873, the largest artificial canal in the world. It branches off the left bank of the Nile in Assiut and then runs parallel to the river. Its discharge was increased by the Assiut Barrage completed in 1903. Other large barrages exist at Esna and Naga Hammadi on the main Nile, as well as the Delta Barrage, the Zifta Barrage and the Damietta Barrage on the Damietta branch and the Edfina barrage on the Rosetta branch of the Nile. Water also flows from the Nile to the Faiyum Oasis through a canal called Bahr Yussef that dates back to Pharaonic times. From the oasis it flows to the Birket Qarun (Lake Moesis). The Fresh Water Canal runs from Cairo to Ismailia and the <b>Sweet</b> <b>Water</b> Canal runs in parallel to the Suez Canal, supplying drinking water to the cities along the Canal. Both canals were completed in 1863. The Mahmoudiyah Canal links the Nile to Alexandria. Completed in 1820 it used to have an important role for navigation, but nowadays is used primarily for irrigation and to supply Alexandria with drinking water.|$|E

25|$|A {{couple years}} before dying {{he was often}} heard {{remarking}} that he had grown old and this {{to some of his}} devotees was him dropping hints about his final days being imminently close. On the morning of 28 May 1968, as a part of his daily routine, he washed his face, tied his turban and smeared his forehead with a saffron mark (called tilak in Hinduism). All throughout the day, many people had come to visit him. Later-on in the noon, some sadhus (wandering monks) too had come to visit him. He used to give alms to these visiting sadhus (some of whom he would call as mere jugglers in ochre robes) who, on their journey to Amarnath shrine, would stop-over at his place. On this day too, he gave these sadhus whatever money he had in his cloth purse. He is then said to have gone into a state of meditative trance (called samadhi in Hinduism) till about 5:30pm when he asked for some water and was helped to drink a tumbler full of <b>sweet</b> <b>water.</b> He died at about 5:45pm and his recorded last words were Om Namah Shivaya (the mantra of Lord Shiva). On his death, Swami Nand Lal, is said to have remarked that Kashmir was being rocked by an earthquake. He is also said to have predicted Bhagwan Gopinath's death a week in advance.|$|E

Cane-field fires spread crackling and hissing in the saw grass in vast waves and pillars and billowing mountains of heavy, cream-colored, purple-shadowed smoke.
