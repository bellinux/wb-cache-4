50|$|The <b>super-high</b> <b>frequency</b> (<b>SHF)</b> and {{extremely}} high frequency (EHF) of microwaves are on the short side of radio waves. Microwaves are waves that are typically short enough (measured in millimeters) to employ tubular metal waveguides of reasonable diameter. Microwave energy is produced with klystron and magnetron tubes, and with solid state diodes such as Gunn and IMPATT devices. Microwaves are absorbed by molecules that have a dipole moment in liquids. In a microwave oven, this effect is used to heat food. Low-intensity microwave radiation is used in Wi-Fi, although this is at intensity levels unable to cause thermal heating.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{decreasing}} {{the strength of}} frost rocks (FRs) under <b>super-high</b> <b>frequency</b> (<b>SHF)</b> heating has been investigated. A physical model of behaviour of the FRs subjected to SHF and mechanical action has been built. The laws determining the reduction in strength and increase in capability for compacting under SHF adiabatic heating have been established. The effect of the SHF field power on the FR mass has been studied. A method optimizing the process of introduction of the SHF power into the rock mass has been developed. The concept of SHF aerodynamic (AD) means of crushing productive disintegrated bulk frost rock formations has been substantiated. The processes of working a gold-containing stratum by using the SHF-AD method, {{as well as that}} of cleaning the productive FRs layer on the working out floor by means of the cutting-break-off destruction in combination with picking up the rock mass have been investigated.
