5|$|Super Mario 3D Land {{utilizes}} the Nintendo 3DS's autostereoscopic technology, allowing {{players to}} perceive depth when viewing the game screen. While {{the game is}} designed to not require the 3D effect, some obstacles or points of interest are deliberately more noticeable or easier when the 3D is switched on. Super Mario 3D Land also utilizes optional use of the 3DS gyroscope, {{which can be used}} to control cannons and binoculars. The game also features StreetPass functionality, allowing players to exchange Mystery Boxes containing bonus items. StreetPass also gives players another Toad house <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> items.|$|E
25|$|The {{left and}} right board edge are {{controlled}} by the battery formed by Lance and Chariot. Usually little can be achieved here before you somehow acquire a majority by taking {{out some of the}} opponent's pieces there from the side. But even if the opponent's edge would be completely annihilated, it will take an impractically long time before you can cash in on that, and promote Lance and Chariot <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> involved on the real battle, as you would first have to get your Pawn out of the way by walking it to promotion. So a majority here is more a tie breaker in case the main battle ends undecided than an immediate advantage.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the small}} number of Chinese {{surnames}} leads to confusion in social environments, and because some Chinese parents have a desire to give individuality, some Chinese have received unusual given names. As of April 2009, about 60 million Chinese people have unusual characters in their names. A 2006 report by the Chinese public security bureau stated that of about 55,000 Chinese characters used in the People's Republic of China, only 32,232 of those are supported by the ministry's computers. The PRC government has asked individuals with unusual names to change them <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> new computer-readable public identity cards, and the diversity prevents them from receiving new identity cards if they do not change their names.|$|E

500|$|The {{popularity}} of New Year's Rockin' Eve {{also resulted in}} Clark making appearances on other television series to reference his role. During a Y2K-themed short in The Simpsons 1999 Halloween special [...] "Treehouse of Horror X", Clark made a cameo appearance hosting a New Year's Eve event in Springfield. The Y2K bug caused the emcee to melt, exposing him as a robot. In an interview following the episode's airing with its writer, Ron Hauge, Clark said that the episode gave the [...] "biggest response" [...] he had ever gotten from anything he had ever done. Clark made a further appearance during the pilot episode of fellow Matt Groening series Futurama, [...] "Space Pilot 3000", where Clark's head (as preserved in a jar) hosts an edition of New Year's Rockin' Eve counting down to the year 3000. In the 1994 film Forrest Gump, [...] footage of Clark from {{the first edition of}} New Year's Rockin' Eve is seen on a television at a bar during a scene of the film taking place on New Year's Eve in 1972. New Year's Rockin' Eve was also the subject of an episode of the sitcom Friends, [...] "The One with the Routine", in which Ross and Monica Geller attend a taping of New Year's Rockin' Eve as audience members, trying to draw attention to themselves <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> on-camera.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle. Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a [...] "catapult". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t do any of the stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman who did that [...] They put a rocket for her in the back of the car, and they had that breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, through the windshield, and she rolls on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. Then I have to go in, lay in the same position, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a close-up of my eyes opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the United Kingdom (UK) it {{is thought}} that between 12,000 and 15,000 people have sickle cell disease [...] with an {{estimate}} of 250,000 carriers of the condition in England alone. As the number of carriers is only estimated, all newborn babies in the UK receive a routine blood test to screen for the condition. [...] Due to many adults in high-risk groups not knowing if they are carriers, pregnant women and both partners in a couple are offered screening <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> counselling if they have the sickle cell trait. In addition blood donors from those in high-risk groups are also screened to confirm whether they are carriers and whether their blood filters properly. Donors who are found to be carriers are then informed and their blood, while often used for those of the same ethnic group, is not used for those with sickle cell disease who require a blood transfusion.|$|E

Noah manages to free the hostages, but is then taken hostage himself. Just as Knox and Jesse Murphy (now free of Peter's influence) are about to start beating him up, Sylar enters and stops them both with his telekinesis, also neutralizing Jesse's power. Noah reminds him of the [...] "plan", and Sylar replies [...] "You just said that to make sure I didn't." [...] Soon afterwards, Sylar loses control, locks Noah out of the bank, and kills Jesse for his power, allowing Knox to escape. Back at Level 5, Noah mentions to the Haitian that he only plans to be partnered with Sylar long enough to ascertain a weakness, to which then he'll kill him. When he chastises Sylar for the death of Jesse, he merely states that [...] "rehabilitation doesn't happen overnight." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{proteins}} listed that interact with CCDC130, including EEF1A1, NINL, TRAF2, ZBTB16, ZNF165, and ZNF24. EEF1A1 is a eukaryotic elongation factor that {{is involved in}} the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site of ribosomes during translation. [...] NINL is a ninein-like protein that is involved in microtubule organization and has calcium ion binding activity. TRAF2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 2, is part of some E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes and is involved in ubiquitinating proteins <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> degraded by the proteasome. ZBTB16, zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 16, is also part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and is most likely involved in substrate recognition. There is also an alternate form of CCDC130 where only 803 bases are transcribed instead of 1433 bases, but there is no additional information provided. [...] ZNF165 and ZNF24 are both zinc finger proteins, which bind DNA and other proteins to regulate transcription. Below is a table of the interacting proteins for CCDC130 assembled by GeneCards. The interactions of CCDC130 with NINL, ZNF24, TRAF2, JUP, GATA5 have been verified by a two-hybrid screen according to STRING, so these interactions do occur. JUP is a plaque protein. GATA5 is a transcription factor that helps activate the promoter for lactase-phlorizin hydrolase. Interactions with CDA, DERA, CDC40, NAA25, DGCR14, NAA20, and PRPF19 have not been verified experimentally, but interactions between gene homologs have been documented in other species according to STRING so these interactions could potentially occur. ZBTB16, EEF1A1, and ZNF165 all have been verified by at least one two-hybrid screen according to MINT. NAT9 was described as a known interactant on I2D. In a study done at the University of the District of Columbia to characterize CCDC130, they have found that it is induced through insulin signaling, is targeted by three different kinases (GSK3, CK1, and CK2), and is a mitochondrial protein.5 The study also shows that CCDC130 can potentially be used as a biomarker for certain types of cancer due to its differential expression in cancer cells. The study specifically mentions that CCDC130 is downregulated in some types of colon cancer, which allowed more cancer cells to be untargeted by the apoptosis pathway.|$|E
