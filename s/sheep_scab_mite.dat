Analysis of a P. ovis expressed sequence tag (EST) database identified a number of antioxidant enzyme-encoding sequences, including peroxiredoxin (thioredoxin peroxidase EC 1. 11. 1. 15), all of which may help the mite endure the potentially toxic skin environment. A full length sequence encoding Po-TPx, a protein of 206 amino acids which showed high homology to a peroxiredoxin from the salivary gland of the tick Ixodes scapularis, was amplified from P. ovis cDNA.

40|$|Objectives: Despite {{multiple}} {{attempts at}} eradication, many ectoparasites {{of humans and}} domestic livestock remain a persistent problem in the modern world. For many years, a range of pesticide drugs including organophosphates, organochlorides and synthetic pyrethroids provided effective control of these parasites; but intensive use of these drugs {{has led to the}} evolution of resistance in many target species. This paper aims to review the effectiveness of current control methods and discuss potential alternatives for the long term sustainable control of ectoparasites. Key Findings: Important medical ectoparasites such as scabies mites, head lice and bed bugs present a significant public health problem, and so adequate control methods are essential. Ectoparasites of domestic livestock and farmed fish (for example <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> <b>mites,</b> poultry mites and sea lice) are also of concern given the increasing strain on the world's food supply. These parasites have become resistant to several classes of pesticide, making control very difficult. Recently, an increasing amount of research has focussed on alternative control methods such as insect growth regulators, biological control using essential oils or fungi, as well as vaccine development against some ectoparasites of medical and veterinary importance. Summary: Drug resistance is prevalent in all of the ectoparasites discussed in this review. A wide variety of alternative control methods have been identified, however further research is necessary in order for these to be used to successfully control ectoparasitic diseases in the future...|$|R

A larger proportion of mites was present in the fleece of Dorper sheep distal to the skin in the late afternoon and early morning than at other times during the day. Immature and adult mites readily transferred to tufts of wool or hair placed on infested sheep of both breeds. No mites could be found on wool or hair rubbed off onto tree trunks or branches or other structures in enclosures housing heavily infested sheep, nor could any mites be collected from the soil of these enclosures, whereas more than 80 % of mites artificially seeded onto soil samples were recovered. The longest mean off-host survival times for larvae, nymphs, and male and ovigerous female mites were recorded at 10 ºC, and were 9. 25 days (RH= 90 %), 15 days (RH= 33 % and 75 %), 10. 5 days (RH= 75 % and 90 %) and 11. 25 days (RH= 90 %) respectively. Under natural climatic conditions ovigerous females in glass vials containing Merino wool survived for 17 days compared to 15 days for females in vials without wool; this difference was, however, not significant.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Sheep</b> <b>scab</b> is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} disease of sheep caused by the ectoparasitic mite Psoroptes ovis. The disease is endemic in the UK and has significant economic impact through its effects on performance and welfare. Diagnosis of <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> is achieved through observation of clinical signs e. g. itching, pruritis and wool loss and ultimately through the detection of mites in skin scrapings. Early stages of infestation are often difficult to diagnose and sub-clinical animals can be {{a major factor in}} disease spread. The development of a diagnostic assay would enable farmers and veterinarians to detect disease at an early stage, reducing the risk of developing clinical disease and limiting spread. Methods Serum samples were obtained from an outbreak of <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> within an experimental flock (n = 480 (3 samples each from 160 sheep)) allowing the assessment, by ELISA of <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> specific antibody prior to infestation, mid-outbreak (combined with clinical assessment) and post-treatment. Results Analysis of pre-infestation samples demonstrated low levels of potential false positives (3. 8 %). Of the 27 animals with clinical or behavioural signs of disease 25 tested positive at the mid-outbreak sampling period, however, the remaining 2 sheep tested positive at the subsequent sampling period. Clinical assessment revealed the absence of clinical or behavioural signs of disease in 132 sheep, whilst analysis of mid-outbreak samples showed that 105 of these clinically negative animals were serologically positive, representing potential sub-clinical infestations. Conclusions This study demonstrates that this ELISA test can effectively diagnose <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> in a natural outbreak of disease, and more importantly, highlights its ability to detect sub-clinically infested animals. This ELISA, employing a single recombinant antigen, represents a major step forward in the diagnosis of <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> and may prove to be critical in any future control program. </p...|$|R

40|$|Infestation of ovine {{skin with}} the ectoparasitic mite Psoroptes ovis {{results in the}} {{development}} of a rapid cutaneous inflammatory response, leading to the crusted skin lesions characteristic of <b>sheep</b> <b>scab.</b> To facilitate the identification of novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets, a better understanding of the host-parasite relationship in <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> is essential. Although our knowledge of the host’s local cutaneous inflammatory response to <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> has increased in recent years, we still know relatively little about the mechanisms of this response at the systemic level. This study used a combined network and pathway analysis of the in vivo transcriptomic response of circulating leukocytes to infestation with P. ovis, during a 6 week period. Network graph analysis identified six temporally-associated gene clusters, which separated into two distinct sub-networks within the graph, representing those genes either up or down-regulated during the time course. Functional and pathway analysis of these clusters identified novel insights into the host systemic response to P. ovis infestation, including roles for the complement system, clotting cascade and fibrinolysis. These analyses also highlighted potential mechanisms by which the systemic immune response to <b>sheep</b> <b>scab</b> can influence local tissue responses via enhanced leukocyte activation and extravasation. By analysing the transcriptomic responses of circulating leukocytes in sheep following infestation with P. ovis, this study has provided key insights into the inflammatory response to infestation and has also demonstrated the utility of these cells as a proxy of events occurring at local tissue sites, providing insight int...|$|R

The main objective of this study was to perform a combined network and pathway analysis of the in vivo skin response to infestation with P. ovis to gain a clearer understanding of the mechanisms and signalling pathways involved. Results Infestation with P. ovis resulted in differential expression of 1, 552 genes over a 24 hour time course. Clustering by peak gene expression enabled classification of genes into temporally related groupings. Network and pathway analysis of clusters identified key signalling pathways involved in the host response to infestation. The analysis implicated a number of genes with roles in allergy and inflammation, including pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL 1 A, IL 1 B, IL 6, IL 8 and TNF) and factors involved in immune cell activation and recruitment (SELE, SELL, SELP, ICAM 1, CSF 2, CSF 3, CCL 2 and CXCL 2). The analysis also highlighted the influence of the transcription factors NF-kB and AP- 1 in the early pro-inflammatory response, and demonstrated a bias towards a Th 2 type immune response.
