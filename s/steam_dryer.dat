40|$|This {{concerns}} Flow Induced Vibrations (FIV) {{in nuclear}} reactors and numerical analysis of such. Special {{attention is paid}} to structural excitation by sound generated remotely and turbulent flow around the structure. One hypothesis was that these phenomena can interact, so that the structure accumulates more energy from the flow if it also excited by sound from another source. In the studies, Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) is simulated with Large Eddy Simulations (LES). It is shown possible to simulate excitation due to both acoustic and turbulence loads using the reported methods, at least qualitatively. The excitation levels are even of the right order of magnitude in some parts. However, there are some shortcomings in the modeling. The most important is perhaps the lack of non-reflecting boundary conditions. Another problem is the strong numerical damping in combination with demanding numerics for the selected solid solution methodology. Three cases are simulated, two for validation and one applied about <b>steam</b> <b>dryers.</b> For the applied case, it is concluded unlikely that excitation by the acoustic and turbulence loads can interact. The main reason is that the flow is controlled more by static geometrical factors, such as solid rotation sharp edges, than small deformations due to vibrations. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{harmonic}} {{finite element}} stress analysis method {{is used to}} assess stresses on the Hope Creek Unit 1 (HC 1) <b>steam</b> <b>dryer</b> resulting from acoustic and hydrodynamic loads at 115 % CLTP operating conditions.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. Currently {{there are a number}} of Generation IV SuperCritical Water-cooled nuclear Reactor (SCWR) concepts under development worldwide. The main objectives for developing and utilizing SCWRs are: 1) Increase gross thermal efficiency of current Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) from 33 – 35 % to approximately 45 – 50 %, and 2) Decrease the capital and operational costs and, in doing so, decrease electrical-energy costs (~$ 1000 US/kW or even less). SCW NPPs will have much higher operating parameters compared to current NPPs (i. e., pressures of about 25 MPa and outlet temperatures up to 625 °C). Additionally, SCWRs will have a simplified flow circuit in which <b>steam</b> generators, <b>steam</b> <b>dryers,</b> <b>steam</b> separators, etc. will be eliminated. Furthermore, SCWRs operating at higher temperatures can facilitate an economical co-generation of hydrogen through thermo-chemical cycles (particularly, the copper-chlorine cycle) or direct high-temperature electrolysis. To decrease significantly the development costs of a SCW NPP, to increase its reliability, and to achieve similar high thermal efficiencies as the advanced fossil steam cycles it should be determined whether SCW NPPs can be designed with a steam-cycle arrangement that closely matches that of mature SuperCritical (SC) fossil power plants (including their SC turbine technology). The state-of-the-art SC steam cycles in fossil power plants are designed with a single-steam reheat and regenerative feedwater heating and reach thermal steamcycle efficiencies up to 54 % (i. e., net plant efficiencies of up to 43 % on a Higher Heating Value (HHV) Basis). Therefore, simplified no-reheat, single-reheat, and double-reheat cycles without heat regeneration and a singlereheat cycle with heat regeneration based on the expected steam parameters of future SCW NPPs were analyzed in terms of their thermal efficiencies. On this basis, several conceptual steam-cycle arrangements of pressure-tube SCWRs, their corresponding T–s diagrams and steam-cycle thermal efficiencies (based on constant isentropic turbine and polytropic pump efficiencies) are presented in this paper. vk 201...|$|R
