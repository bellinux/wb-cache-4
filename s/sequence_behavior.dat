By handling genomic sequence residues as elements of a discrete-time signal, digital signal processing techniques can be employed for the analysis of genomic information. Using these representations and applying frequency domain transformations, it is shown that structures, or seemingly nonrandom behavior, may be readily identified in nucleotide sequences. We review the basic method of DNA walks and we show how these representations can be used to extract useful knowledge from the genomic data; namely long-range correlation information, sequence periodicities, and other sequence characteristics. Further information is elucidated through wavelet transform analysis.

Currently, to solve the issue of sharing and reusing teaching materials in different e-learning systems, several standard formats, including SCORM, IMS, LOM, AICC etc., have been proposed by international organizations. Among these international standards, the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) has become the most popular standard in recent years. In the SCORM standard, Sequencing and Navigation (SN), which is based on the concepts of learning activities, defines the course <b>sequencing</b> <b>behavior,</b> which controls the sequencing, selecting and delivering of the course, and organizes the content into a hierarchical structure, namely, an Activity Tree (AT).

40|$|Power {{estimation}} {{has become}} a critical step {{in the design of}} today's ICs. Power dissipation is strongly input pattern dependent and, hence, to obtain accurate power values one must simulate the circuit with a large number of vectors that typify the application data. The goal {{of this paper is to}} present an effective and robust technique for compacting large sequences of input vectors into much smaller ones such that the power estimates are as accurate as possible and the simulation time is reduced by orders of magnitude. Specifically, this paper introduces the hierarchical modeling of Markov chains as a flexible framework for capturing not only complex spatiotemporal correlations, but also the dynamic changes in the sequence characteristics such as different operating modes or power distributions. The new framework is very effective and has a high degree of adaptability: the hierarchical model is dynamically grown according to the <b>sequence</b> <b>behavior</b> and after that is used to generate a new, shorter sequence. As the experimental results show, large compaction ratios can be obtained without significant loss in accuracy (less than 5 % on average) for power estimates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{behavior}} of network entities, such as flows, sessions, hosts, and users, {{can often be}} described by communication event sequences in the time domain. For the purpose of many network measurement and monitoring tasks, it is desirable to have an accurate yet information-compact profiling of the {{behavior of}} massive event sequences. This paper proposes a new method to achieve this goal. On a given set of event sequences, the proposed method automatically learns a mixture model which fully captures the <b>sequence</b> <b>behavior</b> including both event pattern and duration between events. The learned mixture model is information-compact as it classifies sequences into a set of behavior templates, each of which is described by a Markov Chain. The model parameters are estimated in an iterative procedure which is developed from the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Two network management applications are proposed based on the method: a visualization tool for network administrators to conduct exploratory traffic analysis, and an efficient anomaly detection mechanism. In the evaluation, we validate the method accuracy as well as the usefulness of the two applications by using three networking datasets with different types: TCP packet traces, VoIP calls, and syslog traces in wireless networks.

40|$|Analyzing {{sequence}} {{data has}} become increasingly important recently {{in the area of}} biological sequences, text documents, web access logs, etc. In this paper, we investigate the problem of clustering sequences based on their structural features. As a widely recognized technique, clustering has proven to be very useful in detecting unknown object categories and revealing hidden correlations among objects. One difficulty that prevents clustering from being performed extensively on sequence data (in categorical domain) is the lack of an effective yet efficient similarity measure. Therefore, we propose a novel model (CLUSEQ) for sequence cluster by exploring significant statistical properties possessed by the sequences. The conditional probability distribution (CPD) of the next symbol given a preceding segment is derived and used to characterize <b>sequence</b> <b>behavior</b> and to support the similarity measure. A variation of the suffix tree, namely probabilistic suffix tree, is employed to organize (the significant portion of) the CPD in a concise way. A novel algorithm is devised to efficiently discover clusters with high quality and is able to automatically adjust the number of clusters to its optimal range via a unique combination of successive new cluster generation and cluster consolidation. The performance of CLUSEQ has been demonstrated via extensive experiments on several real and synthetic sequence databases. ...|$|E

From 1981 to 1996 we used the recently released Catalogo Strumentale dei Terremoti ‘Italiani’ (CSTI) (Instrumental Catalog Working Group, 2001) joining the data of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) and of the Italian major local seismic network, with magnitude revalued according to Gasperini (2001). From 1960 to 1980 we used instead the Progetto Finalizzato Geodinamica (PFG) catalog (Postpischl, 1985) with magnitude corrected to be homogeneous with the following period. About 40 sequences are detected using two different algorithms and the results of themodeling for the corresponding ones are compared. The average values of distribution parameters (p = 0. 93 ± 0. 21, Log 10 (c) = – 1. 53 ± 0. 54, b = 0. 96 ± 0. 18 and a = – 1. 66 ± 0. 72) are in fair agreement with similar computations performed in other regions of the World.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the efficiency of}} various models in describing the time decay of aftershock rate of 47 simple sequences occurred in California (37) from 1933 to 2004 and in Italy (10) from 1976 to 2004. We compared the models by the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), both based on the log-likelihood function and also including a penalty term {{that takes into account}} the number of independent observations and of free parameters of each model. These criteria follow two different approaches (probabilistic and Bayesian respectively) well covering the wide spectra of current views on model comparison. To evaluate the role of catalog incompleteness in the first times after the main shock, we compared the performance of different models by varying the starting time Ts and the minimum magnitude threshold Mmin for each sequence. We found that Omori-type models including parameter c are preferable to those not including it, only for short Ts and low Mmin while the latters generally perform better than the formers for Ts longer than a few hours and Mmin larger than the main shock magnitude Mm minus 3 units. For TsN 1 day or MminNMm− 2. 5, only about 15 % of the sequences still give a preference to models including c. This clearly indicates that a value of parameter c different from zero does not represent a general property of aftershock sequences in California and Italy but it is very likely induced in most cases by catalog incompleteness in the first times after the main shock. We also considered other models of aftershock decay proposed in the literature: the Stretched Exponential Law in two forms (including and not including a time shift) and the band Limited Power Law (LPL). We found that such models perform worse than the Modified Omori Model (MOM) and other Omori-type models for the large majority of sequences, although for LPL, the relatively short duration of the analyzed sequences (one year) might also contribute to its poor performance. Our analysis demonstrates that the MOMwith c kept fixed to 0 represent the better choice for the modeling (and the forecasting) of simple <b>sequence</b> <b>behavior</b> in California and Italy...|$|E

The contribution of defined nAChR subunits to a specific behavior is thus difficult to assess. Mice deleted for beta 2 -containing nAChRs (beta 2 -/-) {{have been shown to be}} hyperactive in an open-field paradigm, without determining the origin of this hyperactivity. We here develop a quantitative description of mouse behavior in the open field based upon first order Markov and variable length Markov chain analysis focusing on the time-organized <b>sequence</b> that <b>behaviors</b> are composed of. This description reveals that this hyperactivity is the consequence of the absence of specific inactive states or "stops".

They characterize a specific "decision moment" that is reduced in beta 2 -/- mutant mice, suggesting an important role of beta 2 -nAChRs in the strategy used by animals to explore an environment and collect information in order to organize their behavior.
