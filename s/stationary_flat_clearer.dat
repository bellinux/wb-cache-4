The overall objective is to increase the yield percentage by minimizing the carding waste with the help of <b>stationary</b> <b>flats,</b> and also improving the quality of ring spun yarn. This research is partial to the performance of <b>stationary</b> <b>flats</b> only, and does not involve other parts of carding machine. Further research may be carried out on other parts of the carding machine as well.

40|$|The {{intensity}} of a stationary process of k-dimensional affine subspaces (k-flats) of d with directional distribution from a given family R is estimated by observing {{the process in}} a compact window. To this end we introduce a type of unbiased estimator (the R-estimator) using the available information about the directional distribution. Special cases are estimators for the {{intensity of}} stationary k-flat processes (1) with known directional distribution, (2) with directional distribution invariant {{with respect to a}} subgroup of the group of rotations in d and (3) with unknown directional distribution. We give sufficient conditions for the R-estimator to be the uniformly best unbiased estimator for the intensity of stationary Poisson k-flat processes with directional distribution in R. Equivalent statements for certain types of <b>stationary</b> Cox <b>flat</b> processes can be deduced directly from the results in the Poisson case. Moreover, we consider <b>stationary</b> ergodic <b>flat</b> processes with directional distribution in R and general <b>stationary</b> <b>flat</b> processes with unknown directional distribution, all with a non-degeneracy property.

An important feature of this {{problem is that the}} surface tension of the free boundary is taken into account.
