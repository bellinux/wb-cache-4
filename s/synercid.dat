Quinupristin/dalfopristin (<b>Synercid)</b> is active in vitro against VREF, with a MIC 90 of 1. 0 mg/mL. We investigated the clinical efficacy and safety of this agent in a multicenter, prospective, noncomparative, emergency-use study of 396 patients. Patients were included if they had signs and symptoms of active infection, including bacteremia of unknown origin, intra-abdominal infection, and skin and skin-structure infection, with no alternative antibiotic therapy available. The mean duration of treatment was 20 days (range, 4 – 40 days). The clinical response rate was 68. 8 % in the evaluable subset, and the overall response rate was 65. 6 %. The most common adverse events related to quinupristin/dalfopristin were arthralgias and myalgias. Related laboratory abnormalities were rare.

40|$|The semisynthetic {{streptogramin}} antibiotic quinupristin/dalfopristin (trade name <b>Synercid,</b> Aventis Pharma) is {{a mixture}} of the A-type streptogramin dalfopristin and the B-type streptogramin quinupristin, a capped hexapeptide macrolactone. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was developed to combat multidrug resistant pathogens, but suffers from its own problems with drug resistance. Virginiamycin B lyase (Vgb) inactivates the quinupristin component of <b>Synercid</b> by lactone ring opening. Remarkably, the enzyme promotes this reaction by intramolecular β-elimination without the involvement of a water molecule. Recently, structures of S. aureus Vgb in the presence and absence of substrate were reported and used together with detailed mutagenesis data to suggest a catalytic mechanism. Here, we report an independent determination of the S. cohnii Vgb crystal structure and a biochemical characterization of the enzyme. As expected, the S. cohnii and S. aureus Vgb structures and active sites are very similar. Moreover, both enzymes catalyze quinupristin lactone ring opening with similar rate constants, albeit perhaps with different dependencies on divalent metal ions. Replacement of the conserved active site residues His 228, Glu 268, or His 270 with alanine reduces or abolishes S. cohnii Vgb activity.

40|$|Abstract Background and aim: In recent decades, {{inappropriate}} {{antibiotic therapy}} has {{been led to}} the emergence of strains resistant to methicillin and vancomycin. Since the main source of infection and transmission of Staphylococcus aureus is by hospital staff, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of S. aureus strains isolated from hospital staff of Jahrom. Undo edits Methods: In this cross - sectional study, 397 of the anterior nasal samples of medical personnel and hospital services were collected by swab. The identification of S. aureus was determined by biochemical tests and microbiology, and the antibiotic resistances of isolates were determined by disk diffusion method for 13 antibiotics. In this method, the inhibition zone for methicillin-resistant strains was ≤ 10 mm the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against antibiotic vancomycin, ticoplanin, linezolid and <b>synercid</b> were determined by E-test method. Results: In the present study, 11. 3 % of personals carried S. aureus in the nose. Among them, 90 % were health care workers and 10 % were health service workers. The most sensitivity was observed resistance to Ciprofloxacin, rifampin, linezolid and <b>synercid</b> (91. 1 %), but the lowest sensitivity was to penicillin (4. 7 %). of 9 MRSA strains, 1 strain was resistance to vancomycin and 2 strains were resistant to teicoplanin and linezolid.

Daptomycin is the recent FDA-approved lipopeptide, exhibiting potent activity against a broad range of Gram-positive pathogens especially, MRSA and VRE. However, rare incidences of clinical resistance have also been reported against daptomycin (D’Costa et al. [2012]).

After the occurrence of three consecutive cases of bacteraemia with VRE, strains were genotyped and found to be identical. During the next 4 months an intensive surveillance programme identified 21 additional patients to be colonized with VRE, while two more patients developed bacteraemia. A case-control study was carried out to identify risk factors for VRE acquisition. In comparison with VRE-negative control patients (n= 49), cases (n= 24) had a longer stay on the ward during the year preceding the outbreak (25. 8 versus 10. 1 d, P= 0. 02), more cases with acute myeloid leukaemia [11 versus 4, odds ratio (OR) 9. 5, 95 % confidence interval (CI 95) 2. 4 - 32. 2] and higher grades of mucositis (P= 0. 03).

40|$|We {{analyzed}} 62 clinical isolates of streptogramin A-resistant (SGAr) Staphylococcus aureus collected between 1981 and 2001 in 14 hospitals {{located in}} seven French cities. These isolates, including five with decreased susceptibility to glycopeptides, were distributed into 45 antibiotypes and 38 SmaI genotypes. Each of these genotypes included between 1 and 11 isolates, the SmaI patterns of which differed by {{no more than}} three bands. Although numerous clones were identified, we observed the spread of monoclonal isolates either within the same hospital or within hospitals in distinct cities and at large time intervals. Hybridization with probes directed against 10 SGAr genes (vatA, vatB, vatC, vatD, vatE, vgaA, vgaB, vgaAv, vgbA, and vgbB) revealed six patterns: vgaAv (21 isolates), vatA-vgbA (24 isolates), vgaAv-vatB-vgaB (14 isolates), vgaAv-vatA-vgbA (1 isolate), vgaAv-vatA-vgbA-vatB-vgaB (1 isolate), and vgaA (1 isolate). We detected at least one SGAr determinant in all of the tested isolates. vgaAv, {{which is part of the}} recently characterized transposon Tn 5406, was found in 59. 7 % of the tested isolates. Of the 16 streptogramin B-susceptible isolates, 14 carried vgaAv alone and were susceptible to the mixtures of streptogramins, whereas the 2 isolates carrying vgaAv-vatB-vgaB were resistant to these mixtures. vatA-vgbA was found on plasmids of the same apparent size in 26 (42 %) of the tested clinical isolates from 18 unrelated SmaI genotypes.

40|$|Background: Staphylococcus aureus is {{associated}} with different infections ranging from skin and soft tissue infections to endocarditis and fatal pneumonia. S. aureus {{is still the most}} common bacterial species isolated from inpatient specimens and the second most common from outpatient specimens. Today, methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates are present in the hospitals of most countries and are often resistant to several antibiotics. Objectives: This study was performed from 2007 to 2011 to detect prevalence and antibiotic resistance pattern among MRSA and methicillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) isolated from hospitals in Tehran, Iran. Materials and Methods: Totally 726 isolates of S. aureus were collected from three referral hospitals in Tehran. All isolates were identified at the species level using standard biochemical tests. Susceptibility to eighteen antibiotics was determined using disc diffusion method. Then oxacillin and vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of resistant isolates was also determined using Etest. mecA gene was detected using specific primers. Results: A total of 216 (30 %) strains were found to be MRSA isolates. The highest antibiotic resistance was to penicillin, clindamycin, tobramycin and tetracycline respectively. Ninety three and 61 percent of MRSA and MSSA isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR) respectively. However, no strain was resistant to vancomycin, <b>synercid,</b> linezolid and chloramphenicol. Sixty nine percent of MRSA isolates showed high level of resistance to oxacillin (MIC≥ 256 µg/ml). mecA gene was detected among all MRSA isolates. Conclusion: Although the frequency of MRSA isolates in this study was low, but resistance to other antibiotics was high and most of the isolates were found to be MDR. Regular surveillance of hospital-associated infections and monitoring of their antibiotic sensitivity patterns is required to reduce MRSA prevalence. High frequency of MDR isolates of S. aureus could be considered as an urgent warning for public health...|$|E

Sixteen conventional tests {{were used to}} describe and differentiate the 16 isolates of A. sanguinicola from 30 strains of Aerococcus viridans, 27 strains of Aerococcus urinae, and a single strain each of Aerococcus christensenii and Aerococcus urinaehominis. The phenotypic characterizations of the type strains for each species and 14 A. sanguinicola isolates were also compared in the two reference laboratories. A. sanguinicola are catalase-negative, vancomycin-susceptible, gram-positive cocci arranged in clusters and tetrads, as are all Aerococcus species except A. christensenii (which is arranged in short chains). All 16 isolates of A. sanguinicola were leucine aminopeptidase and pyrrolidonylarylamidase positive, which is unique to this species among the aerococci. All A. sanguinicola isolates grew in broth containing 6. 5 % NaCl, hydrolyzed hippurate, and were variable in the bile-esculin test. None of the isolates deaminated arginine or were Voges-Proskauer positive. The type strain of A. sanguinicola was isolated from a blood culture of a patient living in Denmark. Seven additional isolates were from patients living in Canada, all with urinary tract infections (six were female). Eight isolates were from patients living in five different states in the United States; five were from patients with urinary tract infections, and three were from blood cultures of one patient each with pneumonia, suspected endocarditis, and unknown clinical conditions.

40|$|Background: Staphylococcus aureus is {{a common}} cause of infections among humans and animals and it {{is known as a}} community-acquired and {{nosocomial}} pathogen. Most of the isolates contain lysogenic phages which are responsible for production of various virulence factors such as enterotoxins, staphylokinase, β-lysin, lipase, exfoliative toxin A and Pantone-vlaentine leukociden (PVL). All staphylococcus isolates are classified in 6 groups according to their sensitivity to 27 known lysogenic phages. Objectives: This study was performed to detect the presence of bacteriophage types and determine antibiotic resistance pattern of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates obtained from a tertiary care hospital in Tehran, Iran from 2008 to 2010. Materials and Methods: A total of 968 S. aureus isolates were collected from a tertiary care hospital in Tehran, Iran and identified at the species level by PCR and biochemical tests. Susceptibility to 17 antibiotics was determined. Then oxacillin and vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the resistant isolates were determined. Multiplex-PCR was used to detect 6 classes of prophages. Results: Out of the 968 isolates 247 isolates were resistant to methicillin. Highest antibiotic resistance was seen to penicillin (100 %), erythromycin (89. 8 %), kanamycin (89. 4 %), ciprofloxacin (88. 6 %) and tobramycin (87. 4) respectively. None of the MRSA isolates showed resistance to vancomycin, <b>synercid</b> and linezolid. MIC results indicated that 46. 1 and 4. 4 % of isolates with high (MIC ≥ 128 µg/ml) and low level (MIC ≥ 4 µg/ml) showed resistance to oxacillin, respectively. Four different phage types and eight patterns of prophages were detected. All MRSA isolates contained at least one prophage. Totally, 2. 8, 69. 2 and 27. 9 % contained 5, 4 and 3 different prophage types, respectively. Conclusions: High prevalence of different classes of prophages indicating the potential to carry a broad spectrum of ‎virulence factors and high oxacillin resistance were found in the MRSA isolates.

The majority of strains, 3, 100, were methicillin-resistant, of which 1, 749 were coagulase positive (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), and 1, 351 were coagulase negative (methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci, MRCNS). The overall frequency of drug resistance traits among the 1, 749 MRSA strains was high (over 70 % and up to and over 90 % of the strains) to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin, and tetracycline, and was somewhat less frequent to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (45 %), chloramphenicol (30 %), and rifampin (38 %). None of the 3, 307 staphylococcal isolates showed reduced susceptibility to vancomycin except for a single methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative isolate.

The multiresistance patterns of MRSA strains and strains of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci originating at the same country source also showed striking differences, suggesting that resistance to antimicrobial agents emerged under different antibiotic pressures in these bacterial species...|$|E
40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Leon McWilliams, for the Masters of Science Degree in Medical Microbiology and Immunology, {{presented}} March 5, 2009 at Southern Illinois University. IN VITRO ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY OF S. AUREUS IN SUSPENSIONS, BIOFILMS, AND RESUSPENDED BIOFILMS MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Kounosuke Watabe Whether in nature, a laboratory, or in a hospital, microorganisms exist {{by attaching}} themselves to living and nonliving objects. The range of objects microorganisms can adhere to vary from soil, internal medical devices, living tissues such tooth enamel and the lungs (1 - 4). As these microorganisms grow {{on the various}} objects, they develop polysaccharide layers (slime) that aid in attachment and development of a matrix (1). The development of the microorganism colony, and subsequent slime layer, is called a biofilm. The study of biofilms is of such clinical significance because of the microorganisms 2 ̆ 7 altered physiological state in the biofilm. Previous studies have reported that microorganisms have significantly higher resistance in biofilm form as opposed to floating cells (1 - 2, 5). Theories for this phenomenon include slower growth rates of cells, enzymes deactivating the antimicrobials before they can completely diffuse through the biofilm, and the very sub-population of cells that form a biofilm form a highly protected phenotypic state (1, 2, 3). Researchers continue to debate whether this altered physiological state of microorganisms in biofilms is due to intrinsic or extrinsic factors. The increased resistance to antimicrobials makes biofilms a very significance and expensive problem in the medical field. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the medical community spends over 6 billion dollars in its battle against antibiotic-resistant microorganisms (3, 38). Many indwelling medical devices such as catheters and pacemakers are susceptible to development of biofilms. Once a biofilm has been established on an indwelling medical device, clumps of cells periodically break off from the biofilm. These clumps of cells can travel in the blood stream, causing reoccurring systemic infections in the host. Due to biofilms 2 ̆ 7 extraordinary resistance to antimicrobials and the occasional breakage of clumps from the primary structure, an individual infected by a biofilm may have to fight off its ill effects for months, years, even {{the rest of his}} or her life (3). In our research, we will study of Staphylococcus aureus. This microorganism is recognized as a key pathogen in human diseases. S. aureus is a frequent cause of community-acquired infections such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, and septic arthritis (2, 4). According to the CDC, the medical community invests 160 million dollars annually to combat emerging antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus (34). S. aureus 2 ̆ 7 s wide spectrum of diseases is due to its great ability to adhere to many inert and biological surfaces (4).

In total, 799 cloacal swabs and 800 egg samples were taken and examined. The isolation and identification of Salmonella spp., Listeria spp., E. coli/Coliforms, Campylobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. was performed with standardized, cultural methods. Selected isolates of the genera Salmonella (n = 44), Listeria (n = 13), Campylobacter (C. jejuni, n = 218; C. coli, n = 46), Escherichia (E. coli, n = 545; E. fergusonii n = 18; E. hermanii n = 1) Citrobacter (Citrobacter freundii n = 9), Enterobacter (Enterobacter cloacae n = 5; Enterobacter sakazakii n = 3; Enterobacter gergoviae n = 2; Enterobacter asburiae n = 1), Pantoea (Pantoea agglomerans n = 2) and Enterococcus (E. faecalis, n = 361; E. faecium, n = 57; other enterococci [E. nonfaecalis/nonfaecium], n = 569) were tested for their resistance behaviour with respect to 29 different antibiotics by means of microdilution. During the bacteriological investigation of the cloacal swabs, prevalences were found for all bacteria groups in the same order of magnitude in the different rearing systems (Salmonella spp. 3. 5 % (organic [org. ]) vs. 1. 8 % (conventional [con. ]); Listeria spp. : 1. 3 % (org.) vs. 1. 6 % (con.); Campylobacter spp : 34. 8 % (org.) or 29. 0 % (con.); E. coli: 66. 4 % (org.) vs. 72. 0 % (con.); Enterococcus spp. : 95. 5 % (org.) vs. 97. 5 % (con.). Eggs were generally infected with less bacteria, most of which were of the genera Enterococcus and Escherichia, whereas Listeria, Salmonella and Campylobacter were only rarely isolated from the samples. 	 Salmonella of the serovar type S. Typhimurium were resistant to up to nine antibiotics; Salmonella of the serogroup B were resistant to up to 6 different antibiotics. All Salmonella isolates proved to be resistant towards spectinomycin. A high percentage of C. jejuni and C. coli isolates showed resistance to flourquinolones; a similar resistance was observed in the case of ampicillin and doxycycline. The Listeria isolates were mostly sensitive towards the tested antibiotics, and only a few strains showed resistance to clindamycin and imipenem. E. coli isolates showed a high resistance prevalence to ß-lactames, doxycycline, streptomycin, and cefaclor. High percentages (54. 8 %) of E. faecalis were found to be resistant to doxycycline; macrolides were also only marginally effective. The investigated E. faecium isolates proved to have high resistance rates to clindamycin, fosfomycin and erythromycin, while a significant percentage (9. 1 %) of E. faecium had already been classified as resistant to the reserve antibiotic <b>synercid.</b> Other enterococci showed higher resistance rates to doxycycline, erythromycin, fosfomycin, and rifampicine. There were no glykopeptide-resistant enterococci. The analysis of the prevalence rates of sensitive and resistant isolates depending on the keeping system showed a correlation between rearing system and resistance rates: In the case of E. faecalis, a significantly lower prevalence of resistance to tylosin, streptomycin and doxycycline was determined among isolates from organic farms, while significantly higher amounts of isolates were found to be sensitive to enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin; however, when tested on rifampicin and imipenem, E. faecalis behaved contrary to this. E. coli isolates from organic layers showed significantly lower resistance rates or significantly higher amounts of sensitive isolates with regard to nine agents, while in the case of E. coli from conventional rearing systems, these results could only be observed for two antibiotics. In the case of C. jejuni, significantly better rates were observed for isolates from organic flocks with regard to imipenem and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, whereas fosfomycin favoured isolates from conventional layer flocks. In the case of 8 antibiotics, the amounts of sensitive and resistant enterococci of the E. nonfaecalis/nonfaecium group originating from organic farms were found to be higher and lower respectively compared to the isolates from conventional farms. Overall, the comparison of the amounts of sensitive and resistant bacteria isolates and the mean MIC values showed that the isolates from organic layer rearing systems scored much better statistically than those from conventional systems. The results show that organic layer flocks reduce the amount of bacteria resistant to antibiotics, as both the resistance rates of the selected bacteria to certain antibiotics as well as the mean MIC values for certain antibiotic agents were lower in organic systems than in conventional ones. Thus, organic livestock farming contributes towards securing the continued effectiveness of anti-infectives...|$|E
40|$|Biofilm {{production}} {{is an important}} step in the pathogenesis of S. epidermidis polymer-associated infections and depends on the expression of the icaADBC operon leading to the synthesis of a polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA). The PIA represents a sugar polymer consisting of ß- 1, 6 linked N-acetyl glucosaminoglycans and mediates the intercellular adherence of the bacteria to each other and the accumulation of a multilayered biofilm. Epidemiological and experimental studies strongly suggest that PIA-production and subsequently biofilm formation contributes significantly to the virulence of specific S. epidermidis strains. This work aimed on the investigation of external factors regulating the ica expression in S. epidermidis. For this purpose, a reporter gene fusion between the ica promoter and the beta-galactosidase gene lacZ from E. coli was constructed and integrated into the chromosome of an ica positive S. epidermidis clinical isolate. The reporter gene fusion was used to investigate the influence of external factors and of sub-MICs of different antibiotics on the ica expression. It was shown that the S. epidermidis biofilm formation is growth phase dependent with a maximum expression in the late logarithmic and early stationary growth phase. The optimal expression was recorded at 42 °C at a neutral pH ranging from 7. 0 to 7. 5. The glucose content of the medium was found to be essential for biofilm formation, since concentrations of 1. 5 to 2 per cent glucose induced the ica expression. In addition, external stress factors as high osmolarity (mediated by 3 to 5 per cent sodium chloride), and sub-lethal concentrations of detergents, ethanol, hydrogene peroxide, and urea significantly enhanced the biofilm production. Subinhibitory concentrations of tetracyline, the semisynthetic streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin and the streptogramin growth promoter virginiamycin were found to enhance the ica expression 8 to 11 -fold, respectively, whereas penicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, clindamycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, ofloxacin, and chloramphenicol had no effects. A weak induction was recorded for sub-MICs of erythromycin. Both quinupristin/ dalfopristin and tetracyline exhibited a strong postexposure effect on the S. epidermidis ica expression, respectively, even when the substances were immediately removed from the growth medium. The results were confirmed by Northern blot analysis of the ica transcription and quantitative analysis of biofilm formation in a colorimetric assay. Expression of the icaprom::lacZ reporter gene plasmid in Bacillus subtilis and S. epidermidis revealed that the ica induction by sub-MICs of streptogramins and tetracycline might depend on unidentified regulatory elements which are specific for the staphylococcal cell. In contrast, the activation by external stress signals seems to be mediated by factors which are present both in Staphylococci and in Bacillus subtilis. Construction and analysis of an agr-mutant in a biofilm-forming S. epidermidis strain excluded the possibility that the Agr-quorum-sensing system significantly contributes to the ica expression in the stationary growth phase. However, clear evidence was provided that in S. aureus the ica transcription depends on the expression of the alternative transcription factor sigmaB, which represents a global regulator of the stress response in S. aureus as well as in B. subtilis. For this purpose, a sigB knockout mutant had been constructed in a biofilm-forming S. aureus. This mutant showed a markedly decrease of the ica transcription and biofilm-production, whereas a complement strain carrying the sigB gene on an expression vector completely restored the biofilm-forming phenotype of the S. aureus wild type. Southern blot analysis indicated that the the sigB gene is also present in S. epidermidis and Northern analyses of the sigB and the ica transcription revealed that both genes are activated under identical conditions (i. e. in the stationary growth phase and by external stress factors) suggesting a similar regulatory pathway as in S. aureus. However, since neither in S. aureus nor in S. epidermidis the ica promoter has obvious similiarities to known SigB-dependent promotoer sequences it is tempting to speculate that the ica activation is not directely mediated by SigB, but might be indirectely controlled by other SigB-dependent regulatory elements which remain to be elucidated. Die Ausbildung von Biofilmen ist ein wichtiger Schritt in der Pathogenense von Polymer-assoziierten Infektionen durch S. epidermidis. Sie hängt von der Expression des icaADBC-Operons ab, das die Syntheseenzyme für die Produktion eines extrazellulären Polysaccharids (PIA) kodiert. PIA steht für Polysaccharid-Interzelluläres-Adhäsin. Diese Substanz stellt ein beta- 1, 6 verknüpftes N-Acetyl-Glukosaminoglycan dar, das den Bakterien extrazellulär aufliegt, die Adhärenz der Zellen untereinander vermittelt und so die Akkumulation eines Biofilms wesentlich fördert. Epidemiologische und experimentelle Studien haben gezeigt, daß die PIA-Produktion und damit die Biofilmbildung wesentlich zur Virulenz bestimmter S. epidermidis Stämme beiträgt. Die vorliegende Arbeit zielte auf die Untersuchung äußerer Faktoren ab, die die PIA-Expression in S. epidermidis regulieren. Dazu wurde eine Genfusion zwischen dem ica-Promotor und dem beta-Galaktosidasegen aus E. coli hergestellt und stabil in das Chromosom eines ica-positiven S. epidermidis Klinikisolates integriert. Das Reportergenkonstrukt wurde benutzt, um den Einfluß verschiedener Umweltfaktoren und die Wirkung subinhibitorischer Antibiotikadosen auf die Expression des ica-Operons zu bestimmen. Es konnte gezeigt werden, daß die ica-Expression wachstumsphasenabhängig ist und ihr Maximum in der späten logarhitmischen und frühen stationären Phase erreicht. Die optimale Expressionstemperatur liegt bei 42 °C und einem neutralen pH-Wert in einem Bereich zwischen 7, 0 und 7, 5. Die Biofilmbildung hängt stark vom Glukosegehalt des Wachstumsmediums ab. So wurde gezeigt, daß 1, 5 bis 2 Prozent im Kulturmedium die ica-Expression in der logarhitmischen Phase induzieren. Externe Stressfaktoren wie erhöhte Osmolarität durch 3 bis 5 Prozent NaCl oder sublethale Dosen von Detergenzien, Äthanol, Wasserstoffperoxid und Harnstoff begünstigen ebenfalls die ica-Expression und damit die Biofilmbildung. Subinhibitorische Dosen von Tetrazyklin, des Streptogramingemisches Quinupristin/Dalfopristin (<b>Synercid?)</b> sowie des Streptogramin-Leistungsförderers Virginiamycin führten zu einer Erhöhung der ica-Expression um das 8 bis 11 -fache. Eine kurzzeitige Exposition der Bakterien zu hohen Konzentrationen dieser Antibiotika führte ebenfalls zu einer langanhaltenden Induktion der Biofilmexpression, auch wenn die Stoffe aus dem Wachstumsmedium sofort wieder entfernt worden waren. Andere Antibiotika wie Penicillin, Oxacillin, Gentamicin, Clindamycin, Vancomycin, Teicoplanin und Chloramphenicol zeigten keinerlei Effekt auf die ica-Expression. Eine schwache Induktion wurde dagegen für Erythromycin verzeichnet. Die Daten wurden durch Northernblotanalysen der ica–Transkription und durch einen quantitativen Biofilmassay in Polystyrol-Mikrotiterplatten bestätigt. Die Propagierung des Reportergenkonstruktes als Plasmid sowohl in einem B. subtili- Hintergrund als auch in einem ica-negativen S. epidermidis-Stamm ergab, daß die Induktion des ica-Operons durch niedrige Tetrazyklin- oder Streptograminkonzentrationen möglicherweise von spezifischen Regulatoren abhängt, die nur in Staphylokokken vorkommen. Im Gegensatz dazu ist die Induktion durch externe Sressfaktoren sowohl in B. subtilis als auch in S. epidermidis möglich. Durch die Herstellung und Untersuchung einer agr-Mutante in einem Biofilm-bildenden S. epidermidis-Stamm konnte ausgeschlossen werden, daß das Agr-Quorum-Sensing-System einen wesentlichen Einfluß auf die ica-Expression in der stationären Phase ausübt. Dagegen wurde klar gezeigt, daß die ica-Transkription in S. aureus von der Expression des alternativen Transkriptionsfaktors SigmaB abhängt, der einen globalen Regulator für die Stressantwort in Staphylokokken und in B. subtilis darstellt. Zu diesem Zweck war eine sigB-Deletionsmutante in einem Biofilm-bildenden S. aureus-Stamm hergestellt worden. Diese Mutante zeigte eine deutlich verminderte ica Transkription und Biofilmbildung. Dagegen wies die Komplementante, die das sigB-Gen auf einem Expressionsvektor trug, wieder alle Merkmale des Biofilm-bildenden S. aureus Wildtyps auf. Southernblot-Analysen zeigten, daß das sigB-Gen auch in S. epidermidis nachweisbar ist und unter denselben Bedingungen (d. h. in der stationären Phase und durch externen Stress) wie das ica Gen transkribiert wird. Das läßt vermuten, daß die Regulation des ica-Operons in S. epidermidis ähnlich abläuft wie in S. aureus und durch SigB beeinflußt wird. Da jedoch weder in S. aureus noch in S. epidermidis der ica-Promotor Ähnlichkeiten zu den bekannten SigB-abhängigen Promotor-Strukturen aufweist, ist anzunehemen, daß dieses Operon nicht direkt durch diesen alternativen Transkriptionsfaktor kontrolliert wird. Wahrscheinlich existieren noch weitere regulatorische Elemente, die hieran beteiligt sind und die noch zu identifizieren sind...|$|E
