5|$|Bubbles {{was kept}} at the Jackson family's Encino home until 1988 {{when he was}} moved to Jackson's newly {{acquired}} Neverland Ranch. There, Bubbles <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> crib in the singer's bedroom, ate candy in the Neverland movie theater, was fed at the dining table, wore a diaper, and relieved himself in Jackson's personal toilet.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bedroom next to {{the front}} door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single bed {{next to the}} bedroom door, {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles was {{initially}} kept at the Jackson family's home in Encino, Los Angeles, but {{was moved to}} Neverland Ranch in 1988. There, he <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> crib in Jackson's bedroom, used the singer's toilet and ate candy in the Neverland movie theater. By 2003, like many captive chimpanzees, Bubbles had matured into a large and aggressive adult chimp unsuitable as a companion animal. He {{was sent to a}} California animal trainer. When the trainer closed his operation in 2004, Bubbles was moved to the Center for Great Apes, a sanctuary in Wauchula, Florida, where he has lived since 2005.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I think,' {{said the}} beggar, 'that Ulysses {{will be here}} before any of the wooers have bent his bow.' Then Penelope went to her upper chamber, and Ulysses <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> outer gallery of the house on piled-up sheep skins.|$|R
5|$|Géricault, who {{had just}} been forced to break off a painful affair with his aunt, shaved his head and from November 1818 to July 1819 lived a disciplined monastic {{existence}} in his studio in the Faubourg du Roule, being brought meals by his concierge and only occasionally spending an evening out. He and his 18-year-old assistant, Louis-Alexis Jamar, <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small room adjacent to the studio; occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion Jamar walked off; after two days Géricault persuaded him to return. In his orderly studio, the artist worked in a methodical fashion in complete silence and found that even the noise of a mouse was sufficient to break his concentration.|$|E
5|$|Jackson gave a 90-minute {{interview}} to Oprah Winfrey on February 10, 1993, his second television interview since 1979. He grimaced when speaking {{of his childhood}} abuse {{at the hands of}} his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of the Elephant Man, <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated {{for the first time that}} he had vitiligo. Dangerous re-entered the album chart in the top 10, more than a year after its original release.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{then had}} stints working for KDNT in Denton, Texas, KCUL and KCNC in Fort Worth, Texas, where he hosted The Western Express, taught Sunday school {{and he played}} in nightclubs. He then {{decided to move to}} San Diego. He was unable to find a job, and decided to go to Portland, Oregon, where his mother lived. Nelson tried to hitchhike, but after nobody picked him up, he <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ditch. He then found a nearby {{railroad}} yard and boarded a freight train that left him in Eugene. A truck driver then drove Nelson to a bus station and loaned him $10 for a ticket to reach Portland.|$|E
50|$|His {{domestic}} {{arrangements were}} equally peculiar. Although he wasn't poor, his vicarage was furnished with rough-hewn logs, instead of chairs. His children ate their meals from a trough {{next to the}} split-log dining table. He and his wife <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> enormous wicker cradle suspended from the ceiling.|$|R
50|$|Susie Ramadan started {{training}} {{at a young}} age at the Brizzi Brothers gym in Reservoir Melbourne.She is known to complete a wide variety of training before her fights. In preparation for her World Title bout in Mexico City in October 2014, she trained and <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> altitude tent, enabling her to acclimatise.|$|R
50|$|Canoville {{started out}} playing semi-professionally for Southern League side Hillingdon Borough, and <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{abandoned}} car {{as he had}} nowhere to stay. At Borough he was moved from centre-half to the wings, where his pace was a greater asset. After two successful seasons with the club he had trials with Southampton and Chelsea.|$|R
5|$|Eldred {{arrived in}} Italy in July 1918 and {{eventually}} at Sub Chaser Base 25, located in Corfu, Greece in September 1918. There {{he served as}} a machinist aboard submarine chaser SC-244, where they patrolled the Strait of Otranto and were engaged in combat. While in Corfu, Eldred and many others got sick with the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic. The conditions at the hospital were so bad that he had to crawl to a stream to get water, which resulted in a permanent scar on his left hip. Eldred began his return to the United States and arrived in Malta on December 25, 1918. By February 1919, he was in Gibraltar. He was given the option of staying in the Navy until they arrived home in six months or being discharged and paying his own way home. He elected the discharge and was separated from the Navy on March 4, 1919. He met some U.S. Army soldiers who were en route to America aboard an Army troop ship. They took him aboard as a stowaway and loaned him an Army uniform. Eldred <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> life boat {{on the way back to}} America.|$|E
5|$|Gaddafi's {{earliest}} {{education was}} of a religious nature, imparted by a local Islamic teacher. Subsequently, moving to nearby Sirte to attend elementary school, he progressed through six grades in four years. Education in Libya was not free, but his father thought it would greatly benefit his son despite the financial strain. During the week Gaddafi <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mosque, and at weekends walked 20 miles to visit his parents. At school, Gaddafi was bullied for being a Bedouin, but {{was proud of his}} identity and encouraged pride in other Bedouin children. From Sirte, he and his family moved to the market town of Sabha in Fezzan, south-central Libya, where his father worked as a caretaker for a tribal leader while Muammar attended secondary school, something neither parent had done. Gaddafi was popular at this school; some friends made there received significant jobs in his later administration, most notably his best friend Abdul Salam Jalloud.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners' {{day began}} at 4:30 am (an hour later in winter) with morning roll call. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli {{describes}} roll call as beginning 03:00 and lasting four hours. The weather was cold in Auschwitz {{at that time}} of day, even in summer. The prisoners were ordered to line up outdoors in rows of five and had to stay there until 07:00, when the SS officers arrived. Meanwhile, the guards would force the prisoners to squat for an hour with their hands above their heads or levy punishments such as beatings or detention for infractions such as having a missing button or an improperly cleaned food bowl. The inmates were counted and re-counted. Nyiszli describes how even the dead had to be present at roll call, standing supported by their fellow inmates until the ordeal was over. When he was a prisoner in 1944–45, five to ten men were found dead in the barracks each night. The prisoners assigned to Mengele's staff <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate barracks and were awoken at 07:00 for a roll call that only took a few minutes.|$|E
50|$|During the walk, Cracker Barrel donated 50 {{meals to}} Zach Bonner {{and his fellow}} walkers. At night, he; his sister, Kelley; and his mother, Laurie; <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> RV. The RV would be parked in state parks, and every morning, Bonner and his fellow walkers would be transported by a car to the {{stopping}} point of the preceding day.|$|R
50|$|Closed-beds were 1.60 to 1.70 m length, {{long enough}} for people of that region who were rather small. And because they <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> almost sitting position, they leaned on three or four pillows. It was the {{tradition}} of the Middle Ages not to sleep lying down, because that is the position of the dead and of effigies.|$|R
5000|$|Roberts {{contracted}} polio {{at the age}} {{of fourteen}} in 1953, two years before the Salk vaccine ended the epidemic. He spent eighteen months in hospitals and returned home paralyzed from the neck down except for two fingers on one hand and several toes. He <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> iron lung at night and often rested there during the day. When out of the lung he survived by [...] "frog breathing," [...] a technique for forcing air into the lungs using facial and neck muscles.|$|R
25|$|In {{his role}} as a {{mortuary}} attendant, Gacy <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cot behind the embalming room. In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed to the fact that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.|$|E
25|$|From 1804 onward, {{when the}} King {{displayed}} a declining mental health, Queen Charlotte <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate bedroom, had her meals separated from him, and avoided seeing him alone. From this time, Charlotte cultivated a better {{relationship with her}} eldest son the Prince of Wales together with her daughters Princess Augusta and Princess Elizabeth, and her sons the Dukes of Clarence, Kent and Sussex, while her younger daughters {{as well as her}} other sons (the Dukes of York, Cumberland and Cambridge) supported their father.|$|E
25|$|It was {{constructed}} {{as a traditional}} aliʻi residence with only ceremonial spaces, no sleeping rooms. It just had a throne room, a reception room, and a state dining room, with other houses around for sleeping and for retainers. Kamehameha III <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cooler grass hut around the palace. He called his home Hoʻihoʻikea, a separate building flanking the palace {{on the west side}} in honor of his restoration after the Paulet Affair of 1843. Kamehameha IV build a separate house {{on the east side of}} the palace called Ihikapukalani (on the mauka side) and Kauluhinano (on the makai side).|$|E

50|$|The one-room school house (c. 1800) was renovated and {{expanded}} in the 1950s {{for use as}} a lake cottage with kitchen, bathroom and sleeping loft. This building is a square-hewn wood log cabin. The Tarry family sheathed this building in barn siding and added a tin roof when the cottage was built. It was a girls' school for families in Mecklenburg County, Virginia, until the early 1900s. The teacher <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> upstairs loft. After the school closed, the structure was used as a blacksmith shop.|$|R
25|$|In the {{precarious}} and spare environment of Rio, the king's personal habits were simple. In {{contrast to his}} relative isolation in Portugal, he became more personally dynamic and interested in nature. He moved frequently between the Paço de São Cristóvão and the viceregal palace in the city, staying also at times at Paquetá Island, Governador Island, at Praia Grande (the beach at Niterói), and at the House of Santa Cruz. He went hunting and happily <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tent or under a tree. He liked the countryside, despite the swarms of mosquitoes and other pests and the scorching heat of the tropics that were detested {{by the majority of}} the Portuguese and other foreigners.|$|E
25|$|In June 1994, {{the family}} lived at 65 Every Street, Andersons Bay, Dunedin. The house {{was old and}} 'semi-derelict'. At this time Robin and Margaret were estranged. Robin was {{initially}} sleeping {{in the back of}} his van at Taieri, but more recently in the schoolhouse three nights a week. He returned to the family home at weekends but <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> caravan in the back garden. David was studying music and classics at Otago University and had a part-time job delivering morning newspapers. Arawa was attending a teachers' training college and Stephen was at high school. Laniet had a part-time job in Dunedin and lived away from home, but had returned to the family residence on the Sunday evening of 19 June to attend a family meeting.|$|E
25|$|Takahashi's {{professional}} career began in 1978. Her first published work was the one-shot Katte na Yatsura, {{for which she}} was awarded the Shogakkan New Comics Award. Later that same year, she began her first serialized story in Weekly Shōnen Sunday; Urusei Yatsura, a comedic science fiction story. She had difficulty meeting deadlines to begin with, so chapters were published sporadically until 1980. During {{the run of the}} series, she shared a small apartment with two assistants, and often <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> closet {{due to a lack of}} space. During the same year, she published Time Warp Trouble, Shake Your Buddha, and the Golden Gods of Poverty in Weekly Shōnen Sunday magazine, which would remain the home to most of her major works for the next twenty years.|$|E
50|$|Creekmore {{joined the}} Army Air Force during World War II {{and became a}} Captain. He was {{assigned}} to draw Army pilots in their varied duties including the Tokyo Superfortress raids and sketches of the Army in Guam, Puerto Rico, Greenland, the Baffin Islands, and <b>in</b> Newfoundland—where he <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> igloo. He still kept a writing journal of his experiences during the war. Meanwhile, he had married and had a son. The family, at that time, lived in Mamaroneck, New York, and after the war, taught at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute.|$|R

60|$|Before {{the stars}} paled, Scott, who <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> empty cart, waked and went {{about his work}} in silence; it seemed at that hour unkind to rouse Faiz Ullah and the interpreter. His head being close to the ground, he did not hear William till she stood over him in the dingy old riding-habit, her eyes still heavy with sleep, {{a cup of tea}} and a piece of toast in her hands. There was a baby on the ground, squirming on a piece of blanket, and a six-year-old child peered over Scott's shoulder.|$|R
25|$|On December 14, 1999, Corinne Caillaux, 36, {{was stabbed}} {{to death in the}} {{lavatory}} of a Calais to Ventimiglia overnight train while her infant son <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> carriage. Guards found her slumped {{in a pool of blood}} in a train toilet. She had been stabbed at least 13 times while her 6-year-old son lay sleeping, and died later from her injuries. The inspectors found a blood-soaked baseball hat close to her body. Rezala was wearing a similar cap when he was found travelling without a ticket about two hours earlier, on the journey from Calais to Ventimiglia on the Italian frontier. DNA tests are being conducted on hairs found in the hat. Police have records of Rezala's DNA taken after earlier crimes.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 {{he tried}} to attack his own world record for the third {{consecutive}} time at the Dubai Marathon 2010. Although he won the race with a time of 2:06:09, he failed to break his 18-month world record. In a post-race interview he revealed that he had suffered back pain, requiring intensive pre-race physiotherapy, resulting from having <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bad position. His problems continued at the NYC Half Marathon, where he pulled up mid-race visibly uncomfortable in his running. He had an easy victory in the inaugural edition of the 10K de Madrid in April. He scored his third victory at the Great Manchester Run the following month, although he missed out on Micah Kogo's course record. He followed this with his first win at the Great North Run in September, finishing the half marathon in a time of 59:33 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks {{clearly had}} been {{influenced}} by their Egyptian neighbors, in terms of medical practice in surgery and medication, but the Greeks also absorbed many folk healing practices, including incantations and dream healing. In Homer's Iliad and Odyssey the gods are implicated {{as the cause of}} plagues or widespread disease and that those maladies could be cured by praying to them. This religious side of healing clearly manifested in the cult of Asclepius, whom Homer regarded as the great physician, and was deified in the third and fourth century BC. Hundreds of temples devoted to Asclepius have been found throughout the Greek and Roman empire to which untold numbers of people have flocked for cures. Healing visions and dreams formed the foundation for the curing process as the person seeking treatment from Asclepius <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> special dormitory. The healing occurred either in the person's dream or advice from the dream could be used to seek out proper treatment for illness elsewhere. Afterwards the visitor to the temple bathed, offered prayers and sacrifice, and received other forms of treatment like medication, dietary restrictions, and an exercise regiment, keeping with the Hippocratic tradition.|$|E
6000|$|Convulsions came; and, {{where the}} field [...] Long <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> {{pastoral}} green, <b>A</b> goblin-mountain was upheaved (Sure the scared sense was all deceived), [...] Marl-glen and slag-ravine.|$|R
25|$|On Tuesday, July 12, Speck {{returned}} to the NMU hiring hall and <b>in</b> mid-afternoon received <b>an</b> assignment on Sinclair Oil's tanker SS Sinclair Great Lakes, a thirty-minute drive away in East Chicago, Indiana, but when he arrived there he found his spot had already been taken and was driven back to the by then closed NMU hiring hall. Speck {{did not have enough}} money for a rooming house, so he dropped off his bags six blocks east at the Manor Shell filling station at 9954 S. Torrence Ave. and <b>slept</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unfinished house just off E. 103rd St.|$|R
50|$|In December 1991, {{at the age}} of 72, Lady Fisher <b>slept</b> rough <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nest of {{cardboard}} boxes at Birmingham's St Philip's Cathedral {{to draw attention to the}} plight of the city's homeless.|$|R
