40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} leakage {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seals including the flow field characteristic <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seal {{and the effects}} of structural parameters on the leakage characteristic <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seals with the consideration of bristle deflection. The flow field characteristic <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seal was discussed based on three-dimensional (3 -D) computational model <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seal, two-way fluid–structure interaction and moving grid technique. Then the effect of structural parameters on the leakage characteristic <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seals was investigated from theoretical and numerical simulation perspectives with the emphasis on an improved prediction formula of leakage flow rate <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seals. As illustrated in the analysis of the leakage characteristics <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seals, (1) the leakage with the influence of bristle deflection is closer to the results of experiment relative to that without bristle deflection, and increases with the increasing inlet/outlet pressure ratios, which validate the developed 3 -D computational model with bristle deflection to be more reasonable; (2) the flow field characteristics (pressure and velocity) <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seal are revealed reasonably; (3) with the increasing of the height of backing plate fence, the clearance <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> wire and the axial clearance between brush bristle and back plate, the leakage factor rises and then reaches a stable value when the clearance <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> is larger than 0. 3 mm; moreover, (4) with the increase <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> wire diameter, the leakage factor decreases firstly and then tends to stabilization, while rapidly decreases at first, then slowly decreases, and lastly tends to a value when the bristle row number increases; (5) the reliability and accuracy of the proposed prediction equation for brush seals is validated to be high by the CFD computational results. The efforts of this paper provide a useful theoretical and numerical method to clearly understand the leakage characteristics <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seal, which is beneficial to improve the design <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> seals.

Here a family of polybasic poly(2 -(diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) brushes have been grown using ARGET ATRP from a cationic macroinitiator adsorbed on two types of silica surfaces: QCM crystals and oxidised silicon wafers. The pH-response <b>of</b> these <b>brushes</b> is investigated as a function <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> thickness in a constant flow environment in order {{to focus on the}} intrinsic dynamics <b>of</b> the polymer <b>brushes.</b> Independent QCM-D and in situ ellipsometry kinetic studies demonstrate the swelling process of protonation and solvent uptake is typically eight times faster than the corresponding neutralisation and solvent expulsion from the collapsing brush. However, the maximum rate of these processes is independent <b>of</b> <b>brush</b> thickness. The initial pH response <b>of</b> the <b>brushes</b> is hysteretic due to brush entanglement, which once overcome allows highly reversible pH-induced conformational changes.
