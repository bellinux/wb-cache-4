Although Bradford were a League Two side, Brandon said it would be the highlight of his career to play for his hometown club.|$|E
5|$|Chernow, {{a former}} {{business}} journalist, {{was inspired to}} write the book while researching another biography on Washington's long-time aide Alexander Hamilton. Washington: A Life took <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> complete and makes extensive use of archival evidence. The book was released to wide acclaim from critics, several of whom called it the best biography of Washington ever written. In 2011, the book won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, as well as the New-York Historical Society's American History Book Prize.|$|E

5|$|Mendelssohn {{originally}} {{proposed the}} idea of the violin concerto to Ferdinand David, a close friend and then concertmaster of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. Although conceived in 1838, the work took another <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> complete and was not premiered until 1845. During this time, Mendelssohn maintained a regular correspondence with David, who gave him many suggestions. The work itself was one of the foremost violin concertos of the Romantic era and was influential on many other composers.|$|E
5|$|Seed {{multiplication}} may be {{used for}} the development of new cultivars or to increase the yield of native species. Seeds are generally sown in early summer in seedbeds, and then transplanted to larger containers. They require warmth frequent watering, and should not be given a dormant period. Seeds do not breed true. Plants obtained from seeds take about <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> bloom.|$|E

5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> flower from seed, {{though there}} is a report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia {{depends on}} fire for regeneration; if fires are too infrequent, populations age and {{eventually}} die out. However, too-frequent fires also threaten this species, which takes around <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> reach maturity and flower. One study estimated an optimum fire interval of 15–30years. For {{a large part}} of its distribution Banksia ericifolia grows near areas of human habitation on Australia's eastern coastline. Bushland near urban areas is subject to both arson and prescribed burns, drastically reducing fire intervals and resulting in the disappearance of the species from some areas. The hotter a fire the more quickly seed is released; timing of rains afterwards is also critical for seedling survival.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, when {{alternative}} rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as {{a pioneer of}} the genre. The band then released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound and catapulted it to international fame. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was {{a return to a}} more rock-oriented sound, but still continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members.|$|E

5|$|Fearful of Hereford's power, Richard {{unjustly}} {{orders that}} his cousin be {{banished from the}} realm for <b>six</b> <b>years,</b> <b>to</b> the dismay of the House of Commons and many others. Slowly dying of old age, Gaunt's final advice to Richard, that he put aside his favourites and become a just king, falls on deaf ears. Gaunt dies soon after; Richard becomes increasingly dictatorial and prevents Gaunt's vast inheritance from being granted to Bolingbroke; his banishment is converted to life, though his sons remain in the country. In the wake of these troublesome events, Richard leaves England for Ireland, a decision widely considered folly considering the turmoil England is in. Bolingbroke returns to England and many nobleman flock to his banner; Richard is overthrown.|$|E
5|$|In {{writing the}} book that would become Washington: A Life, Chernow made {{extensive}} use of the archival evidence left by Washington's meticulous record-keeping. These documents included recently discovered written correspondence, maps, and images from the Papers of George Washington, made available by a University of Virginia research project, which began in 1968. Washington: A Life took <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> complete, {{the first four years}} of which were spent purely on research. In June 2009, {{near the end of his}} work on the book, Chernow slipped on a stair and broke his ankle in the three places. He was unable to do anything but read for the following months, and later attributed the injury with allowing him to return to the book with a fresh perspective and improve the manuscript.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the easier}} Western species to grow, Banksia lemanniana has some horticultural {{potential}} in its attractive chocolate buds, green-yellow hanging flower spikes and large grey spikes with prominent follicles. It generally grows quite quickly, but nevertheless takes five to <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> flower from seed. It prefers a more alkaline rocky or sandy soil, with a nominal pH range from 6 to 7.5. It favours a sunny position and good drainage, {{and has been}} successfully cultivated in more humid climates on Australia's east coast. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 43 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|P. lanceolata shrubs {{destroyed}} by bushfire regenerate through seedlings surviving through seedbank in the soil. The Ku-ring-gai Chase {{study found that}} seedlings germinated within two years of a 1994 bushfire, although some appeared up to six years afterwards, while germination {{was not related to}} any particular season. Plants take <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> reach maturity. Thus, more frequent bushfires prevent recruitment and hence endanger populations. However, plants in Lane Cove National Park were recorded maturing three years after an especially intense bushfire. What triggers germination is unknown, and seedlings have also arisen from areas disturbed by sand mining, sometimes growing in higher concentrations than before the disturbance. The natural lifespan of a plant appears to range from 25 to 60 years.|$|E
5|$|Scripps began {{trafficking}} in drugs, and carried heroin between Asia and Europe for a syndicate. Singapore authorities first encountered {{his name in}} 1987, {{when he was arrested}} at Heathrow Airport for possessing drugs. Police found a key on him that belonged to a safe deposit box in a bank in Orchard Road in Singapore, from which officers from Singapore's Central Narcotics Bureau seized 1.5kilogrammes (3.3lb) of heroin worth about US$1 million. For this and another drug offence, Southwark Crown Court in January 1988 sentenced him to seven years in jail. He escaped while on home leave but was later re-arrested. In July 1992, Winchester Crown Court added another <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> the original sentence, which would have kept him behind bars until 2001 had he not escaped again.|$|E
5|$|Trials in Western Australia and Hawaii {{have shown}} B. aemula to be {{resistant}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. It requires a well drained slightly acid (pH 5.5–6.5) soil, preferably fairly sandy and a sunny aspect. Summer watering is also prudent, {{as it does}} not suffer water stress well. Slow-growing, the plant takes four to <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> flower from seed. It is less commonly grown than Banksia serrata. An investigation into optimum temperatures for germination found a nighttime temperature of 20–28°C, and a daytime of 24–33°C gave best results, and recommended summer planting times.|$|E

5|$|On April 2, 1955, deHavilland married Pierre Galante, an {{executive}} {{editor for the}} French journal Paris Match. Her marriage to Galante prompted her relocation to Paris. The couple separated in 1962, but continued {{to live in the}} same house for another <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> raise their daughter together. Galante moved across the street and the two remained close, even after the finalization of the divorce in 1979. She looked after him during his final bout with lung cancer prior to his death in 1998. They had one child, Gisèle Galante, who was born on July 18, 1956. After studying law at the Université de Droit de Nanterre School of Law, she worked as a journalist in France and the United States. Since 1956, deHavilland has lived in the same three-story house near Bois de Boulogne park in the Rive Droite section of Paris.|$|E
5|$|The concerto {{took another}} <b>six</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> complete. There are many {{possible}} {{reasons for the}} delay, including self-doubt, his third symphony and an unhappy period in Berlin after a request from King Frederick William IV of Prussia. Nevertheless, Mendelssohn and David kept up a regular correspondence during this time, with Mendelssohn seeking technical and compositional advice. Indeed, this violin concerto {{was the first of}} many to have been composed with the input of a professional violinist, and would influence many future collaborations. The autographed score is dated 16 September 1844, but Mendelssohn was still seeking advice from David until its premiere. The concerto was first performed in Leipzig on 13 March 1845 with Ferdinand David as soloist. Mendelssohn was unable to conduct due to illness and the premiere was conducted by the Danish composer Niels Gade. Mendelssohn first conducted the concerto on 23 October 1845 again with Ferdinand David as soloist.|$|E
