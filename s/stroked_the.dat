One {{of the men}} was 54-year-old Glenn Hollinshead – a {{self-employed}} welder, qualified paramedic, and former RAF worker. The other man was his friend Peter Molloy. Sabina appeared friendly and <b>stroked</b> <b>the</b> dog as the three people struck up a conversation. Although friendly, Sabina appeared to be behaving oddly and this odd behaviour worried Molloy. Sabina asked the two men for directions to any nearby bed and breakfasts or hotels. Hollinshead took pity upon her and instead offered to take her back to his house at Duke Street, Fenton. Sabina accepted the offer and the three walked to the house, as Sabina told the men how {{she was trying to}} locate her hospitalised sister.|$|E

25|$|Chitty rowed in the Oxford University crew in {{both the}} Boat Races that were run in 1849, the March race and the December race, each {{university}} winning once. He rowed in the Oxford University eight that won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta in 1850 {{when there was no}} Boat Race on the Tideway. He also rowed in the Oxford coxed four that won the Stewards' Challenge Cup at Henley and in the same year he won the Silver Goblets, the first year the coxless pair event was run under that name. His partner was James John Hornby and they beat Thomas Howard Fellows and C L Vaughan in the final. He repeated his success in the Grand Challenge Cup, and in the Silver Goblets in 1851 partnering James Aitken in the latter to beat John Erskine Clarke and C L Vaughan in the final. In 1852, he <b>stroked</b> <b>the</b> winning Oxford crew in the 1852 Boat Race. In 1853 he was in the Oxford four that won Stewards again and was playing cricket for I Zingari. For many years Chitty umpired the Boat Race.|$|E
25|$|A week later, Stevenage {{travelled}} to Essex to play Grays Athletic. The game ended 21 to Stevenage, {{despite the}} home side leading at the interval through a Jamie Guy strike. Stevenage {{turned it around}} in the second half, with goals from Michael Bostwick and Charlie Griffin. Stevenage followed this up with another away win four days later at Crawley Town; winning the match 30. Stevenage started brightly and scored within the first five minutes; Yemi Odubade latching onto David Bridges through ball to slot home. The visitors doubled their lead on the half hour mark, this time Tim Sills was the provider, as Odubade scored his second. Joel Byrom scored Stevenage's third in the second half, picking up the ball a yard inside the Crawley half and chipped Simon Rayner in goal. Stevenage then followed this up with an eighth consecutive victory, beating Oxford United 10 at Broadhall Way. The only goal of the game came seven minutes into the second half, David Bridges was fouled in the area by Chris Hargreaves; Scott Laird stepped up and subsequently scored to ensure the home side earned three points. Four days later, Stevenage lost 10 to Luton Town thanks to a Matthew Barnes-Homer goal in the second half. Stevenage bounced back just two days later on Easter Monday, with a 30 victory over AFC Wimbledon at Kingsmeadow. The away side {{took the lead in}} the ninth minute; Mark Roberts bundling home a Joel Byrom corner after Tim Sills had knocked the ball down. Just two minutes later, Stevenage doubled their lead, again Byrom was the provider, and his lofted ball was met on the half-volley by Lawrie Wilson, who lashed the ball home - making his first start since breaking his leg in August. Stevenage rounded off the victory in injury-time, substitute Eddie Odhiambo slotting the ball home from Charlie Griffin's cross. Stevenage then faced Forest Green Rovers at Broadhall Way five days later; the game ended 20 to Stevenage. The home side took the lead in the tenth minute; Tim Sills broke the offside trap and set up Joel Byrom to lash the ball home. Stevenage doubled their lead in the second half when substitute David Bridges was brought down in the area. Scott Laird calmly stepped up and <b>stroked</b> <b>the</b> ball into the net. A third win followed four days later, when Stevenage beat Altrincham 10 in a tight encounter at Moss Lane. Substitute Charlie Griffin scored the only goal of the game in the 83rd minute; Altrincham goalkeeper Russell Saunders fumbled the ball into the path of Griffin who placed his shot in-between the goalkeeper and the post to ensure a valuable three points to the visitors.|$|E

500|$|As a god, {{the player}} can teach their {{creature}} to perform {{tasks such as}} stocking the village store or performing miracles. The creature is taught what and when to eat, and how to attack or impress enemy villages. Fighting skills may be taught in one-on-one battles with other creatures; attack and defence abilities can be improved. Teaching is performed using a reinforcement learning system: if the creature does something the player does not want, it can be discourage with a slap. If the creature does something the player approves of, it can be <b>stroked.</b> <b>The</b> creature remembers the response to various actions and gradually changes its behaviour accordingly. With time and repetition, it can perform complex functions that allow it {{to serve as the}} player's avatar. Three types of leashes are used to command the creature to go to a specific place, and can be tied to a building to restrict movement. One leash encourages the creature to pay attention when actions are demonstrated; the others encourage either benevolent or malevolent behaviour. [...] The game reinforces the creature's choices and learning by providing visual feedback, and the creature has an alignment separate from the player's. Evil wolves sport glowing eyes and large fangs and claws; good ones turn a shade of purple and glow gently.|$|E
500|$|As a small child, Miller's major {{sporting}} aspiration {{was to be}} a jockey,>Mallett, p. 64. but {{he continued}} to play cricket and Australian football. At the age of 12, he played for an under-15 Victorian schoolboys cricket team that toured Queensland under the captaincy of future Test batsman Merv Harvey. At the time, Miller stood only [...] and wielded a sawn-off bat. His shots did not travel far, but he impressed observers with the manner in which he moved his feet and <b>stroked</b> <b>the</b> ball. Miller's small stature in a contact sport such as football forced him to rely on physical courage, something for which he became famed. However, his lack of height prompted him to turn to horseracing. Miller saw his first Melbourne Cup in 1926 at the age of seven and had been fascinated ever since. Caulfield Racecourse was only a short distance from the family home, and Miller spent many early mornings watching the trainers and jockeys go through their routines. He eventually persuaded his father to let him take horseriding lessons. Aside from being attracted to the racing culture, Miller felt that as he appeared destined to be a small person, he was {{more likely to have a}} successful career as a jockey than in cricket or football.|$|E

40|$|M. A. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to compile a psychological information program on stroke, and to provide this psychological information to the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient. <b>The</b> emotional status of the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient was evaluated during the intervention. The final goal {{of this research was}} to give a phenomenological description of the experiences of the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient. <b>The</b> method for collecting data was 1) to evaluate the emotional status of the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient with <b>the</b> POMS (Profile Of Mood State) inventory before he was exposed to the content of the psychological information program on <b>stroke.</b> 2) <b>The</b> spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient was then introduced to the psychological information program, and any questions which arose were answered. 3) A follow up appointment was arranged for ten days later. During this appointment the POMS inventory was administered again to assess the spouse's emotional status after exposure to the psychological informationprogram on stroke. Any further questions were answered. Within a framework of identified themes a phenomenological description of the experiences of the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient was given. The most important experiences were identified as confusion, anxiety, tension, rage, frustration, tiredness, and feelings of not being motivated and depression. The phenomenological themes were "Om-te-wees (Dasein) ", "Die wereld", "In-die-wereld-wees", "Om-ingegooi-tewees- in-die-wereld", "Angs as basiese ingesteldheid tot die wereld" and "Liggaamlikheid". The current research was motivated after a thorough study of <b>the</b> literature on <b>stroke.</b> <b>The</b> literature survey revealed a deficiency in terms of availability of information on <b>stroke</b> to <b>the</b> spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient after <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> has occured. <b>The</b> literature survey disclosed that the focus of research has been on <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient. Research identified the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient as <b>the</b> primary caretaker. Therefore {{it is important that the}} spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient will have access to psychological information on stroke to assist them during their tasks of caretaking. Certain variables influenced theresults of the present research project. These variables were 1) the time when the psychological information was provided to the subjects, 2) the emotional status after <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> had occurred, and 3) the extent of information the subjects received from other resources. During the current research project the subjects confirmed the value of the availability of psychological information on <b>stroke.</b> <b>The</b> psychological information on stroke is important in assisting the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient during their tasks of caret•king. The psychological information on <b>stroke</b> provides <b>the</b> spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient with 1) a better understanding of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient, 2) knowledge of what to expect after a stroke had occured, and 3) realistic goals for the future...|$|R
