In the United States, the rules governing these matters have diverged from the traditional rules applied internationally. The outcome of this process may require a court in one jurisdiction to apply the law of a different jurisdiction.|$|E
40|$|The substance-procedure {{dichotomy}} is {{a popular}} target of scholarly criticism because procedural <b>law</b> is inherently <b>substantive.</b> This article argues that <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> is also inherently procedural. I suggest that the construction of <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> entails assumptions about the procedures that will apply when that <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> is ultimately enforced. Those procedures are embedded in the <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> and, if not applied, will lead to over- or under-enforcement of the substantive mandate. Yet the substance-procedure dichotomy encourages us to treat procedural systems as essentially fungible-leading to a problem of mismatches between <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> and unanticipated procedures. I locate this argument about the procedural foundation of <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> within a broader discussion of the origin and status of the substanceprocedure dichotomy...|$|R

50|$|In most jurisdictions {{around the}} world, neither the <b>substantive</b> <b>laws</b> {{governing}} securities transactions nor {{the conflict of}} laws rules determining the law applicable to cross-border transactions have been updated adequately {{to deal with the}} indirect holding system.

Under traditional legal principles commingling fungible property terminates direct property rights of owners of the individual commingled items.|$|E

William Prosser noted this in 1966 and warned courts and scholars against confusing and merging the <b>substantive</b> <b>laws</b> of the two torts. In some states, his warning went unheeded and some courts and legislatures have created vague and ill-defined definitions to describe what constitutes a public nuisance.

50|$|Procedural fairness, if not {{all that}} {{originally}} was meant by due process of law, is at least what it most uncompromisingly requires. Procedural due process is more elemental and less flexible than substantive due process. It yields less to the times, varies less with conditions, and defers much less to legislative judgment. Insofar as it is technical law, {{it must be a}} specialized responsibility within the competence of the judiciary on which they do not bend before political branches of the Government, as they should on matters of policy which compromise substantive law.If it be conceded that in some way the agency could take the action it did, does it matter what the procedure is? Only the untaught layman or the charlatan lawyer can answer that procedure matters not. Procedural fairness and regularity are of the indispensable essence of liberty. Severe <b>substantive</b> <b>laws</b> can be endured if they are fairly and impartially applied. Indeed, if put to the choice, one might well prefer to live under Soviet substantive law applied in good faith by our common-law procedures, than under our substantive law enforced by Soviet procedural practices. Let it not be overlooked that due process of law is not for the sole benefit of an accused. It is the best insurance for the Government itself against those blunders which leave lasting stains on a system of justice but which are bound to occur on ex parte consideration.|$|E

5000|$|Nepal’s {{constitution}} specifically {{lists the}} right to equality and {{the right to}} freedom from exploitation. The right against exploitation specifically prohibits the trafficking of persons. Nepal's Muluki Ain is a [...] "comprehensive code relating to civil, criminals, as well as procedural and <b>substantive</b> <b>laws</b> of the kingdom" [...] (Center for Legal Research and Resource Development, 2002, p.11). A section of the Ain addresses trafficking specifically, and the following are prohibited: trafficking of human beings: an individual is not allowed to be removed from Nepal with the intent to sell; deprivation from legal guardian: someone who is below the age of 16 or mentally ill cannot be forcefully separated from their legal guardian; and slavery and bonded labor. Nepal also has three domestic laws in place that address girl trafficking and forced child labor, including the Labor Act of 1992, the Human Trafficking Control Act of Nepal of 1986, and the National Human Rights Commission Act of 1993. The Human Trafficking Control Act of Nepal of 1986 explicitly criminalizes the selling and buying of human beings and established provisions for rehabilitation and integration for victims. It defines human trafficking as anything that includes i) selling or buying of a person for any purpose; ii) forcing someone into prostitution with or without taking profit; iii) illegal dismembering of human organs and iv) engaging in prostitution. Those found guilty would be sentenced to up 20 years in prison. However, recruitment by deception for the purposes of bonded labor was not criminalized in this act unless it is for prostitution. The act is also criticized for equating sex trafficking with sex work, and for inadequate provisions for compensation and effective protection for plaintiffs who file cases against traffickers. Nepal has not adopted the international Palermo Protocol on Trafficking (2003) that offers the widely accepted working definition of trafficking as the use of force, coercion, and fraud to exploit a person for profit.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the largest}} groups of purported nonclients to whom lawyers might have {{obligations}} are members of bargaining units represented by unions. Despite the much publicized decline of labor unions, they have almost 16. 4 million members. In addition, many workers are members of bargaining units represented by labor unions, but are not union members. The relationship of union lawyers to these millions of bargaining unit members, whether members of the union or not, is unclear. An examination of how this relationship influences and is influenced by labor law offers a fascinating case study of the synergy between the <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> and the law and ethics of lawyering. The <b>substantive</b> labor <b>law,</b> which has legitimized representation of a union as an entity, both promotes collective action {{on the part of}} unions and protects the individual rights of bargaining unit members. The union 2 ̆ 7 s duty of fair representation calibrates these sometimes conflicting obligations. This case study suggests re-examination of the current practice of analyzing <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> and legal ethics as separate and unconnected fields. The current practice is to view <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> and legal ethics as intersecting circles, and to accept grudgingly that in the narrow area of intersection the <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> and the law of lawyering are the same. A model more consistent with this case study would view <b>substantive</b> <b>law</b> and legal ethics as 2 ̆ 2 warp and woof, 2 ̆ 2 as interlaced threads that together weave a whole tapestry...|$|R

40|$|Competition {{policy is}} {{made at the}} {{national}} level but {{a great deal of the}} business activity that it seeks to regulate takes place at the international level. Though it is universally accepted that some level of international cooperation is necessary to make regulation effective under these conditions, there is a considerable diversity of views on the question of how much cooperation is appropriate. The presence of international activity distorts competition policy in at least two ways. First, it causes the preferred domestic policies of states to diverge from what they would be in the absence of such activity. States that are net exporters of goods sold in imperfectly competitive markets have an incentive to weaken their antitrust rules and states that are net importers of such goods have reason to tighten theirs. Second, the choice of law rules adopted to establish the jurisdictional reach of domestic law create an additional divergence between the <b>substantive</b> <b>laws</b> actually chosen and those that would be chosen by a closed economy. States that choose to limit their laws to activities that take place within their territory are better off if they also weaken their <b>substantive</b> <b>laws.</b> States that extend the reach of their laws generate overlapping jurisdiction and force firms to run a gauntlet of legal rules that includes the strictest elements of each state’s laws, leading to a de facto regulatory standard that is stricter than that of any single state. This chapter explains why these problems cannot be resolved through the sort of low levels of cooperation that dominate current international antitrust efforts. Information sharing in particular cannot address the distortions to competition policy generated by cross-border business. Choice of law strategies can improve the regulatory framework, but can only partially address the problem and even this would require a dramatic change to existing policies. What is required, then, is a deeper form of cooperation on the subject of <b>substantive</b> <b>laws</b> or international standards. Though cooperation of this sort is difficult to achieve, there is no other way to address the policy distortions created when national authorities try to regulate international competition...|$|E
