40|$|The {{position}} of the magnetic center of the CESR Phase III super-conducting qudrupole magnet was determined using vibrating wire technique. The measurement was done at room temperature. The length of the magnet was 0 : 65 m and the maximum gradient was 3 : 96 10, 2 T=m. The magnetic center position was obtained with 9 m precision in vertical plane and with 17 m in horizontal. The techique allowed to detect less than 0 : 42 Gcm of the magnetic eld integral which appeared {{to be due to}} the misalignment between the quadrupole magnetic center and the thin <b>stratched</b> wire used as a probe. The measurement setup, instruments and the method is described...|$|R
