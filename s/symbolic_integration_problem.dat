Using a variable length linear genome {{to govern the}} mapping of a Backus Naur Form grammar definition to a program, expressions and programs of arbitrary complexity may be evolved.

In this paper we describe how we applied GE to a <b>Symbolic</b> <b>Integration</b> <b>problem,</b> that being finding a function which is an integral of Cos(X) + 2 X + 1. We also show how a Steady State selection mechanism was found to improve the performance of Grammatical Evolution. 1 Introduction Evolutionary Algorithms have been used with much success for the automatic generation of programs. In particular, Koza's [Koza 92] Genetic Programming has enjoyed considerable popularity and widespread use. While Koza originally employed Lisp as his target language many experimenters generate a home grown language peculiar to th [...] ...|$|E

40|$|When a {{computer}} algebra system has an assumption facility, {{it is possible}} to distinguish between <b>integration</b> <b>problems</b> with respect to a real variable, and those with respect to a complex variable. Here, a class of <b>integration</b> <b>problems</b> is defined in which the integrand consists of compositions of continuous functions and signum functions, and integration is with respect to a real variable. Algorithms are given for evaluating such integrals. 1 Introduction In recent years, `assume' or `declare' facilities have been implemented in most of the available computer algebra systems (CAS). As well, such facilities have been gaining wider acceptance within the user community. The presence of these facilities has altered the way CAS behave, and many established areas of symbolic computation need to be reconsidered.

40|$|Computation of {{elliptic}} integrals, whether numerical or symbolic, {{has been}} {{aided by the}} contributions of Italian mathematicians. Tricomi had {{a strong interest in}} iterative algorithms for computing elliptic integrals and other special functions, and his writings on elliptic functions and elliptic integrals have taught these subjects to many modern readers (including the author). The theory of elliptic integrals began with Fagnano`s duplication theorem, a generalization of which is now used iteratively for numerical computation in major software libraries. One of Lauricella`s multivariate hypergeometric functions has been found to contain all elliptic integrals as special cases and has led to the introduction of symmetric canonical forms. These forms provide major economies in new integral tables and offer a significant advantage also for <b>symbolic</b> <b>integration</b> of elliptic integrals. Although partly expository the present paper includes some new proofs and proposes a new procedure for <b>symbolic</b> <b>integration...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} as {{an introduction to}} the theory of <b>symbolic</b> <b>integration.</b> First a review of integral calculus is given. Then differential fields are presented as an algebraic framework for representing elementary functions and an algorithm for computing indefinite integrals of such functions is discussed in detail. Finally, a partial implementation of the algorithm is described, and in conclusion some remarks on the experiences gained by doing this work are given.

40|$|The paper {{concerns}} analytical {{integration of}} polynomial functions over linear polyhedra in three-dimensional space. To the authors' knowledge {{this is a}} first presentation of the analytical integration of monomials over a tetrahedral solid in 3 D space. A linear polyhedron can be obtained by decomposing it into a set of solid tetrahedrons, but the division of a linear polyhedral solid in 3 D space into tetrahedra sometimes presents difficulties of visualization and could easily lead to errors in nodal numbering, etc We have taken this into account and also the linearity property of integration to derive a <b>symbolic</b> <b>integration</b> formula for linear hexahedra in 3 D space. We have also used yet another fact that a hexahedron could be built up in two, and only two, distinct ways from five tetrahedral shaped elements These <b>symbolic</b> <b>integration</b> formulas are then followed by an illustrative numerical example for a rectangular prism element, which clearly verifies the formulas derived for the tetrahedron and hexahedron elements...|$|R
