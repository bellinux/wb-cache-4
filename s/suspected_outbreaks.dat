40|$|Whole-house {{surveillance}} for healthcare-associated {{infection is}} no longer the recommended practice because of the large personnel time investment required. We developed a computer-based tracking system using microbiologic data as an aid in detecting potential outbreaks of healthcare-associated infections on a hospital-wide basis. Monthly total isolates of 25 clinically significant hospital pathogens were tallied from 1991 to 1998 to form a database for future comparison. Two different algorithm tools (based on increases of organism numbers over baseline) were applied to determine alert thresholds for <b>suspected</b> <b>outbreaks</b> using this information. The first algorithm (2 SD) defined an alert as two standard deviations above the mean monthly number of isolates. The second (MI) defined an alert as either a 100 % increase from the baseline organism number over 2 months or a ≥ 50 % increase (compared to baseline) during a three-consecutive-month period. These two methods were compared to standard infection control professional surveillance (ICP) for the detection of clonal outbreaks over 12 months. Overall, a total of seven clonal outbreaks were detected during the 1 -year study. Using standard methods, ICP investigated nine <b>suspected</b> <b>outbreaks,</b> four of which were associated with clonal microbes. The 2 SD method signaled a suspected outbreak 15 times, of which three were clonal and ICP had detected one. The MI method signaled a suspected outbreak 30 times; four of these were clonal, and ICP had detected one. The sensitivity and specificity values for ICP, 2 SD, and MI for detecting clonal outbreaks were 57, 43, and 57 % and 17, 83, and 67 %, respectively.

30|$|In this study, we {{characterized}} NDV isolates {{that were}} obtained from <b>suspected</b> <b>outbreaks</b> of ND in small scale poultry farms and in wild pigeons between 2012 and 2014 in Ethiopia. In vivo analysis showed that all the isolates were virulent with ICPI ranging from 0.9 to 1.8. In addition, all the isolates contained multiple basic amino acids at the deduced cleavage site of fusion protein, which is a typical feature of virulent viruses. Virulent NDV is an APMV- 1 with an ICPI of 0.7 or higher or with at least three basic amino acids between positions 113 and 116 and phenylalanine at position 117 (Aldous and Alexander 2001). The present findings are in agreement with earlier reports that revealed the circulation of virulent NDVs in the village chickens in Ethiopia (Delesa et al. 2014; de Almeida et al. 2013; Chaka et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|Summary. Fifty-eight {{isolates}} of Clostridium dzficile {{from two}} distinct outbreaks were examined for inter-strain similarity by pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PMS).

40|$|Abstract. In April 2001, {{a second}} <b>suspected</b> <b>outbreak</b> of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the easternmost region of Indonesia was {{investigated}} in Merauke, a town located in the southeastern corner of Papua, by the Indonesian Ministry of Health and the U. S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 2. Principal case criteria of hemorrhagic disease provided for a study enrollment of 15 clinically acute and 37 convalescing subjects. Additionally, 32 comparable age/sex controls were selected from neighboring households. Laboratory diagnosis involved three testing methodologies: virus isolation by cell culture, a reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, and serologic assays. Antibody (IgM) to dengue virus was detected in 27 % of the acute clinical cases, 30 % of the convalescing cases, and only 3 % of the matched controls. Dengue 3 was the only viral serotype detected from acute serum samples by the RT-PCR. The mean ± SD age of the acute and convalescing cases was 7. 8 ± 5. 4 years. Overall hospital records accounted for 172 <b>suspected</b> <b>outbreak</b> cases, all urban residents of Merauke with no recent travel history outside the area. The estimated outbreak-associated case fatality rate among all suspected dengue cases was 1. 2 %.

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} China Infectious Disease Automated-alert and Response System (CIDARS) in China, and provide evidence {{for the improvement of}} the system. Methods The data of the automated alerts generated by the system, the responses to the alerts and alert confirmation were collected from 31 provinces in China in 2014. The analysis results were compared with the performance of the system during 2011 - 2013. Results A total of 386 578 alerts were generated nationwide on 33 infectious diseases, in which 383 637 (99. 24 %) were responded, and the median (P 25 -P 75) of time for response was 1. 0 (0. 4 - 3. 8) h. The overall response rate and the response rate in 24 hours in 2014 were higher than those during 2011 - 2013. Among all the alerts, 163 649 were generated by fixed-value detection method, in which 162 361 had responses (99. 21 %), and the median (P 25 -P 75) of time for response was 1. 0 (0. 2 - 5. 3) h. After the preliminary data verification, field investigation, and laboratory test, 80 923 alerts of disease cases were confirmed, accounting for 49. 50 % of the total alerts. In addition, 222 929 alerts were generated by the temporal aberration detection methods with an average 1. 48 alerts per county in a week, and 3159 <b>suspected</b> <b>outbreaks</b> were confirmed, accounting for 1. 42 % of the total alerts. The response rate was 99. 26 %, and the median (P 25 -P 75) of time for response was 1. 1 (0. 5 - 2. 9) h.

40|$|We use mathematically {{rigorous}} {{definitions of}} epidemiological concepts {{in order to}} derive a sequential combinatorial model of disease outbreak decomposition.

This allows us to differentiate between different disease spread scenarios with a level of sensitivity that previous models were unable to provide. This perspective leads us to propose a new practical definition for ‘outbreak’. In addition, we are able to use this model to understand, estimate, and, in some cases, correct for, the likely instances of reporting error inherent in disease surveillance. We demonstrate our model first with a hypothetical outbreak scenario and then in an analysis of <b>suspected</b> <b>outbreaks</b> of waterborne diseases in Massachusetts (MA) in 1995...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} temporal and spatial variations in the reporting of cases of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis to a passive surveillance system, and to assess the relationship of those variations to source of drinking water, adjusting for socioeconomic variables. METHODS: The authors analyzed temporal and spatial patterns for 4, 058 cases of giardiasis and 230 cases of cryptosporidiosis reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for 1993 - 1996. They linked each reported case to a database containing information on source of residential water supply and socioeconomic characteristics and evaluated the association between these factors and reporting rates using regression techniques. RESULTS: Reports of giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis were highest for the mixed unfiltered drinking water supply category. Reports of giardiasis were associated with income levels. Increases in reporting for both giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis were seen in summer to early fall. During a <b>suspected</b> <b>outbreak</b> of cryptosporidiosis n the city of Worcester in 1995, a significant increase in reported cases was also observed in the Boston metropolitan area. Following the <b>suspected</b> <b>outbreak,</b> weekly giardiasis rates increased slightly in Worcester and the Boston metropolitan area, while reporting of cryptosporidiosis increased dramatically. CONCLUSIONS: Consistently collected passive surveillance data have the potential to provide valuable information on the temporal variation of disease incidence as well as geographic factors. However, passive surveillance data, particularly in the initial period of surveillance, may be highly sensitive to patterns of diagnosis and reporting and should be interpreted with caution...|$|R
