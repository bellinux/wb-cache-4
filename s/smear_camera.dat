40|$|For {{the fast}} magnetie {{compression}} of a deuterium plasma, {{as described in}} another paper of this conference, (1), the compressionratio and end losses are of high interest. For the determination of these quantities the radial density distribution must {{be known as a}} function of time. Present theoretical calculations, concerned with the fast compression of plasma with parallel or reverse magnetic bias field are in need of experimental data, which also can be taken from density and intensity distributions. This information can partly be obtained from <b>smear</b> <b>camera</b> pictures. For this purpose the film density must be transformed into light intensity. The interpretation of the intensity distribution requires information on the composition of plasma radiation and on the dependence of the intensity on plasma density and temperature. In some cases the density distributions can be derived from the observed intensity...|$|E

In order to produce a low-cost camera, it is designed so that semiconductor memories forming discrete pixels act as an image memory, so that at least image-representing charge carriers can be moved from a memory subset to a read-out memory at a specific clock rate, so that, during the image clock period, permanently loaded semiconductor memories can be discharged...|$|R

The film is not entirely monochromatic, since computer-generated special effects add bright, acidic colours to tint golden coins, green bank notes, and red blood.|$|R
40|$|For {{long-range}} imaging or low {{signal-to-noise ratio}} environments sightline jitter {{is a primary}} source of image degradation. The conventional pointing 	&# 38; stabilization figure of merit is therefore the jitter RMS, with bearing friction often the largest contributor overall. Recent work has shown that pixel <b>smear</b> during <b>camera</b> integration can be reduced if adaptive friction compensation 'shapes' the jitter frequency content {{in addition to reducing}} the RMS value. This paper extends this work by automating the tuning process for the sightline control parameters by using a genetic algorithm. The GA fitness metric is the integral of the modulation transfer function due to any residual sightline jitter. It is shown that this fitness function is significantly better than the current root-mean-square figure of merit typically employed in stabilization loop design...|$|R
40|$|Airborne {{electro-optic}} systems require precise {{control of}} the camera line-of-sight vector to prevent unwanted and possibly mission-critical degradation of image quality. This is particularly true for long-range surveillance missions or operation in low signal-to-noise ratio environments. Recent work has shown that pixel <b>smear</b> during <b>camera</b> integration (jitter) can be reduced if adaptive friction compensation ‘shapes’ the jitter frequency content {{in addition to reducing}} the energy content. This article expands upon that work by automating the tuning process for the sightline control parameters using a genetic algorithm (GA) with a novel fitness function – the average modulation transfer function. The efficacy of this cost function is illustrated first through tuning of the traditional rate loop proportional þ integral controller gains and second via tuning of a bespoke adaptive friction compensator. It is shown in both cases that controllers tuned using the GA with this fitness function are significantly better than the current root-mean-square figure of merit typically employed in stabilization loop...|$|R
40|$|How far the eye reaches via {{camera is}} {{quantifiable}} and modeled with the TOD (triangle orientation discrimination) methodology (Bijl and Hogervorst, 2008 Perception 37 Supplement, this issue). For validation and extension purposes, we studied identification of real objects in several conditions. Objects (two-handheld) were recorded at various distances and angles with an under-sampled uncooled thermal imager. Results: (i) The distance for identification at threshold level was closely {{predicted by the}} TOD model, using existing scale criteria for two-handheld objects; (ii) effects of aspect angle were large, yet to nearly half extent predictable from contrast and size changes; (iii) sensor motion had no positive effect, (iv) the benefit of DSR (dynamic super resolution) was smaller than expected; (v) performance with local adaptive contrast enhancement equaled that of manual contrast optimization. The relatively poor performance with motion and DSR are probably due to motion <b>smear,</b> since <b>camera</b> speed was higher than in earlier studies. We conclude that the TOD methodology can predict identification distance for real targets. Effects of camera motion magnitude and smear are not modeled yet...|$|R
5000|$|Puppy Bowl is filmed {{inside a}} {{miniature}} Plexiglas [...] "stadium" [...] that is 19 ft long by 10 ft wide. Only puppies between 12 and 21 weeks old are {{allowed on the}} show, {{and there is a}} height and weight limit due to the size limitations of the play area. Puppies must show that they are well-socialized with people and other puppies, and that they have the full range of vaccinations. A wide variety of toys are placed inside the [...] "stadium". Although there is no minimum or maximum limit on how many toys may be in the stadium, show producers say that toys which make the loudest noise or which are sausage-shaped get the most attention. Toys are usually switched out every 20 minutes, and often more frequently. Peanut butter is <b>smeared</b> around <b>camera</b> lenses to induce the puppies to lick the camera. About 80 oz of peanut butter are used for the taping, along with 15 lb of dry dog food, 500 doggie treats, and 250 toys.|$|R
