Major League Baseball and CBS went with <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> {{unconventional}} scheduling during the LCS round, with two consecutive scheduled off-days in the NLCS after Game 2.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1860s semi-rural Stepney was the haunt of <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> {{colourful}} characters who operated around Adelaide’s parklands. The {{area around the}} Maid and Magpie Hotel {{was the scene of}} various robberies by the romantically named Captain Moonlight, {{not to be confused with}} the better known bushranger in New South Wales named Captain Moonlight. Stepney's highwayman, it later transpired, was armed with nothing more lethal than a camouflaged pipe-case and, after incarceration, became a respected member of society.|$|E
25|$|Holiday Camp – this {{building}} {{is known to}} have been erected on land owned by Allnatt Ltd since it is marked on the plans accompanying a combined conveyance/lease concluded by the railway with that company and is shown as measuring 12ft by 6ft. <b>Some</b> <b>rather</b> poor quality photographic evidence of the existence of this box also exists. There is uncertainty as to whether it was ever brought into use though and if so how many levers it contained.|$|E

25|$|We did <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> audacious things. We shot {{on top of}} a {{train in}} Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just so we could get the shots finished. We knew we couldn't be there long. All we had to do was do our legerdemain for five or ten minutes and be out of there. And we {{certainly}} couldn't pay for it.|$|E
25|$|Room 7 {{places the}} visitor in the 19th century with Gioachino Rossini, {{whose name is}} forever tied to Bologna. Portraits, busts, and libretti from the first {{recitals}} of Isabella Colbran, a singer and Rossini's first wife, can be found here. Also of interest is the original score of The Barber of Seville and <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> curious personal effects, like a dressing gown and a wig. Finally, one can behold Rossini's grand piano, which was constructed in 1844 by Camille Pleyel.|$|E
25|$|Gear {{ranges of}} almost 700% can be {{achieved}} on derailleur setups, though this may result in <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> large steps between gears or some awkward gear changes. However, through the careful choice of chainrings and rear cogsets, e.g. 3 chainrings 48-34-20 and a 10-speed cassette 11-32, one can achieve an extremely wide range of gears that are still well spaced. This sort of setup has proven useful on a multitude of bicycles such as cargo bikes, touring bikes and tandems. Even higher gear ranges {{can be achieved}} by using a 2-speed bottom bracket hub gear in conjunction with suitable derailleurs.|$|E

25|$|Rhodri Meilir (2005–09) portrays Alfie Butts. Alfie is {{a friend}} of Nick's who turned up at the Harper {{household}} at Christmas 2005. Alfie comes from a small community in Wales which, based on his stories, has <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> backwards traditions. Also, there weren't many girls where he came from, so he savors spending time at the Harpers' and meeting Michael's friends. Most of the family have turned to him at various times for advice. He's a struggling musician who is very laid-back about life despite not having a home or a steady income. He did not appear in the 2009 Christmas special and was completely absent from the whole of series 10 and 11, with no explanation.|$|E
25|$|The bath complex was {{partially}} cleaned of accumulated silt {{in the beginning}} of the 20th century. Despite continuous flooding, the hot springs section was in use in the 1950s. In 1992, the Roman Bridge that was also still in use was reconstructed with some distortions, disregarding the interests of conservationists. Also, in 1992, <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> shabby reconstruction work had been done in Allianoi itself, as a modern building was constructed over the historical remains. The complex was put out of use after heavy flooding in February 1998. Some of the site has been used as farmland. These recent elements were removed in 2003 by the excavation team and the major parts of the Bath Complex beneath them started to come to light.|$|E
25|$|According to Geoff Hurst's autobiography, England full back George Cohen overheard Ramsey {{talking to}} his {{coaching}} staff {{about the possibility of}} dropping Moore for the final and deploying the more battle-hardened Norman Hunter in his place. However, eventually they settled on keeping the captain in the team. Moore had not been playing badly, nor had he given the impression that he had been distracted by his contract dispute prior to the competition. The only possible explanations were that the Germans had <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> fast attacking players, which could expose Moore's own lack of pace, and that Hunter– who was of a similar age to Moore but only had four caps– was the club partner of Moore's co-defender with England, Jack Charlton.|$|E

25|$|Trick-or-treating {{typically}} happens between 5:30pm and 9:30pm on October 31, {{although some}} municipalities choose other dates. Homeowners wishing {{to participate in}} it sometimes decorate their private entrances with artificial spider webs, plastic skeletons and jack-o-lanterns. <b>Some</b> <b>rather</b> reluctant homeowners would simply leave the candy in bowls on the porch, others might be more participative and would even ask an effort from the children {{in order to provide}} them with candy. In more recent years, however, the practice has spread to almost any house within a neighbourhood being visited by children, including senior residences and condominiums. Although people decorate their homes for Halloween, when homes would like to participate in handing out candy, a porch light is usually left on to signify that a home is handing out candy.|$|E
25|$|During Harris’ {{life the}} book was neither popular nor well-received critically, fading into obscurity for many years before being rediscovered {{in the early years}} of the twentieth century. The book has since been republished many times, with a number of commentaries, <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> poorly researched, even {{reporting}} Harris’ first name as John. In more recent times a freshly researched volume by historian Eileen Hathaway has been published which removes many of the older mistakes and contains a foreword by the author Bernard Cornwell, who used the memoir as a source for his Sharpe series, even basing a minor character on Harris, albeit with a very different career. Likewise in the Sharpe TV series, the actor Jason Salkey played a rifleman very loosely based on Benjamin Harris. Salkey later recorded an audiobook version of The Recollections of Rifleman Harris.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} over Marsh's bowling action {{came to a}} head in the return match against Victoria at the SCG. The fixture had been slated for the Australia Day weekend but it was postponed by a week when Queen Victoria died. By the time the match was under way, public interest had started to wane. Some three decades later, J. C. Davis reflected on the match, noting that it stirred many memories, [...] "some fragrant and <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> unpleasant". The unsavoury incident that he alluded to was Crockett's continual no-balling of Marsh for throwing.|$|E

500|$|Kevin Cheung of The Sydney Morning Herald {{said the}} game [...] "loses out badly in the {{graphics}} department", commenting {{that on the}} [...] "tiny LCD screen the characters look like a garbled confusion of black pixels. It takes a healthy imagination to see the lasers bouncing off one's lightsabre. What's worse is that it's not always obvious where the exit passage is, which is frustrating after a slog through a tough level." [...] In addition, Tim Wapshott of The Times said that [...] "despite <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> good storyline screens, the graphics generally lack colour and the music is repetitive and tedious." ...|$|E
500|$|Speer {{was found}} guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, though he was acquitted on the other two counts. His claim that he was unaware of Nazi {{extermination}} plans, which probably saved him from hanging, was finally revealed to be false in a private correspondence written in 1971 and publicly disclosed in 2007. On 1 October 1946, he was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. While three of the eight judges (two Soviet and one American) initially advocated the death penalty for Speer, the other judges did not, and a compromise sentence was reached [...] "after two days' discussion and <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> bitter horse-trading".|$|E
500|$|The single's b-side, [...] "Thinkin' About You", {{is also a}} teen pop {{influenced}} song. The song {{is composed}} in the key of G major and is set in time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. Spears vocal range spans over two octaves from the low note of D3 to the high note G5 [...] Craig McDennis of The Hamilton Spectator said the lyrics of [...] "Thinkin' About You", along with [...] "Born to Make You Happy", [...] "verge on the sort of boy-worshipping dreck that even Tiffany would have sniffedat", while Jane Stevenson of Toronto Sun noted Spears [...] "puts <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> grownup heartfelt soul into [...] ".|$|E

500|$|Pinfold's adopted {{defensive}} persona, [...] "a {{combination of}} eccentric don and testy colonel", {{was the same}} that Waugh cultivated to keep the world at bay. Pinfold adheres to an outmoded form of Toryism, does not vote, and expresses outrageous views, part-facetiously. Pinfold was [...] "absurd to many but to <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> formidable". After Waugh's death, Nancy Mitford confirmed the essentially mocking nature of Waugh's persona: [...] "What nobody remembers about Evelyn is that everything with him was jokes. Everything". While Waugh's biographer Selena Hastings describes Pinfold as [...] "an accurate and revealing self-portrait", Stannard {{suggests that it is}} primarily an analysis of the adopted persona in which, like Pinfold, Waugh [...] "gives nothing away".|$|E
500|$|Lars Larson, {{the first}} {{interview}} subject, was infuriated after seeing the finished program. He had {{been led to believe}} that the episode would present a far more positive picture of American gay life. Larson, whose interview had been altered to make him seem less happy, filed a formal fraud complaint and withdrew his release. [...] "They had <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> nasty, angry anti-gay people on there who were treated as professionals," [...] he said. [...] "I had no problem with Harry Morgan or Mike Wallace because they were thorough. But obviously others in the decision-making process were truly upset with homosexuality. They saw it {{as a threat to the}} human race and were out to kill as best they could." [...] Jack Nichols was fired from his job as a hotel sales manager the day after the program aired.|$|E
500|$|After the WaveAid concert, {{from early}} 2005, Powderfinger had {{a period of}} hiatus. During the separation, most band members pursued other musical projects; on the {{personal}} front, Haug and Middleton each had children, and Fanning met his future wife. Middleton's side project, Drag, had issued an EP, Gas Food Lodging, in 2002. Zombos Reviews found the EP was [...] "full of well-written jangly pop, and has <b>some</b> <b>rather</b> nice ballads". Their debut album, The Way Out, recorded in March 2005 and released on 10 July, was [...] "a tad disappointing ... mostly mid-tempo pop-rock songs, mixed with some slower, pretty ballads. Everything's tastefully arranged, and there's always nice melodies and harmonies". Collins and Haug formed The Predators with Powderfinger's former drummer, Steven Bishop, now on drums and lead vocals. The group released a six-track EP, Pick Up the Pace, in July 2006 and undertook a short tour around Australia.|$|E
