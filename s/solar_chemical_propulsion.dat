40|$|NASA {{continues}} to advance plans to extend human presence beyond low-Earth orbit leading to human exploration of Mars. The plans being laid out follow an incremental path, beginning with initial flight tests followed by deployment of a Deep Space Gateway (DSG) in cislunar space. This Gateway, {{will serve as}} the initial transportation node for departing and returning Mars spacecraft. Human exploration of Mars represents the next leap for humankind because it will require leaving Earth on a long mission with very limited return, rescue, or resupply capabilities. Although Mars missions are long, approaches and technologies are desired which can reduce the time that the crew is away from Earth. This paper builds off past analyses of NASA's exploration strategy by providing more detail on the performance of alternative in-space transportation options with an emphasis on reducing total mission duration.

The DRA 5. 0 focused on nuclear thermal and cryogenic <b>chemical</b> <b>propulsion</b> system options for the mission. Follow-on work explored both nuclear and solar electric options. One enticing option that {{was found in a}} NASA Collaborative Modeling for Parametric Assessment of Space Systems (COMPASS) design study used a combination of a 1 -MW-class solar electric propulsion (SEP) system combined with storable chemical systems derived from the planned Orion crew vehicle. It was found that by using each propulsion system at the appropriate phase of the mission, the entire SEP stage and habitat could be placed into orbit with just two planned Space Launch System (SLS) heavy lift launch vehicles assuming the crew would meet up at the Earth-Moon (E-M) L 2 point on a separate heavy-lift launch. These appropriate phases use high-thrust <b>chemical</b> <b>propulsion</b> only in gravity wells when the vehicle is piloted and solar electric propulsion for every other phase. Thus the SEP system performs the spiral of the unmanned vehicle from low Earth orbit (LEO) to E-M L 2 where the vehicle meets up with the multi-purpose crew vehicle. From here SEP is used to place the vehicle on a trajectory to Mars. With SEP providing {{a large portion of the}} required capture and departure changes in velocity (delta V) at Mars, the delta V provided by the <b>chemical</b> <b>propulsion</b> is reduced by a factor of five from what would be needed with <b>chemical</b> <b>propulsion</b> alone at Mars.
