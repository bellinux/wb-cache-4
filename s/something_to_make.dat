25|$|Several months later, Graham joined WWE on a {{swing of}} nine {{televised}} events {{where he was}} interviewed by Jonathan Coachman (on December 28) before performing a skit which ended with Coachman getting knocked out. On February 25, 2005, Graham appeared at another live event and was again interviewed by Coachman before knocking him out. Three days later, Graham appeared on Raw, where he encouraged Randy Orton to do <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> himself notable. On October 3 at WWE Homecoming, Graham participated in a Legends Ceremony with 24 other WWE legends. On the January 23, 2006 episode of Raw, he promoted his book and DVD. Graham parted ways with WWE in 2009.|$|E
500|$|The {{team made}} two minor {{changes to the}} design: they removed Davros' {{microphone}} and completely redesigned Davros' headpiece. The team felt that the microphone was redundant because Davros did not [...] "speak in a whisper and need <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him more audible", and originally intended to leave Bleach's voice unaltered in post-production: the decision to treat the voice was not made until late May 2008; and Gorton thought the original headpiece [...] "always seemed particularly weak" [...] for [...] "such a powerful character". After he was informed that the production designer for Genesis of the Daleks wanted the headpiece to resemble a medical brace, Gorton redesigned it to appear to be [...] "screwed directly into [...] head".|$|E

500|$|... "Glorified G", a song mocking gun enthusiasts, was {{inspired}} by an incident that involved Abbruzzese telling the band he had just bought two guns, which sparked a conversation about guns within the band. [...] "W.M.A." [...] {{was inspired}} by an incident that happened outside Pearl Jam's rehearsal studio in which Vedder got into an altercation {{with a group of}} police officers who hassled a black friend of his but ignored him. Vedder said that [...] "Rearviewmirror" [...] is about being [...] "in a car, leaving... a bad situation." [...] Vedder stated that [...] "Rats" [...] is about the idea that [...] "rats are probably {{a hell of a lot}} more admirable" [...] than humans. [...] "Leash" [...] was written about the same girl that the Ten song [...] "Why Go" [...] is about. Regarding [...] "Indifference", Vedder said it is about [...] " [...] do <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some other peoples' lives better than they are, even if it means going through hell. Three Faces of Me." ...|$|E
500|$|Hardy himself {{admitted}} {{to his family}} that he was [...] "scared to death" [...] when he first arrived overseas, but believed that the soldiers were fed <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them brave, which he referred to as [...] "brave pills". After a short time in the military, he claimed {{that he was not}} afraid of anything that he experienced from then on. Even in the heat of battle, Hardy professed that he would get [...] "wound up" [...] at times, but never frightened. He recalled many strange experiences with food and drink, such as getting used to drinking green water from canteens and eating hardtacks, which he found to be surprisingly filling. To go with this, there was often little more than small tins of ham or chicken and occasionally coffee to drink and pudding or pie for dessert. Hardy also witnessed many of his friends get killed in action, and relied on his faith in God to get him through the toughest times.|$|E
500|$|The {{second story}} recounts {{the tale of}} the [...] "girl-bird" [...] Gertrude McFuzz, who has one small, plain tail feather and envies Lolla Lee Lou, who has two feathers. She goes to her uncle, Doctor Dake, for <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her tail grow. He tries to tell her that her tail is just right for her species, but she throws a tantrum. He gives in and he tells her where she can find berries that will make her tail grow. The first berry makes her tail exactly like Lolla Lee Lou's, but greed overtakes her. Now wanting to surpass Lolla Lee Lou, she eats the entire vine, causing her tail to grow to an {{enormous}} size. However, the added weight of too many feathers does not allow her to fly, run or even walk. She panics by yelping repeatedly, while being stuck on the hill. Her uncle, who hears her painful yelps, sends for the rescue, and many other birds are forced to carry her home and pluck out her tail feathers, which takes a few weeks, causing her to be sore. Though she has only one feather left—as before—she now has [...] "enough, because now she is smarter." ...|$|E

But when he winked, I realised nothing was going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it right. That's life. Nothing made sense but to stay alive - survive. Justice.

500|$|In {{military}} intelligence, the Russian doctrine roughly {{corresponds to}} Western notions of denial and deception. The United States Army's Glossary of Soviet Military Terminology from 1955 defined maskirovka as [...] "camouflage; concealment; disguise." [...] The International Dictionary of Intelligence from 1990 defined {{it as the}} Russian military intelligence (GRU) term for deception. Robert Pringle's 2006 Historical Dictionary of Russian and Soviet Intelligence defined it as strategic deception. Scott Gerwehr's The Art of Darkness summarized it as deception and operational security. The historian Tom Cubbage commented that military deception was enormously successful for the Soviets, and whatever the United States might think, for the Soviet Union it was <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> use of both in war and in peacetime. An article in The Moscow Times explained: [...] "But маскировка has a broader military meaning: strategic, operational, physical and tactical deception. Apparently in U.S. military terminology, this is called either CC (camouflage, concealment and deception) or more recently D (denial and deception). It is the whole shebang—from guys in ski masks or uniforms with no insignia, to undercover activities, to hidden weapons transfers, to—well, starting a civil war but pretending that you've done nothing of the sort." ...|$|E
500|$|Character {{designer}} Shigenori Soejima made Yu {{with the}} idea that his entire personality be decided and portrayed by the player's in-game actions and decisions. As a result, he wanted Yu to look more ambiguous than the protagonist of Persona 3. Soejima compared Yu to the Blue Ranger from the Power Rangers franchise as such character tends to stand silent to follow the orders from his leader. His character design stayed relatively similar to its initial conception, with his tone and facial expressions changing the most. The feature Soejima focused on most was his eyes: he thought that having his eyes under the fringe of his hair would make him [...] "look cool." [...] The collar of his school uniform was made to stand a bit taller than other characters'. While designing the character, Soejima noted [...] "the main character needs to be well-rounded enough to be likeable, but also needs that extra little <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him stand out {{from the rest of the}} cast." [...] He made a [...] "baby face" [...] sketch of the character so that he and the staff could discover Yu's [...] "special something" [...] and discuss what would make him stand out as the protagonist.|$|E
2500|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} sacramental {{confession}} requires three [...] "acts" [...] {{on the part}} of the penitent: contrition (sorrow of the soul for the sins committed), disclosure of the sins (the 'confession'), and satisfaction (the 'penance', i.e. doing <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> amends for the sins). The basic form of confession has not changed for centuries, although at one time confessions were made publicly.|$|E
500|$|Lichtenstein {{has also}} {{described}} {{the effect of}} depicting a single artificial brushstroke sculpturally with hundreds of small brushstrokes: [...] "My recent sculpture of a Brushstroke {{is an attempt to}} give strong form <b>to</b> <b>something</b> that is a momentary occurrence, <b>to</b> solidify <b>something</b> ephemeral, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it concrete." ...|$|R

2500|$|Doherty is a socialist, {{stating that}} [...] "I do have utopian fantasies. A {{lot of them}} are more - I wouldn't say spiritual, but they relate more to the {{imagination}} and the individual. But for me socialism is a way of trying to put far-fetched ideas into everyday use, {{trying to find a way}} to bridge the gap between that fantasy and reality, and reaching out across that gap to the people who can actually do <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the change." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the long}} {{production}} of Ashes of Time, Wong faced a two-month break {{as he waited}} for equipment to re-record sound for some scenes. He was in a negative state, feeling heavy pressure from his backers and worrying about another failure, and so decided to start a new project: [...] "I thought I should do <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> myself feel comfortable about making films again. So I made Chungking Express, which I made like a student film." [...] Conceived and completed within only six weeks, the new project ended up being released two months before Ashes of Time.|$|E
