5|$|These events led {{rapidly to}} Mary's defeat and {{imprisonment}} in Loch Leven Castle. The Scottish lords {{forced her to}} abdicate in favour of her son James, who {{had been born in}} June 1566. James was taken to Stirling Castle to be raised as a Protestant. Mary escaped from Loch Leven in 1568 but after another defeat fled across the border into England, where <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been assured of support from Elizabeth. Elizabeth's first instinct was to restore her fellow monarch; but she and her council instead chose to play safe. Rather than risk returning Mary to Scotland with an English army or sending her to France and the Catholic enemies of England, they detained her in England, where she was imprisoned for the next nineteen years.|$|E

With her pornographic video past a decade away, Iijima was so well known as a {{mainstream}} TV celebrity that many younger members of her audience were unaware that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> {{been one of the}} top AV actresses. Items from her early career began going for high prices, and an unauthorized 2002 box-set release of her adult videos sold very well, until her lawyers took it off the market.|$|E
25|$|After Tassoni and Angelica depart, the horrified Concetta sees Tancredi in {{a radically}} {{different}} light. What <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> believed was a vulgar attempt to seduce Angelica was really a momentary lapse of judgment. Tancredi loved only her and never ceased to regret marrying Angelica. She also realizes that Tancredi's attempt to enter the convent was in reality a subtle marriage proposal directed to her. After fifty years, Concetta is at last stripped of the comfort of blaming her father and cousin for her own mistakes.|$|E

25|$|After the French Revolution of 1789, Catherine {{rejected}} many {{principles of}} the Enlightenment <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> viewed favourably. Afraid the May Constitution of Poland (1791) {{might lead to a}} resurgence {{in the power of the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the growing democratic movements inside the Commonwealth might become a threat to the European monarchies, Catherine decided to intervene in Poland. She provided support to a Polish antireform group known as the Targowica Confederation. After defeating Polish loyalist forces in the Polish–Russian War of 1792 and in the Kościuszko Uprising (1794), Russia completed the partitioning of Poland, dividing all of the remaining Commonwealth territory with Prussia and Austria (1795).|$|E

On Sept. 9, 1977, Maddux returned to the apartment <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> shared with Einhorn to collect her things (Einhorn had reportedly threatened to throw her things {{out into the street}} as trash), and was never seen again.

25|$|However, an {{increasing}} number of reports circulated about friction in the marriage, with speculation that this may have been due to Alice's making do with less money than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been accustomed to. It was said that she was strongly interested in fame and fortune, and when household finances dwindled, she complained bitterly. Bunten wrote in her Life of Alice Barnham that, upon their descent into debt, she went on trips to ask for financial favours and assistance from their circle of friends. Bacon disinherited her upon discovering her secret romantic relationship with Sir John Underhill. He subsequently rewrote his will, which had previously been very generousleaving her lands, goods, and incomeand instead revoked it all.|$|E
25|$|Truth had a life-changing {{religious}} experience during her {{stay with the}} Van Wagenens, and became a devout Christian.

While in New York, she befriended Mary Simpson, a grocer on John Street who claimed <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been enslaved by George Washington.

In 1832, she met Robert Matthews, also known as Prophet Matthias, and went to work for him as a housekeeper at the Matthias Kingdom communal colony. Elijah Pierson died, and Robert Matthews and Truth were accused of stealing from and poisoning him. Both were acquitted of the murder, though Matthews was convicted of lesser crimes, served time, and moved west.|$|E
25|$|Months later, {{after the}} {{forensic}} testing had been inconclusive, FBI agent Ron Butkiewicz {{read the newspaper}} story, contacted O'Malley, and they toured the location together on April 6, 1992. Upon re-interviewing Lodzinski's friends and family, Butkiewitz learned that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> worked and taken frequent walks at the Raritan Center complex, within a few blocks of the sneaker's discovery, although Lodzinski herself omitted just this location when investigators had asked for her complete employment history. On April 23–24, 1992, law enforcement teams conducted a full search of the area. They quickly located a matching second sneaker in Timmy's size, and then found the boy's partial skeletal remains in and around a truck tire in Red Root Creek, near pieces of his clothing, a Ninja Turtles balloon, and a blue blanket. His identity was confirmed through dental records, and his death was ruled a homicide, although the time, location, and medical cause of death could not be determined due to advanced decomposition.|$|E

Every available space of sitting and standing room was crowded". She starts off her speech by giving a little background about her own life. Sojourner recounts how her mother told her to pray to God {{that she may have}} good masters and mistresses. She goes on to retell how her masters were not good to her, about how she was whipped for not understanding English, and how she would question God why he had not made her masters be good to her. Sojourner admits to the audience that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> hated white people, but she says once she met her final master, Jesus, she was filled with love for everyone. Once enslaved folks were emancipated, she tells the crowd she knew her prayers had been answered.|$|E
25|$|Bernhardt {{repaired}} her old {{relationships with}} {{the other members of}} the Comédie Française; she participated in a benefit for Madame Nathalie, the actress <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> slapped. However, she was frequently in conflict with Perrin, the director of the theater. In 1878, during the Paris Universal Exposition, she took a flight over Paris with balloonist Pierre Giffard and painter George Clairin, in a balloon decorated with the name of her current hit, Dona Sol. An unexpected storm carried the balloon far outside of Paris to a small town. When she returned by train to the city, Perrin was furious; he fined Bernhardt a thousand francs, citing a theater rule which required actors to request permission before they left Paris. Bernhardt refused to pay, and threatened to resign from the Comédie. Perrin recognized that he could not afford to let her go. Perrin and the Minister of Fine Arts arranged a compromise; she withdrew her resignation, and in return was raised to a societaire, the highest rank of the theater.|$|E
