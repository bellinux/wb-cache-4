5|$|At {{the end of}} the invasion, the pro-Saddam {{forces in}} Anbar–the Ba'ath Party, the Republican Guard, the Fedayeen <b>Saddam,</b> <b>and</b> the Iraqi Intelligence Service–remained intact. Saddam hid in Ramadi and Hīt in early April. Other pro-Saddam forces were able to {{relocate}} from Anbar to Syria with money and weapons, where they set up headquarters. The nucleus of the insurgency in its first few months was formed from the pro-Saddam forces in Anbar and Syria. In contrast to the looting throughout Baghdad {{and other parts of the}} country, Ba'athist headquarters and homes of high-ranking Sunni leaders were relatively untouched. The head of Iraqi ground forces in the province, General Mohammed Jarawi, formally surrendered to elements of the 3rd Infantry Division at Ramadi on 15 April 2003.|$|E

25|$|The {{first trial}} began before the Iraqi Special Tribunal on 19 October 2005. At this trial <b>Saddam</b> <b>and</b> seven other {{defendants}} were tried for {{crimes against humanity}} with regard to events that took place after a failed assassination attempt in Dujail in 1982 {{by members of the}} Islamic Dawa Party (see also human rights abuses in Iraq under Saddam Hussein).

25|$|There {{had also}} been bitter enmity between <b>Saddam</b> <b>and</b> Khomeini since the 1970s. Khomeini, having been exiled from Iran in 1964, took up {{residence}} in Iraq, at the Shi'ite holy city of An Najaf. There he involved himself with Iraqi Shi'ites and developed a strong, worldwide religious and political following against the Iranian Government, which Saddam tolerated. However, when Khomeini began to urge the Shi'ites there to overthrow <b>Saddam</b> <b>and</b> {{under pressure from the}} Shah, who had agreed to a rapprochement between Iraq and Iran in 1975, Saddam agreed to expel Khomeini in 1978 to France. However {{this turned out to be}} an imminent failure and a political catalyst, for Khomeini had access to more media connections and also collaborated with a much larger Iranian community under his support which he used to his advantage.|$|E
25|$|On 17 June 2005, former Malaysian prime {{minister}} Mahathir Mohamad, former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark, former minister of Foreign Affairs of France Roland Dumas and former President of Algeria Ahmed Ben Bella announced the formation, under their joint chairmanship, {{of an international}} Emergency Committee for Iraq, with a main objective of ensuring fair trials for <b>Saddam</b> <b>and</b> the other former Ba'ath Party officials being tried with him.|$|E
25|$|Three {{weeks into}} the invasion, U.S.-led Coalition forces moved into Baghdad. Units of the Iraqi Special Republican Guard led the defence of the city. The rest of the {{defenders}} were a mixture of Republican Guard units, regular army units, Fedayeen <b>Saddam,</b> <b>and</b> non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. Initial plans were for Coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in, forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city, and then attack with air and artillery forces.|$|E

25|$|SAD teams also {{conducted}} missions {{behind enemy lines}} to identify leadership targets. These missions led to the initial air strikes against <b>Saddam</b> <b>and</b> his generals. Although the strike against Saddam was unsuccessful in killing him, it effectively ended his ability to command and control his forces. Strikes against Iraq's generals were more successful and significantly degraded the Iraqi command's ability to react to, and maneuver against, the U.S.-led invasion force. SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi Army officers into surrendering their units once the fighting started.|$|E
25|$|In March 2003, the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Australia, Spain, Denmark, and Italy began {{preparing}} for the invasion of Iraq, {{with a host of}} public relations and military moves. In his 17 March 2003 address to the nation, Bush demanded that <b>Saddam</b> <b>and</b> his two sons, Uday and Qusay, surrender and leave Iraq, giving them a 48-hour deadline. But the U.S. began the bombing of Iraq on the day before the deadline expired. On 18 March 2003, the bombing of Iraq by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Poland, Spain, Italy and Denmark began. Unlike the first Gulf War, this war had no explicit UN authorisation.|$|E
25|$|Iraqi {{authorities}} put <b>Saddam</b> <b>and</b> {{seven other}} former Iraqi officials on trial on 19 October 2005, {{four days after}} the 15 October 2005 referendum on the new Iraq constitution. The tribunal specifically charged the defendants with the killing of 148 Shiites from Dujail, in retaliation for the failed assassination attempt of 8 July 1982. Supporters of Saddam protested against the trial in Tikrit. After the charges were read to them, all eight defendants pleaded not guilty. While initially open to the public, the trial was closed to them on 15 March 2006, after Saddam began making political statements on the stand and an argument began between him and the presiding judge.|$|E

25|$|In 1968, Saddam {{participated in}} a bloodless coup led by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr that overthrew Abdul Rahman Arif. <b>Saddam</b> <b>and</b> Salah Omar al-Ali {{contacted}} Ba'athists {{in the military and}} helped lead them on the ground. Arif was given refuge in London and then Istanbul. Al-Bakr was named president and Saddam was named his deputy, and deputy chairman of the Ba'athist Revolutionary Command Council. According to biographers, Saddam never forgot the tensions within the first Ba'athist government, which formed the basis for his measures to promote Ba'ath party unity as well as his resolve to maintain power and programs to ensure social stability. Although Saddam was al-Bakr's deputy, he was a strong behind-the-scenes party politician. Al-Bakr was the older and more prestigious of the two, but by 1969 Saddam clearly had become the moving force behind the party.|$|E
25|$|Uday Hussein (18 June 1964 – 22 July 2003), was Saddam's oldest son, {{who ran the}} Iraqi Football Association, Fedayeen <b>Saddam,</b> <b>and</b> several media {{corporations}} in Iraq including Iraqi TV and the newspaper Babel. Uday, while originally Saddam's favorite son and raised to succeed him he eventually fell out of favour with his father due to his erratic behavior; {{he was responsible for}} many car crashes and rapes around Baghdad, constant feuds with other members of his family, and killing his father's favorite valet and food taster Kamel Hana Gegeo at a party in Egypt honoring Egyptian first lady Suzanne Mubarak. He became well known in the west for his involvement in looting Kuwait during the Gulf War, allegedly taking {{millions of dollars worth of}} gold, cars, and medical supplies (which were in short supply at the time) for himself and close supporters. He was widely known for his paranoia and his obsession with torturing people who disappointed him in any way, which included tardy girlfriends, friends who disagreed with him and, most notoriously, Iraqi athletes who performed poorly. He was briefly married to Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri's daughter, but later divorced her. The couple had no children.|$|E
500|$|Following the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, American intelligence agencies reported that aides of Saddam Hussein managed to acquire Belarusian passports while in Syria, {{but that it}} was unlikely that Belarus would offer a safe haven for <b>Saddam</b> <b>and</b> his two sons. This action, along with arms deals with Iraq and Iran, prompted Western governments to take a tougher stance against Lukashenko. The US was particularly angered by the arms sales, and American political leaders increasingly began to refer to Belarus as [...] "Europe's last dictatorship". The EU was concerned for the security of its gas supplies from Russia, which are piped through Belarus, and took an active interest in Belarusian affairs. With the accession of Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, the EU's border with Belarus has grown to more than 1000kilometers.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{begins with}} an {{announcement}} that viewers have waited for weeks for {{the answer to the}} mystery [...] "Who Is Cartman's Father", but then points out that the answer will not be revealed in this episode; instead, there is a presentation of Not Without My Anus starring Terrance and Phillip. A caption wishes the viewers a happy April Fools' Day. The drama itself opens in a courtroom in Canada, with Terrance on trial for the murder of a local doctor; Phillip is his lawyer while Terrance and Phillip's sworn nemesis, Scott, who has had a long hatred of the duo's toilet humour, is acting as the prosecutor. Scott uses a group of seemingly airtight exhibits to prove Terrance's guilt, while Terrance's defense consists of nothing but a long string of fart jokes. Ultimately, the jury returns a verdict of not guilty. Angered, Scott promises vengeance. He is ultimately approached by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, proposing a deal: Saddam would assist in getting Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, in exchange for Scott assisting <b>Saddam</b> <b>and</b> his Iraqi associates into Canada. Scott is apprehensive about trusting Saddam, but agrees to the deal. The pair then conspires to kidnap Sally, daughter of Terrance and Celine Dion, and hold her hostage, as bait to lure Terrance and Phillip to Tehran; Saddam's soldiers would then murder Terrance and Phillip on arrival.|$|E
500|$|Terrance and Phillip {{become aware}} of the {{kidnapping}} when they receive a letter, but they immediately locate Sally upon arrival in Tehran. The duo return Sally to her home, where Saddam has now taken control. Celine, Terrance's now ex-wife, is dating, and has become pregnant by a friend of the duo named Ugly Bob. While the couple discuss their relationship, Saddam interrupts and takes them hostage, with Celine having planned to sing at a Canadian football game. Scott has also become worried about the presence of the Iraqi soldiers in Canada, but becomes infuriated when he finds that Terrance and Phillip have returned to Canada safely. He confronts Saddam about the double-cross, but Saddam's armed guards scare him into backing away. It is revealed that Saddam is trying to take over Canada as {{the first step in a}} plan for world domination. Terrance and Phillip arrive at the game. Instead of following a plan set up by Scott to commit suicide by using a bomb, they come up with a new plan and put on gas masks. With brute force, everyone farts a huge gas cloud which kills <b>Saddam</b> <b>and</b> his soldiers. Scott arrives, and is annoyed to find that Terrance and Phillip are still alive. Terrance, Phillip, Celine, and everyone else (excluding Scott) celebrate their freedom with a rendition of [...] "O Canada". During the credits, an announcement is made that the solution to who Cartman's father is would be answered [...] "in a few weeks".|$|E

2500|$|In Iraq, {{the country}} in which the war would take place, protesters marched down Palestine Street in Baghdad where several {{thousand}} Iraqis—many carrying Kalashnikov rifles—joined in the global protests.
