500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{commented that}} [...] "it's a little {{surprising}} that the just-released clip for Beyoncé's 'Video Phone' has nary a flame or fish-eye shot (there are, of course, plenty of outlandish costumes). However, don't {{make the mistake of}} thinking this video is by any means straightforward— it's plenty WTF! [...] It's definitely not the Gaga we're used to seeing, but her appearance isn't exactly run-of-the-mill, either. And neither is this video, for that matter.

[...] Jocelyn Vena of the same publication noted, [...] "The clip is charged with energy, and the cynics out there might wonder if putting two sizzling divas in a room together created any kind of rivalry." [...] Jim Farber from New York's Daily News compared Knowles' look to that of pin-up model Bettie Page, and said [...] "The clip for 'Video Phone' [...] doesn't offer {{much in the way of}} chemistry or even interaction between the two divas. [...] clip seems about as innovative as a rotary dial up." [...] Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone commented that the video was an [...] "almost seizure-inducing parade of cinematic homages and wardrobe changes." [...] He also compared Knowles' look to Page, as well as Katy Perry and rapper M.I.A. The Daily Mail gave a positive review of the video, calling it avant-garde and naughty.|$|E
