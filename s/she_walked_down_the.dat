2500|$|Grandin {{attended}} Beaver Country Day School from 7th to 9th grade. She {{was expelled}} {{at the age}} of 14 for throwing a book at a schoolmate who had taunted her. Grandin has described herself as the [...] "nerdy kid" [...] whom everyone ridiculed. She has described occasions when <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hallways and her fellow students would taunt her by saying [...] "tape recorder" [...] because of her habit of repetitive speech. Grandin states, [...] "I could laugh about it now, but back then it really hurt." ...|$|E
2500|$|All of {{the songs}} on Frames were either written or co-written by DeWyze. He wrote around twenty songs and then {{selected}} thirteen to include on the album. Drew Pearson co-wrote [...] "Silver Lining", [...] "Fight" [...] and [...] "Like I Do" [...] with DeWyze. [...] "Like I Do" [...] {{was inspired by a}} friend of DeWyze's, who went through a similar situation. [...] "Who Would've Known" [...] was written for DeWyze's wife, Jonna Walsh, whom he married in July 2012. The song was played as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle at their wedding, and DeWyze also performed it himself during the reception. Walsh served as the inspiration for the song [...] "Breathing In" [...] as well, which DeWyze said is about how she is the anchor in his life and is able to bring him back to earth. Describing [...] "Don't Be Afraid" [...] as an [...] "internal monologue", DeWyze has called {{it one of the most}} personal songs that he has ever written. Although he generally does not like to release songs about himself and originally did not plan on having this one on the album, he was swayed by his manager, who overheard him working on it in the studio. Acoustic versions of all thirteen songs were recorded and included on the deluxe edition of the album.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more they}} were alone. Lady Ruth rose slowly {{to her feet}} and, {{trembling}} in every limb, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> room and fell on her knees before Wingrave.|$|E
50|$|Jonathan {{calls the}} police, and Andrew, taking {{the blame for}} his wife, is arrested. Celia's body is found in a river, and after the funeral, Paul burns the den and reconciles with Jackie. The film closes with a {{flashback}} to the last time Paul saw Celia; they openly talk about being siblings, and they say goodbye as <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road to her untimely death.|$|R
60|$|Nelly's social ostracism did {{not affect}} her appetite. But after lunch was over, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> skiff. Winslow {{followed}} her.|$|R
50|$|If the {{favourite}} girl {{is not one}} of the two finalists, <b>she</b> will <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> catwalk to a swing beat.|$|R
60|$|She {{kept him}} waiting barely five minutes. She {{was still wearing}} her smart {{traveling}} suit and the little toque which she had worn when she left home. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street with him, humming gayly.|$|E
60|$|She {{glanced back}} at him as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> path to the roadway. He was still {{standing}} where she had left him, his feet slightly apart, {{his hands in the}} pockets of his riding breeches, looking after her.|$|E
60|$|Mr Golding {{looked at}} her stupidly, not {{understanding}} her agitation. But they had reached the church. Miss Reed stopped in the porch to wipe her boots and pass an arranging hand over her hair. Then, gathering herself together, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle to her pew.|$|E
50|$|The main {{ritual is}} {{performed}} next. The {{lady of the}} house presents a boiled egg and smoked fish which the participants accept with both hands. A woman helper follows pouring rice wine from a jar into little bowls. After everyone has been served, <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> line again pouring wine three times into each bowl. She serves wine a third time after which the participants can set <b>down</b> <b>the</b> bowls.|$|R
60|$|A {{little later}} <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> by <b>the</b> {{side of the}} little park and on westward to Broadway to {{accomplish}} a little shopping.|$|R
5000|$|... "In {{the midst}} of summer, <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> eighty steps. Counting them out loud one after the other, even though she knows very well their number. It is cloudy, almost dark, {{even though it is}} only July. The bright nights are waning. The scents of roses and honeysuckles waft around her. She stops, enthralled by the silence and beauty of the summer night. The noise from the day's bustle still lingers in her ears." [...] From The King's Roses ...|$|R
60|$|Mademoiselle Idiale, {{with the}} aid of one of the two maids who were {{traveling}} with her, was able to make a sufficiently effective toilette. At a few minutes before the time for luncheon, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> corridor and recognized Von Behrling, who was sitting with his companions in one of the compartments.|$|E
6000|$|... "Farewell--sweetheart!" [...] he answered, hesitating for {{a moment}} over the words which seemed so strange to him. Then, as though loth to leave him, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hall by his side, and they looked out {{for a moment}} into the square. A footman was {{standing}} prepared to open the door, but Helen sent him away with a message to her maid.|$|E
60|$|She {{seemed almost}} startled, {{for a moment}} unresponsive. Such a speech was so unlike him that it seemed {{impossible}} {{that he could be}} in earnest. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stairs by his side with a new gravity in her face. Perhaps he noticed it. At any rate, {{as soon as they were}} seated in the car he began to talk to her.|$|E
50|$|At this point, {{the girls}} are all looking for Manuela and cannot find her. Manuela has climbed up the main {{staircase}} and is ready to jump. Manuela is saved by the other students. The headmistress and Fräulein von Bernburg walk out of Fräulein von Bernburg's room to discover a commotion and are then told that Manuela tried to jump and kill herself. The movie ends with all the girls watching <b>the</b> headmistress as <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stairwell and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hall in silence.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Ah-jung (Chen Chao-jung) is {{drinking}} coffee at a cafe when a beautiful real estate agent, May Lin (Yang Kuei-Mei), {{sits at the}} table next to his. Intrigued, he follows her as <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street. Lin catches on and eventually joins him. She leads him to a vacant apartment that she is trying to sell — the same apartment that Hsiao-kang is staying in — and they have sex in one of the bedrooms. Hsiao-kang hears them and stops the bleeding from his wrists.|$|R
50|$|Parodies of {{the film}} abound. The 1937 Laurel and Hardy comedy Way Out West parodied the famous hitchhiking scene, with Stan Laurel {{managing}} to stop a stage coach using the same technique. Mel Brooks's film Spaceballs (1987) parodies the wedding scene. As <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle to wed Prince Valium, Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga) is told by her father, King Roland, that Lone Starr forsook the reward for the princess's return and only asked to be reimbursed {{for the cost of}} the trip.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no--no gentleman!" [...] exclaims {{the little}} widow; [...] "let us go down, if you like, son, and pay our respects to this one. Will you please {{to give me}} your arm?" [...] And taking an arm which was very little able to give her support, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> broad stairs, and into the {{apartment}} where the Colonel sate.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, thank you, Aunt Jane!' cried Gillian, {{the colour}} rising in her face, {{and she was}} the willing bearer of the basket as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> steps with her aunt, and along the esplanade, only pausing to review the notices of palatial, rural, and {{desirable}} villas in the house-agent's window, and to consider in what proportion their claims to perfection might be reduced.|$|E
60|$|These welcome {{sights and}} sounds met Christie, as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> lane, and, coming to a gate, paused there to look about her. An old-fashioned cottage stood {{in the midst of}} a garden just {{awakening}} from its winter sleep. One elm hung protectingly over the low roof, sunshine lay warmly on it, and at every window flowers' bright faces smiled at the passer-by invitingly.|$|E
50|$|In the end, during Aschenputtel's wedding, as <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle {{with her}} stepsisters as her bridesmaids, (they {{had hoped to}} worm their way into her favour), <b>the</b> doves fly <b>down</b> and strike <b>the</b> two stepsisters' eyes, one in {{the left and the}} other in the right. When the wedding comes to an end, and Aschenputtel and her prince march out of the church, the doves fly again, {{striking}} the remaining eyes of the two evil sisters blind, a punishment they had to endure {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|R
50|$|Morning approaches, and <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> highway {{with the}} driver of the truck {{approaching}} her at a rapid speed. After some fumbling, she is able to strike a match and light her Molotov cocktail. She hurls the bottle at the truck and almost instantly it is consumed by flames, followed by a large explosion. After a few moments, the camera view changes to behind Nicole. She starts to run away, but as soon as she turned, a man looking very much like Jess is right there, and she and everything then fades to black.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Crush" [...] {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Chris Applebaum and edited by Nabil Mechi. On September 10, 2001, it became Moore's first video to reach the number-one spot on MTV's countdown show Total Request Live. In the video, Moore sits in her crush's room and tries to wake him up. She performs with her band in another room. The video ends with Moore wearing {{a replica of the}} jacket Michael Jackson wears in the [...] "Thriller" [...] music video. When <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hall, <b>she</b> sees her crush and smiles.|$|R
6000|$|Again Miss Helstone {{returned}} thanks. She {{thought what}} a kind heart was hidden under her visitor's seeming chilliness. Observing that Mrs. Pryor again glanced {{with an air}} of interest towards the portraits, as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> room, Caroline casually explained: [...] "The likeness that hangs near the window, you will see, is my uncle, taken twenty years ago; the other, {{to the left of the}} mantelpiece, is his brother James, my father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As you please, as you please," [...] {{said the}} doctor, {{wondering}} why {{she wanted a}} day in Paris; {{but it could have}} nothing to do with his sick man. He left the room, promising to see the Dane again in an hour or two, and took up a position at the garden gate through which the nurse must pass. In about half an hour <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> path carrying her box. The doctor opened the gate for her.|$|E
60|$|The {{snow was}} gone, high winds had dried the walk, {{and a clear}} sky {{overhead}} made one forget sodden turf and chilly air. March was going out like a lamb, and Christie enjoyed an occasional vernal whiff from far-off fields and wakening woods, as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> broad mall watching the buds on the boughs, {{and listening to the}} twitter of the sparrows, evidently discussing the passers-by as they sat at the doors of their little mansions.|$|E
50|$|Harry and Kurt {{suddenly}} show up. Harry, in {{his capacity}} as landlord, voices displeasure with the torn up house. They corner Tom with the intention of killing him, but Maggie interrupts them when she arrives back home. As Harry takes her hostage, Frank emerges from the basement and fatally shoots both Kurt and Harry to save Tom and Maggie. Tom notices Samantha's spirit put on her glasses and coat, she smiles as <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road and slowly fades away, suggesting her soul is finally at peace and is now free to fully move on.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} for Cement was {{directed}} by Jon Klien and is set almost entirely in a grimy, dimly-lit bedroom set with windows similar to those seen in the Death Star in the Star Wars films. It flashes between band performance and frontman Grant Nicholas indulging in various unhinged, obsessive activities relating to his love interest in the video which loosely relate to the song's lyrics. This includes spying on the girl with a camera as <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street and constructing a model of her, which (in his mind at least) comes to life, and hand-peeling the shell off an egg.|$|R
50|$|The music video, {{which was}} {{directed}} by Chris Hicky, made its premiere during CMT's Big New Music Weekend on October 2, 2009. The video is set at Lambert's wedding; as <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle, <b>she</b> passes numerous women all of which her groom has cheated on her with. When she reaches the altar, she announces {{that she had been}} lying too, and runs off with the best man (Greg Sestero). The video features a cameo appearance of Jamey Johnson as the preacher. Lambert's parents and band members were among the wedding guests, and Lambert's long-time friend, Lacey, was the maid of honor.|$|R
60|$|Every one in {{the army}} soon came to hear of the exploit of Molly Pitcher, {{and it was not}} long before she was called Captain Molly. The {{officers}} of the French regiment on the American side were particularly pleased with this act of heroism in a woman, and invited Molly to review their troops; and as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long line of soldiers, nearly every man put a piece of money in the cocked hat which she held in her hand.|$|E
6000|$|Once {{more she}} found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table: [...] "now, I'll manage better this time" [...] she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and {{unlocking}} the door that led into the garden. Then she set to work eating the pieces of mushroom till she was about fifteen inches high: then <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> little passage: and then--{{she found herself}} at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flowerbeds and the cool fountains.|$|E
60|$|One day, as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{path to the}} brook, her big shoes {{scattering}} the pebbles {{right and}} left, she noticed a large beetle lying upon its back and struggling hard with its little legs to turn over, that its feet might again touch the ground. But this it could not accomplish; so the woman, who had a kind heart, reached down and gently turned the beetle with her finger. At once it scampered from the path and {{she went on to}} the brook.|$|E
60|$|Berenice {{rose to her}} feet. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> {{little room}} restlessly.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>walked</b> slowly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> path, and {{he hurried}} into the cottage. In a few minutes he overtook her, wrapped in a long Inverness cape from head to foot, and they walked on side by side.|$|R
60|$|He {{handed her}} a card and {{scribbled}} a telephone number upon it. They were in the station now, and their baggage {{in the hands of}} separate porters. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> slowly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> platform by his side.|$|R
