2500|$|As {{part of his}} job, Gerstenmaier {{made the}} final {{decision}} in September 2014 to not select Dream Chaser in the fourth phase of the Commercial Crew Development program—after the SNC Dream Chaser had been selected {{as one of the}} contract award recipients in each prior phase of the program—due to lack of maturity. SNC filed a protest to the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) alleging [...] "a high-ranking agency official [...] opted to rank Boeing’s proposal higher than a previous panel of agency procurement experts." [...] More specifically, Sierra Nevada asserted in their filings with the GAO that Gerstenmaier may have [...] "overstepped his authority by unilaterally changing the scoring criteria" [...] for the contract award. On January 5, 2015, the GAO denied SNC's protest and disagreed with the company's arguments about NASA's evaluation, finding [...] "no undue emphasis on NASA’s consideration of each offeror’s proposed schedule, and likelihood to achieve crew transportation <b>system</b> <b>certification</b> not later than 2017." [...] The GAO also noted that, contrary to SNC's assertions, the RFP did advise all parties their proposals would be evaluated against a goal of certification by the end of 2017.|$|E
