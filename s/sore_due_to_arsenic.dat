40|$|The {{occurrence}} of arsenic {{in drinking water}} is an issue of considerable interest. In the case of Bangladesh, arsenic concentrations have been closely monitored since the early 1990 s through an extensive sampling network. The focus of the present work is methodological. In particular, we propose the application of a holistochastic framework of human exposure to study lifetime population damage <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>arsenic</b> exposure across Bangladesh. The Bayesian Maximum Entropy theory is an important component of this framework, which possesses solid theoretical foundations and offers powerful tools to assimilate a variety of knowledge bases (physical, epidemiologic, toxicokinetic, demographic, etc.) and uncertainty sources (soft data, measurement errors, etc.). The holistochastic exposure approach leads to physically meaningful and informative spatial maps of arsenic distribution in Bangladesh drinking water. Global indicators of the adverse health effects on the population are generated, and valuable insight is gained by blending information from different scientific disciplines.

Comparison of cellular antioxidant enzyme activities showed that CHO-K 1 cells contained 3 - and 8 -fold more glutathione-peroxidase and catalase activities, respectively, than HFW cells.

We have also established arsenic-resistant cells, SA 7 and CL 3 R, from CHO cells and from a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (CL 3), respectively. The arsenic resistance of SA 7 cells was attributed mainly to elevation of glutathione S-transferase pi levels, and that of CL 3 R cells was possibly <b>due</b> <b>to</b> an increase in heme oxygenase activity.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of GaAs sulfidation under illumination and potentiodynamic polarization {{was investigated in}} acidified thiourea (TU) electrolytes. Sulfidation generated smooth surfaces, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy images; but analysis by inductively coupled plasma – mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) of spent electrolytes showed that this was in part <b>due</b> <b>to</b> GaAs dissolution. The initial step in sulfidation occurred through formation of elemental arsenic which then reacted with TU and forms As(III) sulfide, which was subsequently oxidized into As(V) sulfide and finally <b>to</b> <b>arsenic</b> sulfate. X- Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrated the initial formation of elemental As (XPS peak at 42 eV of As – As bond). XPS also showed three S 2 p doublets at 162. 4 eV which were assigned to (As(III) – S), 164. 4 eV for (As(V) – S) and 169. 1 eV for (S – O). The intensity of the XPS peak <b>due</b> <b>to</b> As(V) – S (S 2 p at 164. 4 eV) increased with prolonged exposure to sulfidation by the electrolyte, indicating the oxidation of As(III) into As(V) sulfide.
