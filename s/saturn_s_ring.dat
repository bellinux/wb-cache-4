40|$|We {{summarize}} recent observations by the Composite Infrared Spectrometer of Saturn, its rings, Titan, and the icy satellites. Limb {{observations of}} Saturn show vertical oscillations of temperatures and zonal-wind shears in the equatorial region {{that may be}} related to a temporal oscillation similar to the terrestrial QBO and Jupiter's QQO. There is also evidence of subsidence at mid-northern latitudes driven by the equatorial activity. Nadir-viewing observations show compact warm spots in the troposphere and stratosphere at both (summer and winter) poles, likely associated with subsidence. Observations of Titan have defined better the characteristics of the northern winter polar vortex, with 190 m/s winds surrounding a cold atmosphere at 1 microbar. The very warm polar stratopause at 10 microbar and the enhanced abundances of organic compounds suggest subsidence within the vortex. Analysis of the zonal structure in temperature indicates that the stratospheric zonal winds rotate about an axis that is displaced approximately 4. 1 deg from the IAU pole. Additional flybys, including a close one in March 2008, continue to characterize the endogenic activity in Enceladus s south polar region. Temperature maps of bright and dark terrains on Iapetus indicate that its ice is approximately stable to sublimation in the bright regions and highly unstable in the dark regions. Thermal mapping of <b>Saturn</b> <b>s</b> <b>rings</b> continues to constrain their composition, and observations at different solar phase angles, spacecraft elevations, solar elevations, and local hour angles have elucidated the effects of ring-particle shadowing and vertical motions on the thermal structure, and revealed the presence of small-scale structure associated with self-gravity wakes...|$|R

40|$|The {{origin of}} Saturnś massive ring system is still unknown. Two popular {{scenarios}} - the tidal splitting of passing comets and the collisional {{destruction of a}} satellite - rely on a high cometary flux in the past. In the present paper we attempt to quantify the cometary flux during the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) to assess the likelihood of both scenarios. Our analysis relies on the so-called Nice model {{of the origin of}} the LHB (Tsiganis et al., 2005; Morbidelli et al., 2005; Gomes et al., 2005) and on the size distribution of the primordial trans-Neptunian planetesimals constrained in Charnoz & Morbidelli (2007). We find that the cometary flux on Saturn during the LHB was so high that both scenarios for the formation of Saturn rings are viable in principle. However, a more detailed study shows that the comet tidal disruption scenario implies that all four giant planets should have comparable ring systems whereas the destroyed satellite scenario would work only for Saturn, and perhaps Jupiter. This is because in Saturnś system, the synchronous orbit is interior to the Roche Limit, which is a necessary condition for maintaining a satellite in the Roche zone up to the time of the LHB. We also discuss the apparent elimination of silicates from the ring parent body implied by the purity of the ice in <b>Saturn</b> <b>ś</b> <b>rings.</b> The LHB has also strong implications for the survival of the Saturnian satellites: all satellites smaller than Mimas would have been destroyed during the LHB, whereas Enceladus would have had from 40...|$|R
40|$|Collisions between {{planetary}} ring particles {{and in some}} protoplanetary disk environments occur at low impact velocities (v less than 1 m/s). In some regions of <b>Saturn</b> <b>s</b> <b>rings,</b> for example, the typical collision velocity inferred from observations by the Voyager spacecraft and dynamical modeling is {{a fraction of a}} centimeter per second. Although no direct observations of an individual ring particle exist, the abundance of dust in {{planetary ring}}s and protoplanetary disks suggests that larger ring and disk particles are coated with a layer of smaller particles and dust - the "regolith". Because the ring particles and proto-planetesimals are small (cm to m-sized), the regolith is only weakly bound to the surface by gravity. Similarly, secondary impacts on asteroids by large blocks of ejecta from high velocity cratering events result in low velocity impacts into the asteroid regolith, which is also weakly bound by the asteroid s gravity. At the current epoch and throughout their history, low velocity collisions have {{played an important role in}} sculpting planetary systems. In a one-Earth-gravity environment, it is not possible to experimentally determine the behavior of impact eject from such low velocity collisions. Impacts typically occur at speeds exceeding the mutual escape velocity of the two bodies. Thus, impacts at speeds on the order of 10 m/sec or less involve objects that are tens of meters across, or smaller. This research program is an experimental study of such low velocity collisions in a microgravity environment. The experimental work builds on the Collisions Into Dust Experiment (COLLIDE), which has flown twice on the space shuttle. The PRIME experimental apparatus is a new apparatus designed specifically for the environment provided on the NASA KC- 135 reduced gravity aircraft...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. As our abilities to utilise high performance computing to theoretically probe many astrophysical systems increases, a genuine need to relate to real systems becomes ever more important. Here, <b>Saturn</b> <b>s</b> <b>rings</b> {{can be used as}} a nearby laboratory to investigate in real time many astrophysical processes. One such system is the narrow F ring and its interaction with its inner shepherd moon Prometheus. Through numerical modelling and direct observations of the in-situ spacecraft Cassini we find new and exciting dynamics. These might help explain some of the asymmetries witnessed in the distribution of embedded moonlets and azimuthal ring brightness known to exist within the F ring. Spatially we find asymmetry in the Prometheus induced channel edges with regards to density, velocity and acceleration variations of ring particles. Channel edges that show fans (embedded moonlets) are also the locations of highly localised increases in densities, velocity and acceleration changes where opposing edges are considerably less localised in their distribution. As a result of the highly localised nature of the velocity and acceleration changes chaotic fluctuations in density were witnessed. However, this could seek to work in favour of creating coherent objects at this channel edge as density increases were significantly large. Thus, density here had a greater chance of being enhanced beyond the local Roche density. Accompanied with these dynamics was the discovery of a non-zero component to vorticity in the perturbed area of the F ring post encounter. By removal of the background Keplerian flow we find that encounters typically created a large scale rotation of 10, 000 km^ 2. Within this area a much more rich distribution of local rotations is also seen located in and around the channel edges. Although the real F ring and our models are non-hydrodynamical in nature the existence of a curl in the velocity vector field in the perturbed region could offer some interesting implications for those systems that are gas rich...|$|R

[2006] for <b>Saturn</b> <b>s</b> auroral response to the solar wind, versus the reconnection model of <b>Saturn</b> <b>s</b> aurora by Cowley et al. [2005]. We use Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) Ion Mass Spectrometer (IMS) and Electron Plasma Spectrometer (ELS) observations to characterize the plasma environment. ELS and magnetometer observations are used to map out the morphology of the outer magnetosphere from dawn to midnight local time. IMS observations are used to measure plasma flow velocities from which one can infer rotation versus convective flows. IMS composition measurements are used to trace the source of plasma from the inner magnetosphere (protons, H 2 and water group ions) versus an external solar wind source (protons and Heff ions). A critical parameter for both models is the strength of the convection electric field with respect to the rotational electric field for the large scale magnetosphere. Is there a significant return flow from the magnetotail? Pitch angle distributions also play an important role as a discriminator. If the magnetosphere tends to conserve angular momentum as suggested by Sittler et al. [2006], then we expect to see an anti-correlation between rotational flow component and radial flow velocities.

40|$|One of the {{possible}} loss processes for <b>Saturn</b> <b>s</b> E-ring is ionization followed by acceleration by the electric field associated with the corotating magnetized plasma. It is possible to determine if this process is occurring by detecting electromagnetic waves at the gyrofrequency of water group ions. If the energy the particle gains in this pick-up process is sufficiently great, the picked up ions will generate ion cyclotron waves. Pioneer 11 and Voyager 1 both observed intervals of such waves associated with water group ions during their passes through <b>Saturn</b> <b>s</b> E-ring. Presently the magnetometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft is also seeing water group ion cyclotron oscillations. The Cassini data allow the spatial and temporal behavior of the waves to be mapped in ways not possible during the previous flybys. Analyses of these waves allow us to study the rate of mass loading and its latitudinal and local time variation. In conjunction with previous data, we can then determine the variation as the inclination of the ring to the Sun changes, in accordance with Saturn's seasons. These waves may be the clue to how Saturn powers its magnetosphere as the newly born ions could be the driver for the radial motion of the plasma and to how the E-ring may play the equivalent role to that of Io in the jovian magnetosphere...|$|R
