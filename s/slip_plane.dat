Climb-glide creep could be illustrated as follows: when the applied stress is not enough to for a moving dislocation to overcome the obstacle on its way via dislocation glide alone, the dislocation could climb to a parallel <b>slip</b> <b>plane</b> by diffusional processes, and the dislocation can glide on the new plane.

40|$|The post-perovskite {{phase of}} (Mg,Fe) SiO 3 is {{believed}} to be the main mineral phase of the Earth’s lowermost mantle (the D 00 layer). Its properties explain 1 – 6 numerous geophysical obser- vations associated with this layer — for example, the D 00 discon- tinuity 7, its topography 8 and seismic anisotropy within the layer 9. Here we use a novel simulation technique, ﬁrst-principles metadynamics, to identify a family of low-energy polytypic stacking-fault structures intermediate between the perovskite and post-perovskite phases. Metadynamics trajectories identify plane sliding involving the formation of stacking faults as the most favourable pathway for the phase transition, and as a likely mechanism for plastic deformation of perovskite and post- perovskite. In particular, the predicted <b>slip</b> <b>planes</b> are 010 for perovskite (consistent with experiment 10, 11) and 110 for post- perovskite (in contrast to the previously expected 010 <b>slip</b> <b>planes</b> 1 – 4).

40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the mechanical response, plastic activities, and failure of bulk ceramic and nanocrystalline metal at the atomistic scale. Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed for nanoindentation on the crystalline cubic silicon carbide (3 C-SiC) and sulfur-induced embrittlement at nickel grain boundaries.; Multimillion-atom molecular dynamics simulations of nanoindentation on 3 C-SiC surfaces corresponding to three different crystallographic directions, (110), (001), and (111), have been performed using pyramidal-shaped Vickers indenter with 90 ˚ edge angle. Load-displacement (P-h) curves show major and minor pop-in events during loading. Our analysis shows that the first minor discontinuity in the P-h curve of (110) indentation is related to nucleation of dislocations, whereas the subsequent major load-drops {{are related to the}} dissipation of accumulated energy by expansion of dislocation loops and changes of <b>slip</b> <b>planes.</b> Detailed quantitative analysis on the stress distribution on <b>slip</b> <b>planes</b> and stress concentration at kinks and dislocation cores has estimated the Peierls stress to be 7. 5 GPa~ 0. 039 G, where G is the shear modulus. We have observed anisotropic pileup patterns which all reside on (111) and (- 1 - 11) <b>slip</b> <b>planes</b> after the indenter is unloaded. These patterns are closely related to dislocation activities on the two <b>slip</b> <b>planes.</b> The anisotropy is a consequence of the asymmetry of the 3 C-SiC crystal in which only (111) and (- 1 - 11) <b>slip</b> <b>planes</b> are active out of { 111 } family.; Alteration of fracture behaviors of a material by minute segregated impurities at grain boundaries is a fundamental question encompassing chemistry, mechanics and material science. One of the well-known examples is sulfur segregation-induced embrittlement of nickel grain boundaries, where coincidence between the critical sulfur concentration for embrittlement and that for amorphization remains unexplained. We have performed 48 million-atom reactive molecular dynamics simulations and first-principles quantum-mechanical calculations to investigate the role of sulfur. A direct link between sulfur-induced intergranular amorphization and embrittlement is thus established. Analysis shows that an order-of-magnitude reduction of grain-boundary shear strength due to amorphization, combined with tensile-strength reduction, allows the crack tip to always find an easy propagation path. This mechanism explains an experimentally observed crossover from transgranular to intergranular fracture and suppressed plastic activities due to sulfur segregation...|$|R

The above grains exhibited a tendency to split into deformation bands having alternating orientations and largely separated by transition regions comprising arrays of closely spaced, extended sub-boundaries collectively accommodating large misorientations across very small distances.
