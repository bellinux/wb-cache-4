Objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of supplementary irrigation on ten genotypes of chickpea crop, in order to select the most suitable ones for a sustainable agriculture in the context of scarcity of water resources. A split-plot experiment was carried out at Policoro, Southern Italy, on a sub-alkaline, silt-clay alluvial soil. The supplementary irrigation was compared with non-irrigated cultivation. The climatic conditions during the crop growing season were characterized by average temperatures higher than the normal ones during the winter months, and a remarkable drought, except in January. Three genotypes (Pa 34 and cultivars Sultano and Pascià) showed a higher yielding potential in these environmental conditions reaching values from 436 to 492 g m- 2.

Castell. & Germano) is a serious wheat disease {{occurring}} all over the world. The pathogen attacks epigeous parts of the plant, with direct damage on kernel quality causing heavy yield losses (Eyal et al., 1987). In Italy the disease has been observed in the most important cereal growing areas (Pasquini et al., 2002; Iori et al., 2003). The aim of this preliminary study was to compare the effect of Stagonospora nodorum on electrophoretic protein pattern durum wheat (cv. Simeto) according to the following tests: shrivelled kernels from artificially infected plants in field plots directly analyzed and after incubation period on water agar; finally the sound kernels of the same variety infected in laboratory and then incubated on water agar plates. An isolate of Stagonospora nodorum obtained from durum wheat {{was used for the}} spore suspension (1 x 106 spore ml- 1) utilized for artificial inoculation. Conidial suspension was applied on the plants at ear emergence. Seed samples were harvested at maturity. <b>Shrivelled</b> field <b>seeds</b> were directly tested while other <b>shrivelled</b> <b>seeds</b> were incubated for six days on water agar plates, crushed in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried. Moreover sterilized sound kernels were inoculated in laboratory with the aforesaid conidial suspension and incubated on water agar plates for a period of six days. These last seed samples were taken at different days, crushed in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried. The wholemeal flour of all samples were subjected to electrophoretic analysis. Extraction of proteins were obtained according to Payne et al. (1980). Glutenins were selectively extracted following the sequential procedure of Singh et al. (1991). The 1 -D electrophoresis based on procedure of Payne et al. (1980) was performed on sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE).

40|$|Wheat {{is one of}} {{the staple}} food crops in major areas of the world {{providing}} the required carbohydrate and proteins in our diet. A decrease in the total yield of wheat has been observed worldwide due to elevation in environmental temperature. Heat stress causes pollen sterility, drying of stigmatic fluid, pseudo-seed setting, empty pockets in endosperm and <b>shrivelled</b> <b>seeds</b> in wheat. Every plant system has defence mechanisms to cope up with the different environmental challenges. The defence mechanisms of wheat consist of heat responsive miRNAs, signalling molecules, transcription factors and stress associated proteins like heat shock proteins (HSPs), antioxidant enzymes etc. Wheat is sensitive to heat stress especially in stages like pollination to milky dough kernel stages is critical for growth and development. Heat stress causes an oxidative burst inside cell system followed by increase in the expression of various proteins like protein kinases, HSPs and antioxidant enzymes. These stress proteins modulate the defence mechanisms of wheat by protecting the denaturation and aggregation of nascent proteins involved in various metabolic reactions. Genetic variation has been observed with respect to expression and accumulation of these stress proteins. Exogenous treatment of various hormones, signalling molecules and chemicals has been reported to enhance the thermotolerance level of wheat under heat stress. Tools of genetic engineering have been also used to develop wheat transgenic lines with over-expression of stress proteins under heat stress condition.

In wheat, the Hyderabad isolate of IPCV (IPCV-H) induced symptoms resembling the rosette caused by soil-borne wheat mosaic virus, and these were apparent only three weeks after emergence. Early-infected plants were severely stunted and dark green, with chlorotic streaks on the youngest leaves, which turned necrotic as the plants aged; most of these plants died. Late-infected plants were also stunted and were conspicuous in the field because of their dark green appearance {{as a result of}} delayed maturity. The virus was detected by ELISA and nucleic acid hybridization in all plants with symptoms. These plants usually produced fewer tillers than healthy ones.

40|$|Angiosperm seed {{development}} requires co-ordinated {{development of}} the embryo and a second zygotic tissue, the endosperm. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the endosperm is ephemeral and is largely consumed by the embryo during seed development. In addition to a role in embryo nutrition, it is also likely that the endosperm may play a more direct role in signalling to the embryo to regulate development. Despite their importance for embryo development, these processes are very poorly understood. The ZHOUPI (ZOU) gene provides an important tool to address these problems. Firstly, ZOU likely regulates endosperm breakdown. Whereas wild-type seed have a single layer of endosperm at maturity, zou seed has a large persistent endosperm and a correspondingly small embryo. The small zou embryo does not fill the seed so that the <b>seed</b> <b>shrivels</b> as it desiccates during maturation. Secondly, zou embryos have defects in their cuticle, so that the endosperm adheres to the embryo throughout seed development. After seed germination, zou cotyledons develop holes in their epidermis as they expand, {{probably due to the}} defects in the cuticle. ZHOUPI (ZOU) encodes a bHLH transcription factor and is expressed in the embryo surrounding region (ESR) of endosperm but not in the embryo itself. The role of ZOU in cuticle development is partly mediated by the ABNORMAL LEAF SHAPE 1 (ALE 1) gene. Thus, ale 1 mutants also show defects in embryonic cuticle development and ALE 1 is specifically expressed in ESR in a ZOU-dependent fashion. It was unclear whether the effects of ZOU upon embryo development are an indirect consequence of the persistent endosperm mechanically impeding embryo expansion, or rather reflect a more direct role of the ESR in signalling to the embryo. The main aims of this thesis were 1) to provide evidence that ZOU regulates endosperm cell death and 2) to test whether ZOU function in controlling endosperm cell death could be separated from that in embryonic epidermal cuticle development. To achieve this goal, 1) TUNEL assays were performed in the seeds to confirm the zou endosperm cell death phenotype, 2) ALE 1 expression in the ESR in zou mutants was rescued using the ZOU-independent AtSUC 5 promoter to investigate whether one or both of zou phenotypes were complemented, 3) Candidate ZOU target genes were validated and characterized to determine their functions in endosperm cell death and/or embryonic epidermal cuticle development. The TUNEL assays revealed that zou mutants display less DNA fragmentation in the ESR than that of the wild-type, but that zou did not have defects in cell death outside the seeds suggesting ZOU specifically regulated endosperm cell death. The AtSUC 5 ::ALE 1 transgene partially rescued zou defects in epidermal cuticle but not in endosperm cell death. This shows that the defects in the zou cuticle are not caused by the defective endosperm, rather zou has distinct, separable functions. Lastly, I characterised several novel ZOU targets and showed that RGP 3 may be a direct ZOU target as it is expressed in ESR in ZOU dependent fashion, whereas RGP 4 is likely indirect as it is expressed in the testa and up-regulated in zou mutants. In conclusion, ZOU has independent roles in endosperm cell death and embryonic epidermal cuticle development. Because ALE 1, which largely mediates the role in cuticle development, is less widely conserved than is ZOU, the role in promoting endosperm cell death may be the ancestral function of ZOU...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Genetics)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. Gene {{transfer}} from wild gras species to wheat {{is complicated by}} the simultaneous integration of large amounts of alien chromatin. The alien chromatin containing the target gene is inherited as a linkage block and the phenomenon is known as linkage drag. The degree of linkage drag depends on whether, and how readily, recombination occurs between the foreign and wheat chromatin. The S 13 translocation line was developed by the department of Genetics, US. A cross was made between Chinese Spring and a leaf rust resistant Aegilops speltoides accession. Resistant backcross F 1 was backcrossed to Chinese Spring and W 84 - 17. S 13 was selected from the backcross progeny and found to carry three rust resistance genes temporarily named LrS 13, SrS 13 and YrS 13. Unfortunately, the resistance genes were completely linked to gametocidal (Gc) genes that were co-transferred from the wild parent. In wheat Gc genes cause reduced fertility, poor plant phenotype and hybrid necrosis. In order to use employ the rust resistance genes commercially they need to be separated from the Gc genes. At the onset of this study four putative shortened forms of the S 13 translocation were provided. The four lines were identified in a homoeologous paring induction experiment (involving the test cross 04 M 127). This study aimed to achieve the following: (i) characterize the four recombinants with the use of molecular markers, (ii) use the knowledge gained to identify further recombinants in the 04 M 127 cross, (iii) identify the shortest (most useful) recombinant, and (iv) attempt to shorten the shortest recombinant form still further and thereby remove as many of the Gc genes as possible. In total, seven recombinants of the S 13 translocation (04 M 127 - 1, - 2, - 3, - 4, - 7, - 11 and - 12; referred to as recombinant group A) were identified and characterised with microsatellite and SCAR markers. These recombinants have exchanged different amounts of foreign chromatin for wheat chromatin, but were still associated with Gc genes, showing hybrid necrosis and <b>seed</b> <b>shrivelling.</b> Some of the recombinants have lost the undesirable „brittle rachis‟ phenotype which occurs in Ae. speltoides and the S 13 translocation line. In plants VII having this trait, the rachis spontaneously disarticulates after the third spikelet upon ripening of the ear. Recombinant 3 appeared to be least affected by Gc genes and was therefore used in further attempts to shorten the translocation. Recombinant 3 was crossed with wheat (W 84 - 17) and resistant F 1 (heterozygous for the translocation) were test crossed with Chinese Spring nullisomic 3 A tetrasomic 3 B/D plants. Thirty five resistant testcross F 1 plants were identified (named recombinant group B). The resistant group B recombinants as well as nine susceptible test cross F 1 (which also appeared to be recombinant) were characterised making use of microsatellites and a SCAR marker. From the results it appeared that each of the 35 resistant plants exchanged substantial amounts of Ae. speltoides chromatin for wheat chromatin. The species chromatin that remained (and which contains LrS 13) is probably located either close to the 3 AS telomere or within the proximal regions of 3 AS and 3 AL. A SCAR marker that has been developed specifically for the S 13 translocation provided useful confirmation of the presence of Ae. speltoides chromatin in the 35 recombinants. If the SCAR marker proves to be tightly linked to LrS 13 it may eventually be used for marker assisted selection of the resistance or it may be employed in continued attempts {{to reduce the amount of}} foreign chromatin. Seedling rust resistance tests showed that the recombinants have lost SrS 13 and YrS 1 during recombination. An attempt was also made to develop additional markers that specifically detect the translocation in order to further characterise the group B recombinants. Published information on Ae. speltoides specific repeated and transposon sequences were obtained and used for primer design. Unfortunately, no suitable markers could be found and the primers that were designed tended to amplify the same fragments in both the wheat and species genomes. DArT markers were also employed in an attempt to characterise the 35 group B recombinants and controls. The DArT results provided an independent verification of the results obtained with the microsatellite markers. The DArT results confirmed that the group B recombinants exchanged large amounts of species chromatin for wheat chromatin. Even though the 35 resistant group B recombinants have undergone extensive recombination they still show signs of residual Gc effects. It is believed these effects can be removed by continued backcrossing to wheat accompanied by selection against Gc symptoms. While the effects of Gc genes per se were not studied, their properties were reminiscent of those of transposable elements. Indications were that complex interactions involving the Gc genes themselves as well as genetic factors in the wheat genome may have a drastic effect on the selective survival of recombinant gametes...|$|R
40|$|In a {{wide range}} of crops the average yield loss caused by {{nematodes}} is estimated to be 10 - 15 %. Sometimes it can be total. Food and cash crops are susceptible to one of the many types of these tiny soil-borne, thread-like parasitic roundworms. They feed and reproduce within the host plant, affect growth, and can cause distorted seeds, and rotten or malformed roots and tubers. Damaged tissues cannot get enough nutrients and water from the soil to maintain normal growth, and a poor harvest results. Often farmers attribute this disappointing performance to poor soil, water stress, or salinity rather than to the true cause Once a soil is infested {{it is virtually impossible to}} eliminate the nematodes, removing the host plant for long periods by crop rotation is rarely adequate. However, damage can be limited. Since most plant-parasitic nematodes spend part of their life-cycle in the soil, they can be killed there by nematicides, but two major disadvantages of these are their toxicity, and the fact that their effect is short-term. Thus repeated use is necessary to prevent a resurgence of the problem later in the growing season. Despite the widespread and serious damage caused by nematodes in the Tropics, the use of nematicides is not common because farmers lack financial resources. While removing the host plant for long periods by crop rotation is inadequate to control nematodes, appropriate techniques exist which are less costly and less damaging to man and to the environment than the repeated use of chemicals. Under slash and burn systems or shifting cultivation, land was unlikely to become nematode-infested; however, the natural balance is easily upset by fixed farming and the introduction of new crops and cultivars. Identifying nematode damage The detection of nematodes is the first step to control. Relatively few nematodes can be passed on in seed but, of those that are, some are easily detectable by their effects such as the blackened seed galls caused in wheat and distorted and discoloured seeds of beans. The peanut/groundnut seed nematode found in Nigeria makes the <b>seed</b> <b>shrivelled</b> and dark brown, and is seed transmitted if the seeds are left in their pods or are not thoroughly dried. A rice nematode, Ditylenchus angustus, is found in freshly-harvested seeds, and can also be killed by sun-drying but, like a number of foliar nematodes, can still be carried in plant debris mixed with seed. In yams and potatoes, nematodes produce small yellow lesions just under the surface which develop into a dark brown dry rot and some cause knobbly tubers. Infected tubers must not be used for planting. Nematodes are common causes of damage to dessert and cooking bananas. They are spread in the vegetative corms used to grow new plants, and the symptoms are most noticeable in the roots of suckers immediately after lifting - as purple or dark brown lesions seen when the root is split lengthwise. There may also be dark areas on the root surface. The first signs of nematode infection in taro are red streaks in the centre of the corm; these allow bacteria and fungi to establish, and the corm can rot away completely. All seedlings should have their roots checked for swellings, or galls or distorted shapes prior to transplanting. Unlike Rhizobium nodules in leguminous plants, nematode galls are an integral part of the root. Damage limitation Once a farmer notices nematode damage to root or leaf, there is little to be done that season other than to remove and destroy infected plants and increase amounts of water and fertiliser to compensate. In alleycropping, perennial trees and food and cash crops can even exchange nematodes, but the problem can be contained by careful choice of planting material and land use. Nematode-free stem cuttings can be taken from sugar cane and cassava, and also from kumara, though tubers and roots can pass on the pest. Using part of a yam tuber for planting means that farmers can check for damage. Citrus can be propagated by marcotts or cuttings. Extension services must avoid distributing nematodes with cocoa, coffee or other tree seedlings. Seedbed soils can be kept pestfree by annual or seasonal rotation of the seedbed site, always using previously uncultivated ground. Dry season crop seed beds can be allowed to flood; wet season crop seedbeds should be kept free of weeds; soil can be turned frequently in dry periods since exposure to the sun kills a large proportion of nematodes; brushwood, crop, seed residues, and dried dung may be burned to kill the nematodes Nematode populations can also be reduced by incorporating chicken manure, green manure, sawdust, cocoa pods or cassava peelings into the soil. Some plants, such as mustard and marigold (Tagetes spp) have nematicidal properties. Strict plant hygiene and early detection will help prevent the disastrous damage wreaked by nematodes, and are far cheaper and less hazardous than the use of chemical nematicides.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Fruit {{and seed}} (grain) are major {{components}} of world crop production {{that need to}} be doubled over the next 50 years to meet population demand and hence secure food security. Moreover, the issue has become increasingly urgent and challenging by increased frequencies of global warming-associated events imposing abiotic stresses (e. g. drought; heat) and biotic stresses that have caused severe yield losses. During fruit development, fruit set is the most important stage for the realization of crop yield potential. Sinks (e. g. fruit and seed) rely on import of sucrose (Suc) produced from photosynthetic leaves (sources). Invertases (Inv), and particularly cell wall invertases (CWIN), are the enzymes responsible for hydrolysing phloem-imported Suc into, glucose (Glc) and fructose (Fru) during early seed and fruit development. The CWIN-derived hexoses function as both signalling molecules regulating gene expression and substrates to fuel energy production and provide carbon skeletons for biosynthetic and storage processes. The mechanistic basis as to how CWIN regulates fruit set is unknown. The question is technically difficult to address using CWIN-knockout or silenced plants as they often grow poorly with <b>shrivelled</b> or non-viable <b>seeds.</b> By silencing its inhibitor gene (INH), the endogenous CWIN activities were elevated, causing significant increases in tomato fruit hexose levels and seed weights (Jin et al 2009). This discovery provides a unique opportunity to explore the mechanism by which CWIN regulates fruit and seed development without potential complications from misexpression of foreign CWIN genes as the case for many over-expression studies. Fruit set is the most important stage for the realization of crop yield potentials. In our study, we focused on ovaries and fruitlets at 2 days before and 2 days after anthesis respectively (2 dba ovaries and 2 daa fruitlets). These two developmental stages span the fruit set process in tomato. To understand the role of CWIN and related genes in assimilate distribution in fruit set, potential regulators or functionally related proteins controlling CWIN activity and sugar transporters potentially involved in Suc unloading were investigated. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified no new functional CWINs, but a defective CWIN (SldeCWIN 1), as well as a new CWIN inhibitor (SlINVINH 2) in the tomato genome. SldeCWIN 1 and inhibitors (INHs) are both potential regulators of CWIN activity. Transcript expression profile revealed that SlCWIN 1 is the dominant CWIN during fruit set. The transcript levels of SlCWIN 1 in WT plants decreased sharply in transiting from 2 dba ovaries to 2 daa fruitlets. The two potential regulators in controlling CWIN activity showed different expression patterns during fruit set. SlINVINH 1 was expressed in both 2 dba ovaries and 2 daa fruitlets and its expression levels were not changed significantly during fruit set. However, the transcripts of the newly-identified SlINVINH 2 and SldeCWIN 1 were only detected in 2 - dba ovaries, but not in 2 daa fruitlets. The activity of CWIN was elevated significantly while VIN and CIN activities were not changed in 2 daa fruitlets as compared to 2 dba ovaries. The results indicate that CWIN, but not VIN and CIN, plays an important role during fruit set. Also, it is clear that there is a discrepancy between the transcripts of CWIN (decreased) and the CWIN activity (elevated) in 2 daa fruitlets when compared to 2 dba ovaries. Silencing the expression of SlINVINH 1 did not affect the expression of SlCWIN 1 and SldeCWIN 1. This indicates that elevated CWIN activity is regulated by SlINVINH 1 at the post-translational level. The defective CWIN has been shown to enhance inhibition of CWIN activity in the presence of INH in tobacco extracts. Thus, we propose that a high level of SldeCWIN 1 expression may help SlINVINH 1 and SlINVINH 2 to reduce SlCWIN 1 activity in 2 dba ovaries. In contrast, the near absence of SldeCWIN 1 and SlINVINH 2 expression in 2 daa fruitlets could alleviate the inhibition, leading to an increase in CWIN activity through post-translational regulation. In regard to sugar transporters, 2 SlSUTs (SlSUT 2 and SlSUT 4), 2 SlHTs (SlHT 2, SlHT 3), 2 putative Glc-transporting SWEETs (SlSWEET 1 a, 1 b) and 2 putative Suc-transporting SWEETs (SlSWEET 12 b, SlSWEET 12 c) may involve in Suc unloading during fruit set. Among these genes, only SlSWEET 12 c was responsive to elevated CWIN activity. The expression level of SlSWEET 12 c was increased in 2 daa fruitlets of SlINVINH 1 -RNAi as compared to WT plants. The results indicate that expression of SlSWEET 12 c may be functionally coupled with that of SlCWIN 1. CWIN, located in cell walls of sieve elements of 2 dba ovaries and 2 daa fruitlets, degrades Suc into hexoses to create a steep Suc concentration between sieve elements and the apoplasm of recipient cells. Thus, the role of SWEET 12 c might be involved in releasing Suc into the apoplasm of recipient cells from sieve elements to provide sugar supply to drive fruit set. The physiological role of CWIN is determined, in part, by Suc unloading pathways. Before examining the phloem-unloading pathway within ovaries or fruitlets, we firstly tested the hypothesis of the pedicel phloem of 2 dba ovaries imposes a limitation on Suc delivery to the ovaries. Estimated specific mass transfer (SMT) of biomass through the pedicel sieve elements of 2 dba ovaries indicate that the sieve elements did not impose a limitation to Suc delivery to 2 dba ovaries. The result indicates that the sieve elements in the pedicel have transport spare capacity in 2 dba ovaries. Thus, we focused on the phloem unloading pathways within the ovaries and fruitlets themselves. In 2 dba ovaries, Suc unloading follows apoplasmic pathway in 2 dba ovary wall and placenta connecting to the ovules while symplasmic pathway within placenta areas. In 2 daa fruitlets, phloem unloading switches to a symplasmic pathway in the pericarp, but remains apoplasmic in placenta connecting to seeds and symplasmic pathways within placenta areas. The phloem unloading pathway remained unchanged in 2 dba ovaries and 2 daa fruitlets of SlINVINH 1 -RNAi and was comparable to that of WT plants. This implies that plasmodesmata conductivity or formation is not influenced by CWIN activity. Thus, Glc, as a carbon source for callose deposition around the neck region of plasmodesmata, is likely derived from the sucrose synthase and not the Inv pathway. The analyses revealed different physiological roles CWIN may play in phloem unloading in these different locations within the ovaries and fruitlets. During tomato fruit set, the Suc import rate increases from 6 nmol Suc/h in 2 dba ovaries to 39 nmol Suc/h in 2 daa fruitlets. As a consequence, significant changes must take place at the cellular level to underpin such dramatic increases in assimilate delivery for fruit set. In this context, we found that sieve elements are structurally more advanced in 2 daa fruitlets when compared to 2 dba ovaries. However, the less developed phloem in the ovaries does not appear to represent a limitation to phloem unloading since calculation of SMT value shows phloem development did not impose any limitation on phloem transport. Lastly, we examined what genes and biochemical pathways respond to changes in CWIN activity during ovary-to-fruit transition using transcriptome and metabolome analyses. Comparing ovaries with fruitlets showed that these organs exhibited remarkably different response to elevated CWIN activity in the transgenic plants where SlINVINH 1 was silenced. We found that there were only 7 genes whose transcript levels exhibited changes to an elevation of CWIN activity in 2 daa fruitlets. By contrast, 319 transcripts were differentially expressed in 2 dba ovaries of SlINVINH 1 -RNAi (CWIN activity elevated) compared to WT plants. The results revealed that 2 dba ovaries are far more responsive to elevated CWIN activity as compared to fruitlets at the transcript level. Gene functional classification analyses revealed that the transcript levels of biotic, ethylene synthesis and cell cyclin-related genes were generally increased, but the mRNA levels of genes for photosynthesis, protein degradation and receptor like kinase-related genes were decreased, along with a large number of cell wall-related genes exhibiting differential expression in 2 dba ovaries of SlINVINH 1 -RNAi when compared to WT plants. Of particular significance is the enhanced expression of pathogen resistance (R) genes and pathogenesis-related (PR) genes in 2 dba ovaries in response to elevation of CWIN activity. Some genes involved in R-gene mediated pathway were also differentially expressed in 2 dba ovaries in CWIN elevated plants. They include cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase, pathogenesis-related ERFs and a small GTPase (ROP). These results indicate that elevated CWIN activity enhanced R gene-mediated pathways for biotic resistance in the ovary. As plant defense reactions consume considerable resources and energy, it may affect plant development. However, we did not find any negative phenotypic impact during fruit set in the transgenic plants. Interestingly, the levels of a number of transcripts encoding proteins involved in protein degradation were significantly decreased in the transgenic ovaries, suggesting a prolonged protein turnover rate, which could save metabolic energy for synthesis of new proteins to boost the defence capacity of the ovaries. Overall, the data presented in this thesis have unraveled several novel aspects of the mechanisms by which CWIN regulate fruit set. We found that CWIN activity is under tight post-translational regulation in ovaries as compared to that in fruitlets, likely regulated by INHs and defective CWIN. Also, the findings allow us to us to formulate a model on how CWIN and sugar transporters may work together to regulate phloem unloading of Suc during the ovary-to-fruitlet transition. Finally, we discovered that elevation of CWIN activity enhanced R and PR gene expression, thereby potentially increasing the defence capacity of the ovaries against pathogens for fruit set...|$|R
