While, among others, Lord Mayor Paul Mattig and Archbishop Bertram called for a continuance of public duty and order General Pfeil of the VI Army Corps released all political prisoners, ordered his soldiers to leave the barracks and, as his last military order, allowed {{a demonstration of the}} Social Democrats in the Jahrhunderthalle. One day later soldiers councils in the army and the Committee of Public <b>Savety</b> were formed. On the same day a Volksrat (peoples council) of Social Democrats, Liberals, the Catholic Centre Party and trade unions was founded, led by Social Democrat Paul Löbe. As relations between the Volksrat and his opponents were mostly consensual the [...] "revolution" [...] in Breslau was peaceful.Despite the largely peaceful transition Breslau faced several challenges which radicalized the political landscape of the city. Social conditions got worse as 170,000 soldiers and displaced persons were expected to return, with only 47,000 available quarters. The prospect of a Communist government was a major fear. The loss of nearby Posnania to a newly created Poland, the prospect of further losses in Upper Silesia and the transformation of neighbouring Bohemia into a hostile new state called Czechoslovakia spread anxiety among people, who saw their city turn into an advance post of Germany.The number of Poles in the city dropped from an already low 4-5.000 to 0.5 percent 20 years later.|$|E

The main factors of the failure of mycorrhizal application can be caused by no review for the specifity of mycorrhiza with the host or autobion or with media conditios of with the aspect of plant dependency to mycorrhiza. The purposes of present study was to find the mycorrhizal strains which having high tolerancy and effectivity for rice either in upland or wetland conditions or for both conditions, in order to be used as biofertilizer specific for rice.
