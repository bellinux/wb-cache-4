40|$|Motivated by {{studies of}} dress and the {{importance}} that it has on identity formation and expression of self, this research tries {{to answer the question}} of how can an interactive tool create greater means for self-expression of the dressed body through the design of textiles? The goal of pursuing the question is to ultimately promote a more sustainable fashion culture that relies on the creation of long-lasting products. Employing Research through Design as the main methodology, this research went through a series of sequential design experiments – namely workshops and prototypes – with the ambition of generating knowledge {{in the context of the}} design space, and in order to inform the design of the interactive tool proposed by the research question. The main research findings suggest that the direct engagement with the painting of textiles through ruled <b>self-reflection</b> <b>tasks,</b> in collaboration with a machine, provides great means for the creation of long-lasting products – showing, therefore, a fruitful path towards fashion sustainability. In addition to the conception and building of a final artifact, this research resulted in a set of guidelines that aims at advising the creation of other future artifacts...|$|E
40|$|People {{lie about}} the past. They {{may lie in}} order to avoid consequences, to {{facilitate}} social bonding, or to make sense of their knowledge and their experiences. These reasons closely parallel proposed functions of memory flexibility, and a handful of studies have shown that under certain conditions, fabricating past events can lead to false memories and beliefs. Little research, however, has specifically examined whether lying about the personal past can alter autobiographical memory. The present studies are an investigation of how fabricating past experiences influences autobiographical memory, and the role of self-enhancing biases in guiding this influence. 	Across three studies, participants were prompted to compose written fabrications about a childhood event that was unlikely to have occurred. Specifically, they wrote stories were rich with perceptual and emotional detail and embellished with plausible false content. After a short delay, they were asked to disregard their fabrications and provide sincere memory reports. Results indicated that fabrications influenced the subsequent memory reports, especially when the fabrications were thematically self-enhancing. Study 2 was a replication of Study 1, with additional experimental conditions intended to disentangle the influence of emotional valence from the self-enhancing features of the events, and to address the possibility that changes in mood accounted for the observed patterns. Results indicated that neither event valence, nor mood, could explain the patterns observed in Studies 1 and 2. In a third and final study, participants first completed one of three possible <b>self-reflection</b> <b>tasks,</b> which varied in their self-affirming and self-threatening characteristics. Next, they completed a fabrication task and memory questionnaire, as in Studies 1 and 2. Results indicated that self-affirming reflections yielded patterns of memory distortion similar to Studies 1 and 2, while self-threatening reflections appeared to reverse that pattern [...] threatened participants were less likely to incorporate self-enhancing fabrications into memory, and more likely to incorporate self-diminishing fabrications. The findings are considered in the context of theoretical questions surrounding motivational influences on how people recall past events...|$|E
40|$|Clinical and phenomenological {{accounts}} of schizophrenia suggest that impairments in self-reflective processes significantly contribute to psychopathological expression. Recent imaging studies observe atypical cerebral activation patterns during self-reflection, especially around the cortical midline structures, both in psychosis-prone adults and individuals with schizophrenia. Given that self-reflection processes consolidate during adolescence, and that early transient expression of psychosis (positive schizotypy) also arises during this period, {{the present study}} sought to examine whether atypical cerebral activation during <b>self-reflection</b> <b>task</b> could be associated with early schizotypic expression during adolescence. Forty-two neurotypical adolescent participants (19 females) aged from 12 to 19 (15. 92 ± 1. 9) underwent a <b>self-reflection</b> <b>task</b> using functional neuroimaging (fMRI), where they had to evaluate trait adjectives (1 to 4 ratings) about themselves or their same sex best friend. The Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) was employed to assess positive schizotypic expression. Results showed that positive schizotypy in adolescents significantly correlated with cortical midline activation patterns in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), {{as well as the}} dorsolateral PFC and the lingual gyrus. The results are consistent with previous imaging literature on self-reflection and schizophrenia. They further highlight that the relationship between self-reflection processes and positive schizotypy operates at the trait level of expression and can be observed as early as adolescence...|$|R

50|$|In {{an attempt}} to compare the {{self-evaluation}} motives (excluding self-improvement) a <b>self-reflection</b> <b>task</b> was employed. Participants were asked to choose the question they would most likely ask themselves {{in order to determine}} whether they possessed a certain personality trait. On the whole, people self-enhanced more than they self-assessed or self-verified. People chose higher diagnosticity questions concerning central, positive traits than central, negative ones, and answered yes more often to central, positive than negative questions.

40|$|Body image {{distress}} or {{body dissatisfaction}} {{is one of}} the most common consequences of obesity and overweight. We investigated the neural bases of body image processing in overweight and average weight young women to understand whether brain regions that were previously found to be involved in processing self-reflective, perspective and affective components of body image would show different activation between two groups. Thirteen overweight (O-W group, age = 20. 31 ± 1. 70 years) and thirteen average weight (A-W group, age = 20. 15 ± 1. 62 years) young women underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a body image <b>self-reflection</b> <b>task.</b> Among both groups, whole-brain analysis revealed activations of a brain network related to perceptive and affective components of body image processing. ROI analysis showed a main effect of group in ACC as well as a group by condition interaction within bilateral EBA, bilateral FBA, right IPL, bilateral DLPFC, left amygdala and left MPFC. For the A-W group, simple effect analysis revealed stronger activations in Thin-Control compared to Fat-Control condition within regions related to perceptive (including bilateral EBA, bilateral FBA, right IPL) and affective components of body image processing (including bilateral DLPFC, left amygdala), as well as self-reference (left MPFC). The O-W group only showed stronger activations in Fat-Control than in Thin-Control condition within regions related to the perceptive component of body image processing (including left EBA and left FBA). Path analysis showed that in the Fat-Thin contrast, body dissatisfaction completely mediated the group difference in brain response in left amygdala across the whole sample. Our data are the first to demonstrate differences in brain response to body pictures between average weight and overweight young females involved in a body image <b>self-reflection</b> <b>task.</b> These results provide insights for understanding the vulnerability to body image distress among overweight or obese young females...|$|R
40|$|Three {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to determine if goal striving level was related to accurate self-knowledge. The purpose of the research {{was to determine if}} the tendency of high strivers to confront stressful stimuli extends to self-evaluation processes. Three experiments were designed to investigate whether high strivers differ from low strivers in their inquires about possession of certain personality traits. It was reasoned that high strivers would choose more diagnostic questions in their quest for self-understanding. Study 1 tested the relationship between striving level and choice of diagnostic information. Self-esteem was measured as a moderating variable. Studies 2 and 3 also examined the relationship between striving and information preference; in addition, the motives underlying the self-evaluation process for high and low strivers are explored. Participants (N= 106) first generated personal striving lists and then responded on a <b>self-reflection</b> <b>task</b> in which they selected questions about traits that varied in degree of diagnosticity.

40|$|Self-reflection is {{commonly}} employed in postgraduate psychology training and forms {{part of their}} core competencies; however, self-reflection around cognitive assessment is limited. Data from 31 postgraduate students enrolled in either a Masters of Clinical Psychology (MCP; n= 21) or Professional Psychology (MPP; n= 10) were collated. Their performance on a video recorded administration of the WISC-IV was coded {{for the number of}} administration errors. Some students from both programs completed a <b>self-reflection</b> <b>task</b> (n= 16) prior to submission. There was no significant interaction between program type and reflection group. A significant main effect was observed for program type, with MCP students (M= 7. 77, SD= 5. 50) making fewer mistakes than MPP students (M= 15. 20, SD= 10. 83), F(1, 27) = 10. 70, p=. 003, d=. 90. A significant main effect was also observed for reflection group, with those who engaged in self-reflection (M= 7. 75, SD= 7. 04) making fewer mistakes than those did not (M= 12. 80, SD= 8. 81), F(1, 27) = 8. 24, p=. 008, d=. 63.

40|$|Objective: The Cortical Midline Structures (CMS) play a {{critical}} role in self-reflection, together with the insula. Abnormalities in self-referential processing and its neural underpinnings have been reported in schizophrenia and at-risk populations, suggesting they might be markers of psychotic vulnerability. Psycho-metric measures of schizotypal traits may be used to index psychosis proneness (PP) in nonclinical samples. It remains an unresolved question whether differences in self-reflective processing are associated with PP. Method: Six hundred students completed the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences Questionnaire, positive subscale. Two groups were formed from the extremes of the distribution (total N 36). fMRI was used to examine CMS/insula function during a <b>self-reflection</b> <b>task.</b> Participants judged personality trait sentences about self and about an acquaintance. Results: High PP subjects attributed less positive traits to others (i. e., acquaintances) than subjects with low PP. Across groups, the contrasts self semantic and self other induced activation in CMS and insula, whereas other semantic did not produce insula activation. Other self induced posterior cingulate cortex activation in low PP but not in high PP. In addition, high PP subjects showed stronger activation than low PP in left insula during self semantic. Examining valence effects revealed that high PP individuals showed increased activation in left insula, right dMPFC, and left vMPFC for positive self-related traits, and in bilateral insula, ACC, and right dMPFC for negative self-relate...|$|R
40|$|Background: Impaired insight is {{a common}} feature in {{psychosis}} and an important predictor of variables such as functional outcome, prognosis, and treatment adherence. A cognitive process that may underlie insight in psychosis is self-reflection, or the conscious evaluation of one's traits and characteristics. The current study aims to investigate the neural correlates of self-reflective processing and its relationship with insight in schizophrenia. Methods: Forty-seven schizophrenia patients and 21 healthy controls performed a <b>self-reflection</b> <b>task</b> in a {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) scanner. The <b>tasks</b> comprised a <b>self-reflection,</b> close other-reflection, and a semantic (baseline) condition. Insight scores were obtained with the Schedule of Assessment of Insight Expanded. In addition, cognitive insight scores were obtained (Beck Cognitive Insight Scale [BCIS]). Results: Schizophrenia patients demonstrated less activation in the posterior cingulate cortex in the self-and other-reflection conditions and less activation in the precuneus in the other-reflection condition compared with healthy controls. Better insight was associated with greater response in the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula, and inferior parietal lobule during self-reflection. In addition, better cognitive insight was associated with higher activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex during self-reflection. Conclusion: In the current study, evidence for a relationship between self-reflection and insight in patients with schizophrenia was found in brain areas related to self-reflection, self/other distinction and source attribution. The findings support the rationale for a treatment that is currently under evaluation, which attempts to increase insight by enhancing self-reflection. ...|$|R
40|$|Disturbances in {{implicit}} self-processing {{have been}} reported both in psychotic patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia. It remains unclear whether these two psychotic disorders show disturbed functional connectivity during explicit self-reflection, which is associated with social functioning and illness symptoms. Therefore, we investigated functional connectivity during explicit self-reflection in BD with past psychosis and schizophrenia. Twenty-three BD-patients, 17 schizophrenia-patients and 21 health controls (HC) performed a <b>self-reflection</b> <b>task,</b> including the conditions self-reflection, close other-reflection and semantic control. Functional connectivity was investigated with generalized psycho-physiological interaction (gPPI). During self-reflection compared to semantic, BD-patients had decreased connectivity between several cortical-midline structures (CMS) nodes (i. e., anterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex), the insula {{and the head of}} the caudate while HC showed increased connectivities. Schizophrenia-patients, during close other-reflection compared to semantic, demonstrated reduced ventral-anterior insula-precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) functional connectivity, whereas this was increased in HC. There were no differences between BD and schizophrenia during self- and close other-reflection. We propose that decreased functional connectivity between the CMS nodes/insula and head of the caudate in BD-patients may imply a reduced involvement of the motivational system during self-reflection; and the reduced functional connectivity between the ventral-anterior insula and precuneus/PCC during close other-reflection in schizophrenia-patients may subserve difficulties in information integration of autobiographical memory and emotional awareness in relation to close others. These distinctive impaired patterns of functional connectivity in BD and schizophrenia (compared to HC) deserve further investigation to determine their robustness and associations with differences in clinical presentation...|$|R
40|$|Impaired {{insight into}} illness, {{associated}} with worse treatment outcome, {{is common in}} schizophrenia. Insight has been related to the self-reflective processing, centred on the medial frontal cortex. We hypothesized that anatomical and functional routes {{to and from the}} ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) would differ in patients according to their degree of impaired insight. Forty-five schizophrenia patients and 19 healthy subjects performed a <b>self-reflection</b> <b>task</b> during fMRI, and underwent diffusion tensor imaging. Using dynamic causal modelling we observed increased effective connectivity from the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) towards the vmPFC with poorer insight and decrease from vmPFC to the IPL. Stronger connectivity from the PCC to vmPFC during judgment of traits related to self was associated with poorer insight. We found small-scale significant changes in white matter integrity associated with clinical insight. Self-reflection may be influenced by synaptic changes that lead to the observed alterations in functional connectivity accompanied by the small-scale but measurable alterations in anatomical connections. Our findings may point to a neural compensatory response to an impairment of connectivity between self-processing regions. Similarly, the observed hyper-connectivity might be a primary deficit linked to inefficiency in the component cognitive processes that lead to impaired insight. We suggest that the stronger cognitive demands placed on patients with poor insight is reflected in increased effective connectivity during the task in this study.

40|$|Objectives: Reflecting on {{the self}} and on others {{activates}} specific brain areas and contributes to metacognition and social cognition. The aim {{of the current study}} is to investigate brain activation during self- and other-reflection in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In addition, we examined whether potential abnormal brain activation in BD patients could distinguish BD from patients with schizophrenia (SZ). Methods: During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 17 BD patients, 17 SZ patients and 21 healthy controls (HCs) performed a <b>self-reflection</b> <b>task.</b> The task consisted of sentences divided into three conditions: self-reflection, other-reflection and semantic control. Results: BD patients showed less activation in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) extending to the precuneus during other-reflection compared to HCs (p =  0. 028 FWE corrected on cluster-level within the regions of interest). In SZ patients, the level of activation in this area was in between BD patients and HCs, with no significant differences between patients with SZ and BD. There were no group differences in brain activation during self-reflection. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the PCC/precuneus activation during other-reflection and cognitive insight in SZ patients, but not in BD patients. Conclusions: BD patients showed less activation in the PCC/precuneus during other-reflection. This may support an account of impaired integration of emotion and memory (evaluation of past and current other-related information) in BD patients. Correlation differences of the PCC/precuneus activation with the cognitive insight in patients with BD and SZ might reflect an important difference between these disorders, which may help to further explore potentially distinguishing markers...|$|R

40|$|Whereas {{cross-sectional}} {{research has}} shown that transformational leadership, task interdependence, and self-efficacy are positively related to teachers’ engagement in reflective learning activities, the causal direction of these relations needs further inquiry. At the same time, individual teacher learning might play a mutual role in strengthening school-level capacity for sustained improvement. Building on previous research, this longitudinal study therefore examines how transformational leadership, task interdependence, self-efficacy, and teachers’ engagement in self-reflection mutually affect each other over time. Questionnaire data gathered on three measurement occasions from 655 Dutch Vocational Education and Training teachers was analyzed using a multivariate Latent Difference Score model. Results indicate that <b>self-reflection</b> and <b>task</b> interdependence reciprocally influence each other’s change. A considerate and stimulating transformational leader was found to contribute to this process. Change in self-efficacy was influenced by self-reflection, indicating that learning leads to competency beliefs. Together, the findings point to the important role transformational leadership practices play in facilitating teamwork, and sustaining teachers’ levels of learning in school...|$|R
40|$|Past {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that individuals who adopt a psychologically immersed, as opposed to a psychologically distanced perspective when reflecting on negative emotional experiences, tend to experience greater negative affect and have more difficulty reappraising their experiences in an objective manner. Psychological distancing and immersion have not been studied systematically in socially anxious (SA) individuals, despite previous research showing that trait social anxiety is strongly associated with negatively biased appraisals of social experiences during self-reflection and post-event processing. The current study investigated the relationship between trait social anxiety, psychological immersion, and the cognitive and affective experiences of 76 participants while they engaged in a laboratory-based social task. Participants wrote about and reflected on a recent negative experience in which something they did or said in a social situation did not turn out the way they thought it should have. Thereafter, participants imagined an upcoming social interaction in which they believed they would be judged on their ability to impress a social partner. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two conditions in which they were instructed to self-reflect on these experiences in a distanced or immersed manner. Participants completed self-report measures of affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule), subjective distress (SUDS), cognitions (Negative Self Portrayal Scale), and psychological immersion (Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire) at several time points during the study. Although there were no significant effects of condition in the primary analyses, secondary analyses demonstrated that psychological immersion was significantly correlated with higher negative and lower positive affect, and with greater self portrayal concerns (but only for the social anticipation task), accounting for unique and significant variance in these outcomes, over and above the variance accounted for by trait SA. Moreover, there was a significant interaction between psychological distancing and SA status during the social anticipation <b>self-reflection</b> <b>task,</b> such that high SA participants experienced significantly greater negative affect than their low SA counterparts, but only at high levels of self-immersion. At low levels of self-immersion, both high and low SA participants reported comparatively low levels of negative affect. These results suggest that individual differences in psychological immersion and distancing may help to explain the circumstances under which self-reflection could have detrimental affective and cognitive consequences. In particular, high levels of self-immersion during self-reflection appear to interact with high levels of trait SA to drive negative emotional responses and beliefs within social contexts. Implications of these preliminary findings, their limitations, and ideas for future research are discussed within the context of cognitive behavioural models of SA...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purposes}} of this study aimed to study and compare the undergraduates’ English learning techniques and English learning strategies among four skills; listening, speaking, reading and writing in a high achievement group and a low achievement group in phase one and to study the results of using the English learning techniques in a low achievement group in phase two. The research instruments employed at each phase were the English learning techniques and strategies questionnaire, the semi- structured interview form, the behavioural observation form, the <b>self-reflection</b> form and <b>task</b> evaluation form. The findings revealed that the undergraduates in a high achievement group and a low achievement group used the different English learning techniques but the similar English learning strategies. The high achievement group; however, performed better in English skills than the low achievement group because of the duration of their practices and the concentration for academic purposes. Moreover, the results of using English learning techniques in the low achievement group demonstrated that the students had better English learning behaviours and obtained a very good level from task assessment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{appealing to}} learners' moral identity makes {{a significant contribution}} to improving their ethical decision making beyond traditional, rule-based teaching. In response to criticisms leveled at rule-based ethics teaching by alternative approaches, we identify moral identity theory and experiments in moral psychology as useful sources to draw on {{for the creation of a}} new, identity-based ethics teaching approach. We develop and apply a set of regular <b>self-reflection</b> focused writing <b>tasks</b> added to the traditional teaching program over a one-semester period, and assess the outcomes of an overall sample of 149 postgraduate business school students, who were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: exposure to both identity-based tasks and rule-based teaching, exposure to rule-based teaching only, and the control condition (i. e., no exposure to ethics teaching). Our findings show that, while the three groups reported the same level of ethical decision making at the beginning of the semester, at the end of the semester the students who were exposed to both identity-based and rule-based teaching reported higher level of ethical decision making compared to those who were only exposed to rule-based education. In addition, the students who received rule-based teaching reported higher ethical decision making compared to those in the control condition. These results suggest that a teaching approach which appeals to the learner's moral identity can act as an effective leverage point when complementing rule-based teaching. This simple approach should be widely adopted as common practice in graduate business schools...|$|R
40|$|Background Deficits {{in social}} cognition, {{including}} impairments in self-awareness, {{contribute to the}} overall functional disability associated with schizophrenia. Studies in healthy subjects have shown that social cognitive functions, including self-reflection, rely on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate gyrus, and these regions exhibit highly correlated activity during “resting” states. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that patients with schizophrenia show dysfunction of this network during self-reflection and that this abnormal activity is associated with changes in the strength of resting-state correlations between these regions. Methods Activation during <b>self-reflection</b> and control <b>tasks</b> was measured with {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} in 19 patients with schizophrenia and 20 demographically matched control subjects. In addition, the resting-state functional connectivity of midline cortical areas showing abnormal self-reflection-related activation in schizophrenia was measured. Results Compared with control subjects, the schizophrenia patients demonstrated lower activation of the right ventral mPFC and greater activation of the mid/posterior cingulate gyri bilaterally during self-reflection, relative to a control task. A similar pattern was seen during overall social reflection. In addition, functional connectivity between the portion of the left mid/posterior cingulate gyrus showing abnormally elevated activity during self-reflection in schizophrenia, and the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus was lower in the schizophrenia patients compared with control subjects. Conclusions Schizophrenia is associated with an anterior-to-posterior shift in introspection-related activation, as well as changes in functional connectivity, of the midline cortex. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that aberrant midline cortical function contributes to social cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.
