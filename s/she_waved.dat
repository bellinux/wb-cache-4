500|$|Critics {{were divided}} in their {{opinions}} {{for the music}} video. In a more favorable review, Zayda Rivera of Daily News stated that Cyrus is [...] "undoubtedly {{the star of the}} video" [...] and that the [...] "ultimate cameo takes place when Cyrus brings back the infamous foam finger <b>she</b> <b>waved</b> and gyrated against during her MTV Video Music Awards performance". Ray Rahman from Entertainment Weekly recognized the prominent 1990s influence throughout the clip, and felt it was [...] "reminiscent" [...] to the visuals for [...] "Make 'Em Say Uhh!" [...] by Master P. In a more critical review, Carl Williott of Idolator opined that the music video was [...] "sort of like a massive hip-hop version of the [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] video, with Air Jordans and Beats instead of anarchy symbols", while Kayla Upadhyaya from The Michigan Daily called it a [...] "pile of red and black vomit and a poorly edited mishmash of uninspired shots".|$|E
500|$|The show {{began with}} a dance {{introduction}} by Spears' dancers among smoke effects. She appeared shortly after {{at the top of}} the staircase wearing a hot pink vinyl tube top and white vinyl pants with pink knee patches, to perform [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy". In [...] "Soda Pop" [...] she danced and interacted with the audience, before leaving the stage while her dancers continued. She appeared sitting on the staircase to sing [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] and [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart". The show continued with a dance interlude set to Madonna's [...] "Vogue" [...] in which she named Madonna and Janet Jackson as her biggest inspirations. She then took the stage to perform a cover of Madonna's [...] "Material Girl". After this, she performed two covers of Janet Jackson songs, [...] "Black Cat" [...] and [...] "Nasty". She ended the section with a performance of Sonny & Cher's [...] "The Beat Goes On", accompanied by psychedelic lights. After a dance interlude, she performed the album track [...] "I Will Be There" [...] and a cover of [...] "Open Arms" [...] by Journey, ending with a smile {{at the top of the}} staircase. After [...] "Sometimes", <b>she</b> <b>waved</b> and left the stage. The encore consisted of a performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time", in which Spears wore a black bra under pink halter, a pink sequined plaid mini-skirt, and black thigh-high stockings. She then thanks the audience and leaves the stage.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 29, 1910. It states: [...] "Marie is the tiny daughter of a well to do farmer. On Halloween her father, to amuse her, picks a pumpkin that she selects, and fashions a jack-o-lantern out of it. Her new toy pleases the child immensely, and at once takes a place in her affections equal to that held by her dollie. So it is natural {{that she should be}} thinking about the two of them when she is tucked into bed and falls asleep. Perhaps that was why the queen of the fairies came to her and invited her to a Halloween party that her loyal subjects were giving in their woodland retreat. And so that Marie would be perfectly happy, not feel embarrassed among strangers, the queen asked Dollie and Pumpkin to be her guests also. And, as a further mark of favor, <b>she</b> <b>waved</b> her hand, and Dollie and Pumpkin could run around and talk as well as Marie could. It certainly made it more enjoyable for the little girl. A fairy Halloween party is one of the finest things going in the amusement line, and only very nice and very good little girls are invited to them. As Marie filled these requirements, she had a perfectly glorious time, but was inclined to weep when she woke up later in her own little bed, and found that her toys had lost their miraculous gift of life. But it consoled her somewhat to have them, for they served as reminders of her wonderful evening. And perhaps the fairies will ask her to attend another party later. If they do, she has decided that Pumpkin and Dollie must have their shares of the good times as before." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, while {{promoting}} her eighth studio album Damita Jo, Jackson made surprise {{performances of}} [...] "Together Again" [...] and [...] "All Nite (Don't Stop)" [...] at New York's Gay Pride March. [...] "Together Again" [...] {{was one of}} her older songs on the 2008 Rock Witchu Tour, her first tour in seven years. It was at the middle of the setlist. She was dressed in a gold and black glam hip hop-inspired track suit, and one gold glove. Variety magazine's Phil Gallo likened her vocals in the song to that of Diana Ross's. Rap-Up noted the audience [...] "went wild" [...] during the song. While reviewing the Vancouver concert, Marsha Lederman of Globe and Mail noted that the most memorable moment of the show was when Jackson [...] "stopped on the catwalk after her hit Together Again, listened to the crowd roar its approval, and became emotional – really emotional. We're talking tears. 'Thank you,' she said – seeming to really mean it, as <b>she</b> <b>waved</b> her hands, begging the audience to stop", she completed. While promoting her second greatest hits album Number Ones, the singer performed an eight-minute medley of six hits during the American Music Awards of 2009. It included [...] "Control", [...] "Miss You Much", [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", [...] "If", [...] "Make Me", and finished with [...] "Together Again". For the latter's performance, Jackson stood alone at center stage, smiling, as the received applauses and standing ovation from the audience. It also was the closing song of her concert at Essence Music Festival in New Orleans, in July 2010, which she headlined. [...] "Together Again" [...] was again performed as a closing number on her [...] 2011 tour as a dedication to her late brother, Michael Jackson, wearing a tight white one-piece disco suit. MTV News' writer Vaughn Schoonmaker noted that the song appeared to be the biggest hit of the show. Jackson also included the song on her 2015-16 Unbreakable World Tour. Writing for the Hartford Courant, Thomas Kintner pointed out that [...] "A finale of 'Together Again', offered as a simple tribute that recalled her brother again, proved the evening's highlight, a relaxed trip through the sort of juicy pop Jackson has stockpiled throughout her career, and which still charms when she lets it run". The song is also included on the 2017 State of the World Tour.|$|E
