A new {{improved}} multidiscipline feasible (MDF) strategy {{based on}} the updating approximate function constructed by Response Surface Method (RSM) is firstly pointed out and denoted as MDF-update-RSM which involves double cycles. Before the start of inner loop on MDF-update-RSM strategy, the approximate function is initialized by RSM {{on a set of}} sampling points which are generated from the Design of Experiment (DOE). With the process of outer loop, the coefficients and one high-order term of polynomial are updated and upgrade by the Least Square Regression. The ability of this new strategy promotes the efficiency and saves huge calculational cost incurred by the MDF strategy which always runs on the multidisciplinary analysis (MDA).

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{prospects of}} using blisks with <b>shrouded</b> <b>blades.</b> Increasing an engine life and efficiency {{as well as}} mass reduction can also be achieved by increasing blade numbers and decreasing disk diameter. But design engineers {{are faced with the}} problem of blade placement because of the disk size and root dimensions. The problem of increasing life and cyclic durability, vibration strength, and lightweight design of the turbine gas turbine wheels, can be solved by an elimination of blade - disk locks. The technology of manufacturing one-piece blisks by connecting the blades with the disc part using hot isostatic pressing was developed. This technology allows us to use <b>blades</b> with <b>shrouds.</b> It is necessary to increase efficiency and to improve high cycle fatigue performance of rotor blades. One of the pressing problems is to ensure the necessary position of shrouds in relation {{to each other in the}} manufacturing process as well as in the service. Numerical studies of the influence of the shroud mounting position on blade strength during operation allowed us to develop a methodology of choosing a shroud mounting position. Based on the two turbine wheels (LPT and HPT) calculations advantages of blisk design with respect to the lock-based design were shown. Application of bimetallic blisks with <b>shrouded</b> <b>blades</b> resulted in a lifespan increase and weight reduction. In addition, other advantages of blisk design are as follows: possible reduction in the number of parts, elimination of leaks and fretting that take place in the blade - disk locks, exception of expensive broaching operations and disk alloy saving. The shortcoming is elimination of damping in root connection. In addition, there are no widely used repair methods. Despite these disadvantages the usage of bimetallic turbine blisks with <b>shrouded</b> <b>blades</b> is very promising. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the mode localization phenomenon associated with mistuning is presented for <b>shrouded</b> <b>blade</b> assemblies. The calculations {{are based on a}} generic finite element model, which permits modeling of arbitrary mistuning and both slipping and nonslipping shroud interfaces. The results presented indicate that interactions occur between mistuning and slip effects, with maximum mode localization occurring when the shrouds slip freely. Certain modes are found to be very sensitive to shroud slip, and in some cases completely change character when slip occurs. Mode localization is most pronounced in the predominantly bending modes, and varies considerably from mode to mode. As the ratio of interblade coupling strength to mistuning strength is increased, the effect of mistuning is observed to decrease significantly. This result has important implications for the flutter problem, since it suggests that the stabilization effect available from mistuning is significantly less for a shrouded rotor as compared to an unshrouded rotor...|$|E

40|$|A {{statistical}} {{investigation of}} the effects of uncertainty in root fixity on the free vibration of turbine blades is made. Emphasis is particularly placed on the statistical properties of the random eigenvalues and essentially on their standard deviations. These are evaluated using the direct product technique between matrices [1] and validated by Monte Carlo SImulations (MCS). The studied system is a simplified model of a <b>shrouded</b> <b>blade</b> assembly under the conditions of weak interblade coupling. It essentially consists of a cyclic chain of continuous beams with identical properties, fixed at one end via rotational springs with random stiffnesses representing the uncertain roots stiffnesses and coupled via linear springs at their tips. Finite Element Method is used as a discretization technique to obtain the equations of motion of the tuned and mistuned systems and the corresponding random eigenvalue problem. Numerical simulations show that small differences between the rotational springs stiffnesses spolit the natural frequencies that were in pairs, increase the width of each frequency-cluster and strongly localizes the vibration around one blade. This strong localization has been shown to occur in a chain of single-degree-of-freedom, nearly identical, coupled oscillators if the coupling frequency between the subsystems is of order of, or smaller than the spread in the natural frequencies [2] However, for the multi-degree-of-freedom and randomly mistuned system considered her, multiple realizations are required to capture the behaviour of the eigenvalues appearing in frequency-clusters. It is found that for each frequency-cluster, when the standard deviations of theeigenvalues are plotted against the mode number, they form a U-shaped curve. For the particular case when the coupling frequency line crosses a curve, this essentially shows that the vibration localization is stronger at the first and last modes than at the mid frequencies, which belong to one passband in the tuned system...|$|E

Finally the two <b>shrouded</b> turbine rotor <b>blades</b> with 2 mm z-gap between the shrouds are created and analyzed using the same procedure and the pressure coefficient was compared with the reference pressure coefficient profile and found that decrease in the pressure coefficient on the blade surface near the shroud is because of the leakage of flow through the z-gap between the shrouds.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{reported in this}} dissertation aims to provide computational methodologies and to further the understanding of physical phenomena that will aid and improve the design of bladed disk assemblies from a structural dynamics standpoint. Bladed disk structures are found in {{a wide array of}} applications, including small impeller pumps andautomotive turbo systems; large gas, steam, and hydro turbines for power generation; and jet engines for military and commercial aircraft propulsion. Based on the nominal design, a bladed disk assembly is a rotationally periodic structure. If it is assumed that each disk-blade sector is identical, then the theory of cyclic symmetry may be used to analyze the dynamics of the entire structure based on one fundamental disk-blade sector. In practice, however, there are always small differences among the structural properties of individual blades, which destroy the cyclic symmetry of the bladed disk assembly. These structural irregularities, commonly referred to as mistuning, may derive from manufacturing tolerances, deviations in material properties, or non-uniform operational wear. Mistuning is known to have a potentially dramatic effect on the vibratory behavior of the rotor, since it can lead to spatial localization of the vibration energy. Spatial localization implies that the vibration energy in a bladed disk becomes confined to one or a few blades rather than being uniformly distributed throughout the system. This phenomenon may be explained by viewing the vibration energy of the system as a circumferentially traveling wave. In a perfectly tuned system, the wave propagates through each identical disk-blade sector, yielding uniform vibration amplitudes that differ only in phase. In the mistuned case, however, the structural irregularities may cause the traveling wave to be partially reflected at each sector. This can lead to confinement of vibration energy to a small region of the assembly. As a result, certain blades may experience forced response amplitudes and stresses that are substantially larger than those predicted by an analysis of the nominal design. Hence, certain blades may exhibit much shorter lifespans than would be predicted by a fatigue life assessment based on the nominal assembly. In order to address this concern, some efficient computational methods have been developed that can predict the effects of mistuning on the vibratory response of a turbomachinery rotor stage. Furthermore, these techniques enable analyses of large numbers of randomly mistuned bladed disks in order to estimate the mistuned forced response statistics for a rotor design. However, at the outset of this research effort, no methods possessed the combination of accuracy and computational efficiency required to allow reliable statistical assessments of mistuning sensitivity to be included {{as an integral part of}} the turbomachinery rotor design process. Motivated by the turbomachinery community's need for practical design tools that incorporate mistuning effects, three distinct objectives are identified and addressed in this research effort: 1 - To develop highly efficient and accurate reduced order modeling techniques for the free and forced response of tuned and mistuned bladed disks, based on parent finite element representations of arbitrary complexity and detail in a consistent and systematic fashion. 2 - To broaden the scope of these reduced order modeling techniques by establishing linearized formulations for <b>shrouded</b> <b>blade</b> designs. 3 - To increase the understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms of the mistuning phenomenon, with particular emphasis on the role of disk flexibility and structural stage-to-stage coupling in determining a design's sensitivity to mistuning, leading to formulations for multi-stage synthesis and analysis. Cette thèse s'intéresse à la mise en œuvre de modèles réduits de roues aubagées de moteurs d'avion sujettes au désaccordement.

40|$|Actual {{trend in}} steam turbine design {{is to use}} <b>blades</b> with {{integral}} <b>shrouds,</b> for high pressure and intermediate pressure steam turbine sections, as well as sometimes also for the long blades of the low pressure sections. The blades are either inserted with their root into the seat on the shaft {{in such a way}} that small clearances remain between adjacent <b>blade</b> <b>shrouds,</b> so that the relative vibration amplitude is restricted by the contact between adjacent shrouds. This mechanism is called “snubbing mechanism”. Another technology for mounting blades on the shaft is to do it {{in such a way that}} the blades are slightly forced against each other in correspondence of the shrouds: this should allow the continuity of the contact without clearances also at rated speed and full load. In this case the blades are called “pre-twisted”. Field experience has shown that these kinds of blade rows has a “robust and smooth” behavior.

This work is focused on coatings applied on the Z-notches of turbine <b>shrouded</b> <b>blades</b> in order to minimize the damage due to fretting wear.

40|$|The Blade Tip-Timing is a {{well-known}} non-contact measurement technique currently employed for {{the identification of the}} dynamic behaviours of rotating bladed disks. Although the measurement system has become a typical industry equipment for bladed disks vibration surveys, the type of sensors, the positioning of the sensors around the bladed disk and the used algorithm for data post-processing are still not standard techniques, and their reliability has to be proved for different operation conditions by the comparison with other well-established measurement techniques used as reference like strain gauges. This paper aims at evaluating the accuracy of a latest generation Tip-Timing system on two dummy blisks characterized by different geometrical, structural and dynamical properties. Both disks are tested into a spin-rig where a fixed number of permanent magnets excite synchronous vibrations with respect to the rotor speed.

Chordwise flexibility is {{found to have a}} significant effect on the unstalled supersonic flutter of low aspect ratio blades, and also on the stability of tip sections of <b>shrouded</b> fan <b>blades.</b> For blades with a thickness of less than approximately four percent of chord, the chordwise, second bending, and first torsion branches are all unstable at moderately high supersonic Mach numbers. For composite blades, the important structural coupling between bending and torsion cannot be modeled properly unless chordwise bending is accounted for. Typically, aft fiber sweep produces beneficial bending-torsion coupling that is stabilizing, whereas forward fiber sweep has the opposite effect. By using crossed-ply laminate configurations, critical aeroelastic modes can be stabilized...|$|R
40|$|Many natural gas-fuelled {{power plants}} will be {{situated}} {{close to the}} sea, where salt spray can result in fouling of compressors, and even hot salt corrosion of the turbine blading. This investigative work was carried out on corroded nimonic 108 blades, from one of British Gas's RB 211 engines. It showed that the turbines had been running at too high temperature. This combined with the salt, had caused rapid corrosion of the leading edges and <b>blade</b> <b>shrouds.</b> Alterations to operating procedures, and the recommendation of more resistant coatings has alleviated the problem...|$|R
40|$|A {{general purpose}} design {{methodology}} for high pressure ratio centrifugal compressor was developed. This includes realistic flow models and loss correlations. New analytic functions were evolved to define optimized blade geometry. Theoretical methods were developed {{and used to}} analyze the flow in the hub to <b>shroud</b> and <b>blade</b> to blade surfaces. A methodology was developed for estimating the simulated performance of the impeller in different mediums. Two different designs of impeller were chosen and fabricated for design validation. One of these impeller was tested in Closed Circuit Centrifugal compressor test rig(CLOCTER) for its performance. A pressure ratio of 6 : 1 with an impeller total to total peak efficiency of about 88 % was achieved. This work was carried out at Propulsion Division,National Aerospace Laboratory,Bangalore- 17 under a grant-in-aid project entitled "Aerodynamic Investigation of High pressure Ratio Centrifugal Compressor" funded by Aeronautical Research and Development Board. This project yielded useful data for the generation of design know-how and technology development for high pressure ratio centrifugal compressors...|$|R
40|$|Gas turbine {{compressor}} and {{turbine blade}} tip clearance (i. e., the radial {{distance between the}} blade tip of an axial compressor or turbine and the containment structure) is a major contributing factor to gas path sealing, and can significantly affect engine efficiency and operational temperature. This paper details {{the creation of a}} generic but realistic high pressure turbine tip clearance model that may be used to facilitate active tip clearance control system research. This model uses a first principles approach to approximate thermal and mechanical deformations of the turbine system, taking into account the rotor, <b>shroud,</b> and <b>blade</b> tip components. Validation of the tip clearance model shows that the results are realistic and reflect values found in literature. In addition, this model has been integrated with a gas turbine engine simulation, creating a platform to explore engine performance as tip clearance is adjusted. Results from the integrated model explore the effects of tip clearance on engine operation and highlight advantages of tip clearance management...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} types of analytic functions have been evolved to define the centrifugal impeller geometry. A parameter called wrap angle was used in these analytic functions to vary the impeller blade shape. The relative advantages of one analytic function over the other is highlighted by comparing the blade geometry, channel area variation and derivatives of important geometric parameters affecting the flow. The impellers generated from the evolved analytic equations were theoretically analyed for hub to <b>shroud</b> and <b>blade</b> to blade flows. The performance of the impellers were compared from the aspects of boundary layer parameter and blade loading. First and second analytic functions for large wrap angles and only first analytic function for small wrap angles were found suitable to define the blade geometry. For large axial lengths impeller having small wrap angle was found advantageous. Wrap angles of the order slightly greater than the fluid deflection were found advantageous from the aspect of derivatives of important geometric parameters...|$|R
