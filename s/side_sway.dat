40|$|The Capacity Design method (CDM) {{is a well}} {{accepted}} design {{procedure for}} earthquake resistant design. CDM employs strong column-weak beam design philosophy. The failure mechanism expected in the CDM is the so called <b>Side</b> <b>Sway</b> Mechanism. To ensure that the <b>side</b> <b>sway</b> mechanism can develop, the columns should be designed stronger than {{the capacity of the}} beams. In the cases of gravity load dominated structures, forcing the column to be stronger than the beams will lead to excessive column strength. Applying CDM also implies that the columns can not be designed before the beams are designed. Hence, this is not very practical in real world of design practice. To overcome these shortcomings, the authors investigate several alternatives allowing partial <b>side</b> <b>sway</b> mechanism, in which the internal columns are allowed to develop plastic hinge while the perimeter columns are to remain elastic for a certain seismic load level except {{at the base of the}} structure. To ensure that the perimeter columns remain elastic, these perimeter columns are designed to resist magnified internal forces due to the nominal earthquake load multiplied by a certain magnification factor, f. This method is called the Partial Capacity Design Method (PCDM). Several efforts have been made to find the suitable magnification factor. In the latest development the determination of the magnification factor is based on the natural period of the structure in plastic condition, the plastic period. The plastic period, Tpl is predicted using a correlation between the elastic and plastic natural period developed from data of several structures previously observed. This paper describes the basic concepts of the CPDM and shows the performance of several symmetrical fully ductile concrete moment resisting frames designed in accordance with the latest Indonesian Seismic Code (SNI 03 1726 - 2002) using the proposed method.

In this study, we assessed the potential use of GF- 1 WFV (Wild Field Camera), ZY- 3 MUX (Multi-spectral camera), and HJ- 1 CCD (Charge Coupled Device) sensor data for grassland monitoring by comparing spectral field measurements, vegetation coverage, and the leaf area index (LAI) of grassland stands with reflectance in the red and near-infrared bands and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Based on spectral field measurements, the characteristic differences of spectral response functions of the sensors were analyzed. Based on simulations using the SAIL bidirectional canopy reflectance model coupled with the PROSPECT leaf optical properties model (PROSAIL), we investigated the effects {{of changes in the}} sensorsâ zenith angle caused by <b>side</b> <b>sway.</b> The following conclusions were drawn. (1) Differences in the adjusted coefficients of determination (R 2) exist when comparing correlations between the reflectances from the three sensor types in different bands. The values of R 2 are 0. 556 â 0. 893 and 0. 819 â 0. 850 for the infrared and red bands, respectively, and these data show a better correlation for the red band than for the infrared band. Fitted slope equations revealed inconsistencies in the data between the different sensor types. In the red band, GF- 1 WFV and HJ- 1 CCD data are the most consistent, but in the near-infrared band, GF- 1 WFV and ZY- 3 MUX data are the most consistent; (2) The correlation of NDVIs obtained from the different sensor types is high (R 2 between 0. 758 and 0. 852); however, the consistency is low in that the NDVI based on GF- 1 WFV data is significantly higher than that based on ZY- 3 MUX and HJ- 1 CCD data. In contrast, the mean difference is small between the NDVIs based on ZY- 3 MUX and HJ- 1 CCD; (3) Correlation analysis between ground grass-coverage and measured LAI data shows that the three sensor types are better at estimating coverage than the LAI, and that the GF- 1 WFV sensor gave the best performance; (4) Changes in the sensorsâ zenith angle caused by <b>side</b> <b>sway</b> were proven to have greater impact on reflectance and NDVI than the spectral response function; (5) For LAI values of 0 â 3, the NDVI changes significantly with increasing LAI, and differences between the three sensor types are obvious.

40|$|Rollover crashes {{have been}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of}} the most dangerous forms of passenger vehicle crashes (NHTSA, 2006 b). The detailed review of the research literature presented in Chapter 2 and cited throughout this thesis, has identified rollover to be a significant social issue in both the US and Australia due to the high proportion of road fatalities and serious injuries this crash mode accounts for. These findings are evidence of an inherent lack of adequate rollover crashworthiness design in modern day vehicles, which in turn has led to a low degree of occupant protection and the high serious injury and fatality rates observed in these crashes. The literature review also identified that a significant number of injuries result from occupants being ejected. While researchers have demonstrated a good understanding of how to prevent such ejections, and therefore the resulting injuries, there remains conflict and confusion when research focus turns to the serious and fatal injuries of contained occupants, particularly when considering spinal neck injuries. This conflict is primarily a result of a series of differing findings of researchers regarding the cause of these injuries. These conflicting findings result from the development of two seemingly contradictory theories which attempt to explain how spinal neck injury is inflicted on contained occupants during rollovers. This has in turn confused opinions on the best method to improve the rollover crashworthiness design of vehicles for close to forty years. As a result, the number and proportion of rollover fatalities has remained high in Australia, and in the US has increased from the mid- 1980 s to today. Driven by the need for a consistent philosophy underpinned by strong scientific evidence, the research presented in this thesis was aimed at better understanding the injury mechanisms, particularly spinal neck injury mechanisms, which lead to fatalities and serious injuries. This was seen as vital to any improvement in the rollover crashworthiness design of vehicles. To this end, the research presented within this thesis focused on answering three key research questions: 1. What are the injury mechanisms for contained and seat-belted occupants in rollover crashes? 2. Does roof deformation caused by the structural failure of a weak roof lead to severe and/or fatal spinal neck injury to contained and seat-belted occupants? 3. What key components of a vehicleâs roof must be considered when designing a vehicle that protects itâs occupants against a severe spinal neck injury during a rollover crash? From these research questions, the following research hypotheses are developed as a further guide for the work presented. - There is a causal link between the severe and fatal spinal neck injuries of contained and seat-belted occupants of a rollover crash and the strength of a vehicleâs roof; - The mechanism of roof deformation that occurs during a passenger vehicle rollover crash influences the severity of spinal neck injury a contained and seat-belted occupant is subjected to. Chapter 3 presents a review of Australian road crash data and identifies that rollovers in Australia accounted for 24 % of all passenger vehicle road fatalities for 2004 and 2005, a higher proportion than had been identified in previous research. Importantly, the rollover crash mode accounted for a higher proportion of crashes than either front or side impact vehicle-to-vehicle crashes. The Chapter 3 review of road crashes concludes that the injury profiles and injury mechanisms leading to fatalities on Australian roads, for the years investigated, were similar to those reported in previous US investigations. This in turn leads to the finding that similar limitations in vehicle design are evident in the vehicle fleet in both countries. This is true despite the fact that US road users are thought to be adequately protected by a mandatory rollover standard, namely FMVSS 216. This then also leads to the conclusion that this standard is ineffective in protecting passenger vehicle occupants during rollovers. To address the underlying conflict regarding the causation of those spinal neck injuries observed to occur to contained and seat-belted occupants in rollover crashes, the research presented in Chapter 4 focuses on identifying and comparing the different roof deformation mechanisms where these injuries occur. Some of these roof mechanisms are identified through the review of previous research while others are original, in that this thesis is the first to identify and examine in detail these mechanisms. In all, five mechanisms are identified and discussed: - Diving (which significantly is directly related to occupant/vehicle kinematics rather than the degree of roof deformation), - âProgressive waveâ roof buckle, - Roof <b>side</b> <b>sway</b> âmatch-boxingâ, - Roof âinward foldâ, and - Roof âoutward tentingâ. Using video footage of the Malibu II rollover crash tests, carried out by General Motors (GM), it was identified that the diving mechanism (Moffatt 1975) does indeed occur in both strong and weak roof vehicles. Further, it is shown that the severity of impact to an occupant during the diving mechanism is related to the kinematics of the vehicle and the movement of the occupant within the vehicle throughout the rollover event. Using the Malibu II crash tests, it is shown that the maximum head impact velocity reaches around 2. 0 to 3. 0 m/sec, when considering the diving mechanism. Through further analysis of the Malibu II rollover crash test footage the remaining mechanisms, each of which involves different forms of roof deformation due to structural failure, are each shown to be associated with a potential for head impact velocities greater than 3. 0 m/sec. Using the analysis of the roof deformation and the recorded results of the Hybrid III Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) used during the Malibu II rollover crash test series, it is concluded that structural failure(s) and the resulting roof deformation, lead to an increased risk of severe and fatal spinal neck injury for contained and seat-belted occupants. Chapter 5 extends the work of Chapter 4 by identifying and discussing real world rollover crash cases where the roof mechanisms introduced in Chapter 4 can be identified and the injuries to contained occupants exposed to these mechanisms. Two studies are presented, the first being a review of Australian single vehicle fatal rollover crashes involving contained occupants and the second being a review of US single vehicle rollover crashes involving contained occupants that recorded all levels of injury severity. These studies lead to a series of important findings. These include that: all but one of the mechanisms identified in Chapter 4 could be observed from post crash photos of vehicles that had rolled over; in the case of strong roof vehicles (defined as vehicle with a FMVSS Strength-to-vehicle Weight Ratio > 4. 0) where occupants are most likely to be subjected to the diving mechanism, there are no occupants that sustained fatal injuries; severe (AIS 3 +) injuries to the head and neck were more prevalent in crashes where structural failure of the vehicleâs pillars and header (i. e. roof structure) was observed; lower frequency of injury to the head and spinal neck is observed for high roof strength vehicles in the US; occupants seated on the front far-side of the vehicle demonstrate those characteristics (considering injury profile and frequency) of those occupants who are contained and killed in fatal rollover crashes; and finally a lower frequency of structural failure of pillars is concluded to lead to an increased level of protection for contained and seat-belted occupantâs, as observed in rollover crashes involving high roof strength vehicles. Chapter 6 analyses the Hybrid III ATD results from the Malibu II series of FMVSS 208 dolly rollover crash tests, as they relate to occupant neck injury risk. As a precursor to this, an investigation and review of the neck loading process including theoretical analyses and computer modeling of inverted drop test experiments involving Hybrid III ATDs are presented. The work also identifies that spinal neck injury risk as measured by such an ATD is directly related to the head impact velocity to which the ATD was subjected. Through an investigation examining cadaver test data, Chapter 6 also identified a series of spinal neck risk relationships. These risk relationships can be related either to the velocity, momentum or kinetic energy of the head impact. The strength of the relationship between each injury risk variable and cadaver neck fracture is identified and from this it is shown that the variable which demonstrated the relationship of highest strength is head impact momentum. These results show that an increase in intrusion velocity, such as that observed when structural failures occur in vehicle roofs, increases the risk of severe spinal neck injury for contained occupants. Chapter 6 then presents a comparison of spinal neck injury risks for all Potentially Injurious Impacts (defined by Orlowski et al. 1985) recorded by the Hybrid III ATDs during the Malibu II rollover crash tests. ATD-measured spinal neck injury risks are identified using the risk relationships established for head impact velocity, momentum and kinetic energy as well as the risk relationship identified by the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administrationâs (NHTSA), i. e. the Neck Injury Criterion (NIC). It is shown that ATDs in the un-reinforced (production) roof vehicles record higher average and peak spinal neck injury risks than ATDs in the reinforced roof vehicles. This trend is observed using all injury risk measures, indicating an increased serious injury risk for contained and seat-belted occupants of low roof strength vehicles. To complete the investigation of Chapter 6, an analysis of the two PIIs demonstrating the highest spinal neck injury risk, for both strengthened and production roof vehicles, is presented. These PIIs are 5 R 3 (strengthened) and 7 L 4 (production). A comparison between the roof deformation processes, ATD and vehicle kinematics leading to these two impacts identifies that there is a clear difference in the mechanisms leading to the registered neck loading. While 5 R 3 is a result of the impact the vehicle experiences with the ground being transferred directly to the contained and seat-belted occupant (i. e. diving), 7 L 4 is a result of structural failure of the roof increasing the roof intrusion velocity and thus the ATDâs head impact velocity above that which would otherwise be caused via a pure diving mechanism. Finally, to identify the level of roof strength required to protect contained and seatbelted occupants from severe or fatal spinal neck injury, a simplified theoretical investigation based on the principles of energy absorption and vehicle kinematics over the duration of a rollover crash, is presented in Chapter 7. The analysis of Malibu II crash tests associated with Chapter 4 and 6 as well as the published work of other researchers (Friedman, 2008 and Brumbelow, 2009) were investigated using this simplified approach. Based on observations of the Malibu II crash test series, and particularly test 3 of this crash test series, the process of crash energy dissipation during an FMVSS 208 dolly rollover is examined. The resulting mathematical estimate for a vehicleâs roof Strength-to-vehicle Weight Ratio (SWR) that would protect occupants from severe or fatal neck injury, based on the criteria of no structural failure of the vehicleâs roof, is 3. 69. This finding confirms the general consensus among vehicle crashworthiness rollover experts (Friedman, 2008; Friedman and Grzebieta, 2009; Brumbelow, 2009) that a SWR of 4. 0 or more provides optimum protection to occupants involved in rollover crashes. Furthermore, this calculation is original in that the Author is not aware of any research to date to use the laws of Newtonian physics and mathematics to justify adopting an SWR of around 4. 0. Chapter 8 concludes the thesis by summarising the findings of the Chapters, and from these identifying that the severity of spinal neck injury of contained occupants is driven by the roof deformation mechanisms, and therefore also the presence or absence of structural failure of the vehicleâs roof. Severe and fatal spinal neck injury mechanisms are a result of the increased head impact velocity a contained and seat-belted occupant experiences when structural failure of the roof occurs. However, most importantly, it is revealed that in a typical real world rollover crash (e. g. that replicated by the FMVSS 208 dolly rollover test protocol) for a strong roof vehicle, the upper head impact velocity and therefore the injury risk associated with a diving mechanism is limited to 2. 0 - 3. 0 m/sec. On the other hand, the vehicle in which structural failures demonstrate significantly increase roof deformation speed and the head impact velocity is observed to reach speeds up to and over two times that being observed in strong roof vehicle rollover, where typically only the diving mechanism occurs. In other words, this thesis provides scientific evidence that spinal neck injury observed in rollover crashes is causally related to roof strength...|$|E

[...] The notion of France gaining enormous strength by taking over Spain and all its European and overseas possessions was anathema to France's main rivals. Secondly the prospect of dividing up Spanish holdings prove very attractive. France's enemies formed a Grand Alliance, led by the Holy Roman Empire's Leopold I.

I clung with all my {{strength}} to the hoop. I could not tell how badly I was frightened, but felt as though all my hair had been torn out. I scarcely had time to realize that I was alive, when, with a crash, I was projected with the velocity of a catapult into a burr chestnut tree. The netting and rigging, catching in the tree, checked my velocity, but I had my grasp jerked loose, and was precipitated through the limbs and landed flat upon my back, with my tights nearly torn off, and my legs, arms, and body lacerated and bleeding.â ...|$|R
60|$|This {{struggle}} {{not to be}} a scab, {{to avoid}} giving more for less and to succeed in giving less for more, is more vital than it would appear on the surface. The capitalist and labor groups are locked together in desperate battle, and neither <b>side</b> is <b>swayed</b> by moral considerations more than skin-deep. The labor group hires business agents, lawyers, and organizers, and is beginning to intimidate legislators by the strength of its solid vote; and more directly, in the near future, it will attempt to control legislation by capturing it bodily through the ballot-box. On the other hand, the capitalist group, numerically weaker, hires newspapers, universities, and legislatures, and strives to bend to its need all the forces which go to mould public opinion.|$|R
50|$|Charles II made a {{disastrous}} decision: {{in his will}} he bequethed his throne to the Bourbon candidate, a Frenchman who became Philip V of Spain. France, of course, rallied to the choice. However a coalition of enemies quickly formed, and a major European war broke out 1701-1714. The notion of France gaining enormous strength by taking over Spain and all its European and overseas possessions was anathema to France's main rivals. Secondly the prospect of dividing up Spanish holdings prove very attractive. France's enemies formed a Grand Alliance, led by the Holy Roman Empire's Leopold I. It included Prussia {{and most of the}} other German states, The Netherlands, Portugal, Savoy (in Italy) and especially England. France took control of Spanish forces and added a few allies in Bavaria and among several local dukes in Italy and Germany. Extensive fighting took place primarily in the Netherlands, with both <b>sides</b> <b>swaying</b> back and forth. When Emperor Leopold died, he was succeeded by his oldest son Joseph. However when Joseph died in 1811, his brother Charles became not only the Alliance candidate for king of Spain, but he also became Emperor. That combination would make the Empire much too powerful, so the allies deserted the alliance, and peace was at hand. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 resolved all of the issues. Philip V became king of Spain, and kept all his overseas colonies, but renounced any rights to the French throne. Spain lost its European holdings outside the homeland itself. As the former members of the alliance picked up their spoils. England gained Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Gibraltar, as well as trading rights in the Spanish colonies. Spain now had a new Bourbon government, which proved far more effective and energetic than the previous Habsburg rulers.|$|R
50|$|Trial of Misak Torlakian, an Armenian Ottoman subject, by the British Military Court, {{which took}} place at 10:00 A.M. on August 11, 1921, on the charge of murdering Binbud Khan Jivanshir, Ex-Minister of Interior of Azerbaijan. The trial of Misak Torlakian is the twin of the trial of Soghomon Tehlirian. Both trials {{involved}} {{the murder of a}} tyrant, and both of the perpetrators were found not guilty. During both trials, history, theology, philosophy, physiology, psychology, and politics were invoked by both <b>sides</b> to <b>sway</b> the Military Judge in the case of Torlakian, and the Jury of Peers in the case of Tehlirian. Thus in addition to being landmark legal cases, these two trials reveal the prevailing mindsets and political strategies of Germans, Turks, Armenians and Azerbaijanis in the aftermath of World War I.|$|R
25|$|Female P. californicus and P. apacheanus are {{unusual in}} that they perform an {{acceptance}} dance just before the male touches them. With forelegs high and wide apart and abdomen bent to the <b>side,</b> the female <b>sways</b> before the male, sometimes with a few steps {{to one side and}} then the other.
