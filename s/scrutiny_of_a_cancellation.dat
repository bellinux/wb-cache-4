In contrast, “thin” globalization (Barnett 2005) allows politically repressive regimes to flourish with little scrutiny and results in underdevelopment, economic stagnation, and unstable societies. As a consequence, some nations may be reluctant to openly embrace this global–local function.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{increasing}} calls to integrate the public’s voice into the parliamentary process. This article examines the impact of public reading stage (PRS) on the UK Parliament’s <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bill. <b>A</b> new stage <b>of</b> the legislative process piloted by the House of Commons in February 2013, PRS invited the public to comment on a bill undergoing parliamentary scrutiny (the Children and Families Bill). The PRS was designed to encourage {{members of the public}} to participate in the <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> legislation through <b>a</b> specially designed forum on Parliament’s website. Over 1000 comments were submitted. Drawing on <b>a</b> content analysis <b>of</b> the comments given by the public to the bill, complemented by interviews with MPs, key officials and PRS participants, we find that although the public reading stage had an impressive response, it failed to make much <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tangible impact on the parliamentary <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> the bill. This was largely due to the choice of bill being used for the pilot and its lack of appropriate integration into the formal legislative process...|$|R

The counterargument to this criticism, however, is that, by subjecting candidates to the <b>scrutiny</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few early states, the parties can weed out candidates who are unfit for office.|$|R
