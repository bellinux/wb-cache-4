5|$|The flaps {{are mounted}} by steel sliders and rollers, {{attached}} to brackets {{on the rear}} spar. The trapezoidal ailerons are near the wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an ellipsoidal section and is of semi-monocoque, <b>stressed-skin</b> construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing framework of longerons, beams and stringers, with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames. The one-piece horizontal tailplane {{is attached to the}} load-bearing frame at two mounting points.|$|E
25|$|Founded in 1923 by Dr.-Ing. Adolf Rohrbach, the Rohrbach Metall-Flugzeugbau GmbH {{designed}} and built many aircraft using light-alloy stressed skin construction methods that were {{at the cutting edge}} of aircraft design in the 1920s. His previous experience with light-alloys at the Zeppelin-Staaken factory served Rohrbach well when designing the Rohrbach <b>stressed-skin</b> aircraft.|$|E
25|$|During the interwar period, the RoAF, {{second only}} to Poland among the future Warsaw Pact countries, had a {{powerful}} national aircraft industry which designed and produced all types of military and most civil aircraft. In particular, the IAR 80 series were <b>stressed-skin</b> fighters, worthy to rank with the other single-seat fighters of WWII, and used in significant numbers on the Eastern Front.|$|E
25|$|The Don was {{designed}} to meet Air Ministry Specification T.6/36 for a multi-role trainer and was a single-engined monoplane of wooden <b>stressed-skin</b> construction. The DH.93 Don {{was intended to be}} a trainer for pilots and radio operators, and as a gunnery trainer, the gunnery requirement involved the mounting of a dorsal gun turret. Student pilot and instructor sat side by side up front, while accommodation for a trainee WT (radio) operator and the turret gunner was behind in the cabin.|$|E
25|$|The AB-13 {{was a small}} single-bay biplane {{of mixed}} construction. It had wooden <b>stressed-skin</b> wings with plywood {{skinning}} that folded to allow easy storage aboard ship, while combat flaps were fitted as the aircraft was required to have sufficient maneuverability for air combat {{as well as its}} normal observation missions. The fuselage was of metal construction, with the pilot sitting in an open cockpit, but the observer's position being enclosed. Both float and wheeled undercarriages were designed, with the seaplane having a single main float, while the landplane version had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Power was provided by a single Nakajima Hikari radial engine.|$|E
25|$|The Elite's most {{distinctive}} feature was its highly innovative fibreglass monocoque construction, {{in which a}} <b>stressed-skin</b> GRP unibody replaced the previously separate chassis and body components. Unlike the contemporary Chevrolet Corvette, which used fibreglass for only exterior bodywork, the Elite used glass-reinforced plastic for the entire load-bearing structure of the car, although a steel subframe for supporting the engine and front suspension was bonded into {{the front of the}} monocoque, as was a square-section windscreen-hoop that provided mounting points for door hinges, jacking point for lifting the car and roll-over protection. The first 250 body units were made by Maximar Mouldings at Pulborough, Sussex. The body construction caused numerous early problems, until manufacture was handed over to Bristol Aeroplane Company.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>stressed-skin</b> construction, Reggiane introduced several advanced features on the Re.2000, such as a modern structure, which was considerably more advanced than the ones used in Macchi's and other Italian fighters of the time, along with an elliptical wing profile. Overall, the design possessed greater aerodynamic sophistication in comparison to other Italian rivals rivals such as the Fiat G.50 and Macchi C.200. The Re.2000 was furnished with retractable landing gear; the main gear retracted via the Curtiss method, the wheels rotating around to face flat within the wheel wells when retracted. The atypical fairing covered the landing gear's actuation mechanism, while the legs incorporated hydraulic shock absorbers and drag struts to effective absorb loads; pneumatic brakes were also fitted. The tail wheel was both retractable and steerable.|$|E
25|$|Though {{faster and}} more {{advanced}} than the RAF's current front line biplane fighters, {{the design of the}} Hurricane's construction was already considered to be somewhat outdated when introduced to service and resembled those used on the earlier biplanes. Hawker had decided to employ its traditional construction techniques instead of radical measures such as the adoption of a <b>stressed-skin</b> metal exterior. The primary structure comprised a Warren truss box-girder that made use of high-tensile steel longerons and duralumin cross-bracing, which were mechanically fastened instead of welded. Over this, a secondary structure composed of wooden formers and stringers gave the fuselage a rounded external shape, which carried a doped linen covering. The majority of the external surfaces were linen, save for a section between the cockpit and the engine cowling that used lightweight metal panels instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} is of all-metal construction, with cantilever mid-wings with detachable tips. The {{leading edges}} are swept-back, and the <b>stressed-skin</b> wings have flaps inboard of the ailerons. The fuselage is a monocoque structure, with a hinged nose to allow loading of a stretcher or other awkward loads. Seating {{can be arranged}} for one pilot and five passengers, or two pilots and three passengers. There is a door {{on both sides of}} the cabin, and there is a baggage compartment behind the rear seats. The tailplane has twin fins at the ends of the dihedral stabiliser. The elevators and rudders are fabric-covered. The tricycle landing gear is hydraulically retractable. The two engines are mounted towards the rear of the wing, driving 2-bladed fixed-pitch pusher propellers. Originally planned to use Blackburn Cirrus Major III engines, it was fitted with Walter Minor 6-III engines.|$|E
25|$|The Fairey Battle was a {{single-engine}} monoplane light bomber, {{powered by}} a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. Production aircraft were progressively powered by various models of the Merlin engine, such as the Merlin I, II, III and V. The Battle had a relatively clean design, having adopted a slim oval-shaped fuselage which was manufactured in two separate sections. The forward section, {{in front of the}} cockpit, relied mainly upon a steel tubular structure to support the weight of the nose-mounted engine; the rear section was of a metal monocoque structure comprised hoop frames and Z-section stringers which was built on jigs. The structure of the aircraft involved several innovations and firsts for Fairey, it had the distinction of being the company's first low-wing monoplane; it also was the first implementation of a light-alloy <b>stressed-skin</b> construction to be produced by the firm.|$|E
25|$|The IS-1 Sęp was {{constructed}} of wood throughout with steel for high-stress areas and fittings. The fuselage was a plywood-covered semi-monocoque structure with smooth lines. Incorporated in the fuselage was the cockpit, which {{was covered by}} a built-up plexi-glass canopy, and an integral fin which supported the plywood <b>stressed-skin</b> tailplane just above the fuselage top decking level. The undercarriage consisted of a long pneumatically-sprung ash skid under the nose and a rubber-sprung tail skid. For take-off a jettisonable two-wheeled dolly {{was attached to the}} front skid. As with all drop-off dollies it was important to release the dolly at the right moment to avoid the dolly bouncing into the structure, causing damage. An aero-tow hook was provided in the extreme nose, as well as a bungee hook and twin winch-launch hooks either side of the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|Many design {{elements}} of the Sperrin had {{more in common with}} aircraft of the Second World War than those of the new jet age. The design was relatively straightforward in most aspects, with the exceptions of the flight controls and the unusual engine arrangement: The engines were mounted in pairs in nacelles mid-wing, one engine being stacked above the other, for a total of four engines. VX-158 had the distinction of being the first aircraft to receive production Rolls-Royce Avon engines; other engines such improved Avon models and the de Havilland Gyron would also be installed on the two prototypes for test purposes. The airframe was built largely of light aluminium alloys, principally the 75ST alloy; the outer skin of the aircraft had a highly smooth <b>stressed-skin</b> surface also composed of light alloys, in part due to this, the measured drag was considerably low.|$|E
25|$|A {{key reason}} for the aircraft's appeal was its {{relatively}} simple construction and ease of manufacture. In comparison to the Supermarine Spitfire, it was significantly cheaper and involved less labour, requiring 10,300 man hours to produce versus 15,200 for the Spitfire. As a large-scale war was looking increasingly likely, and time was of the essence in providing the RAF with an effective fighter aircraft, it was unclear if the more advanced Spitfire would enter production smoothly, while the Hurricane made use of well-understood manufacturing techniques. This factor was equally applicable for its use within service squadrons as well, which were experienced in working on and repairing aircraft whose construction employed the same principles as the Hurricane, and the simplicity of its design enabled the improvisation of some remarkable repairs in squadron workshops. A fabric-covered wing patterned upon traditional Hawker designs was initially adopted in order to speed up production; a higher-performing <b>stressed-skin</b> metal wing took its place in late 1939.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the Gnat is of a conventional metal <b>stressed-skin</b> nature, employing extensive flush-rivetting. Machining of components was deliberately avoided to minimise workload and cost, for the same reasons, {{there is only a}} minimal use of intensive fabrication methods such as forging and casting. The airframe can be constructed using simplistic jigs without any specialised skills or tooling being required. The layout and construction techniques used for the airframe allows for it to be rapidly disassembled into its major subsections, the entirety of which could be performed without the use of cranes or ladders; the Gnat was vastly easier to service than most other aircraft. Many elements of the airframe showed considerable attention to easy of fabrication and low cost; for example, the wing was reportedly able to be produced at a quarter of the cost and less than one-fifth of the man-hours in comparison to contemporary wings used by typical fighter aircraft of the era.|$|E
500|$|The XBTM-1 was a low-wing, {{all-metal}} monoplane with folding {{wings to}} allow more compact storage in carrier hangar decks, and conventional landing gear. Its fuselage was an oval-shaped <b>stressed-skin</b> semi-monocoque with the single-seat cockpit and its teardrop-shaped [...] canopy positioned just aft of the air-cooled engine. Just behind the cockpit was a [...] fuel tank. The large wing consisted of a two-spar center section with hydraulically-folded three-spar outer panels. A large dive brake was positioned on {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. When closed it could be lowered for use as a landing flap or it could be split into alternating upper and lower sections, with intermeshing [...] "fingers" [...] for use in its intended role. It was very effective in this role, mainly due to its great surface area, but this was at the cost of the width of the ailerons, which significantly reduced their efficiency. A pair of [...] fuel tanks were positioned in the roots of the center section. All fuel tanks were self sealing and the pilot and oil cooler were protected by [...] of armor.|$|E
500|$|The new design, {{given the}} company {{designation}} B-48, was known unofficially by Blackburn as the [...] "Firecrest" [...] but was always {{known by its}} specification number by the Air Ministry and Navy. It was a low-winged, single-seat, all-metal monoplane. Aft of the cockpit the fuselage was an oval-shaped <b>stressed-skin</b> semi-monocoque, but forward it had a circular-section, tubular-steel frame. The cockpit of the Firecrest was moved forward and raised the pilot's position so that he now looked over the wing leading edge, and down the nose. The canopy was adapted from the Hawker Tempest fighter. In the rear fuselage was a single [...] fuel tank with two [...] fuel tanks in the centre wing section. The aircraft had a redesigned, thinner, inverted gull wing of laminar flow aerofoil section. The wing consisted of a two-spar centre section with just over 6.5 degrees of anhedral and outer panels with 9 degrees of dihedral. It could be hydraulically folded in two places to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers. Four Fowler flaps were fitted to give good low-speed handling for landing and the wing had retractable dive brakes on both surfaces. In {{the course of the}} redesign the structure was simplified which reduced weight by 1,400lb (635kg) and even after the fuel capacity was increased by [...] the gross weight was still [...] less than that of the Firebrand.|$|E
500|$|Under the plan, on 12 July 1938, the Air Ministry {{bought a}} site {{consisting}} of farm fields and a sewage works next to Castle Bromwich Aerodrome in Birmingham. This shadow factory would supplement Supermarine's original factories in Southampton {{in building the}} Spitfire. The Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory (CBAF) ordered the most modern machine tools then available, which were being installed two months after work started on the site. Although Morris Motors under Lord Nuffield (an expert in mass motor-vehicle construction) at first managed and equipped the factory, it was funded by government money. When the project was first discussed {{it was estimated that}} the factory would be built for £2,000,000, however, by the beginning of 1939 this cost had doubled to over £4,000,000. The Spitfire's <b>stressed-skin</b> construction required precision engineering skills and techniques outside the experience of the local labour force, which took some time to train. However, even as the first Spitfires were being built in June 1940, the factory was still incomplete, and there were numerous problems with the factory management, which ignored tooling and drawings provided by Supermarine in favour of tools and drawings of its own designs, and with the workforce which, while not completely stopping production, continually threatened strikes or [...] "slow downs" [...] until their demands for higher than average pay rates were met.|$|E
500|$|The B-37, {{given the}} service name [...] "Firebrand" [...] on 11 July 1941, was a low-winged, {{all-metal}} monoplane. Aft {{of the cockpit}} the fuselage was an oval-shaped <b>stressed-skin</b> semi-monocoque, but forward it had a circular-section, tubular-steel frame that housed the [...] main fuel tank and the [...] auxiliary fuel tank behind the engine. The radiators for the neatly cowled Sabre engine were housed in wing-root extensions. The large wing consisted of a two-spar centre section with manually folded outer panels (with five degrees of dihedral) to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers. To increase lift and reduce landing speed the wing was fitted with large, hydraulically powered Fairey-Youngman flaps that extended {{to the edges of}} the Frise ailerons. The fixed armament of four [...] Hispano autocannon was fitted in the outer wing panels with 200 rounds per gun. The fin and rudder were positioned forward of the elevator to ensure spin recovery and that the rudder would retain its effectiveness. The mainwheels of the conventional landing gear were mounted at the ends of the centre wing section and retracted inwards. The Firebrand was unusual in {{the fact that there was}} an airspeed gauge mounted outside of the cockpit so that during landing the pilot would not have to look down into the cockpit to take instrument readings, foreshadowing the modern heads-up display.|$|E
2500|$|Plywood is {{also used}} as an {{engineering}} material for <b>stressed-skin</b> applications. It {{has been used for}} marine and aviation applications since WWII. Most notable is the British de Havilland Mosquito bomber, with a fuselage made of birch plywood sandwiching a balsa core, and using plywood extensively for the wings. Plywood was also used for the hulls in the hard-chine Motor Torpedo Boats (MTB) and Motor Gun Boats [...] (MGB) built by the British Power Boat Company and Vosper's. Plywood is currently successfully used in <b>stressed-skin</b> applications. The American designers Charles and Ray Eames are known for their plywood-based furniture, as is Finnish Architect Alvar Aalto and his firm Artek, while Phil Bolger has designed a wide range of boats built primarily of plywood. Jack Köper of Cape Town designed the plywood Dabchick sailing dinghy, which [...] is still sailed by large numbers of teenagers.|$|E
2500|$|The aircraft's {{elliptical}} wing {{was built}} using a unique <b>stressed-skin</b> structure, designed by Barnes Wallis for lightness. The {{top and bottom}} were manufactured separately, and then clamped together at the leading and trailing edges, this being named [...] "peapod" [...] or [...] "lobster-claw" [...] structure. This allowed a large internal space unobstructed by ribs, hence capable of housing large fuel tanks (similar to Wallis's geodetic designs).|$|E
2500|$|In 1935, Canada {{selected}} the Delta {{for use as}} a photographic survey aircraft for use by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), to be built by Canadian Vickers under license. One aircraft, the last Delta built by Northrop, was supplied as a part assembled pattern to Canadian Vickers, first flying on 16 August 1936 and being delivered to the RCAF on 1 September that year. [...] It was followed by a further 19 aircraft built wholly by Canadian Vickers, production continuing until October 1940. The Northrop Delta was the first all-metal, <b>stressed-skin</b> aircraft built in Canada.|$|E
2500|$|Czechoslovakia {{chose the}} MB.200 {{as part of}} a {{modernisation}} program for its air force of the [...] mid-1930s. [...] Although at the rate of aircraft development at that time, the MB.200 would quickly become obsolete, the Czechoslovakians needed a quick solution involving the license production of a proven design, as their own aircraft industry did not have sufficient development experience with such a large aircraft, or with all-metal airframes and <b>stressed-skin</b> construction, placing an initial order for 74 aircraft. After some delays, both Aero and Avia began license-production in 1937, with [...] a total of about 124 built. Czechoslovakian MB.200s were basically similar to their French counterparts, with differences in defensive armament and other equipment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structural}} load {{is supported by}} a <b>stressed-skin</b> design. Each leg is embedded in [...] of concrete [...] thick and [...] deep. [...] of the foundation is in bedrock. The arch is resistant to earthquakes and is designed to sway up to [...] in either direction, while withstanding winds up to [...] The structure weighs , of which concrete composes structural steel interior, and the stainless steel panels that cover the exterior of the arch, [...] This amount of stainless steel is the most used in any one project in history. The base of each leg at ground level had to have an engineering tolerance of [...] or the two legs would not meet at the top.|$|E
2500|$|When Jack Northrop {{set up the}} Northrop Corporation as a {{joint venture}} with the Douglas Aircraft Company in 1932, he set out to design two closely related single-engined {{aircraft}} as the new company's first products: a mailplane/record-breaking aircraft, which was designated the Gamma, and a passenger transport, the Delta. [...] The Delta was a low-winged monoplane, with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. It was of all-metal, <b>stressed-skin</b> construction, with streamlining spats covering the main landing gear. [...] While the Delta's wings were common with those of the Gamma, it had a new, wider fuselage, which seated the pilot in an enclosed cockpit immediately behind the engine, and had accommodation for eight passengers in a cabin behind the pilot.|$|E
2500|$|Design of the Loire-Nieuport 10 {{started in}} 1937, with the {{resultant}} aircraft being a twin-engined monoplane of all-metal <b>stressed-skin</b> construction with inverted gull (or W-shaped) wings. [...] It was powered by two Gnome-Rhône 14N [...] radial engines mounted above the wings, with the twin large floats on pylons under the wing, directly beneath the engines. [...] The deep fuselage accommodated {{a crew of}} six, with pilot and co-pilot seated in tandem, while a glazed nose was provided for the bomb-aimer/navigator. [...] Defensive armament was a machine gun in the nose, with another firing through a ventral hatch, and a 20mm cannon in a dorsal turret, while it could carry two torpedoes or 1,200kg (2,700lb) of bombs in an internal bomb-bay.|$|E
2500|$|An all-metal, <b>stressed-skin</b> wing of duraluminium (a DERD {{specification}} {{similar to}} AA2024) {{was introduced in}} April 1939 and was used {{for all of the}} later marks. [...] "The metal skinned wings allowed a diving speed that was [...] higher than the fabric-covered ones. They were very different in construction but were interchangeable with the fabric-covered wings; one trials Hurricane, L1877, was even flown with a fabric-covered port wing and metal-covered starboard wing. The great advantage of the metal-covered wings over the fabric ones was that the metal ones could carry far greater stress loads without needing so much structure beneath." [...] Several fabric-wing Hurricanes were still in service during the Battle of Britain, although a good number had had their wings replaced during servicing or after repair. Changing the wings only required three hours work per aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>stressed-skin</b> wings were of {{constant}} chord with rounded tips, and the fuselage was entirely of monocoque construction. The horizontal tail {{was set at}} the top of the fuselage and carried horn-balanced elevators; the rudder was large and pointed. All flying surfaces were fabric-covered. The wing also carried split flaps and connected wingtip slots to improve handling at the low speeds required by the specification. The wide-track main undercarriage retracted inwards into the centre-section but the tailwheel was fixed and spatted. The pilot and observer/gunner/bomb aimer sat in tandem cockpits under a continuous canopy, the rear part of which was modified when the [...]303in (7.7mm) Lewis Gun mounting was changed from Scarff ring to a pillar type. The observer could also access a prone aiming position on the floor to drop bombs from the external racks. Two [...]303in (7.7mm) machine guns were mounted in the port wing.|$|E
2500|$|The fleet {{was ordered}} by the British Transport Commission as direct {{comparison}} with British Rail Class 40, and were not actually wanted by the Western Region, who preferred their production fleet of D800 Warships. [...] The D600s {{were the result of}} power politics within the BTC and the WR: the former was unwilling to sanction radical, <b>stressed-skin</b> lightweight construction locomotives at the time, while the latter was equally insistent {{that at least some of}} the new Type 4 power range locomotives on order be equipped with hydraulic transmission. [...] They were much heavier than production Warships (almost [...] compared to [...] ) and can be regarded as standard 1950s British design diesel locomotives that just happened to contain two lightweight, high-revving diesel engines coupled to hydraulic transmissions rather than one large, slow-revving diesel engine and electrical generator set. [...] For this reason they were practically obsolete in design terms before they had left the drawing board.|$|E
2500|$|The engines were {{developments}} of the Rolls-Royce Kestrel K.26, later renamed Peregrine. The first prototype, L6844, used long exhaust ducts that were channelled through the wings and fuel tanks, exiting at the wing's trailing edge. This configuration was quickly changed to more conventional, external exhausts after Westland's Chief test pilot Harald Penrose nearly lost control when an exhaust duct broke and heat-fractured an aileron control rod. The engines were cooled by ducted radiators, which were set into the leading edges of the wing centre-sections to reduce drag. The airframe was built mainly of <b>stressed-skin</b> duraluminium, {{with the exception of}} the rear-fuselage, which used a magnesium alloy stressed skin. With the pilot sitting high under one of the world's first full bubble canopies and the low and forward location of the wing, all round visibility was good (except for directly over the nose). Four 20mm cannon were mounted in the nose; the 600lb/minute fire rate made it the most heavily armed fighter aircraft of its era. The clustering of the weapons also meant that there were no convergence problems as with wing-mounted guns. Hopes were so high for the design that it remained [...] "top secret" [...] for much of its development, although it had already been mentioned in the French press.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{motorcycle}} show in November 1951, Sharp's announced what they described as [...] "a revolutionary {{design in the}} field of commercial vehicles". [...] The Sharp's Commercial 3 Cwt took the concept of the Minicar's light, three-wheeled, utilitarian design, and adapted it as the basis for an open-top lightweight industrial vehicle. The yellow and black prototype at the show was powered by an Indian Brave [...] four-stroke side valve engine (supplied by Brockhouse Engineering Co., Southport) and mounted in a cradle ahead and above the front wheel. Though described as [...] "constructed on the <b>stressed-skin</b> principle", large cut outs to allow easy access from either side of the vehicle required much additional strengthening to the floor, with a central steel backbone girder, a cross member between the rear wheels and further triangular bracing. The single seat was located centrally as was the steering wheel. Steering was by worm and sector, and flared side panels allowed the single front wheel to turn a full 180°, making the vehicle extremely manoeuvrable. The entire engine, drive-train and steering unit could be removed by undoing four bolts to allow for easy servicing. Unlike the Minicar, there were brakes on all three wheels and there was a wooden-slatted floor behind the driver. Though the Sharp's Commercial never entered production, it served as a forerunner to van and pickup versions of the Mark B which appeared in 1952.|$|E
