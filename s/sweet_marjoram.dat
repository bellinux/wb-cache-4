40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of a study}} conducted in the years 2007 – 2008 {{was to determine the}} nitrate content of the edible parts of vegetables and spice plants. The analyzed materi-als consisted of the following species: tomatoes, carrots, <b>sweet</b> basil and <b>marjoram</b> grown in the field, and tomatoes and chili peppers grown in a plastic tunnel. The experiment comprised different cultivation methods, sowing and planting dates, and fertilization lev-els. Among the analyzed cultivars of field-grown tomatoes, increased nitrate concentra-tions were observed in the fruits of cv. Złoty Ożarowski. Similar results were noted when eight tomato cultivars were grown in an unheated plastic tunnel. The fruits of cv. Bawole Serce had the lowest nitrate content, compared with the remaining tomato cultivars. Sup-plemental fertilization of tomato plants grown under cover significantly contributed to ni-trate accumulation. The fruits of chili peppers grown in a plastic tunnel had a very low ni-trate content. As regards marjoram, the highest nitrate concentrations were reported for the second date of sowing. The average nitrate content of carrot storage roots did not ex-ceed the maximum permissible levels. Supplemental fertilization contributed to an insig-nificant increase in the N-NO 3 content of carrot roots...|$|R

Mrs. Bhaer sympathized with her, but tired to curb her frantic desire for entire liberty, showing her that she must wait a little, learn self-control, and be ready to use her freedom before she asked for it. Nan had meek moments when she agreed to this, and the influences at work upon her were gradually taking effect.

40|$|To {{avoid any}} {{contamination}} risk of edible crops, the safety use of treated municipal wastewater is growing industrial non-food {{crops such as}} aromatic plants to produce volatile oils for manufacturing soaps, cosmetics and perfumes, etc. Therefore, two field experiments were conducted in a sandy soil to investigate the influence of treated domestic sewage effluents or freshwater (control) on the essential oils of geranium, peppermint, fennel, marjoram, and chamomile plants. In the first experiment, the plants were irrigated with treated domestic sewage effluents, while in the second the plants irrigated with fresh water and received the mineral fertilizers. Heavy metals accumulation in plant organs and the nutritional status of plants were studied. Results indicated that the treated municipal waste water contain obvious amount of nutrients sufficiently to growing the tested crops and the plants had higher herb yield than that irrigated with fresh water.

All subjects inhaled the essential oil through a face mask attached to one-way valve, and beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) and arterial blood pressure (BP) as well as breath-by-breath respiratory variables were continuously recorded. In both protocols, during fragrance inhalation of the essential oil, time-dependent decrease in mean BP and HR were observed (P< 0. 05). During post-inhalation recovery, the significant fragrance-induced bradycardic effect lasted at least 5 min (- 3. 1 ± 3. 9 % vs. pre-inhalation baseline value, p< 0. 05). The mean BP response at the start of odor stimulation was approximated by a first-order exponential model. However, such fragrance-induced changes were not observed in the respiratory variables.

Four horizontal white sticky plates were placed adjacent to (directions: N, S, E, W) a central horizontal white plate (C). After 24 h, in the treatment combination where the four plates were sprayed with essential oil surrounding a central sticky plate sprayed with ethyl iso-nicotinate, fewer onion thrips were found on the plates treated with <b>sweet</b> <b>marjoram</b> [Origanum majorana L.

We also {{compared the}} distribution of onion thrips on the plates. Relative thrips numbers on each plate were compared with similar (N, S, E, W, and C) plates in the control treatment. There were relatively lower thrips numbers on the south (23 % reduction) and west (26 % reduction) O. majorana-treated plates and higher numbers (37 % increase) on the central attractant-treated plate indicating a short-distance push-pull effect. When four plates were sprayed with the thrips attractant surrounding a central sticky plate sprayed with an essential oil or water (control), only O. majorana reduced the number of thrips on the attractant-sprayed plates (62 % reduction). The distribution of thrips on the different plates within this treatment combination did not change substantially when compared to the distribution in the water-control treatment. Other essential oils tested (wormwood [Artemisia arborescens L. (Compositae) ]) and tea tree [Melaleuca alternifolia (Maiden. & Betche.) Cheel. (Myrtaceae) ]) were not effective in any of the treatments. It appears that O. majorana is a promising thrips repellent which could be used for further testing in a push-pull system with the attractant ethyl iso-nicotinate. The field setup used also proved to be a valuable tool for evaluating the potential of repellents to control onion thrips...|$|E
