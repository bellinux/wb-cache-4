2500|$|With the {{relative}} {{failure of the}} F-104A in the interceptor role, [...] the 84th FIS was re-equipped with the McDonnell F-101B Voodoo in 1959 and the 83d FIS in 1960. [...] The F-101Bs were modified versions of the SAC F-101A nuclear attack aircraft (designed for one-way missions carrying tactical nuclear weapons) by modifying the avionics systems and fire control systems for air-to-air missiles. [...] The last [...] F-101Bs were delivered in March 1961, and once the teething troubles with its fire control <b>system</b> <b>issues</b> were corrected, the F-101B {{proved to be a}} quite successful interceptor. However, it was outshone by the faster and more maneuverable Convair F-106A Delta Dart when that interceptor finally entered service.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the conflict, Angola faced {{deterioration}} in central planning, economic development and growth, security, education and health <b>system</b> <b>issues.</b> Like the other newly independent African territories involved in the Portuguese Colonial War, Angola's rank in the human development and GDP per capita world tables fell. [...] After independence, economic and social recession, corruption, poverty, inequality and failed central planning eroded the initial post independence expectations. A level of economic development comparable to what had existed under Portuguese rule became a major goal for the governments of the independent territory. The sharp recession and the chaos in many areas of Angolan life eroded the initial impetus of nationalistic fervor. There were also eruptions of black racism in the former overseas province against white and mulatto Angolans.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2011, Nissan {{announced}} that {{customers in the}} United States and Japan reported problems in restarting their Leaf vehicles after switching the motor off. Nissan said the problem does not pose any accident risk. On April 15. Nissan {{announced that}} the problem only affected {{a small proportion of}} Leafs. Nissan engineers identified a programming error in an air conditioning system sensor that sometimes triggers an erroneous high voltage alert when the air conditioning unit is switched on, due to the increased demand for power. The <b>system</b> <b>issues</b> an Inhibit Restart command, which does not prevent driving the vehicle, but does prevent it restarting after it is turned off. [...] The solution requires reprogramming of the Vehicle Control Module by a Nissan dealer. Nissan announced a [...] "service campaign" [...] to apply the software fix to all 5,300 Nissan Leafs in operation around the world, but it was not an official recall because it was not a safety issue. The applied software update also improves the carâ€™s on-board range calculation system, which several Leaf owners reported was overestimating the number of miles left. In addition, the update changes the state-of-charge bars display to provide a true reserve capacity; the driver now has up to five miles to find a charging spot after the car reaches the zero miles remaining mark.|$|E
