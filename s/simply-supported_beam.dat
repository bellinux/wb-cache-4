In this study, the application of passive vibration absorber is investigated and its effectiveness are further researched by comparing the use of single and multiple absorber for the structural vibration control. The vibration absorber system is designed to minimize the vibration amplitude of a <b>simply-supported</b> <b>beam</b> and a simply-supported plate. The beam and plate's vibration characteristic, such as natural frequency and mode shape are determined using three approaches: experimental testing, analytical equations and finite element analysis. In the initial stage, a finite element simulation study is conducted using Ansysm to validate the analytical equations of Matlab and experimental results of a <b>simply-supported</b> <b>beam</b> and a simply-supported plate. The preliminary result indicates that the first four natural frequencies of a <b>simply-supported</b> <b>beam</b> and a simply-supported plate are well-correlated between finite element, analytical and experiment results. Later the research works are further performed with attached single and multiple vibration absorbers. The result shows that multiple vibration absorber produced better results compare to single vibration absorber attachment in reducing the structural's resonance amplitude. The outcomes of overall global vibration reduction for multiple absorber is 9 times while single absorber is only 6 times. In the end, we can conclude that multiple vibration absorber is more effective and shows better result in reducing the resonance vibration of the structure...|$|E

40|$|Discrete lateral {{restraints}} {{offer an}} effective means of stabilising beams against lateral-torsional buckling. Design expressions for <b>simply-supported</b> <b>beams</b> braced regularly along their span with elastic restraints, based on analytically-derived formulae, are presented herein. These include the minimum restraint stiffness required to force the beam to buckle in between the restraint nodes and the forces induced in the restraints, along with a brief treatment of the critical moment of the beam. It is demonstrated that there is close agreement between the values obtained from the design formulae and their original analytical counterparts. These are also compared with the results from design formulae based on analogous column behaviour, an approach commonly used in design codes. It is found that the column rules used by design codes return values that, when compared with the results of the current analysis, are overly conservative for cases where the restraints are positioned at the compression flange of the beam but unsafe for restraints positioned at the shear centre...|$|R

The similarity of structure problems and metal deformation problems allows the solution of Michell layouts by using slip-line field theory. Matrix operator methods were applied to determine shapes of tension and compression members {{for a variety of}} minimum-weight structures. Application examples are given, including torsion wheels, basic cantilevers, extended cantilevers and <b>simply-supported</b> <b>beams.</b> ^ Numerical procedures were established to find structure layouts by using MatLab as the programming language with the use of matrix operators. The analysis for a framework as a truss was used to determine internal forces for the structure members. In order to obtain uniform stress and strain distributions required by Michell 2 ̆ 7 s theorem, the thickness dimensions were computed in proportion to the forces they carry. Solid models were then created in CAD software and imported into a rapid manufacturing machine to make prototypes for visualization and testing purposes. ^ In general, a basic cantilever is defined by its depth, length and width. An optimization technique is therefore applied to define design variables from the engineering information to minimize errors of desired and generated geometries. ^ A <b>simply-supported</b> symmetrical <b>beam</b> with a constant height was loaded in compression in the testing machine. An I-beam, occupying the same volume, having the same space and made from the same material, was also subjected to the same loads.

There is especially a growing interest for in situ health monitoring, i. e. smart structures which can continuously monitor their structural integrity by using bonded or embedded sensors and actuators. The aim of this research project is to assess the use of a time-frequency tool to enhance the detection of damage in an instrumented structure at the earliest stage.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} available displacement-based modelling techniques {{for the analysis of}} steel-concrete composite beams with partial shear interaction, which include the finite difference method, the finite element method, the direct stiffness method and the exact analytical model. Both shortand long-term analyses have been considered in order to provide an indication of how these affect the accuracy of the predictions. For the implementation of the finite difference method and of the finite element method, discretisations in both space and time domains are required, while only the time discretisation needs to be specified for the direct stiffness method and the exact analytical solutions. The time-dependent behaviour of the concrete has been modelled by means of the age-adjusted effective modulus method (AEMM) while the remaining materials at the cross-section have been assumed to behave in a linear-elastic manner. The results obtained using these formulations are qualitatively compared and their accuracy is estimated adopting the exact analytical model as a benchmark reference with the objective of establishing the minimum spatial discretisations required to keep the error within an acceptable tolerance.

Although the maximum velocity of Tsunami might be estimated as 15 m/s in typical seashore, it may be thought that around 7 m/second is the maximum velocity of the flotsam in inland. The impact velocity of falling weight is proportional to the square root of the falling height of the weight, so that the maximum falling height in this test is determined as 2. 5 m corresponding to the velocity of 7 m/s. Another four specimens were also conducted under static condition which are the standard references to be compared with the specimens subjected to impact loads.

40|$|The {{present study}} is aimed at {{examining}} the structural response of steel-fibre-reinforced concrete (SFRC) columns under reversed-cyclic loading, which were investigated by means of non-linear finite-element analysis (NLFEA). The focus was on investigating the potential of steel fibres in compensating for reduction in conventional transverse reinforcement [and thus the spacing between shear links was increased by 50 % and 100 % while the fibre volume fraction (Vf) was increased to 1 %, 1. 5 %, 2 % and 2. 5 %]. This is useful in situations where the latter is required in significant amounts (e. g. in seismic design) leading to congestion and practical difficulties in placing the links. The critical factor in the seismic response is the cyclic nature of the load, which is examined in the present research work. An interesting feature of the present research work is the consideration of statically-indeterminate SFRC columns, information on which is rare as previous research {{studies have focused on}} <b>simply-supported</b> <b>beams.</b> To address this, both indeterminacy and axial loads were considered in the present investigation.

40|$|Department of Urban Environmental Engineering (Urban Infrastructure Engineering) The Finite Element (FE) {{models have}} been used in civil, {{mechanical}} and aerospace engineering field for system identification and response simulation under various unexperienced loadings. However, the original FE models are difficult to use directly in simulation because the original FE model is different with the present state of actual structure. Therefore the FE models are updated to minimize the differences with real structure. In the existing FE model updating method, generally translational responses measured by accelerometers have been employed to identify the structural properties and update numerical model controlling parameter. This paper proposes FE model updating method only uses rotational response such as angular velocity measurement because the rotational response is more sensitive to damage than translational response in numerical analysis on simply supported beam. First sensitivity of translational and rotational response is investigated by sensitivity analysis on a numerical <b>simply-supported</b> <b>beam.</b> The FE model updating is carried out for a numerical <b>simply-supported</b> <b>beam</b> using an optimization algorithm which minimizes the gap between responses from the actual structure and the FE model reduce. The used responses in FE model updating are natural frequencies and rotational mode shape obtained from angular velocities measured by gyroscope sensor. The sensitivity analysis shows that rotational responses have higher sensitivity than translational responses to the structural and boundary condition changes. Then, the updated model using existing translational response from the experiment two FE models updated using translational and rotational responses are compared to validate he improvement by proposed FE model updating method. From the experiment, using rotational responses is a good enough in FE model updating compared to existing method, using translational responses. ope...|$|E

Many codes gave a minimum splice length for tension and compression reinforcement as a factor of the bar diameter depending on many parameters such as concrete strength, steel yield stress, shape of bar end, shape of bar surface and also bar location. Also, codes gave another restriction about the percentage of total reinforcement to be spliced at the same time.
