She had relationships with high-ranking military officers, politicians, and others in influential positions in many countries. Her relationships and liaisons with powerful men frequently took her across international borders. Prior to World War I, she was generally viewed as an artist and a free-spirited bohemian, but as war approached, she began to be seen by some as a wanton and promiscuous woman, and perhaps a dangerous seductress.|$|E

500|$|Roberts {{formed a}} {{formidable}} centre-back pairing with Jon Ashton the following {{season as the}} team <b>started</b> <b>putting</b> a decent run of form together during late August and throughout September 2009; with the defence being particularly tight.

A month later, he doubled his goal tally, scoring the second goal in Stevenage's 2–0 victory against Chester City, before notching his third goal {{of the season in}} a 6–0 win over Vauxhall Motors in the FA Trophy. Roberts' fourth goal of the campaign came during another 6–0 win, this time at Eastbourne Borough, side-footing the ball into the net from a well-worked free-kick. He scored his fifth goal of the season in a 3–0 win over AFC Wimbledon at Kingsmeadow, sliding the ball into the net from close range. Roberts led the side out in their 2–0 win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough in April 2010; the game that ultimately secured promotion to the Football League {{for the first time in}} the club's history, winning the league with two games to spare. Roberts played a total of 49 times during the season, scoring five times from defence. He was also named as the Conference Premier Player of the Month for April 2010. Stevenage had the best defensive record in the league, conceding just 24 goals in 46 league matches, as well as ending the season having not conceded in their last six games; and conceding just two goals in their last 15 league matches. In May 2010, Roberts signed a new two-year contract with Stevenage.

2500|$|By early 1966, Wilson was {{fixated on}} moving the Beach Boys beyond their surf and hot rod aesthetic, which he {{believed}} had gone stale. At the same time, {{he wanted the}} approval of {{what was called the}} [...] "hip intelligentsia", in other words, the counterculture tastemakers. Collaborator Van Dyke Parks remembers: [...] "Brian sought me out ... At that time, people who experimented with psychedelics—no matter who they were—were viewed as 'enlightened people,' and Brian sought out the enlightened people." [...] Taylor, who was introduced to Wilson by Parks, started working as a publicist for the Beach Boys sometime before their album Pet Sounds was released in May 1966, and was assimilated into what was then an expanding coterie of Wilson's worldly-minded friends, musicians, mystics, and business advisers. He recalls that the [...] "genius" [...] promotion [...] "came about because Brian told me that he thought he was better than most other people believed him to be." [...] He gradually became aware of how highly regarded Wilson was to musician friends like Parks and singer Danny Hutton, and wondered why it wasn't the mainstream consensus, [...] "Then I <b>started</b> <b>putting</b> it around, making almost a campaign out of it." [...] For updating the band's image with first-hand accounts of Wilson's latest activities, Taylor's prestige was crucial in offering a credible perspective for those on the outside.

To this end, the Beach Boys paid him a salary of $750/month (equivalent to $ in [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|The tunnellers {{named the}} {{individual}} quarries after their home towns (Auckland, Wellington, Nelson, Blenheim, Christchurch, Russell and Dunedin for the New Zealanders, and Glasgow, Edinburgh, Crewe and London for the Britons). Assault tunnels were also dug, stopping a few metres {{short of the}} German line, ready to be blown open by explosives {{on the first day}} of the battle. On 4 January 1917, the unit <b>started</b> <b>putting</b> in electricity in the Ronville quarries. Two weeks later, most of the work on the connection tunnels in the Ronville underground system was complete. On 24 January, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company began installing direction signs in the underground system. The next day, they started early works to organise a tramway line into the Ronville and Saint-Sauveur systems. By that time, the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers had constructed 20kilometres of tunnels, graded as subways (foot traffic only), tramways (with rails for hand-drawn trolleys, for taking ammunition to the line and bringing casualties back from it) and railways (a light railway system). The tunnel system could accommodate 24,000 men and was equipped with running water, electric light, kitchens, latrines, a small power station and a medical centre with a fully equipped operating theatre. In addition to this, conventional mines were laid under the front lines, ready to be blown immediately before the assault. In the meantime, German sappers were actively conducting their own underground operations, seeking out Allied tunnels to assault and counter-mine. On 14–16 March 1917, the German withdrawal on the Hindenburg Line (Siegfried Stellung) made it impossible to attack from the Ronville system. Despite this setback, electricity was installed and tested in the whole system beneath Arras by 3 April 1917, ready for the start of the Battle of Arras on 9 April. On the first day of the battle, the New Zealand Tunnelling Company opened three tunnels located at the end of Saint-Sauveur system, allowing infantrymen to appear suddenly in the German trenches. Owing to the German withdrawal from their front line south-east of Arras, the unit also fired the only mine that was used on the Arras front on 9 April. It was located to the north-east at Blagny, and was a [...] charge, blown by the New Zealand Tunnelling Company at zero, 5.30 a.m. It destroyed two German dugouts, [...] of trench and a concrete pillbox. However, it also stunned and apparently buried some members of the 13th Royal Scots and impeded their assault temporarily.|$|E
