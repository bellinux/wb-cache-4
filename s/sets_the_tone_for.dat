5|$|Each {{year the}} event has a theme, and {{includes}} a cocktail hour and a formal dinner. During the cocktail hour, guests arrive {{to walk on the}} red carpet, tour the year's special themed exhibition, and be seated before the dinner party that includes entertainment from the preeminent entertainers of the day. The theme not only <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>for</b> the annual exhibit, but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold the theme of the year, oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world's leading fashion retailers. Sometimes, such as in 2013, the theme is a bit befuddling because it does not provide a clear stylistic directive, while at other times, such as 2014 the theme may be far more challenging to one gender than the other.|$|E

The strip <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>for</b> future strips with its nonsensical humor and flat visual punchline. In this particular strip, Mr. Bear and Téodor are discussing Téodor's confusion over a drum machine. Mr. Bear informs Téodor that there is an instruction manual.

Over {{the following}} 60 years or so, he {{is involved in}} many of the major military conflicts of the 19th century — always in spite of his best efforts to evade his duty. He is often selected for especially dangerous jobs because of his heroic reputation. He meets many famous people, and survives some of the worst military disasters (the First Anglo-Afghan War, Charge of the Light Brigade, the Siege of Cawnpore, Battle of the Little Bighorn, Battle of Isandlwana), always coming out with more heroic laurels. The date of his last adventures seems to have been around 1900. He dies in 1915.|$|E

500|$|... "Chapter 1" [...] <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>for</b> the environs of the series. According to David Carr the {{political}} environs have such [...] "marbleness" [...] that it belies the clandestine nature of political activities, {{including those of}} Underwood who says he is there to [...] "clear the pipes and keep the sludge moving". The fictional newspaper, The Washington Herald, is set with [...] "brutal" [...] lighting and drab furniture, {{in part because it}} was filmed at the real life Baltimore Sun offices.

500|$|In 2005 Lancashire {{starred in}} The Rotters' Club as a {{housewife}} in 1970s Birmingham. Also in 2005 {{she appeared in}} the BBC television film Cherished as Angela Cannings, a British woman who was wrongfully convicted of killing her two baby sons. Lancashire was proud {{to be involved with}} the project, having greatly admired Cannings strength of character during her ordeal, and being able to relate to her sense of anguish as a parent. In December 2005, Lancashire returned to West End theatre, taking on the role of Miss Adelaide in the Donmar Warehouse production of Guys and Dolls at the Piccadilly Theatre. Lancashire was due to stay with the production until March 2006, but due to a severe chest infection made her last appearance on 4 January. In 2006 Lancashire accepted an invitation to write a short autobiographic entry in Who's Who, an establishment [...] "bible" [...] of influential figures judged to have {{had a significant impact on}} British life and culture. Lancashire's only television acting role in 2006 was as house-wife and cake-maker Elaine in the BBC comedy drama Angel Cake. In November she presented an episode of the Five documentary series Disappearing Britain in which she interviewed people with memories of Wakes Week holidays in Blackpool during the early 20th century. In February 2007 she made an appearance in the E4 teen drama series Skins. This was followed by a leading role in the BBC Two television drama Sex, the City and Me as solicitor Ruth Gilbert. In October, Lancashire appeared in her first feature film, David Nicholls' And When Did You Last See Your Father? in which she played aunt Beaty. In December, she played the supporting role of Mrs Corney in the BBC's 2007 adaption of Charles Dickens' 1838 novel Oliver Twist. Whilst ambivalent about the serial as a whole, The Daily Mirrors Jane Simon singled Lancashire out for praise stating that she [...] "really <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>for</b> the cold, unfeeling world into which orphaned Oliver is born." ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>for</b> the whole project".|$|E

2500|$|Born in Philadelphia, PA, Stein {{was a child}} prodigy, {{playing the}} piano {{by the age of}} three and making his {{professional}} concert debut at the age of six. [...] He worked as a jazz composer and arranger for radio programs and big bands in the 1930s and early 1940s. He served in the army in World War II and moved to Hollywood in 1948, studying with the Italian composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. [...] Subsequently in 1951, he was hired by Universal Studios, where he scored the music for about 200 films. [...] His name was seldom in the movie credits because of the studio's tendency to give solo credit to the music supervisor. Nonetheless, he either wrote the main themes, from which he and his colleagues worked, or, equally important, wrote the opening music, which often <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>for</b> the film itself. In 1950, Stein married Anita Shervin who played a viola with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Later he left Universal and composed music for television.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{begins with}} [...] "Momma Speech Intro" [...] a 15-second intro of YG's mother {{screaming}} out to him, warning {{him that he}} [...] "better not be outside with them gangbangers." [...] This <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of the}} album, as it is filled with skits that reenact moments of YG's life. [...] "I Just Want To Party" [...] features fellow Los Angeles rappers Schoolboy Q and Jay Rock. The song is notable for featuring a collaboration with rappers affiliated, with the Bloods (YG and Jay Rock), and Crips (Schoolboy Q) street gangs. However, the song aims to put affiliations and street politics aside to do just party. On the Ty Dolla Sign-produced [...] "Really Be (Smokin' & Drinkin')", YG and Kendrick Lamar rap about using substances to numb the pain. Lamar justifies his affinity for alcohol and other vices by detailing the messed up things that’s happened to him recently, including the death of his friend Chad. The album closer [...] "Sorry Momma" [...] is an ode to YG's mother that features a gospel-like chorus sung by Ty Dolla Sign and a soulful saxophone backed instrumental created by Terrace Martin.|$|E

2500|$|This sonnet is {{important}} because it is the first one that Shakespeare gives us. It <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the collection of sonnets. According to Helen Vendler, this sonnet can be “as an index {{to the rest of the}} sonnets". The main reason she says that it {{is important}} is because it brings [...] "into play such a plethora of conceptual material; it seems a self-conscious groundwork laid for the rest". Scholars like Helen Vendler think that this particular sonnet may have been composed after the others. She says that because of the [...] "sheer abundance of values, images, and concepts important in the sequence which are called into play" [...] and [...] "the number of significant words brought to our attention" [...] in this sonnet, that it [...] "may have been deliberately composed late, as a 'preface' to the others". Philip Martin says that Sonnet 1 is important to the rest because it [...] "states the themes for the sonnets immediately following and also for the sequence at large". To him, the themes are announced in this sonnet and the later ones develop those themes. Joseph Pequigney says that Sonnet 1 does serve an introductory and does it unconventionally; [...] "it might on that very account be seen as a befitting way to begin the least conventional of Renaissance love-sonnet sequences". It provides a [...] "production of metaphorical motifs that will recur in the upcoming sonnets, particularly in the next fourteen or so; it gives the concepts of beauty and time and their interrelationship, as also the emblem of the rose, all of which carry the weight in the other sonnets; and it shows the theme of reproduction, to be taken up in all except one of the sixteen ensuing poems".|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the {{crossover}} as a whole, Oliver Sava at The A.V. Club {{felt the}} episodes did [...] "admirable work advancing the overarching narrative while maintaining each show's distinct perspective" [...] along with being [...] "a {{hell of a}} lot of fun, and it's significantly expanded the scope of the Arrowverse by bringing in an extraterrestrial enemy... There's an entire universe to explore, and this crossover has opened the door for the CW's DC shows to go cosmic in the future." [...] Ed Gross for Empire stated, [...] ""Invasion" [...] is the proverbial mixed bag. As a crossover, it does an extremely effective job in bringing the characters from four different shows together, the rapport between them feeling natural and oftentimes genuinely funny... The real problem with [...] "Invasion" [...] is that it was intended to be, and was promoted as, a massive adventure, but in reality the whole Dominators storyline was rather underwhelming. Part of that is creative – it would have been better to get a fuller understanding of who these beings really are and how they're able to know the long-term effects of Flashpoint; plus the resolution seems awfully pat... and lacks the resolutionary scope that was expected." [...] Despite some of the criticism, Gross gave the crossover 4 stars out of 5. Collider.com's Allison Keene said, [...] "On the positive side, the interactions among cast members of the four shows – Supergirl, The Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow – were as delightful as ever. Though Arrow is often the anchor, The Flash usually <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>for</b> the crossovers, and so the other shows incorporate its light-hearted, witty banter and a fast-paced action and editing... But on the negative side, the crossovers can also starkly highlight each show's weaknesses," [...] concluding, [...] "There are things [...] "Invasion!" [...] as a whole did really well, and others it didn't, with each series' strengths and weaknesses being highlighted and tested. But with each new expansion, there are things the shows can learn from, and it remains fun for fans".|$|E
