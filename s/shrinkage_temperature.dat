50|$|As chrome-tanned {{hides and skins}} {{are called}} wet blue, other forms of tanning like the ones based on alum, zirconium, titanium, iron salts, or a {{combination}} thereof, lead to skins known as wet white. Wet white is also a semifinished stage like wet blue, but is much more ecofriendly. The <b>shrinkage</b> <b>temperature</b> of wet white varies from 70 to 85 °C, while that of wet blue varies from 95 to 100 °C.|$|E
50|$|The acidity of hides {{once they}} have {{finished}} pickling will typically be between pH of 2.8-3.2. At this point the hides are loaded in a drum and immersed in a float containing the tanning liquor. The hides are allowed to soak (while the drum slowly rotates about its axle) and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through the full substance of the hide. Regular checks {{will be made to}} see the penetration by cutting the cross section of a hide and observing the degree of penetration. Once an even degree of penetration is observed, the pH of the float is slowly raised in a process called basification. This basification process fixes the tanning material to the leather, and the more tanning material fixed, the higher the hydrothermal stability and increased <b>shrinkage</b> <b>temperature</b> resistance of the leather. The pH of the leather when chrome tanned would typically finish somewhere between 3.8-4.2.|$|E
50|$|Many tanning {{methods and}} {{materials}} exist. The choice ultimately {{depends on the}} end application for the leather. The most common tanning material is chromium, which leaves the tanned leather a pale blue color (due to the chromium). This product is commonly called wet blue. The hides, when finished pickling, are typically between pH 2.8 and 3.2. At this point, tannery workers load the hides into a drum and immerse them in a float that contains the tanning liquor. The hides soak while the drum slowly rotates about its axis, and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through the full thickness of the hide. Workers periodically cut a cross-section of a hide and observe the degree of penetration. Once the process achieves even penetration, workers slowly raise the float's pH in a process called basification, which fixes the tanning material to the leather—and the more tanning material fixed, the higher the leather's hydrothermal stability and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>temperature</b> resistance. Chrome-tanned leather pH is typically between pH 3.8 and 4.2.|$|E

40|$|When {{designing}} one way slabs in post-tensioned {{beam and}} slab construction, is it acceptable {{to provide all}} of the required continuous <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>temperature</b> reinforce-ment in the beams only? No. It is PTI’s opinion that one-way slab <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>temperature</b> reinforcement cannot be provided by beam tendons alone. Elimination of shrink-age and temperature reinforcement in the slabs of one-way beam-and-slab structures violates {{the requirements of the}} ACI Building Code. Following is a detailed discussion that explains the PTI position. COMMENTARY: ACI CODE REQUIREMENTS Requirements for <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>temperature</b> reinforce-ment in one-way slabs are specified in the ACI Building Code (current edition ACI 318 - 05) 1 in Section 7. 12. Section 7. 12. 1 (see below) states in mandatory language that reinforcement shall be provided for <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>temperature</b> stresses. 7. 12. 1 – Reinforcement for <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>temperature</b> stresses normal to flexural reinforcement shall be provid-ed in structural slabs where the flexural reinforcement extends in one direction only. Either non-prestressed reinforcement (Section 7. 12. 2) or prestressed reinforcement (Section 7. 12. 3) is permitted to be used to satisfy this requirement. The code specifies three criteria when prestressed reinforcement is used. They are repeated below: 7. 12. 3. 1 – Tendons shall be proportioned to provide a minimum average compressive stress of 100 psi on gross concrete area using effective prestress, after losses, in accordance with 18. 6. 7. 12. 3. 2 – Spacing of tendons shall not exceed 6 feet. 7. 12. 3. 3 – When spacing of tendons exceeds 54 in., addi-tional bonded <b>shrinkage</b> and <b>temperature</b> reinforcement conforming to 7. 12. 2 shall be provided between the ten-dons at slab edges extending from the slab edge for a dis-tance equal to the tendon spacing.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Preparation {{procedures}} as well {{as ordinary}} use apparently cause changes in the appearance of Inuit skin clothing.

The skins used for the clothing originate from ringed seal (Phoca hispida) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus). For comparison, freshly prepared skins were studied, as were samples of sealskins found in the mummy burial ground in Qilakitsoq, Greenland. It appeared that ordinary use changed the fatty acid distribution to some extent, {{as well as}} the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>temperature,</b> indicating slow deterioration. However, more significant deterioration was observed for samples exposed for longer periods to daylight as, for example, when placed on exhibition. The effect of light was verified by studying samples deliberately exposed to full daylight for ca. 6 months. In contrast to these samples, the 500 -year-old skins appeared, on the basis of fatty acid distribution and <b>shrinkage</b> <b>temperature,</b> to be in good condition, possibly {{because of the lack of}} ordinary use in combination with low storage temperatures...|$|E

30|$|On {{a higher}} level, {{factors that have}} an effect on the {{structural}} water molecules may disrupt the tight hydrogen bonding network.

As chains are now exposed to a denser water environment, hydrogen bonding becomes more intense, significantly affecting spectral characteristics (as a key feature throughout the results in this work, see “Results and discussion” section). As a result of the various degrading processes, the hydrothermal constant of parchment has been shown to change on the structural and molecular levels. <b>Shrinkage</b> <b>temperatures</b> have been observed to decrease upon exposure of parchment to hydrolytic and oxidative environments [9, 26].|$|R

30|$|<b>Shrinkage</b> <b>{{temperature}}</b> is {{the temperature}} {{at which a}} biomaterial contracts when immersed in water whose temperature is gradually raised (1  °C/min). The unprocessed HAM showed the <b>shrinkage</b> <b>temperature</b> of 75  ±  0.5  °C whereas DHAM recorded a relatively lower temperature of 73  ±  0.4  °C. This slight difference could be because of collagen content, as its denaturation is a relatively slow process compared to other proteins.
