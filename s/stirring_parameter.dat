40|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steels (SS) are alloys {{widely used in}} many applications where high corrosion resistance materials are required, e. g., petrochemicals industries. The influence of iron (ferric) ions in the pickling of AISI 316 L SS was studied using an environmentally-friendly chemical treatment based on sulfuric-hydrofluoric peroxide mixtures. p-Toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA) had {{a positive influence on}} H 2 O 2 stabilization during the first 4 days of experimentation. Temperature and the <b>stirring</b> <b>parameter</b> in the pickling bath had a negative effect on H 2 O 2 stability. Ferric ions had a negative effect on H stability, and a threshold might be defined above which the H 2 O 2 loss increased. Pickling of AISI 316 L SS could be performed using the environmentally-friendly H 2 O 2 mixture. The AISI 316 L SS pickling rate decreased from 2. 6 mg/sq dm day (mdd) in the absence of ferric ions to 0. 2 mdd in the presence of 40 g/L ferric ions for 1 hr at 50 Â°C. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{optimize}} ethanol production in a small glass reactor. The ethanol was produced through simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of steam pretreated spruce. Ordinary commercial yeast was used with a concentration of 5 g/L. The method of pretreatment was steam-explosion with SO 2 as catalyst. The pretreatment liberates cellulose, giving the enzymes better access to the cellulose. The optimization involved modifying heating and stirring. The reactor was provided with a glass jacket allowing it to be heated with a water bath instead of a hot plate. Different stirring speeds were tried and a new stirrer was designed. The new design was also incorporated as a <b>stirring</b> <b>parameter</b> along with the old one. Different concentrations of pretreated material, 7 % & 10 % water insoluble solids (WIS) were used. The more material used in SSF the more ethanol is potentially produced, but both enzymes and yeast are susceptible to inhibitors present in the pretreated material. Best result was achieved with the jacketed reactor with 7 % WIS and slow stirring with the old stirrer; yielding an ethanol end concentration of 29. 9 g/L and a yield of 61. 2 %. The yield in question was the amount of ethanol produced from the pretreated material as % of the theoretical possible based on the hexose content in the raw material. The commercial yeast was found unable to cope with the inhibitory effects experienced with 10 % WIS. The enzymes, on the other hand, retained most of their activity. Even with 7 % WIS reproducibility was poor. However, to draw a conclusion with statistical certainty more experiments are needed...|$|E
40|$|Achieving {{the uniform}} {{distribution}} of reinforcement particles in MMCs {{is very important}} for the effect of <b>stirring</b> <b>parameters</b> and the flow action of the melt, which should be known. The effect of <b>stirring</b> <b>parameters</b> on the distribution of SiC particles in SiCp/A 356 composites was studied by the experimental and numerical methods in this paper. The experimental results show the SiC distribution with different <b>stirring</b> <b>parameters.</b> In addition, the effects of the fluid velocity and volume fraction of SiC particle at different position of crucible on the SiC distribution were analyzed by numerical simulation. The velocity magnitude, axial velocity, and radial velocity were analyzed to explain theoretically the particle distribution. The shearing force, moments, and stirring power of the stirring rod were simulated based on CFD code. The numerical results show that the stirring temperature is lower, the shearing force is greater, the stirring time is longer, and particle dispersion gets better. On the other hand, the higher the stirring speed is, the more uniform the radial and axial flow are, and the better the particles were dispersed. The numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNow-a-days, Aluminum Matrix Composites (AMCs) are {{extensively}} used {{in industrial}} applications. For AMCs, stir casting is the cheapest and most flexible productiontechnique.

In this paper, the stirring action is simulated to correlate with the experimental results. For this a computational model of stir casting is developed. Effect of important <b>stirring</b> <b>parameters</b> such as speed and number of blades in the stirrer are studied. The effectiveness of stirring is quantified based on the shear rate developed in the flow field.

40|$|An {{investigation}} on {{the influence of}} low frequency rotary electromagnetic stirring on solidification structure of austenitic stainless steel in horizontal continuous casting was experimentally conducted and carried out on an industrial trial basis. The results show that application of appropriate electromagnetic <b>stirring</b> <b>parameters</b> can obviously improve the macrostructure of austenitic stainless steel, in which both columnar and equiaxed grains can be greatly refined and shrinkage porosity or cavity zone along centerline can be remarkably decreased due to eliminating intracrystalline and enlarging equiaxed grains zone. The industrial trials verify that the electromagnetic stirring intensity of austenitic stainless steel should be higher than that of plain carbon steel. Electromagnetic stirring has somewhat affected the macrostructure of austenitic stainless steel even if the magnetic flux density of the electromagnetic stirring reaches 90 mT (amplitude reaches 141 mT) in average at frequency f= 3 - 4 Hz, which provides a reference for the optimization of design and process parameters when applying the rotary electromagnetic stirrer...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} two-dimensional turbulence in finite-temperature trapped Bose-Einstein condensates within damped Gross-Pitaevskii theory. Turbulence {{is produced}} via circular motion of a Gaussian potential barrier stirring the condensate. We systematically explore {{a range of}} <b>stirring</b> <b>parameters</b> and identify three regimes, characterized by the injection of distinct quantum vortex structures into the condensate: (A) periodic vortex dipole injection, (B) irregular injection of a mixture of vortex dipoles and co-rotating vortex clusters, and (C) continuous injection of oblique solitons that decay into vortex dipoles. Spectral analysis of the kinetic energy associated with vortices reveals that regime (B) can intermittently exhibit a Kolmogorov $k^{- 5 / 3 }$ power law over almost a decade of length or wavenumber ($k$) scales. The kinetic energy spectrum of regime (C) exhibits a clear $k^{- 3 / 2 }$ power law associated with an inertial range for weak-wave turbulence, and a $k^{- 7 / 2 }$ power law for high wavenumbers. We thus identify distinct regimes of forcing for generating either two-dimensional quantum turbulence or classical weak-wave turbulence that may be realizable experimentally.

40|$|International audienceElectromagnetic technologies, such as {{electromagnetic}} brake and electromagnetic stirring, are two efficient technologies {{to control the}} flow field in slab continuous casting mould. However, up to now there is still an important open problem to be answered firstly. It is that what kind of flow structure is our best choice to get good casting products when we use electromagnetic technologies ? We establish an physical model and an numerical model to study the flow field in slab continuous casting mold with electromagnetic stirring. During our physical experiments, we use liquid mercury as the analogue of liquid steel. In this study, we study the flow field under different casting <b>parameters</b> and <b>stirring</b> currents, respectively.

40|$|In this work, {{the strain}} {{behaviour}} of friction stir processed aluminium superplastic sheet was investigated. The {{aim was to}} study the feasibility of {{the combination of the}} friction stir processing technique with the superplastic forming process. Main friction stir process parameters (tool rotational speed and transverse speed) were varied in order to study the effect of these changes on the strain behaviour and on the formability of the processed sheet. For this purpose, free inflation tests were carried out on the processed sheet at a temperature at which the base material exhibits an optimal superplastic behaviour. A strong influence of the <b>stirring</b> <b>parameters</b> on the strain behaviour of the processed sheet was found denoting only a specified set of friction stir parameters made the processed sheet behave like the base material. The microstructure evolution of the stirred zone {{played an important role in}} this direction. Higher tool rotational speeds led to abnormal grain growth and, consequently, to a slower deformation in the processed material. Thickness measurements made after free inflation tests also confirmed this behaviour: the material processed with a higher tool rotational speed had a thickness that is twice the unprocessed one...|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} the encapsulation of a small, hydrophilic molecule (clonidine) into a PLGA matrix to provide sustained release {{over more than}} one month after intra-articular administration. The microparticles were prepared using a double emulsion (w(1) /o/w(2)) method followed by evaporation of the organic solvent. To optimize the efficiency of encapsulation and the mean size of the microparticles, which was targeted around 30 Î¼m, the following parameters were modulated: the viscosity and {{the volume of the}} organic phase, the molecular weight of the polymer, the volume of the internal and external aqueous phases, the drug loading, the concentration of surfactant, and the <b>stirring</b> <b>parameters.</b> Blends of polymers characterized by different molecular weights (34000 - 96000 Da) as well as copolymers of PLGA-PEG were used to enhance the entrapment of the drug. The pH of the aqueous phases was adjusted to obtain suitable encapsulation efficiency. Characterization was made of the physico-chemical properties of the microparticles, such as their crystallinity (DSC and PXRD) and microstructure (SEM). When performing in vitro dissolution studies, controlled release for up to approximately 30 days was achieved with several of the formulations developed.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{reverberation}} chambers for over-the-air (OTA) testing of wireless devices {{for use in}} multipath. We present a formulation of the S-parameters of a reverberation chamber {{in terms of the}} free space S-parameters of the antennas, and the channel matrix in the way this is known from propagation literature. Thereby the physical relations between the chamber and real-life multipath environments are more easily explained. Thereafter we use the formulation to determine the uncertainty by which efficiency-related quantities can be measured in reverberation chamber. The final expression shows that the uncertainty is predominantly determined by the Rician K-factor in the reverberation chamber rather than by the number of excited modes, assumed by previous literature. We introduce an average Rician K-factor that is conveniently expressed in terms of the direct coupling between the transmitting and receiving antennas (corresponding to a line-of-sight contribution) and Hill's transmission formula (corresponding to a multipath or non-line-of-sight contribution). The uncertainty is expressed in terms of this average K-factor and geometrical mode <b>stirring</b> <b>parameters,</b> showing strong reduction by platform and polarization stirring. Finally the formulations are verified by measurements, and the new understanding of uncertainty is used to upgrade an existing reverberation chamber to better uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAs {{the quality}} of vacuum arc-remelted (VAR) {{zirconium}} ingots is directly linked to their chemical homogeneity and their metallurgical structure after solidification, {{it is important to}} predictively relate these factors to the operating conditions. Therefore, a detailed modeling study of the solidification process during VAR has been undertaken. To this purpose, the numerical macromodel SOLAR has been used. Assuming axisymmetrical geometry, this model is based on the solution of the coupled transient heat, momentum, and solute transport equations, under turbulent flow conditions during the remelting, hot-topping, and cooling of a cylindrical ingot. The actual operating parameters are defined as inputs for the model. Each of them, mainly the melting current sequence, melting rate sequence, and <b>stirring</b> <b>parameters</b> (current and period), is allowed to vary with time. Solidification mechanisms recently implemented in the model include a full coupling between energy and solute transport in the mushy zone. This modeling can be applied to actual multicomponent alloys. In this article, the macrosegregation induced by solidification in a zirconium alloy ingot is investigated. In order to validate the model results, a full-scale homogeneous Zy 4 electrode has been remelted, and the resulted ingot has been analyzed. The model results show a general good agreement with the chemistry analyses, as soon as thermosolutal convection is accounted for to simulate accurately the interdendritic fluid flow in {{the central part of the}} ingot...|$|R

40|$|Beginning with {{motivating}} {{examples of}} chaotic fluid advection applied to control mixing and scalar transport in devices, in biophysical flows, and in environmental and geophysical flows, I discuss basic features and organizing ideas of chaotic advection and transport in planar flows. Due to {{the combination of}} kinematics and continuity, steady planar flows must mix poorly; the flow designer must add some time-dependence that causes streamlines to cross at successive times (a simple though effective heuristic). Unstable manifolds of hyperbolic points in flows are the "highways" along which transport takes place. These structures emerge {{from the way the}} fluid is stirred and change as <b>stirring</b> <b>parameters</b> vary, leading to fractal distributions of transport rates in the control parameter space of flows. This has important implications for designing applications because it means that small variations in parameters can lead to large changes in performance. Optimum designs require knowledge of the complete parametric variation of transport properties for a given flow. As an example, I explore mixing and scalar advection-diffusion transport with the class of periodically reoriented flows, which is often simple to implement for applications, yet imposes, via its symmetries, a rich structure onto chaotic transport that includes generating sub-harmonic resonance "tongues" of the mixing and transport rates in the flows' control parameter space. My objective in this chapter is to impart to the reader the ability to recognize, design, and use chaotic advection to profitably shape and constrain his or her own investigations...|$|R

Time- and space-varying fluid injection from multiple source/sink wells lets us create many different kinds of chaotic flows and chemical concentration patterns. Results of an initial time-dependent potential flow model illustrate that this is a partially open flow, in which parts of the material transported by the flow remain in the cell forever and parts pass through with residence time and exit time distributions that have self-similar features in the control parameter space of the stirring.
