5000|$|On August 19, 1989, a Cessna A185E Skywagon {{registered}} N95KW crashed {{shortly after}} a balked landing at Coastal Airport, located near Myrtle Grove, Florida. The pilot's <b>seat</b> <b>latch</b> {{slipped on the}} railing, causing the pilot to unintentionally stall the aircraft. The pilot and the two passengers on board were all severely injured. The resulting product liability trial, concluding twelve years later, resulted in a $480 million judgement against Cessna. The case was later settled out-of-court for an undisclosed sum. This accident also brought about a series of airworthiness directives that affected all small Cessnas ever built.|$|E

5000|$|Earlier, military-style buckles {{often use}} {{friction}} and {{are designed for}} use with cloth belts or straps. Simple friction buckles are one-piece frames with no prong whatsoever, the strap or belt winding {{through a series of}} slots, and may more technically be called [...] "belt slides" [...] or [...] "belt trims." [...] Although technically not buckles, other fasteners such as plastic [...] "side-clasp" [...] or even <b>seat</b> belt <b>latches</b> are also often used on belts, and colloquially called buckles.|$|R
50|$|Trump {{pushed to}} make the new shuttle a luxury service and a {{marketing}} vehicle for the Trump name. Its aircraft were newly painted in white livery and the interiors redecorated with such features as maple wood veneer, chrome <b>seat</b> belt <b>latches,</b> and gold colored lavatory fixtures. The airline also was {{a leader in the}} adoption of advanced technologies; it introduced some of the first passenger self-service check-in kiosks in coordination with Kinetics at its LaGuardia base and partnered with LapStop, a startup firm which rented laptop computers to passengers.|$|R
5000|$|The 2000 {{model year}} {{introduced}} an emergency trunk release system, child <b>seat</b> anchor brackets (<b>LATCH)</b> {{in the back}} seat, the [...] "Belt Minder" [...] chime to the Crown Victoria (Belt Minder is a seatbelt reminder system that sounds the vehicle's chime when the driver's seatbelt is not buckled).

The 1967 Rambler Americans also included a collapsible, energy-absorbing steering column and steering wheel, more padding on interior surfaces, 4-way hazard flashers, and locking <b>seat</b> back <b>latches</b> for 2-door models. The instrument cluster was changed from the previous rectangular design to round gauges: The speedometer and odometer was center, with twin, smaller fuel and engine temperature gauges, with matching warning-light pods {{on both sides of the}} speedometer.|$|R
50|$|When installed, the <b>seats</b> are <b>latched</b> to {{floor-mounted}} strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lift each seat, {{allowing it}} to be rolled fore and aft.

Additionally, seatbacks were designed to fold forward. Seat roller tracks are permanently attached {{to the floor and}} seat stanchions are aligned, facilitating the longitiudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter.|$|R

5000|$|Drop Stop is {{constructed}} out of black Neoprene filled with polyester fiberfill {{and is about}} 17 inches long. [...] It has a slot sewn into it where the <b>seat</b> belt <b>latch</b> can fit through. This anchors the device, allowing the car seat to slide back-and-forth freely. [...] According to Newburger and Simon, {{the space between the}} center console and the front seats is always in dark shadow and thus the black color of Drop Stop matches any car's interior. Provided the gap between a car's center console and seat is less than 3.5 inches, Drop Stop should fit. However, some cars, for example the BMW M3 and Volkswagen Jetta, donâ€™t have enough space in the gap to fit the Drop Stop in place.|$|R

50|$|Latches in seatbelts {{typically}} {{fasten the}} belt which constrains the occupant {{to the body}} of the car. Particularly in rear <b>seats</b> slightly different <b>latches</b> may be used for each seat in order to prevent adjacent seatbelts from being attached to the wrong point. Inertial seatbelt release is a potential circumstance where, in a collision, the seatbelt latch can unintentionally come loose leading to potential injury of the passenger. An additional risk of seatbelt latches is that in some cases the occupant may believe the latch is secure (e.g., by hearing a characteristic click) when in fact it has not.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{geometric}} feasibility of installing dedicated lower anchors {{in the center}} rear seating positions of vehicles. Analysis {{was based on a}} previous research study in which the lateral spacing of <b>seat</b> belt and <b>LATCH</b> lower anchorages were measured in 85 model year 2010 - 2011 vehicles. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine how many vehicles would have the physical space to incorporate a third set of dedicated lower anchors in the center seating position for child restraint installation. Usability of all of the lower anchors, as well as the seat belts, was also considered. To begin, nine vehicles that currently have dedicated lower anchors in the center position were reviewed. The distances between all seat belt anchors and lower anchors across the vehicle sample were also analyzed to identify spacings that are currently feasible in production. The arrangement of seat belt and lower anchor hardware across the rear seat was also reviewed with respect to usability. Based on these analyses, a lateral distance between the outboard webbing and outboard lower anchor of 75 to 100 mm is common. The suggested minimum distance between lower anchors and seat belt hardware is 25 mm. Based on these dimensions, vehicles with 710 mm or more between the outboard lower anchor centerlines (OBLACL) should have sufficient space to provide three sets of usable, dedicated lower anchors in the right, center, and left seating positions.

5000|$|The MS-8 is a hardtop-style sedan in {{the vein}} of the Toyota Cresta, Nissan Laurel, Honda Vigor, and Mitsubishi Emeraude. Unlike the Cresta or the {{previous}} Persona, however, the MS-8's body has a B-pillar {{that is much}} thicker below the beltline than it is above. Doing so allows the bodyshell more rigidity while still maintaining an airy cabin. Such a B-pillar means that the front seatbelts must be installed below the beltline. The front passenger seat belt tensioner unit, where the seat belt would recoil for storage when not in use, was located inside the rear passenger doors, and the <b>seat</b> belt <b>latch</b> was located on the front headrest support arm, allowing the belt to be properly positioned when the headrest was adjusted for height for the front passenger.The MS-8's interior design has several unique features. The car is only fitted with a 4-automatic gearbox, and the gear shifter is mounted on the dashboard next to the air-conditioning controls. Doing so eliminates the floor console between the front seats, and allows for a split front bench seat. The display for climate control and factory-equipped audio is located atop the dashboard, in a thin slit right before the windshield defroster. The sunroof is very large for its day, extending all the way above the rear seat footwell.|$|R
5000|$|The USA Legacy was {{introduced}} with three trim levels: the Standard, the [...] "L," [...] and the [...] "LS."

If the OBLACL is less than 710 mm, an improvised center LATCH position (permitting use of the inboard lower anchors from the outboard seating positions to secure a child restraint in the center seating position) may be feasible. The maximum spacing of this improvised center LATCH position would be 480 mm. If a vehicle allowed an improvised center LATCH position, placing the inboard lower anchor between the outboard buckle and nearest center seat belt hardware would maximize usability of the seat belt in the outboard seating position and lower anchors in the center seating position...|$|R
40|$|A {{miniature}} {{latching valve}} has been invented {{to satisfy a}} need for an electrically controllable on/off pneumatic valve that is lightweight and compact and remains in the most recently commanded open or closed state when power is not supplied. The valve includes a poppet that is moved into or out of contact with a seat to effect closure or opening, respectively, of the flow path. Motion of the poppet is initiated by electrical heating of one of two opposing pairs of nickel/titanium shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires above their transition temperature: heated wires contract to their remembered length, applying tension to pull the poppet toward or away from the <b>seat.</b> A <b>latch</b> consisting mainly of a bistable Belleville washer (a conical spring) made of a hardened stainless steel operates between two stable positions corresponding to the fully closed or fully open state, holding the poppet {{in one of these}} positions when power is not applied to either pair of SMA wires. To obtain maximum actuation force and displacement, the SMA wires must be kept in tension. The mounting fixtures at the ends of the wires must support large tensile stresses without creating stress concentrations that would limit the fatigue lives of the wires. An earlier design provided for each wire to be crimped in a conical opening with a conical steel ferrule that was swaged into the opening to produce a large, uniformly distributed holding force. In a subsequent design, the conical ferrule was replaced with a larger crimped cylindrical ferrule depicted in the figure. A major problem in designing the valve was to protect the SMA wires from a bake-out temperature of 300 C. The problem was solved by incorporating the SMA wires into an actuator module that is inserted into a barrel of the valve body and is held in place by miniature clip rings...|$|R
50|$|With Generation III, the Chrysler minivans were {{available}} in long- and short- wheelbase models; three- and four-door configurations; and eight different powertrains, including electric and compressed natural gas; on a single, flexible platform.In development for nearly 5 years from early 1990 (full development from 1991) to December 26, 1994 (final design by Don Renkert was approved on September 23, 1991 and frozen in May 1992), the 1996 model was introduced at the 1995 North American International Auto Show using the Chrysler NS platform. Gone were its K-car underpinnings and architecture, replaced with more modern components and Chrysler's acclaimed cab-forward design. It included a number of innovations, including a driver's side sliding door (optional initially, to become standard equipment later), a first for Chrysler and a non-compact minivan for the United States & Canada (the Honda Odyssey had introduced the first four-door non-compact minivan for the United States & Canada in 1994, although the first-generation Odyssey had conventional hinged rear doors). With Generation III, Chrysler introduced a seat management system marketed as Easy Out Roller Seats: When installed, the 2nd and 3rd row seats (either bucket or bench <b>seats)</b> were <b>latched</b> to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lifted each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks had locator depressions for rollers, thus enabling simple installation. Ergonomic levers at the seatbacks released the floor latches single-handedly without tools and raised the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seatbacks were designed to fold forward. Seat roller tracks were permanently attached {{to the floor and}} seat stanchions were aligned, facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter. A conventional door handle and lock was added to the rear hatch, eliminating the confusing pop-and-lift maneuver which had been required on earlier models. The new minivans earned unanimous critical acclaim: the Dodge Caravan was the 1996 Motor Trend Car of the Year, and the vans were on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1996 and 1997.|$|R
5000|$|... 1981's biggest {{news was}} the {{introduction}} of Cadillac's modulated-displacement 368 in3 V8-6-4 engine. Developed by the Eaton Corporation - with design elements that had been tested for over 500000 mi - allowed various engine computers to decide how many cylinders were needed to power the car for optimal fuel economy. The theory was 8 cylinders from a complete stop, 6 cylinders during usual driving, and just four cylinders at cruising speed. The changes in cylinder operation were seamless, and most drivers did not detect any difference in operation. However, in some cases, reliability and component failure led to customer complaints. Cadillac defended its micro-processor controlled powerplant, and even offered special extended warranties to customers. Also available was Oldsmobile's 5.7-liter V-8 diesel engine. The [...] Buick V6, teamed with an automatic transmission, returned for 1981 after a short initial offering {{in the spring of}} 1980. Coupe de Ville was priced at $13,450, while Sedan de Ville, priced at $13,847, now had the unique option of an available automatic seat belt system - the first offered on a GM vehicle. With the automatic shoulder/lap belt system (only for the outboard front seat passengers), the shoulder point was moved from the upper B-pillar to the upper door glass frame, and the belt reel was moved from the floor onto the door itself, installed in the lower corner. With this, you could theoretically leave the <b>seat</b> belt <b>latched</b> at all times, and simply {{get in and out of}} the vehicle without having to unfasten the belt. The $150 option (which would re-appear as standard equipment on the 1990 - 1992 Brougham), was available only on V6-powered Sedan de Villes. The V6 option itself was a $165 credit over the standard V8 in DeVille. A new grille design was made up of small squares, similar to the pattern from 1979, while the same chromed grille surround from 1980 continued. The egg-crate 1981 grille cast was used again for the 1987 and 1988 Cadillac Brougham models. A new Electronic Climate Control panel did away with the slide lever and thumb wheel in favor of a digital display which allowed the driver to set the interior temperature to a single degree - from 65 to 85 (or [...] "max" [...] settings at 60 and 90 degrees). Option groups included the $1,005 d'Elegance package (available on both models), and the Cabriolet package (for Coupe de Ville) at $363. Sales were up slightly from 1980: 89,991 sedans versus 62,724 coupes (figures include DeVille and Fleetwood models).|$|R
