40|$|<b>Swaddling</b> was {{an almost}} {{universal}} child-care practice before the 18 th century. It is still tradition {{in certain parts of}} the Middle East and is gaining popularity in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands to curb excessive crying. We have systematically reviewed all articles on <b>swaddling</b> to evaluate its possible benefits and disadvantages. In general, <b>swaddled</b> infants arouse less and sleep longer. Preterm infants have shown improved neuromuscular development, less physiologic distress, better motor organization, and more self-regulatory ability when they are <b>swaddled.</b> When compared with massage, excessively crying infants cried less when <b>swaddled,</b> and <b>swaddling</b> can soothe pain in infants. It is supportive in cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome and infants with neonatal cerebral lesions. It can be helpful in regulating temperature but can also cause hyperthermia when misapplied. Another possible adverse effect is an increased risk of the development of hip dysplasia, which is related to <b>swaddling</b> with the legs in extension and adduction. Although <b>swaddling</b> promotes the favorable supine position, the combination of <b>swaddling</b> with prone position increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, which makes it necessary to warn parents to stop <b>swaddling</b> if infants attempt to turn. There is some evidence that there is a higher risk of respiratory infections related to the tightness of <b>swaddling.</b> Furthermore, <b>swaddling</b> does not influence rickets onset or bone properties. <b>Swaddling</b> immediately after birth can cause delayed postnatal weight gain under certain conditions, but does not seem to influence breastfeeding parameter...|$|R

5000|$|Ralph Frenken {{has argued}} against Karp’s {{recommendation}} {{of the use of}} tight <b>swaddling</b> and the concept of a [...] "calming reflex." [...] The criticism is that the effect of <b>swaddling</b> is not based on reflexes because (1) a releasing stimulus is missing, because <b>swaddling</b> most probably works by the decrease of proprioceptive and tactile stimulation and (2) the reflex response is missing, because any reflex always consists of a movement released by muscles. The child does not move but falls asleep by <b>swaddling.</b> Additionally, no known reflex alters the state of consciousness, but <b>swaddling</b> obvioulsly does.

50|$|For many centuries, until around 1175, Anglo-Saxon {{and then}} Anglo-Norman women, with the {{exception}} of young unmarried girls, wore veils that entirely covered their hair, and often their necks up to their chins (see wimple). Only in the Tudor period (1485), when hoods became increasingly popular, did veils of this type become less common. This depended greatly from one country to the other. In Italy, veils, including face veils, were worn in some regions until the 1970s. Women in southern Italy often covered their heads to show that they were modest, well-behaved and pious. They generally wore a cuffia (cap), then the fazzoletto (kerchief/head scarves) a long triangular or rectangular piece of cloth that could be tied in various way, and sometimes covered the whole face except the eyes, sometimes bende (lit. <b>swaddles,</b> bandages) or a wimple underneath too.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper by}} Wang et al. is timely {{because of the}} rising {{popularity}} of infant <b>swaddling</b> in Western societies 1, 2. <b>Swaddling</b> involves wrapping or bundling babies in cloth blankets with the arms restrained to dampen the startle response and {{provide a sense of}} comfort. Studies have demonstrated that <b>swaddling</b> promotes sleep consistency and duration while encouraging infants to remain in the recommended supine position during sleep 2, 3. Approximately 90 % of infants in the United States are <b>swaddled</b> during {{the first few months of}} life 3. Traditional <b>swaddling</b> involves wrapping infants with the legs straight and the hips and knees extended. This practice should be discouraged because it increases the risk of developmental dysplasia of the hip and hip dislocation 1. However, many parents learn to <b>swaddle</b> their infant by viewing videos on the Internet, where some videos promote incorrect <b>swaddling</b> 3. Proper <b>swaddling</b> methods restrain the upper extremities but allow hip flexion-abduction and knee flexion 2. The paper by Wang et al. adds new information regarding the potential effects of <b>swaddling</b> on immature hips while further defining the pathomechanics of hip dysplasia. Previous studies in experimental animals have identified prolonged hip and knee extension as a cause of hip dislocation 4 - 6. However, the previous studies used a cast or a pin crossing the joint of a single limb. Wang et al. attempted to reproduce traditional <b>swaddling</b> by wrapping both hindlimbs together with a soft wrap. Thus, both hindlimbs were held in adduction as well as hip and knee extension. In addition, the authors studied three different time periods of swaddling: the first five days after birth, the second five days after birth, and the first ten days after birth.

40|$|CONTEXT: <b>Swaddling</b> is a {{traditional}} practice of wrapping infants to promote calming and sleep. Although the benefits and risks of <b>swaddling</b> in general have been studied, the practice in relation to {{sudden infant death syndrome}} remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The goal {{of this study was to}} conduct an individual-level meta-analysis of sudden infant death syndrome risk for infants <b>swaddled</b> for sleep. DATA SOURCES: Additional data on sleeping position and age were provided by authors of included studies. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies that measured <b>swaddling</b> for the last or reference sleep were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Of 283 articles screened, 4 studies met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: There was significant heterogeneity among studies (I(2) = 65. 5 %; P =. 03), and a random effects model was therefore used for analysis. The overall age-adjusted pooled odds ratio (OR) for <b>swaddling</b> in all 4 studies was 1. 58 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 97 - 2. 58). Removing the most recent study conducted in the United Kingdom reduced the heterogeneity (I(2) = 28. 2 %; P =. 25) and provided a pooled OR (using a fixed effects model) of 1. 38 (95 % CI, 1. 05 - 1. 80). <b>Swaddling</b> risk varied according to position placed for sleep; the risk was highest for prone sleeping (OR, 12. 99 [95 % CI, 4. 14 - 40. 77]), followed by side sleeping (OR, 3. 16 [95 % CI, 2. 08 - 4. 81]) and supine sleeping (OR, 1. 93 [95 % CI, 1. 27 - 2. 93]). Limited evidence suggested <b>swaddling</b> risk increased with infant age and was associated with a twofold risk for infants aged > 6 months. LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity among the few studies available, imprecise definitions of <b>swaddling,</b> and difficulties controlling for further known risks make interpretation difficult. CONCLUSIONS: Current advice to avoid front or side positions for sleep especially applies to infants who are <b>swaddled.</b> Consideration should be given to an age after which <b>swaddling</b> should be discouraged...|$|R

40|$|Background: Hospitalized {{premature}} babies often undergo various painful procedures. Kangaroo mother care (KMC) and <b>swaddling</b> are two pain reduction methods. Objectives: This {{study was}} undertaken {{to compare the}} effects of <b>swaddling</b> andKMCon pain during venous sampling in premature neonates. Patients and Methods: This study was performed as a randomized clinical trial on 90 premature neonates. The neonates were divided into three groups using a random allocation block. The three groups were group A (<b>swaddling),</b> group B (KMC), and group C (control). In all three groups, the heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were measured and recorded in time intervals of 30 seconds before, during, and 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds after blood sampling. The neonate’s face was video recorded and assessed using the premature infant pain profile (PIPP) at time intervals of 30 seconds. The data was analyzed using the t-test, chi-square test, Repeated Measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), Kruskal-Wallis, Post-hoc, and Bonferroni test. Results: The findings revealed that pain {{was reduced to a}} great extent in the <b>swaddling</b> and KMC methods compared to the control group.

30|$|An {{environmental}} factor involves infant transport and clothing. DDH was {{very high in}} Native Americans in earlier studies [6, 73], due to tight <b>swaddling</b> of the infant in most Native American societies.

The opposite likely occurs in United States Black children. In traditional African cultures, children are not <b>swaddled,</b> but, rather, abducted across the mother’s pelvis, which protects the infant from DDH.
