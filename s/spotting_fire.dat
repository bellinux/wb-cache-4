Treatment areas were selected by fire managers from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) based on the threat of fire to communities {{and the need for}} range and wildlife improvement. A fire density grid was derived from the BLM’s fire start layer to identify historically high ignition areas. Fire Family Plus was used to summarize and analyze historical weather and calculate seasonal severity and percentile reports. Information from Fire Family was used in FARSITE and FlamMap to model pre- and posttreatment effects on fire growth, <b>spotting,</b> <b>fire</b> line intensity, surface flame length, and the occurrence of crown fire. This procedure provides managers with a quantitative measure of treatment effectiveness as well as spatial output {{that can be used for}} analyzing fuel treatment effectiveness, burn plan development, NEPA documentation, public education, and etcetera...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems: Mathematical Modeling, 2009 In {{spite of}} {{considerable}} effort to predict wildfire behavior, {{the effects of}} firebrand lift-off and the resulting <b>spot</b> <b>fires</b> on fire propagation are still poorly understood. Horizontal discontinuities termed ???fuelbreaks??? can impede surface fire spread, however long-distance <b>spot</b> <b>fires</b> allow wildfires to ignite and propagate beyond (i. e., jump) fuelbreaks. Current fire behavior programs aid fire managers in predicting potential wild fire behavior, but these programs lack appropriate methods to determine firebrand and <b>spot</b> <b>fire</b> behavior. In this thesis, we developed a cellular automata model integrating key mathematical models and a recent model that determines firebrand landing patterns. Using our model we varied values of wind speed 6 meters above treetop, surface fuel loading, surface fuel moisture content, and canopy base height to examine two scenarios: {{the probability of a}} <b>spot</b> <b>fire</b> igniting beyond a fuelbreak of various widths, and how <b>spot</b> <b>fires</b> affect the surface fire???s rate of spread. This was tested {{in the context of a}} pine forest. Canopy base height had the greatest influence for both scenarios, followed by wind speed 6 meters above treetop, surface fuel moisture content and surface fuel loading. Our results suggest that the average rate of spread with <b>spot</b> <b>fires</b> is constant, and fire managers would benefit from a mathematical model that determines this rate. Since <b>spot</b> <b>fires</b> impact fire propagation updating fire behavior programs utilized by fire managers, or creating a new fire behavior program, is essential to improve wild fire prediction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Spotting {{ignition}} by lofted firebrands is {{a significant}} mechanism of fire spread, as observed in many large-scale fires. The role of firebrands in fire propagation and the important parameters involved in <b>spot</b> <b>fire</b> development are studied. Historical large-scale fires, including wind-driven urban and wildland conflagrations and post-earthquake fires are given as examples. In addition, research on firebrand behaviour is reviewed. The phenomenon of <b>spotting</b> <b>fires</b> comprises three sequential mechanisms: generation, transport and ignition of recipient fuel. In order to understand these mechanisms, many experiments have been performed, such as measuring drag on firebrands, analysing the flow fields of flame and plume structures, collecting firebrands from burning materials, houses and wildfires, and observing firebrand burning characteristics in wind tunnels under the terminal velocity condition and ignition characteristics of fuel beds. The knowledge obtained from the experiments was used to develop firebrand models. Since Tarifa developed a firebrand model based on the terminal velocity approximation, many firebrand transport models {{have been developed to}} predict maximum <b>spot</b> <b>fire</b> distance. Combustion models of a firebrand were developed empirically and the maximum <b>spot</b> <b>fire</b> distance was found at the burnout limit. Recommendations for future research and development are provided...|$|R
50|$|The arsonist, Stan Pattan, started two fires, one {{on private}} land and the other along Alder Springs Road inside the {{national}} forest boundary. He was later convicted and sentenced on two counts of arson.The first fire was quickly suppressed by the Forest Service. The second fire continued burning toward Grindstone Canyon. The <b>fire</b> was <b>spotted</b> and reported mid-afternoon; by evening, it was considered under control.At about 9 pm, though, as detailed in John Maclean's book Fire and Ashes, the wind caused a <b>spot</b> <b>fire</b> north of the road from a burning brand. The plan to bulldoze lines above this fire were not completed as the terrain was too steep for the equipment. Then the wind died down and the <b>spot</b> <b>fire</b> became inactive. With the new weather conditions, a firebreak line was successfully built directly around the inactive <b>spot</b> <b>fire.</b> The wind came up again and changed direction, which started several <b>spot</b> <b>fires</b> west of the crew. All but one of these new fires were extinguished. The men then rested, ate supper, and were in an area {{out of sight of}} the fire front, unaware that a flare-up was occurring until too late.|$|R

50|$|Wildfires have a rapid {{forward rate}} of spread (FROS) when burning through dense, {{uninterrupted}} fuels. They can move as fast as 10.8 km/h in forests and 22 km/h in grasslands. Wildfires can advance tangential to the main front to form a flanking front, or burn {{in the opposite direction}} of the main front by backing. They may also spread by jumping or spotting as winds and vertical convection columns carry firebrands (hot wood embers) and other burning materials through the air over roads, rivers, and other barriers that may otherwise act as firebreaks. Torching and fires in tree canopies encourage spotting, and dry ground fuels that surround a wildfire are especially vulnerable to ignition from firebrands.
