Despite this, the crowds though continued to grow, reaching 40,000 in Des Moines and 50,000 in Milwaukee. He was then scheduled to make an appearance in Topeka on the September 14 and arrived in town a few days early. After a workout on the 12th, he cooled out normally but later started {{to show signs of}} distress. The condition quickly deteriorated and a respected veterinarian diagnosed a <b>strangulated</b> <b>hernia,</b> which had a very high fatality rate at the time since abdominal surgery on horses was not then an option. Hersey sent two telegraphs on hearing the news: one to Savage and the other to the Minneapolis Journal. While Savage rushed to Dan Patch's side, news went out across America that the horse was dying.|$|E

2500|$|Three {{days before}} the fight, Ali needed {{emergency}} surgery for a <b>strangulated</b> <b>hernia.</b> The bout {{would need to be}} delayed by six months. The new date was set for May 25, 1965. But as it approached, there were fears that the promoters were tied to organized crime and Massachusetts officials, most notably Suffolk County District Attorney Garrett Byrne, began to have second thoughts. Byrne sought an injunction blocking the fight in Boston because Inter-Continental Promotions was promoting the fight without a Massachusetts license. Inter-Continental said local veteran Sam Silverman was the promoter. On May 7, backers of the rematch ended the court battle by pulling the fight out of Boston. The promoters needed a new location quickly, whatever the size, to rescue their closed circuit television commitment around the country. Governor John H. Reed of Maine stepped forward, and within a few hours, the promoters had a new site: Lewiston, Maine, a mill town with a population of about 41,000 located [...] north of Boston.|$|E
6000|$|Such a {{systematic}} suppression {{of a specific}} disease or so is really the utmost {{that could be done}} with any confidence at present, so far as the State and collective action go. [Footnote: Since the above was written, a correspondent in Honolulu has called my attention to a short but most suggestive essay by Doctor Harry Campbell in the Lancet, 1898, ii., p. 678. He uses, of course, the common medical euphemism of [...] "should not marry" [...] for [...] "should not procreate," [...] and he gives the following as a list of [...] "bars to marriage": pulmonary consumption, organic heart disease, epilepsy, insanity, diabetes, chronic Bright's disease, and rheumatic fever. I wish I had sufficient medical knowledge to analyze that proposal. He mentions inherited defective eyesight and hearing also, and the [...] "neurotic" [...] quality, with which I have dealt in my text. He adds two other suggestions that appeal to me very strongly. He proposes to bar all [...] "cases of non-accidental disease in which life is saved by the surgeon's knife," [...] and he instances particularly, <b>strangulated</b> <b>hernia</b> and ovarian cyst. And he also calls attention to apoplectic breakdown and premature senility. All these are suggestions of great value for individual conduct, but none of them have that quality of certainty that justifies collective action.] Until great advances are made in anthropology--and at present there are neither men nor endowments to justify the hope that any such advances will soon be made--that is as much as can be done hopefully for many years in the selective breeding of individuals by the community as a whole. [Footnote: If at any time certainties should replace speculations in the field of inheritance, then I fancy the common-sense of humanity will be found to be in favour of the immediate application of that knowledge to life.] At present almost every citizen in the civilized State respects the rules of the laws of consanguinity, so far as they affect brothers and sisters, with an absolute respect--an enormous triumph of training over instinct, as Dr. Beattie Crozier has pointed out--and if in the future it should be found possible to divide up humanity into groups, some of which could pair with one another only to the disadvantage of the offspring, and some of which had better have no offspring, I believe there would be remarkably little difficulty in enforcing a system of taboos in accordance with such knowledge. Only {{it would have to be}} absolutely certain knowledge proved and proved again up to the hilt. If a truth is worth application it is worth hammering home, and we have no right to expect common men to obey conclusions upon which specialists are as yet not lucidly agreed. [Footnote: It has been pointed out to me by my friend, Mr. Graham Wallas, that although the State may not undertake any positive schemes for selective breeding in the present state of our knowledge, it can no more evade a certain reaction upon these things than the individual can evade a practical solution. Although we cannot say of any specific individual that he or she is, or is not, of exceptional reproductive value to the State, we may still be able, he thinks, to point out classes which are very probably, as a whole, good reproductive classes, and we may be able to promote, or at least to avoid hindering, their increase. He instances the female elementary teacher as being probably, as a type, a more intelligent and more energetic and capable girl than the average of the stratum from which she arises, and he concludes she has a higher reproductive value--a view contrary to my argument in the text that reproductive and personal value are perhaps independent. He tells me that it is the practice of many large school boards in this country to dismiss women teachers on marriage, or to refuse promotion to these when they become mothers, which is, of course, bad for the race if personal and reproductive value are identical. He would have them retain their positions regardless of the check to their efficiency maternity entails. This is a curiously indirect way towards what one might call Galtonism. Practically he proposes to endow mothers in the name of education. For my own part I do not agree with him that this class, any more than any other class, can be shown to have a high reproductive value--which is the matter under analysis in this paper-- though I will admit that an ex-teacher will probably do infinitely more for her children than if she were an illiterate or untrained woman. I can only reiterate my conviction that nothing really effective can be organized in these matters until we are much clearer than we are at present in our ideas about them, and that a public body devoted to education has no business either to impose celibacy, or subsidize families, or experiment at all in these affairs. Not only in the case of elementary teachers, but in the case of soldiers, sailors, and so on, the State may do much to promote or discourage marriage and offspring, and no doubt it is also true, as Mr. Wallas insists, that the problems of the foreign immigrant and of racial intermarriage, loom upon us. But since we have no applicable science whatever here, since there is no certainty in any direction that any collective course may not be collectively evil rather than good, there is nothing for it, I hold, but to leave these things to individual experiment, and to concentrate our efforts where there is a clearer hope of effective consequence. Leave things to individual initiative and some of us will, by luck or inspiration, go right; take public action on an insufficient basis of knowledge and there is a clear prospect of collective error. The imminence of these questions argues for nothing except prompt and vigorous research.] ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBy Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) principles, several meta-analyses {{concluded}} {{that use of}} mesh is superior to the non-mesh operations in inguinal hernia surgery. Wound infection is a potential complication of all hernia repairs and deep-seated infection involving an inserted mesh may result in chronic groin sepsis. In the event of incarcerated or <b>strangulated</b> <b>hernias,</b> however; placement of prosthetic material is presumed to increase that risk of infection. AimAim {{of the study is}} to compare the outcome of tension-free mesh repair to Bassini technique used to treat <b>strangulated</b> inguinal <b>hernia.</b> Patients and methodsIn the period from May 2004 to December 2006, 54 patients were submitted to emergency operation because of <b>strangulated</b> inguinal <b>hernia.</b> The patients were randomized into two groups (27 patients in each group). Group A patients underwent open tension-free anterior repair utilizing a monofilament polypropylene mesh according to Lichtenstein “tension-free” technique, whereas group B patients underwent Bassini technique. Mesh hernioplasty was not attempted in patients with preoperative peritonitis, inflammatory hernia and for those in whom bowel resection was perfumed for ischemic necrosis caused by <b>strangulated</b> inguinal <b>hernia</b> and they were excluded from the study. Assessment of the primary outcome included surgical complications and hospital stay and secondary outcome was the recurrence of hernia. ResultsPostoperative complication rate did not differ significantly between the two groups. Postoperative hospital stay was also significantly longer in group B compared to group A (5 ± 3. 4 days versus 3 ± 2. 1 days, p< 0. 01). During the follow-up, (mean 22 ± 6 months), three patients had recurrence after Bassini operation (group B), but there was no recurrent hernia after mesh herniorrhaphy (group A) (0 / 27 = 0 % versus 3 / 27 = 7, 11. 1 %, p< 0. 001).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: De Garengeot hernia {{is a rare}} {{occurrence}} whereby an appendix {{is found}} in a femoral hernia sac. It is rarer still to find an acutely inflamed appendix manifesting itself as a <b>strangulated</b> femoral <b>hernia.</b> This case is important to report as it highlights the diagnostic difficulty this particular condition presents to an emergency surgeon. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report {{the case of an}} 86 year old female who was found to have a De Garengeot hernia containing a necrotic appendix. A retrograde appendicectomy was performed to prevent peritoneal contamination. The hernia defect was repaired using a standard repair with non-absorbable suture. DISCUSSION: De Garengeot's hernia is a rare occurrence, is often unexpected and tends to be diagnosed intra-operatively. Pre-operative diagnosis remains difficult and it will often masquerade as a <b>strangulated</b> femoral <b>hernia.</b> In stable patients, where there is a diagnostic uncertainty CT scanning is a useful adjunct and may allow a laparoscopic approach to be undertaken in the absence of appendicitis. CONCLUSION: A De Garengeot's hernia should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with clinical signs of a <b>strangulated</b> femoral <b>hernia.</b> It is often an incidental finding during an emergency operation. Although mesh repairs in the presence of appendicitis have been reported, the safest approach remains a primary suture repair...|$|R
