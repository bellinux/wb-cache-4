6000|$|There was a moment's silence. (It wasn't {{because he}} had money in it, then, thought Mat, that he <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lid</b> of that big chest of his so sharp. I wonder whether--) ...|$|R
6000|$|He paused, and then, with mingled {{discretion}} {{and pride}} of knowledge, murmured the explanatory word [...] "Camorra" [...] and <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lid.</b> [...] "A very powerful Camorra," [...] he breathed out. [...] "The professors themselves respect it greatly [...] . una lira e cinquanti centesimi, Signor Conde." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let me consult my cap,' {{said the}} frog; {{and taking it}} off she laid it in a box, and threw in after it a few sprigs of juniper, some capers, and two peas, which she carried under her right leg; she then <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lid</b> of the box, and murmured some words which the queen did not catch.|$|R
60|$|Even as {{he spoke}} {{the opening of the}} outside door could be {{distinctly}} heard, then the confused murmur of many voices. Already Blakeney and Ffoulkes had with perfect presence of mind put the finishing touches to the tidying of the room--put the chairs straight, <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lid</b> of the oak chest, closed all the drawers of the desk.|$|R
60|$|With a groan I {{rose and}} opened it. Inside was another box made of silver. This I opened also and {{perceived}} that within lay bundles of dried leaves {{that looked like}} tobacco, from which floated an enervating and well-remembered scent that clouded my brain for a moment. Then I <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lids</b> and returned to my seat.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh!' says t' awd lass; 'the beautee! How sweet he looks!' An' {{just then}} t' beauty snarled an' showed his teeth, so Mulvaney <b>shuts</b> <b>down</b> t' <b>lid</b> and says: 'Ye'll be careful, marm, whin ye tek him out. He's disaccustomed to {{travelling}} by t' railway, an' he'll {{be sure to}} want his rale mistress an' his friend Learoyd, so ye'll make allowance for his feelings at fost.' ...|$|R
6000|$|So Rollo {{went back}} and told the officer {{that he had not}} any thing to declare. He then opened his trunk; but the officer, instead of {{examining}} it, <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lid,</b> saying, [...] "Very well;" [...] and by means of a piece of chalk he marked it upon the top with some sort of character. A porter then took the trunk and carried it back to the train.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not one bit," [...] she {{answered}} still more firmly than before, and, stretching out her hand, she <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lid</b> of the coffer before I could look into it. [...] "It {{may be best}} so, for as it stands the story had a happy ending and I don't want to learn, oh! I don't want to learn how the curse of Isis fell on you and me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] says t' awd lass; [...] "the beautee! How sweet he looks!" [...] An' {{just then}} t' beauty snarled an' showed his teeth, so Mulvaney <b>shuts</b> <b>down</b> t' <b>lid</b> and says: [...] "Ye'll be careful, marm, whin ye tek him out. He's disaccustomed to {{traveling}} by t' railway, an' he'll {{be sure to}} want his rale mistress an' his friend Learoyd, so ye'll make allowance for his feelings at fost." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{he took from}} his bag a {{screwdriver}} and a wrench, and very soon the top {{of one of the}} cases was thrown open. The earth smelled musty and close, but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention was concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then <b>shutting</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lid</b> began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.|$|R
60|$|Captain Daggett drew forth {{his wallet}} and {{discharged}} the obligation on the spot. He then replaced the charts, and, without opening the till of the chest, he <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lid,</b> locked it, and put the key in his pocket, saying that he would cause the whole to be removed, much as if he felt anxious to relieve the deacon of an incumbrance. This done, he asked a direction to the dwelling of the Widow White, with whom he wished to converse, ere he left the Point.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} moment {{he took out a}} garment, which seemed to be a sort of frock. It was made of brown linen. He laid it aside upon a chair, and then began to put the things back into his trunk again. He laid them all in very carefully, each in its own place. When all were in, he <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lid</b> of the trunk, locked it, and put the key in his pocket. Then he took the frock from the chair, and opening it, put it on.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Papa,' she said, all {{mystery and}} whisper, as she <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the tea-pot <b>lid,</b> 'is sitting prosingly {{breaking}} his new laid egg {{in the back}} parlour over the City article exactly like the Woodpecker Tapping and need never {{know that you are}} here, and our little friend you are well aware may be fully trusted when she comes down from cutting out on the large table overhead.' ...|$|R
60|$|Greatly {{interested}} in his proceedings, Mr Swiveller observed him closely. Into one little chamber of this temple, he dropped an egg; into another some coffee; into a third a compact piece of raw steak from a neat tin case; into a fourth, he poured some water. Then, {{with the aid of}} a phosphorus-box and some matches, he procured a light and applied it to a spirit-lamp which had a place of its own below the temple; then, he <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lids</b> of all the little chambers; then he opened them; and then, by some wonderful and unseen agency, the steak was done, the egg was boiled, the coffee was accurately prepared, and his breakfast was ready.|$|R
60|$|He listened {{carefully}} once {{or twice}} after he had <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lid,</b> {{and while he was}} tying the cords over it, to ascertain whether his wild young friend was opening the street door yet, or not. How short a time he had passed in Zack's company, yet how thoroughly well he knew him, not as to his failings only, but as to his merits besides! How wisely he foreboded that his boisterous fellow-lodger would infallibly turn against him as an enemy, and expose him without an instant's hesitation, if young Thorpe got any hint of his first experimental scheme for discovering poor Mr. Blyth's anxiously-treasured secret by underhand and treacherous means! Mat's cunning had proved an invaluable resource to him on many a critical occasion already; but he had never been more admirably served by it than now, when it taught him to be cautious of betraying himself to Zack.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{went to the}} mound," [...] said he, {{speaking}} very rapidly, [...] "and {{when we got to}} the top {{and lifted}} off that stone lid--upon my soul, ladies, I believe there is gold enough in that thing to ballast a ship. It isn't filled quite up to the top, and, of course, I could not find out how deep the gold goes down; but I worked a hole in it as far down as my arm would reach, and found nothing but gold bars like this." [...] Then, glancing around to see that none of the Africans were returning, he took from his pocket a yellow object about three inches in length and an inch in diameter, shaped like a rough prism, cast in a rudely constructed mortar or mould. [...] "I brought away just one of them," [...] he said, [...] "and then I <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lid,</b> and we came away." ...|$|R
60|$|Harold was too {{moved to}} answer, so he {{shouldered}} his last load of treasure and limped off {{with it to}} the house. Mrs. Jobson and her talkative niece were up now, {{but they did not}} happen to see him, and he reached his room unnoticed. He poured the last bagful of gold into the chest, smoothed it <b>down,</b> <b>shut</b> the <b>lid</b> and locked it. Then as he was, covered with filth and grime, bruised and bleeding, his hair flying wildly about his face, he sat down upon it, and from his heart thanked heaven for the wonderful thing that had happened to him.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} I took the {{manuscript}} I had just written, and carefully infolded it in stout wrapping-paper. Then I {{went to a}} neighboring grocery store and bought a small, strong, tin box, originally intended for biscuit, with a cover that fitted tightly. In this I placed my manuscript, and then I took the box to a tinsmith and had the top fastened on with hard solder. When I went home I ascended into the garret and brought down to my study a ship's cash-box, which had once belonged {{to one of my}} family who was a sea-captain. This box was very heavy, and firmly bound with iron, and was secured by two massive locks. Calling my wife, I told her of the contents of the tin case, which I then placed in the box, and having <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the heavy <b>lid,</b> I doubly locked it.|$|R
6000|$|Cain. And I none!--Who {{makes me}} brotherless? [...] His eyes are open! {{then he is}} not dead! [...] Death is like sleep[132]; and sleep <b>shuts</b> <b>down</b> our <b>lids.</b> [...] His lips, too, are apart; why then he breathes; [...] And yet I feel it not.--His heart!--his heart!-- [...] 340 [...] Let me see, doth it beat? methinks----No!--no! [...] This is a vision, else I am become [...] The native of another and worse world. [...] The earth swims round me:--what is this?--'tis wet; [...] [Puts {{his hand to his}} brow, and then looks at it. [...] And yet there are no dews! 'Tis blood--my blood-- [...] My brother's and my own! and shed by me! [...] Then what have I further to do with life, [...] Since I have taken life from my own flesh? [...] But he can not be dead!--Is silence death? [...] No; he will wake; then let me watch by him.

60|$|In a {{few minutes}} the hatches were opened on board the vessel, and the sailors began to hoist out the trunks. As fast as they were brought up to the decks men took them on shore, and carried them into the custom-house by the same door where the {{passengers}} had entered. When all the baggage was carried in, the ropes were taken down, and the passengers went to the custom-house door again, to attend to the examination of the baggage. A soldier stood at the door to prevent too many going in at a time. Mr. George and Rollo followed the rest, and at length it came their turn to have their trunks examined. This was done very quick--the officers appearing to think, from the appearance of the travellers, {{that they would not be}} likely to have any smuggled goods in their possession. The officer, accordingly, just looked into the trunks, and then <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lids,</b> and marked them passed. A porter then took them out at the side door. There, on Mr. George's telling them in French that they were going to Paris by the railroad, the trunks were put upon a cart, while Mr. George and Rollo got into the omnibus, and then they were very soon driving along the quay, in the direction, as they supposed, of the Paris railway station.|$|R
60|$|But we didn't need it. All {{we needed}} was just {{enough for the}} pie, and so we throwed the rest away. We didn't cook none of the pies in the wash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which he thought {{considerable}} of, because it belonged {{to one of his}} ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret {{with a lot of other}} old pots and things that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they warn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first pies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the last one. We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lid,</b> and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope ladder wouldn't cramp him down to business I don't know nothing what I'm talking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time, too.|$|R
6000|$|At length {{the convoy}} (as the French call a railway train) {{came to a}} stand, and an attendant, in uniform, {{opened the door of}} the car. Mr. George and Rollo got out and looked about, quite bewildered with the magnificence of the scene around them. The station was very extensive, and was very splendid in its construction, and there were immense numbers of people going and coming in it in all directions. Still, every thing was so well {{regulated}} that there was no disorder or confusion. There was a line of carriages drawn up in a certain place near the platform; but the coachmen remained quietly by them, awaiting calls from the passengers, instead of vociferously and clamorously offering their services, as is customary at the stations in America. Nor was there any pushing or crowding for trunks and baggage. In fact, the trunks were all to be examined before they could go into the city; for there are separate duties for the city of Paris, in addition to those for France. The baggage was, therefore, all taken from the baggage car, and arranged in an immense apartment, on counters, which extended all around the sides, and up and down the middle; and then, when all was ready, the passengers were admitted, and each one claimed his own. Mr. George and Rollo easily found their trunks, and, on presenting their tickets, an officer required them to open the trunks, that he might see if there was any thing contraband inside. As soon, however, as he perceived that Mr. George and Rollo were foreigners, and that their trunks had come from beyond sea, he <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the <b>lids</b> again, saying, [...] "It is well." [...] A porter then took the trunks and carried them out to a carriage.|$|R
6000|$|Mauduit {{points out}} farther the {{enormous}} fortunes realized by a swindling set of Army-Furnishers, Hebrews mainly, and unbeautiful to look on. Alas, yes; this too {{is a thing}} incident to the case; and in a degree to all such cases, and situations of sudden crisis;--have not we seen Jew Ephraim growing rich by the copper money even of a Friedrich? Christian Protestants there are, withal, playing the same game on a larger scale. Herr Schimmelmann ("MOULDY-man") the Dane, for instance,--Dane or Holsteiner,--is coining false money for a Duke of Holstein-Plon, who has not a Seven-Years War on his hands. Diligently coining, this Mouldy Individual; still more successfully, is trading in Friedrich's Meissen China (bought in the cheapest market, sold in the dearest); has at Hamburg his [...] "Auction of Meissen Porcelain," [...] steadily going on, as a new commercial institution of that City;--and, in short, by assiduously laboring in such harvest-fields, gathers a colossal fortune, 100,000 pounds, 300,000 pounds, or I will not remember what. Gets [...] "ennobled," [...] furthermore, by a Danish Government prompt to recognize human merit: Elephant Order, Dannebrog Order; no Order good enough for this Mouldy-man of merit; [Preuss, ii. 391, 282, &c.]--and is, so far as I know, begetting [...] "Nobles," [...] that is to say, Vice-Kings and monitory Exemplars, for the Danish People, to this day. Let us <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the iron <b>lid</b> on all that.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, upon Stubb {{setting the}} anchor-watch after his supper was concluded; and when, {{accordingly}} Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering three lanterns, {{so that they}} cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea, these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades,* kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks, by striking the keen steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not always hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at each other's disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed {{over and over again}} by the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was this all. It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones, after {{what might be called the}} individual life had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin, one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg's hand off, when he tried to <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> the dead <b>lid</b> of his murderous jaw.|$|R
50|$|An ILS must <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> upon {{internal}} {{detection of}} a fault condition. Higher categories require shorter response times; therefore, ILS equipment {{is required to}} <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> more quickly. For example, a CAT I localizer must <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> within 10 seconds of detecting a fault, but a CAT III localizer must <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> in less than 2 seconds.|$|R

30|$|Table 8 {{also shows}} that for AT&T, the {{percentage}} of <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> links for the best online approach, Online-MO, is around 97.7 % {{of the percentage of}} <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> links observed for Offline-R. Online-MO selects paths that require the fewest number of new links, which decreases the overall percentage of active links. On the other hand, Online-R-LSP randomly selects paths without considering energy consumption. This results in Online-R-LSP exhibiting the smallest percentage of <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> links among the studied approaches, with only 12.2 % of the recorded percentage of Offline-R. For Abilene, Table 9 indicates that Online-R and Online-R-LSP exhibit the best and worst performance, respectively. Specifically, Online-R is able to <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> 24.9 % of the links <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> by Offline-R, whereas, Online-R-LSP only <b>shuts</b> <b>down</b> 1.4 % of the links <b>shut</b> <b>down</b> by Offline-R.|$|R
