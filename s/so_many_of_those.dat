2500|$|Zuel {{felt the}} album [...] "doesn't {{sound like a}} 15-year-old's choice. It is darker and more subdued than her debut, which sold to teens and adults and marked Blasko as an {{intriguing}} rising star; the second album is liberally spotted with regrets, plans for reconciliations and a quest {{to make sense of}} life". Susan Frances at AbsolutePunk.net rates the musicianship and production higher than Blasko's vocals, where [...] " [...] is made up to sound more impressive than she actually is on the album ... a limited range so the tunes have a mundane drone. Her vocal melodies transform the girl next door to a femme fatale figure which may explain why <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> radiant reviews for her album come from male writers". Frances summarises the album as [...] "pleasant and relates to people who are going through a loss or a low point in their lives ... tailored for those going through woeful moods".|$|E
2500|$|Paul proposes sharply {{reducing}} the government's regulation of medications and health supplements by {{reducing the}} role of, and ultimately eliminating, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In a 2011 interview, Paul said, [...] "Well, the FDA just serves the drug companies... they also prevent drugs from coming on the market [...] 10, 15 years later than other countries have it. So, yes, government just {{gets in the way}} on <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> things." [...] He favors allowing FDA-approved prescription drugs to be imported from foreign countries and sold at a lower cost than the same drugs otherwise sell for in the US – thereby allowing international markets to set drug prices in the US market – a practice that has been prohibited by the FDA. In the interest, as he sees it, of fighting for greater freedom of choice for consumers, he has also introduced bills that would significantly reduce the government's ability to prevent manufacturers or sellers of dietary supplements and certain other health products from making what government regulators believe to be false or misleading claims about the health effects of the products. He essentially feels that consumers should be able to buy whatever health aids they want from whomever they want, without the need for guidance by the government.|$|E

As then some parish churches were quite vacant and forsaken, the people made no scruple of desiring such Dissenters as had been a few years before deprived of their livings by virtue of the Act of Parliament called the Act of Uniformity to preach in the churches; nor did the church ministers in that case make any difficulty of accepting their assistance; <b>so</b> that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> whom they called silenced ministers had their mouths opened on this occasion and preached publicly to the people.|$|R

'Why,' inquired the General, 'have you come into my country to burn and kill?' 'I have to obey my orders, and so have you,' retorted the captive sullenly, yet not without a certain dignity. To other questions he returned curt or evasive answers, and volunteered the opinion that all this slaughter would be avenged at Omdurman. He was removed in custody--a fine specimen of proud brutality, worthy perhaps of some better fate than to linger indefinitely in the gaol at Rosetta.|$|R

5000|$|Sweert {{was born}} at Zevenbergen and lived in a period when new plants from across the world were being {{introduced}} to Europe via Dutch, English and French ships. To meet the burgeoning interest in plants by the public, nurseries were being established by wealthy merchants {{in order to meet}} the demand. Botanical illustration suddenly found a new outlet in the production of nursery catalogues. Sweert prepared his Florilegium as a guide of his available stock for the Frankfurt Fair of 1612. The plates, depicting some 560 bulbs and flowers, were from the Johann Theodore de Bry Florilegium which in turn was based on that by Pierre Vallet. His attractively depicted bulbs sparked their popularity, leading to 6 editions of the work between 1612 and 1647, and a demand which would later result in [...] "Tulipomania". At the time of the fair Sweert was in the employ of Emperor Rudolf II as head of his gardens in Vienna. He borrowed freely from plates that had been published before, <b>so</b> that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> that appeared in the Florilegium had been cultivated in the gardens of King Henry IV of France at the Louvre.

40|$|Summary. Conjugation {{and natural}} {{competence}} {{are two major}} mechanisms that explain the acquisition of foreign genes throughout bacterial evolution. In recent decades, several studies in model organisms have revealed in great detail the steps involved in such processes. The findings {{support the idea that}} the major basis of these mechanisms is essentially similar in all bacteria. However, recent work has pinpointed the existence of new, evolutionarily different processes underlying lateral gene transfer. In Thermus thermophilus HB 27, at least 16 proteins are required for the activity {{of one of the most}} efficient natural competence systems known <b>so</b> far. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> proteins have no similarities to proteins involved in natural compe-tence in other well-known models. This unusual competence system is conserved, in association with the chromosome, in all other Thermus spp. genomes so far available, it being functional even in strains from isolated environments, such as deep mines. Conjugation is also possible among Thermus spp. Homologues to proteins implicated in conjugation in model bacte-ria are encoded in the genome of a recently sequenced strain of Thermus thermophilus and shared by other members of the genus. Nevertheless, processive DNA transfer in the absence of a functional natural competence system in strains in which no conjugation homologous genes can be found hints at the existence of an additional and unconventional conjugation mech-anism in these bacteria.

Fellini remembers being fascinated, when still a small boy, by the town's artistic types - bohemian outcasts who were, by turns, dirty, flashy, and inner directed.
