2500|$|Drawbacks of {{hydrogen}} peroxide include material compatibility, a lower capability for penetration and operator health risks. Products containing cellulose, such as paper, cannot be sterilized using VHP and products containing nylon may become brittle. [...] The penetrating ability {{of hydrogen}} peroxide {{is not as}} good as ethylene oxide and so there are limitations on the length and diameter of lumens that can be effectively sterilized and guidance is available from the <b>sterilizer</b> manufacturers. Hydrogen peroxide is primary irritant and the contact of the liquid solution with skin will cause bleaching or ulceration depending on the concentration and contact time. It is relatively non-toxic when diluted to low concentrations, but is a dangerous oxidizer at high concentrations (> 10% w/w). The vapour is also hazardous, primarily affecting the eyes and respiratory system. Even short term exposures can be hazardous and NIOSH has set the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Level (IDLH) at 75 ppm, less than one tenth the IDLH for ethylene oxide (800 ppm). Prolonged exposure to lower concentrations can cause permanent lung damage and consequently, OSHA has set the permissible exposure limit to 1.0 ppm, calculated as an 8-hour time weighted average. <b>Sterilizer</b> manufacturers {{go to great lengths to}} make their products safe through careful design and incorporation of many safety features, though there are still workplace exposures of hydrogen peroxide from gas sterilizers are documented in the FDA MAUDE database. When using any type of gas <b>sterilizer,</b> prudent work practices will include good ventilation, a continuous gas monitor for hydrogen peroxide and good work practices and training.|$|E

2500|$|Ethylene oxide {{treatment}} is generally carried out between 30°C and 60°C with relative humidity above 30% and a gas concentration between 200 and 800mg/l. [...] Typically, the process lasts for several hours. Ethylene oxide is highly effective, as it penetrates all porous materials, {{and it can}} penetrate through some plastic materials and films. Ethylene oxide kills all known microorganisms such as bacteria (including spores), viruses, and fungi (including yeasts and moulds), and is compatible with almost all materials even when repeatedly applied. It is flammable, toxic and carcinogenic, however, with a reported potential for some adverse health effects when not used in compliance with published requirements. Ethylene oxide sterilizers and processes require biological validation after <b>sterilizer</b> installation, significant repairs or process changes.|$|E

A separate wing was added to the hospital building to house the X-Ray machine and laboratory and blood bank. Four new private wards on the male side were constructed at cost of Rs 18,700.|$|E
2500|$|A {{widely used}} method for heat {{sterilization}} is the [...] autoclave, sometimes called a converter or steam <b>sterilizer.</b> Autoclaves use steam heated to 121-134°C under pressure. To achieve sterility, {{the article is}} placed in a chamber and heated by injected steam until the article reaches a time and temperature setpoint. [...] Almost all the air {{is removed from the}} chamber, because air is undesired in the moist heat sterilization process (this is one trait that differ from a typical pressure cooker used for food cooking). The article is held at the temperature setpoint {{for a period of time}} which varies depending on what bioburden is present on the article being sterilized and its resistance (D-value) to steam sterilization. A general cycle would be anywhere between 3 and 15 minutes, (depending on the generated heat) at 121°C at 100 kPa, which is sufficient to provide a sterility assurance level of 10−4 for a product with a bioburden of 106 and a D-value of 2.0 minutes. Following sterilization, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. This may be achieved by gradually depressurizing the sterilization chamber and allowing liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.|$|E

40|$|Ethylene oxide (EtO) {{is widely}} used by health care {{institutions}} as a sterilant because of its potency in destroying pathogens. A few facilities use pure EtO, {{but the vast majority}} employ a “ 12 / 88 ” mixture of Et 0 and Chloroflourocarbon (CFC 1), primarily to improve safety. Use of Et 0 <b>sterilizers</b> is of regulatory concern because:. Et 0 is flammable and explosive. Et 0 is a probable human carcinogen. Et 0 is a toxic air contaminant. CFC is an ozone depleter Pure Et 0 is a colorless gas at room temperature. It has an extremely wide explosive range of 3 to 100 volume percent in air. The flash point is- 4 0 F (Sax, 1984). California classifies Et 0 as a toxic air contaminant, and regulates emissions <b>sterilizers</b> accordingly. At present, EPA does not regulate Et 0 <b>sterilizers.</b> However, the phase-out of CFCs will affect a majority of the users. In Southern California, the use of CFCs as a diluent must cease by January 1, 1997 (SCAQMD 1990). Switching from 12 / 88 to pure Et 0 would permit continued usage of this chemical, but would greatly increase the safety hazard. This fact sheet presents some of the environmental issues with Et 0 <b>sterilizers</b> and presents some alternatives to the use of Et 0 as a sterilant.

2500|$|Ozone {{offers many}} {{advantages}} as a sterilant gas; ozone {{is a very}} efficient sterilant because of its strong oxidizing properties (E = 2.076 vs SHE) capable of destroying {{a wide range of}} pathogens, including prions without the need for handling hazardous chemicals since the ozone is generated within the <b>sterilizer</b> from medical grade oxygen. The high reactivity of ozone means that waste ozone can be destroyed by passing over a simple catalyst that reverts it to oxygen and ensures that the cycle time is relatively short. The disadvantage of using ozone is that the gas is very reactive and very hazardous. The NIOSH immediately dangerous to life and health limit for ozone is [...] smaller than the [...] IDLH for ethylene oxide. Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH): NIOSH Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values (as of 3/1/95) and OSHA has set the PEL for ozone at [...] calculated as an [...] time weighted average (29 CFR 1910.1000, Table Z-1). The Canadian Center for Occupation Health and Safety provides an excellent summary of the health effects of exposure to ozone. The sterilant gas manufacturers include many safety features in their products but prudent practice is to provide continuous monitoring to below the OSHA PEL to provide a rapid warning {{in the event of a}} leak. Monitors for determining workplace exposure to ozone are commercially available.|$|E
