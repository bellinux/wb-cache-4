40|$|The <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> grows {{throughout}} savanna {{areas of}} West Africa and is prized {{for the oil}} extracted from its nuts, and {{for the sale of}} the nuts themselves. Unfortunately, processing and marketing difficulties mean that only 40 % of the produce is used profitably. The <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> (Butyrospermum parkii) grows in the semi-arid zone from the east of Senegal to the south of Chad, and is found mainly in Mali and Burkina Faso and in northern parts of Cote d'lvoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria. It is a small tree with a short trunk and dark green leaves, but its fruit has amazing potential. The population density may be around 50 to 60 trees per hectare in remote areas, but this decreases sharply in populated districts. The fruit is picked up from the ground by women who extract a high-quality pure oil by grinding the nuts with a pestle and mortar. With this they make the prized shea butter, which is much sought after throughout Africa, either for their own consumption or for sale at markets. When the harvest is plentiful the women contract to sell the nuts or the butter to traders, and this is often their only source of ready cash. Indeed, Olivier Krugg, who has made a study of the <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> for the Centre d'Echange et Promotion des Artisans en Zones a Equiper (CEPAZE) in Mali, says: 'The <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> provides more than half the income of village women in these areas. ' Shea butter is not only used widely in cooking: it also has cosmetic and pharmacological uses in treating colds and sprains, promoting the healing of wounds, and as a beauty product. Its by-products are also useful: the pulp and the shell make a waterproof material used on the walls of huts, farmers spread them as fertilizer, or burn them as fuel. A multi-purpose tree Shea butter also has industrial value in the North: it {{can be used as a}} cocoa butter substitute, for coating in chocolate manufacture, and in the cosmetic industry. It has highly desirable softness and smoothness, and pharmacologists recognize its healing and protective powers for the skin. Despite this multiplicity of potential uses, around 60 % of the harvest rots in the bush, according to the experts, mainly as a result of several factors which hamper processing and commercial exploitation. Bernard Clamagirand, Director of CEPAZE, who has been working for some years on small-scale centrifugal processing machinery, says 'Shea butter nut is extremely difficult to process. The nuts contain a gummy substance which clogs the sieves and and other parts of the machine. ' The latest processing machine, the Mockarite, is still at the experimental stage but looks promising. Small or large-scale production? Similar problems are encountered on an industrial scale in the processing plants of Mali, Burkina Faso and Benin. The presses will clog in exactly the same way if the women deliver nuts which are incompletely dried. Furthermore, shea butter trees crop very irregularly (see box), which means the presses can lie idle for two or three years, adding to economic difficulties. The main producer countries are now trying to establish marketing strategies which will exploit the <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> more fully. In Burkina Faso, Togo and Benin, harvesting and marketing have been nationalized, though in Mali and Cote d'Ivoire they have been left in the hands of private enterprise. Only time will tell which policy is the most effective.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Shea</b> <b>butter</b> is the fat {{extracted}} from the nut of Africa Shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa). It is used in cosmetic formulations and {{as a substitute for}} Cocoa butter in chocolate industries. It is edible and used cooking fat in Africa. The saponifiable fraction of <b>Shea</b> <b>butter</b> is composed primarily of stearic and oleic acids with lesser amounts of palmitic, linoleic and arachidic acids while the unsaponifiable fraction of <b>Shea</b> <b>butter</b> is composed of bioactive substances that are responsible for <b>Shea</b> <b>butter’s</b> medicinal properties. <b>Shea</b> <b>butter</b> is a solid at room temperature and melts at body temperature. It is therefore useful for skin care as it has sun screening properties and acts as an emollient and skin moisturizer.

40|$|The {{population}} of <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> (Vitellaria paradoxa C. F. Gaertn.) —a priority tree with enormous {{economic and cultural}} values to the parkland communities in Uganda, is rapidly declining due to rapid human population growth, increasing land fragmentation, and high demand for woodfuel especially charcoal. Reversing this trend {{will depend on the}} rural community involvement in the planting, facilitating natural regeneration, and tending of shea trees on farm. As such a survey was conducted in Amuria district, eastern Uganda, to assess local strategies and constraints to on-farm management of shea trees, and document socio-demographic factors influencing the on-farm conservation. About 93 % of the households protected naturally regenerated V. paradoxa trees mainly on farms. V. paradoxa was mostly propagated through coppices and seedlings. Although insecure land tenure, insecurity, pests, disease, and shortage of planting materials were reported as major hindrances, farmsize, family size, and gender significantly (P≤ 0. 05) influenced people’s willingness to conserve V. paradoxa. Byelaws and policies on shea conservation need to be properly enforced, and further propagation research is required especially towards shortening the juvenile period of V. paradoxa so that more farmers can start propagating the tree other than relying on its natural regeneration...|$|E
40|$|The {{ecological}} adaptation of shea butter trees was assessed {{based on their}} dendrometric and production traits in four <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> parks occurring in different climatic zones of Bénin. A total of 99 rectangular plots of 50 × 30 m were established within the four parks according to a random sampling scheme. In each plot, all trees with a diameter at breast height (dbh) > 10 cm were inventoried and measured for stem and crown diameters, and total height. The production of 120 productive shea butter trees was quantified. Collected data were used to compute structural parameters for each park. Moreover, stem diameter and height structures of the trees were established. Principal component analysis {{was performed on the}} dendrometric variables, and the first three components were correlated with the climatic parameters. Results revealed significant differences between parks in most of the dendrometric and production parameters of shea butter trees. For all the four parks, stem diameter and height structures present a Gaussian shape with left dissymmetry.

The soil water content appeared to be higher under the ball canopy than the brush canopy in August and September, because {{of the importance of the}} shading due to the ball canopy, which contributes to reduce transpiration of the crop and evaporation of water from the soil.

40|$|Combining {{antibiotics}} with resistance reversing agents {{is a key}} {{strategy to}} overcome bacterial resistance. Upon screening antimicrobial activities of plants used in traditional medicine, we found that a leaf dichloromethane extract from the <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> (Vitellaria paradoxa) had antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with further evidence of synergy when combined with β-lactams. Using HPLC-MS, we identified ursolic (UA) and oleanolic acids (OA) in leaves and twigs of this species, and quantified them by HPLC-UV as the major constituents in leaf extracts (21 % and 6 % respectively). Both pure triterpenic acids showed antimicrobial activity against reference and clinical strains of MRSA, with MICs ranging from 8 – 16 mg/L for UA to 32 – 128 mg/L for OA. They were highly synergistic with β-lactams (ampicillin and oxacillin) at subMIC concentrations. Reversion of MRSA phenotype was attributed to their capacity to delocalize PBP 2 from the septal division site, as observed by fluorescence microscopy, and to disturb thereby peptidoglycan synthesis. Moreover, both compounds also inhibited β-lactamases activity of living bacteria (as assessed by inhibition of nitrocefin hydrolysis), but not in bacterial lysates, suggesting an indirect mechanism for this inhibition. In a murine model of subcutaneous MRSA infection, local administration of UA was synergistic with nafcillin to reduce lesion size and inflammatory cytokine (IL- 1 β) production. Thus, these data highlight the potential interest of triterpenic acids as resistance reversing agents in combination with β-lactams against MRSA...|$|E
30|$|The recent {{declaration}} of list of drug resistant priority pathogens by WHO urging R&D {{to develop new}} antimicrobials, highlights {{the urgent need for}} addressing the issue of antimicrobial resistance. Incidentally as per World Health Organization (WHO) list, carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae viz., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli belongs to the high priority category, which requires urgent attention by researchers to develop new antimicrobial agents or resistance modulatory agents. Pentacyclic triterpenoids such as oleanolic acid and ursolic acid and their derivatives were discovered earlier as potential alternatives to antibiotics against a broad spectrum of pathogens (Wolska et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2016). Ursolic acid was shown to display anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis activity and immune-stimulatory activity by decreasing the microbial load in TB induced mice. Ursolic acid derivatives were also reported earlier to inhibit multidrug resistant E. coli when used in combination with kanamycin (do Nascimento et al. 2014) and were also shown to inhibit acrAB mediated efflux of nalidixic acid in E. coli. Ursolic and oleanic acids were earlier reported to synergize with beta lactam antibiotics against gram positive pathogens S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Listeria monocytogenes (Kurek et al. 2012). In a recent interesting study, ursolic and oleanic acids present in dichloromethane extract of <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> were shown to synergize with ampicillin and oxacillin against MRSA and cause reversion of MRSA phenotype which was attributed to delocalization of PBP 2 from the septal division site leading to disturbance in peptidoglycan synthesis, in addition the triterpenoids also caused indirect inhibition of β-lactamases and reversed β-lactam resistance in MRSA (Catteau et al. 2017). To the best of our knowledge, ursolic acid was not reported to interact synergistically with colistin in bacteria. We are reporting {{for the first time that}} ursolic acid can reverse colistin MIC in eight non replicate clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae viz., K. pneumoniae and E. coli.|$|E
40|$|For the {{successful}} cultivation of most undomesticated fruit trees such as <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> (Vitellaria paradoxa C. F. Gaertn.), {{there is a}} need to identify their nutrient requirements and optimal growth conditions. Responses of shea seedlings to combined N and P fertilization, and to inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi was investigated. Six months old shea seedlings were transplanted into pots and grown for six months using a sterile nutrient-deficient soil. The seedlings were inoculated with the AM fungus Glomus intraradices Schenk & Smith. The fertilization treatments consisted of a factorial combination of three levels of N supplied as NH 4 NO 3 -N and P supplied as Ca(H 2 PO 4) 2. Fertilization stimulated plant height, collar diameter and dry weights (DWs) compared with non-fertilized treatments. These improvements were associated with an increase in total shoot N and C uptake (33 % increase) whereas P and K contents were not affected. There was significant N x P interaction on DWs and total shoot N and C contents, suggesting that seedling N responses were influenced by P rates. Consistent N responses in DWs, and total shoot N and C uptake were significant at the lowest P rate. P increases promoted growth and total shoot nutrient contents in low N-treated seedlings, while reducing growth in higher N rates. The combined application of medium and high rates of N and P fertilizers showed relatively low impact on seedling growth presumably because of suboptimal N:P ratios. Mycorrhizal root colonization was generally low (≤ 12 %) and was not affected by any of the treatments. There was also no response to inoculation with AM fungi probably because the established mycorrhizal association was ineffective. The potential use of both mineral fertilizers and AM fungi to promote growth performance of shea seedlings are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The oil-producing {{trees of}} the Sahel was the theme which drew 30 specialists to Bamako, Mali, in duly 1992 for a meeting {{organized}} by the French Ministry of Cooperation and Development. The aim was to decide which species could be marketed, and what research remained to be done. The <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree,</b> the physic nut tree, balanites, argan, neem, moringa are all Sahelian trees which produce a top-quality oil and flourish on poor, stony soil in areas of minimal rainfall. Africans have long {{been aware of the}} properties of these oils, from which the women make butter, cosmetic creams, cooking oils, insecticides and medicines. Across the Sahel the women gather in the nuts, roast or dry them in the sun, then pound and mix them for hours. Part of the oil extracted is for family consumption, and the rest is sold for cash. Multi-use species New uses for these tropical trees are being constantly discovered. Shea butter is used in the treatment of bronchitis and heals sprains and burns; neem kills insect pests; moringa seeds have properties which clarify muddy or cloudy water; balanites oil has amazing cosmetic properties; and oil from the physic nut can be used as engine fuel. The plants, however, are irregular in their growing and fruiting cycles: for example, the <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> fruits only every two to three years, and the argan tree will grow only in the wild. In order to see which of the products of these plants could be marketed and what further research was called for, the French Ministry of Cooperation and Development organized a gathering of 30 experts on oil seed trees in the Sahelian regions. The meeting, called Oleasylva, was held in Bamako Mali in July 1992. At this meeting the delegates explored the concept of marketing, which was new to most of them. The organizer, Arthur Riedacker, sees signs of a new direction 'We have to adopt an entirely new approach at this meeting. Previously, we geared our research to one particular tree and then looked at how we might increase production, but now we must first find out whether it is marketable or not. If the answer is 'yes', then research can get under way. ' The gathering was attended by 30 delegates among whom 15 were African from 1 countries. Technicians, manufacturers, dealers, chemists and end-users were present One problem which occupied much of the time was that of processing kernels. '`The reason we are here is to decide on the action we are going to take, and to find the an swers to our questions from the facts at our disposal,' said Professor Dan Dicker, Director of the CRES (a regional centre for solar energy), who was hosting the work shop. Various views were exchanged among delegates: for example, Hieke Osterman, a neem specialist, suggested that leaving some of the neem shell mixed with the kernel in the press increases the pressure and allows more oil to be extracted. Many problems remain unsolved The processing is a mammoth task, requiring eight hours of manual labour to extract one litre of shea butter oil, and ten hours for one litre of argan oil. These domestic production techniques cannot keep up with current requirements and neither can the productivity of the trees themselves. Balanites and neem only bear fruit after rainfall and the unpredictability of the weather makes it extremely hard to have any confidence in the ability to supply a market. Furthermore, if processing is not carried out correctly the oils quickly go rancid and smell disgusting. There are also difficulties at pressing because some seeds contain a substance which blocks the filters, or because the shell does not come away from the kernel. Unhelpful legislation On the international market, especially in Europe, legislation causes difficulties. `'At present shea butter is banned in the manufacture of chocolate in most European countries,' explains Jean-Jacques Pesquet of APROMA (a French association for the promotion of raw materials). 'It can be used only for coating, and cocoa is used in preference because of its quality. Up till now this ban has been violated by many manufacturers because shea butter is much cheaper than cocoa. But that is no longer the case, and it is pointless continuing the fraud. ' Today 97 % of shea butter exports are used in the food manufacturing industry. The question now is whether legislation will change in the near future, or whether the brokers will direct these products towards the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries instead. 'We have to act quickly,' urges Arthur Riedacker; 'the chemical industry can substitute synthetic products for these natural ones, and it is far harder to halt the use of a substance once in production than to get it adopted. ' But neither the market nor the desert can wait for long. The organizer of the workshop, which was held as part of the 'Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel' projects, reminded those present; 'the only way to stop desertification is to protect the vegetation.

The cashew (Anacardium occidentale) is the most widely grown nut, excepting coconut and oilpalm which are in a different crop category. It originated in the American tropics from Mexico to Brazil, but has long since spread successfully to many lowland tropical areas in Africa and Asia. The largest African producers of cashews are Mozambique and Tanzania with smaller amounts being produced in Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Nigeria and Senegal. But there is much greater potential for this crop. The nuts have a high export value, while the cashew apple can be consumed fresh or dried (See Spore 35 page 4). The shell of the nut yields phenol-containing oils which are used for preserving, waterproofing and, after distillation, for brake-linings, inks and cements. The cashew grows on relatively dry and infertile soils but requires high temperatures and no rainfall during flowering and harvesting in order to produce optimum yields. Since harvesting is by hand, plentiful, inexpensive labour is essential. This is true of most nuts and fruits and may be seen as advantageous since harvesting provides an income opportunity in rural areas. Processing is necessary to remove the cashew shell nut liquid which can blister human skin. In the past, East African output was shipped to India for processing but now processing plants are being built in Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania. The macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia) is a more recent arrival in Africa, having originated in Australia. Macadamias require a frost-free sub-tropical climate with at least 125 cm of well-distributed rainfall per year. They will grow {{on a wide variety of}} soils if drainage is adequate. However, wind is a hazard: the wood is brittle, and where there are strong winds plantations must be protected by windbreaks. Nuts of the wet tropics The kola nut (Cola nitida), dike nut (Irvingia gaboneusis) and njansan (Ricinodendron africanum) all grow in wet forest regions but the kola is the most widely grown; it is widely traded as a bitter chewing stimulant. The kola is still mainly harvested from forests but is increasingly planted in orchards, in cocoa plantations and among coffee. The tree is slow growing and only comes into full production in about the twentieth year. The dike nut matures in seven years and although exploitation is still limited to selfplanted trees the dike seems suitable for planting in hedges, wooded areas, mixed orchards and pure groves. The fruit looks like a small mango and can be eaten in the same way but it is the kernels that are most esteemed: when heated they yield a thick oil. The kernels are also ground to make a paste for thickening stews in the same way as the groundnut and njansan. Njansans are tall trees producing fruits with kernels that have several culinary uses. They can be eaten grilled or ground into a paste and oil can be extracted from the kernels. Most exploitation is from the wild but trees are now being planted deliberately in some regions. Nuts for arid regions The mongongo nut (Ricinodendron rauteanenii from the Kalahari and the ye-eb (Codeauxin edulis) from Somalia are staples of local diet in very arid regions and the practicality of these species being planted as desert orchards in their countries or origin and elsewhere is being investigated. Germination and seedling health remain problematic. Yosef Mizrahi, Professor of Plant Physiology and Horticulture at the Ben Gurion University, Israel found that of a thousand mongongo nuts not one germinated. However, his team subsequently discovered that just one minutes' exposure to ethylene was enough to trigger germination in 80 - 100 % of mongongo seeds. The Ben Gurion team also had problems with propagating ye-eb: while the seeds germinated well and developed in a nursery, they failed to thrive when planted out in orchards. The ye-eb develops long roots as a young seedling and this can be damaged very easily at transplanting. An arid land species which is much more widely exploited, although again there have been difficulties domesticating it as orchard plantings, is the <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> (Butyrospermum parkii). The shea nut is used throughout the Sahel for food and as a raw material for cosmetics and medicines. It has considerable economic potential (Spore 32). At a time when tree planting is being promoted widely in most parts of the tropics there is ample evidence to suggest that one or more species of nuts may be suitable candidates for selection. Perennial species require little cultural attention and most nut species appear to thrive on poor soils with little or no demand for agrochemical inputs. They deserve more attention than they have received in the past. Most nuts are highly nutritious and some have a high sale value. Cashew and macadamia are much in demand for export while other kinds of nuts are produced more locally and may be unknown outside a particular region. Some of these also have the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|One often {{hears about}} new plant {{varieties}} that are reputed to make deserts bloom and bank accounts blossom. But such dreams rarely come true {{in the real}} world. Such {{was the case with}} jojoba and guayule, exotic plants which did not fulfil the great expectations which were based on them. That is one reason why more attention is now at last being given to native trees that have already proved their worth. Only a few years ago, jojoba was being promoted by Third World activists and environmentalists as a miracle plant. Considered by some as a 'way to stop desertification' or as 'liquid gold', it was also supposed to save whales from extinction. Such a reputation naturally attracted media attention which made it front page news. Planting jojoba in the Sahel thus became good not only for the Sahel but for the world at large. Some groups or NGOs {{even went so far as}} to adopt it as their main goal. Such enthusiasm was not without foundation as Simmondsia chinensis or jojoba without dou bt has many advantages. This bushy species actually does grow well in very dry areas such as the deserts of Mexico or Arizona, its native region. An annual rainfall of 100 - 500 mm is all it needs to grow. It is resistant to both heat waves and temperatures approaching freezing and demands little in the way of soil fertility as long as it has good drainage. When it is about five years old and three metres high, this undemanding shrub begins to produce pods containing oily seeds. These can be used to produce an oil that is, above all, an excellent lubricant because it keeps its viscosity even at high temperatures. As with the whale oil that is normally used, it performs extremely well in gear boxes and transmissions. There are also other uses in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and even food industries. Jojoba oil also has the advantage of keeping a long time without going rancid. On the basis of such promising information, many people believed that one only needed to plant jojoba to regenerate the Sahel and thereby increase the incomes of poor farmers and reducing the debts of their countries. Unfortunately, there is often a big difference between what is supposed to happen and what actually happens. To date, not a single jojoba bush has borne fruit in West Africa. It has now been realized that the climate in the Sahel is hardly appropriate for this plant. Trials that were done in Senegal, and repeated in Australia, confirmed that to blossom and produce fruit the jojoba needs winters that are both cool and humid! Furthermore, it responds better to alternating periods of short and long days, preferably with large temperature differences. In other words there are major problems with growing this plant in the Sahel. To add to these biological problems, there are also difficulties in getting farmers to plant jojoba, even along side their food crops. Even if it does grow, it must be protected for several years from livestock (who adore it) before one can hope to reap any benefits. But without fertilizers or irrigation, yields remain very low and quite insufficient to persuade farmers to grow it. After all, they can hardly be expected to include the whale conservation factor in their calculations! Launching grandiose development programs based on jojoba can thus be compared to building castles in the air [...] . On the other hand, it would be unfortunate to abandon jojoba completely. But more detailed studies are needed to determine what can reasonably be expected from growing this crop in Africa. First of all, selection trials are necessary to find productive varieties best adapted to the climates of each region. Attention must also be given to cost-effective production systems that are easy for farmers to develop. For the moment, it is primarily the USA and Israel that are working with experimental plantations but they are limited by high labour costs, particularly of harvesting. Only Latin America currently seems to have all the conditions needed to make jojoba worth growing. Despite these difficulties, the jojoba fad continues to interest people and not a week goes by without a specialized documentation centre receiving a request for information on this plant. In France, a company has even started the in vitro reproduction of jojoba and some farmers in the Mediterranean region have started experimenting with it. Jojoba has thus become the perfect example of one of those plants that economic or political factors have pushed to the forefront as a 'miracle' species before any long-term tests have been done. It was the projected shortage of traditional petroleum-based lubricants that prompted the USA to do research on jojoba in the same way that it was the supply problems of rubber latex during World War II that resulted in research being done on another rubber olant. the auavule. Broken promises The bushy guayule plant, which is native to Latin America, contains latex in its cells rather than in lactiferous channels as is the case with rubber trees. The proportion of rubber compared to the dry weight of the plant ranges from 10 % in wild plants to as high as 25 - 35 % in cultivated plants. To extract it, the plant must be uprooted as it cannot be tapped. As with jojoba, guayule also grows in arid zones. It can survive with 250 mm of rain per year but it grows better with 450 mm. Could guayule be the rubber tree of the desert or the industrial plant that arid regions have yet to find? In northern Cameroon and in Senegal the hopes did not last long. The guayule shoots grew well during the first year or two but then died. They needed a cold winter which is difficult to reproduce in the southern Sahara. On the other hand, the Morrocan climate seems more promising and an experimental plantation of 40 hectares has been established. Generally speaking, these American species have not lived up to expectations in crossing the Atlantic. Adapting plants to new climates is no easy task and certainly cannot be done as rapidly as one often thinks. The American continent has already provided many useful species to Africa, such as maize and cacao, but many years were needed to ensure the adaptation and distribution of such crops. While the future potential of so-called miracle plants deserves attention, they should not be considered as overnight solutions to already pressing problems. Unfortunately, common African plants have attracted very little mei die attention. The disappointment caused by the failure of introduced species and a better evaluation of the conditions needed for development, however, have provoked new interest in the potential of trees that have been firmly rooted in African soil for centuries. Physic nut, Jatropha curcas L. which grows throughout the tropics has recently emerged from the shadows. This hardy tree stands up well to droughts and poor soils. It is traditionally grown in hedges (because animals avoid it), cut for fuel wood, or used for its many medicinal qualities well known to local people. Above all, physic nut produces oilrich seeds for about 50 years once it is established after four or five years of growth. Until the last World War, this oil was used to make laundry soap and candles. Studies also showed that it could be used to fuel diesel engines. But the development of the petroleum industry soon dissipated what limited interest had been shown in this little tree found in arid zones. The oil crisis, however, sparked new interest in this plant. Recent studies have confirmed old data: physic nut oil can, without any special treatment, replace diesel oil in small motors. The fuel consumption is somewhat higher but the power generated is about the same. This local energy source could be very useful in fuelling pumps, mills and small agricultural motors. It is easy to produce as the physic nut grows readily and its oil can be extracted without any major problems. Small processing units can even be established at the village level. This multipurpose tree has thus many advantages for farmers. Those in Cape Verde were among the first to recognize its value and to start growing it. On plots abandoned for growing annual crops, more than 100, 000 physic nut seedlings are being planted. They act as wind breaks, help prevent soil erosion and increase the water retention capacity of the soil. Periodic trimming also generates a supply of fuel wood. But it is the projected production of soap and fuel that prompted people to invest in this crop. Part of the oil will eventually enable the production of 4. 5 t of soap per year, enough to satisfy the demands of about 120 families. Another part will fuel the 22 kw motor powering the semi-industrial processing equipment. The rest will be used to fuel a generator capable of providing the basic electricity needs of an entire village. It could also be used in homes to reduce fuel wood consumption and to replace the lamp oil used for lighting. Such developments have already begun and the first results are encouraging. By exploiting it in this way, physic nut can become an inexpensive and easily integrated tool for local development, particularly for promoting small industry. To optimize its potential, research remains to be done on selecting more productive varieties, developing better cultivation techniques and experimenting with simple yet efficient processing systems. The gum tree The gum acacia, familiar to people in the Sahel, is also benefiting from a revived and long overdue attention. Growing throughout the Sudan-Saharan region, this multi-purpose tree joined the ranks of others that, weakened by droughts and overcutting, slowly disappeared from the landscape. About 4 - 6 m tall, this thorny tree is specially known for its golden pink excretions, the famous Arabic gum. But it is also a source of forage favoured by livestock and a hard wood which makes excellent charcoal. Finally, it helps to retain soil moisture thanks to its well developed root system and, as with all leguminous plants, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen and thereby increases soil fertility. The orchards of gum acacia in the Sudan now provide most of the world's gum, which is used primarily in the drug and confectionery industry. In Kordofan, the trees are harvested from seven to 12 years before being pruned. During the four or five years that it takes for them to return to production, food crops are interplanted between the trees. In West Africa, production has become very limited despite the high prices paid (1000 CFA per kg for the harvesters). In Mauritania, production plummeted from 6000 - 8000 t per year in 1972 to 150 t in 1986. And this despite the fact that demand greatly exceeds supply on the international market. To respond to this situation, numerous projects have recently been started. The regeneration of old gum plantations has already begun in Senegal, Mauritania, Mali and Niger. Experiments are also being conducted with village plantations using unproven varieties that are both more productive and more resistant to drought. These plantations, however, require careful maintenance, especially during the first few years. The young trees must be protected from animals by wire fences or thorn hedges and watered during a year or two to ensure their establishment. Finally work is needed on ways of improving the traditional tapping methods which often kill the tree by removing two or three metres of bark with one swipe of a machete. Training must, of course, be an integral part of such programmes. By returning the gum acacia to its former glory, one would also reduce the stress on the Sahelian ecosystem and favourize a cash crop that has little competition on the international market. Other plants that have long been part of the African landscape and its local economies can, if favourized play a significant role in the development of such areas. The often forgotten <b>shea</b> <b>butter</b> <b>tree</b> for example, is the third export crop of Senegal but it receives virtually no research attention. This despite the fact that its nuts have always been collected by women and transformed into butter. This is the same product that eventually reaches the cosmetic counters of European stores where it is bought by people with delicate skin! The list of these trees and other plants that are poorly known by researchers and development workers is very long: the neem tree with its insecticidal powers; Acacia albida which helps to regenerate soils; the kenaf which can be used for paper production and the many other trees that provide highly appreciated food products. The list of potential uses is also very long. From domestic facilities up to export products, the diverse potential of these numerous local plants merits much more attention. This opportunity is actually more valuable in the short term than the development of exotic species brought in from other countries, if not continents. While the latter may have some remarkable points in their favour, their ecological and social integration often poses many difficult problems that soon cause their miraculous reputations to be forgotten.
