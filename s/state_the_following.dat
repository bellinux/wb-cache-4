5|$|After Lincoln's death, Hay {{spent several}} years at {{diplomatic}} posts in Europe, then worked for the New-York Tribune under Horace Greeley and Whitelaw Reid. Yet, Hay remained active in politics, and from 1879 to 1881 served as Assistant Secretary of State. Afterward, he remained in the private sector, until President McKinley, for whom {{he had been a}} major backer, made him Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1897.

Maryland would rise in the polls, and enter the Harris and BCS rankings after beating NC <b>State</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> week. However, after the loss to Virginia Tech, the Terps fell out of the rankings altogether. Maryland made one final poll appearance after the win over North Carolina, before losing to Florida State.|$|E

5|$|With an 80 {{record and}} a No. 5 {{national}} ranking, Clemson hosted Georgia Tech. In the game, the Yellow Jackets posted a school-record offensive effort in an upset victory over the Tigers. Clemson took a 2824 lead with 1:52 remaining in the game, but the Yellow Jackets drove 80 yards in 11 plays before ending with a one-handed catch for a touchdown, giving Clemson its first loss of the season. The defeat eliminated the Tigers from national championship contention, but they still {{had a chance to}} win the conference championship if they defeated Florida <b>State</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> week.|$|E
5|$|Organised prehistoric {{cultures}} began developing {{on current}} Bulgarian lands during the Neolithic period. Its ancient history saw {{the presence of}} the Thracians, Greeks, Persians, Celts, Romans, Goths, Alans and Huns. The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 AD, which dominated most of the Balkans and functioned as a cultural hub for Slavs during the Middle Ages. With the downfall of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1396, its territories came under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 {{led to the formation of}} the Third Bulgarian <b>State.</b> <b>The</b> <b>following</b> years saw several conflicts with its neighbours, which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 it became a one-party socialist state as part of the Soviet-led Eastern Bloc. In December 1989 the ruling Communist Party allowed multi-party elections, which subsequently led to Bulgaria's transition into a democracy and a market-based economy.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the start}} of the second quarter, Appalachian State ran another six plays, ending the drive with a nine-yard {{touchdown}} pass by Edwards to Hans Batichon. The extra point again evened the score, this time at 14–14. Michigan was forced into a three-and-out and had to punt the ball, with Appalachian State starting their next drive at the Michigan 37. On the fifth play of the next drive, the Mountaineers scored a touchdown on a 20-yard pass from Edwards to Jackson. The Mountaineers converted the extra point attempt, giving them the lead at 21–14. Michigan began their next drive at their 20-yard line, and drove down to the Appalachian State 40-yard line in four plays. Their next play, a Brandon Minor run for five yards, was followed by a Minor run for no yards and an incomplete pass. The Wolverines opted to go for it on fourth down but failed to convert, turning the ball over to Appalachian <b>State.</b> <b>The</b> <b>following</b> Mountaineer drive featured nine running plays in a row, the last a six-yard run by Edwards for a touchdown. The extra point was successful, increasing the Mountaineer lead and making the score 28–14. Michigan returned the next kickoff to their 32-yard line, with 2:15 left on the clock. The Wolverines drove to the Appalachian five-yard line, ultimately settling for a field goal with 23seconds left, cutting Appalachian State's lead to eleven points.|$|E

But, they transferred this {{title to the}} <b>State</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> year, including the fountain, the surrounding lands and access along Rua do Raio: the Direcção Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGMEN) then demolitioned the public tank, water pipes, encountered an imbrex and tegula and votive inscription. Subsequent repairs occurred in 1952, while access to the space was developed in 1967.|$|E
25|$|Two {{language}} {{groups have}} coexisted on the Scandinavian peninsula since prehistory—the North Germanic languages (Scandinavian languages) and the Sami languages. Due to later migrations, Finnish, Yiddish and Romani {{have also been}} spoken for over a hundred years. Denmark also has a minority of German-speakers. More recent migrations has added even more languages. Apart from Sami and the languages of minority groups speaking {{a variant of the}} majority language of a neighboring <b>state,</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> minority languages in Scandinavia are protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages: Yiddish, Romani Chib, Romanes and Romani.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in the state, NTR {{recommended}} {{dissolution of}} the Assembly and called for fresh elections the following year in the <b>state</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> year to ensure the people had a fresh choice to elect their representatives.

25|$|McCracken's first IU {{team was}} led by All-America Ernie Andres, later a McCracken {{basketball}} assistant. In McCracken's first year, the team finished 17–3, splitting games with both Purdue and eventual NCAA runnerup Ohio <b>State.</b> <b>The</b> <b>following</b> year the 1939–40 NCAA title team, led by All-American Marvin Huffman, would take Indiana to unprecedented success: an NCAA title and a record (at the time) 20 wins. The 20–3 record by that team would not be bested for another 13 years until broken again by Indiana. At their home court at The Fieldhouse, Indiana saw six perfect seasons including a 24-game unbeaten home winning streak from 1938–1941. In 1948, McCracken was responsible for recruiting Bill Garrett who became the first African American player in Big Ten varsity basketball history.|$|E
25|$|The {{air force}} withdrew entirely form {{the airport in}} 1959, which spurred discussions between the {{involved}} parties regarding the ownership of the airport. A settlement was reached in 1960, where the municipalities of Sem and Tønsberg bought the airport for NOK1 million from the <b>state.</b> <b>The</b> <b>following</b> year they sold it for NOK850,000 to Thor Solberg Aviation, {{on the condition that}} the company continue to operate the airport. The first Norwegian championship in radio-controlled aircraft was held at Jarlsberg in 1962. Thor Solberg retained operations at the airport until 1967. The company then attempted to sell the airport, first to Øyvind Skauenfeldt in 1969, then to Sem and Tønsberg Municipalities in 1970 and then to Skauenfeldt again in 1972, but neither were interested in paying the quoted price.|$|E
25|$|The typical way to {{consider}} polarization {{is to keep}} track of the orientation of the electric field vector as the electromagnetic wave propagates. The electric field vector of a plane wave may be arbitrarily divided into two perpendicular components labeled x and y (with z indicating the direction of travel). The shape traced out in the x-y plane by the electric field vector is a Lissajous figure that describes the polarization <b>state.</b> <b>The</b> <b>following</b> figures show some examples of the evolution of the electric field vector (blue), with time (the vertical axes), at a particular point in space, along with its x and y components (red/left and green/right), and the path traced by the vector in the plane (purple): The same evolution would occur when looking at the electric field at a particular time while evolving the point in space, along the direction opposite to propagation.|$|E

25|$|After some {{prevarication}} {{and after}} Winston Churchill had actually ordered British troops to assault the rebels, Collins decided {{he had to}} act and borrowed British artillery to shell {{the republicans in the}} Four Courts. They surrendered after a two-day (28–30 June 1922) artillery bombardment by Free State troops but some of their IRA comrades occupied O'Connell Street, which saw street fighting for another week before the Free State army secured the capital. (See Battle of Dublin). Over 60 combatants were killed in the fighting, including senior republican Cathal Brugha. About 250 civilians are also thought to have been killed or injured, but the total has never been accurately counted. Oscar Traynor conducted some guerrilla operations south of the city until his capture in late July 1922. Ernie O'Malley, the republican commander for the province of Leinster was captured after a shootout in the Ballsbridge area in November 1922. On 6 December 1922, the IRA assassinated Sean Hales a member of Parliament as he was leaving Leinster House in Dublin city centre, in reprisal for the executions of their prisoners by the Free <b>State.</b> <b>The</b> <b>following</b> day, the four leaders of the republicans in the Four Courts (Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Dick Barret and Joe McKelvey) were executed in revenge. Dublin was relatively quiet thereafter, although guerrilla war raged in the provinces. The new Free State government eventually suppressed this insurrection by mid-1923. In April, Frank Aiken, IRA chief of staff, ordered the anti-treaty forces to dump their arms and go home. The civil war left a permanent strain of bitterness in Irish politics that did much to sour the achievement of national independence.|$|E
500|$|In the Kingdom of Hawaii, Bayard and Cleveland {{pursued a}} similar goal of {{maintaining}} the Hawaiian kingdom's independence while expanding access for American trade. [...] As a Senator, Bayard had voted for free trade with Hawaii, but the treaty was allowed to lapse in 1884. [...] As Secretary of <b>State</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> year, Bayard hoped to again have free trade with Hawaii, and also endorsed the idea of establishing an American naval base there, although he preferred Midway Atoll to the eventual location, Pearl Harbor. [...] A treaty to that effect passed the Senate in 1887 by a 43–11 vote. [...] As in Samoa, the administration sought to curb foreign influence, encouraging the Hawaiian government to reject a loan from Britain that would have required pledging future government revenues toward its repayment.|$|E
500|$|Maryland {{athletics}} {{in general}} were marred {{by the death}} of Len Bias, and the football team was no exception. After Ross resigned, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Joe Krivak was promoted to head coach. This {{was the beginning of a}} lackluster period for Terrapins football. [...] From 1987 to 2000, the Terrapins went 55–88 overall (.385) with only two winning seasons and one bowl appearance. The Krivak era was met with a brutal schedule with non-conference opponents consisting of national powers Michigan, Miami, Penn State, and Syracuse among others. [...] After a 4–7 season in 1987, a controversial loss to [...] in the final game of 1988 cost the team a sixth win for bowl eligibility. In 1989, Maryland tied Joe Paterno's 13th-ranked Penn <b>State.</b> <b>The</b> <b>following</b> season, the Terrapins beat 25th-ranked West Virginia and upset 8th-ranked Virginia. Maryland received a bid to the [...] and tied Louisiana Tech in what would be their only postseason appearance during this period. Athletic director Andy Geiger rewarded Krivak with a five-year contract extension, [...] but the 1991 season unraveled after a rash of injuries, and Maryland had its worst finish in two decades with a 2–9 mark. After public criticism from several players, Krivak felt he lost credibility as the head coach and resigned on December 6.|$|E
