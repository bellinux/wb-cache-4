500|$|To all the praise, Youngblood responded, [...] "I don't {{consider}} myself tough, I {{consider myself}} a nut for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> did". Youngblood concluded, [...] "I wasn’t the biggest guy, I certainly wasn’t the strongest and I wasn’t the fastest either. [...] But I think one of my biggest assets was that I had an undeniable determination {{to be the best}} that has ever {{put his hand on the}} ground, I had a genuine desire to be great." ...|$|E
500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "Pretty as a Swastika", a [...] "mosh pit-ready" [...] heavy metal song. Manson described {{it as one of}} his proudest moments lyrically. According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. I mean, it was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so I felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on the day we broke up. Maybe <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> say in the song are cruel, but it is how I felt at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Time Machine Is My New Girlfriend" [...] is a frenetic rocker with a Bo Diddley rhythm, {{and lyrics}} cautioning {{listeners}} that relationships can come with [...] "late fees". Hunt explained its lyrics to be {{a metaphor for}} his lover making him feel younger. The title track features metronomic drumming and chicken scratch riffs. It is about people from different economic classes falling in love after social and economic conditions moved them into the same neighborhood. The setting is described in the first verse, [...] "It's the end of white flight / even tycoons are licking their wounds / economic blight got the neighborhood looking gap-toothed / end of white flight / maybe now you see something you like / money tight and you're hating your life". Hunt said that writing the song was [...] "essentially a response to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> have seen {{as a result of}} the global recession we are going through. I wasn't trying to make any political statement. I was more making a philosophical comment that essentially says we have all these unspoken issues in our society. But I see a collision of those ideas and unresolved issues. My question is what could you have been hoping for when we make the kind of decisions in our society that we have made." ...|$|E

2500|$|Their {{experiences}} at the Reading and Leeds festivals was very negative: the band got bottled by the angry crowd. These experiences, plus poor critical reviews and reception from other bands, made the group [...] "bitter and cynical."

2500|$|Oshii noted his {{attention}} to detail might be particularly Japanese: [...] "I get absorbed in the finer points [...] like what {{the back of a}} bottle label looks like when you see it through the glass [...] That's very Japanese, I suppose. I want people {{to go back to the}} film again and again to pick up things they missed the first time." [...] Describing the overall look, the director said, [...] "The film is set in the future, but it's looking at present-day society. And as I said, there's an autobiographical element as well. I'm looking back at <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> liked as a child — the 1950s cars and so on. Basically, I wanted to create a different world — not a future world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Banville {{was educated}} at CBS Primary, Wexford, a Christian Brothers school, and at St Peter's College, Wexford. Despite having {{intended}} to be a painter and an architect, he did not attend university. Banville has described this as [...] "A great mistake. I should have gone. I regret not taking that four years of getting drunk and falling in love. But I wanted to get away from my family. I wanted to be free." [...] Alternately he has stated that college would have had little benefit for him: [...] "I don't think I would have learned much more, and I don't think I would have had the nerve to tackle <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> tackled as a young writer if I had been to university — I would have been beaten into submission by my lecturers." [...] After school he worked as a clerk at Aer Lingus, which allowed him to travel at deeply discounted rates. He took advantage of this to travel in Greece and Italy. He lived in the United States during 1968 and 1969. On his return to Ireland, he became a sub-editor at The Irish Press, rising eventually to the position of chief sub-editor.|$|E

Ringer said of his role, [...] "My {{goal is to make}} sure I keep {{producing}} each chance I get and try to make sure I am being productive, And just continue to do what I can to get better." [...] Titans head coach Jeff Fisher said of Ringer [...] "He's got great run skills and he's in good shape, He's got a sense and a knack for pushing the ball north and south. Again we just finished the first day in pads, and he's probably had 10 reps, so we still have some time." [...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different things that they do is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how they go about their business. ... I am asking questions and they've been very helpful with me." [...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you have the talent to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ...

60|$|A third point, {{perhaps not}} quite so certain as our {{previous}} two, is that the truth of memory cannot be wholly practical, as pragmatists wish all truth to be.
