5|$|In 1438, {{another of}} John Manners' sons, Robert, {{inherited}} the castle and the estates. The lands {{had fallen in}} value considerably over the preceding years, {{as a result of}} the wars with the Scots, the feuding with the Herons and the poverty of the lands. Robert's son, another Robert Manners, inherited the property in 1464, and passed the castle onto his son, George, on his death in 1495. George inherited the title of Baron de Ros from his mother's <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> and the castle was abandoned as a residence by the family around the end of the 15th century when the Manners moved closer to the royal court.|$|E
5|$|John Roberts Tunis {{was born}} December 7, 1889 to John Arthur and Caroline Greene Roberts Tunis, a teacher, in Boston, Massachusetts.

His family disowned him when he married Caroline, the {{daughter}} of a waiter. When Tunis was seven and his brother Robert five their father died of Bright's disease; no one from the Tunis <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> attended the funeral.

5|$|The Grey dynasty {{maintained}} their {{ownership of the}} castle, which passed into Lady Mary Grey's <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> following a law case in 1704. The lands around the castle and the outer bailey were used for growing wheat, barley and oats, and the walls were robbed of their stone for other building work. A small settlement, called Nova Scotia or Novia Scotia, {{was built on the}} site of the castle's harbour, possibly by Scottish immigrants. Several engravings were published of the castle in the 18th century, including a somewhat inaccurate depiction by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck in 1720, and by Francis Grose and William Hutchinson in 1773 and 1776 respectively.|$|E

5|$|Although {{women were}} on a lower social tier than men (according to Confucian ethics), they enjoyed many social and legal {{privileges}} and wielded considerable power {{at home and in}} their own small businesses. As Song society became more and more prosperous and parents on the bride's <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> provided larger dowries for her marriage, women naturally gained many new legal rights in ownership of property. Under certain circumstances, an unmarried daughter without brothers, or a surviving mother without sons, could inherit one-half of her father's share of undivided family property. There were many notable and well-educated women, and it was a common practice for women to educate their sons during their earliest youth. The mother of the scientist, general, diplomat, and statesman Shen Kuo taught him essentials of military strategy. There were also exceptional women writers and poets, such as Li Qingzhao (1084–1151), who became famous even in her lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Marian Cruger Coffin (September 16, 1876 – February 2, 1957) {{was one of}} {{the first}} American women to work as a {{professional}} landscape architect, and became famous for designing numerous gardens for members of the East Coast elite to whom she had connections through her mother's <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b> As a child, she received almost no formal education but was home-tutored while living with her mother's relatives in upstate New York. Coffin was determined to embark on a career despite the social problems that it would cause for a woman of her class and enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she studied between 1901–4 as one of only four women in architecture and landscape design.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{belonged to}} a {{sporting}} family; his grandfather Michael Nash and great-uncle Thomas Nash were leading players for Carlton Football Club in the 1880s, his father Robert captained Collingwood Football Club and coached Footscray Football Club, and played cricket, opening the bowling for Hamilton in a match against the 1920–1921 touring English side, while Robert Junior also became a leading footballer in Tasmania and country Victoria. Nash's mother was an orphan who was probably adopted several times, allowing historians no opportunity to determine any sporting links on her <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b> Nash's biographer also claims that former Prime Minister of New Zealand Sir Walter Nash and pianist Eileen Joyce {{were related to the}} family.|$|E
50|$|Born in Clooney House to {{a wealthy}} land-owning family, Bindon was well {{positioned}} to establish contacts that would ultimately benefit his career.

5|$|The {{son of a}} builder, O'Neill {{was born}} in Carlton, New South Wales. He had no cricketing {{associations}} on his father's <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> but his maternal uncle, Ron Campion, played for the Glebe club in Sydney Grade Cricket. Campion trained for cricket near the O'Neill family home, at Bexley Oval. O'Neill accompanied his uncle to cricket {{from the age of}} seven and was given batting practice {{at the end of each}} session. At Bexley Primary school, O'Neill was denied a chance to play cricket as the school did not field a team. Moving on to Kogarah Intermediate High School, O'Neill played cricket in defiance of a teacher who recommended that he take up athletics. As a teenager, O'Neill idolised Keith Miller after his uncle took him to the Sydney Cricket Ground: O'Neill saw Miller play that day and was impressed with the way he hit the ball off the back foot.|$|E
5|$|Another wealthy family, the Eccles, {{commissioned}} Arrington {{to write}} a biography of David Eccles, a millionaire who helped form the industrial economy in Utah. David Eccles was a polygamist, and the descendants of his two wives, Bertha Jensen in Ogden and Ellen Stoddard in Logan, did not agree about how the biography should be written. Nora Harrison from the Logan {{part of the family}} originally commissioned the biography, but did not own enough material for the necessary research. Cleone Eccles, David's daughter-in-law from the Ogden <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> wanted a biography that focused on only positive things about David Eccles, while Harrison wanted a professional, scholarly work. In order to access Cleone Eccles's collection of David Eccles's manuscripts, Harrison agreed to give Cleone the right to make alterations to the text. Arrington employed JoAnn Bair to do the research and first drafts of the work. Harrison was unhappy with the manuscript and paid their neighbor and writer Wallace Stegner to critique the manuscript; his 15-page guidelines advised the writer to engage the reader through cliffhangers, flashbacks, and speculation. Stegner also found the manuscript too gentle on David Eccles's fraudulent business dealings. To appease Harrison, Arrington had Maureen Ursenbach Beecher improve the manuscript's literary style, but the final biography still lacked real criticism of Eccles's business practices.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether including traditional healing methods within mental health services is desirable among users of these services in Sámi areas of northern Norway. Study design. A cross-sectional questionnaire based survey among users <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mental health services in Finnmark and Nord-Troms Norway. Methods. <b>The</b> percentages <b>of</b> participants desiring traditonal healing modalities within the health services were calculated, and univariate and multivariate anslysis were performed with respect to factors associated with a desire for integration. Results. A total of 186 users responded to <b>the</b> survey, <b>of</b> which 72 reported some degree of Sámi cultural affiliation. Forty-eight had Sámi-speaking grandparents on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b> <b>The</b> desire for <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> traditional healing was high among all with a Sámi cultural back-ground. Eighty-one percent of those with Sámi speaking grandparents on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> desired such an integration. In a regression analysis, both Sámi affiliation and having used tradi-tional healing forms were significantly associated with a desire for <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> traditional healing within mental health services. Conclusions. <b>The</b> integration <b>of</b> traditional healing methods within health services has been suggested both by the World Health Organization and is used in some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> services to Indig-enous populations in Western countries. This study shows that such integration is desirable among Sámi users of mental health services in Norway...|$|R

500|$|Throughout {{their school}} years the {{brothers}} {{were sent to}} stay during the holidays with various uncles and aunts from both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b> In <b>the</b> Oxford Dictionary <b>of</b> National Biography, Iain Sproat counts twenty aunts and considers that they played an important part not only in Wodehouse's early life, but, thinly disguised, in his mature novels, as the formidable aunts who dominate the action in the Wooster, Blandings, and other stories. The boys had fifteen uncles, four of whom were clergymen. Sproat writes that they inspired Wodehouse's [...] "pious but fallible curates, vicars, and bishops, of which he wrote with friendly irreverence but without mockery".|$|R
