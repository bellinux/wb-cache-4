50|$|Hook and Loop jumping is a {{game where}} people wearing hook-covered suits take a running jump and hurl {{themselves}} as high as possible at a loop-covered wall. The wall is inflated, and looks similar to other inflatable structures. It is not necessarily completely covered in the material—often there will be vertical <b>strips</b> of <b>hooks.</b> Sometimes, instead of a running jump, people use a small trampoline.|$|R
50|$|A Velcro hair roller {{is made of}} a <b>strip</b> of <b>hook</b> and loop {{fasteners}} that {{is wrapped}} around cylinders. They are available in different sizes {{and can be used}} on dry or wet hair. The rollers are self-holding because they do not need pins or clips to be held in place. But they are not considered sanitary and are not permitted by the state board in some states.|$|R

50|$|The Protective Motif, Cassidy's {{first solo}} show in New York, debuted in 2010 at Invisible-Exports gallery in Manhattan's Lower East Side. The show {{included}} The Paper Photographs (2008), ink drawings, {{and the wall}} based sculptures, Nail Bomb (2009) and Through (2010). Cassidy works in cut brass, weaving, <b>stripping,</b> and <b>hooking</b> abstract patterns and textures on a wood frames. These works are minimalist in material but maximalist in emotion, and operate where autobiography meets methodology.|$|R
50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{bundling}} cable together securely and semi-permanently include cable lacing, binding knots {{such as the}} surgeon's knot or constrictor knot, Velcro brand hook-and-loop <b>strips,</b> conveyor belt <b>hooks,</b> twist ties, Rapstrap fasteners, metal buckle clips or Cablox cable management.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fastener}} {{consisted of}} two components: a lineal fabric <b>strip</b> with tiny <b>hooks</b> that could [...] "mate" [...] with another fabric strip with smaller loops, attaching temporarily, until pulled apart. Initially made of cotton, which proved impractical, the fastener was eventually constructed with nylon and polyester.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAnr-core of a Young diagramλis a {{residual}} subdiagram obtained after consecutive removals of the feasibler-long border <b>strips,</b> “rim <b>hooks.</b> ” The removal process on the diagramλand the resultingr-core are {{the essential elements}} in the Murnaghan–Nakayama formula forχλ, {{the character of the}} associated irreducible representation ofSn(n=|λ|), on the conjugacy class {r[n/r]} (n≡ 0 modr). A complete characterization ofr-cores is given, which extends a well known result forr= 2. Under an assumption that the partitionλis chosen uniformly at random out of all partitions ofn, it is shown that typically ther-core size is of ordern 1 / 2, while the height and the width are of ordern 1 / 4. Fornchosen uniformly at random between 1 andN, the core boundary scaled byN 1 / 4 is proved to converge, in distribution, to a random concave curve which consists ofr− 1 line segments...|$|R
50|$|As primary {{component}} of the IIFS the tactical load carrying vest (Vest, Tactical Load Carrying 8415-01-317-1622) is constructed of a seven-ounce nylon fabric printed in the Woodland camouflage pattern and weighs 1.8 pounds empty. The tactical load carrying vest {{is compatible with the}} standard individual equipment belt. The individual equipment belt is secured to the tactical load-carrying vest with 10 belt loops that use both hook and pile fasteners and snaps. The tactical load carrying vest has four permanently attached ammunition pockets that can carry six 30-round cartridge magazines for the M16 assault rifle. The pocket covers are secured by one snap and a <b>strip</b> of <b>hook</b> and pile. A pull tab is used to open the pocket. Located directly below the ammunition pockets are two pockets, designed to hold the M67 fragmentation grenade. The shoulders are protected by 1/2 inch 1.27 cm foam padding. The tactical load carrying vest closes in front with two chest straps using plastic quick release buckles. Two 2 inch 5.71 cm webbing and two D-Rings sewn {{to the back of the}} tactical load carrying vest can be used as equipment attachment points.|$|R
6000|$|In {{front of}} the {{lighthouse}} there had been built a little plank dock, running out twenty yards or so. The water was about six feet deep, and a channel of varying width meandered between the coral reefs out to the deep blue sea. This {{must have been a}} lane for big fish to come inside the barrier. Almost always there were great shadows drifting around in the water. First I tried artificial baits. Some one, hoping to convert me, had given me a whole box of those ugly, murderous plug-baits made famous by Robert H. Davis. Whenever I made a cast with one of these a big fish would hit it and either <b>strip</b> the <b>hooks</b> off or break my tackle. Some of these fish leaped clear. They looked like barracuda to me, only they were almost as silvery as a tarpon. One looked ten feet long and as big around as a telegraph pole. When this one smashed the water white and leaped, Manuel yelled, [...] "Pecuda!" [...] I tried hard to catch a specimen, and had a good many hooked, but they always broke away. I did not know then, as I know now, that barracuda grow to twelve feet in the Caribbean. That fact is mentioned in records and natural histories.|$|R
5000|$|After {{retiring}} from baseball, {{and during the}} offseason during his years in baseball, Bassler {{spent much of his}} time hooking rugs. Bassler would take old silk stockings and dye them in pots on the stove. He would then cut them in <b>strips</b> and <b>hook</b> them into silk rugs. In the 1940s, Bassler bought 48 acre in Latigo Canyon in Malibu for $75 an acre; he drove to the property on weekends and planted plants. He also built a house on the property, using discarded tile from a Malibu tile company and wood from the demolition of the Venice Pier. Bassler also collected materials from his job at the Twentieth Century Fox movie lot in Century City. According to his son, the studio job was [...] "mainly to get building supplies." [...] After a project, the sets would be torn down and burned. Bassler saw an opportunity to obtain materials from discarded sets to help build his house in Latigo Canyon. Bassler's son joked that their house went up bit by bit with pieces from Hollywood sets, including the front door from a Gene Tierney film Leave Her to Heaven, and {{the back of the house}} (in Chinese style) from Gregory Peck's The Keys of the Kingdom.|$|R
5000|$|He {{attended}} Saint Ann's School, {{a private}} school in Brooklyn and in his sophomore year interned with fashion designer Nicole Miller. As a teen, he also won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award. At age 16 he enrolled in the pre-college program at Parsons The New School for Design. He graduated from Saint Ann's in 1999. For three years, Posen was mentored by curator Richard Martin at The Costume Institute of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. At age 18, he was accepted into the womenswear degree program at London's Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design at the University of the Arts London. In 2001, Posen constructed a gown entirely made from thin leather <b>strips</b> and dressmaker <b>hooks</b> and eyes that was displayed by the Victoria and Albert Museum and featured in their [...] "Curvaceous" [...] exhibition.|$|R
500|$|The band added [...] "Lost in Paradise" [...] to the {{set list}} of the Evanescence Tour. While {{reviewing}} a performance of the song, Rick Florino of Artistdirect said, [...] "Speaking of vocal prowess, Lee reached the level of legends during 'Lost In Paradise'. Sitting at a piano center stage, she entranced with a shimmering melody and heartbreaking, hypnotic <b>hook.</b> <b>Stripped</b> of any pomp and circumstance, Lee's talents transfixed. As the song built, the band entered rounding out the timeless ballad with a distinct heaviness." [...] Serene Dominic of The Arizona Republic wrote: [...] "The biggest shrieks came when the piano movers made their first appearance and wheeled a baby grand onstage for 'Lost in Paradise.'" [...] Joel Francis of The Kansas City Star described {{the performance of the}} song as [...] "spellbinding". Along with [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] (2003), the song was played in the band's concert with a live orchestra for the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway on December 11, 2011.|$|R
50|$|Hook Jaw {{was created}} by Mills as a Jaws cash-in and the {{flagship}} title of the comic. The strip was scripted by Ken Armstrong and drawn by Ramon Sola. Hook Jaw is a Great White Shark and {{the hero of the}} series, even though he {{spends most of his time}} eating most of the human cast of characters. The name Hook Jaw comes from the gaff hook stuck in the shark's jaw after some fisherman tried to catch the creature shortly before being eaten by it. Mills gave the strip an environmental edge by having Hook Jaw eat corrupt humans, or criminals, seeking to exploit the seas, as well as anyone else unlucky enough to get near him. Hook Jaw appeared in three stories before the ban. The first was set on an oil rig, the second was set on an island resort in the Caribbean, and the third was set just off the south coast of England. Hook Jaw returned after the ban, but no longer ate as many people and if he did it was off panel. The strip also lost the environmental themes Mills had placed in it. Spitfire Comics in 2007 released a collection of the pre-ban <b>strips</b> in Collected <b>Hook</b> Jaw vol.1.|$|R
