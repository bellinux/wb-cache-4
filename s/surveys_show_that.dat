5|$|Deep sky <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> {{galaxies are}} {{often found in}} groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|This {{model has}} Siletzia forming on the {{continental}} margin along {{what is now}} the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL; a zone of topographical features of unknown age and tectonic significance), with the southern end of Siletzia and the Klamath Mountains (joined to Siletzia) near the Idaho Batholith in central Idaho. Further evidence for this comes from the sand of the Tyee Formation that overlie the Roseburg Formation. Not only does this sand have the same isotopic composition of rock in the Idaho Batholith (and of sand now coursing down the Snake and Columbia Rivers), but it appears to have not been transported very far from its source. This implies that the Tyee Formation was much closer to the Idaho Batholith when it was deposited, and subsequently rotated away. Geodetic <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the region continues to rotate, likely as a result of extension of the Basin and Range Province and asthenospheric flow around the southern edge of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate.|$|E

25|$|The Baltic Sea {{somewhat}} {{resembles a}} riverbed, with two tributaries, the Gulf of Finland and Gulf of Bothnia. Geological <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> before the Pleistocene, {{instead of the}} Baltic Sea, there was a wide plain around a great river paleontologists call the Eridanos. Several Pleistocene glacial episodes scooped out the river bed into the sea basin. By {{the time of the}} last, or Eemian Stage (MIS5e), the Eemian Sea was in place. Instead of a true sea, the Baltic can even today also be understood as the common estuary of all rivers flowing into it.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} Chinese-language literature found numerous acupuncture-related adverse events, including pneumothorax, fainting, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and infection as the most frequent, and cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pneumothorax, and recurrent cerebral hemorrhage as the most serious, {{most of which were}} due to improper technique. Between 1980 and 2009, the Chinese-language literature reported 479 adverse events. Prospective <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> mild, transient acupuncture-associated adverse events ranged from 6.71% to 15%. In a study with 190,924 patients, the prevalence of serious adverse events was roughly 0.024%. Another study showed a rate of adverse events requiring specific treatment of 2.2%, 4,963 incidences among 229,230 patients. Infections, mainly hepatitis, after acupuncture are reported often in English-language research, though are rarely reported in Chinese-language research, making it plausible that acupuncture-associated infections have been underreported in China. Infections were mostly caused by poor sterilization of acupuncture needles. Other adverse events included spinal epidural hematoma (in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine), chylothorax, injuries of abdominal organs and tissues, injuries in the neck region, injuries to the eyes, including orbital hemorrhage, traumatic cataract, injury of the oculomotor nerve and retinal puncture, hemorrhage to the cheeks and the hypoglottis, peripheral motor-nerve injuries and subsequent motor dysfunction, local allergic reactions to metal needles, stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage after acupuncture.|$|E
500|$|Seismicity in the south–central United States is {{moderately}} powerful. The {{energy from}} a mid-continent earthquake extends over {{as much as}} ten times area of a similarly sized earthquake in the western United States. A magnitude 4.0 earthquake west of the Rocky Mountains reaches up to [...] from its epicenter, while a magnitude 5.5 earthquake in the eastern US can be felt [...] from its epicenter. Science failed to explain the phenomena until 1978, when geologists discovered a massive fault line running {{from the middle of}} the continent to its eastern coast. More recent magnetic <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the structure is a 500-million year-old strike-slip fault, which starts under the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone and runs to the eastern coast. This corresponds to the strike-slip faulting exhibited in the Eastern Tennessee Zone, and explains the presence of mid-continent earthquakes in the United States. Still, it is not clear if the fault is definitely related to mid-continental seismicity.|$|E

However, the number of Romanians saying that they would not want a homosexual neighbour has decreased from 86% in 2001 to 61% in 2007. Homosexuality [...] remains a social and political issue.

2500|$|Mercia's exact {{evolution}} at {{the start}} of the Anglo-Saxon era remains more obscure than that of Northumbria, Kent, or even Wessex. Mercia developed an effective political structure and adopted Christianity later than the other kingdoms. Archaeological <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> Angles settled the lands north of the River Thames by the 6th century. The name [...] "Mercia" [...] is Old English for [...] "boundary folk" [...] (see Welsh Marches), and the traditional interpretation is that the kingdom originated along the frontier between the native Welsh and the Anglo-Saxon invaders. However, P. Hunter Blair argued an alternative interpretation: that they emerged along the frontier between Northumbria and the inhabitants of the Trent river valley.|$|E

2500|$|The edifice has {{a square}} plan, with a [...] northeast–southwest orientation. The Byzantine edifice was also roughly square in plan, {{with a single}} nave preceded by an atrium at NE and a {{projecting}} room on the east side. Due to its small dimensions, the building can hardly be identified as a church, but rather as an annex belonging to a monastery. The analysis of the brickwork during the restoration showed different construction phases, and revealed that the foundations and the surviving walls were made of brick and stone. [...] Moreover, the <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> during the conversion into a mosque in 1506 the atrium and {{the wall of the}} Mihrab had to be rebuilt. At the same time, a massive minaret was erected on the northeast side of the building.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States modern roundabouts {{emerged in}} the 1990s. Municipalities {{introducing}} new roundabouts often are met {{with some degree of}} public resistance, just as in the United Kingdom in the 1960s. <b>Surveys</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> negative public opinion reverses as drivers gain experience with roundabouts. American confusion at how to enter and especially how to exit a roundabout was the subject of mockery such as featured in the film European Vacation and the television series The Simpsons. By 2011, however, some 3,000 roundabouts had been established, with that number growing steadily. A 1998 survey of municipalities found public opinion 68% opposed prior to construction; changing thereafter to 73% in favour. A 2007 survey found public support ranging from 22% to 44% prior to construction, and several years after construction was 57% to 87%. The first modern roundabout in the United States was constructed in Summerlin, Nevada in 1990. This roundabout occasioned dismay from residents, and a local news program said about it, [...] "Even police agree, [...] can be confusing at times." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moroccan women {{represent}} the most economically insecure social {{group in the}} country. One of six Moroccan households are lone-mother households, which {{represent the}} most impoverished households in the country. Women are categorized to have {{the highest levels of}} socio-economic and legal constraints, which exclude them from obtaining their basic needs. Although recent <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> women actively help in providing for their families economically, Moroccan legal texts discourage women's participation in economic productivity. Article 114 of the Moroccan Family Law states, [...] "every human being is responsible for providing for his needs by his own powers except the wife whose needs will be taken care of by her husband." [...] The patriarchal social structure of Morocco puts women as being inferior to men in all aspects. Women are denied equal opportunities in education and employment before the law, as well as access to resources. As a result, the female population in Morocco suffers from deprivation of capabilities. Young girls are often excluded from educational opportunities due to limited financial resources within the household and the burden of household chores expected from them.|$|E

Polls in 2008 showed {{that the vast majority}} of Iranians want their country to develop nuclear energy, and 90% of Iranians believe it is important (including 81% very important) for Iran [...] "to have a full fuel cycle nuclear program." [...] Though Iranians are not Arab, Arab publics in six countries also believe that Iran has the right to its nuclear program and should not be pressured to stop that program. A poll in September 2010 by the International Peace Institute found that 71 percent of Iranians favored the development of nuclear weapons, a drastic hike over the previous polls by the same agency. [...] However, in July 2012, a poll on an Iranian state-run media outlet found that 2/3 Iranians support suspending uranium enrichment in return for a gradual easing of sanctions. Meir Javedanfar, an Iranian-born commentator with the Middle East Economic and Political Analysis Company, stated that while Iranians may want nuclear energy, they don't want it at the price the government is willing to pay.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Somers, {{president}} of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia in 2007 article has emphasized the influence of American private investments for Russian democracy, {{as well as the}} amount of local support for them: [...] "In a nutshell, the booming Russian economy is transforming that nation's outlook, standard of living and opportunities for its people in ways that were unimaginable only five years ago. More than 10 million Russian citizens have traveled abroad. Private enterprise is thriving. Russians are happier, healthier and more optimistic than ever in their lives. And, contrary to what you might hear, <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the Russian people are as pro-American, if not more so, than the populations of many a European country, and most hope for closer relations with the United States." [...] He also said: [...] "I would argue that the American business community has played a not insignificant role in fostering these developments. By their willingness to invest in Russia's future, American companies have become effective ambassadors for the United States and its values, while creating new jobs and benefiting the economies of both our countries. And the Putin government has been supportive of these efforts in ways that some might find surprising. Russian officials go to considerable lengths to be cooperative and accommodate the needs of American business, {{while at the same time}} revising their regulations to align them more closely with international standards." ...|$|E
