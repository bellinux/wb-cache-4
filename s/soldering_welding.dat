For glasses these procedures are only applicable with restrictions.

During a thermal treatment a dynamic force affects the parts to be joined. This force is transmitted to the joining parts through their rotation energy homogeneously and enables a joining of large surfaces without undesired pressure peaks. The monolithic joined body gets unstressed in a subsequent cooling regime. Significant advantages of this technology are the low-stress joining of glasses without filler materials and a combinability of different glasses...|$|E

Both, pumping and direct applications will benefit from the further improvement of the brightness and control of the output spectrum of HPDL. While edge emitting diodes are already established, a new generation of vertical emitting diode lasers (VCSELs) made significant progress and provides easy scalable output power in the kW range. Beneficial properties are simplified beam shaping, flexible control of the temporal and spatial emission, compact design and low current operation. Other characteristics like efficiency and brightness of VCSELs are still lagging behind the edge emitter performance. Examples of direct applications like surface treatment, <b>soldering,</b> <b>welding,</b> additive manufacturing, cutting and their requirements on the HPDL performance are presented.

In particular, mixed convection due to moving surfaces is very important in these applications. Mixed convection in a channel, as a result of buoyancy and motion of one of its walls has received little research attention and few guidelines are available for choosing the best performing channel configuration, particularly when radiative effects are significant. In this study a numerical investigation of the effect of radiation on mixed convection in air due to the interaction between a buoyancy flow and an unheated moving plate induced flow in a uniformly heated convergent vertical channel is carried out. The moving plate has a constant velocity and moves in the buoyancy force direction. The principal walls of the channel are heated at uniform heat flux. The numerical analysis is accomplished by means of the commercial code Fluent. The effects of the wall emissivity, the minimum channel spacing, the converging angle and the moving plate velocity are investigated and results in terms of air velocity and temperature fields inside the channel and wall temperature profiles, both of the moving and the heated plates, are given.

40|$|A {{new theory}} of fatigue crack growth in ductile solids has {{recently}} been proposed based on the total plastic energy dissipation per cycle ahead of the crack. This and previous energy-based approaches in the literature suggest that the total plastic dissipation per cycle can be closely correlated with fatigue crack growth rates under Mode I loading. The goal {{of the current study}} is to extend the dissipated energy approach to steady-state crack growth under mixed-mode loading conditions, with application to cyclic delamination of ductile interfaces in layered materials. The total plastic dissipation per cycle is obtained by 2 -D elastic-plastic finite element analysis of a stationary crack in a general mixed-mode specimen geometry under constant amplitude loading. Both elastic-perfectly plastic and bi-linear kinematic hardening constitutive behaviors are considered, and numerical results for a dimensionless plastic dissipation per cycle are presented over the full range of relevant mechanical properties and mixed-mode loading conditions. In addition, numerical results are presented for the case of fatigue crack growth along a bonded interface between materials with identical elastic, yet dissimilar plastic properties, including mismatches in both kinematic hardening modulus and yield strength. Finally, the approach is generalized to include mismatches in both elastic and plastic properties, and results for the dimensionless plastic dissipation per cycle are reported over the complete design space of bimaterial interfaces. The results of this thesis are of interest in <b>soldering,</b> <b>welding,</b> coating, electronic packaging, and a variety of layered manufacturing applications, where mismatches in both elastic and plastic properties can exist between the deposited material and the substrate...|$|E

40|$|A {{new theory}} of fatigue crack growth in ductile solids has {{recently}} been proposed based on the total plastic energy dissipation per cycle ahead of the crack. This, and previous energy-based approaches in the literature, suggest that the total plastic dissipation per cycle can be closely correlated with fatigue crack growth rates under mode I loading. The goal of the current research is to extend the dissipated energy approach to steady-state crack growth under mixed-mode I/II loading conditions, with application to cyclic delamination of ductile bimaterial interfaces. Such systems can occur in brazing, <b>soldering,</b> <b>welding,</b> {{and a variety of}} layered manufacturing applications, where high-temperature material deposition can result in a mismatch in mechanical properties between the deposited material and the substrate. The total plastic dissipation per cycle is obtained by 2 -D elastic-plastic finite element analysis of a stationary crack in a general mixed-mode specimen geometry under constant amplitude loading. Numerical results for a dimensionless plastic dissipation per cycle are presented over the full range of relevant material combinations and mixed-mode loading conditions. Results suggest that while applied mode-mix ratio is the dominant parameter, mismatches in yield strength and hardening modulus can {{have a significant effect on}} the total plastic dissipation per cycle, which is dominated by the weaker/softer material. Results extended to general elastic-plastic mismatches provide substantial insight into the effects of crack-tip constraint, material hardening behavior and applied mode-mix ratio on the dissipated energy during fatigue crack growth. A consistent definition of the mode mix ratio is presented based on minimizing the elastic strain energy at a crack tip. Next, application of the current theory is demonstrated for thermomechanical fatigue of bonded bimaterials. Finally, the plastic dissipation computations are erformed in a probabilistic framework in an attempt to assess the variability of the fatigue crack growth rate based on variation in bulk properties...|$|E

40|$|Metal objects have {{traditionally}} not been repaired or constructed by adhesives, but primarily by <b>soldering,</b> <b>welding,</b> and mechanical assemblies. Soldering has many disadvantages for the conservator such {{as lack of}} reversibility, problems to solder a corroded surface, corrosive flux, heating causing damage to the patina, crystal structure and more. Bonding of historical metal objects with adhesives is here examined. A literature survey is done. Another goal with the work is to get {{an indication of the}} suitability of various adhesives by means of simple test methods. Two test objects (candle holders) of tin, were chosen as basis for the investigation. Six adhesives were selected for testing: Paraloid B- 72, (a thermoplastic acrylic copolymer), two different epoxies, (Araldite 2011 A + B and Bostik Epoxy Rapid) an ethyl cyanoacrylate product, (Loctite Super Glue Precision), Bostik contact, a contact adhesive based on polychloroprene rubber, Dana limstänger, (a hot melt adhesive consisting of an EVA copolymer). These adhesives were subjected to simple tests, a pH test, a so-called Oddy test and a simple tensile test with specimens of tin to investigate strength. In addition, a test for removability of the adhesive and a very simple contact test were carried out. pH tests showed that many of the adhesives are quite acidic when wet. After curing the pH of the epoxies are about pH 9 - 10. The others were more neutral after curing. Oddy test showed that all but Paraloid B- 72 affected lead slightly. ”Epoxy Rapid” affected silver and copper with a dark colour. The results of strength tests were somewhat difficult to interpret. The strength differed greatly between the adhesives. For example the specimens bonded by the hot-melt adhesive fell apart by themselves. The cyanoacrylate was so strong that in one sample the joint was not broken at all, instead the tin specimen broke. When the tests were done the two candlesticks were treated. Only some indicating conjectures can be made by these results.
