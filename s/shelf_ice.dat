25|$|Winter: Winter months {{bring the}} risk of <b>shelf</b> <b>ice.</b> This is a {{condition}} where the winter winds push ice from Lake Michigan onto the beaches. As the cold depends, the ice can build up into long ridges creating an arctic dunescape. Much of this ice is floating. It may be dangerous {{to walk on the}} ice as there can be air pockets into which you can sink. Rescue is extremely difficult.|$|E
25|$|The Larsen D Ice Shelf {{is between}} Smith Peninsula {{in the south}} and Gipps Ice Rise. It is {{considered}} to be generally stable. Over roughly the past fifty years it has advanced (expanded) whereas comparable George VI, Bach, Stange, and Larsen C ice shelves have retreated (to a much greater net extent). The most recent survey of Larsen D measured it at 22,600 km2. There is fast ice along the entire front. This makes it difficult to interpret the ice front because the semi-permanent sea ice varies in thickness and may be nearly indistinguishable from <b>shelf</b> <b>ice.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{landscape}} of the peninsula is typical Antarctic tundra. The peninsula has a sharp elevation gradient, with glaciers flowing into the Larsen <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf,</b> which experienced significant breakup in 2002. Other <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> on the peninsula include George VI <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf,</b> Wilkins <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf,</b> Wordie <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf</b> and the Bach <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf.</b> The Filchner-Ronne <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf</b> lies {{to the east of}} the peninsula.|$|R
5|$|Antarctica is {{intensely}} {{cold and}} arid. Most of the world's freshwater ice is contained within its sheets. Its most dramatic example of glacier retreat {{is the loss}} of large sections of the Larsen <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf</b> on the Antarctic Peninsula. The recent collapse of Wordie <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf,</b> Prince Gustav <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf,</b> Mueller <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf,</b> Jones <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf,</b> Larsen-A and Larsen-B <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf</b> on the Antarctic Peninsula has raised awareness of how dynamic <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> systems are.|$|R
500|$|The {{emperor penguin}} has a {{circumpolar}} {{distribution in the}} Antarctic almost exclusively between the 66° and 77° south latitudes. It almost always breeds on stable pack ice near the coast and up to [...] offshore. Breeding colonies are usually located in areas where ice cliffs and icebergs shelter them from the wind. Three land colonies have been reported: one (now disappeared) on a shingle spit at the Dion Islands on the Antarctic Peninsula, one on a headland at Taylor Glacier in Victoria Land, and most recently one at Amundsen Bay. Since 2009, a number of colonies have been reported on <b>shelf</b> <b>ice</b> rather than sea ice, in some cases moving to the shelf in years when sea ice forms late.|$|E
500|$|Ice {{shelves are}} not stable when surface melting occurs, and the {{collapse}} of Larsen Ice Shelf has been caused by warmer melt season temperatures that have led to surface melting and the formation of shallow ponds of water on the ice shelf. The Larsen Ice Shelf lost [...] of its area from 1995 to 2001. In a 35-day period beginning on January 31, 2002, about [...] of shelf area disintegrated. The ice shelf is now 40% the size of its previous minimum stable extent. In 2015 a study concluded that the remaining Larsen B ice-shelf will disintegrate {{by the end of the}} decade, based on observations of faster flow and rapid thinning of glaciers in the area. Jones Ice Shelf had an area of [...] in the 1970s but by 2008 it had disappeared. Wordie Ice Shelf has gone from an area of [...] in 1950 to [...] in 2000. Prince Gustav Ice Shelf has gone from an area of [...] to [...] in 2008. After their loss the reduced buttressing of feeder glaciers has allowed the expected speed-up of inland ice masses after <b>shelf</b> <b>ice</b> break-up. The Ross Ice Shelf is the largest ice shelf of Antarctica (an area of roughly [...] and about [...] across: about the size of France). Wilkins Ice Shelf is another ice shelf that has suffered substantial retreat. The ice shelf had an area of [...] in 1998 when [...] was lost that year. [...] In 2007 and 2008 significant rifting developed and led to the loss of another [...] of area and some of the calving occurred in the Austral winter. The calving seemed to have resulted from preconditioning such as thinning, possibly due to basal melt, as surface melt was not as evident, leading to a reduction in the strength of the pinning point connections. The thinner ice then experienced spreading rifts and breakup. This period culminated in the collapse of an ice bridge connecting the main ice shelf to Charcot Island leading to the loss of an additional [...] between February and June 2009.|$|E

40|$|Antarctic <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> play a {{key role}} in the global climate system, acting as {{important}} sites for the cooling of shelf waters, thereby facilitating deep and bottom water formation. Many of the processes that take place under large <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> can be observed more conveniently beneath smaller <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> such as Fimbul <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf,</b> an <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> in the eastern Weddell Sea. Fimbul <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf</b> and nearby <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> might also play a significant regional role: although no bottom water is produced in this area, it is thought that Fimbul <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf</b> and nearby <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> precondition the shelf waters that ultimately are converted to Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW) in the southern Weddell Sea. Using the first data ever to be collected beneath an <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), as well as data from the vicinity of the <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> using traditional oceanographic methods, this thesis discusses the circulation and processes occurring beneath the <b>ice</b> <b>shelf.</b> This has been supplemented by using a coupled ice shelf/ocean model, POLAIR, to simulate the circulation, melting, and tides under Fimbul <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf</b> and in the surrounding area. Data from the <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> cavity show relatively large variability in temperatures, but all within approx. 0. 25 °C of the freezing point. Melt rates are found to be lower than some previous model studies, but in better agreement with observations and glaciological models. The base of the <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> was found to be rough in places, corresponding to `flow traces' visible in satellite imagery. This could have implications for mixing beneath the <b>ice</b> <b>shelf,</b> at least in these limited areas. The Autosub AUV was found to be a useful platform for measuring hydrography and <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> cavity geometry with spatial coverage and resolution not available from surface measurements.

50|$|Liu's work on iceberg calving and <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> {{retreat in}} Antarctica used {{satellite}} images to measure all icebergs larger than 1 km2 calving {{from the entire}} Antarctic coastline, {{and the state of}} health of all the <b>ice</b> <b>shelves.</b> Some large <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> are growing while many smaller <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> are shrinking. They found high rates of iceberg calving from Antarctic <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> that are undergoing basal melt-induced thinning, which suggests the fate of <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> may be more sensitive to ocean forcing than was previously thought.|$|R
5000|$|Stange <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf</b> (...) , is an Antarctic <b>ice</b> <b>shelf</b> in Stange Sound, English Coast, bounded to {{the east}} by Spaatz Island, to the {{northwest}} by Smyley Island, and to the west by fast ice in Carroll Inlet. Named in association with Stange Sound. In contrast to the some other <b>ice</b> <b>shelves</b> on the Antarctic Peninsula, for example the Larsen <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf,</b> the Stange <b>Ice</b> <b>Shelf</b> has been relatively stable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shelf</b> <b>ice</b> is a {{floating}} mat of ice, but unlike a pond {{or a small}} lake that freezes over, the shelf is not a uniform sheet of ice. Created by the wind and waves, the <b>shelf</b> <b>ice</b> is a jumble of ice chunks, pushed onto each other. It is as if you took a pile of rubble and pushed up against a wall. The more you push, the narrow the pile becomes, and it rises in a ridge. But there is nothing stable in the pile. The individual pieces (ice {{in the case of}} <b>shelf</b> <b>ice)</b> are not initially connected; they only float upon the water surface and rest upon each other. Many become jammed together but throughout the structure, there are pockets of air. Since each piece of ice developed independently, each is of a different thickness, creating variations in strength, density, and depth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shelf</b> <b>ice</b> is {{ice that}} forms when {{a portion of}} a lake surface freezes. It is often then washed upon the shore. The {{phenomenon}} is common within the Great Lakes.|$|E
50|$|Typically, a shelf front {{will extend}} forward for years or decades between major calving events.

50|$|The North-west White Island Antarctic Specially Protected Area {{comprises}} a 142 km2 area {{of coastal}} <b>shelf</b> <b>ice</b> on the north-west side of White Island in the Ross Archipelago of Antarctica.The site {{has been designated}} an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA 137) because it supports an unusual small breeding population of Weddell seals, which {{is not only the}} most southerly known, but which has also been physically isolated from other populations by the advance of the McMurdo and Ross ice shelves. The first seals in the area were recorded in 1958, since when the population has grown to 25-30. The seals utilise the open waters of McMurdo Sound but do not have the breathing capacity to reach the open ocean by swimming beneath the intervening 20 km of permanent <b>shelf</b> <b>ice.</b>|$|E

30|$|Another {{problem is}} the {{misinterpretation}} of the signal from <b>ice</b> <b>shelves,</b> landfast <b>ice,</b> and icebergs as that from areas of thin ice. These types of ice generally exist adjacent to coastal polynyas, and their microwave characteristics can be {{similar to those of}} thin ice. To overcome this problem in the Antarctic, <b>ice</b> <b>shelves,</b> landfast <b>ice,</b> and icebergs are discriminated from thin sea ice by using a scatter plot of vertical versus horizontal polarization brightness temperatures (TBs) (Tamura et al. 2007, 2015; Nihashi and Ohshima 2015).
