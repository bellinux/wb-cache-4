The family moved in 1897 to Waco and in 1901 to Fort Worth. McMillin's father was a meat packer. As a child, Bo was known to pick fights, but was also known all his life as one who never drunk nor smoked nor swore. He <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{distinctive}} Texas drawl.|$|E
5|$|Although Mansfield's transformations between Jekyll and Hyde {{included}} lighting {{changes and}} makeup designed to appear different under colored filters, it was mainly accomplished by the actor's facial contortions {{and changes in}} posture and movement. As Hyde, Mansfield was hunched over with a grimacing face and claw-like hands; he <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> guttural voice and walked differently than he did as Jekyll. The effect was so dramatic that audiences and journalists speculated {{about how it was}} achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber prosthetic, that he applied chemicals, and that he had a mask hidden in a wig, which he pulled down to complete the change.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1794, Thomson <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{ship that}} was sailing for Botany Bay. The ship had {{encountered}} a French privateer, of 14 guns, which the British ship managed to drive off after an engagement that lasted almost two hours. Reportedly, Prince of Wales {{went on to}} recapture a British brig that a French 74-gun ship of the line had captured. Prince of Wales sent the brig into Oporto. However, {{this may have been}} Best. Lastly, in early 1974, Prince of Wales captured and brought in Flugen, of Malmö, which had been carrying wine, brandy, and bale goods from Bordeaux to Saint-Domingue.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} the Western Conference Final in the 2006 playoffs, the newly renamed Anaheim Ducks entered the 2006–07 season with high expectations; the team brought Selänne {{back with a}} one-year, $3.75 million contract. He reached several milestones during the season: Selänne became the 36th player in NHL history, and second Finn after Jari Kurri, to score 500 goals, on November 22, 2006, against Colorado. On December 31, he played his 1,000th NHL game. As part of a season in which he again led Anaheim in goals (48) and points (94), Selänne played in his tenth All-Star Game in 2007, and scored his first hat-trick in six years (the 19th of his career) on January 12, 2007. It was the same day he <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> friend in Finland with terminal cancer and whom asked to be sent the game puck if Selänne had a three-goal game. Finally, he scored his 301st goal as a Duck on February 18, 2007, to break Paul Kariya's franchise record.|$|E

25|$|The unknown man had {{a slender}} build, short grey hair, and {{appeared}} to be in his late 50s or early 60s. He stood five feet and ten and a half inches tall with blue eyes and a tan complexion. From witness reports, the man was of Germanic descent and <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> thick German accent. He was neatly groomed; his face was shaven and his hair was clean and combed.|$|E
60|$|He <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air of candour, but it {{was quite}} evident that he was ill at ease.|$|R

25|$|Later that day, armored {{vehicles}} sealed off the presidential palace, and reporters heard 10 minutes of automatic gunfire near {{the headquarters of}} the Malian state broadcaster, whose programmes went off the air. Soldiers blocked the path to the buildings. The Associated Press <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> soldier who said that when soldiers entered the palace, Touré's bodyguards did not defend the building. The mutinying soldiers searched the area for Touré, but he was not caught.|$|E
25|$|Septimius Severus {{grew up in}} {{the town}} of Leptis Magna. He spoke the local Punic {{language}} fluently and possibly the Berber language too, but he was also educated in Latin and Greek, which he <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slight accent. Little else is known of the young Severus' education, but according to Cassius Dio the boy had been eager for more education than he had actually got. Presumably Severus received lessons in oratory: at age 17 he gave his first public speech.|$|E
25|$|Whitmer {{was born}} near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, {{the fourth of}} nine {{children}} of Peter Whitmer, Sr. and Mary Musselman. Whitmer's ancestry {{on both sides of}} his family were German, and the family <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> German accent. His grandfather was George Witmer, who was born in Prussia, and his great-grandfather was born in Switzerland. By the 1820s, the Whitmer family had moved to a farm in Fayette, in New York's Finger Lakes area. On March 12, 1825, Whitmer was elected sergeant in a newly organized militia called the Seneca Grenadiers.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, Togawa <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> local {{hunter who}} claimed to have killed a large cat with fur like a tiger's. He {{disposed}} of the body, and Haemi on {{the southern part of the}} island, where the body was disposed of, was searched. The hunter said that, until ten days prior to the interview, the cat's skeleton was still where he had left it, but the recent rains had washed it away. He described that cat as having a shoulder height that reached an adult human's knee, a tail that was 60 centimeters long, a body twice as large as a house cat's, and greenish striped fur.|$|E
25|$|In August 1796, both Canada and Nova Scotia were {{stirred by}} the news that Admiral Richery had escaped the {{vigilance}} of Admiral Robert Mann out of Cadiz, and was proceeding to Newfoundland with seven sail {{of the line and}} several frigates. Against this force Vice-Admiral Wallace at St. John's could only oppose the old Romney of 50 guns, two 32's and two 16's. Captain Taylor, in Andromeda, of thirty-two guns, had parted for the banks with orders to cruise there {{for the protection of the}} sea trade. On 3 September he <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> schooner, the master of which informed him that he had seen on the coast an enemy's fleet, consisting of several ships of the line and frigates. Subsequent reports increased alarm on the mainland by telling of French landings in Conception Bay.|$|E
500|$|... "Pinkeye" [...] {{included}} the first appearance of Principal Victoria, {{the principal of}} South Park Elementary. Her appearance is based on Comedy Central executive Debbie Liebling, {{who served as a}} South Park producer {{at the time of the}} episode's broadcast. Unlike Liebling, however, Principal Victoria <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> thick Minnesotan accent; the voice was chosen simply because it was an accent voice actress Mary Kay Bergman could do particularly well.|$|E
60|$|She stood quite still, {{before the}} Doctor, and <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> earnestness that thrilled me. Yet {{her voice was}} just as quiet as before.|$|R

500|$|Ulysses S. Grant {{described}} Bennet Riley as [...] "the finest {{specimen of}} physical manhood I had ever looked upon...6'2 (190cm) in his stocking feet, straight as the undrawn [...] bowstring, broad shouldered with every limb in perfect proportion, with an eagle and a step {{as light as}} a forest tiger." [...] An accident or injury in his youth caused him to lose part of his palette, and he <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hoarse voice.|$|E
500|$|The Manchester Guardians music critic, Neville Cardus, met Delius {{during the}} festival. He {{describes}} {{the wreck of}} the composer's physique, yet [...] "there was nothing pitiable about him... his face was strong and disdainful, every line graven on it by intrepid living". Delius, Cardus says, <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> noticeable Yorkshire accent as he dismissed most English music as paper music that should never be heard, written by people [...] "afraid of their feelin's".|$|E
500|$|Early in his career, West's West Virginian roots {{made him}} target for some mild jeering. He <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high pitched voice that became even shriller {{when he became}} excited, so that Lakers captain Elgin Baylor dubbed West [...] "Tweety Bird". His Appalachian accent was so thick that one coach {{interrupted}} him {{and asked him to}} speak English. Baylor once commented: [...] "Rumors are safe with you, Tweety Bird. You pass them on, but nobody can understand you." ...|$|E

500|$|The name Hives, used by Shearsmith's character, {{was taken}} from a Laurel and Hardy butler of the same name. Meanwhile, Hives's costume and mannerisms were {{inspired}} by those worn and adopted by Noel Edmonds in undercover practical jokes. A related influence for the episode was a prank-gone-wrong seen on YouTube, in which a joke's target punches a costumed person when the latter surprises the former. Pemberton's character <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cockney accent, something unusual for Pemberton, who normally does not affect accents when acting. In addition to playing Pete, Pemberton provided the deep voice spoken by [...] "Madam Talbot" [...] during the séance.|$|E
500|$|Shooting {{began in}} May 1953, with an {{abandoned}} beer hall in Spandau {{serving as the}} principal shooting location. Among the cast and crew, only the lead actors and director Worsley spoke English. Worsley would recall the production difficulties this caused: [...] "No matter what galaxy we explored, everyone <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> German accent. The use of German actors who could not speak English required us to {{use a lot of}} close-ups. I would stand behind the camera, correctly positioned for the actor's look, and read his or her line; the actor would then repeat the line, mimicking my pronunciation and emphasis." ...|$|E
500|$|Isabeau's life is well documented, {{most likely}} because Charles' illness placed {{her in an}} unusual {{position}} of power. Nevertheless, not much is known about her personal characteristics, and historians even disagree about her appearance. She is variously described as [...] "small and brunette" [...] or [...] "tall and blonde". The contemporaneous evidence is contradictory: chroniclers said of her either that she was [...] "beautiful and hypnotic, or so obese through dropsy that she was crippled." [...] Despite living in France after her marriage, she <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heavy German accent that never diminished, which Tuchman describes as giving her an [...] "alien" [...] cast at the French court.|$|E
