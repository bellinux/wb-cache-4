These networks are easily prone to security attacks. Unattended installation of sensor nodes in the environment causes many security threats in the wireless sensor networks. There are many possible attacks on sensor network such as <b>selective</b> forwarding, <b>jamming,</b> sinkhole, wormhole, Sybil and hello flood attacks.

40|$|Abstract—Securing {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) is a hard problem. In particular, {{network access}} control is notoriously difficult to achieve due to the inherent broadcast characteristics of wireless communications: an attacker can easily target any node in its transmission range and affect large parts of a sensor network simultaneously. In this paper, we therefore propose a distributed guardian system to protect a WSN based on physically regulating channel access by means of selective interference. The guardians are deployed alongside a sensor network, inspecting all local traffic, classifying packets based on their content, and destroying any malicious packet while still on the air. In that sense, the system tries to gain “air dominance ” over attackers. A key challenge in implementing the guardian system is the resulting real-time requirement in order to classify and destroy packets during transmission. We present a USRP 2 software radio based guardian implementation for IEEE 802. 15. 4 that meets this challenge; using an FPGA-based design we can even check for {{the content of the}} very last payload byte of a packet and still prevent its reception by a potential victim mote. Our evaluation shows that the guardians effectively block 99. 9 % of unauthorized traffic in 802. 15. 4 networks in our experiments, without disturbing the legitimate operations of the WSN.

With the internal knowledge of protocol specifications and network secrets can launch low-effort jamming attacks that are difficult to detect and counter. In this proposed work wireless packets are observed and analyzed using hidden approaches. Attacks are observed either system services or web service attacks are identified and then we provide a solution to stop these jamming type of attacks. Proposed model evaluates robust <b>selective</b> <b>jamming</b> attacks detection mechanism while performing real-time packet classification at the physical layer. To mitigate these attacks, we develop three schemes that prevent real-time packet classification by combining cryptographic primitives with physical-layer attributes. We analyze the security of our methods and evaluate their computational and communication overhead...|$|E
40|$|Wireless Networks constituting a {{large number}} of nodes are {{becoming}} viable solution to many challenging commercial, domestic, and military applications. Wireless Networks collect and disseminate information from the fields where ordinary networks are unreachable for various environmental and strategic reasons. Wireless networking has {{emerged as one of the}} most promising concept for auto-configurable and self-organizing wireless networking to provide flexible and adaptive wireless connectivity to mobile users. Wireless networks can be vulnerable to active and also passive attacks. These types of attacks include Denial- of- Service (DoS), Man- in- the- Middle (MITM), spoofing, jamming, war driving, network hijacking, packet sniffing, and many more. This paper presents a way for countering <b>selective</b> <b>jamming</b> attacks in wireless networks...|$|E
