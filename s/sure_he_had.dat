25|$|According to a {{contemporary}} account written in early 1862, Ward {{and his brother}} arrived in Shanghai, China in 1860 {{for the purpose of}} trading, perhaps as an extension of their father's New York office. This may be true, but given Ward's activities in the 1850s it is almost certain that Ward had ulterior motives for his return. We can be <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> little respect for the Shanghai business practices, which he dismissed as “lying, swindling and smuggling”. Their arrival coincided with a buildup of Taiping forces in the area.|$|E
25|$|On 29 April 1952, Straffen {{went with}} an {{attendant}} and another patient to clean some outbuildings that {{were close to}} the 10-foot-tall external wall. In a small yard immediately adjacent to the wall was a low shed with a sloping roof that was 8½ feet high at its highest point. In the yard were empty disinfectant tins. Straffen asked his supervisor if he could shake his duster and, on receiving permission, went into the yard. Once the other patient had gone back in, Straffen climbed onto the roof and jumped over the wall. He had already made <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> his civilian clothes under his work clothes.|$|E
25|$|The move {{worked and}} he evaded the British {{for a short}} time. Lütjens then broke radio silence, {{allowing}} the British a rough idea of his latitude but not his longitude. He continued {{to believe he was}} being tracked. Naval Group West informed him to send only tactical radio signals and not risk broadcasting long radio messages to Paris since they were <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> broken contact. Lütjens, already distrustful of B-Dienst, disregarded the warnings. Fortunately, not until late evening on 25 May, did the British realise he was heading for France. By this time Lütjens was well ahead of his pursuers. It proved, however, to be a grave error. Though the British made a number of mistakes in locating her, the intercepted message allowed them to send to air strikes against the ship over the next two days.|$|E

25|$|Upon Askin's {{retirement}} in January 1975, Willis {{was seen as}} the favourite to take the premiership. However, despite Askin's initial support, Willis refused his help, preferring to gain the leadership on his own merits. Askin then put his support behind the Minister for Lands, Tom Lewis. Willis, <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> support, refused to campaign, and the party put its support behind Lewis, leading to his election to Premier. Willis was then replaced as Deputy by John Maddison. For his service as Deputy Leader he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) on 14 June 1975.Citation: Deputy Premier of New South Wales (sic) Lewis was Premier for only one year and looked increasingly likely to lead the state Liberals to defeat. At the party room meeting on 20 January 1976, parliamentary backbencher Neil Pickard called a spill motion. This was carried 22 votes to 11 and Willis was made Leader and Premier unopposed. Willis and his Cabinet were then duly sworn in on 23 January by the Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales, Sir Laurence Street.|$|E
500|$|In December 1892, the {{congregation}} expelled Rosenberg, charging him with eating {{a piece of}} pork, which is not kosher. To augment his salary of $400 (today $) a year from Beth Jacob, Rosenberg also worked as an agent for a cigar company. While visiting a customer at a bar, he was alleged to have eaten the pork while partaking {{of some of the}} free lunch provided there. Rosenberg initially said that while he had drunk a great deal, he had not eaten anything at all, and subsequently stated that he was <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not eaten pork, because the bar-keep had sworn in affidavit that there was none in the lunch provided that day. Rosenberg later averred consistently that if he had eaten any pork, it was inadvertently. He also alleged hypocrisy {{on the part of the}} members, stating [...] "They are all reformed Jews in private, although orthodox Jews in public." ...|$|E
500|$|With no {{knowledge}} of the fashion industry, Morgan decided to make a film on the topic after being shocked by the news of the collapse of Rana Plaza. After spending several days getting information, and discovering the industry's human rights violations and [...] "staggering environmental impacts", he was <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to make the film. He had also previously had an appreciation for the genre, saying he was [...] "actually fascinated by those [...] films that follow one person". Like Morgan a non-connoisseur of fashion, executive producer and eco activist Lucy Siegle said that she does not like such films as they are usually limited to exploring the aesthetic aspects of the industry. It is The True Cost differential in her opinion; it [...] "goes there and then someit unravels the grim, gritty, global supply chain of fast fashion". Nevertheless, the film purposely does not give viewers a clear answer on how to solve the problems as there are [...] "no straightforward answers". Morgan commented, [...] "I'm probably most proud that we avoided easy answers and instead chose to trust people to both feel and think deeply about the issues raised." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Burks, Hubbard [...] "was so <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{something}} 'away out and beyond' {{anything else}} that he had sent telegrams to several book publishers, telling them that he had written 'THE book' {{and that they were}} to meet him at Penn Station, and he would discuss it with them and go with whomever gave him the best offer." [...] However, nobody bought the manuscript. Forrest J Ackerman, later Hubbard's literary agent, recalled that Hubbard told him [...] "whoever read it either went insane or committed suicide. And he said that {{the last time he had}} shown it to a publisher in New York, he walked into the office to find out what the reaction was, the publisher called for the reader, the reader came in with the manuscript, threw it on the table and threw himself out of the skyscraper window." [...] Hubbard's failure to sell Excalibur depressed him; he told his wife in an October 1938 letter: [...] "Writing action pulp doesn't have much agreement with what I want to do because it retards my progress by demanding incessant attention and, further, actually weakens my name. So you see I've got to do something about it and at the same time strengthen the old financial position." [...] He went on: ...|$|E

His father is killed not long after and at that moment, he vows to seek justice. At night, he becomes a devil-modeled vigilante who takes justice into his hands. Affleck was cast in October 2001. Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that [...] "comic-strip stuff isn’t really my cup of tea, really." [...] Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. [...] He claimed that he and Ben [...] "loved that comic book but I just didn't quite believe in the script or the director at the time." [...] Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck made <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it [...] "serendipity in action" [...] that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the [...] series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying [...] "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me." [...] Additionally, he said, [...] "I didn't want someone else to do it, because I was afraid that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{his second}} season he was called up by the West Indies to tour India in the 1983–84 season. Richardson joined a {{successful}} West Indies Test team captained by Clive Lloyd batting in the middle order. His first tour started inauspiciously when Richardson lost his luggage and was left with few clothes. Veteran fast bowler Andy Roberts felt that Richardson was not getting enough practice as in the nets even bowlers were {{given a chance to}} bat ahead of him and by the time Richardson had an opportunity the main bowlers had finished. Roberts {{went out of his way}} to bowl at Richardson during the tour to make <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> some preparation.|$|E
2500|$|Dickens, who {{was aware}} that it was now taking him longer than before to write, made <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> built up a safety net of five serial numbers before the first went to {{publication}} for May 1864.

Following the crash, and while tending to the injured among the [...] "dead and dying," [...] Dickens went back to the carriage to rescue the manuscript from his overcoat. With the resulting stress, from which Dickens would never fully recover, he came up two and a half pages short for the sixteenth serial, published in August 1865. Dickens acknowledged this close brush with death, that nearly cut short the composition of Our Mutual Friend, in the novel's postscript: ...|$|E
2500|$|La Vie Claire's {{victories}} came at {{a critical}} juncture in cycling. [...] According to Greg LeMond [...] "a huge movement" [...] towards doping began in Italy around the early 1990s. [...] Many riders suddenly found themselves out of competition {{and a large number}} of riders unwilling to participate in [...] "the doping culture" [...] began to retire. LeMond said in 2001 that: [...] "Every rider on La Vie Claire was clean; that was Paul Koechli's big deal to make <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a clean team." [...] He added that his American and Canadian teammates, Andrew Hampsten and Steve Bauer, [...] "made it through clean." [...] Whether through coincidence or not, Paul Koechli and Steve Bauer drifted out of the sport, somewhat prematurely, around the same time that EPO began to be widely abused and steroids became outdated.|$|E

2500|$|Campese was brilliant. He {{scored the}} try {{running across the}} face of the defence. There were plenty of {{defenders}} in front of him, but because of the angle at which Campese was running they were all afraid to chase him, lest he gave a scissors pass to one of the Australians running outside him, or cut back inside himself. So each of the defenders played safe by making <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> his own zone of defence covered, but Campese kept running out of their zones, one after another. Finally, only John Kirwan was left, and he allowed Campese to turn him around. I suppose this was a mistake by Kirwan, but it did not matter anyway, because Campese had Phil Kearns and Rob Egerton in support, each of whom would otherwise have scored. Nevertheless, the fact Campese ended up scoring outside Kirwan was remarkable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Besides being {{involved}} {{in the early days of}} English ballet, Lopokova appeared on the stage in London and Cambridge from 1928, and was broadcast on the BBC as a presenter and in a number of acting roles; she read [...] "The Red Shoes" [...] over the BBC in 1935 (and a few years later reprised it for BBC television). She lived with Keynes in London, Cambridge and Sussex. [...] "Lopokova was [...] partner in founding the Cambridge Arts Theatre, and in advising him on the constitution for the Arts Council; with his financial input she became a moving spirit in the Camargo Society, which led to the creation of a national ballet company." [...] After her husband's collapse from an attack of angina in 1937, Lopokova devoted herself increasingly to taking care of his health. She supervised his diet and made <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> enough rest; [...] "without her constant attention and her joie de vivre, Keynes might not have made it to Bretton Woods." ...|$|E
