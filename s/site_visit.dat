A preliminary <b>site</b> <b>visit</b> was made by George Nakashima and the schematic design was completed in 1936. Although Raymond had envisioned that the dormitory would be completed in six months, Sri Aurobindo was concerned that the noise of construction would disturb the ashram, so he decided that the building would be constructed by its residents.|$|E
25|$|A second <b>site</b> <b>visit</b> (which {{conformed}} to DCHPO rules) occurred in early October 1981. Thompson {{was forced to}} hold a hearing in which GCA and WHA voiced their views on whether Thompson's previous visit had compromised the DCHPO approval process. On October 22, Thompson reissued her order approving the project. GCA sued to overturn the DCHPO order. On November 4, the D.C. Court of Appeals issued a temporary injunction enjoining construction of Washington Harbour. The court lifted its order on November 14, concluding that the hearing showed that Thompson's actions had not irreparably harmed the DCHPO permitting process and that the second <b>site</b> <b>visit</b> had been properly held. The city said it would issue building permits within a week, and Washington Harbour Associates said it would begin construction immediately thereafter.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} stock price impact of {{corporate}} <b>site</b> <b>visits</b> using a unique dataset of <b>site</b> <b>visits</b> to listed firms in China. Our main findings are as follows. First, the market reaction around corporate <b>site</b> <b>visits</b> is statistically and economically significant and is stronger for group visits, visits conducted by mutual fund managers, visits covering accounting and finance topics, visits to firms with poor information environments, and visits to manufacturing firms. Second, the stock returns around <b>site</b> <b>visits</b> are positively associated with firms’ future performance. Third, the changes in visiting funds’ holdings are more predictive of firms’ future performance than those of non-visiting funds.

40|$|Using {{the unique}} data of analysts’ <b>site</b> <b>visits</b> to Chinese listed companies, we examine {{whether and how}} analysts’ <b>site</b> <b>visits</b> help improve their {{forecast}} performance. We find that the forecast accuracy of analysts improves after they visit the target firms and this improvement still holds after controlling for the concurrent change in the forecast accuracy of analysts who do not conduct <b>site</b> <b>visits.</b> Such an improvement is more pronounced for firms with better corporate governance; for more experienced analysts; and for firms with higher earnings volatility. Moreover, the improvement of forecast accuracy is less pronounced when current <b>site</b> <b>visits</b> are preempted by preceding <b>site</b> <b>visits,</b> and when there are other non-analyst visitors. Furthermore, we find that local analysts benefit more from corporate <b>site</b> <b>visits</b> than non-local analysts. Lastly, we document a larger market reaction to earnings forecasts issued by visiting analysts than those issued by non-visiting analysts...|$|R

40|$|A key goal of {{including}} field <b>site</b> <b>visits</b> in marketing courses {{is to give}} business students increased interaction with industry pro-fessionals and community leaders. <b>Site</b> <b>visits</b> give students a concrete idea of how different marketing disciplines work in the busi-ness world.

Undergraduate students learn about careers in marketing early in their college education and graduate students realize new career opportunities.

This strategic research investigates the perceptions of students towards a number of different <b>site</b> <b>visits</b> each with particular characteristics.

25|$|The {{producers}} and director James Strong paid {{particular attention to}} the visual style of the reveal. Chibnall wanted to expose the murderer's identity visually and dynamically, not through dialogue in a static scene on a set. During a location <b>site</b> <b>visit</b> prior to filming, Chibnall, Strong, and Holmes walked from the house at Lavington Close to the house on St Andrews Drive. As they crossed a footbridge over the Land Yeo, Chibnall—struck by the scenery of the area—realised that a single, uncut point of view shot of DI Hardy walking through the Miller house, through the garden, and into the garden shed was the way to reveal the killer's identity. Chibnall and Strong decided that the shot in the first episode of Mark Latimer walking through the Broadchurch High Street should mimic this reveal shot in the eighth episode.|$|E
25|$|The CFA {{requested}} a <b>site</b> <b>visit</b> to see in-place mock-ups for {{the stone and}} glass walls and their lighting. The effectiveness of the photo-realistic elements were questioned by {{some members of the}} CFA, who pointed out that they created a time-bound (rather than timeless) memorial and had proven ineffective at the Korean War Veterans Memorial. Several commissioners also expressed very strong concern over the significant changes in the bronze panels. But CFA chair Earl A. Powell III (himself a Vietnam War veteran) strongly endorsed it, which appeared to mute these concerns. United States Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs Gordon H. Mansfield, a Vietnam War veteran who was paralyzed in combat, spoke movingly before the CFA in favor of the revised bronzes. Mansfield's testimony, given as a paralyzed individual and not in an official capacity, also helped to win over the CFA. The CFA also asked that the designers study the spacing and placement of the glass panels, the size of the gap between the two segments of the stone wall, and whether the stone wall might be broke into three or more sections. Commission members noted that the spotlights on poles might be eliminated, suggesting that light from surrounding buildings and street lights made them unnecessary. They {{requested a}} nighttime lighting study from the memorial planners to help decide the issue.|$|E

500|$|The couple {{set about}} {{planning}} {{a new house}} to replace the aging tower house, and in 1694 the Earl contacted Sir William Bruce, who promised to design [...] "a convenient little house, gardings and courts". The property was surveyed by John Adair, and the old tower house was taken down. The survey took {{the place of a}} <b>site</b> <b>visit</b> by Bruce, who was at this time under virtual house arrest, due to his political leanings, and suspected Jacobite sympathies. Design submissions were also obtained from James Smith and Robert Mylne.

500|$|In {{the case}} of the Mertens' water monitor, more {{commonly}} known as Merten's water monitor, there was only one region that was monitored, but over the course of 18 months. This region is located 70 kilometers south of Darwin, at the Manton Dam Recreation Area. [...] Within the Manton Dam Recreation Area, there were 14 sites set up to survey the population of water monitors, measuring abundance and site occupancy at each one. Seven surveys were conducted, each of which ran for four weeks and included 16 site visits, where each site was sampled twice per day for two consecutive days throughout the 4 weeks. Each <b>site</b> <b>visit</b> occurred between 7:30–10:30 AM, [...] and 4:00–7:00 PM, when Varanus mertensi can be viewed sunbathing on the shore or wrapped around a tree branch close to shore. The whole project lasted from December 2004 to May 2006, and unveiled a total of 194 sightings of Varanus mertensi in 1568 site visits. Of the seven surveys, abundance was highest during the second survey, which took place in February 2005, two months into the project. Following this measurement, the abundance declined in the next 4 surveys, before declining sharply after the second to last survey in February 2006. In the final survey taken in May 2006, there were only two Varanus mertensi observed. Cane toads were first recorded in the region of study during the second survey during February 2005, also when the water monitor abundance was at its highest {{over the course of the}} study. Numbers of the cane toad population stayed low for the next year after introduction, and then skyrocketed to its peak in the last survey during May 2006. When you compare the two populations side by side one can see clearly that the onset of the cane toads had an immediate negative impact on the Varanus mertensi, as their population began to drop in February 2005, which was when the first cane toads entered the Manton Dam Recreation Area. [...] At the end of the study, some scattered population of water monitors remained in the upper sites of the Manton Dam, which suggests that local extinctions occurred at certain shoreline sites within Manton Dam, but a complete extinction of the population did not occur.|$|E
