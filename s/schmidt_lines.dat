Between 1855 and 1900 {{there were six}} surveys to locate 120 degrees, with each locating 120 degrees of longitude differently. In 1872, Alexey Von Schmidt undertook the survey of the state line. He marked his survey line with stones, wood, and iron markers; {{the only one who}} placed such markers A new survey in 1893 showed that the Von <b>Schmidt</b> <b>line</b> was 1,600 to 1,800 feet west of the actual 120 degrees. However, California and Nevada both recognize the 1872 Von Schmidt survey and the 1893 survey as the state line.|$|R

25|$|Thanks to his scouts, Archduke John had a {{clear picture}} of his opponent's army. He ordered Frimont's advance guard to attack the French {{soldiers}} at Pordenone in the morning. At 6:00 am, the Austrians clashed with Sahuc's cavalry patrols. General-major Joseph von Wetzel's Grenz brigade attacked across the Noncello (Foncello) stream {{on the east side of}} the town, attracting the attention of the defending infantry. When General-major Josef von <b>Schmidt's</b> <b>line</b> brigade came down from the northeast, the French were compelled to stretch the 35th Line to cover the north side of town. Sahuc formed his horsemen north of the town, hoping to catch the Austrian attackers in the flank. But it was the French cavalry who were flanked when Frimont fell on them with four regiments of cavalry, routing them. Without cavalry support, the infantry in the town were forced to pull out.|$|R

However, the emerging {{evidence indicates that}} voters often have 'other-regarding preferences'(ORP), i. e., in deciding among alternative policies voters care about their payo¤s relative to others. We extend a widely used general equilibrium framework in political economy to allow for voters with ORP, as in Fehr- <b>Schmidt</b> (1999). In <b>line</b> with the evidence, these preferences allow voters to exhibit 'envy' and 'altruism', {{in addition to the}} standard concern for 'own utility'. We give sufficient conditions for the existence of a Condorcet winner when voters have ORP. This could open the way for an incorporation of ORP in a variety of political economy models. Furthermore, as a corollary, we give more general conditions for the existence of a Condorcet winner when voters have purely selfish preferences...|$|R

30|$|To {{support the}} {{quantitative}} assessment of the rating distributions’ stability, we applied Kendall’s W, an accepted consensus measure typically applied in ranking-type Delphi studies (<b>Schmidt</b> 1997). In <b>line</b> {{with the nature of}} the Delphi method, even the rating phase must not be terminated only based on quantitative criteria. Rather, the termination decision should also account for qualitative insights such as provided by the panelists’ feedback. It {{is important to note that}} we used Kendall’s W for measuring changes in consensus, not for measuring absolute consensus. We did so by comparing the Kendall’s W values for subsequent rounds. The reason is that we did not rank the identified reasons in relation to one another, but rated them individually. However, Kendall’s W only measures absolute consensus for rankings. Looking at changes in consensus is reasonable when striving for consensus in terms of stable rating distributions at the end of a Delphi study, i.e., minor changes in the rating results of two subsequent rounds (von der Gracht 2012). In round four, Kendall’s W was 0.08 and 0.06 for routine and nonroutine processes.|$|R
40|$|Verapamil, the {{prototype}} calcium channel blocker, reversibly inhibits cell proliferation in many normal and tumour cell <b>lines</b> (<b>Schmidt</b> et al., Cancer Res., 48, 3617, 1988). We {{have found that}} two closely related cell lines - B 16 murine melanoma cells and B 10. BR normal murine melanocytes growing in culture - behave differently {{in the presence of}} verapamil, and we are now utilising these two related cell lines to help elucidate the molecular basis of verapamil's antiproliferative effect. In this study, we studied cell cycle phase distribution and c-myc gene expression in both cell lines in the absence of verapamil, during incubation with verapamil and after the cells were washed free of verapamil. Our studies show that 100 microM verapamil rapidly blocks DNA synthesis in melanocytes but not in B 16 cells. Similarly, incubation with verapamil for 6 - 24 h results in a decreased c-myc signal in melanocytes, but a transient increase in c-myc expression in B 16 cells. After verapamil is washed from the cells following a 24 -h incubation with drug, c-myc expression increases in melanocytes as they begin again to proliferate, but decreases in B 16 cells as they begin to die. Our disparate results with these cell lines suggest that c-myc gene expression, regardless of its known involvement in growth control, is not the immediate target for verapamil's inhibitory action...|$|R
40|$|We derive a {{physical}} {{model for the}} observed relations between star formation rate (SFR) and molecular line (CO and HCN) emission in galaxies, and show how these observed relations are reflective of the underlying star formation law. We do this by combining 3 D non-LTE radiative transfer calculations with hydrodynamic simulations of isolated disk galaxies and galaxy mergers. We demonstrate that the observed SFR-molecular line relations are driven by the relationship between molecular line emission and gas density, and anchored by the index of the underlying Schmidt law controlling the SFR in the galaxy. Lines with low critical densities (e. g. CO J= 1 - 0) are typically thermalized and trace the gas density faithfully. In these cases, the SFR will be related to line luminosity with an index similar to the <b>Schmidt</b> law index. <b>Lines</b> with high critical densities greater than the mean density {{of most of the}} emitting clouds in a galaxy (e. g. CO J= 3 - 2, HCN J= 1 - 0) will have only a small amount of thermalized gas, and consequently a superlinear relationship between molecular line luminosity (Lmol) and mean gas density (¯n). This results in a SFR-line luminosity index less than the Schmidt index for high critical density tracers. One observational consequence of this is a significant redistribution of light from the small pockets of dense, thermalized gas to diffuse gas along the line of sight, and prodigious emission from subthermally excited gas. At the highest star formation rates, the SFR-Lmol slope tends t...|$|R
40|$|We derive a {{physical}} {{model for the}} observed relations between star formation rate (SFR) and molecular line (CO and HCN) emission in galaxies, and show how these observed relations are reflective of the underlying star formation law. We do this by combining self-consistent 3 D non-LTE radiative transfer calculations with hydrodynamic simulations of isolated disk galaxies and galaxy mergers. We demonstrate that the observed SFR-molecular line relations are not necessarily representative of a more direct tracer of the SFR. Rather, they are driven by the relationship between molecular line emission and gas density, and anchored by the index of the Schmidt law controlling the SFR in the galaxy. Lines with low critical densities (e. g. CO J= 1 - 0) are typically thermalized and trace the gas density faithfully. In these cases, the SFR will be related to line luminosity with an index similar to the <b>Schmidt</b> law index. <b>Lines</b> with critical densities greater than the mean density {{of most of the}} emitting clouds in a galaxy (e. g. CO J= 3 - 2, HCN J= 1 - 0) will exhibit significant emission driven by subthermally excited gas which owes its excitation to line trapping. The contribution to the total line luminosity from subthermally excited gas along the line of sight causes the line luminosity to increase with mean gas density superlinearly. Consequently the SFR-line luminosity index is less than the Schmidt index. Our model for SFR-molecular line relations quantitatively reproduces the slopes of the observed SFR-CO (J= 1 - 0), CO (J= 3 - 2) and HCN (J= 1 - 0) relations when a Schmidt law with index of ∼ 1. 5 describes the SFR. We use these results to make model distinguishing testable predictions for the SFR-molecular line relations of unobserved transitions...|$|R
