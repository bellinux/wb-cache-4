5|$|One unique {{feature of}} the ELCA {{calendar}} {{is that it has}} given congregations the options of two dates for the Transfiguration. Following most other Western Churches, the ELCA moved the Transfiguration from its August 6 date to the Last <b>Sunday</b> after Epiphany (the <b>Sunday</b> immediately preceding Ash Wednesday) as an option to the traditional Last <b>Sunday</b> after Epiphany in an effort to encourage a wider observance of the Transfiguration within congregations. However, the traditional date of August 6 was left on the calendar. Congregations were given the option of observing Transfiguration on the Last <b>Sunday</b> after the Epiphany and August 6, thus leaving open the possibility that the Transfiguration could be commemorated twice within a calendar year. In Sweden, Transfiguration Day is celebrated on the seventh <b>Sunday</b> after Trinity <b>Sunday,</b> which is the eighth <b>Sunday</b> after Pentecost.|$|E
5|$|Start and end dates {{vary with}} {{location}} and year.

Starting in 2007, most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the second <b>Sunday</b> in March to the first <b>Sunday</b> in November, almost two-thirds of the year. The 2007 U.S. change {{was part of the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first <b>Sunday</b> in April and the last <b>Sunday</b> in October, and Congress retains the right {{to go back to the}} previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been done. Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to Halloween as a reason to delay the change—to provide extra daylight on October 31.|$|E
