25|$|The {{prototype}} B-47's long, {{swept wing}} {{was prone to}} twisting during roll maneuvers which caused a dangerous behavior known as aileron reversal to occur at airspeeds lower than expected. Based on experience with earlier aircraft, Townsend proposed the use of <b>spoiler</b> <b>ailerons</b> on the B-47 to reduce this unwanted behavior. The use of <b>spoiler</b> <b>ailerons</b> to reduce wing twisting was first tested on the B-47, and although not used on production B-47s, became standard issue for lateral control on many later jets.|$|R

5|$|First {{deliveries}} {{began in}} March 1947 and a flight test program began that month that lasted {{three years before}} the major deficiencies identified were fully corrected. Carrier landing trials revealed a structural weakness of the rear fuselage when one aircraft was severed in half during a heavy landing. Severe vibrations in the tail upon engaging the arresting wire were cured by adding a roller bearing to the tailhook to counter the sideways forces placed on the tailhook. Other necessary changes were the addition of <b>spoiler</b> <b>ailerons</b> and an elevator control boost to improve the aircraft's poor controllability at low speeds. In addition, the cockpit layout was unsatisfactory {{and had to be}} redesigned. The NATC finally deemed the Mauler acceptable for carrier landings in August 1948 even though aircraft had been issued to one squadron earlier in the year and a new batch of 50 aircraft had been ordered in May. Despite all the modifications to the aircraft over its short life, it remained a maintenance nightmare, especially the leaky hydraulic systems.|$|R

40|$|Personnel of the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) Aerospace and Transportation Lab have {{completed}} a four-year grant program {{to develop and}} evaluate the pneumatic aerodynamic technology known as Circulation Control (CC) or Circulation Control Wing (CCW) for advanced transport aircraft. This pneumatic technology, which employs low-level blowing from tangential slots over round or near-round trailing edges of airfoils, greatly augments the circulation around a lifting or control surface and thus enhances the aerodynamic forces and moments generated by that surface. Two-dimensional force augmentations as high as 80 times the input blowing momentum coefficient have been recorded experimentally for these blown devices, thus providing returns of 8000 % on the jet momentum expended. A further benefit {{is the absence of}} moving parts such as mechanical flaps, slats, <b>spoilers,</b> <b>ailerons,</b> elevators and rudders from these pneumatic surfaces, or the use of only very small, simple, blown aerodynamic surfaces on synergistic designs which integrate the lift, drag and control surfaces. The application of these devices to advanced aircraft can offer significant benefits in their performance, efficiency, simplicity, reliability, economic cost of operation, noise reduction, and safety of flight. To further develop and evaluate this potential, this research effort was conducted by GTRI under grant for the NASA Langley Research Center, Applied Aerodynamics Division, Subsonic Aerodynamics Branch, between June 14, 1993 and May 31, 1997...|$|R

The present report deals with tests of <b>spoilers</b> and ordinary <b>ailerons</b> on rectangular Clark y wing models. In an effort to obtain satisfactory control throughout the entire angle-of-attack range that can be maintained in flight, various spoilers were tested in combination with two sizes of previously tested ordinary ailerons - one of average proportions and the other short and wide. In addition, one large spoiler was tested alone. It was found that when <b>ailerons</b> and <b>spoilers</b> are used together the full effect of both is not obtained if the spoilers are located {{directly in front of the}} ailerons. With the proper combination of <b>spoiler</b> and <b>aileron,</b> however, it is possible to obtain satisfactory rolling control up to high angles of attack (15 degrees to 20 degrees), together with favorable yawing moments and small control forces.

25|$|G-ADDR, {{the fifth}} Scion II, was {{retained}} by Shorts as an experimental testbed aircraft, {{and it was}} on this aircraft (temporarily designated M.3) that a scale wooden model of the slender wings (with Gouge flaps) for the later Empire boats was tested, the first flight in this configuration being conducted by Lankester Parker on 6 August 1935. With these flaps fitted it was tested at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which found that the Gouge flap decreased distance to take-off and stalling speed, among other improvements. Further work with standard wings was carried out; one flight from Rochester Airport, with experimental full-span flaps incorporating retractable <b>spoilers</b> instead of <b>ailerons,</b> was made on 22 July 1936; this idea proved unworkable, Lankester Parker having to draw on his considerable experience to coax the aircraft around on a single circuit before landing safely.

40|$|Tests of a partial-span {{model of}} a large bomber-type air 1 ane were {{conducted}} to determine the. aerodynamic characteristics of the wing equipped with full-span flaps and a retractable <b>spoiler</b> end <b>aileron</b> lateral control system. The arrangement consisted of (1) a double slotted flap extending over aproximate 1 y 86 percent of the wing semispan, (2) a 20 -percent constant-percentage-chord aileron extending from the outboard end of the flap to the wing tip, and (3) a retractable spoiler, located at the 65 -percent wing-chord station and extending from approximately 63 percent of the wing semispan to the wing tip. In addition, tests were made of a wing vent (of 1 and 2 percent of the wing chord located directly behind the spoiler), perforations in the spoiler, a blot or cut-out along the lower edge of the spoiler and spoilers of various spans. With full-span flaps deflected and with the 2 -percent vent open or closed the initial stalling of the wing occurred at the tips, but with the vents closed there probably would be no appreciable loss in lateral control until maximum lift was reached. The l-percent vent increased the rolling effectiveness of the spoiler at small spoi 1 er deflections, particularly at high angles of attack with flaps deflected. With flaps deflected the 2 -percent vent caused a large reduction in both the wing lift and rolling effectiveness of the spoiler at large angles of attack. However, at small angle of attack the 2 -percent vent increased the rolling effectiveness of the spoiler at small spoiler deflections. The simultaneous operation of the spoiler and vent (in contrast to a vent fixed in the wing) {{would result in a}} large increase in the effectiveness of the spoiler and would avoid any loss in wing lift as in a fixed vent arrangement. The tests of the spoiler modifications revealed that (1) the spoiler perforations reduced the rolling-moment and yawing-moment coefficients but caused the spoiler hinge-moment coefficients to become more positive; (2) the spoiler slot had no notable effect on the rolling-moment and yawing-moment characteristics but produced a positive increase in the spoiler hinge-moment coefficients at large spoiler deflections; (3) the effects produced by the individual modifications were additive when the various modifications were combined. In general, progressively decreasing the spoiler span by removing the segments from the inboard end of the spoiler caused a decrease in rolling effectiveness approximately proportional to the span of the segment...|$|R
40|$|This report {{contains}} a study {{about the possible}} benefits of changing the way large airliners are controlled in flight. The goal is to save fuel by decreasing the structural weight of the aircraft. Over the last decades the conventional primary control surfaces in civil aviation have not deviated from elevators, ailerons/spoilers and rudder. Eliminating one of these by compensating with others could hold revolutionary advantages. The research started out by finding alternative ways to control the aircraft around its different axes. This performance analysis was done with a Boeing 747 - 200 model in the RECOVER Benchmark tool with slight modifications. It was found that yaw control offered no decent alternatives besides the rudder. Pitch control can surprisingly be done with outboard ailerons, although it barely meets the requirements. This finding is attributed to the large sweep angle of the Boeing 747. Roll control offered the most alternatives due to many redundant control surfaces on the wings. Further analysis of unconventional roll control was split into four cases. The first case, flying without any ailerons, {{was determined to be}} unable to meet the legal requirements. However, the second case in which two spoiler surfaces were added to the existing six, was found to be satisfactory in all phases of flight. The efficiency of controlling the aircraft with <b>spoilers</b> instead of <b>ailerons</b> was addressed and a considerable difference was found but in the overall flight, this is not an issue. The third case was more moderate as it only removes the inboard ailerons. This case had no issues to meet requirements. The final case is entirely different: flying without spoilers. All roll requirements were met, but only after the outboard aileron was enlarged to within structural bounds. The larger issue with this case was the lack of airbraking features. The second phase of the project focused on evaluating the snowball effect in aircraft design caused by the small changes in the roll control mechanisms. First the weight of the removed components was estimated through a hydraulics model. This showed results ranging from 7 % to 20 % in subsystem weight decrease, depending on the case. The next step was to run these updated weights through a preliminary design phase. To facilitate the process the Aircraft Design Initiator was used. Two aircraft were reproduced and modified to assess the impact on different scales as well: the Boeing 747 - 200 and the Boeing 767 - 200, which is approximately half the size. It was found that the fuel percentage that could be saved for each case are 0. 50 %, 0. 36 %, 0. 18 % and 0. 45 % in respective order for the Boeing 747. Interestingly, these percentages are nearly identical to those of the Boeing 767. The impact on the operating empty weights does differ slightly, where the Boeing 747 loses more weight than the 767, percentage-wise. Being that the fuel saving on a standard harmonicmission profile is less than 0. 50 % for any of the cases of alternative roll control, the results are not revolutionary as they are now. The profitability of switching to these new control methods is debatable. Aerospace EngineeringFlight Performance and Propulsio...|$|R
