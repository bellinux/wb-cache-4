40|$|A {{socioeconomic}} {{study was}} conducted on cassava cultivation and starch production in Cuatro Esquinas, Cauca (Colombia). The area is characterized by small landowners, with a cheap supply of labor, 2 rainy seasons, temperate climate, with cassava and coffee as the 2 most important cash crops. Twenty-four small-scale <b>starch</b> <b>factories</b> exist in the region, the constant demand for cassava has stimulated its production, although {{there has not been}} a major change in agricultural practices. <b>Starch</b> <b>factories</b> may be considered as simple or mechanical, processing 600 and 1200 kg of cassava/day, resp.; although in the latter, cassava shortage may reduce processing to 600 - 750 kg of cassava/day. Sharecropping is common. After initial manual land clearing, the soil is ploughed with oxen, there is no crop rotation, and the majority of farmers grow 3 consecutive crops of cassava in the same field. Intercropping systems used are cassava/plaintain, cassava/maize, cassava/beans and cassava/maize/beans. Chemical technology is limited to the application of insecticides to control ants; herbicides and fertilizers are not used due to negative attitudes and lack of sufficient knowledge on their advantages and disadvantages. Except for the small amount used for home consumption, all the cassava is sold locally to the <b>starch</b> <b>factories.</b> Credit facilities are limited. Present problems in cassava cultivation include the growing scarcity of cassava due to excessive demand and to a decrease in cassava yields (frog skin disease and deterioration of soil fertility), lack of capital and refusal of starch producers to buy fertilized cassava.

The presence of high salt concentration has been traditionally considered as inhibitory for biological wastewater treatment (Fusuwankaya et al. 2009; Kokabian et al. 2013) and caused paralysis of the original wastewater treatment system.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Starch</b> <b>factories</b> {{generate}} {{large amounts}} of cassava solid waste. A small amount is utilized for animal feed {{but most of it}} is discharged with deleterious effects to the envirounment. A edible food with a high content of insoluble dietary fiber (60. 9 %), named “partially hidrolyzed cassava waste ” (PHCW), was prepared from industrial cassava solid waste by an enzymatic process. PHCW or wheat bran (WB) were fed to model rats and both promoted digestive function effects, but PHCW produced the greatest effect. The insoluble fiber constituent from PHCW (and not the soluble fiber), promoted the greatest fecal bulking, fecal weight and defecation frequency in rats, as compared to WB. Such results indicate that the partially hydrolyzed cassava waste presents digestive function properties which allow it to be used as an adequate source of insoluble dietary fiber in the formulation of functional food for human nutrition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Wet cassava pulp is {{generated}} in large quantity during {{a production of}} cassava starch. Major utilization of the pulp is in animal feed manufacturing. During a period of low demand, this material could accumulate and decompose causing air pollution in areas surround the <b>starch</b> <b>factories.</b> This research used biomass desiccant prepared from cassava pulp in a bench-scale packed-bed adsorption system to study the dehydration of ethanol and n-propanol vapor at concentration near their azeotropic points. The sorption capacity {{was found to be}} 0. 053 and 0. 119 gwater/gdesiccant for ethanol and iso-propanol at concentration of 80 %(w/w) and 0. 109 gwater/gdesiccant for n-propanol at concentration of 65 %(w/w). Alcoholic solutions with concentration higher than their aqueous azeotropic points, which could not be achieved by normal fractional distillation, were obtained in all the experiments. This study elucidates that cassava pulp could be value-added, and water adsorption using cassava-derived desiccant could be an alternative technique for production of high purity alcohols...|$|R

40|$|In Brazil the {{development}} of cassava starch industries depends of the governance systems adopted between producers and <b>starch</b> <b>factories.</b> The methodology of transaction costs economy {{was used to evaluate}} the influence of the characteristics of transactions on governance systems adopted. For this, 37 cassava starch industries have been visited, all located in the main Brazilian producing regions. The analysis classified the governances into 4 types, from market to vertical integration. Characteristics of transactions have been separate in two groups, one including characteristics common to all the industry and one which individual characteristics. In the case of individual characteristics, the results were in agreement with the transaction cost theory. The increase in asset specificity and risk facilitates the adoption of institutional arrangements with more guarantees, such as contractual relationships and vertical integration. For characteristics of transactions homogeneous in all regions, the results indicate a preference for market, despite the existence of specific assets and high risk levels. This result {{can be explained by the}} existence of institutional uncertainty and higher costs for vertical integration. In this case, market relations become the governance with lower transaction costs...|$|R
