25|$|The takbir is <b>said</b> <b>again</b> and {{the hands}} are raised as {{previously}} described {{and the next}} position, bowing or ruku', begins. There is a difference in opinions in the Islamic schools of thought {{on the issue of}} raising hands other than the initial takbir. Hanafi, the largest school of thought, and also Maliki prescribe not raising the hands before proceeding to ruku'.|$|E

25|$|On April 30, 2004, MB2 Motorsports {{announced}} {{a partnership with}} CENTRIX Financial, LLC, coming on as an associate sponsor for the 01 and 10 cars. In addition, the team's original number 36 would be resurrected to field a third team part-time for Road course ringer Boris Said, who had driven the 01 for two races in 2003 which included a pole at Sonoma. Centrix was scheduled to sponsor two races, debuting with a 6th-place finish at Sonoma. Centrix sponsored <b>Said</b> <b>again</b> at the oval track Auto Club Speedway, where he finished one lap down in 30th. USG Sheetrock (an associate on the 01) came on to sponsor two more races for Said, DNQing at Watkins Glen and finishing 28th in the season finale at Homestead after a transmission failure late in the race.|$|E
25|$|It {{was said}} that Nottingham could not support a tramway company; that there was this, that, and the other special reason why {{it would be all}} moonshine in Nottingham. It was <b>said</b> <b>again</b> that the uneven roads would necessitate the {{employment}} of too many extra horses to make the company pay; but these prognosticators did not know that uneven roads create traffic; that people are ever ready to jump into a car, and even pay a full fare to simply ride {{to the top of a}} hill. Now it happens that these prophets are without honour in their native land. The tramways company is a great success in the town, as we shall see very soon. The first section was opened on September the 18th last year, the running being to and from the Railway Stations, the Trent Bridge , and St. Peter's Church. On that first day 2,277 persons were carried in four inside cars, which were worked by 27 horse, the fare being twopence all the way. But here is something rather good. In the week ending October the 5th (Goose Fair week mind) no fewer than 32,619 persons were carried in five cars; and this result was said by experienced men to be unparalleled in the history of tramways.|$|E
500|$|With polls {{released}} on October 6 showing Roosevelt well ahead, Willkie began to sound an isolationist theme, accusing Roosevelt {{of being a}} warmonger. Many of Willkie's speeches to that point had been on domestic issues, {{but he had been}} advised by Martin, Hamilton, and other advisors that the war was the issue the voters really cared about. Willkie began to argue that Roosevelt would not keep the U.S. out of war, but that he would. He was given room to make this argument by the United Kingdom's increasing success in the Battle of Britain, as it was clear a German invasion was not imminent. The polls showed voters responding positively to this new tack, and Willkie kept on this course {{for the remainder of the}} campaign. Roosevelt reacted by scheduling five speeches for the final days, in which he proposed to rebut Willkie's [...] "falsifications". The president stated, [...] "I have <b>said</b> <b>again</b> and again and again that your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars." [...] Willkie was prone to ad lib remarks, which sometimes led to gaffes: addressing steelworkers, he pledged to appoint a new Secretary of Labor, [...] "and it will not be a woman either". This allusion to Secretary Frances Perkins, the only woman to hold a cabinet position in American history to that point, did not aid him among female voters.|$|E

500|$|Languages differ {{widely in}} how much they rely on {{morphological}} processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called isolating, or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in {{the degree to which}} morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word bonus, or [...] "good", consists of the root bon-, meaning [...] "good", and the suffix -us, which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. These languages are called fusional languages, because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are agglutinative languages which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is Turkish, where for example, the word evlerinizden, or [...] "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ev-ler-iniz-den with the meanings house-plural-your-from. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called polysynthetic languages. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in Persian the single word nafahmidamesh means I didn't understand it consisting of morphemes na-fahm-id-am-esh with the meanings, [...] "negation.understand.past.I.it". As another example with more complexity, in the Yupik word tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq, which means [...] "He had not yet <b>said</b> <b>again</b> {{that he was going to}} hunt reindeer", the word consists of the morphemes tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq with the meanings, [...] "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and except for the morpheme tuntu ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1987 {{he stated}} that [...] "the things {{contained}} in [...] Third Secret correspond {{to what has been}} announced in Scripture and has been <b>said</b> <b>again</b> and again in many other Marian apparitions; first of all, that of Fatima in what is already known of what its message contains, conversion and penitence are the essential conditions for salvation".|$|E

2500|$|Many polysynthetic {{languages}} {{combine these}} two strategies, and also have ways of inflecting verbs for concepts normally encoded by adverbs or adjectives in Indo-European languages. In this way highly complex words can be formed, {{for example the}} Yupik word tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq which means [...] "He had not yet <b>said</b> <b>again</b> {{that he was going}} to hunt reindeer." [...] The word consists of the morphemes tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq with the meanings, reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative, and except for the morpheme tuntu [...] "reindeer", none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{linguistic}} typology, polysynthetic {{languages are}} highly synthetic languages, i.e. languages in which words {{are composed of}} many morphemes (word parts that have independent meaning but {{may or may not}} be able to stand alone). Polysynthetic languages typically have long [...] "sentence-words" [...] such as the Yupik word tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq which means [...] "He had not yet <b>said</b> <b>again</b> that he was going to hunt reindeer." [...] The word consists of the morphemes tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq with the meanings, reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative; and except for the morpheme tuntu [...] "reindeer", none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, in an {{interview}} with Benjamin Wiker, Flew <b>said</b> <b>again</b> that his deism was the result of his [...] "growing empathy with the insight of Einstein and other noted scientists that there had to be an Intelligence behind the integrated complexity of the physical Universe" [...] and [...] "my own insight that the integrated complexity of life itself – which is far more complex than the physical Universe – can only be explained in terms of an Intelligent Source." [...] He also restated that he was not a Christian theist.|$|E

2500|$|Jesus {{looked around}} and said to his disciples, [...] "How hard {{it is for the}} rich to enter the kingdom of God!" [...] The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "Children, {{how hard it is to}} enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." [...] The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, [...] "Who then can be saved?" [...] Jesus looked at them and said, [...] "With man this is im{{possible}}, but not with God; all things are possible with God." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Wei Shu (魏書; Book of Wei) and the Jiuzhou Chunqiu (九州春秋) gave {{different}} accounts on how Lu Su urged Sun Quan {{to go to}} {{war with}} Cao Cao. Lu Su attempted to use reverse psychology to persuade his lord by saying, [...] "Cao Cao is truly a formidable foe. He has engulfed Yuan Shao's territories and his military forces are very powerful. If he uses the might of a victorious army to invade a state that is weak and chaotic, he'll definitely win. Why don't we despatch our troops to assist him, while you send your family to Ye (Cao Cao's base in northern China)? If not, we'll be in danger." [...] Sun Quan turned furious and wanted to execute Lu Su, but Lu <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "The current situation is very urgent. Since you've other plans, why don't you provide aid to Liu Bei instead of executing me?" [...] Sun Quan agreed with Lu Su's idea, so he ordered Zhou Yu to lead his forces to help Liu Bei.|$|E
2500|$|Dian Wei {{later became}} a {{subordinate}} of Xiahou Dun, a general under the warlord Cao Cao. He was promoted to Major (司馬) for his efforts in battle. Around 194, Cao Cao attacked a rival warlord Lü Bu in Puyang (濮陽) and launched a surprise night attack on one of Lü's camps located 40-50 li west of Puyang. However, Lü Bu led reinforcements from Puyang and joined in the battle. Cao Cao and his forces were caught in an onrush by Lü Bu's forces. Dian Wei ordered dozens of men to gather around him, put on two layers of armour, discard their shields and arm themselves only with spears and jis. Another wave of enemy soldiers closing in from the west unleashed a barrage of arrows onto Dian Wei and his men. Dian Wei remained oblivious to the arrows and told his men, [...] "Let me know when the enemy is ten paces away." [...] The men did so. Dian Wei then <b>said</b> <b>again,</b> [...] "Let me know when they are five paces away." [...] The men then suddenly cried out in fear, [...] "The enemy is upon us!" [...] Dian Wei was holding on to a dozen jis, and he flung them at the enemy when they were near him. Each ji knocked down an enemy soldier {{and not a single}} ji missed its target. Lü Bu's forces retreated. By then, it was nearing dawn, so Cao Cao and his forces returned to their camp. Cao Cao was impressed with Dian Wei so he promoted the latter to Commandant (都尉). Dian Wei was placed in command of hundreds of Cao Cao's personal guards, who patrolled around Cao's tent. Dian Wei was a robustly built fighter, so the guards under his command were specially selected by him. In battle, Dian Wei and his men were always the first to charge into the enemy formation. Dian Wei was later promoted to Colonel (校尉).|$|E
