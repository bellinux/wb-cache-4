50|$|Stimulated by Moore's question, Mead and his {{students}} began a physics-based analysis of possible materials, trying to determine a lower bound for Moore's Law. In 1968, Mead demonstrated, contrary to common assumptions, that as transistors decreased in size, they would not become more fragile or hotter or more expensive or slower. Rather, he argued that transistors would get faster, better, cooler and cheaper as they were miniaturized. His results were initially met with considerable skepticism, but as designers experimented, more and more results supported his assertion. In 1972, Mead and graduate student Bruce Hoeneisen predicted that transistors could be made as small as 0.15 microns. This lower limit to transistor size was considerably smaller than had been generally expected. Despite initial doubts, Mead's prediction influenced the computer industry's development of <b>submicron</b> <b>technology.</b> When Mead's predicted target was achieved in actual transistor development in 2000, the transistor was highly {{similar to the one}} Mead had originally described.|$|E

40|$|In ultra {{low power}} design, the {{trade-off}} between power consumption and performance is fundamental. Adapting the supply voltage and the transistor threshold voltage or using parallelism influences this trade-off. But how does ULP design scale with deep <b>submicron</b> <b>technologies?</b> On the one hand, leakage will become relevant or even dominant {{to the power}} consumption of a circuit. On the other hand, variability issues require an increase in design margins leading to unacceptable power consumption. Unfortunately, there is no magic recipe to overcome these problems. This tutorial will discuss leakage-aware and variability-resilient design techniques to provide the designer with insight on how to design reliable ULP circuits in deep <b>submicron</b> <b>technologies.</b> To conclude, a case study will show the feasibility of robust ultra low voltage designs while achieving high performance. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Deep <b>submicron</b> <b>technologies</b> are {{beginning}} to scale poorly with respect to both power and performance. It {{is well known that}} adding timing assumptions to asyn-chronous circuits can help to simplify circuits and improve performance. Thus, applying timing assumptions can help to extend the effectiveness of technology scaling. However, employing timing assumptions in deep <b>submicron</b> <b>technologies</b> is risky because of the large process variations that are present. This thesis explores the use of low risk timing assumptions to improve asynchronous circuits. We begin with a well-established and robust asynchronous logic style, quasi-delay insensitive (QDI) circuits. We expose a timing assumption that exists in the feedback of QDI circuits and extend it for general use. We refer to the resulting logic family as relaxed quasi delay-insensitive circuits (RQDI). RQDI circuits main-tain much of the robustness of QDI circuits while providing improved power and performance. Evaluations show that replacing QDI circuits with RQDI equivalents can reduce area and energy by 20 % and 36 %, respectively. RQDI also allows for new types of circuits which are difficult to design usin...|$|R
