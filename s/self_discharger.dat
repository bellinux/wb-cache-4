40|$|The <b>self</b> <b>discharge</b> test at full {{state of}} charge, {{may not be}} a good one to detect subtle defects since the li-ion {{chemistry}} has the highest <b>self</b> <b>discharge</b> at full state of charge. One should characterize <b>self</b> <b>discharge</b> versus storage time for each cell manufacturer/design to differentiate between normal <b>self</b> <b>discharge</b> and that due to a subtle manufacturing defect. The various soft short test methods indicate that if this test is carried out at full discharge (0 % SOC) with all capacity removed (by lowering the current load in a stepwise manner to the same end of discharge voltage), then the cells need to be placed in storage for more than 72 hours to get a good analysis on the presence of subtle defects since it takes more than 72 hours to achieve voltage stabilization. If the cells are to be charged up even to a small percentage (ex. 1 %), 72 hours are sufficient to determine issues. However, the pass/fail criteria should be based on a valid OCV decline. Less than 10 mV voltage decline is not a good method to detect subtle defects. As mentioned in the first bullet, <b>self</b> <b>discharge</b> is a competing reaction when a charge is introduced and hence a characterization of the <b>self</b> <b>discharge</b> versus storage time is required to fully correlate voltage decline to a failure due to a subtle defect. Soft short test method cannot be relied on for defect detection because cells with and without voltage decline seemed to have similar defects and characteristics. Screening methods such as internal resistance and capacity as well as a 3 -sigma range for OCV, mass and dimensions should be used to screen out outliers. A very critical aspect in the understanding of subtle defects is to carry out destructive analysis of cells from every lot to confirm the quality of production and screen all cells and batteries in a stringent manner to have a high quality set of flight cells. <b>Self</b> <b>Discharge</b> Test: Fully charged cells shall be placed in Open circuit stand for 72 hours (OCV measurement twice a day); continue for total of 14 days with 1 reading per day 2.

With the limitation on other new battery types – such as low power density for lithium ion battery, high <b>self</b> <b>discharge</b> and short life cycles for high current discharge for nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery – researchers has revisited the possibilities to enhance lead acid battery technology.

Here, we report the use of a hybrid system composed of lead acid and nickel metal hydride batteries, with the positive PbO 2 electrode and negative MH electrode suspended in H 2 SO 4 and KOH gel electrolyte. The lead acid and NiMH sections are separated by the anion exchange membrane and cation exchange membrane respectively, with a neutral K 2 SO 4 solution (in the centre) sandwiched between the two membranes. It is anticipated that the construct of this hybrid cell would compromise the respective limitations of the individual lead acid or Ni-MH batteries.
