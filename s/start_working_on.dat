25|$|According to Dorothea Kehler, {{the writing}} period {{can be placed}} between 1594 and 1596, which means that Shakespeare had {{probably}} already completed Romeo and Juliet and had yet to <b>start</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> The Merchant of Venice. The play belongs to the early-middle period of the author, when Shakespeare devoted {{his attention to the}} lyricism of his works.|$|E

25|$|It {{should be}} mentioned, however, {{that there are}} also {{critical}} voices from environmental organisations for example. That is {{in part due to}} the fact that there are European Organic Regulations such as (EC) No 834/2007 or the new draft from 2014 but no comparable regulations for Integrated Farming. Whereas organic farming and the “Bio-Siegel” in Germany for example are legally protected, EU Commission has not yet considered to <b>start</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> a comparable framework or blueprint for Integrated Farming. When products are marketed as “Controlled Integrated Produce”, according control mechanisms and quality-labels are not based on national or European directives but are established and handled by private organisations and quality schemes such as LEAF Marque.|$|E

Farnham's first solo performances since 1981 were live shows with the John Farnham Band consisting of Brett Garsed on lead guitar, Sam See on guitar and Derek Pellicci, formerly of Little River Band, on drums. In early 1986, sound engineer Ross Fraser suggested to Wheatley {{that it was time}} to <b>start</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> the solo album.

25|$|In March 2006, CCP made a {{deal with}} Optic Communications to <b>start</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> {{bringing}} Eve Online to the Chinese gaming audience. Closed alpha testing was held on a small cluster for some time, with about 3,000 players chosen from an initial pool of 50,000. The Chinese open beta test began on June 13, 2006, and proved to be very popular, gaining numbers comparable to Eve Onlines main server cluster. In order to avoid the shock of quickly adding thousands of new players to the current server (Tranquility), CCP Games decided to launch Eve in China on its own server (Serenity). In 2011, CCP allowed its licensing agreement with CDC Games, which had acquired Optic in July 2007, to expire. CCP created a new partnership with TianCity to relaunch Serenity on December 11, 2012.|$|E

The two sides could not resolve their differences and Cetera left the band in July 1985.

It was while working with this family that Dix traveled to St. Croix, where she first witnessed slavery {{as one of the}} evils of the world. In 1831, she established a model school for girls in Boston, operating it until 1836, when she had another health breakdown. Dix was encouraged to take a trip to Europe to help aid her health by her physician. When she was there she met the other reformers who inspired her to <b>start</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> equal rights for the mentally ill. These reformers were Elizabeth Fry, Samuel Tuke and William Rathbone with whom she lived during the duration of her trip in Europe. In hopes of a cure, in 1836 she traveled to England, where she met the Rathbone family. They invited her as a guest to Greenbank, their ancestral mansion in Liverpool. The Rathbones were Quakers and prominent social reformers. At Greenbank, Dix met their circle {{of men and women who}} believed that government should play a direct, active role in social welfare. She was also introduced to the reform movement for care of the mentally ill in Great Britain, known as lunacy reform. Its members were making deep investigations of madhouses and asylums, publishing their studies in reports to the House of Commons.|$|E
