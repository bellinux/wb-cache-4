500|$|Half an {{hour after}} Michael Vaughan {{resigned}} from the Test captaincy, Collingwood relinquished charge of the ODI squad because it was affecting his ability to enjoy the game. Collingwood told his wife {{on the night before}} his century against South Africa {{that it was time to}} go. [...] He later explained, [...] "I've found the extra workload to be very difficult [...] [...] It's mentally tiring, and that's the top and bottom of it. [...] I want to have a <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face when I'm playing cricket, and, if I'd have kept going, I'm not sure that would have been the case." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{was running}} back and forth, literally, from the editing room with [...] Jonas Akerlund to working with Stuart, who was also mixing the music in the film. We were together, non-stop, all of us. Cutting 350 hours of film down to two hours. There {{are a lot of}} serious aspects to the movie. I needed a release. When I would go to Stuart's, and we'd go up to his loft, it was like, 'Honey, I want to dance.' I wanted to be happy, silly and buoyant. I wanted to lift myself and others up with this record. So, yes, the new album was a {{reaction}} to all the other stuff I was doing, which was very serious in nature. I hope that doesn't imply that I wanted to make a superficial record, because it's not. I want people to smile when they hear this record. I wanted it to put a <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face, too.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{that year}} the Boston Post {{disclosed}} that Muck {{had been having}} an affair with a 20-year-old in Boston's Back Bay and had written her a letter reading in part: [...] "I am on my way to the concert hall to entertain the crowds of dogs and swine who think that because they pay the entrance fee they have the right to dictate to me my selections. I hate to play for this rabble... a very short time our gracious Kaiser will <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> request and recall me to Berlin...

2500|$|Stuart Snyder, {{who oversaw}} Cartoon Network and other Turner Broadcasting System cable {{networks}} from 2007 to 2014, said he {{became interested in}} the new Clone Wars series immediately upon starting the job in May 2007. Snyder flew out to San Francisco, California to screen several episodes, and told Lucas the only place he wanted to see the show was on Cartoon Network. Snyder wished to create an action/adventure block of shows on Friday night in an attempt to rejuvenate Cartoon Network. Snyder expressed confidence that the shows would help boost ratings: [...] "You catch me at a time where I have a <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face because of our internal results". [...] "I can say there's a little bit of bragging on the third quarter for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Actor Nick Berry {{was cast}} to play Wicksy with minimal delay. Smith has {{described}} his casting {{as one of}} the fastest on record. [...] Berry auditioned in front of the soap's creators, Smith and Tony Holland, and was offered the part immediately. Berry was whisked into costume and make-up and given a new haircut, which Berry claimed was because the producers wanted to smarten his appearance up. Berry was already a fan of the soap {{at the time of his}} casting. He has told interviewer Dan Abramson, [...] "I auditioned on a Wednesday and then on Friday I arrived in Albert Square and began shooting my first scenes with Dirty Den, whom I had enjoyed watching on the box for some time. For my first few episodes, I walked around with a big <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face, grinning at everybody. It was funny." ...|$|E

With 'Ibiza', his follow-up single (released on Vixen records), he attained very large amounts of airplay in Ireland; this in turn led to several high-profile TV appearances (including RTÉ's Kenny Live show and Nighthawks).|$|R

60|$|Having {{advanced}} {{two steps}} his eye caught mine. I {{do not know}} whether he was moved by some unconscious <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> part;--for in truth I endeavoured to seem as indifferent as himself to the nature of his dress;--or whether he was invincibly tickled by some inward fancy of his own, but suddenly his advancing step ceased, a broad flash of comic humour spread itself over his features, he retreated with his back against the wall, and then burst out into an immoderate roar of loud laughter.|$|E

40|$|In this project, my aim {{has been}} to {{recreate}} scenes which make my heart beat a bit faster. Scenes which bring <b>smiles</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face the moment I cast <b>my</b> eyes <b>on</b> them. Scenes which raise excitement within me, taking me on a ride of longing, curiosity and fantasies. Through this project, I {{have come to understand}} the importance of looking within me and empowering the thoughts and interests which grow inspiration and spark fire in me. I chose to work with hats due to the value they once held amongst men in the olden day Iran and the strong roots of formality entangling them. The combination of such culturally and historically rich objects together with my young romanticized thoughts has been an inspiring journey for me. This project was followed by the idea of creating large showcase body related objects. I wanted to work in dimensions larger than the usual sizes of jewelry I have experience working with. I wanted them to draw attention and take over a room with their presence through for example their forms, colors, light, sound, dimensions...|$|R

60|$|The {{warmth and}} odour stole over my senses. I was neither hungry nor thirsty, but drugged with fatigue. With a fixed <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face (a smile betokening, as I believe now, little but {{feminine}} vanity and satisfaction after feeding on that strange heart), my thoughts went wandering. The sounds of skies and earth drowsed my senses, and I nodded {{off into a}} nap. The grinding of wheels awoke me. From a welter of dreams I gazed out through {{the opening of the}} barn at a little battered cart and a shaggy pony. And behold, on the chopped straw and hay beside me, lay stretched out, nose on paw, our enemy, the sheep-dog. He thumped a friendly tail at me, while he growled at my deliverer.|$|E
60|$|I {{lived through}} my twenty-four hours, and I {{have never been}} the same man since. Oh, I don't mean physically, {{although}} next morning, when they unlaced me, I was semi-paralyzed and {{in such a state}} of collapse that the guards had to kick me in the ribs to make me crawl to my feet. But I was a changed man mentally, morally. The brute physical torture of it was humiliation and affront to my spirit and to my sense of justice. Such discipline does not sweeten a man. I emerged from that first jacketing filled with a bitterness and a passionate hatred that has only increased through the years. My God--when I think of the things men have done to me! Twenty-four hours in the jacket! Little I thought that morning when they kicked me to my feet that the time would come when twenty-four hours in the jacket meant nothing; when a hundred hours in the jacket found me smiling when they released me; when two hundred and forty hours in the jacket found the same <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> lips.|$|E

60|$|I {{was unable}} to answer him, but I glanced back from the doorway to see him <b>smiling</b> after me. <b>On</b> <b>my</b> way down the stairs I bumped into the doctor as he ascended.

Nor will I live so. Death will break the knot if you will not do so, and I could die with a <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> lips, knowing that I was dying for your good and England's. If you will not break the bond death shall do so, and ere to-morrow's sun rises, either by your sacrifice or by my own hand, you will be free. Marry for the good of England. Here is the ring by which you pledged your troth to me," [...] and she took it from her finger and dropped it in the fire that blazed on the hearth. [...] "There is the end of it, but not the end of our love. I shall think of you, and pray for you always, Harold. Oh, my dear lord and master, do not make it too hard for me!"

60|$|I {{write on}} the instant, as you direct; and in a tragi-comic humour, for I have a tear in my eye and a <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> cheek. Dearest Darsie, sure never a being but {{yourself}} could be so generous--sure never a being but yourself could be so absurd! I remember {{when you were a}} boy you wished to make your fine new whip a present to old Aunt Peggy, merely because she admired it; and now, with like unreflecting and inappropriate liberality, you would resign your beloved to a smoke-dried young sophister, who cares not one of the hairs which it is his occupation to split, for all the daughters of Eve. I in love with your Lilias--your Green Mantle--your unknown enchantress!--why I scarce saw her for five minutes, and even then only the tip of her chin was distinctly visible. She was well made, and the tip of her chin was of a most promising cast {{for the rest of the}} face; but, Heaven save you! she came upon business! and for a lawyer to fall in love with a pretty client on a single consultation, would be as wise as if he became enamoured of a particularly bright sunbeam which chanced for a moment to gild his bar-wig. I give you my word I am heart-whole and moreover, I assure you, that before I suffer a woman to sit near my heart's core, I must see her full face, without mask or mantle, aye, and know a good deal of her mind into the bargain. So never fret yourself on my account, my kind and generous Darsie; but, for your own sake, have a care and let not an idle attachment, so lightly taken up, lead you into serious danger.|$|E

Everyone sounded barking, indeed on the verge of a nervous breakdown, perhaps because they had to cope with dialogue that could apparently only be delivered at ear-shattering volume.

Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured? If I had land under my feet. I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine.

She stands between me and memory, and with {{laughing}} eyes defies me not to see her, and I look and look, and the vision of the Cross grows more faint, and she stands there serene and white and silent, with blue eyes <b>smiling</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> treachery and scornful voice upraised, denying God and Christ. She is of the House of Cæsar and she is ignorant, and she laughs at my belief and scorns all thought of God, and I do find it in my treacherous heart to pity her and pitying her to kneel at her feet. And all the while a thousand demons shout mockingly unto mine ear: 'Thou art a traitor--a traitor to thy God--for were she to beckon, 'tis to her that thou wouldst go, forgetting all--thine immortal soul, thy crucified God...?' And thus do devils mock me, and my soul grows darker and darker and greater and greater grows the mystery, for my heart, broken, miserably doubting and weak, cries out not with resignation, not in patience, but in a spirit of angry rebellion: 'God, my God! why hast thou forsaken me?'" ...|$|R
