To provide better user experience, the web {{designers}} and programmers must know exactly how their users behave. In this thesis I have defined the minimum number of relevant user actions made on Digital Library of <b>Slovenia</b> – dLib. <b>si</b> to classify user’s profile and their fields of interest. The final result of the thesis is a usable framework with which the website owners can plan further development of the portal by analysing statistical database...|$|R

40|$|EXTENDED ABSTRACT: The Ljubljana City Library {{has been}} {{cooperating}} in the KAMRA project since its very beginning. KAMRA is a Slovenian cross regional portal joining central regional public libraries {{as defined in}} the Regulations on Central Regional Libraries. It was established in order to digitise local studies collections, to promote the collections and the cooperation among different local institutions. The paper outlines the problems related to the collection and selection of relevant library materials to be incorporated in the KAMRA portal. It deals with copyright regulations for web publications and outlines the importance of obtaining the copyright permission {{for the use of}} library materials which were digitised after they were exhibited in the physical form. The Ljubljana City Library often decides to digitise hard copies of important items of local studies collection exhibited in the Slovanska Library – a branch library of the Ljubljana City Library. For the needs of the KAMRA portal the Ljubljana City Library created the project My Street (Moja ulica) joining public libraries in the central Slovenian region. They research the history, development, culture and life of people living in particular streets and areas and publish their stories on the KAMRA portal. The City Library of Ljubljana tries to cooperate with other regional cultural institutions, associations and individuals thus enabling access to local information sources which would otherwise be hard to access. The paper also deals with the mission and concepts of the Digital Library of <b>Slovenia</b> (dLib. <b>si)</b> and the KAMRA portal {{as well as with the}} digitisation of local studies. At the end it points to the problem of lack of financial means for digitisation projects. </p...|$|R

It documents the development of organic farming and its policy and regulatory environment in ten selected CEE states between 1997 and 2003. The countries included in the research are the Czech Republic (CZ), Estonia (EE), Hungary (HU), Poland (PL), <b>Slovenia</b> (<b>SI),</b> Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Slovakia (SK), Bulgaria (BG) and Romania (RO). Countries were divided into two groups: the first group (CZ, EE, HU, PL and SI) was studied in more detail; a simplified questionnaire was used for the second (LV, LT, SK, BG and RO) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} land {{security management}} principles {{and practice in}} <b>Slovenia</b> (<b>Si)</b> by presenting a a real property transaction example that is formally described and modeled as a use case. first the legislation settings and {{the description of the}} dual real property registration system in Slovenia are shortly oulined. Then use case descriptions and UML diagramming examples of simplified real property transaction process are developed. The use case described is the sale of a whole urban built-up property with a detached house. Using the general-purpose Object oriented modeling language (UML) and following adopted system engineering methodology this transaction case is represented oil several diagrams: package, class, use case, activity and sequence (interaction). The article concludes with the analysis of the process, discussion of security pro vision for this real property transaction case, time span of similar transactions and the reasons for possible delays. Some considerations for improvements and reduction of the time needed can also be derived...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper first {{discusses}} polycentric regions, {{their features}} {{and how they}} can be detected by means of indicators of regional structure and mobility patterns, and why polycentric regions will be increasingly relevant to the future of mobility planning in the EU landscape. The paper discusses then the experience of six polycentric regions - Marche (IT), Central Alentejo (PT), Central Macedonia (GR), Rhine Alp (AT), Heart of <b>Slovenia</b> (<b>SI)</b> and Parkstad Limburg (NL) - that applied a Future Search (www. futuresearch. net) based methodology to urban mobility planning. It provides a critical analysis of the regions’ experience using the methodology and their plans to capitalise on its outcomes. This experience is used to develop and propose a Poly-SUMP participatory planning approach, with this new acronym being used for a new planning concept, i. e. Polycentric Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans. The paper discusses {{the pros and cons of}} the Poly-SUMP approach applied to the cities of polycentric regions, as opposed to the conventional methods used to elaborate Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans at the level of individual cities...|$|E
