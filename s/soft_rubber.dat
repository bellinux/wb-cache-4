5|$|One scene {{involved}} a burning head, {{which was created}} by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing <b>soft</b> <b>rubber</b> over the cast to simulate human flesh. It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and covered it with mortician's wax {{to make it look}} bumpy. Another special effect {{involved a}} spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance. It was created from cellulose, water and green food coloring. It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to the side of her face. Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose to get it in, then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful, and it looked so funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes.|$|E
25|$|PVC and jelly-rubber toys {{have been}} found to be {{problematic}} because they contain unsafe phthalates, softeners added to many plastics that are also found in some jewelry, food containers, and other <b>soft</b> <b>rubber</b> toys. Phthalates have been linked to health problems such as cancer and prenatal defects. Products made of PVC or jelly rubber cannot be sterilized. Manufacturers recommend using condoms with these toys if users share them.|$|E
25|$|Frescobol is {{a native}} Brazilian sport similar to tennis and cricket, played with a wooden racket and <b>soft</b> <b>rubber</b> ball on the beach with no scoring system. It began during the 1960s on Ipanema beach. Biribol is another native sport created in Birigüi, São Paulo state. It {{is a kind of}} volleyball played in a {{swimming}} pool. Peteca (shuttlecock) {{is a native}} sport which originated from indigenous games.|$|E
5000|$|High-performance {{tires are}} {{designed}} for use at higher speeds, and more often, a more [...] "sporty" [...] driving style. They feature a <b>softer</b> <b>rubber</b> compound for improved traction, especially on high speed cornering. The trade off of this <b>softer</b> <b>rubber</b> is shorter tread life.|$|R
5000|$|Slicks—rear tires with no {{tread pattern}} and <b>softer</b> <b>rubber</b> compound, for {{increased}} traction ...|$|R
50|$|Several {{improvements}} {{were made}} in 1969. The frame benefitted from additional stiffening and strengthening, which, together with an improved centre-stand, helped to improve ground-clearance which had been criticised. Slightly <b>softer</b> <b>rubber</b> mountings were introduced to reduce a vibration period at 1,500 to 1,900 rpm. A new model named Commando S was introduced with alternative styling having a different tank, mudguards and high-level exhausts.|$|R
25|$|It {{consists}} of a bar that is held {{in place in the}} wearer's mouth by straps or other devices. Unlike the metal bit that is most common in horse bridles, the bar of a bit gag is usually a <b>soft</b> <b>rubber</b> cylinder. It is not very effective in preventing speech, unless combined with mouth stuffing, although it will make it somewhat more difficult for the wearer to produce coherent speech. Occasionally, reins are attached. Because of the possibility of injury to the lips, the bit gag is not suitable for rough play.|$|E
25|$|The {{flexibility}} of rubber is appealing in hoses, tires and rollers for devices ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses; its elasticity makes it suitable for {{various kinds of}} shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration. Its relative gas impermeability makes it useful {{in the manufacture of}} articles such as air hoses, balloons, balls and cushions. The resistance of rubber to water and to the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in rainwear, diving gear, and chemical and medicinal tubing, and as a lining for storage tanks, processing equipment and railroad tank cars. Because of their electrical resistance, <b>soft</b> <b>rubber</b> goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves, shoes and blankets; hard rubber is used for articles such as telephone housings, parts for radio sets, meters and other electrical instruments. The coefficient of friction of rubber, which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet surfaces, leads to its use for power-transmission belting and for water-lubricated bearings in deep-well pumps. Indian rubber balls or lacrosse balls are made of rubber.|$|E
500|$|As {{with several}} other {{characters}} from Tekken 6, Lars was given an alternate outfit designed by a manga artist, with Lars' being done by Masashi Kishimoto, author of the manga Naruto. In redesigning Lars, Kishimoto removed his Tekken Force outfit and gave him one made of a <b>soft</b> <b>rubber</b> material, marked with a lion figure on his right arm. He also made multiple cuts for the belt on the back, so that Lars' kicking techniques would be possible. Also, on the outfit's back are the numbers for Sweden's telephone country code: [...] "46". In the Wii U version of Tekken Tag Tournament 2, Lars has an extra costume based on Link from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. For Tekken 7, Lars was given another look by Ninnin. After multiple drafts that gave Lars different colors and accessories, Ninnin made one which retains elements from the Tekken Force design, while adding a torn red cape. For Street Fighter X Tekken, Lars retains his Tekken 6 outfit, but is also given an alternate ninja outfit.|$|E
50|$|Treads {{are often}} {{designed}} to meet specific product marketing positions. High-performance tires have small void ratios to provide more rubber {{in contact with the}} road for higher traction, but may be compounded with <b>softer</b> <b>rubber</b> that provides better traction, but wears quickly. Mud and snow (M&S) tires are designed with higher void ratios to channel away rain and mud, while providing better gripping performance.|$|R
50|$|In general, <b>softer</b> <b>rubber,</b> higher {{hysteresis}} {{rubber and}} stiffer cord configurations increase road holding and improve handling. On most types of poor surfaces, large diameter wheels perform better than lower wider wheels. The depth of tread remaining greatly affects aquaplaning (riding over deep water without reaching the road surface). Increasing tire pressures reduces their slip angle, but lessening the contact area is detrimental in usual surface conditions {{and should be}} used with caution.|$|R
50|$|In some applications, {{there is}} a {{complicated}} set of trade-offs in choosing materials. For example, <b>soft</b> <b>rubbers</b> often provide better traction but also wear faster and have higher losses when flexed—thus reducing efficiency. Choices in material selection may have a dramatic effect. For example: tires used for track racing cars may {{have a life of}} 200 km, while those used on heavy trucks may have a life approaching 100,000 km. The truck tires have less traction and also thicker rubber.|$|R
2500|$|Peanuts are heated by hot air at 280 degrees Fahrenheit (137.3 degrees Celsius) for {{not more}} than 20 minutes in order to soften and split the skins. [...] After that, the peanuts [...] are exposed to {{continuous}} steam in a blanching machine. [...] The skins are then removed using either bristles or <b>soft</b> <b>rubber</b> belts. After that, these skins are separated and blown into waste bags. Meanwhile, the hearts of peanuts are segregated through inspection.|$|E
2500|$|The Spider {{underwent}} a major styling revamp in 1983, which saw {{the introduction of}} black rubber front and rear bumpers. The front bumper incorporated the grille and a small <b>soft</b> <b>rubber</b> spoiler {{was added to the}} trunk lid. The change altered the exterior appearance of the car considerably and was not universally praised by enthusiasts. Various other minor mechanical and aesthetic modifications were also made, and the 1600 car (never available in North America) dropped the [...] "Junior" [...] name.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cornerstone}} of successful periodontal treatment starts with establishing excellent oral hygiene. [...] This includes twice-daily brushing with daily flossing. [...] Also, {{the use of}} an interdental brush is helpful if space between the teeth allows. For smaller spaces, products such as narrow picks with <b>soft</b> <b>rubber</b> bristles provide excellent manual cleaning. [...] Persons with dexterity problems, such as arthritis, may find oral hygiene to be difficult and may require more frequent professional care and/or the use of a powered toothbrush. [...] Persons with periodontitis must realize it is a chronic inflammatory disease and a lifelong regimen of excellent hygiene and professional maintenance care with a dentist/hygienist or periodontist is required to maintain affected teeth.|$|E
50|$|Rain tyres {{are also}} made from <b>softer</b> <b>rubber</b> {{compounds}} {{to help the}} car grip in the slippery conditions and to build up heat in the tyre. These tyres are so soft that running them on a dry track would cause them to deteriorate within minutes. Softer rubber means that the rubber contains more oils and other chemicals which cause a racing tyre to become sticky when it is hot. The softer a tyre, the stickier it becomes, and conversely with hard tyres.|$|R
40|$|The {{modes of}} attachments, {{detachments}} and relaxations of molecules of rubbers and gels on solid surfaces are keys to understanding their frictional properties. An early stochastic model of polymer relaxations on surfaces {{was given by}} Schallamach, which has now evolved in various ways. A review of these developments is presented along with the experimental data that elucidate the kinetic friction of smooth rubber against smooth surfaces. These <b>soft</b> <b>rubbers</b> exhibit various types of instabilities while sliding on surfaces. A few examples of these instabilities are provided...|$|R
40|$|Serpentine {{interconnects}} {{are highly}} stretchable and frequently used in flexible electronic systems. In this work, {{we show that}} the undulating geometry of the serpentine interconnects will generate phononic band gaps to manipulate elastic wave propagation. The interesting effect of `bands-sticking-together' is observed. We further illustrate that the band structures of the serpentine interconnects can be tuned by applying pre-stretch deformation. The discovery offers a way to design stretchable and tunable phononic crystals by using metallic interconnects instead of the conventional design with <b>soft</b> <b>rubbers</b> and unfavorable damping.

2500|$|Keyboard action: Weighted or {{spring-loaded}} keys. The {{least expensive}} home keyboards have no keyboard response, {{and they use}} plastic keys that are mounted on <b>soft</b> <b>rubber</b> or plastic pads. This set-up, called [...] "synthesizer action" [...] is also used in synthesizers. [...] "Weighted response" [...] refers to keys with weights and springs in them, which give a [...] "hammer action" [...] feel similar to an acoustic piano. Most electronic keyboards use spring-loaded keys that make some kinds of playing techniques, such as backhanded sweeps, impossible, but make the keyboards lighter and easier to transport. Players accustomed to standard weighted piano keys may find non-weighted spring-action keyboards uncomfortable and difficult to play effectively. Conversely, keyboard players accustomed to the non-weighted action may encounter difficulty and discomfort playing on a piano with weighted keys.|$|E
2500|$|In late February, over a {{month after}} Donohoe died, Gardaí held a press {{briefing}} at the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) Headquarters in Harcourt Street, Dublin City. There was a renewed appeal for information made, and two replica exhibits of evidence were shown to the media for the first time. A precision panel beating hammer with a black rubber handle, a red painted section and a <b>soft</b> <b>rubber</b> head was found at the scene, and police asked the public for help in tracing its origins. Similar mallets are used by panel beaters or mechanics repairing motorcycles. Also, a distinctive green [...] "Cosatto" [...] high-backed children's car booster seat carrying a [...] "Little Monster" [...] motif {{as well as a}} graphic of a monster was in the car when it was stolen. The child car seat - suitable for babies and young children - cost €119 to buy, and may have been dumped, offered for sale or given as a gift as investigators believe was taken out of the stolen vehicle before it was used in the killing.|$|E
2500|$|The use {{of rubber}} pessaries for {{contraception}} likely {{arose from the}} 19th-century practice of correcting a prolapsed uterus with such a device; the condition {{seems to have been}} far more frequently diagnosed than its incidence would warrant, and at times may have been a fiction for employing a pessary for birth control. As with the production of condoms for men, the development of vulcanized rubber by Charles Goodyear helped make barrier contraceptives for women more reliable and inexpensive. Other terms for the contraceptive diaphragm were [...] "female preventatives", [...] "female protectors", [...] "Victoria's protectors", and the [...] "French pessary" [...] ("F.P.") or pessaire preventif. This linguistic variety, some of it euphemistic, makes it difficult to distinguish in the literature among diaphragms, cervical caps, female condoms, and other pessaries; one form of [...] "womb veil" [...] is described in 1890 as [...] "like a ring pessary covered by a membraneous envelope." [...] Another source in 1895 describes it as [...] "a small <b>soft</b> <b>rubber</b> cup surrounded at the brim by a flexible rubber ring about an inch or inch and a quarter in diameter." ...|$|E

5000|$|Curry or Curry comb: A tool made {{of rubber}} or plastic with short [...] "teeth" [...] on one side, that slides onto {{the hand of}} the groom. It is usually the first tool used in daily grooming. The horse is rubbed or [...] "curried" [...] to help loosen dirt, hair, and other detritus, plus stimulate the skin to produce natural oils. The curry comb is usually used in a {{circular}} motion to work loose embedded material. Curry combs are generally too harsh to be used on the legs or head, though varieties made of <b>softer</b> <b>rubber</b> are available.|$|R
2500|$|The {{crevalle jack}} {{is a popular}} and highly {{regarded}} gamefish throughout its range, with the recreational catch of the species often exceeding commercial catches. The only amateur catch data available are from the US, which has an annual catch of around 400 to 1000 tonnes per year. In Trinidad, the species {{is the basis for}} several fishing tournaments. Crevalle jack are targeted from boats, as well as from piers and rockwalls by land based anglers. Fishermen often target regions where depth suddenly changes, such as channels, holes, reefs or ledges, with strong currents and eddies favourable. The fish take both live and cut baits, as well as a variety of artificial lures; however, when the fish are in feeding mode, they rarely refuse anything they are offered. Popular baits include both live fish, such as mullet and menhaden, as well as dead or strip baits consisting of fish, squid or prawns. Crevalle jack readily accept any style of lure, including hard-bodied spoons, jigs, plugs and poppers, as well as flies and <b>soft</b> <b>rubber</b> lures. There is some evidence based on long term observations that the species favours yellow [...] lures over all others. Tackle is often kept quite light, but heavy monofilament leaders are employed to prevent the fish's teeth from abrading the line. Crevalle jack are generally considered quite poor table fare, with selection of younger fish and bleeding upon capture giving the best results. The flesh is very red and dark due to the red muscle of the fish, which makes it somewhat coarse and poor tasting. When pulled from the water, this fish snorts in what many people describe as [...] "a pig-like" [...] fashion. The crevalle jack has been implicated in several cases of ciguatera poisoning, although appears less likely to be a carrier than the horse-eye jack.|$|E

50|$|However, the {{car that}} made the {{additional}} pit stop will run faster on the race track than cars that {{did not make the}} stop, both because it can carry a smaller amount (and thus lower weight) of fuel, and will also have less wear on its tires, providing more traction and allowing higher speeds in the corners. In racing series where teams have their choice of different compound tyres, the lower tyre wear may be enough to allow the team to choose to use a tyre with a <b>softer</b> <b>rubber</b> compound that provides increased grip at the expense of faster wear; going longer between stops may even cause enough wear on the softer tyre to cause the tyres to fail.|$|R
