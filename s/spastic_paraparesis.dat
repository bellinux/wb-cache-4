Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis</b> and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

50|$|In {{complicated}} {{cases of}} autosomal dominant optic atrophy, {{in addition to}} bilateral optic neuropathy, several other neurological signs of neurological involvement can be observed: peripheral neuropathy, deafness, cerebellar ataxia, <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis,</b> myopathy.|$|E
50|$|The {{prognosis}} for Tropical <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis</b> indicates some improvement in {{a percentage of}} cases due to immunosuppressive treatment. A higher percentage will eventually lose the ability to walk within a ten-year interval.|$|E
50|$|Initially, most {{patients}} experience generalized weakness {{during the first}} days and are bedridden for some days or weeks before trying to walk. Occasional blurred vision and/or speech difficulties typically clear during the first month, except in severely affected patients. Spasticity is present from the first day, without any initial phase of flaccidity. After the initial weeks of functional improvement, the <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis</b> remains stable {{for the rest of}} life. Some patients may suffer an abrupt aggravating episode, e.g. a sudden and permanent worsening of the <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis.</b> Such episodes are identical to the initial onset and can therefore be interpreted as a second onset.|$|E
50|$|In Tropical <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis,</b> HTLV-1 shows {{elevated}} cellular acquired {{immune response}} {{as well as}} high production of proinflammatory cytokines. IFN overexpression has been demonstrated as well. Also the number of NK cells (CD56+ and CD16+) is diminished.|$|E

50|$|Tropical myeloneuropathies are {{classified}} as two separate syndromes: tropical ataxic neuropathy (TAN) and tropical <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis</b> (TSP). They are placed together because they are found in tropical countries, although tropical spastic paraparesishas occurred in temperate countries (e.g., Japan).|$|E
50|$|Treatment of TSP {{involves}} corticosteroids to {{help with}} inflammation. Though any success with corticosteroids is short-lived, with symptoms worsened as the dosage is reduced.

50|$|Mogamulizumab, an anti-CCR4 IgG1 {{monoclonal}} antibody, is {{also being}} researched as a possible treatment for Tropical <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis.</b> The antibody reduces HTLV-1 proviral load and production of proinflammatory cytokines.

A further combination of valproic acid and zidovudine has demonstrated a decrease in proviral loads (in animals).|$|E
50|$|For several decades, {{the term}} {{tropical}} <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis</b> {{was used to}} describe a chronic and progressive clinical syndrome that affected adults living in equatorial areas of the world. This condition was initially thought {{to be associated with}} infectious agents (such as Treponema pertenue and Treponema pallidum, which cause inflammation of the central nervous system) and with chronic nutritional deficiencies (such as avitaminosis) or exposure to potentially toxic foods (such as bitter cassava).|$|E
50|$|The {{severity}} of konzo varies; cases range from only hyperreflexia {{in the lower}} limbs to a severely disabled, bedridden patient with <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis,</b> associated weakness of the trunk and arms, impaired eye movements, speech and possibly visual impairment. Although the severity varies from patient to patient, the longest upper motor neurons are invariably more affected than the shorter ones. Thus, a konzo patient with speech impairment always shows severe symptoms in the legs and arms.|$|E

50|$|Hereditary spastic {{paraplegia}} (HSP) is a {{group of}} inherited diseases whose main feature is a progressive gait disorder. The disease presents with progressive stiffness (spasticity) and contraction in the lower limbs. HSP is also known as hereditary <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis,</b> familial spastic paraplegia, French settlement disease, or Strumpell-Lorrain disease. The symptoms are a result of dysfunction of long axons in the spinal cord. The affected cells are the primary motor neurons, therefore the disease is an upper motor neuron disease. HSP is not a form of cerebral palsy even though it physically may appear and behave much the same as spastic diplegia. The origin of HSP is different from cerebral palsy. Despite this, some of the same anti-spasticity medications used in spastic cerebral palsy are sometimes used to treat HSP symptoms.|$|E
50|$|The human T-{{lymphotropic}} virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus, {{or human}} T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus (HTLV) family of viruses are {{a group of}} human retroviruses that are known to cause a type of cancer called adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and a demyelinating disease called HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis</b> (HAM/TSP). The HTLVs belong to a larger group of primate T-lymphotropic viruses (PTLVs). Members of this family that infect humans are called HTLVs, {{and the ones that}} infect Old World monkeys are called Simian T-lymphotropic viruses (STLVs). To date, four types of HTLVs (human T-lymphotropic virus 1 HTLV-I, human T-lymphotropic virus 2 HTLV-II, HTLV-III, and HTLV-IV) and four types of STLVs (STLV-I, STLV-II, STLV-III, and STLV-V) have been identified. HTLV types HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 viruses are the first retroviruses which were discovered. Both belong to the oncovirus subfamily of retroviruses and can transform human lymphocytes so that they are self-sustaining in vitro. The HTLVs are believed to originate from intraspecies transmission of STLVs. The original name for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was HTLV-III. The HTLV-1 genome is diploid, composed of two copies of a single-stranded RNA virus whose genome is copied into a double-stranded DNA form that integrates into the host cell genome, at which point the virus is referred to as a provirus. A closely related virus is bovine leukemia virus BLV.|$|E
5000|$|Viruses are an {{established}} cause {{of cancer in}} humans and other species. Viral cancers occur only in a minority of infected persons (or animals). Cancer viruses come {{from a range of}} virus families, including both RNA and DNA viruses, and so there is no single type of [...] "oncovirus" [...] (an obsolete term originally used for acutely transforming retroviruses). The development of cancer is determined by a variety of factors such as host immunity and mutations in the host. Viruses accepted to cause human cancers include some genotypes of human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and human T-lymphotropic virus. The most recently discovered human cancer virus is a polyomavirus (Merkel cell polyomavirus) that causes most cases of a rare form of skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma.Hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer. Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis</b> and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are {{an established}} cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein-Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse polyomaviruses that have been used as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years.|$|E

40|$|Mutation of the spastin gene is {{the single}} most common cause of pure {{hereditary}} <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis.</b> In patients with an unexplained sporadic upper motor neuron (UMN) syndrome, clinical distinction between primary lateral sclerosis and sporadic hereditary <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis</b> may be problematic. To investigate whether spastin mutations are present in patients with primary lateral sclerosis and sporadic hereditary <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis,</b> we screened the spastin gene in 99 Dutch patients with an unexplained, apparently sporadic, adult-onset UMN syndrome. We found 6 mutations, of which 4 were novel, in the subgroup of 47 patients with UMN symptoms restricted to the legs (13 %). Another novel spastin mutation was found in a patient with a rapidly progressive spinal and bulbar UMN syndrome that progressed to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the patients with arm or bulbar UMN symptoms and slow progression, no spastin mutations were found. Our study shows that spastin mutations are a frequent cause of apparently sporadic <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis</b> but not of primary lateral sclerosis...|$|E

40|$|We have {{recently}} observed a large pedigree {{with a new}} rare autosomal dominant <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis.</b> In three subsequent generations, 13 affected individuals presented with bilateral cataracts, gastroesophageal reflux with persistent vomiting, and <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis</b> with amyotrophy.

40|$|Introduction: Human T-cell {{lymphotropic}} virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) associated myelopathy/tropical <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis</b> is a chronic progressive neurologic disease {{which might be}} associated by brain and spinal cord atrophy and lesions. Here we systematically reviewed the brain and spinal cord abnormalities reported by using magnetic resonance imaging modality on HTLV- 1 associated myelopathy/tropical <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis</b> patients. Methods: PubMed was searched for all the relevant articles which used magnetic resonance imaging for patients with human HTLV- 1 associated myelopathy/tropical <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis</b> disease. Included criteria were all the cohort and case series on with at least 10 patients. We had no time limitation for searched articles, but only English language articles were included in our systematic review. Exclusion criteria were none-English articles, case reports, articles with less than 10 patients, <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis</b> patients with unknown etiology, and patients with HTLVII. Results: Total of 14 relevant articles were extracted after studying title, abstracts, and full text of the irrelevant articles. Only 2 / 14 articles, reported brain atrophy incidence. 5 / 14 articles studied the brain lesions prevalence. Spinal cord atrophy and lesions, each were studied in 6 / 14 articles. Discussion: According to the extracted data, brain atrophy {{does not seem to}} happen frequently in patients with HTLV- 1 associated myelopathy/tropical <b>spastic</b> <b>paraparesis.</b> None-specific brain lesions identified in articles are indicative of low specificity of magnetic resonance imaging technique despite its high sensitivity. Conclusion: Prevalence of spinal cord lesions and atrophy in these patients might be due to the degenerative processes associated with aging phenomenon. Further larger studies in endemic areas can more accurately reveal the specificity of magnetic resonance imaging for these patients...|$|E
