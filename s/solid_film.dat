[...] Serrano commented on the presentation of Jimmy Wales during the film, [...] "In the end, I came out of the theater thinking of him as a three-dimensional figure, very much a man with passion but neither completely good or evil. To be honest, this is very important in a film like this and is a definite plus for the movie." [...] Serrano recommended the documentary, and concluded, [...] "This is definitely a <b>solid</b> <b>film.</b> ... This film is definitely worth a viewing. It’s interesting, well made, and presents varied perspectives on Wikipedia that help the narrative stay interesting." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>film</b> {{lubricants}} are paint-like coatings of {{very fine}} particles of lubricating pigment blended with a binder and other additives. The lubricant {{is applied to}} a substrate by spray, dip or brush methods and, once cured, creates a <b>solid</b> <b>film</b> which repels water, reduces friction and increases the wear life of the substrate to which it has been applied. Certain film lubricants also offer additional properties such as corrosion inhibition. <b>Solid</b> <b>film</b> lubricants {{are used in the}} automotive, transportation and aerospace industries.

50|$|Paints that dry {{by solvent}} {{evaporation}} and contain the solid binder dissolved in a solvent {{are known as}} lacquers. A <b>solid</b> <b>film</b> forms when the solvent evaporates. Because no chemical crosslinking is involved, the film can re-dissolve in solvent; as such, lacquers are unsuitable for applications where chemical resistance is important. Classic nitrocellulose lacquers fall into this category, as do non-grain raising stains composed of dyes dissolved in solvent. Performance varies by formulation, but lacquers generally tend to have better UV resistance and lower corrosion resistance than comparable systems that cure by polymerization or coalescence.|$|E

5000|$|A {{drying oil}} is an oil that hardens to a tough, <b>solid</b> <b>film</b> {{after a period}} of {{exposure}} to air. The oil hardens through a chemical reaction in which the components crosslink (and hence, polymerize) by the action of oxygen (not through the evaporation of water or other solvents). Drying oils are a key component of oil paint and some varnishes. Some commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, tung oil, poppy seed oil, perilla oil, and walnut oil. Their use has declined over the past several decades, as they have been replaced by alkyd resins and other binders.|$|E

40|$|Thin <b>solid</b> <b>films</b> were {{extensively}} used in {{the making}} of solar cells, cutting tools, magnetic recording devices, etc. As a result, the accurate measurement of mechanical properties of the thin films, such as hardness and elastic modulus, was required. The thickness of thin films normally varies from tens of nanometers to several micrometers. It is thus challenging to measure their mechanical properties. In this study, a nanoscratch method was proposed for hardness measurement. A three-dimensional finite element method (3 -D FEM) model was developed to validate the nanoscratch method and to understand the substrate effect during nanoscratch. Nanoindentation was also used for comparison. The nanoscratch method was demonstrated to be valuable for measuring hardness of thin <b>solid</b> <b>films...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Cast Vinyl is {{the most}} common {{material}} used in color change wraps. A cast vinyl starts as a liquid and is cast into a sheet or form and then processed through ovens, evaporating solvents in the liquid. When the solvents evaporate, the remainder is a <b>solid</b> <b>film</b> usually about 2 thousands of an inch thick. Cast films conform well to curved shapes and strongly retain their original, shape. This durability of shape allows for predictability on application and in applying heat to relax the material back to its natural form after modest stretching. Cast vinyls are less prone to shrinkage because stress (such as extrusion as in calendered films) is not applied to the material during the manufacturing process.|$|E

30|$|A slurry {{of excess}} PbCl 2 in OLA (1 : 2 molar ratio) was {{prepared}} at 100 °C under {{a flow of}} N 2. The temperature was increased to 120 °C for 30  min. At the same time, elemental sulfur was dissolved in OLA (0.1 : 0.2 molar ratio) at 80 °C over 30  min. The sulfur-OLA solution {{was added to the}} PbCl 2 -OLA slurry, and the temperature was raised to the growth temperature of 100 °C and held there for 30  min. The mixture was then removed and quenched by pouring into cold toluene. OA was added to the PbS CQD suspension (20 : 3 volume ratio) at room temperature to exchange the OLA ligands for OA. The suspension was ultrasonicated and then centrifuged to remove the excess PbCl 2. Ethanol was added to the retained supernatant to precipitate the quantum dots. The suspension was centrifuged, the supernatant was discarded, the precipitate was redispersed in toluene, and ethanol was added. The PbS CQDs containing OA ligands were isolated by centrifugation. Treatment with a methanol solution of CTAB was used to exchange OA ligands for the Br- ones in the PbS CQD <b>solid</b> <b>films</b> using layer-by-layer spin coating. A three-step spin coating cycle was used: (1) 50  mg/mL of the PbS CQD solution was spin-coated, (2) 0.5  mL of the CTAB methanol solution was coated onto the PbS CQD <b>solid</b> <b>films,</b> and (3) the films were washed with methanol. Experiments were conducted at room temperature in air and without annealing during the ligand exchange process. This spin coating cycle was repeated seven times. OA-treated PbS CQD <b>solid</b> <b>films,</b> on the other hand, were made by simply spin coating PbS CQDs seven times, without using the other steps. Solution-processed ZnO thin films were spin-coated onto an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate and annealed at 500 °C for 4  h. The two types of PbS CQD <b>solid</b> <b>films</b> were then deposited. Chlorobenzene dispersions of P 3 HT and PCBM were spin-coated onto PbS CQD <b>solid</b> <b>films</b> in an argon-filled glove box and annealed at 120 °C for 10  min.
