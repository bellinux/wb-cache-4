5|$|A 1993 study {{proposed}} that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was {{not the result of}} hunting larger game, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. Compared to modern wolves, the high frequency of tooth fracture in Beringian wolves indicates higher carcass consumption due to higher carnivore density and increased competition.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the fossil remains of large {{carnivores}} from LaBrea pits dated 36,000–10,000YBP shows tooth breakage rates of 5–17% for the dire wolf, coyote, American lion, and Smilodon, compared to 0.5–2.7% for ten modern predators. These higher fracture rates were across all teeth, but the fracture rates for the canine teeth {{were the same as}} in modern carnivores. The dire wolf broke its incisors more often when compared to the modern gray wolf; thus, it has been proposed that the dire wolf used its incisors more closely to the bone when feeding. Dire wolf fossils from Mexico and Peru show a similar pattern of breakage. A 1993 study proposed that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was not the result of hunting larger game, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and thus consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. As their prey became extinct around 10,000 years ago, so did these Pleistocene carnivores, except for the coyote (which is an omnivore).|$|E
500|$|While Project Y continued, Frost had {{meanwhile}} {{become interested}} in the Coandă effect, where fluid flows will follow strongly convex shapes, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> unexpected at first glance. Frost felt the effect could be used with his engine design to produce a more practical VTOL aircraft, the exhaust flowing outward over the upper surface of the aircraft and then being directed downward over a flap-like arrangement. This would produce a lift force around the entire edge of the aircraft, allowing it to land [...] "flat". He produced {{a number of small}} experimental designs using compressed air in place of an engine in order to select a suitable airframe shape, and eventually decided that a disk was the best solution.|$|E

6000|$|I {{was playing}} the part of Richard the Third in a country barn, and Absolutely [...] "out-Heroding Herod." [...] An agent {{of one of the}} great London theatres was present. He was on the lookout for <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> got up as a prodigy. The theatre, it seems, was in desperate condition--nothing but a miracle could save it. He pitched upon me for that miracle. I had a {{remarkable}} bluster in my style, and swagger in my gait, and having taken to drink a little during my troubles, my voice was somewhat cracked; so that it seemed like two voices run into one. The thought struck the agent to bring me out as a theatrical wonder; as the restorer of natural and legitimate acting; as {{the only one who could}} understand and act Shakespeare rightly. He waited upon me the next morning, and opened his plan. I shrunk from it with becoming modesty; for well as I thought of myself, I felt myself unworthy of such praise.|$|E

60|$|He was holding, {{instead of}} a rod, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> a landing-net which some {{fishermen}} use, but which was much more like the ordinary toy net which children carry, and which they generally use indifferently for shrimps or butterflies. He was dipping this into the water at intervals, gravely regarding its harvest of weed or mud, and emptying it out again.|$|R

60|$|But {{was it an}} {{entertainment}} upon a visit? Was Mr. Hastings upon a visit? No: he was executing a commission for the Company in a village {{in the neighborhood of}} Moorshedabad, and by no means upon a visit to the Nabob. On the contrary, he was upon <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> more properly called a visitation. He came as a heavy calamity, like a famine or a pestilence on a country; he came there to do the severest act in the world,--as he himself expresses, to take the bread, literally the bread, from above a thousand of the nobles of the country, and to reduce them to a situation which no man can hear of without shuddering. When you consider, that, while he was thus entertained himself, he was famishing fourteen hundred of the nobility and gentry of the country, you will not conceive it to be any extenuation of his crimes, that he was there, not upon a visit, but upon a duty, the harshest that could be executed, both to the persons who executed and the people who suffered from it.|$|E
60|$|Till he {{had seen}} her his heart had never been struck. Ideas, {{sufficiently}} pleasant in themselves, though tinged with a certain irony and sarcasm, had been frequent with him as to his future career. He would leave that building up of a future family of Marquises,--if future Marquises there were to be,--to one of those young darlings whose bringing-up would manifestly fit them for the work. For himself he would perhaps philosophize, perhaps do <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> of service,--would indulge at any rate his own views as to humanity;--but he would not burden himself with a Countess and a nursery full of young lords and ladies. He had often said to Roden, had often said to Vivian, that her ladyship, his stepmother, need not trouble herself. He certainly would not be guilty of making either a Countess or a Marchioness. They, of course, had laughed at him, and had bid him bide his time. He had bided his time,--as they had said,--and Marion Fay had been the result.|$|E
60|$|Act iii. sc. 1. B. and F. always write as if virtue or {{goodness}} were {{a sort of}} talisman, or strange <b>something,</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> lost {{without the}} least fault {{on the part of}} the owner. In short, their chaste ladies value their chastity as a material thing,—not as an act or state of being; and this mere thing being imaginary, no wonder that all their women are represented with the minds of strumpets, except a few irrational humourists, far less capable of exciting our sympathy than a Hindoo who has had a basin of cow-broth thrown over him;—for this, though a debasing superstition, is still real, and we might pity the poor wretch, though we cannot help despising him. But B. and F.’s Lucinas are clumsy fictions. It is too plain that the authors had no one idea of chastity as a virtue, but only such a conception as a blind man might have of the power of seeing by handling an ox’s eye. In The Queen of Corinth, indeed, they talk differently; but it is all talk, and nothing is real in it but the dread of losing a reputation. Hence the frightful contrast between their women (even those who are meant for virtuous) and Shakespeare’s. So, for instance, The Maid in the Mill:—a woman must not merely have grown old in brothels, but have chuckled over every abomination committed in them with a rampant sympathy of imagination, to have had her fancy so drunk with the minutiæ of lechery as this icy chaste virgin evinces hers to have been.|$|E

6000|$|A [...] "neck," [...] in West Chester and Long Island parlance, means <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> better {{termed a}} [...] "head and shoulders," [...] if mere shape and {{dimensions}} are kept in view. Peninsula would be the true word, were we describing things on a geographical scale; but, as they are, I {{find it necessary to}} adhere to the local term, which is not altogether peculiar to our county, by the way. The [...] "neck" [...] or peninsula of Satanstoe, contains just four hundred and sixty-three acres and a half of excellent West Chester land; and that, when the stone is hauled and laid into wall, is saying as much in its favour as need be said of any soil on earth. It has two miles of beach, and collects a proportionate quantity of sea-weed for manure, besides enjoying near a hundred acres of salt-meadow and sedges, that are not included in the solid ground of the neck proper. As my father, Major Evans Littlepage, was to inherit this estate from his father, Capt. Hugh Littlepage, it might, even at the time of my birth, be considered old family property, it having indeed, been acquired by my grandfather, through his wife, about thirty years after the final cession of the colony to the English by its original Dutch owners. Here we had lived, then, near half a century, when I was born, in the direct line, and considerably longer if we included maternal ancestors; here I now live, at the moment of writing these lines, and here I trust my only son is to live after me.|$|E
60|$|I exulted to have Thackeray {{attack the}} aristocrats, and expose their wicked pride and meanness, and I never {{noticed that he}} did not propose to do away with aristocracy, which is and must always be just what it has been, and which cannot be changed while it exists at all. He {{appeared}} to me one of the noblest creatures that ever was when he derided the shams of society; and I was far from seeing that society, as we have it, was necessarily a sham; when he made a mock of snobbishness I did not know but snobbishness was <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> reached and cured by ridicule. Now I know that so long as we have social inequality we shall have snobs; we shall have men who bully and truckle, and women who snub and crawl. I know that it is futile to, spurn them, or lash them for trying to get on in the world, and that the world is what it must be from the selfish motives which underlie our economic life. But I did not know these things then, nor for long afterwards, and so I gave my heart to Thackeray, who seemed to promise me in his contempt of the world a refuge from the shame I felt for my own want of figure in it. He had the effect of taking me into the great world, and making me a party to his splendid indifference to titles, and even to royalties; and I could not see that sham for sham he was unwittingly the greatest sham of all.|$|E
60|$|I {{found him}} that day I speak of {{in his house}} at Beverly Farms, where he had a {{pleasant}} study in a corner by the porch, and he met me with all the cheeriness of old. But he confessed {{that he had been}} greatly broken up by the labor of preparing <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> read at some commemorative meeting, and had suffered from finding first that he could not write something specially for it. Even the copying and adapting an old poem had overtaxed him, and in this he showed the failing powers of age. But otherwise he was still young, intellectually; that is, there was no failure of interest in intellectual things, especially literary things. Some new book lay on the table at his elbow, and he asked me if I had seen it, and made some joke about his having had the good luck to read it, and have it lying by him a few days before when the author called. I do not know whether he schooled himself against an old man's tendency to revert to the past or not, but I know that he seldom did so. That morning, however, he made several excursions into it, and told me that his youthful satire of the 'Spectre Pig' had been provoked by a poem of the elder Dana's, where a phantom horse had been seriously employed, with an effect of anticlimax which he had found irresistible. Another foray was to recall the oppression and depression of his early religious associations, and to speak with moving tenderness of his father, whose hard doctrine as a minister was without effect upon his own kindly nature.|$|E
