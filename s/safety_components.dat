25|$|The {{expense of}} Formula One {{has seen the}} FIA and the Formula One Commission attempt to create new {{regulations}} to lower the costs for a team {{to compete in the}} sport. Cost-saving proposals have included allowing customer cars, either by teams purchasing a car from another constructor, or the series supplying a basic chassis and engine to some teams at a low cost. Allowing teams to share more car components such as the monocoque and <b>safety</b> <b>components</b> is also under consideration. The FIA also continually researches new ways to increase safety in the sport, which includes introducing new regulations and accident procedures.|$|E
2500|$|In 1956 DuPont {{introduced}} polyether polyols, specifically poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol, and BASF and Dow Chemical {{started selling}} polyalkylene glycols in 1957. Polyether polyols were cheaper, easier to handle and more water-resistant than polyester polyols, and became more popular. Union Carbide and Mobay, a U.S. Monsanto/Bayer joint venture, also began making polyurethane chemicals. In 1960 more than 45,000 {{metric tons of}} flexible polyurethane foams were produced. The availability of chlorofluoroalkane blowing agents, inexpensive polyether polyols, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) allowed [...] polyurethane rigid foams {{to be used as}} high-performance insulation materials. In 1967, urethane-modified polyisocyanurate rigid foams were introduced, offering even better thermal stability and flammability resistance. During the 1960s, automotive interior <b>safety</b> <b>components,</b> such as instrument and door panels, were produced by back-filling thermoplastic skins with semi-rigid foam.|$|E

5000|$|A reactor design whose {{inherently}} safe process directly provides a passive <b>safety</b> <b>component</b> during a specific failure condition in all operational modes is typically described as relatively fail-safe to that failure condition. [...] However most current water-cooled and -moderated reactors, when scrammed, can not remove residual production and decay heat without either process heat transfer or the active cooling system. In other words, whilst the {{inherently safe}} heat transfer process provides a passive <b>safety</b> <b>component</b> preventing excessive heat while the reactor is operating, the same inherently safe heat transfer process {{does not provide}} a passive <b>safety</b> <b>component</b> if the reactor is shut down (SCRAMed). The Three Mile Island accident exposed this design deficiency: the reactor and steam generator were shut down but with loss of coolant it still suffered a partial meltdown.|$|R

50|$|The {{pebble bed}} reactor {{is an example}} of a reactor exhibiting an {{inherently}} safe process that is also capable of providing a passive <b>safety</b> <b>component</b> for all operational modes. As the temperature of the fuel rises, Doppler broadening increases the probability that neutrons are captured by U-238 atoms. This reduces the chance that the neutrons are captured by U-235 atoms and initiate fission, thus reducing the reactor's power output and placing an inherent upper limit on the temperature of the fuel. The geometry and design of the fuel pebbles provides an important passive <b>safety</b> <b>component.</b>|$|R

50|$|Single fluid {{fluoride}} {{molten salt}} reactors feature fissile, fertile and actinide radioisotopes in molecular bonds with the fluoride coolant. The molecular bonds provide a passive safety feature in that a loss-of-coolant event corresponds with a loss-of-fuel event.

The higher density of the fuel along with additional lower density FLiBe fluoride coolant without fuel provides a flotation layer passive <b>safety</b> <b>component</b> in which lower density graphite that breaks off control rods or an immersion matrix during mechanical failure does not induce criticality.

50|$|From {{the time}} it was built one shaft was {{specifically}} used by the British Standards Institution (BSI) for type testing of lift <b>safety</b> <b>components</b> at the time under the BS5655 and BS EN81 standards. Safety Gear testing involved putting the lift cars (frame) into free fall conditions with rated mass at tripping speeds as required by the designers of the safety gear to ensure the lift cars decelerated and stopped within the requirements of the standard. Buffer testing involved impacting them with the maximum and minimum mass at tripping speeds to ensure decelerations were within that requirement by the standard in both cases the aim was to ensure if the lift ever went into free fall or uncontrolled downward movement the <b>safety</b> <b>components</b> stopped the lift without causing any serious injury to the occupant.
