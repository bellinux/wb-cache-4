40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) {{composites}} have gradually gained wide acceptance in civil engineering applications due to their unique advantages including their high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance. In particular, many possibilities of using FRP in the strengthening and construction of concrete structures have been explored. More recently, the use of FRP to strengthen existing <b>steel</b> <b>structures</b> has received much attention. This paper starts with a critical discussion {{of the use of}} FRP in the strengthening of <b>steel</b> <b>structures</b> where the advantages of FRP are appropriately exploited. The paper then provides a critical review and interpretation of existing research on FRP-strengthened <b>steel</b> <b>structures.</b> Topics covered by the review include steel surface preparation for adhesive bonding, selection of a suitable adhesive, bond behavior between FRP and steel and its appropriate modeling, flexural strengthening of steel beams, fatigue strengthening of <b>steel</b> <b>structures,</b> strengthening of thin-walled <b>steel</b> <b>structures</b> against local buckling, and strengthening of hollow or concrete-filled steel tubes through external FRP confinement. The paper concludes with comments on future research needs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|The {{artificial}} ice {{increased the}} popularity of playing ice hockey in the neighborhood. The club therefore started working on plans to build an indoor ice rink over the artificial rink. Planning of the hall started in 1989, and in 1990 {{a proposal for a}} <b>steel</b> <b>structure</b> was launched. However, it was rejected by the municipality. The club therefore hired Einar Dahle Arkitekter to work on a new design, resulting in area planning regulations being passed in 1991. Financing of the <b>steel</b> <b>structure</b> had been secured in loans, but these were stopped following a credit crunch. In 1994, the municipality initiated a redevelopment program of the downtown residential areas, which included grants to build Gr√ºnerhallen. The hall was estimated to cost NOK23.4 million and the contract was awarded to Mur 6 Tax. Construction started in March 1995 and the venue opened on 6 October 1995, as the 30th indoor ice rink in Norway. In 1996, the city council had to grant an additional NOK4.6 million to cover cost overruns.|$|E
