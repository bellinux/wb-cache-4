60|$|Injuries to Guns, to repair.--Ramrod tubes often break off, {{and it is}} a very {{troublesome}} accident {{when they}} do so. I know of no contrivance to fasten them on again, except by using <b>soft</b> <b>solder,</b> the application of which will not in the least hurt the gun: ashes, at a dull red heat, must be heaped over the barrel to warm it sufficiently, before applying the solder. If the ramrod tubes have been lost, others made of tin may replace them.|$|E

50|$|The {{corrosion}} resistance of CuproBraze is generally better than <b>soft</b> <b>soldered</b> heat exchangers. This {{is because the}} materials in CuproBraze heat exchangers are of equal nobility, so galvanic differences are minimized. On <b>soft</b> <b>soldered</b> heat exchangers, the solder is less noble than fin and tube materials and can suffer from galvanic attack in corrosive environments.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the issues}} with the CSP type of package (which was {{intended}} to be soldered directly to an FR4 or flex circuit) was that for high-density interconnects, the <b>soft</b> <b>solder</b> bump provided less of a stand-off as the solder bump diameter and pitch were decreased. Different solutions were employed including one developed by Focus Interconnect Technology (former APTOS engineers), which used a high aspect ratio plated copper post to provide a larger fixed standoff than was possible for a <b>soft</b> <b>solder</b> collapse joint.|$|E
50|$|Different {{equipment}} is usually required since {{a soldering iron}} cannot achieve high enough temperatures for hard soldering or brazing. Brazing filler metal is stronger than silver solder, which is stronger than lead-based <b>soft</b> <b>solder.</b> Brazing solders are formulated primarily for strength, silver solder is used by jewelers to protect the precious metal and by machinists and refrigeration technicians for its tensile strength but lower melting temperature than brazing, and the primary benefit of <b>soft</b> <b>solder</b> is the low temperature used (to prevent heat damage to electronic components and insulation).|$|E
50|$|CuproBraze can {{be easily}} repaired. This {{advantage}} of the technology is especially important in remote areas where spare parts may be limited. CuproBraze can be repaired with lead-free <b>soft</b> <b>solder</b> (for example 97% tin, 3% copper) or with common silver-containing brazing alloys.|$|E
40|$|For an {{electrically}} conductive joining of surface assembled components on substrates besides <b>soft</b> <b>solders</b> metal filled adhesives {{are used to}} an increasing extent. These adhesives mainly are based on epoxide resins and are filled with silver flakes of approx. 70 - 80 wt. %. The dimensions of the silver flakes are in the mym-range. Thereby a specific electrical resistance of approx. 10 high - 4 Ohm cm can be achieved which is tenfold that of <b>soft</b> <b>solders</b> but acceptable f or technical application. In no case the 36 -hours PC-test led to an adhesional failure of the adhesive joints. However the test occasionally caused a functional failure of the components because of excessive total resistance {{which could not be}} explained by the resistance of the chips...|$|R
50|$|Fluxes for <b>soft</b> <b>soldering</b> are {{typically}} of organic nature, though inorganic fluxes, usually based on halogenides and/or acids, {{are also used}} in non-electronics applications. Fluxes for brazing operate at significantly higher temperatures and are therefore mostly inorganic; the organic compounds tend to be of supplementary nature.|$|R
50|$|The {{distinction}} between soldering and brazing {{is based on}} the melting temperature of the filler alloy. A temperature of 450 °C is usually used as a practical demarcation between <b>soldering</b> and brazing. <b>Soft</b> <b>soldering</b> can be done with a heated iron whereas the other methods typically require a higher temperature torch or a furnace to melt the filler metal.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{flip chip}} {{is a well}} {{established}} technology and collapsed <b>soft</b> <b>solder</b> connections {{are used in the}} vast majority of assemblies. Interestingly, the copper post stand-off developed for the CSP market has found a home in high-density interconnects for advanced micro-processors and is used today by IBM for its CPU packaging.|$|E
50|$|Soft {{soldering}} {{is characterized}} by having a melting point of the filler metal below approximately , whereas silver soldering and brazing use higher temperatures, typically requiring a flame or carbon arc torch to achieve the melting of the filler. <b>Soft</b> <b>solder</b> filler metals are typically alloys (often containing lead) that have liquidus temperatures below 350 °C.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>solder</b> {{typically}} has {{a melting}} point range of 90 to 450 C, and {{is commonly used}} in electronics, plumbing, and sheet metal work. Manual soldering uses a soldering iron or soldering gun. Alloys that melt between 180 and 190 C are the most commonly used. Soldering performed using alloys with a melting point above 450 C is called [...] "hard soldering", [...] "silver soldering", or brazing.|$|E
5000|$|... "Soft zinc" [...] is a newer, {{proprietary}} flashing material. It is {{a relatively}} malleable material, making it useful for complex roofing connections. It provides normal <b>soft</b> <b>soldering</b> capabilities and delivers easy folding. Soft zinc {{is said to be}} an [...] "environmentally friendly" [...] replacement for lead flashing; like lead, it is recyclable, while avoiding lead-contaminated runoff.|$|R
5000|$|Each solder alloy has {{characteristics}} that {{work best for}} certain applications, notably strength and conductivity, and each type of solder and alloy has different melting temperatures. The term silver solder denotes the type of solder that is used. Some <b>soft</b> <b>solders</b> are [...] "silver-bearing" [...] alloys used to solder silver-plated items. Lead-based solders {{should not be used}} on precious metals because the lead dissolves the metal and disfigures it.|$|R
5000|$|Soldering and brazing {{processes}} rely on {{a filler}} metal added to the joint to form the junction between the base metal parts. <b>Soft</b> <b>soldering</b> uses a filler that melts at a lower temperature than the workpiece, often a lead-tin solder alloy. Brazing and hard soldering use a higher temperature filler that melts at a temperature which may approach that of the base metal, and which may form a eutectic alloy with the base metal.|$|R
50|$|Each type of solder offers {{advantages}} and disadvantages. <b>Soft</b> <b>solder</b> is so called {{because of the}} soft lead that is its primary ingredient. Soft soldering uses the lowest temperatures (and so thermally stresses components the least) but {{does not make a}} strong joint and is unsuitable for mechanical load-bearing applications. It is also unsuitable for high-temperature applications as it loses strength, and eventually melts. Silver soldering, as used by jewelers, machinists and in some plumbing applications, requires the use of a torch or other high-temperature source, and is much stronger than soft soldering. Brazing provides the strongest of the non-welded joints but also requires the hottest temperatures to melt the filler metal, requiring a torch or other high temperature source and darkened goggles to protect the eyes from the bright light produced by the white-hot work. It is often used to repair cast-iron objects, wrought-iron furniture, etc.|$|E
50|$|Many {{problems}} {{attended the}} successful {{development of a}} lamp {{that could be a}} commercial success. Argand experimented with all of them, searching for practical compromises. The design manufacture of the wick was solved by a lacemaker. The type of glass to use next to the hot flame was a problem eventually solved. All available types of oil to use were tested, and methods to purify them for use were the subject of a number of experiments. Whale oil was eventually settled on, which eventually created an important new industry. The mechanism for holding the wick and moving it up and down went through many variations. Even the solder used to fabricate the oil reservoir was a problem when it was discovered that the <b>soft</b> <b>solder</b> joints leaked. The invention of the lamp did not consist, then, of only one invention, but rather of the improvement and development of a complete system of parts all working together, not unlike Edison's invention of the electrical lighting system that was to again revolutionize lighting over a century later.|$|E

40|$|The {{electrical}} interconnection of Nb 3 Sn/Cu strands is a {{key issue}} {{for the construction of}} Nb 3 Sn based damping ring wigglers and insertion devices for third generation light sources. We compare the electrical resistance of Nb 3 Sn/Cu splices manufactured by solid state welding using Electromagnetic Pulse Technology (EMPT) with that of splices produced by <b>soft</b> <b>soldering</b> with two different solders. The resistance of splices produced by <b>soft</b> <b>soldering</b> depends strongly on the resistivity of the solder alloy at the operating temperature. By solid state welding splice resistances below 10 nOhm can be achieved with 1 cm strand overlap length only, which is about 4 times lower than the resistance of Sn 96 Ag 4 soldered splices with the same overlap length. The comparison of experimental results with Finite Element simulations shows that the electrical resistance of EMPT welded splices is determined by the resistance of the stabilizing copper between the superconducting filaments and confirms that welding of the strand matrix is indeed achieved. EMPT allows interconnecting the ductile, unreacted strands, which reduces the risk of damaging the brittle reacted Nb 3 Sn strands...|$|R

As basic materials steel sheet, zinc-coated steel sheet, copper sheet and brass sheet 100 x 20 x 1 [*]mm was the test samples size. Always two sheets were cleaned and jointed together. For heating the propane-butane + air flame was used. Then the tested assemblies were loaded using the universal tensile-strength testing machine till to failure. At the tests the force needed for assemblies failure and failure type (in soldered joint, in basic material) were recorded. From measured data the solder strength was calculated. From the experiment results {{it follows that}} {{from the point of}} view of the soldered joints strength as well of the solder strength relatively small differences were found. At the same time it is evident that the joint strength and solder strength depend on soldered material type and on soldered joint lapping length. On the basis of carried out experiments it can be stated that the substitution of lead solders by leadless solders is possible without risk of soldered joints strength decrease...|$|R

50|$|Brazing (sometimes {{known as}} silver {{soldering}} or hard soldering) requires {{a much higher}} temperature than <b>soft</b> <b>soldering,</b> sometimes over 850 °C. As well as removing existing oxides, rapid oxidation of the metal at the elevated temperatures has to be avoided. This means that fluxes {{need to be more}} aggressive and to provide a physical barrier. Traditionally borax was used as a flux for brazing, but there are now many different fluxes available, often using active chemicals such as fluorides as well as wetting agents. Many of these chemicals are toxic and due care should be taken during their use.|$|R

"Rust Bluing" [...] and [...] "Fume Bluing" [...] {{provide the}} best rust and {{corrosion}} resistance as the process continually converts any metal {{that is capable of}} rusting into magnetite (Fe3O4). Treating with an oiled coating enhances the protection offered by the bluing. This process is also the only process safely used to re-blue vintage shotguns. Many double barrelled shotguns are <b>soft</b> <b>soldered</b> (Lead) / silver brazed together and many of the parts are attached by that method also.

40|$|Purpose - Because of {{the need}} for {{electronics}} use at temperatures beyond 150 C, high temperature resistant interconnection technologies like transient liquid phase (TLP) soldering and silver sintering are being developed which are not only replacements of high-lead solders, but also open new opportunities in terms of temperature resistance and reliability. The paper aims to address the thermo-mechanical reliability issues that have to be considered if the new interconnection technologies will be applied. Design/methodology/approach - A TLP soldering technique is briefly introduced and new challenges concerning the thermo-mechanical reliability of power devices are worked out by numerical analysis (finite element simulation). They arise as the material properties of the interconnect materials differ substantially from those known for <b>soft</b> <b>solders.</b> The effective material responses of the new materials are determined by localized unit cell models that capture the inhomogeneous structure of the materials. Findings - It is shown that both the TLP solder layer and the Ag-sinter layer have much less ductility and show less creep than conventional <b>soft</b> <b>solders.</b> The potential failure modes of an assembly made by TLP soldering or Ag sintering change. In particular, the characteristic low cycle fatigue solder failures become unlikely and are replaced either by metallization fatigue, brittle failure of intermetallic compound, components, or interfaces. Originality/value - A variety of new failure risks, which have been analyzed theoretically, can be avoided only if they are known to the potential user of the new techniques. It is shown that an optimal reliability will be strongly dependent on the actual assembly design...|$|R
