50|$|The antenna {{used on the}} ASR-9 was a {{state of}} the art horned <b>shaped</b> <b>reflector</b> that forms two cosecant-squared beams to allow high {{elevation}} gain, as well as coverage up to forty-two degrees in elevation coverage. The two beams that pulse from the ASR-9 are nearly identical; however, a minimal displacement in height between the two beams causes a coverage change of approximately four degrees elevation. The upper beam on the ASR-9 is used primarily for short range reception, while the lower beam was mainly used for transmitting as well as long range reception. A combination of beam displacement, as well as a sharp underside cut off,  gave the ASR-9 a technological advantage when compared to previously installed ASR systems; the radar systems before the ASR-9 {{had not been able to}} reject ground clutter when transmitting with the upper beam.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} the <b>shaped</b> <b>reflector</b> antenna by using backscattering technique {{to achieve the}} completely broad-beam radiation pattern. The radiation synthesis method for <b>shaped</b> <b>reflector</b> that has to illuminate a predefined circular area are presented by {{using a variety of}} discretization of elementary geometrical functions such as, triangular, quadratic, circular, guassian, cosine, squared cosine, parabolic and hyperbolic distributions. The antenna characteristics i. e., maximum ripple level, maximum gain, and half-power beamwidth (HPBW) of the variety of shaped reflectors are analytically determined by using physical optics (PO). These shapes reflector will be discussed on merit and demerit to choose for utilization in wireless local area network (wireless LAN). The reflector which has appropriate characteristics for indoor wireless LAN in very large room will be analyzed detail by introducing the fringe wave (FW) in physical theory of diffraction (PTD).

40|$|Ultraviolet (UVR) {{phototherapy}} {{is widely}} used to treat an array of skin conditions, including psoriasis, eczema and vitiligo. For such interventions, a quantified dose is vital if the treatment is to be both biologically effective and to avoid the detrimental effects of over-dosing. As dose is absorbed at surface level, the orientation of patient site {{with respect to the}} UVR lamps modulates effective dose. Previous investigations have modelled this behaviour, and examined the impact of <b>shaped</b> anodized aluminium <b>reflectors</b> typically placed around lamps in phototherapy cabins. These mirrors are effective but tend to yield complex patterns of reflection around the cabin which can result in substantial dose inhomogeneity. There has been some speculation over whether using the reflective property of parabolic mirrors might improve dose delivery or homogeneity through the treatment cabin. In this work, the effects of parabolic mirrors are simulated and compared with standard shaped mirrors. Simulation results strongly suggest that parabolic reflectors reduce total irradiance relative to standard <b>shaped</b> <b>reflectors,</b> and have a negligible impact on dose homogeneity...|$|R

40|$|Circularly symmetric, dual reflector, {{high gain}} antenna systems often require feeds placed off the system's axis {{because of the}} need for {{multiple}} feeds to use the reflector antenna. Also, the constraint requiring the hyperboloid or shaped subreflector to remain circularly symmetric is sometimes added. In a Cassegrainian system, the subreflector and feed may be rotated off axis around the paraboloid focus and retain main reflector focusing. However, substantial spillover results in considerable noise with a high gain/low noise temperature system. In a shaped system, the tilt of the shaped subreflector and feed together results in substantial defocusing as well as spillover noise. If the subreflector is tilted approximately one-half the angle of the feed tilt in either the Casegrainian or the dual <b>shaped</b> <b>reflector</b> antenna, it is found that spillover and noise are substantially reduced with tolerable defocusing. An extensive numerical analysis of these effects was conducted to determine the characteristics of a planned 70 -meter, dual <b>shaped</b> <b>reflector</b> versus Cassegrainian antenna and to gain some understanding of the cause of the observed effects...|$|E
