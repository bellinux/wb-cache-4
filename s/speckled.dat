5|$|Most {{fish species}} in Johnson Creek {{tolerate}} {{warm water and}} disturbed conditions. These include red-sided shiners, sculpin, suckers, and <b>speckled</b> dace.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{accepted}} coat colours, red and blue, though {{chocolate and}} cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue <b>speckled</b> {{with or without}} black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly <b>speckled</b> with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration {{is the result of}} black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a <b>speckled</b> effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.|$|E
5|$|Native fish in Fossil Creek include {{headwater}} chub, roundtail chub, <b>speckled</b> dace, longfin dace, Sonora sucker, {{and desert}} sucker. Between 2007 and 2010, the Arizona Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service added native spikedace, loach minnows, Gila topminnows, and razorback suckers {{as well as}} more longfin dace above the barrier. All except <b>speckled</b> dace are special-status fish listed as endangered, threatened, or sensitive by federal or state agencies. In addition, more than 100 macroinvertebrate species live in the Fossil Creek watershed. One, the fossil springsnail, is listed sensitive by the U.S. Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|The Russian Spaniel is a small, sturdy {{dog with}} a short, tight, silky coat with {{feathering}} on the ears and legs. Colors can vary greatly, and can include solid colors without white markings, piebald, <b>speckled,</b> black and tan, and combinations. The head and ears are also usually dark.|$|E
5|$|Eurasian rock pipits {{construct}} a cup nest under coastal vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay {{four to six}} <b>speckled</b> pale grey eggs which hatch in about two weeks with a further 16days to fledging. Although insects are occasionally caught in flight, the pipits feed mainly on small invertebrates picked off the rocks or from shallow water.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales of}} Solomon Islands skinks are {{a dark green}} but are often <b>speckled</b> with light brown or black. The scales on the {{underside}} vary from light yellow to different shades of green. The toes on all four legs have thick, curved nails used for climbing and gripping tree limbs.|$|E
5|$|Water pipits {{construct}} a cup-like nest {{on the ground}} under vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay four to six <b>speckled</b> grey-ish white eggs, which hatch in about two weeks with a further 14–15days to fledging. Although pipits occasionally catch insects in flight, they feed mainly on small invertebrates picked off the ground or vegetation, and also some plant material.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{accounts}} of ancient breeds of piebald sheep {{is the story}} of Jacob from the first book of the Hebrew Bible, called by Christians the Old Testament. According to the Book of Genesis (Genesis 30:3143), Jacob took every <b>speckled</b> and spotted sheep from his father-in-law's (Laban's) flock and bred them. Due to the resemblance to the animal described in Genesis, the Jacob sheep was named for the Biblical figure of Jacob sometime in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, with one eye migrating {{to the other side of}} the head, and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually <b>speckled</b> and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{are white}} to cream on their ventral (belly) surfaces. Their backs and flanks are usually yellowish-green to green, overlain with heavy darker green, but {{occasionally}} brown or black, mottling. The {{effect is a}} marbled appearance sometimes reminiscent of a leopard's markings. Colouration is related to water clarity; colouration is intense in fish from clear water habitats. Small to medium-sized Murray cod from clear-water habitats often have striking and very distinct colouration. Very large fish tend towards a <b>speckled</b> grey-green colouration.|$|E
5|$|Only nine quagga {{catshark}} specimens {{have been}} recorded. In addition to Alcock's type specimen, four males were trawled from off the eastern Somalian coast {{by the research}} ship RV Anton Bruun in 1964. Four more individuals, two male and two female, were found amongst the contents of commercial fishing trawls conducted off Quilon, India in 2010. A male specimen reported from the Gulf of Aden in 1939 was later re-identified as a <b>speckled</b> catshark (H. boesemani).|$|E
5|$|The black honeyeater (Sugomel nigrum) is {{a species}} of bird in the honeyeater family Meliphagidae, and the sole species in the genus Sugomel. The black honeyeater {{exhibits}} sexual dimorphism, with the male being black and white while the female is a <b>speckled</b> grey-brown; immature birds look like the female. The species is endemic to Australia, and ranges widely across the arid areas of the continent, through open woodland and shrubland, particularly {{in areas where the}} emu bush and related species occur.|$|E
5|$|The larger scutes {{display a}} pattern of black or yellow lines. The wood turtle's {{plastron}} (ventral shell) is yellowish in color and has dark patches. The posterior margin of the plastron terminates in a V-shaped notch. Although sometimes <b>speckled</b> with yellowish spots, the upper surface of the head is often a dark gray to solid black. The ventral surfaces of the neck, chin, and legs are orange to red with faint yellow stripes along the lower jaw of some individuals. Seasonal variation in color vibrancy {{have been known to}} occur.|$|E
5|$|The skin of E. rabborum was {{granular}} in {{texture and}} predominantly a mottled brown. The upper {{surfaces of the}} limbs was also mottled brown while the rear surfaces of the thighs were a pale yellow. The chin and upper chest was distinctively brown, though {{the rest of the}} underside of the body was mostly white <b>speckled</b> with irregular brown spots. The eyelids and upper surfaces of the limbs and back were studded with green flecks, the appearance and positions of which could be changed by the animal voluntarily (metachrosis). The irises of the eyes was uniformly reddish brown.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{tree species}} have been {{observed}} near Lake Chillisquaque. These include two oak species, two maple spaces, red elm, boxelder, shagbark hickory, black tupelo, American basswood, eastern hop-hornbeam, black ash, and musclewood. Ten shrub species also grow near the lake. These include three dogwood species, two holly species, multiflora rose, Morrow's honeysuckle, <b>speckled</b> alder, spicebush, and mayberry. Eighteen species of herbs live on the lake, as well. Five of these species are sedges. Cattails and beds of grass grow along the shores of Lake Chillisquaque. Additionally, a sizable population of Rotala ramosior grows on the lake.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and <b>speckled</b> with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both {{the male and}} female will feed the chicks.|$|E
5|$|Caddisflies {{are called}} sedges by anglers. Individual species emerge en masse at {{different}} times, {{and are used}} one after the other, often {{for only a few}} days each year, as models for artificial fishing flies for fly fishing in trout streams. A mass emergence is known as a hatch. Each type has its own angling name, so for example Mystacides is the dancer; Sericostoma the caperer; Leptocerus the silverhorn; Phryganea the murragh or great red sedge; Brachycentrus subnubilis the grannom; Lepidostoma the silver sedge; Oecetis the longhorn sedge; Cheumatopsyche the little sister sedge; Helicopsyche the <b>speckled</b> Peter, an important fishing fly in North America; and Hydropsyche the specked sedge, perhaps the most important caddisfly genus for anglers with over 50 species of net-makers.|$|E
5|$|Guinea fowl {{originated}} in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). It is a medium-sized grey or <b>speckled</b> bird {{with a small}} naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top, and was domesticated {{by the time of}} the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.|$|E
5|$|In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in {{the music}} (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the {{conductor}} in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he {{said that he did}} not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie ("Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple ("gold and brown") to the highly detailed ("blue-violet rocks, <b>speckled</b> with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant").|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is a habitat generalist {{as it is}} {{associated}} with tidal marshes and present throughout the year in salt marshes from the Gulf of Maine to coastal Virginia. It usually prefers freshwater and coastal wetlands throughout northeastern America, including brackish marshes, estuaries and edges of backwater ponds and rivers lined by <b>speckled</b> alder. It also inhabits beaver ponds, shallow lakes with sedges and reeds, bogs in open boreal and mixed hardwood forests, as well as forested swamps. Populations in Vermont have also been found in glacial kettle ponds surrounded by bog mats. During winter, the American black duck mostly inhabits brackish marshes bordering bays, agricultural marshes, flooded timber, agricultural fields, estuaries and riverine areas. Ducks usually take shelter from hunting and other disturbances by moving to brackish and fresh impoundments on conservation land.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} of the nominate subspecies T. m. merula is 23.5 to 29centimetres (9.25 to 11.4in) in length, {{has a long}} tail, {{and weighs}} 80–125grams (2.8 to 4.4oz). The adult male has glossy black plumage, blackish-brown legs, a yellow eye-ring and an orange-yellow bill. The bill darkens somewhat in winter. The adult female is sooty-brown with a dull yellowish-brownish bill, a brownish-white throat and some weak mottling on the breast. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, but has pale spots on the upperparts, and the very young juvenile also has a <b>speckled</b> breast. Young birds vary in the shade of brown, with darker birds presumably males. The first year male resembles the adult male, but has a dark bill and weaker eye ring, and its folded wing is brown, rather than black like the body plumage.|$|E
5|$|Some animals, {{such as the}} horned lizards of North America, {{have evolved}} {{elaborate}} measures to eliminate shadow. Their bodies are flattened, with the sides thinning to an edge; the animals habitually press their bodies to the ground; and their sides are fringed with white scales which effectively hide and disrupt any remaining areas of shadow there may be under {{the edge of the}} body. The theory that the body shape of the horned lizards which live in open desert is adapted to minimise shadow is supported by the one species which lacks fringe scales, the roundtail horned lizard, which lives in rocky areas and resembles a rock. When this species is threatened, it makes itself look as much like a rock as possible by curving its back, emphasizing its three-dimensional shape. Some species of butterflies, such as the <b>speckled</b> wood, Pararge aegeria, minimise their shadows when perched by closing the wings over their backs, aligning their bodies with the sun, and tilting to one side towards the sun, so that the shadow becomes a thin inconspicuous line rather than a broad patch. Similarly, some ground-nesting birds including the European nightjar select a resting position facing the sun. The elimination of shadow was identified as a principle of military camouflage during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Some {{variation}} {{is seen in}} the 12 subspecies of house sparrows, which are divided into two groups, the Oriental P. d. indicus group, and the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group. Birds of the P. d. domesticus group have grey cheeks, while P. d. indicus group birds have white cheeks, as well as bright colouration on the crown, a smaller bill, and a longer black bib. The subspecies P. d. tingitanus differs little from the nominate subspecies, except in the worn breeding plumage of the male, in which the head is <b>speckled</b> with black and underparts are paler. P. d. balearoibericus is slightly paler than the nominate, but darker than P. d. bibilicus. P. d. bibilicus is paler than most subspecies, but has the grey cheeks of P. d. domesticus group birds. The similar P. d. persicus is paler and smaller, and P. d. niloticus is nearly identical but smaller. Of the less widespread P. d. indicus group subspecies, P. d. hyrcanus is larger than P. d. indicus, P. d. hufufae is paler, P. d. bactrianus is larger and paler, and P. d. parkini is larger and darker with more black on the breast than any other subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} {{spots of}} the spotted green pigeon {{are not unique}} among pigeons, but are also seen in the spot-winged pigeon (Columba maculosa) and the <b>speckled</b> pigeon (C. guinea), and {{are the result of}} lack of melanin deposition during development. The yellow-buff coloured spots are very worn, while less worn feathers have white tips; this indicates that the former were stained during life or represent a different stage of plumage, and that the latter were fresher. The plumage of the spotted green pigeon was distinct in being very soft compared to that of other pigeons, perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long. The hackles were not as elongated as those of the Nicobar pigeon, and the feathers did not differ from those of other pigeons in their microstructure. The plumage was also distinct in being very pigmented, except for the tips of the feathers, and even the down was dark, unlike that of most other birds (a feature otherwise seen in aberrant plumage).|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} among the subspecies. For T. l. ludovicianus, the crown is rich brown that appears more chestnut-colored on its rump and uppertail-coverts. Shoulders and greater coverts are a rich brown, {{with a series of}} small white dots on the lesser primary coverts. The secondary coverts are rich brown with a darker brown barring on both webs; the bars on the primaries are on the outerwebs only, but darker and more noticeable. The retrices are brown with 18 to 20 bars that span across the tail. The white supercilious streak borders thinly with a black above and below, and extends above and beyond its shoulders. The ear coverts are <b>speckled</b> gray and grayish-black. Its chin and throat are grey that becomes buff on its chest, flank and belly, though the latter two are of a warmer color. The underwing coverts sport a grayish buff color. Its iris is reddish-brown, the upper mandible is lemon-colored and paler at the base and lower mandible. The legs are flesh-colored.|$|E
5|$|To {{overcome}} these challenges, researchers have employed various solutions. Astronomical interferometry, first conceived by Hippolyte Fizeau in 1868, was the seminal concept that has enabled major improvements in modern telescopy {{and led to}} the creation of the Michelson interferometer in the 1880s, and the first successful measurement of Betelgeuse. Just as human depth perception increases when two eyes instead of one perceive an object, Fizeau proposed the observation of stars through two apertures instead of one to obtain interferences that would furnish information on the star's spatial intensity distribution. The science evolved quickly and multiple-aperture interferometers are now used to capture <b>speckled</b> images, which are synthesized using Fourier analysis to produce a portrait of high resolution. It was this methodology that identified the hotspots on Betelgeuse in the 1990s. Other technological breakthroughs include adaptive optics, space observatories like Hipparcos, Hubble and Spitzer, and the Astronomical Multi-BEam Recombiner (AMBER), which combines the beams of three telescopes simultaneously, allowing researchers to achieve milliarcsecond spatial resolution.|$|E
5|$|When {{it first}} emerges from its egg, the young red-throated loon {{is covered with}} fine soft down feathers. Primarily dark brown to dark grey above, it is {{slightly}} paler {{on the sides of}} its head and neck, as well as on its throat, chest, and flanks, with a pale grey lower breast and belly. Within weeks, this first down is replaced by a second, paler set of down feathers, which are in turn replaced by developing juvenile feathers. The juvenile's plumage {{is similar to that of}} the adult, though with a few distinguishing features. It has a darker forehead and neck, with heavy speckling on the sides of the neck and the throat. Its back is browner and less <b>speckled,</b> and its underparts are tinged with brown. Its eyes are reddish-brown, and its beak is a pale grey. Though some young birds hold this plumage until mid-winter, many quickly become virtually indistinguishable from adults, except for their paler bills.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study from}} 2003–2004, there were 13 {{different}} species of fish in the Potlatch River watershed, including <b>speckled</b> dace, longnose dace, rainbow trout (both wild and farm-raised), brook trout, largemouth bass, pumpkinseed, northern pikeminnow, redside shiner, sculpin, bridgelip sucker, largescale sucker, and yellow perch. Migration of steelhead, the anadromous phase of rainbow trout, has been impacted by the construction of dams downstream on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. The two species of dace were cumulatively the largest individual fish population in the watershed, while steelhead accounted for 58.4% of the biomass. Of all the streams sampled during the study, the West Fork Potlatch River had the highest diversity because of its relatively pristine condition. The lower section of the river suffers from chronic pollution caused by agricultural runoff. From 2005 to 2008, the population of steelhead (rainbow) trout in the watershed was recorded by the Potlatch River Steelhead Monitoring and Evaluation Program (PRSME). There was no data for steelhead populations in the main stem but 197 adult steelhead were recorded in the East Fork of the river, while an average of 226 was recorded annually {{in one of the}} river's larger tributaries, Big Bear Creek. Over 1,000 steelhead are estimated to return to the Potlatch drainage in strong run years. Outmigration of steelhead smolt from the East Fork was estimated at 6,976 fish while the average for Big Bear Creek was 9,491. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game began a series of seven projects in 2009 in order to conserve fish habitat in the Potlatch.|$|E
5|$|Like other snake species, {{the forest}} cobra has skin covered in scales. Snakes are entirely covered with scales or scutes of various shapes and sizes, known as snakeskin as a whole. Scales protect {{the body of}} the snake, aid it in locomotion, allow {{moisture}} to be retained within, and alter the surface characteristics such as roughness to aid in camouflage. The dorsal scales of the forest cobra are smooth, glossy and strongly oblique. The colour of this species is variable, with three main colour morphs. Those from the forest or forest fringe, from Sierra Leone east to western Kenya and south to Angola are glossy black, the chin, throat and anterior region of the belly are cream or white, with broad black cross-bars and blotches. The sides of the head are strikingly marked with black and white, giving the impression of vertical black and white bars on the lips. The second colour morph, from the west African savanna, is banded black and yellow, with a black tail, the head is brownish-yellow on top, the lips, chin and throat are yellow. The third colour morph, from the coastal plain of east Africa, south to KwaZulu-Natal, inland to Zambia and southern Democratic Republic of Congo, is brownish or blackish-brown above, paler below, the belly is yellow or cream, heavily <b>speckled</b> with brown or black, and specimens from the southern part of its range have black tails. Melanistic (all black) specimens have been documented from west Africa.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Speckled</b> dace (Rhinichthys osculus) only occurs {{west of the}} Continental Divide in {{the park}} restricting it to the Snake River {{including}} Heart Lake and Fall River drainages.|$|E
25|$|Gulls nest in large, {{densely packed}} noisy colonies. They lay {{two or three}} <b>speckled</b> eggs in nests {{composed}} of vegetation. The young are precocial, being born with dark mottled down, and mobile upon hatching.|$|E
25|$|The Kishwaukee River {{watershed}} {{is home to}} 28 endangered, {{threatened or}} watch-listed species. Some examples include Iowa darter, sandhill crane, yellow-headed blackbird, black tern, <b>speckled</b> alder, mulberry wing butterfly, Blanding's turtle, and the spiked mussel.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} nuclear {{staining}} patterns seen on HEp-2 cells: homogeneous, <b>speckled,</b> nucleolar, nuclear membranous, centromeric, nuclear dot and pleomorphic. The homogeneous pattern is seen when the condensed chromosomes and interphase chromatin stain. This pattern {{is associated with}} anti-dsDNA antibodies, antibodies to nucleosomal components, and anti-histone antibodies. There are two <b>speckled</b> patterns: fine and coarse. The fine <b>speckled</b> pattern has fine nuclear staining with unstained metaphase chromatin, which is associated with anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. The coarse staining pattern has coarse granular nuclear staining, caused by anti-U1-RNP and anti-Sm antibodies. The nucleolar staining pattern is associated with many antibodies including anti-Scl-70, anti-PM-Scl, anti-fibrillarin and anti-Th/To. Nuclear membrane staining appears as a fluorescent ring around the cell nucleus and are produced by anti-gp210 and anti-p62 antibodies. The centromere pattern shows multiple nuclear dots in interphase and mitotic cells, corresponding {{to the number of}} chromosomes in the cell. Nuclear dot patterns show between 13–25 nuclear dots in interphase cells and are produced by anti-sp100 antibodies. Pleomorphic pattern is caused by antibodies to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Indirect immunofluorescence {{has been shown to be}} slightly superior compared to ELISA in detection of ANA from HEp-2 cells.|$|E
