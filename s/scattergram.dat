40|$|INTRODUCTION: Most studies {{dealing with}} {{automated}} hematology analyzers (HAs) and malaria diagnosis are conducted in endemic countries. METHODS: We retrospectively studied cell blood counts (CBCs) performed with Sysmex XE- 2100 and XE- 5000 HAs in our center (Angers, France) regarding 67 patients returning from endemic areas and infected with various Plasmodium species. RESULTS: In 83 % of infected samples with Plasmodium vivax (Pv), ovale (Po), or malariae (Pm), extra clouds of dots {{were present in}} neutrophil and/or eosinophil area(s) on routine differential (DIFF) <b>scattergrams.</b> In contrast, samples infected with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) failed to show such DIFF <b>scattergrams,</b> or any other suggesting malaria infection (0 / 49 pts). Abnormal areas from DIFF <b>scattergrams</b> {{were related to the}} presence of mature schizonts and gametocytes, undestroyed by lysis agent, the latter not observed in Pf-infected patients from our series. The internal parameter WBC[DIFF] - WBC[BASO] raised in parallel to parasitemia in Pv, Po, and Pm samples but could not be used as a surrogate for parasitemia. In Pf infection, reticulocyte/ immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF) ratio showed a significant correlation with parasitemia (P <  0. 05). A diagnostic model developed for Pf in endemic countries showed sensitivity of 77 %. CONCLUSION: Using SYSMEX analyzers, Pv, Po, and Pm infections are easy to ascertain as DIFF <b>scattergrams</b> are almost specific (specificity =  99. 9 %).

40|$|Constraint lines - the {{boundaries}} that delimit point clouds in bivariate <b>scattergrams</b> - {{have been applied}} in macro-ecology to quantify the effects of limiting factors on response variables, but have not been applied to the behavioral performance and physiological ecology of individual vertebrates. I propose that behavioral <b>scattergrams</b> of air-breathing, diving vertebrates contain informative edges that convey insights into physiological constraints that shape the performance envelopes of divers. In the classic example of repeated cycles of apnea and eupnea in diving, airbreathing vertebrates, the need to balance oxygen consumption and intake should differentially constrain recovery for dives within or exceeding the aerobic dive limit. However, the bulk of variance observed in recovery versus dive duration <b>scattergrams</b> originates from undetermined behavioral variables, and deviations from overall stasis may become increasingly apparent at progressively smaller scales of observation. As shown on dive records from 79 Gal&# 225;pagos fur seals, the selection of appropriate time scales of integration yields two distinct recovery boundaries for dive series within and beyond the estimated aerobic dive limit. An analysis of the corresponding constraint lines is independent of central tendencies in data and avoids violating parametric assumptions for large data sets where variables of interest account for {{only a small portion}} of observed variance.

40|$|Background: The WNR {{channel of}} the XN-Series {{automated}} hematology analyzer (Sysmex) counts {{white blood cells}} (WBCs) and simultaneously performs a differential counting of basophils and nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs). The detection process involves exposing the cells to WNR-specific reagents containing an acidic detergent and a fluorescent dye and measuring {{the intensity of the}} forward scattered light (FSC) and side fluorescence light (SFL). Method: We treated isolated peripheral WBCs and NRBCs with specific reagents and assessed the morphological changes in NRBCs and each leukocyte type using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: The results from a flow cytometer (FCM) showed that, after exposure to the reagents, basophils appeared on the highest FSC and SFL areas compared to other leukocytes on the WNR <b>scattergram.</b> Owing to the hemolysis of reticulocytes and erythrocytes, NRBCs that survived the reagent treatment could be distinguished by their lower intensity than those of the other leukocytes on the WNR <b>scattergram.</b> We investigated the significance {{of the relationship between the}} TEM and FCM results after the reagent treatment.

40|$|We propose an {{algorithm}} for estimating {{urban density}} from polarimetric {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) images, and compare the urban density patterns of global megacities. SAR images are uniquely able to detect structural information of objects, {{but they are very}} sensitive to orientation angle. This issue has been an obstacle to applying SAR images to urban areas. Kajimoto and Susaki (2013 b) proposed an algorithm to handle this issue. The effects of polarization orientation angle (POA) are removed by rotating the coherency matrix and then calculating the mean and standard deviation of scattering power by POA domain. The algorithm can estimate urban density from a single fully polarimetric SAR image but has the drawback that the generated urban density maps of multiple images are not comparable with each other because the algorithm generates a relative urban density valid only within the analyzed image. We therefore extend the method by calculating POA-domain statistics from all images of interest so that the generated maps can be compared. Estimated urban densities are assessed on two types of urban density generated from GIS data, building-to-land ratio and floor-area ratio. We demonstrate that the extended method can estimate urban density with reasonable accuracy. Finally, we generate two <b>scattergrams</b> of indices derived from urban density maps of global megacities. An analysis using the <b>scattergrams</b> indicates insightful information about the patterns of urban development. We conclude that the proposed algorithm and the analysis using the obtained results are beneficial to understanding the conditions in megacities...|$|R

Methods: Blood samples (n= 160) were grouped into 5 categories: acute leukemia (n= 30), chronic leukemia (n= 15), neoplasia without blood involvement (n= 41), non-neoplastic reactive conditions (n= 31), and healthy dogs (n= 43). WBC counts, WBC flags, <b>scattergrams,</b> percentages of cells with high fluorescence intensity, and percentages of cells in the lysis-resistant region were evaluated alone or in combination to establish a "leukemic flag. " Sensitivity, specificity, negative (LR-) and positive (LR+) likelihood ratios, and the number of false-negative (FN) and false-positive (FP) results were calculated, and receiver operating characteristic curves were designed for numerical values. Results: Among single measurements and parameters, only the evaluation of <b>scattergrams</b> minimized FN and FP results (sensitivity 100 %, specificity 94. 8 %, LR+ 19. 17, and LR- 0. 00), although their interpretation was subjective.
