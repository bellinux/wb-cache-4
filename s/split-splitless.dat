30|$|The Gas Chromatograph System 6890 N (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was {{coupled with}} a 5, 973 Mass Selective Detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) single-quadrupole mass spectrometer. For the gas chromatographic separation, an HP- 5 MS fused silica {{capillary}} column (5 % diphenyl- 95 % dimethyl-polysiloxane, 30  m ×  0.25  mm i.d., J&W Scientific Agilent Technologies, USA) with a de-activated silica pre-column (2  m ×  0.32  mm i.d., J&W Scientific Agilent Technologies, USA) was used. The <b>split-splitless</b> injector was used in splitless mode at 320 °C. The GC/MS parameters {{for the analysis of}} the different fractions are as follows: 80 °C isothermal for 2  min, 10 °C min− 1 up 200 °C and isothermal for 4  min, 6 °C min− 1 up 280 °C and isothermal for 40  min. The carrier gas (He, purity 99.9995 %) was used in the constant flow mode at 1.2  mL min− 1. Peaks assignments were performed using mass spectra interpretation, comparisons with mass spectral libraries (NIST 2.0) and with published mass spectra.|$|E
30|$|The {{amount of}} {{pesticide}} was quantified on a gas chromatograph Varian 450 equipped with two ECD detectors with <b>split-splitless</b> Varian 1177 injector systems. An Agilent CP-Sil 5 CB silica capillary column with 100 % dimethylpolysiloxane as the non-polar phase (15 mx, diameter 0.25  mm, film thickness 0.25  m) was used. The carrier gas was helium (purity 99.99 %), {{and the flow}} rate was maintained constant at 1.3  ml min− 1. The injector and detector temperature was maintained at 260 °C. The oven temperature was programmed as follows: 130 °C for 5  min, raised to 160 °C {{at a rate of}} 5 °C min− 1, maintained at 160 °C for 20  min, increased to 200 °C at a rate of 5 °C min− 1, and maintained at 200 °C for 15  min. The sample volume injected was 2  μl. Analytical-grade endosulfan (99 %) was used as the standard for the computation of the residual concentration of endosulfan in the broth culture. The retention time of the respective peak was compared using the standard.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} {{progress}} made {{in developing a}} water sampling system for detection and analysis of volatile organic compounds in water with a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS). Two approaches are described herein. The first approach uses a custom water pre-concentrator for performing trap and purge of VOCs from water. The second approach uses a custom micro-volume, <b>split-splitless</b> injector that is compatible with air and water. These water sampling systems will enable a single GC-based instrument to analyze air and water samples for VOC content. As reduced mass, volume, and power is crucial for long-duration, manned space-exploration, these water sampling systems will demonstrate {{the ability of a}} GCMS to monitor both air and water quality of the astronaut environment, thereby reducing the amount of required instrumentation for long duration habitation. Laboratory prototypes of these water sampling systems have been constructed and tested with a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer as well as a thermal conductivity detector. Presented herein are details of these water sampling system with preliminary test results...|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic {{volatile}} halocarbons are compounds {{of great}} environmental concern {{because of their}} involvement in global change phenomena. They {{are present in the}} atmosphere at concentration levels in the order of parts per trillion by volume. The chosen analytical method for their determination is capillary gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, preceded by an enrichment step on suitable adsorbent resins. The method here presented makes use of the solid-phase microextraction as a pre-analytical technique, using sub-ambient temperature in order to enhance the retention capability of the fiber coating. The proposed method was evaluated in terms of extraction efficiency, linearity, reproducibility, and limits of detection. Results obtained showed that trace atmospheric halocarbons are detectable even when enriching very small air sample volumes. A good chromatographic resolution is obtained {{as a consequence of the}} extremely low injection volume. Finally a standard GC-MS instrumentation equipped with a simple <b>split-splitless</b> injector was employed, thus avoiding the use of expensive dedicated apparatus. The method was also applied to the analysis of actual samples collected both in remote, and in semi-remote site...|$|E
30|$|For the Py(HMDS)-GC/MS analysis, {{the sample}} (< 0.1  mg) {{was placed in}} a quartz tube (held in place by glass wool), admixed with 5  μl {{hexamethyldisilazane}} (HMDS) and pyrolysed at 480 °C (pyrolysis time: 20 s). The pyrolyser (CDS Pyroprobe 5000 series) was coupled online with a 6890  N GC System Gas Chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) coupled with a 5973 Mass Selective Detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) single quadrupole mass spectrometer. The pyrolyser interface was kept at 280 °C, the transfer line at 300 °C, and the valve oven at 290 °C. For the gas chromatographic separation, an HP- 5 MS fused silica capillary column (5 % diphenyl- 95 % dimethyl-polysiloxane, 30  m × 0.25  mm i.d., J&W Scientific Agilent Technologies, USA) with a de-activated silica pre-column (2  m × 0.32  mm i.d., J&W Scientific Agilent Technologies, USA) was used. The <b>split-splitless</b> injector was used in split mode at 300 °C, with a split ratio of 1 : 10. The chromatographic conditions were as follows: 40 °C isothermal for 5  min, 15 °C/min up to 300 °C and isothermal for 25  min. The carrier gas (He, purity 99.9995 %) was used in the constant flow mode at 1.0  mL/min.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To investigate, for {{the first}} time, the {{chemical}} composition of essential oil of the tubers and leaves of Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.), a species of sunflower native to eastern North America, growing in Ukraine. Methods: A hydrodistillation apparatus {{was used for the}} extraction of volatile components and then it was analysed by gas chromatography equipped with a <b>split-splitless</b> injector (split ratio, 1 : 50) and flame ionization detector (FID). The oil was analyzed under linear temperature programming applied at 4 °C/min from 50 °C - 340 °C. Temperatures of the injector and FID detector were maintained at 280 °C and 300 °C, respectively. The chemical analysis of the oil was carried out using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), to determine the chemical composition of the volatile fraction. Results: The essential oils content ranged from 0. 00019 to 0. 03486 and 0. 00011 to 0. 00205 (g/ 100 g), in leaves and tubers, respectively. The qualitative and quantitative analysis led to the identification of 17 components in both species samples. The major component found in leaves and tubers was (-) -β-bisabolene with 70. 7 % and 63. 1 %, respectively. Conclusion:> Essential oil profile of Jerusalem artichoke species showed significant differences between leaves and tubers species. Additionally, the leaves of Jerusalem artichoke are a promising source of natural β-bisabolene...|$|E
