6000|$|The ghostly western hills {{seemed to}} recede as we {{advanced}} over the endless rolling plain.

As we advanced our Widads, who, poor devils! had been [...] "roasted" [...] {{by the women}} all day on account of their poverty, began to recite the Koran with might, in gratitude for having escaped many perils. Night deepening, our attention was rivetted by a strange spectacle; a broad sheet of bright blaze, reminding me of Hanno's fiery river, swept apparently down a hill, and, according to my companions, threatened the whole prairie. These accidents are common: a huntsman burns a tree for honey, or cooks his food in the dry grass, the wind rises and the flames spread far and wide. On this occasion no accident occurred; the hills, however, smoked like a <b>Solfatara</b> for two days.|$|E

50|$|Volcanic {{activity}} began 1.1 {{million years}} ago in the area and a series of lava domes in the region surrounding the lake were created in about 290,000 years ago. One of the biggest of these domes collapsed leaving a caldera that in time filled with water and transformed into a freshwater lake capable of sustaining life. <b>Solfataras</b> (fumaroles that emits sulfuric gases) occurring on its southwest rim is evident that under this lake is a sleeping active volcano.

60|$|I {{had been}} {{prepared}} by descriptions for a huge chasm-like crater or craters like those on Theon Ochéma, Camerones Peak. I found a spoon-shaped hollow, with a gradual slope to the centre, 100 × 150 feet deep, the greater length of the oval running north-east, where the side is higher, to south-west, where {{there is also a}} tilt of the cup. The floor was a surface of burning marl and whitish earthy dough-like paste, the effect of sulphurous acid vapours upon the argile of the lava. This stratum was in places more than 80 feet thick; and fumes rose fetid with sulphuric acid, and sulphates of soda, alumina, and ammonia from the dead white, purple red, vivid green, and brilliant yellow surface of the <b>solfatara.</b> Hence the puffs of vapour seen from below against the sparkling blue sky, and disappearing like huge birds upon the wings of the wind: hence, too, the tradition of the mast and the lateen sail. A dig with the Guanche magada or lanza, the island alpen-stock, either outside or inside the crater, will turn up, under the moist white clay, lovely trimetric crystals of sulphur, with the palest straw tint, deepening to orange, and beautifully disposed in acicular shapes. The acid eats paper, and the colours fade before they leave the cone.|$|E
6000|$|Lieutenant Yusuf was {{presently}} despatched {{with three}} soldiers, three quarrymen, Jází, the Arab guide {{of a former}} visit, and eight camels, to bring back specimens of the copper silicate {{to the south of}} Aynánah, and to make a regular survey of the northern <b>solfatara.</b> He set out early on February 18th, and after twenty-one hours of caravan-marching reached the Jebel el-Fara'. Here the outcrop is bounded north by the Wady el-Fara', and south by the Wadys el-Maríkhah and Umm Nírán, the latter forming the general recipient of these Nullahs. The Jebel is about 120 feet high, of oval form, stretching 1750 metres from north-north-west to south-south-east. The rich silicate (not carbonate) of copper, which disdains a streak and affects the file, is found, as usual with this ore, only {{in one part of the}} valley to the south-west, some thirty-five feet above the sole: it is a pocket, a [...] "circumscribed deposit," [...] as opposed to a [...] "true vein" [...] or a [...] "vein-fissure." [...] The adjoining rocks contain carbonates of iron and copper, and the ore-mass is apparently carbonate of lime. This second visit generally confirmed the report of Ahmed Kaptán, except that there were no signs of working, as he had supposed. The travellers passed the whole of February 20th at the diggings, made a plan, and sent back two camel-loads (four sacks) of the gangue, in charge of a soldier, to the Fort of El-Muwaylah.|$|E
