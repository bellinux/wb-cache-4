5|$|Florence Nagle (26 October 1894– 30 October 1988) was {{a trainer}} and breeder of racehorses, a breeder of {{pedigree}} dogs, and an active feminist. Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913, {{and went on}} to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions. Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle. She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish <b>Setters,</b> from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions. The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish <b>Setters.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Blue Picardy Spaniel (or Épagneul Bleu de Picardie) is a {{breed of}} Spaniel {{originating}} in France, {{from the area}} around the mouth of the River Somme, around the start of the 20th century. It is descended from Picardy Spaniels and English <b>Setters,</b> and is described as a quiet breed that requires much exercise due to its stamina. It is especially good with children. Similar to the Picardy Spaniel, it has a distinctive coloured coat. Recognised by only a handful of kennel associations, the breed is predominantly known in France and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Waddington {{relied upon}} experience; Dennis Viollet, Jackie Mudie, Roy Vernon, Maurice <b>Setters</b> and Jimmy McIlroy were players signed {{in the later}} stages of their careers. Matthews was awarded a knighthood for {{services}} to football in the 1965 New Year's Honours list. This was followed by his final, league appearance for the club against Fulham in February 1965, shortly after his 50th birthday. It ended a career spanning 33 years, including 19 years' service to his home town club. Gordon Banks, England's 1966 World Cup winning goalkeeper, joined Stoke from Leicester in 1967 for £52,000. Regarded as the best goalkeeper in the world, Banks {{proved to be a}} shrewd signing for Waddington as he helped the club maintain stability in the First Division. However, Banks was forced to quit top-level football in 1972, after losing an eye in a road accident.|$|E
50|$|A 5-1 {{takes its}} name from using 1 <b>setter</b> and having 5 attackers on the court. The {{secondary}} <b>setter</b> is replaced by an opposite hitter who is always opposite the <b>setter</b> on the court. This formation allows the <b>setter</b> to be able to dump the ball for half the rotations and have 3 front row attackers to set the ball to on the other three rotations. This system allows the <b>setter</b> to set any possible set he or she wants to depending on whether he or she is front row or back row. Many coaches prefer this system, having one <b>setter</b> as the team leader. It also helps having only one <b>setter</b> so that the setting does not change. One <b>setter</b> may set the ball differently from another giving a different feel for the attackers. It helps when the attackers are used to one <b>setter</b> in particular. The negative points of this offense are that the <b>setter</b> needs to transition from defense to set the ball. This creates situations where the <b>setter</b> has the first contact and someone else has to set the ball.|$|R

25|$|Trap <b>setters</b> – {{are used}} to set pots or traps for {{catching}} fish, crabs, lobsters, crayfish and other similar species. Trap <b>setters</b> {{range in size from}} open boats operating inshore to larger decked vessels, 20 to 50 metres long, operating out {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf. Small decked trap <b>setters</b> have the wheelhouse either forward or aft with the fish hold amidships. They use hydraulic or mechanical pot haulers. Larger vessels have the wheelhouse forward, and are equipped with derricks, davits or cranes for hauling pots aboard. Locating fish is often more a matter of the fishermen's knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than the use of special detection equipment. Decked vessels are usually equipped with an echosounder, and large vessels may also have a Loran or GPS.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, Field and Stream {{magazine}} {{put into}} writing what {{was already a}} well-known fact. The Irish Setter was disappearing {{from the field and}} an outcross would be necessary to resurrect the breed as a working dog. Sports Afield chimed in with a similar call for an outcross. Ned LaGrande of Pennsylvania spent a small fortune purchasing examples of the last of the working Irish <b>Setters</b> in America and importing dogs from overseas. With the blessing of the Field Dog Stud Book, he began an outcross to red and white field champion English <b>Setters.</b> The National Red Setter Field Trial Club was created to test the dogs and to encourage breeding toward a dog that would successfully compete with the white <b>setters.</b> Thus the modern Red Setter was born and the controversy begun.|$|E

25|$|During the Second World War, the Spinone became {{close to}} extinct. Both {{the war and}} the fact that Italian hunters had begun using other breeds (such as <b>setters,</b> pointers, and spaniels) in the hunt, whereas before it was {{primarily}} the Spinone.

40|$|The recent {{discoveries of}} {{regulatory}} non-coding RNAs changed {{our view of}} RNA as a simple infor-mation transfer molecule. Understanding the archi-tecture and function of active RNA molecules requires methods for comparing and analyzing their 3 D structures. While structural alignment of short RNAs is achievable in {{a reasonable amount of}} time, large structures represent much bigger challenge. Here, we present the <b>SETTER</b> web server for the RNA structure pairwise comparison utilizing the <b>SETTER</b> (SEcondary sTructure-based TERtiary Structure Similarity Algorithm) algorithm. The <b>SETTER</b> method divides an RNA structure into the set of non-overlapping structural elements called generalized secondary structure units (GSSUs). The <b>SETTER</b> algorithm scales as O(n 2) with the size of a GSSUs and as O(n) with the number of GSSUs in the structure. This scaling gives <b>SETTER</b> its high speed as the average size of the GSSU remains constant irrespective {{of the size of the}} structure. However, the favorable speed of the algorithm does not compromise its accuracy.

25|$|As {{climbing}} routes {{or problems}} increase in difficulty, climbers learn to develop skills {{that help them}} complete the climbs clean. There are several techniques for hands and feet as well as terms for motions that combine the two. For indoor gyms, route <b>setters</b> visualize and create routes for climbers, placing different kinds of holds in specific parts of the wall at particular angles because they intend climbers to use certain techniques.|$|E
25|$|Some people {{familiar}} with the history of the breed claim that the Spinone descended from the now-extinct Spanish Pointer, whilst others claim that it was the ancient Russian Setter that is responsible for the breed we know today. An even more popular theory is that Greek traders brought coarse-haired <b>setters</b> to Italy {{during the height of the}} Roman empire, where the dogs were then crossed with various others and the modern Spinone eventually emerged.|$|E
50|$|Another {{aspect is}} to see the <b>setter</b> as an attacking force, albeit a {{weakened}} force, because when the <b>setter</b> is in the front court {{they are able to}} 'tip' or 'dump', so when the ball is close to the net on the second touch, the <b>setter</b> may opt to hit the ball over with one hand. This means that the blocker who would otherwise not have to block the <b>setter</b> is engaged and may allow one of the hitters to have an easier attack.|$|R
