5|$|Additions {{to the end}} musical number, {{including}} visual gags such as Bob {{appearing in}} uniform, were added after the animatics. The crew felt that watching the character singing would not be interesting enough {{and they had to}} include these gags to make it work. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> saw the additions, because he originally thought they were silly and would not appear in the final cut, but he has grown to like them.|$|E
5|$|Los Angeles robbery-homicide {{sergeant}} Vincent Hanna (Plank) is on {{the trail}} of a gang of ruthless professional criminals, led by the methodical Patrick McLaren (McArthur), whose only mistake in the last heist was the killing of armored car guards by the new recruit, Waingro (Berkeley), who is a loose cannon. But Hanna is soon <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> discovers that he and McLaren have quite a lot in common. While McLaren and his gang plan another heist, Hanna and his colleagues keep surveillance. Hanna is facing a personal problem, as the police work is straining his relationship with his wife, Lillian (Pouget). Moreover, McLaren is also facing a similar problem when he finds himself falling in love with Eady (Harrington), which he personally condemns due to the commitment required to his profession.|$|E

25|$|In 1565, the Captain-major João Pereira {{brought the}} carrack {{to the port}} of Yokoseura with the {{intention}} of going to trade in Hirado. He was dissuaded from doing so by the Jesuits in Yokoseura, and was persuaded to head to another Ōmura anchorage at the bay of Fukuda, within present-day Nagasaki, accompanied by a small galleon belonging to Diogo de Meneses, the captain of Malacca. Deprived of his potential pickings, Matsura Takanobu sought to punish the Portuguese for switching ports and conspired with Sakai merchants who came all the way to Hirado for naught. Matsura promised to divide the booty with the Sakai merchants in return for the loan of eight to ten of their large junks, and attached up to sixty smaller Japanese boats to form a flotilla carrying several hundred samurai to sail to Fukuda. The Jesuit fathers in Hirado sent warnings to Pereira when they realized what Takanobu was doing, but Pereira dismissed the threat. He was hence <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> saw the Hirado flotilla approach from the horizon.|$|E

However, things did not turn up according to his plans the following day, as he was late and was still suffering the effects of a hangover. When Harrison played the sample to Beyoncé in the studio, the singer initially had doubts about the [...] "sound so full of blaring fanfare;" [...] it seemed too retro and according to her, no one used horn riffs in the 21st century. Nevertheless, Beyoncé became friendlier to the sample, much to Harrison's delight, and gave him two hours to write and compose the song while she went out.|$|E

He entered {{production of the}} episode with little knowledge {{of the nature of}} The X-Files, and was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> received the screenplay. During his first day on set, he asked other cast members if the series was always so violent. An unidentified crew member said, [...] "this is awful even for us", and commented that it was probably the most gruesome episode of the series run. During the sheriff's death scene Smallwood insisted on performing his own stunts, until he hit [...] his head attempting a dive.

500|$|Beaver had {{previously}} worked with executive producer Robert Singer {{on the television}} series Reasonable Doubts, and Singer gave him the part without viewing his audition tape. The character is named after Singer, though how this came to be is uncertain. Singer himself claimed Kripke secretly slipped the name into the script for [...] "Devil's Trap"; contradicting this was Beaver, who claimed that the surname {{was not in the}} script but was rather jokingly added onto a salvage-yard sign—"Singer Auto Parts"—by the set designers. The actor thought his initial appearance would be a [...] "one-shot deal", and was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was asked to return. Beaver feels that his longevity on the show is due to his chemistry with Ackles and Padalecki.|$|E

500|$|American actor Kelsey Grammer {{was brought}} in to guest star as Sideshow Bob for the third time. At that time, Grammer had become a {{household}} name as the lead of the television series Frasier, which was in production {{at the same time as}} this episode. Grammer did not know that the rake scene was extended, because he had only done the moan once and was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> saw the final product. The show's writers admire Grammer's singing voice, and try to include a song for each appearance including this episode. Alf Clausen, the primary composer for The Simpsons, commented that [...] " [...] is so great. He's just amazing. You can tell he has this love of musical theater and he has the vocal instrument to go with it, so I know whatever I write is going to be sung the way I've heard it." ...|$|E

Fey said that the character of Jack Donaghy was written with Baldwin in mind, and she was [...] "very pleasantly <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> agreed to do it". Judah Friedlander was cast as Frank Rossitano, a staff writer of The Girlie Show. Friedlander had never met Fey before auditioning for a role in 30Rock. His character was based {{on at least two}} writers with whom Fey used to work at SNL, but he has said that he [...] "certainly brought some of [...] own things to it, as well". Finally, Scott Adsit was cast as Pete Hornberger, a longtime friend of Liz's and producer of The Girlie Show. Adsit, an old friend of Fey's, also had his character written based on him.|$|E
500|$|Evil Dead-actor Bruce Campbell was Kripke's {{first choice}} {{to portray the}} character. However, Campbell was unavailable, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan {{eventually}} received the role. Due {{to the fact that}} Morgan's scene in the pilot episode takes place 22 years before the series, Morgan expected to be replaced by an older actor for subsequent episodes. Being only 12 years older than Jensen Ackles, who portrays the eldest son Dean, Morgan was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was asked to reprise the role. Ackles and Jared Padalecki often teased him about the age difference during filming. Throughout the season, Morgan became frustrated at times due to his character's avoidance of his sons, stating, [...] "It pissed off everybody, it pissed off us as actors, it pissed off the audience watching, because none of us really knew where we were gonna go." [...] However, he reasoned that John's motivation for his actions was due to having knowledge that nobody else had.|$|E

500|$|Admitting that he {{was viewed}} as a [...] "pudgy, fun-loving, music-crazed bum" [...] in his youth, Hull stated in his {{autobiography}} {{that he was}} not <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> failed {{to attract the attention of}} a junior team. He was first eligible for the NHL Entry Draft in 1982, but as he was still playing in a juvenile league, was passed over without interest. He joined the Penticton Knights of the tier-II British Columbia Junior Hockey League (BCJHL) in the 1982–83 season where he scored 48 goals in 50 games. He was again passed over at the 1983 Entry Draft as teams remained unconvinced of his commitment to the game and his conditioning. NHL teams finally took notice of Hull following his 1983–84 season in which he scored 105 goals in 56 games and broke the BCJHL scoring record with 188 points. The Calgary Flames selected him in the sixth round of the 1984 NHL Entry Draft, 117th overall.|$|E
500|$|Cate Blanchett plays Soviet agent Irina Spalko. Screenwriter David Koepp {{created the}} character. Frank Marshall said Spalko {{continued}} {{the tradition of}} Indiana having a love-hate relationship [...] "with every woman he ever comes in contact with." [...] Blanchett had wanted to play a villain for a [...] "couple of years", and enjoyed {{being part of the}} Indiana Jones legacy. Spielberg praised Blanchett as a [...] "master of disguise", and considers her his favorite Indiana Jones villain for inventing much of Spalko's character. Spalko's bob cut was her idea, with the character's stern looks and behaviour recalling Rosa Klebb in From Russia with Love. Blanchett learned to fence for the character; but during filming, Spielberg decided to give Spalko [...] "karate chop" [...] skills. LaBeouf recalled Blanchett was elusive on set, and Ford was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> met her on set out of costume. He noted, [...] "There's no aspect of her behavior that was not consistent with this bizarre person she's playing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{journey to}} Philadelphia was Mason's first beyond Virginia and Maryland. According to Josephine T.

Broadwater suggested that Mason went to Philadelphia because he knew the federal congress needed additional power, and because he felt that body could act as a check on the powers of state legislatures. As the Virginians waited for the other delegates to arrive, they met each day and formulated what became known as the Virginia Plan. They also did some sightseeing, and were presented to Pennsylvania's president, Benjamin Franklin. Within a week of arrival, Mason was bored with the social events to which the delegates were invited, [...] "I begin to grow tired of the etiquette and nonsense so fashionable in this city".|$|E
