25|$|Benthic, or bottom-dwelling, fishes include white {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser transmontanus), white catfish (Ameiurus catus), and <b>starry</b> <b>flounder</b> (Platichthys stellatus). Because of their habitat orientation, they feed primarily on epibenthic organisms such as amphipods, bay shrimp, and bivalves.

25|$|In general, {{hematocrit}} is {{the number}} of red blood cells (RBC) in circulation and is highly variable among fish species. Active fish, like the blue marlin, tend to have higher hematocrits, whereas less active fish, such as the <b>starry</b> <b>flounder</b> exhibit lower hematocrits. Hematocrit may be increased in response to both short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) hypoxia exposure and results in an increase in the total amount of oxygen the blood can carry, also known as the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. Acute changes in hematocrit are the result of circulating stress hormones (see - catecholamines) activating receptors on the spleen that cause the release of RBCs into circulation. During chronic hypoxia exposure, the mechanism used to increase hematocrit is independent of the spleen and results from hormonal stimulation of the kidney by erythropoetin (EPO). Increasing hematocrit in response to erythropoietin is observed after approximately one week and is therefore likely under genetic control of hypoxia inducible factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF).|$|E
5000|$|Platichthys is a genus of flatfish, {{known as}} the <b>starry</b> <b>flounders,</b> native to the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans. Despite being in the family Pleuronectidae (popularly known as righteye flounders), both species in the genus Platichthys are often [...] "lefteyed", i.e. they lie on the sea bottom on their right side, with both eyes on the left side.|$|R
50|$|<b>Starry</b> <b>flounders</b> are inshore fish, ranging up {{estuaries}} {{well into}} the freshwater zone, to the first riffles, with young found as much as 120 km inland. In marine environments, they occur as deep as 375 m. They glide over the bottom by rippling their dorsal and anal fins, feeding {{on a variety of}} benthic invertebrates. Larvae start out consuming planktonic algae and crustaceans, then as they metamorphose they shift to larger prey.|$|R
50|$|Like all flounders, {{when they}} are young, <b>starry</b> <b>flounders</b> swim around like normal fish in a {{vertical}} position, but soon they begin to tilt to one side as they swim and eventually live lying on the sandy floor. As well as many other changes in body structure, the migration {{of one of the}} eyes {{to the other side of}} the head is one of the most crucial changes. Other changes include the loss of dark color on the under side.|$|R

50|$|The <b>starry</b> <b>flounder</b> before {{metamorphosis}} {{is dependent}} upon planktonic organisms as a food source during its younger stage of life. Feeding is usually done by waiting for the prey to settle to the floor or around eye level of the flounder and then make a quick lunge at the food drawing a mouthful of water also to help pull the prey in. As the fish develops more, {{they are able to}} feed upon small clams, some larger fish, invertebrates and also worms. When the <b>starry</b> <b>flounder</b> reaches adulthood the primary stomach contents that has been found are clams. Clams that are too large for ingestion often have their siphons eaten.|$|E

50|$|Sea life {{features}} 24 {{species of}} fish located {{in one of three}} habitats: riverine, estuarine or the Nisqually Reach nearshore. Large populations of fall Chinook salmon, <b>starry</b> <b>flounder</b> and shiner perch offer a sampling of the fish that are abundantly available. The saltmarshes and mudflats are located outside of the dikes. Rich in nutrients, they are the home to clams, crabs, shrimp and worms, which in turn feed ducks, gulls and herons.|$|E
50|$|Endangered {{species that}} {{are found in the}} bay include the California brown pelican, California clapper rail, and salt marsh harvest mouse. This is a popular {{destination}} for recreation fishing, with Saltwater species including: striped bass, surfperch, sturgeon, <b>starry</b> <b>flounder,</b> leopard shark, topsmelt, and anchovy. In the 1880s there was a shrimp-fishing village, where some 500 Chinese people lived; they shipped approximately 90% of their catch to China. The location is now part of China Camp State Park.|$|E
50|$|Hybrids {{are well}} known in flatfishes. The Pleuronectidae, of marine fishes, have {{the largest number of}} {{reported}} hybrids. Two of the most famous intergeneric hybrids are between the European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and European flounder (Platichthys flesus) in the Baltic Sea, and between the English sole (Parophrys vetulus) and <b>starry</b> <b>flounder</b> (Platichthys stellatus) in Puget Sound. The offspring of the latter species pair is popularly known as the hybrid sole and was initially believed to be a valid species in its own right.|$|E
50|$|The <b>starry</b> <b>flounder</b> has a {{multitude}} of well studied behaviors that are exhibited on a daily basis. At a normal resting position the dorsal and anal fins are angled so to prevent the body from resting upon the substrate, support being given by the fins, so as to create a cushion of water between the fish and the substrate. This is also for water to escape through an opening on the blind side, gill slit, of the fish and lessens the amount of effort needed to move.|$|E
5000|$|The {{distinctive}} {{features of the}} <b>starry</b> <b>flounder</b> include the combination of black and white-to-orange bar on the dorsal and anal fins, {{as well as the}} skin covered with scales modified into tiny star-shaped plates or tubercles (thus both the common name and species epithet), resulting in a rough feel. The eyed side is black to dark brown, while the lower side is white or cream-colored. Although classed as [...] "righteye flounders," [...] individuals may have their eyes on either the right or left side. They have been recorded at up to 91 cm and 9 kg.|$|E
50|$|Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), {{coho salmon}} (O. kisutch),steelhead and {{resident}} coastal rainbow trout (O. mykiss irideus), coastal cutthroat trout (O. clarki clarki), {{and the occasional}} sockeye salmon (O. nerka) and chum salmon (O. keta). The Mad River watershed also contains several non-salmonid fish species. Native resident fish include the Pacific lamprey (Lampetra tridentata), prickly sculpin (Cottus asper), coast range sculpin (C. aleuticus), Sacramento sucker (Catostomas occidentalis), Humboldt sucker (Catostomas occidentalis humboldtianus), three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteous aculeatus), and estuarine species such as longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthy), <b>starry</b> <b>flounder</b> (Platichthys stellatus), and eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus). California roach (Lavinia ssymmetricus), brown bullhead (Ictalurus nebulosus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), and green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) represent non-native fish species introduced into the watershed.|$|E
50|$|Predators {{include the}} seastar Pisaster brevispinus and the <b>starry</b> <b>flounder</b> Platichthys stellatus {{as well as}} crabs and sea gulls. They are {{sometimes}} settled on by a small barnacle, Paraconcavus pacificus. Large storms or high temperatures and desiccation can cause mass mortality if low tide coincides with a hot midday and the animals are exposed to air for just 2 to 3 hours or washed up and buried in the sand. Old age {{is thought to be}} the main cause of death of Dendraster excentricus. They may live up to 13 years and can be aged by counting growth rings on the plates of the test or by counting the pores in a petal of the petalidium.|$|E
5000|$|Because the Pysht River, {{like the}} Hoko River, is brushy, full of snags, and often carries tannin stained water, {{it is known}} as a [...] "cedar creek". The river {{supports}} nine species of freshwater fish, five salmonid and four non-salmonid. The non-salmonids known {{to be found in the}} Pysht River include Pacific lamprey (Lampetra tridentata), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and two freshwater sculpin species: coastrange sculpin (Cottus aleuticus) and prickly sculpin (Cottus asper). Salmonid species include chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta), sea-run coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki), and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus). Other fish species are likely to be present in the river's estuary, but which have not been formally sampled, include <b>starry</b> <b>flounder,</b> surf perches, and smelts.|$|E
50|$|Fish {{species of}} Pacific {{sandlance}} (Ammodytes personatus) {{is found in}} fairly large number in the harbor. They feed on crustaceans, barnacle larve, copepods, and chaetognaths. They in turn are the food chain and form the feed source for marine mammals, birds and other species of fish. Seals are spotted, ringed, and bearded species; spotted is seen when the sea is calm (seals and seal oil form the staple diet {{of the people who}} live on the shores of the harbor in towns like Teller). Herring, whitefish, <b>starry</b> <b>flounder,</b> pike and tomcod are netted during spring, fall and midsummer. All five salmon species are found here of which red salmon is the primary catch and they migrate inland to the Salmon Lake to breed. Chum salmon migrate to the Pilgrim River and Agiapuk River. King salmon are rare.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>starry</b> <b>flounder</b> has an oval shaped {{body with}} a slender, pointed head. Its eyed side is an olive to dark brown or almost black in some cases and the blind side is a white or creamy white color. This species has {{unpaired}} fins ranging from a white to yellow-orange complexion, with black bands running perpendicular to the fish. The posterior fin or caudal fin is nearly square on this species of flounder or sometimes slightly rounded. Lateral lines with a slight curve run over the pectoral fin and a complete lack of an accessory dorsal branch is found within this species. This species relies heavily on its strong anal spine for swimming. [...] This anal spine is used as the primary driver of locomotion while the fish is swimming through the open ocean. Through an up and down motion the fish achieves a propelling effect.|$|E
5000|$|The Pillar Point Harbor at the {{northern}} edge of Half Moon Bay offers a protected landing for boats and provides other marine infrastructure. In the late 1980s a new master plan was developed for the Harbor. [...] A variety of fish species have been identified in the harbor area. The most abundant fish include flatfish, particularly the speckled sanddab (Citharichthys stigmaeus) and the commercially important English sole (Parophrys vetulus), several species of rockfish (Sebastes sp.) with boccacio (S. paucispinis) most abundant, many members of the surfperch family, the most abundant being shiner (Cymanogaster aggregata) and dwarf surfperches (Micrometrus minimus), and the commercially important Pacific herring (Clupea harengus). Smaller populations of many other species, including significant commercial or sport species such as various surfperch, flatfish including halibut (Paralichthys californicus), lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), and cabezon (Scoraenichthys marmotarus) also are found in the harbor during the summer. Abundant winter species include <b>starry</b> <b>flounder</b> (Platichthys stellatus) and topsmelt (Atherinops affinis). At Pillar Point Harbor, fishermen sell crab and fish catches straight off their boats at discount prices directly to the public, and restaurants will fillet the fish for purchasers.|$|E

First, A higher hematocrit results in more viscous blood (especially in cold water) increasing the amount of energy the cardiac system requires to pump the blood through the system and secondly depending on the transit time of the blood across the branchial arch and the diffusion rate of oxygen, an increased hematocrit may result in less efficient transfer of oxygen from the environment to the blood.|$|E

This study focusses (1) on the effect of prebiotics glucan/MOS on growth and fitness of <b>Starry</b> <b>flounder</b> and (2) on the viability of <b>Starry</b> <b>flounder</b> as an aquaculture candidate (as it is considered in South Korea). Over 56 - days, juvenile <b>Starry</b> <b>flounder</b> were fed with glucan/MOS enhanced diet and a control diet. Feeding behavior, growth rate, morphological and blood physiological parameters were monitored. Fish fed glucan/MOS enriched diets exhibited significantly increased growth over the experimental period (GLM, p< 0. 01). Concentrations of cholesterol (P= 0. 043) and albumin (P= 0. 016) were significantly increased in the blood plasma of fish fed glucan/MOS. Whole body proximate analysis revealed significantly elevated crude protein (P=< 0. 001) and lipid (P=< 0. 005) in fish fed glucan/MOS compared to the control. Significant improvements in growth, numerous fitness factors and product quality parameters can be achieved through glucan/MOS supplementation to P. stellatus.

40|$|Abstract. —Since it {{was first}} {{described}} as a biological species by Jordan and Gilbert in 1880, Inopsetta ischyra has been a disputed taxonomic unit, generally regarded in recent decades as an intergeneric hybrid between English sole Parophrys vetulus and <b>starry</b> <b>flounder</b> Platichthys stellatus, {{both of which are}} common in coastal waters of the eastern North Pacific. Here, we investigate this suspected hybridization with molecular genetic and morphological data. Genotyping at four diagnostic allozyme loci clearly demonstrates that I. ischyra is an intergeneric hybrid between English sole and starry flounder; one individual was homozygous at one locus and may have been a backcross with <b>starry</b> <b>flounder.</b> Diagnostic restriction fragment length polymorphisms of a 464 -base-pair region of the cytochrome b gene revealed symmetric, two-way directionality of hybridization in which 50 % of maternities are assigned to each of the parental species.
