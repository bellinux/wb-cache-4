5|$|He was courageous in battle, {{open and}} straightforward, incorruptible and impeccable, and strict towards himself. He {{cared about the}} masses, and was never {{concerned}} about his own advantage. He was never afraid of difficulties, neither of carrying heavy loads. In his revolutionary work, he was dilligent, honest, and he had an utmost <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ali Aaltonen was {{replaced}} by Eero Haapalainen. He in turn was displaced by the Eino Rahja, Adolf Taimi and Evert Eloranta triumvirate. The last Red Guard commander in chief was Kullervo Manner. Some talented men with a high <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> such as Hugo Salmela in Tampere rose up to take the lead, {{but they could not}} change the course of the war. The Reds achieved some local victories, as they retreated from southern Finland toward Russia, e.g. against German troops in the fierce Battle of Syrjäntaka on 28–29 April in Tuulos.|$|E
5|$|The {{core of the}} museum's {{holdings}} is Kanoo's own {{collection of}} Qur'anic manuscripts and Islamic art, since he was reportedly {{said to have been}} an avid collector. As his collection grew, he reportedly came to feel a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> toward the rare manuscripts he had acquired. In 1990, he donated his collection to the museum he established to operate a first-of-its-kind institution dedicated to the service of the Qur'an and the preservation of historic manuscripts.|$|E

5|$|When Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to {{organize}} the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar {{for the first time}} in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the deck of the ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C. where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted out of a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility,</b> rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team erected two posts {{on the summit}} plateau to assist walkers {{attempting}} the descent in foggy conditions. These posts were subsequently cut down by climbers, sparking controversy in mountaineering circles on the ethics of such additions. Critics argued that cairns and posts are an unnecessary man-made intrusion into the natural landscape, which create {{a false sense of}} security and could lessen mountaineers' <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> for their own safety. Supporters of navigational aids pointed to the high number of accidents that occurred on the mountain (between 1990 and 1995 alone there were 13 fatalities, although eight of these were due to falls while rock climbing rather than navigational error), the long tradition of placing such aids on the summit, and the potentially life-saving role they could play. A series of solidly-constructed cairns currently (September 2009) marks the upper reaches of the Pony Track.|$|E

Furthermore, as former colonial powers, we both have important international interests.|$|E
25|$|After briefly {{addressing}} {{the rise of}} secular values, Dawkins goes on to discuss morality with the novelist Ian McEwan. McEwan takes as his starting point the mortality of human life, which he says should naturally lead to a morality based on empathy – one which he claims should confer upon us a clear <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> for our brief span on earth.|$|E
25|$|Canadian {{society and}} {{government}} experienced a greater awareness and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> {{that led to}} the development of a wilderness consciousness and preservation ethic. Wildlife began to be protected as an intrinsically valuable international resource rather than a simple tourist attraction or a commodity. Canada's history of wildlife conservation movement demonstrates how a small faction of dedicated civil servants transformed their own goals of preserving endangered species into active government policy.|$|E

Lola's mother also died under suspicious circumstances, when Phyllis was her nurse. Neff begins seeing Lola, {{at first to}} keep her from going to the police with her suspicions and then because he is plagued by guilt and a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> for her.|$|E
25|$|Soraya was 12 {{years old}} when her mother was first {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer, 18 when her mother had a recurrence, and 22 when her mother died in 1992. Soraya had said that her <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> increased because she needed {{to take care of}} her mother and do all the household chores. She would also accompany her mother to the doctor's office; together they did breast-cancer research and participated in the Race for the Cure.|$|E

25|$|Elinor Dashwood – the {{sensible}} and reserved eldest daughter of Mr and Mrs Henry Dashwood. She is 19 {{years old at}} the beginning of the book. She becomes attached to Edward Ferrars, the brother-in-law of her elder half-brother, John. Always feeling a keen <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> to her family and friends, she places their welfare and interests above her own, and suppresses her own strong emotions in a way that leads others to think she is indifferent or cold-hearted.|$|E
25|$|Children's {{motivation}} to learn is not solely influenced on {{their desire to}} belong but also their eagerness to see their community succeed. Children from Navajo communities were shown to {{have higher levels of}} social concern than Anglo American children in their schools. By having high levels of social concern the indigenous children are showing concern for not only their learning but also their peers', which serves as an example of their instilled <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> for their community. They wish to succeed as a united group rather than just themselves.|$|E
25|$|A {{substantial}} stride {{was taken}} {{in the direction of}} popular education in 1721, when King Frederick IV established 240 schoolhouses bearing the royal insignia and called them Cavalry schools after a division of the country into military districts. At the same time, the new religious movement of Pietism was spreading from Germany to Denmark. It aroused among church people a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> towards forthcoming generations and enjoyed royal support. A series of calls by the church for universal confirmation which could only be met by some degree of literacy, brought many new schools into existence. Thus, a limited kind of compulsory education was formally introduced.|$|E

25|$|Anne {{returned}} to Thorp Green in January 1843 where she secured a position for Branwell. He {{was to take}} over as tutor to the Robinsons' son, Edmund, who was growing {{too old to be}} in Anne's care. Branwell did not live in the house as Anne did. Anne's vaunted calm appears to have been the result of hard-fought battles, balancing deeply felt emotions with careful thought, a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> and resolute determination. All three Brontë sisters worked as governesses or teachers, and all experienced problems controlling their charges, gaining support from their employers, and coping with homesickness—but Anne {{was the only one who}} persevered and made a success of her work.|$|E
25|$|La Guardia was a domineering {{leader who}} verged on authoritarian but whose reform {{politics}} were carefully tailored {{to address the}} sentiments of his diverse constituency. He defeated a corrupt Democratic machine, presided during a depression and a world war, made the city the model for New Deal welfare and public works programs, and championed immigrants and ethnic minorities. He succeeded {{with the support of}} a sympathetic president. He secured his place in history as a tough-minded reform mayor who helped clean out corruption, brought in gifted experts, and fixed upon the city a broad <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> for its own citizens. His administration engaged new groups that had been kept out of the political system, gave New York its modern infrastructure, and raised expectations of new levels of urban possibility.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} Ngô Sĩ Liên praised Trần Thánh Tông {{as one of}} {{the finest}} emperors of the Trần dynasty. He was not only a righteous ruler but also a dutiful son, kind-hearted brother and father with <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> who was credited for the stability of both the royal family and the whole country. Thánh Tông's successful reign was the solid foundation for the long period of prosperity and peace in Đại Việt afterwards. Moreover, like his brother Trần Quang Khải, Trần Ích Tắc and Trần Nhật Duật, Trần Thánh Tông was a renowned scholar, Thánh Tông taught his princes by his own poems, and he also had a literary work named Di hậu lục. The Emperor was only criticized sometimes by Ngô Sĩ Liên, a Confucian historian, for his devotion for Buddhism, which was not suitable for a person in such a high position like him.|$|E
40|$|This study {{utilized}} {{data from}} the Multi-Institutional Study of Leadership (MSL) to explore the differences between college students involved with service, advocacy, and identity-based student organizations, {{as well as those}} not involved in any of these organizations, in their perceived <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> civic <b>responsibility,</b> as well as their frequency of engagement in social change behaviors. In addition, it explored the relationship between students' perceived <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> civic <b>responsibility</b> and their frequency of engagement in social change behaviors. The researcher utilized two one-way ANOVAs to see if there were significant differences in perceived <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> civic <b>responsibility</b> and frequency <b>of</b> engagement in social change behaviors among students who were involved exclusively in service, advocacy, or identity-based organizations, as well as students who were involved in a combination of these organizations, and students who did not participate in any of these organizations. The researcher found significant differences between students in the different organizations, with students in a combination of organizations and students involved exclusively in advocacy organizations having the highest mean scores on perceived <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> civic <b>responsibility</b> and frequency <b>of</b> engagement in social change behaviors. Students in identity-based organizations and those not involved in any of the organizations had the lowest mean scores on these two variables. In addition, the researcher found a positive, medium strength correlation between students' perceived <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> civic <b>responsibility</b> and frequency <b>of</b> engagement in social change behaviors among all of the involvement categories. Overall, this study provides important initial findings regarding the civic engagement characteristics of students involved in particular student organizations...|$|R
