5|$|In 1995, the Illinois state {{legislature}} passed the Chicago <b>School</b> <b>Reform</b> Act, {{which gave the}} Mayor of Chicago unprecedented new control over Chicago Public Schools. Daley asked Chico to become the CEO, but Chico declined because he was resuming his law career. Chico instead recommended that Daley appoint colleague Paul Vallas as CEO, and Chico was named chairman of the <b>School</b> <b>Reform</b> Board of Trustees. In 1997 Chico was named Outstanding School Board President by the Illinois State Board of Education for his reforms in education and fiscal policies.|$|E

40|$|Education yields {{substantial}} non-monetary benefits, but {{the size}} of these gains is still debated. Previous studies, for example, report contradictory effects of education and compulsory schooling on mortality - ranging from zero to large mortality reductions. Using data from 19 compulsory <b>schooling</b> <b>reforms</b> implemented in Europe during the twentieth century, we quantify the mean mortality effect and explore its dispersion across gender, time and countries. We find that men benefit from compulsory education both in the shorter and longer run. In contrast, compulsory <b>schooling</b> <b>reforms</b> {{have little or no}} effect on mortality for women...|$|R
40|$|Recognizing that {{academic}} competencies are fundamental to a productive society, American policymakers and educators have, since the landmark Brown (1954 - 55) school desegregation ruling, placed high priority on closing the racial achievement gap (RAG). At all government levels – federal, state, and local – successive waves of <b>school</b> <b>reforms</b> have funneled resources into within-school reforms. In so doing, {{the impact of}} broad ecological and biophysical influences on human development and learning have been virtually if not totally ignored. Therefore and similar to programming reforms since the 1950 s, the most recent federal initiative, No Child Left Behind (NCLB), is constructed on failed theoretical templates. The paper reviews <b>schooling</b> <b>reforms</b> upon which NCLB is based, {{in the context of}} the program’s continued political popularity which contrasts with failure to narrow the RAG. Future projections of American educational productivity, and the subsequent need for dramatic <b>school</b> <b>reforms,</b> are examined in the context of rapidly changing American demographics...|$|R

50|$|It {{is widely}} written that the <b>Reform</b> <b>School</b> for Boys in Westborough {{was the first}} {{juvenile}} <b>reform</b> <b>school</b> {{to be built in}} the United States.

25|$|Of special {{importance}} {{were the}} writings of Stanisław Konarski.

In his most important work O skutecznym rad sposobie (On an effective way of councils, 1760–63), he unveiled a far-reaching reform program for the Polish parliamentary system and political reorganization of the Commonwealth, which included aiding the monarch with a permanent governing council.|$|E
25|$|Bunn {{returned}} to politics in February 1998 {{to run for}} the non-partisan Oregon Superintendent of Public Instruction to replace the retiring Norma Paulus as head of the Oregon Department of Education. He was one of sixteen candidates in the May primary, finishing first and faced Democratic Senator Margaret Carter in a runoff in the November 1998 election. Bunn’s campaign focused on stabilizing funding for schools, continuing <b>school</b> <b>reform,</b> reducing class sizes, and supporting charter schools, but not school voucher programs. He spent over $100,000 of his own money in winning the position, defeating Carter 522,263 votes to 412,235 votes.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 2004-2005, {{the state}} {{launched}} the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The program requires that its taxpayer dollars {{are focused on}} specific interventions that {{are most likely to}} increase student academic achievement. These include teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size in K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, and before- or after-school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $367,720 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide intensive instruction for struggling students during the school day, to extend the school year, to provide after-school tutoring, and for high <b>school</b> <b>reform.</b>|$|E

25|$|Project 720 {{was a high}} <b>school</b> <b>reform</b> program {{implemented}} {{for three}} years under the Rendell administration. The intent was to increase academic rigor and improve the instruction of teachers in the Commonwealth’s high schools. Teachers were expected to use data driven instructional practices and {{to meet the needs}} of diverse learners. The 720 in the name referred to the number of days a student was in high school in ninth through 12th grades. High schools applied for funding and were required to agree to report to the PDE their plans, their actions and the outcomes. In 2007-08 budget year, the Commonwealth provided $11 million in funding. Lakeland School District was one of 161 PA public school districts to apply, receiving $171,000 funding over three years. For 2010-11, Project 720 funding was decreased to $1.7 million by Governor Rendell. The grant program was discontinued effective with the 2011-12 state budget.|$|E
25|$|The {{postulated}} by the Enlightenment thinkers {{social changes}} depended on an improved level and wider dissemination of education. The Theatines had few {{colleges in the}} Commonwealth, but theirs were the first attempts at <b>school</b> <b>reform</b> in the 1830s. In Lunéville, Lorraine, Stanisław Leszczyński established a corps of cadets, a school for the Polish and local nobility. The most crucial {{turned out to be}} the initiative of Stanisław Konarski. The young Piarist taught in schools conducted by his order, went to study and teach in Rome, and upon returning via France, Germany and Austria committed himself to pedagogic, scientific and publicist work. In 1740 he established the Collegium Nobilium in Warsaw, a high caliber secondary education institution for nobility youth. The school promoted civic duties through such means as debates and the school theater, for which he wrote a tragedy and where Voltaire's tragedies were shown. Despite many objections from the Jesuits and others, the trend set by the Collegium Nobillium was followed. In 1754 all the Piarist colleges were reformed and the Jesuit schools soon followed. New textbooks and teacher training methods were implemented. In the area of school theater Konarski's work was continued by Franciszek Bohomolec, who, revising the out of dated repertoire, wrote or adapted many comedies.|$|E
25|$|A {{second major}} {{educational}} issue which arose during Chavous' third term was {{another round of}} reform aimed at the D.C. Board of Education. On September 24, 2003, Mayor Williams announced that the city's public school system was so dysfunctional and provided such low-quality education that he was introducing legislation to strip the Board of nearly all its power. Control over the school system would {{be given to the}} mayor, who would have the right to hire and fire the superintendent, principals, teachers, and other workers and who would gain significant new powers to reconstitute programs, operations, curriculum, and schools. Although Chavous was working on his own bill to give the Council and mayor more power over the school system, he immediately threw his support behind Williams' plan. But little action on the mayor's plan had been taken by January 2004. Chavous argued that Williams had not been forceful enough in making the case for his proposal, and journalist Craig Timberg linked Chavous' lack of activity on the measure to a reluctance to take on a controversial issue in an election year. (Chavous' own bill was also delayed, and he said it would not be ready until at least March 2004.) Williams said he might seek a third term as mayor merely to fight for his <b>school</b> <b>reform</b> bill, if the council did not act more expeditiously. In February 2004, Chavous announced he no longer supported the mayor's bill. The school district was without a superintendent, and Chavous argued that no individual would want the job if the council was considering such a significant change to the position. He also said that giving the mayor hiring and firing authority over the superintendent would require congressional approval or a voter referendum, and both processes would take too long. Chavous then introduced a bill which largely undid the 2000 reforms. The new bill provided for a nine-member board, with eight elected members (one from each ward) and a president elected citywide. Chavous' committee approved the bill in April 2004 without a hearing. Although Mayor Williams submitted an altered form of his original proposal two weeks after the defeat, it was rejected in mid-May and the Chavous bill approved by the council in July on a close 7-to-6 vote.|$|E
