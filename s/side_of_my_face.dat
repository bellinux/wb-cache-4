60|$|I do {{not know}} how we managed to find the Bonaventure ranch. The wind had {{suddenly}} freshened almost to a gale, and, once clear of the river hollow, we met the full force of it. The snow that whirled across the desolate waste filled our eyes and nostrils, rendering breathing difficult and sight almost impossible; but {{it may be that the}} instinct of the horses helped us, for, making no effort at guidance, I trudged on, clinging to the bridle <b>of</b> <b>my</b> limping beast, while half-seen spectral objects floundered through the white haze on each side. Nevertheless, the pain which followed the impact of the flakes on one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> half-frozen <b>face</b> showed that we were at least progressing in a constant direction, and at last Trooper Cotton raised a hoarse halloo as a faint ray of light pierced the obscurity.

6000|$|More {{than once}} during my life, when recalling that episode, I have asked myself if I did right {{in taking the}} shepherd's advice?

It was only eighteen inches deep. But I hit it flat, and I hit it so hard that it must have cushioned me. I was the only survivor of my car. It struck forty feet away from me, off to the side. And they took only the dead out of it. When they took me out of the pool I wasn't dead by any means.

6000|$|The {{courtship}} {{between my}} parents occurred while {{my father was}} at home, to be cured of the wounds he had received in the engagement between the Trumbull and the Watt. I have always supposed this was the moving cause why my mother fancied that the grim-looking scar on the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>face</b> was so particularly becoming. The battle was fought in June 1780, and my parents were married {{in the autumn of}} the same year. My father did not go to sea again until after my birth, which took place the very day that Cornwallis capitulated at Yorktown. These combined events set the young sailor in motion, for he felt he had a family to provide for, and he wished to make one more mark on the enemy in return for the beauty-spot his wife so gloried in. He accordingly got a commission in a privateer, made two or three fortunate cruises, and was able at the peace to purchase a prize-brig, which he sailed, as master and owner, until the year 1790, when he was recalled to the paternal roof by the death <b>of</b> <b>my</b> grandfather. Being an only son, the captain, as my father was uniformly called, inherited the land, stock, utensils and crops, as already mentioned; while the six thousand pounds currency that were [...] "at use," [...] went to my two aunts, who were thought to be well married, to men in their own class of life, in adjacent counties.|$|R

6000|$|Monday, May 9. I {{should tell}} you that at the Duchess of Sutherland's an artist, named Burnard, {{presented}} me with a very fine cameo head of Wilberforce, cut from a statue in Westminster Abbey. He is from Cornwall, {{in the south of}} England, and has attained some celebrity as an artist. He wanted to take a bust of me; and though it always makes me laugh to think of having a new likeness, considering the melancholy results of all former enterprises, yet still I find myself easy to be entreated, in hopes, as Mr. Micawber says, that something may [...] "turn up," [...] though I fear the difficulty is radical in the subject. So I made an appointment with Mr. Burnard, and my very kind friend, Mr. B., in addition to all the other confusions I have occasioned in his mansion, consented to have his study turned into a studio. Upon the heels of this comes another sculptor, who has a bust begun, which he says is going to be finished in Parian, and published whether I sit for it or not, though, of course, he would much prefer {{to get a look at}} me now and then. Well, Mr. B. says he may come, too; so there you may imagine me in the study, perched upon a very high stool, dividing my glances between the two sculptors, one of whom, is taking one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and one the other.|$|E
6000|$|At last my turn came. A {{voice said}} [...] "Next!" [...] and I {{surrendered}} to--No. 2, of course. It always happens so. I said meekly that I {{was in a}} hurry, and it affected him as strongly {{as if he had}} never heard it. He shoved up my head, and put a napkin under it. He plowed his fingers into my collar and fixed a towel there. He explored my hair with his claws and suggested that it needed trimming. I said I did not want it trimmed. He explored again and said it was pretty long for the present style--better have a little taken off; it needed it behind especially. I said I had had it cut only a week before. He yearned over it reflectively a moment, and then asked with a disparaging manner, who cut it? I came back at him promptly with a [...] "You did!" [...] I had him there. Then he fell to stirring up his lather and regarding himself in the glass, stopping now and then to get close and examine his chin critically or inspect a pimple. Then he lathered one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> thoroughly, and was about to lather the other, when a dog-fight attracted his attention, and he ran to the window and stayed and saw it out, losing two shillings on the result in bets with the other barbers, a thing which gave me great satisfaction. He finished lathering, and then began to rub in the suds with his hand.|$|E
