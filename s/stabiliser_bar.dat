25|$|Proton {{also tested}} the Prevé in {{different}} weather and road conditions during its development phase such as ice & snow in Sweden {{as well as}} intense heat in Spain. The suspension system consists of MacPherson struts for the front and a multi-link with <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bar</b> for the rear. The Prevé's suspension was tuned by Proton's British subsidiary, Lotus for superior ride & handling attributes. The setup has also been developed specifically for the 205/55 GT Radial Champiro Bax 2 tyres equipped with the car for increased grip. All Proton Prevés are fitted with front and rear 15-inch disc brakes as well as 16-inch alloy rims.|$|E
500|$|MY10: {{versions}} of the VE were released in September 2009. New 3.0-litre and 3.6-litre V6s have been introduced, featuring Spark Ignition Direct Injection (SIDI) and coupled to a new six-speed automatic transmission (see above). These revised powertrains are marketed as part of Holden's EcoLine range. Visually, all SIDI versions are distinguished by relocated and additional EcoLine badging. 3.0-litre versions now utilise twin exhaust outlets. Updated cars also gain a recalibrated suspension setup and an extra ball-joint in the rear suspension (previously introduced on the Sportwagon); the result is increased tautness and improved handling in models fitted with 18 and 19-inch diameter wheels. These cars are also equipped with a larger [...] rear <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bar.</b> Additional engine bay sound deadening and a new muffler have resulted in reduced noise, vibration, and harshness. Elsewhere, the fitment of lighter low rolling-resistance tyres aids fuel consumption by minimising friction.|$|E
50|$|Front {{suspension}} Independent {{damper strut}} with anti-dive geometry and <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bar.</b> Separate shock absorbers and coil springs. Negative-offset steering.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} setup in the BH Persona, {{like the}} Iriz, consists of MacPherson struts with <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bars</b> {{at the front}} and torsion beam axles at the rear. In comparison, the CM Persona received MacPherson struts with <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bars</b> up front and more sophisticated multi-links at the back. Additionally, the BH has electric power steering (EPS) as opposed to hydraulic power steering in the CM. The EPS system is easier to steer at low speeds and helps improve fuel efficiency, but it comes {{at the expense of}} more engaging steering feedback.|$|R
50|$|The drivetrains of the TL/KL {{series for}} all models {{remained}} {{the same as that}} of the respective TJ/KJ Series 2 models, including those of the AWD and dedicated LPG models. The only difference consisted of rear <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bars</b> now fitted to all sedans.|$|R
50|$|ZF Friedrichshafen {{products}} include {{automatic and}} manual transmissions for cars, trucks, buses and construction equipment; chassis components (ball joints, tie rods, cross-axis joints, <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bars,</b> control arms); shock absorbers and suspension struts; electronic damping systems including Continuous Damping Control (CDC), Active Roll Stabilization (ARS); clutches; torque converters; differentials; axle drives; and industrial drives.|$|R
50|$|Rear {{suspension}} Independent 5-arm multilink with geometry for anti-lift, anti-squat and alignment {{control and}} <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bar.</b> Separate shock absorbers and coil springs.|$|E
50|$|Front {{suspension}} Independent damper struts {{with separate}} coil springs and gas-pressurised shock absorbers, triangular lower control arms with anti-dive geometry and <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The EMA 124 {{retained}} the Bell 47's dynamic components, tubular tail, and undercarriage, but was {{fitted with a}} new, more aerodynamic forward fuselage with a cabin to seat three. The fuel tank and engine installation were also [...] "cleaned up", and the rotor omitted the <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bars</b> fitted to the Bell 47's rotor.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{suspension}} {{was fitted}} to all Falcon and Fairmont models. The Falcon S lowered ride height by 26 mm and increased spring and shock rates with larger <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bars.</b> An optional Country Pack suspension offered increased ride height {{compared to the}} standard suspension and typically came with enhanced underbody protection including a sump guard.|$|R
5000|$|A few {{models of}} single-shot [...]22 calibre free pistol, {{as used in}} the 50 m Olympic 'Free Pistol' match, have been {{produced}} to meet the [...] "long-barrelled pistol" [...] conditions. Some free pistols have removable <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bars</b> extending backwards to improve stability; the UK-legal models have been made with non-removable stabilisers to extend the dimensions, instead of contrived and non-functional grip extensions. Examples are the single-shot Pardini K22 Longarm and the Westlake Britarms Long Pistol, a permitted [...]22 LR five-shot semi-automatic pistol.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{configuration of}} the Arena consists {{of a combination of}} independent MacPherson strut suspensions from a saloon car at the front, and torsion beam, leaf sprung suspensions at the rear. Other modifications include the use of a rigid rear axle, an uprated front <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bar,</b> and 14" [...] front ventilated discs and 9" [...] rear drum brakes with load sensing proportioning valves (LSPV), optimised weight distribution and the use of reinforced high profile tyres. Lotus Engineering provided additional ride and handling enhancements.|$|E

50|$|The VJ Valiant models {{featured}} new grilles, round headlights {{and revised}} tail lights, along with improved trim {{and a larger}} range of colours. A new electronic ignition system was introduced on some models, {{the first time that}} this feature had been offered in an Australian built car. The total number of models offered was significantly reduced with Ranger XL, Hemi Pacer, Regal 770 and Charger R/T not carried across from the VH Valiant into the new series. Equipment levels were raised in July 1974 with power assisted front brakes, retractable front safety belts, improved sound deadening, a lockable glovebox and a front <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bar</b> now available on all models other than the utilities.|$|E
5000|$|The UZZ32 {{was the top}} of {{the line}} 30 series, {{featuring}} all of the options available on the UZZ31 and the addition of four-wheel steering and a complex, computer-controlled hydraulic Toyota Active Control Suspension. This did away with conventional springs and anti-roll (<b>stabiliser)</b> <b>bars</b> in favour of hydraulic struts controlled by an array of sensors (such as yaw velocity sensors, vertical G sensors, height sensors, wheel speed sensors, longitudinal and lateral G sensors) that detected cornering, acceleration and braking forces.|$|R
50|$|It was {{a complex}} hydropneumatic, {{computer-controlled}} active suspension system. This {{did away with}} conventional springs and anti-roll (<b>stabiliser)</b> <b>bars</b> in favour of hydraulic struts controlled by an array of sensors (such as yaw velocity sensors, vertical G sensors, height sensors, wheel speed sensors, longitudinal and lateral G sensors) that detected cornering, acceleration and braking forces. The system worked well and gave an unusually controlled yet smooth ride with no body roll. However, the additional weight and power requirements of the system affected straight-line performance somewhat.|$|R
50|$|Compared to the Galant, {{there were}} changes to 70 {{percent of the}} car to create a car more suited to the Australian market. Roads, {{legislation}} and consumer preferences were all driving forces behind the changes. The rear of the floorpan had to be overhauled to accommodate a full-sized spare wheel, and superior rear side members were required to improve towing capabilities. Body rigidity was also improved to deal with Australian road conditions. The improved body stiffness resulted in better vehicle dynamics, which were also supported through the use of sophisticated suspension designs, new shock absorbers and <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
50|$|The FE {{models were}} {{built on a}} longer {{wheelbase}} than the FJ series Holdens which they replaced and they featured totally different styling, the FJ models having used a body shape carried over from the original Holden 48-215 series introduced in 1948. A single piece windscreen was now fitted and other improvements included a 12 volt electrical system (replacing the previous 6 volt system), improved steering, a front <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bar</b> and wider wheel rims. All models used a 2262 cc in-line six cylinder engine, coupled with a 3 speed manual gearbox. Engine improvements over the FJ included the use of bigger valves and {{the lifting of the}} compression ratio to 6.8:1, which increased the power output from 45 kW (60 hp) to 53 kW (71 hp).|$|E
50|$|The GTS {{of early}} 1990 was a limited run of 510 units for the New Zealand market. Powered by the base 3.8-Litre V6 engine {{it was based}} on the Executive model but {{featured}} upgrades including a body kit, 5-spoke alloy wheels and FE2 sports suspension (with upgraded springs and <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bar</b> for the front end and gas filled shocks absorbers at the back), larger front brake discs and master brake cylinder. The front suspension geometry was also modified to lower ride height by 35 mm for improved road handling. Inside, the car had power windows, central locking, electric antenna and four speaker radio cassette sound system. Suggested retail was $35,995 GTS and $37,295 GTS for the manual and automatic versions, respectively. It was available painted Vivid White or GTS Blue metallic (in Australia, Alpine White or Imperial Blue).|$|E
50|$|The Suprima S borrows {{most of its}} ride & {{handling}} attributes {{from the}} Prevé, which was tested in various weather and road conditions during its development phase such as ice & snow in Sweden as well as intense heat in Spain. The suspension system consists of MacPherson struts for the front and a multi-link with <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bar</b> for the rear. The suspension setup, {{the result of a}} retune of the Prevé's was wholly done in-house by the local Ride & Handling team, and was subsequently approved by Proton's British sister company, Lotus during a short joint-test with the testing team. Unlike the Prevé, the Suprima S displays a Lotus Ride & Handling badge on the bootlid, whereas in the former, no such badging is offered, but Proton Ride & Handling is nonetheless used in the Prevé's promotional media.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} setup in {{the third}} generation Saga, like the FLX previously, consists of MacPherson struts with <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bars</b> at the front and torsion beam axles at the rear. However, Proton has fitted new springs and dampers, {{as well as a}} new strut bar in the engine bay for improved handling and control. Proton has also lowered the steering ratio to 16:1 from 20:1 previously, and reduced the steering effort to 2.75 kgf from 3.0 kgf. The steering rack angle is now steeper and allows for a tighter turning radius of 5.1 m compared to 5.3 m previously.|$|R
5000|$|The 1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500 saw {{the first}} of the Ford Falcon GT-HOs. This Phase One GT-HO Bathurst special Falcon was powered by a 351 cubic inch V8 sourced from Ford America. It's 'HO' {{specification}} included upgraded suspension components such as front and rear <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bars.</b> At Bathurst it was fitted with race tyres. Holden upgraded the GTS 327 Monaro to the GTS 350, which included better race-style handling and a more powerful Chevrolet V8 engine of 350 cubic inches. The new GTS 350 Monaro, in the hands of Colin Bond and Tony Roberts, was able to hold out Ford to claim the second victory for Holden. In 1969 there was a multi-car accident on lap one. After the first 10 cars passed through The Esses, contact between two Falcons caused one to roll over. Several cars coming around the blind corner crashed into the stationary car. The track was almost blocked with wreckage but expert flag marshalling enabled the cars to pass through in single file until the debris was cleared. The race was a disaster for Ford as many Falcon tyres failed due to the speed and weight of the Falcons. Ford even a ran a post race advertising campaign using the slogan [...] "we were a little deflated".|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the quality}} control the {{resistance}} of newly produced LHC main bus bar splices is now routinely measured at room temperature (RT) in order to conclude on the electrical continuity of the bus <b>bar</b> <b>stabiliser</b> across the splice under operating conditions. In this note we present splice resistance measurements that have been performed at RT and in liquid nitrogen (LN) in the CERN Cryolab with “ideal” splices (represented by continuous dipole and quadrupole bus bars), and with dipole and quadrupole splices with different defects, which cause an additional RT splice resistance of up to 60 µΩ. The RT resistance (RRT) results obtained with the Cryolab set-up are compared to the calculated resistance values and with the so-called R- 8 and R- 16 resistance results, as they are measured in the LHC tunnel with a Digital Low Resistance Ohmmeter with a voltage tap distance of 8 cm or 16 cm. The RT to LN resistance ratio has been determined for all splices in order to study {{the influence of the}} resistance of the splice contact surfaces on the overall splice resistance...|$|R

5000|$|Overall, the VT {{series was}} {{regarded}} a more neutral handler {{compared to the}} previous VS (with the front MacPherson strut suspension featuring 8 degrees of positive castor, from the VS series' 5.5) and most cars ran a 26 mm <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bar</b> at the front, while the V8s with standard tyres and stiffer FE2 suspension tune (with 15 percent stiffer springs and firmer dampers for the Commodore SS) had a 25 mm stabilizer bar. [...] At the rear, the V6 models had a 15 mm stabilizer bar, the V6 Supercharged a 16mm, and the V8s a 17mm bar. A standard three-channel Bosch 5.3 anti-lock braking system (ABS) was fitted across the range, with front discs measuring 296 mm in diameter (and 28 mm thickness), while the rear's respective sizes were 286 and 16 mm. Tyre sizes varied from 15-inch P205/65 for the Commodore Executive, Acclaim and Berlina (the latter, and following models, with alloy wheels), to 16-inch P215/60 for the Calais and P225/50 for the Commodore S, and the largest P235/45 on 17-inch wheels for the Commodore SS.|$|E
50|$|In early 1990, Porsche {{engineers}} {{began working}} on what they had intended to be the third evolution of the 944, the S3. As they progressed with the development process, they realized that so many parts were being changed that they had produced an almost entirely new vehicle. Porsche consequently shifted development from the 944 S/S2 to the car that would replace the 944 entirely, the 968. The 944's final year of production was 1991 with over 4,000 cars built and sold. In 1992 the 968 debuted and was sold alongside the 928 through 1995, when both water-cooled front engine models were discontinued.In February 1992 verbal agreement was given to Porsche UK from Stuttgart {{for the production of}} a prototype “Sports Equipment” 944S2 Model with following approval to construct 15 vehicles for the UK market from the last 944S2 Coupes produced. A unique 30mm lower fully adjustable Koni Suspension with Turbo rated springs was used in combination with upgraded 31mm front <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bar</b> & adjustable rear bar. Engine output was increased to 225BHP with re-map to improve Torque above 4,250rpm and unique sports exhaust system. Cosmetically the “SE” was fitted with Porsche colour matched “Porsche Sport” steering wheel, Bi-plane rear spoiler, SE side decals and rear badging. The modifications resulted in improved acceleration in higher rev range, flatter cornering, more precise steering, improved responsiveness, confidence inspiring handling leading to an overall sharper response. The 944S2 SE prototypes are regarded as the inspiration and in part development for the later 968 Club Sport.|$|E
40|$|Pectus excavatum is a {{congenital}} deformity that can require surgical treatment. Since Nuss proposed a correction technique, several modifications {{have been proposed}} {{in order to achieve}} more safety and efficiency in the placement and removal of both bars. Our objective is to describe the technique of placing and removing the bars by proposing three technical modifications: two in bar placement and one in the bar removal. We describe two cases where Nuss bars were placed and one case where the bar was removed as per the technical modification proposed herein. According to the original technique, <b>bar</b> <b>stabilisers.</b> were placed close to the lateral bar edges. We propose a more medial position in order to reduce <b>bar</b> displacement. New <b>stabilisers</b> were designed with central grooves in the posterior surface, which allow better sliding. The technical modification suitable for bar removal was the use of a protective film around the bars to protect the surrounding tissues from the sharp edges, and thereby minimise the risk of injuries. All the proposed modifications were performed without any additional surgical risk or perioperative complication. These three technical modifications can be easily and safety performed, and seem {{to reduce the risk of}} bleeding with no additional perioperative complications.

40|$|Rotor blade {{feathering}} moments {{caused by}} the gyroscopic forces acting during helicopter pitching and rolling motions are identified. The consequent blade elastic feathering motion incurred by these moments are shown to give rise to blade flapping which reduces the pitch/roll cross-coupling due to the aerodynamic effects of pitch and roll motions. For blades of low feathering stiffness this reduction is considerable. Inclusion of this effect into rotor analysis can account {{for much of the}} difference between calculated cross-coupling and observed flight behaviour. This suggests that 'dynamic inflow' or other effects introduced to explain these discrepancies, should be re-evaluated. The 'Bell Bar' rotor system is reviewed and it is shown that the <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bar</b> may be considered {{as an extension of the}} rotor blade, and gyroscopic feathering moments are a fundamental reason for its operation as a beneficial influence on helicopter flight behaviour...|$|E

However, while many benefits of Six Sigma are increasingly reported in other country, it is not very common among local company because lack of exposure and many companies in Malaysia afraid to take a high risk. Furthermore, although there have been numerous case studies, comprehensive discussions, books and websites addressing Six Sigma, a very little academic research has been done to examine the impact of the Six Sigma application in local industry. This project has been created to design a systematic project which will overcome the problem of low quality of the <b>stabiliser</b> <b>bar</b> due to the some problems at forging process at Company A, and the benefits to the companies that implementing Six Sigma application.
