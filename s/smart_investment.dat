50|$|As stated above, the sex {{ratios of}} a {{province}} are largely {{determined by the}} type of restriction placed upon the family, pointing to the conclusion that much of the imbalance in sex ratio in China {{can be attributed to the}} policy. Research by Junhong (2001) found that many parents are willing to pay to ensure that their child is male (especially if their first child is female), but will not do the same to ensure their child is female. Likely, fear of the harsh monetary punishments of the One-Child Policy make ensuring a son’s birth a <b>smart</b> <b>investment.</b> Therefore, son’s cultural and economic importance to families and the large expenses associated with multiple children are primary factors leading to China’s disparate sex ratio.|$|E
50|$|Established since 1988, the {{organization}} is committed to ridding the blight from the Motor City. Blight Busters started with Angels' Night patrol where citizens patrolled the night before Halloween to protect neighborhoods from arson and vandalism. John J. George {{is the founder and}} leader of the Motor City Blight Busters. Besides Angel’s Night, John George’s first action in forming Blight Busters was buying plywood and boarding up a house that was being used as an operations base by drug dealers around the corner from his house. After it was boarded up, he found that this worked because the drug dealers did not return to that location. When they first started, John George only had a Lincoln Town Car, but now has made a <b>smart</b> <b>investment,</b> and bought a full-size pickup truck. Blight Busters did not just appear; plenty of work was spent in creating this organization. It started off in John George’s basement with a couple of volunteers. Once it grew too big for his basement, they purchased a building on Lahser Road for one dollar. They put 1.4 million dollars into turning the place around, and making it the headquarters for the Blight Busters.|$|E

While many innovations and products have been created to address this Global Water Crisis, no comparisons have been done as to which innovations and products are the best overall choice for philanthropic investment.

The study examined fifteen innovations and products, targeted to address the three crises to determine which innovation in each group is the overall <b>smart</b> <b>investment.</b> Pulse tool was used to create reports of data comparing the innovations and products to one another. Findings concluded that the Hippo Roller is the <b>smart</b> <b>investment</b> for transportation of water, the Treadle Pump is the <b>smart</b> <b>investment</b> for gaining access to water, and the Filtron and the Mobile MaxPure are the equally smart investments for sanitizing water.
