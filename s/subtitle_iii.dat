40|$|Watching a subtitled foreign film {{changes the}} way verbal {{information}} is presented {{and how we}} acquire it. Which are the implications for the acquisition and processing of visual and verbal information from a film scene when subtitles are present? To address this question we carried out an eye-tracking experiment. Participants watched a series of clips from an animated film. The task was to remember as much visual and verbal information as possible. Clips were presented in four different conditions {{in order to test}} the effect of presenting subtitles on the visual and verbal recall: (i) participants own language—no subtitles, (ii) participants own language—foreign language <b>subtitles,</b> (<b>iii)</b> foreign language—no <b>subtitles,</b> and (iv) foreign language—participants own language subtitles. Immediately after each clip, participants performed an oral free memory recall task and they answered a questionnaire about verbal information from the dialogues and visual information from elements showed in the clip. Scores from questionnaires and eye-movement data from areas of interest were later analysed. We observed that the presence of subtitles affects correct recall and eye movements. We discuss this effect as a function of verbal information presentation mode and subtitle’s language...|$|R

40|$|We {{assess the}} {{performance}} of generic text summarization algorithms applied to films and documentaries, using the well-known behavior of summarization of news articles as reference. We use three datasets: (i) news articles, (ii) film scripts and <b>subtitles,</b> and (<b>iii)</b> documentary <b>subtitles.</b> Standard ROUGE metrics are used for comparing generated summaries against news abstracts, plot summaries, and synopses. We show that the best performing algorithms are LSA, for news articles and documentaries, and LexRank and Support Sets, for films. Despite the different nature of films and documentaries, their relative behavior is in accordance with that obtained for news articles.

In this, the different bulbs being affected by the standards changes are first defined. Along with higher standards being created for bulbs, the ballasts are also required to increase efficiency. It is also outlined within EISA 2007 that there are lighting requirements within public buildings. The General Services Administration (GSA) set minimum energy efficiency standards for leased spaces, which includes energy efficient lighting fixtures and bulbs, {{including the use of}} Energy Star and Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) designated products.|$|R
5000|$|Hill told Fangoria {{that the}} film was {{supposed}} to be [...] "a pod movie, not a knife movie." [...] As such, Wallace drew inspiration from another pod film: Don Siegels Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956). The fictional town of Santa Mira was originally the setting of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and named as such in Halloween III as an homage to Siegels film. Aspects of the plot proved very similar as well, such as the [...] "snatching" [...] bodies and replacing them with androids. Halloween <b>IIIs</b> <b>subtitle</b> comes from George A. Romeros second film Season of the Witch (1973)—also known as Hungry Wives—but the plot contains no similarity to Romeros story of a housewife who becomes involved in witchcraft.|$|R

5000|$|Reigeluth is {{best known}} for his three edited volumes on Instructional-Design Theories and Models, which provide {{descriptions}} of a wide variety of instructional-design theories by the creators of those theories, along with chapters by Reigeluth on the nature of instructional-design theories and the theory-building process. Design theories are different from descriptive theories in that they are goal oriented, offering guidance about which methods should be used to achieve different kinds of goals in different situations - what Herbert Simon referred to as a [...] "design science". [...] These three volumes have several uncommon elements, including a foreword for every theory chapter that outlines the theory’s goals, values, and methods, and editor’s notes that compare aspects of each theory with other theories. Volume I, subtitled An Overview of their Current Status, was published in 1983. Volume II, subtitled A New Paradigm of Instructional Theory, was published in 1999. And Volume <b>III,</b> <b>subtitled</b> Building a Common Knowledge Base, was published in 2009. Reigeluth asserted that the primary goal of instructional design is enhancing human learning and development (1999, p. ix).|$|R
5000|$|In 1976, the March of Dimes {{published}} a report titled Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy (TIOP), and in 1993 they published Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy: The 90s and Beyond (TIOP II). TIOP [...] "stratified maternal and neonatal care into 3 levels of complexity and recommended referral of high-risk patients to centers with the personnel and resources needed for {{their degree of}} risk and severity of illness." [...] TIOP was published when [...] "resources for the most complex care were relatively scarce and concentrated in academic medical centers." [...] TIOP II updated care complexity designations from levels I, II and III to basic, specialty and subspecialty, and the criteria were expanded. In 2001, the March of Dimes introduced a family support program for those with babies in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The program seeks to educate NICU staff to communicate effectively with patients' families. The March of Dimes hosted the Symposium on Quality Improvement to Prevent Prematurity in October 2009.
