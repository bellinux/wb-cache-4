40|$|Background: Cervical {{auscultation}} (CA) is an affordable, {{non-invasive technique}} used to observe sounds occurring during <b>swallowing.</b> CA involves <b>swallowing</b> characterization via stethoscopes or microphones, while accelerometers can detect other vibratory signals. While {{the effects of}} fluid viscosity on <b>swallowing</b> accelerometry signals is well understood, there are still open questions about these effects on <b>swallowing</b> sounds. Therefore, this study investigated the influence of fluids with increasing thickness on <b>swallowing</b> sound characteristics. Method: We collected <b>swallowing</b> sounds and <b>swallowing</b> accelerometry signals from 56 healthy participants. Each participant completed five water <b>swallows,</b> five <b>swallows</b> of nectar-thick apple juice, and five <b>swallows</b> of honey-thick apple juice. These <b>swallows</b> were completed in neutral head and chin-tuck head positions. After pre-processing of collected signals, a number of features in time, frequency and time-frequency domains were extracted. Results: Our numerical analysis demonstrated that significant influence of viscosity was found {{in most of the}} features. In general, features extracted from <b>swallows</b> in the neutral head position were affected more than <b>swallows</b> from the chin-tuck position. Furthermore, most of the differences were found between water and fluids with higher viscosity. Almost {{no significant differences were found}} between <b>swallows</b> involving nectar-thick and honey-thick apple juices. Our results also showed that thicker fluids had higher acoustic regularity and predictability as demonstrated by the information-theoretic features, and a lower frequency content as demonstrated by features in the frequency domain. Conclusions: According to these results, we can conclude that viscosity of fluids should be considered in future investigations involving <b>swallowing</b> sounds. © 2013 Jestrovićet al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: The primary {{motor cortex}} (M 1) {{controls}} voluntary motor behaviours. M 1 {{has been identified}} {{to play a major}} role in the execution of voluntary corticospinal tasks as well as self-initiated corticobulbar tasks. However, the involvement of M 1 in more complex corticubulbar tasks, such as <b>swallowing,</b> is not yet fully understood. <b>Swallowing</b> is quite different from other voluntary motor tasks as it has both voluntary and reflexive components. The degree of M 1 involvement in the pharyngeal, or more reflexive, component of <b>swallowing</b> is unclear. Studies investigating the role of M 1 in <b>swallowing</b> have yielded contradictory findings regarding the specific functional contribution of M 1 to <b>swallowing.</b> Therefore, further investigation is warranted to clarify the role of M 1 in pharyngeal <b>swallowing.</b> Discrete saliva or water <b>swallowing</b> has been utilized in most studies investigating neurophysiology of <b>swallowing</b> in health and disease. However, individuals most frequently complete multiple, consecutive <b>swallows</b> during the ingestion of liquid. Biomechanical differences between discrete and continuous water <b>swallows</b> have been identified using videofluoroscopic <b>swallowing</b> study (VFSS). However, no studies have investigated the pharyngeal pressure differences between these two <b>swallowing</b> tasks. Additional insights into task differences may be revealed through evaluation of pharyngeal pressure utilizing pharyngeal manometry. This research programme sought to clarify the role of M 1 in reflexively and volitionally initiated pharyngeal <b>swallowing.</b> In order to understand M 1 involvement in the execution of <b>swallowing,</b> comparative tasks that require known dependence on M 1 were also included in this research programme. This research programme addressed the biomechanical changes in motor behaviours as a result of neural disruption during the performance of a number of motor tasks. This neural disruption was intrinsically generated through application of dual task (DT) paradigm and extrinsically generated using single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). A secondary aim of this research programme was to identify the differences in pharyngeal pressure generation between discrete and continuous <b>swallowing.</b> Methods: Twenty-four right handed participants (12 males, average age= 24. 4, SD= 6. 3) were recruited to this research programme. A number of motor tasks that vary in complexity were tested. These tasks included: volitional <b>swallowing,</b> reflexive <b>swallowing,</b> eyebrow movement, jaw movement and finger tapping with right, left, or bilateral index fingers. Participants performed multiple trials of several tasks in each study. Repetitions of tasks during a single session may affect performance due to factors such as fatigue or practice. A baseline study was undertaken to determine within-participant variability of measures across repeated trials. Following the baseline study, the role of M 1 in pharyngeal <b>swallowing</b> was investigated in two main studies in counter balanced order. The role of M 1 in pharyngeal <b>swallowing</b> was evaluated by investigating <b>swallowing</b> parameters during neural disruption using a DT paradigm. Participants performed tasks in isolation (baseline) and with interference that consisted of pairing <b>swallowing</b> with comparative task that activates M 1 (fingers tapping and eyebrow movement tasks). In the other study, single pulse TMS was utilized to create an electrophysiological disruption to the areas of M 1 associated with muscular representation of a number of motor behaviours (<b>swallowing</b> tasks, jaw movement and fingers tapping tasks). Stimulation was provided to both hemispheres in random order to evaluate laterality effects. <b>Swallowing</b> parameters and the performance of the other motor tasks were evaluated when performed with and without electrophysiological disruption. Differences in pharyngeal pressure generation between discrete and continuous <b>swallowing</b> were investigated using pharyngeal manometry. Pharyngeal pressures were recorded at three locations: upper pharynx, mid-pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter (UES) during four <b>swallowing</b> types: discrete saliva <b>swallowing,</b> discrete 10 ml <b>swallowing,</b> volitional continuous <b>swallowing,</b> and reflexive continuous <b>swallowing.</b> The research paradigm used in this research programme identified the effect of experimental conditions on the rate and regularity of task performance. In addition, pharyngeal manometry was utilised to measure the effect of experimental conditions on the pattern of the pharyngeal pressure generation during <b>swallowing.</b> Within subject differences from baseline were identified by means of Repeated Measures Analyses of Variance (RM-ANOVA). Results: Initial analysis of the data revealed that repetition of tasks within a session did not affect the rate and regularity of voluntary corticospinal tasks, voluntary corticiobulbar tasks nor <b>swallowing</b> tasks. In addition, repeating the <b>swallowing</b> tasks during a session did not affect pharyngeal pressure as measured by pharyngeal manometry. When motor tasks were performed concurrently in the DT paradigm, rate and regularity of eyebrow movements were significantly decreased when paired with <b>swallowing</b> tasks, whereas rate and regularity of <b>swallowing</b> were significantly decreased when paired with left finger tapping, but not right finger tapping. However, there was no significant effect of any task on the pattern of pharyngeal pressure generation. Extrinsically generated disruption using TMS significantly reduced rate and regularity of finger tapping tasks and regularity of jaw movement and <b>swallowing</b> tasks. In addition, interruption of pharyngeal M 1 during the volitional <b>swallowing</b> task produced significant increase in the duration but not the amplitude of the pharyngeal pressure. Pharyngeal pressure generation differed between <b>swallowing</b> types and boluses types, in that saliva <b>swallowing</b> produced longer pharyngeal pressure duration and lower nadir pressure than water <b>swallows.</b> Discrete water bolus <b>swallowing</b> produced longer UES opening compared to both saliva <b>swallowing</b> or continuous water <b>swallowing.</b> Conclusion: The results of this research programme provided valuable methodological information regarding the effect of trials on task performance as well as identifying pharyngeal pressure differences between discrete and continuous <b>swallowing.</b> In addition to the methodological contribution, this research programme expanded on previous knowledge of neural control of <b>swallowing,</b> in that it extended the findings regarding potential role of M 1 in pharyngeal <b>swallowing.</b> Given the absent effect of task repetition on the performance of corticospinal and corticobulbar motor tasks, it is speculated that outcomes of research investigating the effect of experimental manipulation on motor tasks performance is due to the experimental tasks, rather than natural variance in the data. The effect of <b>swallowing</b> on the rate and regularity of eyebrow movement, when performed concurrently using DT paradigm, suggest bilateral functional overlapping to a significant degree between neural substrates that control <b>swallowing</b> and orofacial muscles. These results offer partial support of bilateral representation of <b>swallowing</b> in the cortex. In addition, results further revealed potential involvement of right M 1 in the regulation of pharyngeal <b>swallowing</b> as evidenced by a disruptive effect of left finger tapping on the rate and regularity of <b>swallowing.</b> The results from the hemispheric TMS disruption study support the active involvement M 1 in the execution of voluntary corticospinal and corticobulbar motor tasks. In addition, the current findings extended previous knowledge of neural control of pharyngeal <b>swallowing</b> by documenting the effect of neural disruption on the regularity and pharyngeal pressure measures during volitional and reflexive <b>swallowing.</b> The current programme documented potential role of M 1 in the control of pharyngeal <b>swallowing</b> possibly by modulating the motor plan at the <b>swallowing</b> CPG in the brainstem. This project is the first to document pharyngeal pressure differences between discrete and continuous <b>swallowing.</b> These findings contribute valuable information to the <b>swallowing</b> literature as limited number of studies investigated the biomechanical differences between discrete and continuous liquid ingestion. This knowledge will assist clinicians and researchers in identifying the pharyngeal pressure differences between normal and abnormal <b>swallowing</b> in different <b>swallowing</b> types and ultimately guide their rehabilitation decisions. Data from this research programme will add to the existing knowledge of neurophysiology of <b>swallowing,</b> thereby facilitating understanding of <b>swallowing</b> pathophysiology which is crucial for appropriate management of <b>swallowing</b> disorders...|$|R

Key Results <b>Swallows</b> were in all cases (100 %) proceded by expiration and 98 % were also followed by expiration, regardless of body position, bolus type, or respiratory drive. While the endpoint of postswallow apnea correlated well to the endpoint of pharyngeal <b>swallowing,</b> duration of preswallow apnea was highly variable. In {{a small fraction of}} <b>swallows</b> followed by inspiration (3 %), the expiratory phase before <b>swallowing</b> and duration of postswallow apnea was significantly longer.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{contribution}} to the understanding of how rheological properties of a fluid influences <b>swallowing,</b> especially people suffering from <b>swallowing</b> disorders (dysphagia). Our hypothesis was that fluid elasticity contributes to safe and pleasant <b>swallowing.</b> In the present study three food grade model fluids with specific rheological properties were developed and used: a Newtonian fluid with constant shear viscosity, an elastic Boger fluid with constant shear viscosity and a shear-thinning fluid which was elastic and had rate dependent shear viscosity. By comparing the <b>swallowing</b> of these model fluids the specific rheological effects could be distinguished. Sensory analysis of the perceived ease of <b>swallowing</b> was performed by a panel of healthy individuals, and by a group of dysphagic patients.
