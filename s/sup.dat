25|$|Another infinitary class {{intermediate}} between Boolean algebras {{and complete}} Boolean algebras {{is the notion}} of a sigma-algebra. This is defined analogously to complete Boolean algebras, but with <b>sups</b> and infs limited to countable arity. That is, a sigma-algebra is a Boolean algebra with all countable <b>sups</b> and infs. Because the <b>sups</b> and infs are of bounded cardinality, unlike the situation with complete Boolean algebras, the Gaifman-Hales result does not apply and free sigma-algebras do exist. Unlike the situation with CABAs however, the free countably generated sigma algebra is not a power set algebra.|$|R
25|$|A <b>sup</b> (supremum) of X is a least {{upper bound}} on X, namely an upper bound on X that is less or equal to every upper bound on X. Dually an inf (infimum) of X is a {{greatest}} lower bound on X. The <b>sup</b> of x and y always exists in the underlying poset of a Boolean algebra, being x∨y, and likewise their inf exists, namely x∧y. The empty <b>sup</b> is 0 (the bottom element) and the empty inf is 1 (top). It follows that every finite set has both a <b>sup</b> and an inf. Infinite subsets of a Boolean algebra {{may or may not}} have a <b>sup</b> and/or an inf; in a power set algebra they always do.|$|E
25|$|If we further {{consider}} both spaces {{with the}} <b>sup</b> norm the extension map becomes an isometry. Indeed, {{if in the}} construction above we take the smallest possible ball B, {{we see that the}} <b>sup</b> norm of the extended sequence does not grow (although the image of the extended function can be bigger).|$|E

25|$|Any poset (B,≤) {{such that}} every pair x,y of {{elements}} has both a <b>sup</b> and an inf {{is called a}} lattice. We write x∨y for the <b>sup</b> and x∧y for the inf. The underlying poset of a Boolean algebra always forms a lattice. The lattice {{is said to be}} distributive when x∧(y∨z)= (x∧y)∨(x∧z), or equivalently when x∨(y∧z)= (x∨y)∧(x∨z), since either law implies the other in a lattice. These are laws of Boolean algebra whence the underlying poset of a Boolean algebra forms a distributive lattice.|$|E
