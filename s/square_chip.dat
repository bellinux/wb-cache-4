We assume a mesh structure with uniform communication demand for communication. A multi-commodity flow (MCF) model is proposed to find the throughput for several different routing architectures.

The throughput is limited by the capacity of the middle row and column in the mesh, simply enlarging the congested channel cannot produce better throughput.

It was discovered that the <b>square</b> <b>chip</b> contributes to the highest increase in the polymer stiffness, but significantly reduces its ductility. The 4 mm^² circle causes the smallest disruption in the polymer integrity, especially when including multiple chips and when there is no adhesion.

One challenge, however, has been a simple integration of optical waveguides with the fluidic channel. We employ the use of femtosecond laser-writing process to pattern a waveguide in the bulk of a fused-silica glass substrate housing a fluidic channel. We demonstrate an in-situ scheme for detecting sub-millimeter components based on such a monolithically fabricated device. By illuminating the waveguide and collecting the light signal past the channel, we detect opaque and transparent components between 300 - 500 µm in size, as each moves along the channel. Both an opaque <b>square</b> <b>chip</b> and a transparent bead attentuate the signal by more than 95 % primarily due to reflection and refraction respectively. The signature of a transparent bead additionally shows attenuated peaks which we attribute to normal incidence of light from the waveguide.

We conclude that the femtosecond laser produced waveguides in fused-silica glass are a viable option for the detection of certain kinds of sub-millimeter components.

For small shifts, it is found that the restoring force does not depend on the shift direction or on the polygonal shape. In order to tackle the problem of microsystem packaging, an extension of the theory is done for polygonal shapes pierced with connection vias (channels), and a closed form of the shift-restoring force is derived for these geometries and again checked against the numerical model. In this case, the restoring force depends on the shift direction. Finally, a non-dimensional number, the shift number, is proposed that indicates the isotropic or anisotropic behavior of the chip according to the shift direction...|$|E

To evaluate the efficiency of different interconnect architectures, we assume mesh structures with uniform communication demand and develop a multi-commodity flow (MCF) approach to model the on-chip communication traffic. We also extend the combinatorial MCF algorithm in [5] to compute the optimal routing resource allocations for different interconnect architectures. The experiments show that: (1) Compared with Manhattan architecture, the Y-architecture demonstrates a throughput improvement of 24. 1 % for <b>square</b> <b>chip.</b> The throughput of the Y-architecture is only 7. 73 % smaller than that of X-architecture.

An evaluation of the reliability of a new Wafer-Level Chip Scale Package (WL-CSP) was done in the FIP program, a joint development program between Fraunhofer IZM and Motorola. As a CSP the FIP-CSP eliminates underfill operation during flip-chip bonding using high through-put SMT assembly lines.

40|$|Flip chip is {{the main}} {{component}} of a RFID tag. It is used in billions each year in electronic packaging industries because of its small size, high performance and reliability as well as low cost. They are used in microprocessors, cell phones, watches and automobiles. RFID tags are applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for identification and tracking using radio waves. Some tags can be read from several meters away or even beyond the line of sight of the reader. Passive RFID tags are the most common type in use that employ external power source to transmit signals. Joining chips by laser beam welding have wide advantages over other methods of joining, but they are seen limited to transparent substrates. However, connecting solder bumps with anisotropic conductive adhesives (ACA) produces majority of the joints. A high percentage of them fail in couple of months, particularly when exposed to vibration. In the present work, failure of RFID tags under dynamic loading or vibration was studied; as it was identified as one of the key issue to explore. Earlier investigators focused more on joining chip to the bump, but less on its assembly, i. e., attaching to the substrate. Either of the joints, between chip and bump or between antenna and bump can fail. However, the latter is more vulnerable to failure. Antenna is attached to substrate, relatively fixed when subjected to oscillation. It is the flip chip not the antenna moves during vibration. So, the joint with antenna suffers higher stresses. In addition to this, the strength of the bonding agent i. e., ACA also much smaller compared to the metallic bond {{at the other end of}} the bump. Natural frequency of RFID tags was calculated both analytically and numerically, found to be in kilohertz range, high enough to cause resonance. Experimental investigations were also carried out to determine the same. However, the test results for frequency were seen to be in hundred hertz range, common to some applications. It was recognized that the adhesive material, commonly used for joining chips, was primarily accountable for their failures. Since components to which the RFID tags are attached to experience low frequency vibration, chip joints fail as they face resonance during oscillation. Adhesives having much lower modulus than metals are used for attaching bumps to the substrate antennas, and thus mostly responsible for this reduction in natural frequency. Poor adhesive bonding strength at the interface and possible rise in temperature were attributed to failures under vibration. In order to overcome the early failure of RFID tag joints, Peripheral Soldering, an alternative chip joining method was devised. Peripheral Soldering would replace the traditional adhesive joining by bonding the peripheral surface of the bump to the substrate antenna. Instead of joining solder bump directly to the antenna, holes are to be drilled through antenna and substrate. S-bond material, a less familiar but more compatible with aluminum and copper, would be poured in liquid form through the holes on the chip pad. However, substrates compatible to high temperature are to be used; otherwise temperature control would be necessary to avoid damage to substrate. This S-bond would form metallic joints between chip and antenna. Having higher strength and better adhesion property, S-bond material provides better bonding capability. The strength of a chip joined by Peripheral Soldering was determined by analytical, numerical and experimental studies. Strength results were then compared to those of ACA. For a pad size of 60 micron on a 0. 5 mm <b>square</b> <b>chip,</b> the new chip joints with Sbond provide an average strength of 0. 233 N analytically. Numerical results using finite element analysis in ANSYS 11. 0 were about 1 % less than the closed form solutions. Whereas, ACA connected joints show the maximum strength of 0. 113 N analytically and 0. 1 N numerically. Both the estimates indicate Peripheral Soldering is more than twice stronger than adhesive joints. Experimental investigation was carried out to find the strength attained with S-bond by joining similar surfaces as those of chip pad and antenna, but in larger scale due to limitation in facilities. Results obtained were moderated to incorporate the effect of size. Findings authenticate earlier predictions of superior strengths with S-bond. A comparison with ACA strength, extracted from previous investigations, further indicates that S-bond joints are more than 10 times stronger. Having higher bonding strength than in ACA joints, Peripheral Soldering would provide better reliability of the chip connections, i. e., RFID tags. The benefits attained would pay off complexities involved in tweaking...|$|E
