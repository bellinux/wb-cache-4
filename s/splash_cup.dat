500|$|Cyathus stercoreus, {{commonly}} known as the dung-loving bird's nest, is a species of fungus in the genus Cyathus, family Nidulariaceae. Like other species in the Nidulariaceae, the fruiting bodies of C.stercoreus resemble tiny bird's nests filled with eggs. The fruiting bodies are referred to as <b>splash</b> <b>cups,</b> because they are developed to use the force of falling drops of water to dislodge and disperse their spores.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of impact erosion process constitutes an interesting theme research for its implications in many studies {{such as the}} seal formation, which results in a rapid drop in the infiltration rate, or the analysis of vegetation cover efficiency on rainfall erosivity. To determine impact erosion two different experimental techniques can be used: receiving or ejecting splash cups. Both experimental techniques, as well as theoretical approaches, showed a dependence of impact soil erosion to the <b>splash</b> <b>cup</b> diameter. In this paper, after {{a brief review of}} the main impact soil erosion models, a theoretical model is presented. The model {{is based on the assumption}} that the mass of soil eroded deposits out of the ejecting <b>splash</b> <b>cup</b> along a circumference, which centre is the raindrop impact point and which radius is a predefined equivalent mean jump length. Accounting for main physical parameters influencing impact erosion process, a hyperbolic relationship between sediment yield and <b>splash</b> <b>cup</b> diameter is derived. By using a rainfall simulator, for one clay loam soil, for different ejecting <b>splash</b> <b>cup</b> diameters, experimental runs have been carried out. Experimental results proved the theoretical hyperbolic relationship between the sediment yield and the <b>splash</b> <b>cup</b> diameter. A comparison between measured impact sediment yields and those derived by the theoretical model showed an overestimation of the latter probably due to i) the adopted simplified hypothesis and to ii) to the uneasy evaluation of physical parameters which the model depends on.

40|$|Two {{distinctly}} different mechanisms operate within caves to produce concentrically aminated calcareous oolite, pisolite, and concretion grains.

It is often associated with runoff resulting from sealing and crusting, and soil properties such as soil detachability or soil aggregate stability have been used to express soil resistance to interrill erosion processes, i. e., interrill erodibility. From a literature review including more than fifteen erosion models, we have identified three main methods used to measure these properties: aggregate stability and <b>splash</b> <b>cup</b> detachability, methods performed in the laboratory using only a few grams of soil, and standard plot methods that are based on field plot measurements. This difference makes the parameters involved in assessing interrill erodibility dependent upon the scale and the hydrological processes involved and difficult to compare. According to the literature, the sensitivity of actual erosion models to interrill erodibility is lower than the sensitivity to hydrological properties and rill erodibility parameters.

Two soil materials were tested: a fine sand and a silt loam. The mass of detached sediment was measured with the <b>splash</b> <b>cup</b> technique. The splash cups filled with soil material were exposed to simulated rain intensities ranging between 10 and 140 mm h-l. The detached sediment was collected and weighed, whereas rain intensity, drop diameter, and fall velocity of each raindrop were measured with an optical spectropluviometer. A statistical analysis has been made in order to evaluate which rain parameter best predicts the splash detachment rate. Linear fits between the rate of detached sediment and the product of drop size (D) and drop velocity (V), that is, (DVbeta) -V-alpha with values of a varying between 1 and 6 and values of beta varying between 0 and 2, have been computed. The results indicate that values for a ranging between 3 and 6 and for beta smaller than or equal to 2 best describe the rate of detached sediment. Although all indices containing the mass of water (i. e., D- 3) predicted splash detachment rates relatively well, the product of momentum and drop diameter ((DV) -V- 4) was slightly superior in describing splash detachment.

A wind-tunnel study under wind-driven rains was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} horizontal wind velocity and direction on physical raindrop impact, interrill detachment and transport processes. Windless rains and the rains driven by horizontal wind velocities of 6 ms− 1, 10 ms− 1, and 14 ms − 1 were applied to three agricultural soils packed into a 20 by 55 cm soil pan placed at both windward and leeward slopes of 4. 0, 8. 5, and 11. 3 degrees. Inclined raingauge measurements showed that the impact frequency of wind-driven raindrops on sloping soil surfaces varied extremely depending on wind-velocity and direction. Rain energy was measured by the <b>splash</b> <b>cup</b> method and a kinetic energy sensor. Measurements indicated that an exponential relationship existed between the energy of simulated rainfall and the applied horizontal wind velocity. Soil detachment and rainsplash transport rates were assessed by the amount of splashed particles trapped at set distances on a 7 -m uniform slope segment. Different soil detachment rates occurred depending upon wind velocity and direction under wind-driven rains. Parameters such as fluxes of energy and momentum, which are widely used to predict the soil loss in windless rains, were found to be insensitive to this kind of spatial variability in soil detachment. However, introducing angle of rain incidence as a directionally effective parameter significantly improved the ability of rainfall parameters to account for the variations. Accordingly, the parameters based on the normal impact velocity and impact frequency explained ≥ 82 % of the variation in the detachment rates. Airsplash transport was described by relating transport rate to rainfall parameters and wind shear velocity by a log-linear regression technique, and average airsplash trajectory was predicted by the momentum loss. Sediment transport by rain-impacted shallow overland flow was also adequately described by the selected rainfall and flow parameters. Comparing the contribution of airsplash and thin flow transport as sub-processes of interrill erosion, it is concluded that the airsplash is a significant process that should not be neglected in accurately predicting interrill water erosion. ...|$|E

[...] When the proper conditions and substrate are available, the spores germinate into a filamentous protonema, from which the gametophytes emerge, completing the cycle.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{detachment}} {{process can}} be conceptually divided in two sub-processes included aggregate breakdown (Le Bissonnais, 1996) and movement initiation of breakdown products(Kinnell, 2005). soil detachment depends on raindrop size and mass(Elison, 1944; Bisal, 1960), drop velocity(Elison, 1944; Bisal, 1960), intensity rainfall (Ting et al, 2008), kinetic energy (Kinnell, 2003; Fernandez- Raga et al, 2010), runoff depth(Torri et al, 1987; Kinnell, 1991 and 2005), crop covers(Bancy, 1994; Ghahremani et al, 2011), wind speed(Erpul et al, 2000) and experimental area (cup size) (Leguedois et al, 2005; Luk, 1979; Torri and poesen, 1988). Many of {{studies have been conducted}} to evaluate the relationship between splash and slope (Bryan, 1979; Torri and Poesen, 1992; Wan et al, 1996). Torri and Poesen (1992) expressed that in steep slope the gravity force adds to the drop detaching force and decreases of soil resistance, consequently increases splash erosion rate with increasing slope. Soil splash erosion is also strongly influenced by soil properties including soil particles size distribution (Mazurak and Mosher, 1968; Legout et al, 2005; fan and li, 1993), soil shear strength(Cruse and Larson, 1977; Al-Durrah and Bradford, 1981; Ekwue and ohi; 1990), soil cohesion(Torri et al, 1987), soil organic matter content and aggregate size (Ekwue and Maiduguri, 1991; Qinjuan et al, 2008), soil aggregates stability(Qinjuan et al, 2008), surface crust (Qinjuan et al, 2008). Fire, {{play an important role in}} splash erosion. The absence of vegetation cover in disturbed lands accelerates splash erosion rates by as much as several folds compared to undisturbed sites (Lal, 2001; Thomaz and luiz, 2012). The detachment of soil particles by splash depends on several raindrop characteristics, including raindrop size and mass, drop velocity, kinetic energy, and water drop impact angle (Sharma et al., 1993; Singer and Le Bissonnais, 1998; Cruse et al., 2000, Bhattacharyya et al., 2010). Detachment rate is strongly influenced by soil properties, including soil texture and thickness of the water layer at the soil surface (De Ploey and Savat, 1968; Moss and Green, 1983; Sharma et al., 1991; Kinnell, 1991, Jomaa et al., 2010), soil strength, bulk density, cohesion, soil organic matter content, moisture content, infiltration capacity (Nearing et al., 1988; Owoputi, 1994; Morgan et al., 1998, Planchon et al., 2000, Ghahramani et al., 2011), soil initial water content, surface compaction and roughness (Planchon et al., 2000), the nature of soil aggregates and crust, porosity, capacity of ionic interchange, and clay content (Poesen and Torri, 1988). Several studies have shown that splash detachment rate is mainly related to surface rock fragments in soils with sparse vegetation cover (Jomaa et al., 2012). The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of fire on splash erosion and some erosion depended properties in semi-steppe rangeland of Karsanak region in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province which affected by man-made fire during 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. Materials and Methods: Soil samples were obtained on 2012 from the mentioned regions (8 samplesfrom the burned area and 8 samples as a control (unburned) in the adjacent burned area) from 0 - 7 cm depth.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to explore}} hygrochasy in different genera of various habitats by investigating biomechanics, challenging accepted hypotheses and broadening {{the knowledge of}} the ecology and evolution of this dispersal mechanism. Hygrochasy, the dehiscence of capsules in response to moisture, is a specialized plant movement that facilitates primary dispersal by raindrops. This research enhances the understanding of this intriguing plant behaviour with a multidisciplinary approach outlined in the following paragraphs. Hygrochastic New Zealand Veronica (Plantaginaceae) have been identified and investigated in regards to the anatomy and biomechanics of their opening mechanism and comparisons to related ripening dehiscent species have been drawn. Light microscopy has been used to analyse the capsule anatomy and function, while multivariate methods have been used to explore the data and associations with other characters. A swelling tissue in the septum, which absorbs water quickly and expands and a lignified resistance tissue have been found to cause the opening of hygrochastic capsules. This imbibition mechanism {{can be found in a}} number of hygrochastic genera in different habitats but the position of involved tissues due to capsule anatomy is unique for New Zealand Veronica. Morphological analysis revealed that hygrochasy in Veronica is most likely associated with solitary, erect, narrowly angustiseptate capsules on short peduncles of creeping subshrubs or cushions. The hypothesis that hygrochasy in alpine Veronica is an adaptation to ensure short distance dispersal to safe sites is explored. Dispersal distances were measured in the field and in laboratory experiments and habitat patch size was measured for hygrochastic and related non-hygrochastic species. Habitat patches for alpine hygrochastic Veronica are small and distinctly different from surrounding habitat. They provide safe sites due to their microtopography and the presence of adult cushion plants. Hygrochastic capsules facilitate ombrohydrochory by raindrops, which is an antitelechoric strategy previously reported from desert plant species. For the first time directed short distance dispersal to safe sites could be demonstrated in alpine hygrochastic species. Additionally, environmental attributes for known locations of hygrochastic and related non-hygrochastic Veronica were obtained from LENZ IV in arcGIS. These have been used to identify the environmental amplitude for each species as well as variations in habitat. Non-hygrochastic species show a higher environmental amplitude and grow in a wider range and variety of habitats than hygrochastic species. Hygrochastic Veronica are specialists with a narrow ecological niche and are usually confined to small habitat patches in specific alpine habitats. By combining both approaches I show that hygrochasy in alpine Veronica not only supports safe site strategies in seed dispersal but that hygrochastic Veronica are limited to special habitats requiring specific edaphic conditions. Short-distance dispersal also ensures the persistence of existing populations in these rare habitats. Opening of some sessile New Zealand Colobanthus capsules during rain has been observed in the field and I carried out investigations regarding hygrochastic movements in this genus. Various staining and sectioning techniques for light microscopy have been carried out and scanning electron microscopy has been used to further analyse capsule anatomy. Statistical analysis similar to the investigation of Veronica capsules was employed. In contrast to other species with hygrochastic capsules, Colobanthus capsules are not lignified. Here, opening under wet conditions is a result of a combination of imbibition and cohesion mechanisms. Outer cells of the capsule have a thickened outer cell wall, which absorbs moisture, whereas the inner cells have thin cell walls and the cell lumen swells when water is absorbed. Interestingly, all Colobanthus species have the same capsule anatomy and are therefore capable of hygrochastic opening. Earlier it was assumed that only Colobanthus species with sessile capsules might potentially be hygrochastic. In order to understand the relations between those species and other Colobanthus and to investigate whether this genus is monophyletic, I attempted to solve the phylogeny of this genus. I used the nuclear marker ITS and the chloroplast markers rps 16 and trnT-trnE to investigate the phylogeny with parsimony and Bayesian analyses. A number of outgroups in the family of Caryophyllaceae were used to test for monophyly of Colobanthus. Analyses of combined datasets show that the genus Colobanthus is monophyletic with Sagina as sister clade. Colobanthus forms a crown clade with no distinct differences between species. Results suggest a very recent speciation but further study with different markers or AFLPs is warranted, since the markers used in this study showed very little variation. Hygrochasy has previously been reported and described to some extent in some North American Oenothera (Onagraceae) of subclade B, characterized by winged fruits. Here, I use the same methods employed by Poppendieck to extend the list of known hygrochastic Oenothera and I also describe xerochasy in one additional species. The position of the swelling tissue and resistance tissue is the same in all hygrochastic Oenothera, whereas the positions of these tissues are reversed in the xerochastic species. Hygrochastic movement was also observed in a ripening dehiscent species of subclade B, which is characterized by lanceoloid fruits. Here, hygrochasy occurs when the exocarp disintegrates and the endocarp expands after water absorption, similar to hygrochastic species of subclade B. However, due to the morphology of the capsule, the opening of the fruit does not resolve in a wide <b>splash</b> <b>cup.</b> Hypotheses for hygrochastic capsules have mostly been developed for plants in arid regions. The most prevalent theories are that hygrochasy restricts dispersal in time by limiting dispersal events to rainfall events and therefore favourable germination conditions. Also, hygrochasy restricts seed dispersal to short distances, which increases the survival chance of seeds in the very local parental habitat, rather than surrounding harsh environments. However, hygrochasy occurs in a wide range of unrelated genera in a variety of habitats. Here, I investigate whether the widely accepted hypotheses for arid species also apply to hygrochastic Oenothera in North America. Dispersal experiments, cluster analysis of morphological traits and the analysis of environmental and distribution data were used in this study and compared with similar data for hygrochastic Veronica in New Zealand and hygrochastic Aizoaceae in Southern Africa. Character evolution was also investigated using the latest published phylogenies of Oenothera and Veronica. Results indicate that none of the hypotheses for hygrochasy applies to current day Oenothera. However, it appears that hygrochasy evolved only once in this genus and previous research implies that Oenothera have evolved as part of the Madro-Tertiary flora in the mid- to late Miocene. The Madro-Tertiary flora evolved in a dry, highly seasonal climate. Possessing hygrochastic capsules would be advantageous to restrict dispersal to rare rainfall events in the wet seasons. It therefore appears that at least the temporal restriction hypothesis applies to Oenothera at the time of their evolution. Other, unknown factors might play a role in the persistence of this character...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the influence of plant architectural traits on the erosivity of throughfall we stud- ied throughfall kinetic energy (KE) under tree saplings in a plantation-like experiment in the humid subtropics. Our analyses of rainfall and throughfall KE are based on measurements using calibrated <b>splash</b> <b>cups.</b> Two experiments were carried out, one focusing on density effects and the other testing for species-specific effects and effects of species mixtures. The major architectural traits were measured to characterize sapling morphology. Mixed effects models were used for statistical analysis. In both models, rainfall KE was identified {{as the most important}} effect on throughfall KE. Overall, rainfall KE per area was reduced by 59 % below the canopy of the studied saplings. We found a significant effect of sapling density on throughfall KE. This is primarily due to the relation between free throughfall and released throughfall. As free throughfall possesses a far higher KE than released throughfall originating from saplings, lower sapling density results in higher total throughfall KE. We also showed that the influence of density on throughfall KE decreases with increasing sapling height due to lateral canopy growth of the saplings. Throughfall KE was significantly different among species. We attribute this to species-specific differ- ences in crown architectural traits. These traits have opposite influence on throughfall KE and interact with each other. Depending on its magnitude, one crown trait can possibly superimpose contrary effects of others...|$|R
