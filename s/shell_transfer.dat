30|$|The {{state of}} an as-grown NP surface is {{predetermined}} by {{the conditions of}} solution phase of utilized synthetic methods. The latter should provide the restriction of the NPs final size, stabilization against agglomeration, and abruption of chemical reactions in the ready colloid. All these demands are satisfied by covering the NPs with surfactant molecules, or by using steric stabilization in the case when NPs are grown in polymeric environments, or by combination of both. The state of the NP surface can further be altered by multiple chemical and physical treatments. The post-growth surface modification methods include [11] the replacement of original surface-attached molecules {{by a variety of}} other chemical moieties, functionalization of NPs with various ligand molecules, coverage of a NP core with either inorganic or organic <b>shell,</b> <b>transfer</b> of NPs from aqueous to organic solutions, formation of physical mixtures of as-grown NPs with various polymers, etc. All these strategies involve the changes of the chemical environment of NPs, which leads to the formation of new chemical species on the NPs surface. This makes the analysis of surface-related phenomena rather complicated.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe atomic {{electrostatic}} potentials {{calculated by}} the CHELPG method {{have been shown}} to be sensitive indicators of the gas phase and solution properties of the statins. Solvation free energies in water, n-octanol and n-octane have been determined using the SMD solvent model. The percentage hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity (or lipophilicity) of the statins in solution have been determined using (a) the differences in solvation free energies between n-octanol and n-octane as a measure of hydrophilicity, and the solvation energy in octane as a measure of hydrophobicity (b) the sum of the atomic electrostatic charges on the hydrogen bonding and polar bonding nuclei of the common pharmacophore combined with a solvent measure of hydrophobicity, and (c) using the buried surface areas after statin binding to HMGCR to calculate the hydrophobicity of the bound statins. The data suggests that clinical definitions of statins as either "hydrophilic" or "lipophilic" based on experimental partition coefficients are misleading. An estimate of the binding energy between rosuvastatin and HMGCR has been made using: (a) a coulombic electrostatic interaction model, (b) the calculated desolvation and resolvation of the statin in water, and (c) the first <b>shell</b> <b>transfer</b> solvation energy as a proxy for the restructuring of the water molecules immediately adjacent to the active binding site of HMGCR prior to binding. De-solvation and re-solvation of the statins before and after binding to HMGCR are major determinants of the energetics of the binding process. An analysis of the amphiphilic nature of lovastatin anion, acid and lactone and fluvastatin anion and their abilities to cross the blood brain barrier has indicated that this process may be dominated by desolvation and resolvation effects, rather than the statin molecular size or statin-lipid interactions within the bilayer. The ionization energy and electron affinity of the statins are sensitive physical indicators of the ease that the various statins can undergo endogenous oxidative metabolism. The absolute chemical hardness is also an indicator of the stability of the statins, and may be a useful indicator for drug design...|$|E

The energy-momentum tensor of electrically neutral shell is modelled by the perfect fluid with a polytropic equation of state.

40|$|Non-adiabatic {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{are used to}} analyze the role of different solvent degrees of freedom in the non-radiative relaxation of the first excited state of the hydrated electron. The relaxation occurs through a multi-mode coupling between the adiabatic electronic states. The process cannot be described by a single mode promotion model frequently used in the ``large molecule'' limit of gas phase theories. Solvent librations and vibrations, and the H 2 O asymmetric stretch in particular, are found to be the most effective promotors of the electronic transition. Dissipation of the released energy to the solvent proceeds on two time scales: a fast 10 - 20 fs heating of the first solvation shell, where most of the energy is accepted by the librational degrees of freedom, and a several hundred femtosecond global reconstruction of t he solvent as the first <b>shell</b> <b>transfers</b> its excess energy {{to the rest of the}} molecules. The implications of our use of a semiclassical approximation as the criterion for good promoting and accepting modes are discussed.

40|$|In the {{structural}} design of highways, asphalt concrete layers {{are designed to}} withstand fatigue cracking caused by the repetitive flexing under traffic loading. The current Austroads design guidelines for predicting fatigue cracking in the asphalt concrete layers is the <b>Shell</b> Fatigue <b>Transfer</b> Function.

The research investigates the suitability of the Shell model and examines alternatives {{that would be more}} appropriate for a typical New Zealand dense graded hot mix asphalt. In addition, the research verifies the discrepancies of the Shell fatigue model. Thirteen beam fatigue tests were carried out using a four point flexural test under a constant strain mode. Different constant strain levels were applied until failure. The measured fatigue life was also compared against the <b>Shell</b> Fatigue <b>Transfer</b> Function and alternative prediction models. The results indicate that the Shell model underestimates the fatigue life of this particular asphalt mix by an average factor of 5. 5 (range 3. 1 — 8. 9).
