Stability assessment and predictions of soil slope failures in cold regions {{have always been}} highly multifaceted. The research focused on investigating the key influencing factors of soil slope failures in snowy cold regions for the mitigation of such disasters. As a result, a stability assessment approach based on two-dimensional finite element numerical modelling incorporating non-isothermal seepage flow and pseudo coupled mechanical analyses is recommended which considers the water content changes of the soil induced by the seasonal climatic effects i. e. freeze-thaw action and snowmelt water infiltration explicitly. Case studies of soil slope failures in Hokkaido have been studied using the recommended approach. Site investigations, monitoring of weather and related parameters, geotechnical data assessments, <b>soil</b> <b>characterisations</b> and <b>soil</b> property estimations have been performed as a limited part of this study. It {{has been found that}} the freeze-thaw action and snowmelt water infiltration both influence the soil slope stability significantly. The investigation of the slope failures using the recommended numerical modelling approach revealed the robustness of the approach in analysing soil slope instabilities in seasonal cold regions. The second part of the study focused on soil slope failure predictions. For the prediction of snowmelt induced soil slope failures in seasonal cold regions, an early warning criterion is required. The applicability of existing Japanese early warning criteria i. e. 60 -minute cumulative rainfall and Soil-Water-Index (SWI) relationships, Effective Rainfall (ER) indexes to predict the snowmelt induced soil slope failures are examined using the recommended slope stability assessment approach. An empirical method to quantify the amount of snowmelt water is presented. As a result, a revision for the SWI and ER index incorporating the amount of snowmelt water with rainfall is introduced and the slope failure scenarios are examined. In conclusion, a new criterion Effective Precipitation (EP) index is proposed for the prediction and early warning of snowmelt induced soil slope failures.

Soil water contents (SWC) were found to decrease monotonically with time, with a rapid decrease in the first 50 hrs of free drainage in both soils. Sandy soil was more prone to huge losses of water than loamy soil attributed to numerous large drainable pores in sandy soil.

40|$|Investigations {{have shown}} that visible-near-infrared (VNIR) {{spectroscopy}} can accurately determine soil properties under laboratory conditions. In situ assessment of soil properties is of great benefit for several applications, as spectra can be acquired fast and almost continuously. The present study used partial least squares (PLS) regression to establish a relationship between soil reflectance spectra measured under field conditions and the organic matter and clay content of the soil. Spectra were acquired with a fieldspectrometer in a recently reconstructed floodplain along the river Rhine in The Netherlands. Several spectral pre-processing methods were employed to improve the performance and robustness of the models. Results indicate that, under varying surface conditions, field spectroscopy in combination with multivariate calibration does result in a qualitative relation for organic matter (R 2 = 0. 45) and clay content (R 2 = 0. 43) while under laboratory conditions more accurate results are obtained (R 2 = 0. 69 and 0. 92, respectively).

Proximal gamma-ray spectroscopy has recently emerged as a promising tool to collect fine-scale soil information. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate a proximal gamma-ray spectrometer to predict several soil properties using energy-windows and full-spectrum analysis methods in two differently managed sandy loam fields: conventional and organic. In the conventional field, both methods predicted clay, pH and total nitrogen with a good accuracy (R 2 = 0. 56) in the top 0 – 15 cm soil depth, whereas in the organic field, only clay content was predicted with such accuracy. The highest prediction accuracy was found for total nitrogen (R 2 = 0. 75) in the conventional field in the energy-windows method. Predictions were better in the top 0 – 15 cm soil depths than in the 15 – 30 cm soil depths for individual and combined fields. This implies that gamma-ray spectroscopy can generally benefit <b>soil</b> <b>characterisation</b> for annual crops where the condition of the seedbed is important.

Reduced scale modelling can achieve accurate predictions of in-situ field conditions without intensive field investigations. Geotechnical centrifuge modelling replicates in-situ conditions by accelerating a reduced 1 /n scale model to a multiple n of earth’s gravity, thereby replicating the stress level of a 1 : 1 prototype. In this study bearing capacity testing and penetrometer profiling were carried out on normally and over consolidated kaolin clay models, with various fibre contents. Construction of fibrous models in the drum centrifuge ensured a homogenous soil and a random orientation of fibres during the consolidation process. Bearing capacity testing was carried out in flight with different size and shaped foundations. The undrained shear strength was back calculated from the foundation bearing capacity at two locations; at maximum resistance and at the resistance corresponding to depths of 0. 5 times the width (B) or diameter (D) of the foundation; cone and piezoball penetrometers were also conducted in flight.

In this region, conservation agriculture (CA) {{has been promoted}} as useful set of principles that could improve farmers’ resilience to climate variability and change. However, matching practices to agro-ecological and farmers’ socio-economic conditions remain contentious. Here we combine empirical data and results from a cropping system model to quantify benefits and trade-offs, in terms of sowing opportunity, yield, and yield variability, from adopting CA practices. We hypothesized that CA practices would require less labour, allow farmers to plant earlier, at times closer to optimum planting times and consequently result in higher maize yields. We tested the hypothesis using available household labour and the outputs from a cropping systems model (DSSAT) run for six locations in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Thirty years of climate records and <b>soil</b> <b>characterisations</b> were available for each site. Modelled CA practices included, a basin planting system prepared early during winter (CA-Basins early); a basin planting system prepared late and {{at the onset of}} the rains (CA-basins late); an animal draught direct seeder e. g. using a Fitarelli animal traction planter (CA-Direct seed); an animal traction ripper (CA-Ripper); and a dibble stick manual planting system (CA-Dibble). Check conventional cropping systems included conventional mouldboard ploughing prepared early (CMP-early), and late (CMP-late), which mimicked farmers having early or late access to draft power, respectively. Simulated results showed that CA-Ripper, CA-Direct seeding and CA-Basins improved timeliness of operations and enabled earlier planting across all locations compared to conventional systems. Mechanized CA systems potentially offered farmers flexibility on when to plant. However, timely planting of CA systems did not translate into higher yields when carried out during periods of high rainfall variability. Yield benefits of early plantings in CA were only apparent in Zimbabwe. Rainfall patterns showed a shift of 0. 28 and 0. 39  days yr in planting dates at Chitala and Chitedze, over the simulated 30  years. However, this was not evident at the other four locations. Optimum planting dates established for the six locations were 5 th to 27 th December for Malawi; 26 th December to 7 th January for Mozambique; and 4 th to 7 th December for Zimbabwe.

This area (51. 6 km 2) was affected by over 250 landslides.

In this work, the main results derived by the application of a geotechnical model coupled with a hydrological model for the assessment of debris flows hazard analysis, are reported. This analysis has been developed starting by the following steps: landslide inventory map derived by aerial photo interpretation, direct field survey, generation of a database and digital maps, elaboration of a DTM and derived themes (i. e. slope angle map), definition of a superficial soil thickness map, geotechnical <b>soil</b> <b>characterisation</b> through implementation of a backanalysis on test slopes, laboratory test analysis, inference of the influence of precipitation, for distinct return times, on ponding time and pore pressure generation, implementation of a slope stability model (infinite slope model) and generalisation of the safety factor for estimated rainfall events with different return times. Such an approach has allowed the identification of potential source areas of debris flow triggering. This is used to detected precipitation events with estimated return time of 10, 50, 75 and 100 years. The model shows a dramatic decrease of safety conditions for the simulation when is related to a 75 years return time rainfall event.

In this paper, we examine the use of different soil covers and their influence on seedling recruitment for restoration of a Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) with limited topsoil. The properties of a standard topsoil and topsoil diluted with waste-rock to optimise spread were compared between two topsoil sources with different textures and a fine-textured waste material that is a mining by-product. We studied the physicochemical and hydrological traits of five soil covers (unblended TEC topsoil; TEC topsoil mixed with waste rock; fines; fines mixed with waste rock, and waste rock) with two TEC topsoil sources (plateau and hillslope). <b>Soil</b> <b>characterisation</b> included texture, gravel content, soil surface crust strength, soil moisture and temperature, and surface infiltration.

The standard topsoil cover promoted the greatest seedling emergence showing marked differences between the two topsoil provenances. Importantly, the addition of waste rock to topsoil did not compromise the ability of topsoil to support seedling emergence and is therefore a useful strategy to maximise this resource.

As spatial information on soil quality is required at different scale levels covering the whole area, characterisation exclusively based on soil sampling and analysis is time-consuming and very expensive. A quicker method is developed based on a multivariate calibration procedure using partial least squares (PLS) regression to establish a relationship between reflectance spectra in the visible–near-infrared (VNIR) region and spectrally active soil characteristics (organic matter and clay content) that are inter-correlated with concentration levels of Cd and Zn. Several spectral pre-processing methods (normalisation, multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), derivation, standard normal variate (SNV) transform) were employed to improve the robustness and performance of the calibration models. No pre-processing gave the best results for Cd and Zn with RMSECV equal to 0. 676 and 80. 97 mg kg − 1, respectively.

40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{has three}} major purposes: (1) {{to explore the}} static liquefaction phenomenon in saturated sand as a relevant geotechnical hazard, (2) to show the conventional testing procedures for index characterisation and strength testing of saturated fine sands at low stress levels, and (3) {{to look into the}} fluidization mechanism and the ongoing research into its applications in saturated sand testing, done at Delft University of Technology. The exploring on static liquefaction was performed by a literature study, which allowed to relate the macroscopic scale of this hazard in underwater slopes with the common practices performed in laboratory conditions. The literature found shows that a change in the framework of understanding saturated sand behaviour, accounting for anisotropy, may occur within the next years. In addition, the literature supports that improvements on the liquefaction prediction can only be done via: improvements of: the theoretical framework in which the sand behaviour is studied, the constitutive and numerical models used for prediction of the liquefaction mechanism and the testing and the physical modelling methods allowing for both sand characterisation and the determination of the constitutive model parameters. Some tests performed to characterise a fine sand were selected to see how the method can affect the obtained results and how the conditions of the sample preparation and control can affect the liquefaction potential on a saturated sand sample. The results support that idea that the amount of fines on the sand, indicated generally by a sieving test, can affect the results of the index minimum and maximum void ratio, differentiating the properties of a sand with fines and a sand without fines. In addition, several variables such as the degree of saturation, confining stress levels and membrane penetration can {{contribute to the development of}} pore pressures and the development of liquefaction. The literature study reveals that fluidization has been used on research on granular soils sedimentation, documented in the work by Allen (1984), and is not as new in earth sciences as it was thought to be. Based on the undrained triaxial testing procedure suggested by Jager and Molenkamp (2015 a), where fluidization will be used for sample preparation, some sand batches were prepared, in which layers were removed to characterise the final product. While the results on void ratio distribution along the depth of the column are not sufficient to draw further conclusions, it was found that the discharge rate can affect the porosity distribution during and after fluidization. The study not only showcases two techniques that can allow a quantitative assessment of fluidization mechanism, but also that inclusion of this method in loose sample preparation could bring improvements into granular <b>soils</b> <b>characterisation.</b> Geo-EngineeringGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Detecting and avoiding hazards during navigation is capital {{to preserve the}} mobility of a rover. Low traversal speeds are often enforced to assure that wheeled rovers do not become stuck in challenging terrain, hindering the performance and scientific return of the mission. Even such precautions do not guarantee safe navigation due to non-geometric hazards hidden in the terrain, such as sand traps beneath thin duricrusts. These issues motivate the research of the interaction with rough and sandy planetary terrains of conventional and innovative robot locomotion concepts. Hybrid wheel-legs combine the mechanical and control simplicity of wheeled locomotion with the enhanced mobility of legged locomotion. This concept has been rarely proposed for planetary exploration {{and the study of}} its interaction with granular terrains is at a very early stage. This research focuses on advancing the state-of-the-art of wheel-leg-soil interaction analysis and applying it through in-situ sensing to simultaneously improve the speed and safety of planetary rover missions. The semi-empirical approach used combines both theoretical modelling and experimental analysis of data obtained in laboratory and field analogues. A novel light-weight, low-power sensor system, capable of reliably detecting wheel-leg sinkage and slippage phenomena on-the-fly, is designed, implemented and tested both as part of a simplified single-wheel-leg test bed and integrated in a fully mobile micro-rover. Moreover, existing analytical models for the interaction between deformable terrain and heavily-loaded wheels or lightly-loaded legs are adapted to the generalised medium-loaded multi-legged wheel-leg case and combined into hybrid approaches for better accuracy, as validated against experimental data.

Despite the undoubted importance of root architecture and root/soil interactions to nutrient uptake, {{there is a lack of}} approaches for quantifying plant roots non-invasively at all scales. Mathematical models have allowed our understanding of root and soil interactions to be improved, but are almost invariably reliant on idealised geometries or virtual root growth models.

Microfocus X-ray Computed Tomography (?-CT) is a methodology that has shown promise for noninvasive imaging of roots and soil at various scales. However, this potential has not been extended to consideration of either very small (rhizosphere scale) or large (mature root system scale) samples. This thesis combines discovery experiments and method development in order to achieve two primary objectives: • The development of more robust, well-described approaches to root and soil ?-CT imaging. Chapters 2 and 3 explore the potential of clinical contrasting methods in root investigation, and show how careful consideration of imaging parameters combined with development of user invariant image-processing protocol can improve measurement of macro-porous volume fraction, a key soil parameter. • Chapter 4 develops an assay for first-time 3 D imaging of root hairs in situ within the rhizosphere. The resulting data is used to parameterise an explicit P uptake model at the hair scale, suggesting a different contribution of hairs to uptake than was predicted using idealised geometries. Chapter 5 then extends the paradigm for root hair imaging and model generation, building a robust, modular workflow for investigating P dynamics in the rhizosphere that can accommodate non-optimal soil-water states...|$|E

Under precision irrigation applications, water and associated solute movement will vary spatially within the root zone and excess water application will not necessarily result in deep drainage and leaching of salt below the root zone. This paper estimates that 10 % of the irrigated land area (producing as much as 40 % of the total annual revenue from irrigated land) could be adversely affected by root zone salinity resulting from the adoption of precision irrigation within Australia. The cost of increases in root zone salinisation due to inappropriate irrigation management in the Murray and Murrumbidgee irrigation areas was estimated at AUD 245 million (in 2000 / 01) or 13. 5 % of the revenue from these cropping systems. A review of soil–water and solute movement under precision irrigation systems highlights the gaps in current knowledge including the mismatch between the data required by complex, process-based soil–water or solute simulation models and the data {{that is easily available}} from soil survey and routine soil analyses. Other major knowledge gaps identified include: (a) effect of root distribution, surface evaporation and plant transpiration on soil wetted patterns, (b) accuracy and adequacy of using simple mean values of root zone soil salinity levels to estimate the effect of salt on the plant, (c) fate of solutes during a single irrigation and during multiple irrigation cycles, and (d) effect of soil heterogeneity on the distribution of water and solutes in relation to placement of water. Opportunities for research investment are identified across a broad range of areas including: (a) requirements for <b>soil</b> <b>characterisation,</b> (b) irrigation management effects, (c) agronomic responses to variable water and salt distributions in the root zone, (d) potential to scale or evaluate impacts at various scales, (e) requirements for simplified soil–water and solute modelling tools, and (f) the need to build skills and capacity in soil–water and solute modelling...|$|E
40|$|Performing ponding {{infiltration}} {{runs with}} non-circular sources could represent a good means to sample completely {{an area of}} interest. Regardless of {{the shape of the}} source, predicting the expected reliability of the collected data by infiltrometers should facilitate <b>soil</b> hydraulic <b>characterisation</b> and also allow a more conscious use of the field data. The influence of the shape of the infiltration source (i. e., circular or square) and the analysis procedure of the steady-state infiltration data on the saturated hydraulic conductivity, K s, of a sandy-loam soil was tested in this investigation. Circular and square surfaces sampled with the pressure infiltrometer (PI) yielded similar estimates of K s (i. e., differing by a factor of 1. 05 - 1. 16, depending on the calculation method) when an equivalent radius was considered to geometrically describe the square source. With the simplified falling head (SFH) technique, the shape of the source was irrelevant (i. e., circular and square sources yielding K s values that differed by a factor of 1. 19), as theoretically expected. For the steady-state PI experiment, the twoponding depth approach yielded two times smaller K s values than the one-ponding depth (OPD) approach, probably due to lower steady-state flow rates than those expected for {{the second phase of the}} two-level run. The conclusions were that: i) simple infiltrometer experiments (PI, SFH) can be carried out with square sources; and ii) the simplest PI run (OPD approach) is expected to yield the most reliable predictions of K s. Sampling other soils is advisable in an attempt to make these conclusions of general validity...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} {{attention focused on}} the impacts of fire frequency and season of burn on ecological processes in the Kruger National Park (KNP). Whilst {{there has been some}} examination of these fire effects on soil properties, the explicit linkages of these effects to the hydrology of soils in burnt areas has remained a gap in our understanding. During August 2010, a field scoping campaign was undertaken to assess the impacts, if any, of long-term fire treatments on the hydrology of soils on the experimental burn plots (EBPs) in the KNP. Using various hydrometric and <b>soil</b> physical <b>characterisation</b> instruments <b>soil,</b> hydraulic conductivity and soil strength variations were determined across the extreme fire treatment on the EBPs, the annual August (high fire frequency) plots and the control (no burn) plots, on both the granite and basalt geologies of Pretoriuskop and Satara, respectively. It was found that there were soil hydrological and structural differences to fire treatments on the basalt burn plots, but that these were not as clear on the granite burn plots. In particular, hot, frequent fires appeared to reduce the variation in soil hydraulic conductivity on the annual burn plots on the basalts and led to reduced cohesive soil strength at the surface. Conservation implications: The KNP burn plots are one of the longest running and well studied fire experiments on African savannahs. However, the impacts of fire management on hydrological processes in these water-limited ecosystems remains a gap in our understanding and needs to be considered within the context of climate and land-use changes in the savannah biome. </p...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years or so, the use of {{artificial}} neural networks (ANNs) has increased in many areas of engineering. In particular, ANNs have been applied to many geotechnical engineering problems and have demonstrated some degree of success. A review of the literature reveals that ANNs have been used successfully in pile capacity prediction, modelling <b>soil</b> behaviour, site <b>characterisation,</b> earth retaining structures, settlement of structures, slope stability, design of tunnels and underground openings, liquefaction, soil permeability and hydraulic conductivity, soil compaction, soil swelling and classification of soils. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a general view of some ANN applications for solving some types of geotechnical engineering problems. It is not intended to describe the ANNs modelling issues in geotechnical engineering. The paper also does not intend to cover every single application or scientific paper that found in the literature. For brevity, some works are selected to be described in some detail, while others are acknowledged for reference purposes. The paper then discusses the strengths and limitations of ANNs compared with the other modelling approaches. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} carry out deep {{excavations}} under the water table in urban environments, {{the safety of the}} work site and of the adjacent buildings is a major cause for concern. One of the most common and effective methods of undertaking these excavations involves combining the cut and cover method with a dewatering system. The success of a construction depends on the stability of the excavation bottom, the effects produced outside the excavation by dewatering (soil movements) and/or the state of the enclosure (defects in the diaphragm walls). This study proposes a realistic multidisciplinary procedure to address these issues. The work emphasizes the importance of <b>soil</b> <b>characterisation</b> and underlines the need to perform a Watertightness Assessment Test (WTAT) before the excavation stage. The procedure was applied to the excavation of a deep shaft of the High Speed Train (HST) tunnel in Barcelona. An earlier geological characterisation at large scale ruled out the use of deep pumping wells. However, a subsequent hydrogeological characterisation, which involved borehole logging, grain size analyses, Natural Gamma Ray and pumping tests, revealed the presence of thin transmissive layers inside the low hydraulic conductivity materials. The dewatering system was designed by considering different model scenarios and the safest design was selected for the excavation. Depths of the enclosure and of the pumping wells differed in accordance with the scenarios. The impacts (settlements due to pumping) and the stability in each scenario were computed. The state of the enclosure underwent a WTAT {{before the start of the}} excavation, but after constructing the enclosure, to verify its low permeability. The test consisted in pumping inside the enclosure and monitoring the groundwater behaviour outside the enclosure. Numerical interpretation of this test showed a defect in the diaphragm walls below the excavation bottom. Since this defect was not repaired because of its location (below the bottom of the excavation), the dewatering system had to be redesigned to ensure safety. Surface settlements, which were also a source of concern, were small. They were computed using coupled hydro-mechanical models. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|There are {{significant}} {{worries about the}} impact of heavy metal pollutants in soils during urbanisation and industrialisation in the developing world. Routine chemical analysis of soils is used to characterise the concentration of metals translocated by point source and diffuse actions. This fails to put in context the bioavailability or potency of these analytes. Biosensors offer a novel and direct method for hazard assessment of soils impacted with anthropogenic contamination. However, few significant examples of thorough applications of the biosensor in environment have been confirmed. This thesis makes use of comprehensively characterised biosensors for the applications to different environmental matrices. The objective was to apply and evaluate the performance of biosensors in determining the bioavailable fraction of heavy metals in the environment in conjunction with chemical analysis data. Both constitutively marked and metal induced biosensors were optimised and applied, but only the constitutively marked biosensor was responsive to a range of soils and elements of concern. As the matrix that the biosensors were exposed to became increasingly complex, the biosensors' performance became more difficult to interpret. For the metal induced biosensor, the response to standard aqueous samples was predictable as the relationship between chemical analysis data and biosensor predicted data was strong. By contrast, the performance of the metal induced biosensor was poor in soil samples which were historically contaminated (Chapter 9). This could become impacted by the <b>soil</b> <b>characterisation,</b> such as the presence of eo-contaminants, soil associated carbon or variations in soil pH. The constitutively-marked biosensors offered greater predictability of response and this is the reason why these are widely adopted in soil applications. Bacterial biosensors provide a useful tool for assessing the bioavailable fraction of analytes in soils and for complementing chemical analysis. If matrix matched control samples can be collected, then this technology can be applied {{to a wide range of}} contrasting soils with a suite of contaminants to aid in the development of generic soil hazard evaluation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purposes}} of the multidisciplinary DIGISOIL project are the integration and improvement of in situ and proximal technologies {{for the assessment of}} soil properties and soil degradation indicators. Foreseen developments concern sensor technologies, data processing and their integration to applications of (digital) soil mapping (DSM). Among available techniques, the seismic method is, in this study, particularly tested. The multi-channel analysis of surface wave-data (MASW) method is a relatively new in-situ seismic method for determining shear wave velocity profiles. Testing is performed on the ground surface, allowing for less costly measurements than with traditional borehole methods. The basis of the SASW method is the dispersive characteristic of Rayleigh waves when travelling through a layered medium. Rayleigh wave velocity is determined by the material properties (primarily shear wave velocity, but also compression wave velocity and material density) of the subsurface to a depth of approximately 5 meters. Longer wavelengths penetrate deeper and their velocity is affected by the material properties at greater depth and conversely for shorter wavelengths. MASW testing consists of measuring the surface wave dispersion curve, i. e, the variation of phase velocity with wavelengths, at the site and analysing it through an inversion processing to obtain the corresponding shear wave velocity profile. A dynamic source is used to generate surface waves of different wavelengths (or frequencies) which are monitored by a multi-channel cable at known offsets. A MASW device, adapted to <b>soil</b> <b>characterisation,</b> is proposed in the DIGISOIL project. The system was tested for the digital mapping of soil thickness and soil mechanical parameters for three targeted sites of the DIGISOIL project in Europe having their own pedological contexts (Northern France, Northern Italy and Luxembourg). Penetrometer soundings were also conducted for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of the procedure and evaluating its limitations. The obtained maps should be strong inputs for studies of soil compaction control, carbon stock calculation, pavement evaluation, soil thickness assessment and mapping of subsurface stratigraphy and should help to target conservation measures to the most threatened areas...|$|E
40|$|Guidance is {{provided}} for geotechnical engineers designing {{civil engineering works}} in silty <b>soils.</b> A detailed <b>characterisation</b> of two estuarine silt sites in Ireland is performed and the soil properties are linked to their geological origin. It was found that these soils are susceptible to densification by conventional and high quality fixed piston tube sampling and care {{needs to be taken}} when using laboratory derived design parameters, particularly for consolidation and shear strength properties. One dimensional consolidation and creep of these silts can be modelled successfully by the well known Janbu formulation. Settlement predictions from laboratory derived parameters match reasonably with measured data but tend to underestimate primary consolidation, consistent with a sampling densification effect. Vane data should be used with caution as measured strength values may be high and it seems more reliable parameters can be derived from CPTU tests. Conventional techniques for determining soil strength from triaxial tests in silt are inappropriate due to the dilational nature of the material and more reliable and logical strength estimates can be made from a limiting strain criterion...|$|R

The initial version of SDBm was the SDB database (FAO-ISRIC, World Soil Resources Reports 64, 1989). As its predecessors, SDBm Plus is an ‘open’ system which can be modified in the future. SDBm Plus has been totally re-designed and re-written as a WINDOWS application. It is a user-friendly software designed to harmonise, store and use large amounts of geo-referenced soil profile data, elaborated {{in the field and}} the laboratory, in an efficient and systematic way. The soil profile database can be utilised regardless of scale, at regional, national or local level, in soil monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The main characteristics of this database are the following: i) software development for WINDOWS platforms; ii) multilingual function and automatic translation from English, as source language, to other target languages (so far Spanish, French and German); iii) detailed <b>soil</b> profile <b>characterisation</b> following the conventional procedures of soil survey, making use of ‘assist menus’ in the selected language which greatly facilitates data storage; iv) possibility of monitoring the temporal variability of analytical, physical and hydraulic soil properties; v) metabase facility to describe the methods used in the laboratory analysis; and vi) interface facility to automatize the linkage of soil data to computerised information systems.

40|$|The Serra de Rodes {{catchment}} (NE Spain), {{enclosed in}} the Natural Park of Cap de Creus, represents a typical Mediterranean ecosystem. This semiarid environment, with hot summers and mild winters, has been progressively abandoned by farmers {{during the last}} century. Nowadays, most of hillside soils are abandoned and only small patches of vineyards and olive trees are cultivated with very low management and incomes. In this study, we have assessed the effects of land use and land use change on the main soil quality parameters. Along two altitudinal gradients, we selected 11 random environments representative of the current land uses, in sequence from cultivated to early abandonment. The different vegetation stages were grouped in four main land use types according {{to the age of}} abandonment: cultivated fields (vineyard and olive trees, 0 years), recent abandonment (dense and cleared shrubs, 5 years), mid-abandonment (cleared cork trees and dense olive trees, 25 years) and early abandonment (dense cork trees and pine trees reforestation, 50 years). Erosion plots were installed in the previously selected environments for <b>soil</b> physicochemical <b>characterisation,</b> throughout 1 -year observation, monitoring nutrient losses, runoff volume and sediment yield data. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates significant differences in the main soil quality parameters such as soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (N), water holding capacity (WHC) and pH, among the selected environments under different land use conditions. Factor analysis of the principal components (PCA) enabled the identification of three soil quality indices: index of soil erosion and nutrient losses (SENL), index of soil quality and fertility (SQF) and index of vegetation cover and soil protection (VCP). Soil organic matter, nutrient supply, soil vegetation cover and soil compaction are critical for soil degradation in these environments and they must be managed appropriately in order to ensure continuous soil rehabilitation.
