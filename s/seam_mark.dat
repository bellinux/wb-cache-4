The shell is coiled so whorls barely touch in most, but some have notable overlap. Primary ribs emerge from the umbilical <b>seam,</b> the line <b>marking</b> the inner edge of the particular exposed whorl, and divide on the flanks, usually in two, occasionally in three, forming secondary ribs that cross the outer rim of the shell, known as the venter, uninterrupted.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the computational problems underlying the 3 -D interpretation of surface contours. A surface contour {{is the image of}} a curve across a physical surface, such as the edge of a shadow cast across a surface, a gloss contour, wrinkle, <b>seam,</b> or pigmentation <b>marking.</b> Surface contours by and large are not as restricted as occluding contours and therefore pose a more difficult interpretation problem. Nonetheless, we are adept at perceiving a definite 3 -D surface from even simple line drawings (e. g. graphical depictions of continuous functions of two variables). The solution of a specific surface shape comes by assuming that the physical curves are particularly restricted in their geometric relationship to the underlying surface. These geometric restrictions are examined...|$|R

Sedimentation in the Anambra Basin began in the Campanian with a short marine transgression depositing the units of the Nkporo Group (Owelli Formation, Nkporo Formation, Enugu Formation), which {{consists of}} carbonaceous shales and sandstone members of deltaic origin (Nwajide and Reijers 1996; Odunze and Obi 2013). This unit is overlain by the coal-bearing Mamu Formation deposited in the Late Campanian to Early Maastrichtian, {{at the beginning of}} a regressive phase. It consists of alternating sandstones, sandy shales and mudstones, with interbedded sub-bituminous coal seams (Akande et al. 2007). Overlying the Mamu Formation is the Ajali Formation, which comprises predominantly interbeds of clay laminae and the Nsukka Formation of mid-to-late Maastrichtian age. The Nsukka Formation consists of dark shales and sandstones, with thin coal <b>seams</b> that <b>mark</b> the beginning of the transgression that led into the formation of the Niger Delta Basin in the early Paleogene (Nwajide and Reijers 1996). The sediment packages were deposited during a regressive cycle (relative sea-level fall) within fluvio-tidal, deltaic, shelfal and marine settings (Dim et al. 2017).|$|R

Even in his passion the pirate had avoided {{striking}} him on the head, as a disfiguring mark on the face would diminish his value. Sitting there, he congratulated himself {{that he had been}} beaten with a stick and not with a whip; a stick is a weapon, and he did not feel the same sense of dishonour that he would have experienced had he been beaten with a whip. That such might be his lot in slavery he recognised. The backs of Caretto and his two companions were <b>seamed</b> with the <b>marks</b> inflicted by the gang master's whip, and he could scarce hope to escape the same treatment; but at present he hardly felt a slave. There was another reflection that to some extent mitigated the pain of his bruises; the pirate captain held his treasured gage, and it was his fixed determination to recover it. The man had at first in a rough way treated him fairly, and had allowed him more liberty than the other captives, and he would have felt reluctant to take extreme measure against him to recover the gage. Now he was not only free from any sense of obligation, but had a heavy score to settle with him.|$|R
40|$|Brazing is a {{low-cost}} process used extensively in manufacturing and repair of component assemblies in the aerospace industry. For stainless steel joints requiring an airtight seal, the brazing metal Pd-Ni-Cr-Si-B (PalNiCro) is commonly applied. However {{the underlying mechanisms}} of the brazing process are not well understood, which has precluded optimization of the brazing parameters and reduced the cost-effectiveness of the production process. To address these issues, the role of processing conditions on the wetting characteristics of austenitic AISI 347 and martensitic AISI 410 stainless steel was studied in this work using PalNiCro as the brazing alloy. Sessile drop tests were conducted to assess the effect of time, temperature and surface roughness on the wettability conditions between the stainless steel substrate and brazement. The effect of time and clearance on the microstructure and hardness of the brazement was then examined. A brazing temperature of 980 ºC and a surface roughness from 600 grit SiC grinding paper were determined as the optimal wetting conditions. Under such conditions, {{the value of the}} equilibrium contact angle for the AISI 347 and AISI 410 stainless steels was determined to be approximately 10 º after 100 seconds of melting. Examination of the brazements produced using optimized wetting conditions revealed the formation of borocarbide (Mx(C,B) y) and boride (MxBy) precipitates primarily confined to the grain boundaries and some locations within the interior of the grains, which resulted from the diffusion of boron from the brazing metal. The microstructure of the joint seam consisted of the three distinct regions: (1) a soft ductile nickel solid solution with dissolved palladium and chromium (hardness ~ 220 HV) and (2) palladium silicide (over 600 HV) surrounding (3) very hard Ni-rich islands (over 1000 HV) with the presence of nickel borides. An increase in brazing time showed a slight increase in the maximum brazing clearance (MBC) with also an increase in the diffusion layer for both AISI 347 and AISI 410. The volume fraction of the secondary phases within the joint <b>seam</b> exhibited <b>marked</b> increases up to a clearance of 150 mum with a decrease thereafter and an estimated value of 300 mum as the maximum attainable clearance...|$|R
40|$|All textile {{industries}} aim {{to produce}} competitive textiles. The competition enhancement depends mainly on productivity {{and quality of}} the textiles produced by each industry. Especially in the least developed countries like Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh where textile {{is one of the main}} incomes of economy, still using manual quality control techniques to identify defects in their textile products. Therefore this study carries out to classify defects in textiles with minimum intervention of human being using artificial neural network technology and some principles of image processing techniques. My approach is to identify defects in textile comprises three steps, namely, image processing, image classification and producing the output as a classification chart. I have used the standard techniques of image processing; while the image classification is handled by an ANN trained in the supervised mode with the aid of back propagation training algorithm. I have selected three major defect types of defects from textile quality process. They are cut hole damages, open seam of the garment and pen marks. Input data is a 185220 x 30 matrix and it is representing 30 samples of 185220 elements. The output of the system will be an image file with a defect classification chart. In fact, basically this system is able to classify defects in to three categories. This system mainly is divided in to three sections namely; image processing module, neural network module and output generator module. But the system design is separated in to two parts. The first part of the research processes the images to fit for the input layer of the neural network. The second part uses the input set to classify the defects and adapts the neural net. The prototype develop in this project have been trained to identify cut hole damages, open <b>seam</b> and pen <b>mark</b> of the garments by considering 300 images. A concatenate image, which contained 300 samples of each defect type, was trained and tested. The accuracy rate of recognizing the numbers and symbols were 77 %. However this accuracy rate is very high. Using the neural network technology and back propagation learning algorithm, to classify textile defects were successful even there was a high probability to misclassify different types of defect images with different range of severity rates...|$|R
40|$|The intermontane Soma Basin of West Anatolia holds a key {{position}} as regards palynologic indication of its continental {{sequence of strata}} for the Miocene span of time. In pre-Neogene vales, which were framed by high mountains, a rather extensive sedimentary succession of approx. 500 m was accumulated; the section is composed of fluviatile and lacustrine rocks in both clastic and calcareous facies, including, however, several coal seams (lignites). Two depositional cycles, separated by an erosional phase, are to be distinguished. During the Late Neogene volcanic events caused such drastic changes in the local relief and drainage pattern that in Soma Daglari {{the final stages of}} basin evolution no longer matched adjacent ones. In consequence of the cyclic progress in sedimentation the section was stratigraphically subdivided in Soma and Denis Formations, with subsequently correlated Turgut, Sekkoy and Yatagan Members. Meanwhile, these members have been radiometncally dated at sites near by and in other regions of West Anatolia. Accordingly, the Lower Coal Bed (KM 1, 2) traces back to Late Burdigalian, the Middle Coal Bed (KM 3) most likely to Langhian- Serravallian and the Upper Coal Bed (KP 1, 2) finally to Tortonian. As the section so far includes Early, Middle and Late Miocene units, their characteristics in both facies development and structural evolution seem to correspond quite well modern ideas on the regional geology of Anatolia. A fossil microflora, rich in form species as well as individual specimens, was recognized in those samples taken from the three coal beds. This material occasioned a first comprehensive presentation of Miocene sporomorph assemblages from Soma Basin. Altogether 169 species were noted which refer to 59 form genera. A good few of these palynomorphs, their essential characteristics, stratigraphic ranges, botanical affinities and synonymous taxa being described and listed, show such a long stratigraphical and wide regional distribution that they allow no definite dating. There were, however, certain species noted which not only support a Miocene age of the sedimentary sequence with the coal <b>seams,</b> but also <b>mark</b> out Early Miocene (Burdigarian) for the Lower Coal Bed (KM 1, 2) and Late Miocene (Tortonian) for the Upper Coal Bed (KP 1, 2). The following 18 palynomorphs were recognized to be new species which accordingly had to be described with a diagnosis: Laevigatosporites turcicus n. sp., Cedripites anatolicus n. sp., C. pseudodeodaraeformis n. sp. Piceapollis anatoliensis n. sp., P. minor n. sp., Ephedripites (Ephedripites) anatolicus n. sp., E. (E.) minor n. sp., Cupuliferoidaepollenites longus n. sp., Quercoidites somaensis n. sp., Retitrescolpites globosus n. sp., Striatopollis circularis n. sp., Tricolpites tecturatus n. sp., Tricolpopollenites anatolicus n. sp., Tricolporopollenites turcianus n. sp., Momipites somaensis n. sp., Tricolporopollenites moderates n. sp., Ovoidites lanceolatus n. sp., and Schizosporis ellipsoideus n. sp. In addition to that emendation were considered to suit the following 7 species: Piceapollis neogenicus Nagy n. comb., Pityosporites baileyanus Traverse n. comb., P. miocaenicus Nagy n. comb., Tricolpopollenites robusteus Song, Li & Zhong n. comb., Compositoipollenites denizliensis Nakoman n. comb., Intrabaculitricolporites ellipsoideus Takahashi & Jux n. comb., and Nyssapollenites kruschi (Potonie) Nagy asp. pseudolaesus Potonie n. comb. The coal seams of Soma Daglari, exhibiting Early, Middle and Late Miocene sporomorph associations, serve not only as biostratigraphic markers for regional correlation of Neogene sections but also for the recognition of paleoecologic trends and paleoclimatic events. It turned out, that West Anatolia micro floras of Miocene age do reveal their own characteristics and are not easily compared with those of Central Europe. These lignites were not formed in open low land environments, instead, they arose in insufficiently drained mountain valleys from peats of boggy forests and gyttjas deposited on swampy grounds. Most likely, these marshy places were fringed by some bushwood which connected with extended areas of mixed forests along the hillsides. Proper stands of conifer trees did perhaps only flourish on top of the hills. Sporomorph associations as they were recognized in three successive horizons of the Lower Coal Bed (KM 1, 2) point at a gradual impoverishment of species diversities. This trend seems, however, to be reversed when the microflora of the Upper Coal Bed (KP 1, 2) is considered. To sum up, the mountainous area has highly influenced the composition of the fossil associations as can be concluded again and again from the pollen spectra presented. Nevertheless, disappearances and new occurrence of certain palynomorph groups as well as sporomorph species-in particular among herbs and conifers-may be taken as a prelude of the decisive climatic changes of Late Neogene...|$|R
