50|$|Face cams {{may provide}} {{repetitive}} motion with a groove that forms a closed curve, or may provide function generation with a <b>stopped</b> <b>groove.</b> Cams used for function generation may have grooves that require several revolutions {{to cover the}} complete function, and in this case, the function generally needs to be invertible so that the groove does not self intersect, and the function output value must differ enough at corresponding rotations that there is sufficient material separating the adjacent groove segments. A common form is the constant lead cam, where displacement of the follower is linear with rotation, such as the scroll plate in a scroll chuck. Non-invertible functions, which require the groove to self-intersect, can be implemented using special follower designs.|$|R
50|$|In 1938 stop planks {{and safety}} gates were {{installed}} in the Regent's Canal and in the Grand Union Canal in Greater London area and its Slough branch. <b>Stop</b> plank <b>grooves</b> were cut {{at each end of}} the aqueducts and at all weir sluices, whilst the stop gates were built in such a way that they did not unduly obstruct canal traffic.|$|R
50|$|Kuichigai-hi: Two thin grooves {{that run}} {{the top half}} of the blade; the bottom half is denoted by the outer <b>groove</b> <b>stopping</b> halfway while the inner one expands to fill the width.|$|R
50|$|Bill length shows clinal {{variation}} with {{an increase}} from west to east. The subspecies longipes has distinctly brownish upperparts and the nasal groove extends more than halfway along the bill. In the subspecies ostralegus the nasal <b>groove</b> <b>stops</b> short of the half-way mark. The osculans subspecies lacks white on the shafts of the outer 2-3 primaries and has no white on the outer webs of the outer five primaries.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{establishing}} the Lyman Woodard Organization, he comprised a jazz trio with drummer Melvin Davis and guitarist Dennis Coffey; the ensemble made its reputation playing numerous shows at a nightclub called Cobb's Corner. In 1968, Woodard and Melvin Davis recorded the album Hair And Thangs with Dennis Coffey. Although {{the album was}} released as a solo project by Dennis Coffey in 1969, a single containing [...] "It's Your Thing" [...] ("It's Your Thang" [...] on the LP) and [...] "River Rouge" [...] was released with the artist(s) as [...] "Dennis Coffey and the Lyman Woodard Trio". In 1979, Woodard returned to Cobb's Corner with the Organization to record Don't <b>Stop</b> the <b>Groove,</b> for the Corridor label. The 1987 recording, Dedicacion, featured violinist Regina Carter.|$|R
40|$|Nanocomposites of {{metallic}} {{copper and}} iron oxides films {{have been prepared}} by RF-sputtering of pure CuFeO 2 delafossite target. The films are made of copper and spinel ferrite crystallites of less than 10 nm in diameter. The content of metallic copper and the ferrite composition depend on the sputtering conditions. For the shortest substrate-target distances, films are made of copper and copper substituted magnetite with low copper content. The formation of the metallic and spinel phases {{is due to the}} loss of a small quantity of oxygen during sputtering. When annealed under inert atmosphere, nanometric copper particles located in {{the upper part of the}} film, move on the surface and grow due to coalescence phenomena. The particle motion can be <b>stopped</b> by small <b>grooves</b> allowing the self-assembly of copper particles...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{coatings}} of an Al-Si-SiC composite {{were produced}} on UNS A 03560 cast Al-alloy substrates by laser cladding using {{a mixture of}} powders of Al- 12 wt. % Si alloy and SiC. The microstructure of the coatings depends considerably on the processing parameters. For a specific energy of 26 MJ/m 2 the microstructure consists of SiC particles dispersed in a matrix consisting of primary α-Al dendrites and interdendritic α-Al+Si eutectic. For higher specific energies (58 and 87 MJ/m 2) SiC reacts and dissolves partially in molten aluminum, leading to a microstructure consisting of primary Al 4 SiC 4 and Si and {{a small fraction of}} undissolved SiC particles dispersed in the matrix. Abrasive wear tests were performed on the coatings using a ball cratering device and a suspension of SiC particles (35 wt. % of SiC with an average particle diameter of 4. 25 μm) in water as abrasive. The coatings deposited with a low specific energy (26 MJ/m 2) exhibit an abrasive wear rate of 0. 43 x 10 - 4 mm 3 /m and a hardness of 120 HV, while those prepared with higher specific energy (58 MJ/m 2) present a higher wear rate (1. 7 x 10 - 4 mm 3 /m) despite their higher hardness (250 HV). These results show that Al 4 SiC 4 and Si increase the hardness of the material by dispersion hardening but do not contribute to its abrasive wear resistance, because they are softer than the abrasive particles, and confirm that the parameters used to prepare Al-Si-SiC composite coatings by laser cladding must be selected so that only minimal reactions occur between SiC and molten Al. Microploughing and microcutting are the main material removal mechanisms in all samples. Whenever they exist in sufficient proportion, SiC reinforcement particles <b>stop</b> the <b>grooving</b> action of the abrasive, thus decreasing material loss. There is also some evidence of an increased contribution of microcutting as compared to microploughing in samples prepared with high specific energy, an effect that contributes to decrease their wear resistance...|$|R
5000|$|The concentrating {{machine for}} slimes, which has {{hitherto}} {{been a great}} favourite, is the round buddle, and this was perhaps due to the great simplicity of its construction, which permitted its being made out of the odds and ends of machinery usually to be found on a mine. The fixed and revolving cast-iron heads, shafting, bevel wheels, and driving pulleys, are usually procured from a firm of machinery makers.The buddle itself consists of a shallow circular pit formed in the ground from 14 ft. to 22 ft. diameter, and from 1 ft. to 1½ ft. deep. The poorer the slimes the greater the diameter, and as the product from the buddle always requires re-treatment, it is usual to concentrate first in a machine of small diameter, and then to re-treat the concentrates thus produced in one of a larger diameter. The sides of the buddle pit are formed of stone or brick, set in mortar, and the floor, which has an inclination outwards of 1 in 30, is made either of smooth planed boards or cement run upon a layer of concrete. The centre head is from 6 ft. to 10 ft. in diameter, and may even be less. A revolving head is fixed to the shaft, and this carries four arms. The revolving head receives the slime waters from the trough, and distributes them on an even layer over the fixed head the liquid stream, which {{should be in a}} uniform thin film, falls {{over the edge of the}} fixed head, and distributes itself outwards over the sloping floor of the buddle towards the circumference, depositing in its passage the rich ore it contains, according to its specific gravity, the richest first, close to the fixed head, and the poorest at the circumference. To each of the four arms a board is attached, carrying a cloth or a series of brushes, which sweep round and smooth out each successive layer of mineral as soon as it is formed. In some cases sprays of fresh water are used instead of the cloths or brushes, the number of revolutions in either case being 3 or 4 per minute.The outflow of the waste waters takes place through the small sluice gate shown in the circumference of the huddle. In the door of this sluice is a vertical line of holes, and, as the layer of mineral thickens on the floor, a plug is placed in the lowest hole, and so successively up the series, until the full thickness of the deposit equal to the height of the cone is reached. At this point the machine is <b>stopped,</b> a <b>groove</b> is cut from the cone to the circumference, and samples of the ore are taken and washed on a vanning shovel. By this means an idea is formed as to where the divisions should be made for at the head the concentrates are rich in galena, and then follow the mixed ores, either of galena, blende, and gangue, if blende is present, or of galena and gangue, if it is absent. Two qualities of the mixed ores are formed. Rings are formed around the deposit on the buddle to indicate the division lines. The rich heads are taken out and reworked once in another buddle, when they will be rich enough to be sent to the dolly tub. The middles are likewise re-treated, the ores of approximately the same percentage being treated in the same machine until all the mineral is abstracted, and the waste contains not more than ½ per cent. of lead, and 1 to 1½ per cent. of zinc. By successive re-treatment the minerals may thus be enriched up to 50 to 60 per cent. Pb., and when blende is present, to about 42 per cent. Zn. These concentrates may either be sold as they are, or further enriched in a dolly tub.The great drawbacks to the round buddle are the facts that no clean products can be made straight away. The mineral must be handled several times, always a costly proceeding, and the machine must be stopped when full, and lie idle until emptied. A large number of buddles are always required to cope with the slimes from even a small mill, while in large mills, especially when blende is present, from sixteen to twenty would be needed.|$|R
