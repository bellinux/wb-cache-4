30|$|Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis Carr.) {{wood was}} heated for 0.5 – 16.Oh at {{temperatures}} of 120 °– 200 °C in nitrogen gas or air. The values for Young's modulus, shear modulus, and loss tangent were measured by free-free flexural vibration tests. X-ray diffractometry {{was carried out}} to estimate the crystallinity index and crystallite width. The results obtained are as follows: (1) Density decreased at higher temperatures and longer heating times. The <b>specific</b> Young's <b>modulus,</b> <b>specific</b> shear <b>modulus,</b> crystallinity index, and crystallite width increased during the initial stage and were constant after this stage at 120 °C and 160 °C, whereas they increased during the initial stage and decreased later when the temperature was high. Loss tangent in the longitudinal direction increased under all conditions, whereas that in the radial direction increased at 120 °C and decreased at 160 °C and 200 °C. (2) From the relation between Young's modulus and moisture content, it can be safely said that Young's modulus is increased by the crystallization and the decrement in equilibrium moisture content, and that crystallization (rather than degradation) is predominant at the initial stage of the heat treatment, whereas the latter is predominant as the heating time increases. (3) It is implied that the <b>specific</b> Young's <b>modulus,</b> <b>specific</b> shear <b>modulus,</b> crystallinity index, and crystallite width decreased more in air than in nitrogen gas because of oxidation in air.|$|R

For this purpose, the vibrational properties of wetwood of todomatsu at high temperature were compared with those of normal parts that had lower green moisture content than the wetwood. Specimens were cut respectively from the wetwood and normal parts, and matched in the radial direction. The specimens and the measuring systems were placed in an electric drying oven and free-free vibration tests were conducted in the oven under absolutely dry conditions. The wetwood and the normal parts were tested separately. The temperature was raised from room temperature to 200 °C and then lowered to 50 °C in steps of 25 °C. The <b>specific</b> Young’s <b>modulus</b> decreased with an increase in temperature during the heating process while it increased with the decreasing temperature during the cooling process. There was no significant difference in the <b>specific</b> Young’s <b>modulus</b> between the wetwood and the normal part at all tested temperatures.

Nine trees were examined from three canopy classes: two dominants, five co-dominants and two sub-dominants.
