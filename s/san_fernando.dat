5|$|The Ridge Route was {{official}}ly the Castaic-Tejon Route. The official {{limits of the}} Ridge Route, as built in the 1910s, were SR 126 at Castaic Junction and {{the bottom of the}} grade at Grapevine. Until 1930–31 the road from <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> to Castaic Junction ran through the Newhall Tunnel at <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> Pass and along <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> Road, Magic Mountain Parkway (both part of SR126 until the early 2000s) and Feedmill Road to a former bridge over the Santa Clara River. A 1930 bypass of the tunnel and Newhall through Weldon Canyon is now part of The Old Road.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{government}} of Tamaulipas, most of the damage in the state was in farmland and in residents' dwellings, primarily near Matamoros, Valle Hermoso, Reynosa and <b>San</b> <b>Fernando.</b> In Matamoros, part of the city lost power and running water; in Valle Hermoso, two schools were damaged; in Reynosa, 180people were evacuated from low-lying areas in five districts of the city, while in <b>San</b> <b>Fernando,</b> the main highway through the city was closed, and traffic on the bridge over the Conchos River was restricted to one lane.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being one}} of the most {{significant}} anti-war works of art, The Disasters of War had no impact on the European consciousness for two generations, as it was not seen outside a small circle in Spain until it was published by Madrid's Royal Academy of <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> in 1863.|$|E

5|$|Following the Mexican War of Independence, the {{missions}} were secularized {{and the land}} taken by the Mexican government. In 1834, Lieutenant Antonio del Valle was assigned to inventory the property of Mission <b>San</b> <b>Fernando.</b> The rancho {{was supposed to be}} returned to the Tataviam, but Governor Alvarado deeded it to his friend Del Valle instead on January 22, 1839. The Del Valle family moved into the former estancia buildings (near what is now Castaic).|$|E
5|$|Further {{strengthening}} {{was expected}} by forecasters, {{but did not}} come. The storm's motion slowed, and the center began wobbling erratically toward the coast. The storm made landfall around 11:00UTC on July20 near <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> in Tamaulipas. The storm had sustained winds of 125mph (200km/h), Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. After heading inland over northeast Mexico, it dissipated over the Sierra Madre Oriental on July21.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Rodríguez had {{returned}} to Chile before the crossing, and began a guerrilla war in Santiago de Chile against the royalists, {{in support of the}} upcoming army. He was supported in the south {{of the city and the}} countryside. The strategy was to occupy nearby villages, seize the royalists' weapons and flee. The attacks on Melipilla and <b>San</b> <b>Fernando,</b> and a failed one at Curicó, demoralized the royalists.|$|E
5|$|Many of Goya's preparatory drawings, {{mostly in}} red chalk, have survived and are {{numbered}} {{differently from the}} published prints. He produced two albums of proofs—among many individual proof impressions—of which only one is complete. The full album consists of 85 works, including three small Prisioneros ("Prisoners") made in 1811 which {{are not part of}} the series. Goya gave the copy of the full album, now in the British Museum, to his friend Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez. It contains a title-page inscription in Goya's hand, is signed at the page edges, and has numbers and titles to the prints written by Goya. These were copied on the plates when the published edition was prepared in 1863. By then, 80 had passed from Goya's son, Javier—who had stored them in Madrid after his father left Spain—to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of <b>San</b> <b>Fernando),</b> of which Goya had been director. Numbers 81 and 82 rejoined the others in the Academy in 1870, and were not published until 1957.|$|E
5|$|Nora crossed {{an area of}} {{abnormally}} {{warm water}} near {{the west coast of}} the Baja California Peninsula. It restrengthened slightly before making its first landfall near , Baja California Sur, on September 25.

Hurricane Nora then made a second landfall about 60 miles (95 km) south-southeast of <b>San</b> <b>Fernando,</b> Baja California.|$|E
5|$|Power {{supply in}} Romblon is {{generated}} by the National Power Corporation (NPC) and serviced by two electric cooperatives. Tablas Island Electric Cooperatives (TIELCO) serves the power needs of Tablas Island including San Jose. It operates a 5.070 MW diesel power plant in Odiongan and 1.740 MW power barge in San Agustin. The electric cooperative serves a total of 21,097 house connections. Romblon Electric Cooperative (ROMELCO) supplies the capital town of Romblon through a 1.720 MW diesel power plant and a 1.30 MW power barge.

5|$|A {{production}} called Madman Muntz: American Maverick was screened at film festivals through 2007. Directed by Dan Bunker and Judy ver Mehr, it {{was produced}} by Jim Castoro, an owner of an original Muntz Jet. The film was an official 2005 selection at the <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> Valley International Film Festival and the Ole Muddy Film Festival. The film documents Muntz's life, paying particular attention to his colorful career, and includes interviews with people who knew him and home movie footage contributed by his children.|$|E
5|$|After Mission <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> Rey de España was {{established}} in 1797, the administrators there realized they would need more land for agriculture and livestock, and they looked north to the Santa Clarita Valley to establish their estancia, or mission rancho. Subsequently, the Tataviam who had been living there were relocated to the Mission, where they were baptized and put to work. The Estancia de San Francisco Xavier was built in 1804 at the confluence of Castaic Creek and the Santa Clara River.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its history}} of {{generating}} great earthquakes (1857, 1906) {{the focal point}} of earthquake hazard assessment in California has been the strike-slip San Andreas System of faults. However, a system of faults, including the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System that runs along the border of the San Gabriel and <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> Valleys, has also caused a series of moderate to large events in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The westernmost portion of this fault system ruptured in 1971 and has been identified as one of six major fault systems that pose a threat to the highly populated region.|$|E
5|$|Field {{was raised}} in the <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> Valley. He played guitar in Los Angeles {{for a period of time}} as a young man. He contributed to {{productions}} including electric guitar, jazz, and rock music. He acquired his first computer about 1998, wherein he began to learn musical composition and production. He experimented by taking compositions from Ludwig van Beethoven and Sergei Prokofiev, and inputting them electronically into his computer. He noted in a 2006 interview that his wife Katie O'Brien Field helped with promotion of his music.|$|E
5|$|His older brother, Juan N.

Another brother, José, became a doctor. Yet another brother, Joaquín, fought with Antonio in the Philippine-American War, and later served as governor of La Union from 1904 to 1907. Joaquín would also serve as senator from 1916 to 1919. His three other siblings were Numeriana, Manuel, and Remedios.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} landfall, the NHC issued a {{tropical}} storm warning from Baffin Bay, Texas to Rio <b>San</b> <b>Fernando,</b> Mexico; this was canceled once the storm failed to intensify. The Servicio Meteorológico Nacional warned residents of gusty winds and heavy rainfall in excess of 4–8in (100–200mm) capable of producing localized flooding and mudslides. Upon moving ashore, the depression produced a storm surge of 2–4ft (0.6–1.2m) along the southern coastline of Texas. Rainfall accumulations peaked at 5.16in (131mm) along the Guadalupe River, with lesser amounts elsewhere, including across areas affected by Hurricane Alex a week prior.|$|E

A mass commanded by priest Osvaldo Fernández was held on 14 July 2012 at the Parroquia San Juan de Apóstol, attended by about one thousand people. María José Reyes' body {{was taken to the}} Parque del Recuerdo cemetery, where she was cremated and later buried.|$|E
5|$|Some Hispanics in the {{entertainment}} business served in the United Service Organizations (USO), which provided entertainment to help troop morale. One notable USO entertainer was Desi Arnaz, the Cuban bandleader who starred opposite Lucille Ball in the television show I Love Lucy. When he was drafted into the army in 1943, he was classified for limited service because of a prior knee injury. As a result, he was assigned to direct the U.S.O. programs at a military hospital in the <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> Valley, California, where he served until 1945.|$|E
5|$|The 1979 Imperial Valley {{earthquake}} {{occurred at}} 16:16 Pacific Daylight Time (23:16 UTC) on October 15 {{just south of}} the Mexico–United States border. It affected Imperial Valley in Southern California and Mexicali Valley in northern Baja California. The earthquake had a relatively shallow hypocenter and caused property damage in the United States estimated at $30 million USD. The irrigation systems in the Imperial Valley were badly affected, but no deaths occurred. It was the largest earthquake to occur in the contiguous United States since the 1971 <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> earthquake eight years earlier.|$|E
5|$|A {{relay station}} for GMA Network and Romblon Community TV (affiliate of People's Television Network) in Santa Maria allows the {{province}} to access television shows broadcast by the network from Manila. There are also existing cable providers and local cable stations operating in several municipalities in the province, namely Romblon Cable Corporation (Romblon), Accutronics System Inc. (Odiongan), San Agustin Cable Antenna Corp. (San Agustin), Countryside Satellite Television System Inc. (Looc), Gateway Cable TV Network (Calatrava), San Andres CATV Service Coop. (San Andres), Josefa J. Martinez CATV Services (Alcantara), Magdiwang Cable Television (Magdiwang), and Sibuyan Cable TV (<b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> and Cajidiocan). Aside from these cable stations, {{there are also}} distributors of direct-to-home (DTH) satellite TV such as Cignal Digital TV, Dream Satellite TV, G Sat, and Sky Direct who provide television services for its subscribers.|$|E
5|$|Del Valle {{was born}} in Jalisco, Mexico. His father, Antonio del Valle, was {{a soldier in the}} Spanish army who came to California in 1819 and was mayordomo (administrator and/or foreman) of Mission <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> Rey de España. Ygnacio joined the army as a cadet in 1825 at the Presidio of Santa Barbara. In 1828 he was {{promoted}} to second lieutenant and transferred to the Presidio of San Diego. In 1832, his commander became involved in a power struggle with the commandant of the Presidio of Monterey, where Antonio served. Ygnacio's side won the conflict on the battlefield, causing a rift between father and son, and they never spoke again.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} battle of San Lorenzo is {{acknowledged}} in Argentine historiography as an important battle for Argentine independence, it had little military influence in the conflict. Much of the recognition the battle generated is because San Martín fought in it, as {{the size of the}} forces involved and the length of the clash would normally mean it was considered a military engagement rather than a real battle and it did not influence the development of the Argentine War of Independence. This victory did nothing to prevent further raids from royalist ships as there were new raids at Tigre on August 18, 1813 and yet another one at <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> on August 22. William Brown ended the royalist naval supremacy the following year.|$|E
5|$|Following most {{present day}} {{damaging}} earthquakes, teams of investigators from {{institutions such as}} the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute are sent to the affected region to set up instruments to capture strong motion records, and to study the damage and other effects of the event. This has not always been the case, and the 1954 report from Steinbrugge and Moran that thoroughly detailed the effects (especially to buildings) of the 1952 shocks put in place a model for how modern earthquake reconnaissance reports are written. The strong motion record that was obtained from the 1952 shock, as well as the accelerogram from the 1940 El Centro earthquake, were the most widely used data sets until the 1971 <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's final landfall, Mexico's Secretariat of National Defense {{deployed}} 800 {{troops to}} Nuevo León and Tamaulipas under Plan DN-III-E to help aid operations. The troops enforced mandatory evacuations of 3,337 residents of <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> and Soto la Marina in Tamaulipas. Throughout Nuevo León, 60,000 people were evacuated from their homes. In Tamaulipas, 263,000 people {{were affected by}} Hurricane Alex, and 2,260 homes were flooded. In Coahuila, 80,000 were affected by Alex's remnants, leaving 30% of the municipalities of the state without communication with the outside world. 20,000 were considered total losses, {{most of them in}} Sabinas. Approximately 500,000 people were affected by floods throughout northeastern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center issued {{a tropical storm}} watch from Freeport, Texas to the United States/Mexico border; at the same time, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch southward to Rio <b>San</b> <b>Fernando.</b> Shortly before attaining tropical storm status, the watch in Texas was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. Late on August 15, the warning was extended to San Luis Pass, while the watch in Mexico was discontinued. As Erin made landfall, the warning was canceled, and several flood watches and warnings were issued for counties across southeastern Texas. Upon moving into Oklahoma, flood and flash flood warnings were issued for several counties.|$|E
5|$|In Mier, the {{spillway}} of the Las Blancas Dam was overtopped, {{causing a}} river bridge {{to be destroyed}} and electric power to be lost, as well. In Río Bravo, 50families were evacuated as seven collective farms became hard to reach by road; approximately 90% of the residences in the farms were affected by the storm. In Altamira, 200families were evacuated as well, and relocated to seven shelters. Also, in the municipalities of Burgos, Cruillas, and Méndez there was flooding in collective farms and family dwellings. Overall, the municipalities of Mier, Reynosa, Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, Matamoros, <b>San</b> <b>Fernando,</b> San Carlos, Burgos, Cruillas, Méndez, Soto la Marina, Mante and Altamira were affected in the state, losing potable water and electricity.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{commissioned}} {{near the}} end of the Seven Years' War, Lowestoffe patrolled in British waters until 1773, when it underwent repairs. She was recommissioned in 1777 and served throughout the American War of Independence, including at the Battle of <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> de Omoa. After the bulk of the fighting ended, she returned home to Portsmouth in 1782, and did not see battle for the next decade. She spent most of her later years in British and Mediterranean waters, winning particular glory for her part in an engagement with two French frigates in 1795. Her final duties were back in the familiar waters of the West Indies, where she was wrecked in 1801 while escorting a convoy in the Caicos Islands.|$|E
5|$|Starting at 2100UTC on August9, a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued from Baffin Bay, Texas to La Pesca, Tamaulipas while Gabrielle was still Tropical Depression Eight. By 0900UTC on the following day, the warning was expanded to include areas south to Tampico, Tamaulipas and extended further to Tuxpan, Veracruz twelve hours later. As the latter was occurring, the tropical storm warning was discontinued for Texas. Early on August12, all the warnings in Mexico were discontinued, as the storm had already moved inland. 800people were evacuated in Soto la Marina and <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> in Tamaulipas. People in poor villages in the Rio Grande Valley were given sandbags with Tropical Storm Gabrielle approaching.|$|E
5|$|The six-lane Arroyo Seco Parkway (part of State Route 110) {{begins at}} the Four Level Interchange, a {{symmetrical}} stack interchange {{on the north side}} of downtown Los Angeles that connects the Pasadena (SR 110 north), Harbor (SR 110 south), Hollywood (US 101 north), and Santa Ana (US 101 south) Freeways. The first interchange is with the north end of Figueroa Street at Alpine Street, and the freeway then meets the north end of Hill Street at a complicated junction that provides access to Dodger Stadium. Beyond Hill Street, SR 110 temporarily widens to four northbound and five southbound lanes as it enters the hilly Elysian Park, where the northbound lanes pass through the four Figueroa Street Tunnels and the higher southbound lanes pass through a cut and over low areas on bridges. One interchange, with Solano Avenue and Amador Street, is located between the first and second tunnels. Just beyond the last tunnel is a northbound left exit and corresponding southbound right entrance for Riverside Drive and the northbound Golden State Freeway (I-5). Immediately after those ramps, the Arroyo Seco Parkway crosses a pair of three-lane bridges over the Los Angeles River just northwest of its confluence with the Arroyo Seco, one rail line on each bank, and Avenue 19 and <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> Road on the north bank. A single onramp from <b>San</b> <b>Fernando</b> Road joins SR 110 northbound as it passes under I-5, and a northbound left exit and southbound right entrance connect to the north segment of Figueroa Street. Here the original 1940 freeway, mostly built along the west bank of the Arroyo Seco, begins as the southbound lanes curve from their 1943 alignment over the Los Angeles River into the original alignment next to the northbound lanes.|$|E
