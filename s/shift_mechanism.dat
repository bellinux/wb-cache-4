2500|$|For {{the first}} time since the 2005 Formula One season Williams {{maintained}} continuity with their engine supplier. The FW30 is powered by Toyota's RVX-08 engine, which conforms to FIA [...] V8 regulations. One major change within the engine package is due to the enforcement of a standardised, FIA-approved ECU, manufactured by McLaren Electronic Systems and distributed under the Microsoft brand. This was introduced to eliminate traction control and engine-assisted braking. Drive is via Williams's own seven-speed, semi-automatic transmission, with an electro-hydraulically activated, seamless <b>shift</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1989 Barnard {{pioneered the}} {{electronic}} gear <b>shift</b> <b>mechanism</b> – {{now known as}} a semi-automatic gearbox – which was operated via two paddles on the steering wheel. This revolutionary system had proved fragile in testing since early in 1988 and many in F1 were expecting it to fail. However, new team recruit Nigel Mansell took the new V12 powered Ferrari 640 to victory first time out at the Brazilian Grand Prix in Rio de Janeiro. Barnard had instigated his second technical revolution, and by [...] every team was running {{a copy of the}} Ferrari gearbox. This would unfortunately be the only finish recorded by either Mansell or Berger until Round 7 when Mansell finished second in the French Grand Prix at Paul Ricard. The new gearbox had been the cause of many DNF's for the team but {{by the time they got}} to France the problems had been solved (not enough power from the battery that powered the electronic gearbox) and the semi-automatic gearbox started to show its advantages.|$|E

40|$|Speculative {{execution}} {{has long}} been used as an approach to exploit instruction level parallelism across basic block boundaries. Most existing speculative execution techniques only support speculating along single control path, and heavily rely on branch prediction to choose the right control path. In this paper, we propose an extended predicated execution <b>mechanism,</b> called predicate <b>shifting,</b> to support speculating along multiple control paths. The predicate <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanism</b> maintains a condition/predicate window for each basic block. With the condition/predicate window, instructions can be guarded by predicates related to current or future branch conditions. The predicate <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanism</b> can {{reduce the number of}} required tag bits by shifting conditions/predicates out of the condition/predicate window whenever they are no longer in use.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem {{where a group}} of agents need to choose from a finite set of social outcomes. We assume ev-ery agent’s {{valuation}} for every outcome is bounded and the bounds are public information. For our model, no mecha-nism simultaneously satisfies strategy-proofness, individual rationality, non-deficit, and efficiency. In light of this, we aim to design mechanisms that are strategy-proof, individ-ually rational, non-deficit, and minimize the worst-case effi-ciency loss. We propose a family of <b>mechanisms</b> called the <b>shifted</b> Groves <b>mechanisms,</b> which are generalizations of the Groves mechanisms. We first show that if there exist mechanisms that are strategy-proof, individually rational, and non-deficit, then there exist <b>shifted</b> Groves <b>mechanisms</b> with these prop-erties. Our main result is an Automated Mechanism De-sign (AMD) approach for identifying the (unique) optimal <b>shifted</b> Groves <b>mechanism,</b> which minimizes the worst-case efficiency loss among all <b>shifted</b> Groves <b>mechanisms.</b> Fi-nally, we prove that the optimal <b>shifted</b> Groves <b>mechanism</b> is globally optimal among all deterministic mechanisms that are strategy-proof, individually rational, and non-deficit...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the control {{strategy}} of shifting time involving multigroup clutches for a hydromechanical continuously variable transmission (HMCVT). The dynamic analyses of mathematical models are presented in this paper, and the simulation models are used to study the control strategy of HMCVT. Simulations are performed in Simulation X platform to investigate the shifting time of clutches under different operating conditions. On this basis, simulation analysis and test verification of two typical conditions, which play the decisive roles for the shifting quality, are carried out. The results show that {{there are differences in}} the shifting time of the two typical conditions. In the shifting process from the negative transmission of hydromechanical ranges to the positive transmission of hydromechanical ranges, the control strategy based on the shifting time is switching the clutches of <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanism</b> firstly and then disengaging a group of clutches of planetary gear mechanism and engaging another group of the clutches of planetary gear mechanism lastly. In the shifting process from the hydraulic range to the hydromechanical range, the control strategy based on the shifting time is switching the clutches of hydraulic <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanism</b> and planetary gear mechanism at first and then engaging the clutch of <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|R

50|$|Beyond {{the ease}} of use from a driver's standpoint, an {{additional}} benefit of sequential manual gearboxes is that use of the clutch via foot pedal or hand control can be minimized or completely obviated, with the clutch used only for starting from a complete stop. Formula One cars of the 1990s made the most high-profile debut of this technology in motor sports, and enhanced variations on this theme are still in use in many forms of road racing and drag racing today. The simple push-pull action of the <b>shift</b> <b>mechanism</b> also lends itself to semi-automatic control using either hydraulic or pneumatic actuators—a system {{often referred to as}} paddle-shift. Instead of a manual gear lever, the driver is provided with (usually) a pair of flipper paddles on the steering wheel, rally cars often utilize just a double-acting single paddle. Pulling on the right-hand paddle makes an up-shift and pulling on the left-hand paddle makes a down-shift. The paddle-shift system will use a sophisticated electronic control unit to provide the necessary logic to operate the <b>shift</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This type of paddle-shift system fitted to race and rally cars {{should not be confused with}} most of the current crop of paddle-shift systems fitted to some high-end road cars. These systems often use a dual-clutch transmission or a conventional torque converter automatic transmission which allow driver input to select the gears.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether {{national and international}} tax factors can explain leverage decisions of European multinational corporations. Using the model specification proposed by Møen, Schindler, Schjelderup and Tropina (2011), the study predicts that an affiliate’s leverage depends on host country statutory corporate tax rate and differences between host country tax rate and foreign tax rates. Differences in international tax rates influence international debt shifting whose main idea is claiming interest income in low-tax countries and interest expenses in high-tax countries. Predictions of the model {{form the basis of}} my main research question and sub-questions, which are tested on a data sample of European multinational firms and their majority-owned subsidiaries, obtained from firmlevel Amadeus database. Historical ownership data on majority-owned subsidiaries of European multinational firms is initially obtained from firm-level Orbis database. The obtained results show that an affiliate’s financial structure depends on three tax mechanisms: host country corporate tax rate, external debt <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanism</b> and internal debt <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Due to correlation between the tax mechanisms, omission of any of them from the specification would bias the estimated effect on affiliate’s leverage of the other tax mechanisms that are included in the specification. Assuming a constant historical ownership structure over the sample period would result in misclassified subsidiary-parent relations and a subsequent downward bias in the estimated effect of international debt <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on affiliate’s leverage. Hence, adjustments to historical ownership structure changes are necessary to obtain unbiased estimates of variables that are measured based on data on all affiliates within the multinational group. Finally, European multinational corporations with majority-owned affiliates outside Europe must also be considered carefully. Capital structures of European affiliates which belong to these multinational corporations seem to be less responsive to international tax incentives. This finding can be explained by measurement errors in the international debt <b>shifting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that arise due to disregarding financial and tax data on affiliates outside Europe that belong to the multinational group. nhhma...|$|R
