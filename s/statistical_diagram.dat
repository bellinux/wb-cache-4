40|$|There are {{relatively}} few H 2 CO mappings of large-area giant molecular cloud (GMCs). H 2 CO absorption lines are good tracers for low-temperature molecular clouds towards star formation regions. Thus, {{the aim of}} the study was to identify H 2 CO distributions in ambient molecular clouds. We investigated morphologic relations among 6 -cm continuum brightness temperature (CBT) data and H 2 CO (111 - 110; Nanshan 25 -m radio telescope), 12 CO (1 [...] 0; 1. 2 -m CfA telescope) and midcourse space experiment (MSX) data, and considered the impact of background components on foreground clouds. We report simultaneous 6 -cm H 2 CO absorption lines and H 110 α radio recombination line observations and give several large-area mappings at 4. 8 GHz toward W 49 (50 '× 50 '), W 3 (70 '× 90 '), DR 21 /W 75 (60 '× 90 ') and NGC 2024 /NGC 2023 (50 '× 100 ') GMCs. By superimposing H 2 CO and 12 CO contours onto the MSX color map, we can compare correlations. The resolution for H 2 CO, 12 CO and MSX data was about 10 ', 8 ' and 18. 3 ", respectively. Comparison of H 2 CO and 12 CO contours, 8. 28 -μ m MSX colorscale and CBT data revealed great morphological correlation in the large area, although there are some discrepancies between 12 CO and H 2 CO peaks in small areas.

If you read the Ladybird book “Florence Nightingale” 2 {{you will not}} {{discover}} that she was the first woman to be elected as a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society. In looking around for an area of research I was intrigued to discover that Florence Nightingale, who I always thought of as the “lady with the lamp”, was a competent Mathematician who created her own type of <b>statistical</b> <b>diagram</b> which she used to save thousands of soldiers from needless death. Florence Nightingale headed a group of 38 nurses who went to clean up the hospitals for the British soldiers in the Crimea in 1854. She found that most of the deaths were due to diseases which could be prevented by basic hygiene, such as typhus and cholera. Her improvements were simple but they had an enormous effect: “She and her nurses washed and bathed the soldiers, laundered their linens, gave them clean beds to lie in, and fed them” 3. When she returned to Britain she made a detailed report to the Government setting out what conditions were like and {{what needed to be done}} to reduce deaths in the hospitals. Nothing was done, so she tried again, making another statistical report and included in it three new statistical diagrams to make data collated by William Farr more accessible to people who could not get their minds around tables of figures. These were her polar area diagrams or rose diagrams, sometimes also known as ‘coxcombs’. The first showed how many men had died over the two years 1854 - 5, the second showed what proportions of men had died from wounds in battle, from disease and from other causes, the third showed how the number of deaths had decreased once “sanitary improvements” 4 had been introduced.

This situation forced the Government of Quebec to adopt a public health protection plan against the virus. The plan comprises several fields of intervention including the monitoring of human cases, Corvidae and mosquitoes in order to ensure the early detection of the presence of the virus in a particular area. To help support the monitoring activities, the Integrated System for Public Health Monitoring of West Nile Virus (ISPHM-WNV) has been developed. Results The ISPHM-WNV is a real-time geographic information system for public health surveillance of West Nile virus and includes information on Corvidae, mosquitoes, humans, horses, climate, and preventive larvicide interventions. It has been in operation in the province of Quebec, Canada, since May 2003.

We compared GBM transient 150914 with other SGRBs and found that such an event may be a distinct outlier in some <b>statistical</b> <b>diagrams,</b> possibly due to its specific binary-black-hole merger origin. However, the presence of a "new" group of SGRBs with "unusual" physical parameters is also possible. If the outflow of GBM transient 150914 was launched by the accretion onto the nascent black hole, the magnetic activity rather than the neutrino process is likely responsible for the energy extraction and the accretion disk mass is estimated to be ∼ 10 ^- 5 M_. The GW 150914 /GBM transient 150914 association, if confirmed, would provide the first opportunity to directly measure the GW velocity and its departure from the speed of the light should be within a factor of ∼ 10 ^- 17.
