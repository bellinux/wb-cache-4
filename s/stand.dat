5|$|Despite being a {{continuous}} oval bowl, {{each side of}} the stadium is named {{in the manner of a}} traditional football ground. All sides were initially named by compass direction (North <b>Stand</b> and South <b>Stand</b> for the ends, East <b>Stand</b> and West <b>Stand</b> for the sides). In February 2004, after a vote by fans, the West <b>Stand</b> was renamed the Colin Bell <b>Stand</b> in honour of the former player. The vote was almost cancelled (and the <b>stand</b> instead named after Joe Mercer) due to suspicions it had been hijacked by rival fans who wished to dub the renamed <b>stand</b> The Bell End. However, core supporters of the club made it clear they still wished the <b>stand</b> named after their hero. The East <b>Stand</b> is unofficially known by fans as the Kippax as a tribute to the very vocal east <b>stand</b> at the club's Maine Road ground.|$|E

5|$|On {{the east}} side of the ground, the Bullens Road <b>stand</b> is divided into the Upper Bullens, Lower Bullens and The Paddock. The rear of the south end of the <b>stand</b> houses away supporters. The north corner of the <b>stand</b> is {{connected}} to the Gwladys Street <b>Stand.</b> The current capacity of the <b>stand</b> is 10,546. The <b>stand</b> takes its name from the adjacent Bullens Road. The Upper Bullens is decorated with Archibald Leitch's distinctive truss design.|$|E

In order to ensure the necessary stability for the <b>stands,</b> in different stages of development, it is necessary to set a corresponding thickness of these <b>stands</b> that determines the best spacing. For quantifying the thickness, density, spacing and implicitly the {{stability of}} <b>stands</b> it is necessary to determine some synthetic indicators afferent to the studied <b>stands</b> and respectively to compare them to the reference indicators.

5|$|Opposite the Sir Alex Ferguson <b>Stand</b> is the Sir Bobby Charlton <b>Stand,</b> {{formerly}} Old Trafford's main <b>stand</b> {{and previously}} {{known as the}} South <b>Stand.</b> Although only a single-tiered <b>stand,</b> the Sir Bobby Charlton <b>Stand</b> contains most of the ground's executive suites, and also plays host to any VIPs who may come to watch the match. Members of the media are seated {{in the middle of}} the Upper South <b>Stand</b> to give them the best view of the match. The television gantry is also in the Sir Bobby Charlton <b>Stand,</b> so the Sir Bobby Charlton <b>Stand</b> is the one that gets shown on television least often. Television studios are located at either end of the Sir Bobby Charlton <b>Stand,</b> with the club's in-house television station, MUTV, in the East studio and other television stations, such as the BBC and Sky, in the West studio.|$|E

It is located opposite the Main <b>Stand</b> and houses directors' boxes, which are between the two tiers. The <b>stand</b> also houses the ground's police station. On 3 May 2017, Liverpool announced the Centenary <b>Stand</b> would be renamed the Kenny Dalglish <b>Stand</b> in honour of the club's greatest servant, former player and manager Kenny Dalglish.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Forest <b>stands</b> {{were studied}} to {{determine}} if old-growth forest structure could be mimicked in younger <b>stands</b> via overstory manipulation. Cover and species composition of understory plants were systematically sampled in sixteen thinned second-growth <b>stands</b> and sixteen adjacent unthinned second-growth Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirabel) Franco.) <b>stands.</b> The <b>stands</b> were thinned twenty-four to thirteen years ago. These were compared to seven nearby old-growth <b>stands.</b> Thinned and unthinned <b>stands</b> had matching elevations, aspect, and soils, yet differed primarily in management treatment. Leaf area indices were determined for these <b>stands.</b> Thinned <b>stands</b> differed from the old-growth and unthinned <b>stands</b> in having significantly higher cover values and species numbers, apparently resulting from increased light to the forest floor and {{a greater variety of}} microhabitats created by thinning. Young unthinned and old-growth <b>stands</b> were comparable in terms of cover and richness, but differed in species composition. Diversity indices showed no difference in species diversity between the three types of <b>stands.</b> Ordination of the species/sample data using Detrended Correspondence Analysis showed that understory species composition of the young unthinned and thinned <b>stands</b> was nearly identical. Species composition of old-growth <b>stands</b> differed from thinned and unthinned <b>stands.</b> The ordination indicated that age of the <b>stands,</b> structure of the canopy layers and climate were major determining factors in the species composition of the understory plant communities. Management manipulation of the second growth <b>stands</b> did not yield <b>stands</b> with understory vegetation communities that mimicked those of old-growth <b>stands.</b> The conclusions of this study were: 1) Shrub cover increased with thinning as compared to unthinned and old-growth <b>stands.</b> 2) Thinning increased the species richness of the <b>stands,</b> without increasing the number of exotics. 3) Diversity was not altered by thinning. Old-growth, thinned and unthinned <b>stands</b> did not differ in diversity values. 4) Patterns of community composition in thinned <b>stands</b> were more similar to unthinned equivalent <b>stands</b> than to nearby old-growth...|$|R

As a result, building permanent <b>stands</b> is expected to save money over time. These <b>stands</b> also improved handicapped access. Additionally, Cal Poly renovated the lower portion the older east sideline <b>stands</b> to add handicapped seats and improve accessibility and egress. The new south <b>stands</b> increased capacity by 345 seats, while the renovation of the east <b>stands</b> resulted in a no net increase or decrease in seats.|$|R
