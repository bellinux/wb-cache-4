50|$|A stop order, also {{referred}} to as a stop-loss order, is an order to buy or sell a stock once the price of the stock reaches a specified price, known as the <b>stop</b> <b>price.</b> When the <b>stop</b> <b>price</b> is reached, a stop order becomes a market order. A buy-stop order is entered at a <b>stop</b> <b>price</b> above the current market price. Investors generally use a buy stop order to limit a loss or to protect a profit on a stock that they have sold short. A sell-stop order is entered at a <b>stop</b> <b>price</b> below the current market price. Investors generally use a sell-stop order to limit a loss or to protect a profit on a stock that they own.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of a Sell on Stop order, a market sell order is {{triggered}} when the market price reaches or falls below the <b>stop</b> <b>price.</b> For Buy on Stop orders, a market buy order is triggered when the market price of the stock rises to or above the <b>stop</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E
50|$|The use of stop orders is {{much more}} {{frequent}} for stocks and futures that trade on an exchange than those that trade in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. The exact mechanism of a stop order may vary between brokers and software platforms. For instance, Charles Schwab defines a stop order as follows:Stop orders and stop-limit orders are very similar, the primary difference being what happens once the <b>stop</b> <b>price</b> is triggered. A standard sell-stop order is triggered when the bid price is equal to or less than the <b>stop</b> <b>price</b> specified or when an execution occurs at the <b>stop</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E

50|$|When the <b>stop</b> <b>price</b> is reached, and {{the stop}} order becomes a market order, {{this means the}} trade will {{definitely}} be executed, but not necessarily {{at or near the}} <b>stop</b> <b>price,</b> particularly when the order is placed into a fast-moving market, or if there is insufficient liquidity available relative {{to the size of the}} order.|$|E

50|$|A sell-stop {{order is}} an {{instruction}} {{to sell at}} the best available price after the price goes below the <b>stop</b> <b>price.</b> A sell-stop price is always below the current market price. For example, if an investor holds a stock currently valued at $50 and is worried that the value may drop, he/she can place a sell-stop order at $40. If the share price drops to $40, the broker sells the stock at the next available price. This can limit the investor's losses or lock {{in some of the}} investor's profits (if the <b>stop</b> <b>price</b> is at or above the purchase price).|$|E

50|$|For example, {{a trader}} has bought stock ABC at $10.00 and {{immediately}} places a trailing stop sell {{order to sell}} ABC with a $1.00 trailing stop. This sets the <b>stop</b> <b>price</b> to $9.00. After placing the order, ABC does not exceed $10.00 and falls {{to a low of}} $9.01. The trailing stop order is not executed because ABC has not fallen $1.00 from $10.00. Later, the stock rises to a high of $15.00 which resets the <b>stop</b> <b>price</b> to $13.50. It then falls to $13.50 ($1.50 (10%) from its high of $15.00) and the trailing stop sell order is entered as a market order.|$|E
50|$|Several {{attempts}} were made to stop foreign exploitation of native industries, in particular the fur trade. In 1917, the fur tax was abolished, and efforts were made to <b>stop</b> <b>price</b> exploitation by private fur traders.

50|$|A {{stop-limit order}} {{combines}} {{the features of}} a stop order and a limit order. A stop-limit order is an order {{to buy or sell}} a stock that combines the features of a stop order and a limit order. Once the <b>stop</b> <b>price</b> is reached, a stop-limit order becomes a limit order that will be executed at a specified price (or better). As with all limit orders, a stop-limit order doesn't get filled if the security's price never reaches the specified limit price.|$|E
5000|$|On October 1, 1864, 89th Indiana and the {{detachment}} of the Army of the Tennessee under Andrew J. Smith accompanied Major General Alfred Pleasonton after Major General Sterling <b>Price</b> to <b>stop</b> <b>Price's</b> campaign for Missouri. They fought at the Battle of Westport on October 23, 1864, a battle which {{would later become}} known as [...] "The Gettysburg of the West." [...] The resulting Union victory {{put an end to}} Price's campaign for Missouri. and rendered the Army of Missouri incapable of any future significant operations.|$|R

50|$|On October 19, Price's army {{approached}} Lexington and {{collided with}} Union scouts and pickets about 2:00 p.m., driving {{them back and}} engaging Blunt's main force. The Federals resisted at first, but Price's army eventually pushed them through the town to its western outskirts, then pursued them along the Independence Road until nightfall. Deprived of Curtis's entire force, still encamped in and near Kansas City, the Union army never stood any real chance of <b>stopping</b> <b>Price's</b> force at Lexington. Blunt did, however, further retard the Confederates' dilatory march, and gained valuable information about the size and disposition of Price's command.|$|R
50|$|Under this initiative, {{any health}} {{insurance}} rate change {{will need to}} be approved by the states Insurance Commissioner before it can take effect. Any health insurer requesting such approval will need to provide information to justify their rate changes. The measure also provides procedures for public notice, disclosure, hearing, and subsequent judicial review for this approval process; it was different than similar states in allowing members of the public to sue the commissioner over approved rate hikes. Supporters believed that this will <b>stop</b> <b>price</b> gouging. Opponents were concerned about giving that much power to the Insurance Commissioner, who as an elected politician could be easily influenced be special interest groups.|$|E
50|$|General Curtis {{sent the}} bulk of his 1st Division under Gen. James Blunt to confront the Confederates at Lexington, {{approximately}} forty miles east of Kansas City, on October 19. Blunt was unable to <b>stop</b> <b>Price,</b> but did slow his progress and gathered information on the Confederate forces. Again, at the Little Blue River on October 21, Blunt was forced to retire - but not without slowing Price enough for a pursuing Federal cavalry division under Alfred Pleasonton to close the gap between himself and the Rebels. Additional fighting occurred the next day at Independence, with Price emerging victorious yet again. Curtis was nearly sixty years old, and age had taken a toll on his desire for combat; however, thanks to his aggressive subordinate Gen. Blunt, Curtis decided to make another stand south of Westport. Blunt personally oversaw the construction of a defensive line south of the town along Brush Creek, perpendicular to the Kansas state line.|$|E
40|$|In {{financial}} markets traders often protect their position from a significant decline {{by using a}} trailing stop. Assume the trader is long the market (owns the security). A trailing stop is an order to sell the security at the market, {{if the price of}} the security drops to the <b>stop</b> <b>price.</b> The <b>stop</b> <b>price</b> is always less than the market price when the stop is entered. As the price fluctuates, the stop is raised to remain a fixed distance from the maximum price at which the security trades. In this paper we consider two models for the price process: a discrete time random walk and continuous time Brownian motion, both with positive drift. For these price processes we compute the distribution, mean, and variance of the gain to the trader as well as the duration of the trade when a trailing stop strategy is used. Also discussed is the question of optimizing the distance from the current price to the stop.

40|$|In c. 1540 the {{counsellors}} of the King of Poland {{discovered the}} central tenet of the quantity theory of money.

Their ideas emerged independently and were much more advanced than the views of Copernicus, and they were applied by the Polish government. The article also claims that this policy was, in principle, appropriate to check the rise of prices.

40|$|Risk-neutral traders {{executing}} derivative trades {{on behalf}} of portfolio managers maximize their expected profit compared to trading at pre-determined times by timing trades, using the quickly changing risk exposures of derivative baskets. The optimal order submission strategy is a sequence of stop orders with a time-varying <b>stop</b> <b>price.</b> Timing a straddle trade yields up to 20 bps per day in a frictionless world, and up to 72 bps per day on the S&P 500.

40|$|The trading {{records of}} a {{commodity}} futures trading fund were examined to determine slippage on the fund's futures market transactions. Slippage was about double {{that found in}} previous research that included all traders. Slippage was largest on days with large price movements and for large orders. Funds appear to trade at times when the market is movingquicklyand brokers have trouble filling orders at the target price. Since funds use similar systems, as a group they {{may be responsible for}} increasing intraday price movements because a large number of funds want to trade at the same time. Slippage occurs for stop orders when prices move before the broker is able to fill the order at the <b>stop</b> <b>price.</b> ' Past research such as Glosten and Harris has generally examined execution costs of market orders. Execution costs can arise when market orders arrive but receive execution at a different price from that which prevailed when the order arrived. Despite increased interest in market microstructure, {{little is known about the}} size of slippage with stop orders. Past research on execution costs has used two sources of data: (1) transaction data (actually intraday price changes since each transaction is not recorded); and (2) trading records of floor traders. Neither source of data can provide an estimate of slippage. Transaction data studies (Thompson and Waller; Martell and Helms; Brorsen) estimate liquidity cost...|$|E

40|$|We provide {{analytic}} {{models for}} which the appropriate statistics of the trading the line strategy, Nh, can be derived in closed form. In particular, we provide closed-form expressions concerning the average duration of the open position, E(Nh), the variance of the open duration, Var(Nh), {{the average of the}} <b>stopped</b> log <b>price,</b> E(SNh), the variance of the <b>stopped</b> log <b>price,</b> Var(SNh), the correlation, Corr(Nh, SNh), and the Laplace transform, E(e-sNh). These results are obtained, in discrete time settings, for binomial and other price scenarios. Furthermore, when analytic results are not possible, such as the case of a normal distribution for log returns, we show by simulation that our general conclusions still hold.

5|$|The new {{classical}} school {{culminated in}} real business cycle theory (RBC). Like early classical economic models, RBC models assumed that markets clear and that business cycles {{are driven by}} changes in technology and supply, not demand. New Keynesians tried to address many of the criticisms leveled by Lucas and other new classical economists against Neo-Keynesians. New Keynesians adopted rational expectations and built models with microfoundations of sticky prices that suggested recessions could still be explained by demand factors because rigidities <b>stop</b> <b>prices</b> from falling to a market-clearing level, leaving a surplus of goods and labor. The new neoclassical synthesis combined elements of both new classical and new Keynesian macroeconomics into a consensus. Other economists avoided the new classical and new Keynesian debate on short-term dynamics and developed the new growth theories of long-run economic growth. The Great Recession led to a retrospective {{on the state of}} the field and some popular attention turned toward heterodox economics.|$|R
