They may, indeed, stop short of some hazardous and ambiguous excellence, which they will be taught to postpone to any reasonable degree of good they may actually possess. The opinions maintained in that book never can lead to an extreme, because their foundation is laid in an opposition to extremes. The foundation of government is there laid, not in imaginary rights of men, (which at best is a confusion of judicial with civil principles,) but in political convenience, and in human nature,--either as that nature is universal, or as it is modified by local habits and <b>social</b> <b>aptitudes.</b> The foundation of government (those who have read that book will recollect) is laid in a provision for our wants and in a conformity to our duties: it is to purvey for the one, it is to enforce the other. These doctrines do of themselves gravitate to a middle point, or to some point near a middle. They suppose, indeed, a certain portion of liberty to be essential to all good government; but they infer that this liberty is to be blended into the government, to harmonize with its forms and its rules, and to be made subordinate to its end. Those who are not with that book are with its opposite; for there is no medium besides the medium itself. That medium is not such because it is found there, but it is found there because it is conformable to truth and Nature. In this we do not follow the author, but we and the author travel together upon the same safe and middle path.|$|E

5000|$|In his “Outlines of Sociology,” Emile Waxweiler, {{who is a}} {{professor}} of the University of Brussels, treats, in the first part, of sociology (adaptation to environment, living milieu and social milieu, sociological phenomena in comparative sociology) and, in the second, sociological analysis (sources and method, social formation, <b>social</b> <b>aptitudes,</b> activities and synergies). Professor Waxweiler defines “social ethology,” or “sociology,” since that term already exists, as “the science, or rather, the physiology of the reactional phenomena due to the mutual excitations of individuals of the same species without distinction of sex.” The basis of social affinity is the “impression of organic likeness (similitude),” and the evolution of man’s nervous system has determined characteristic phenomena from the sociological point of view,—”the faculty of perceiving inter-individually specific likeness of organization proceeds on a par with what is called the manifestations of intelligence, i. e., with the complexity of the nervous system” (p. 74). More and more has man become “the animal formed by the other individuals of his species.” ... The only activities of the individual which interest the sociologist are his external activities, and those only in so far as they “produce effectively in another individual of the same species, without distinction of sex, a certain reaction” (p. 169). Activities are distinguished as conjunctive, protective, injurious, competitive, divulgative, gregarious, repetitive, initiative, acquisitive, selective; the social synergies as conformity, interdependence, cephalization, co-ordination, conscience, etc. There is much interesting matter in this volume and the bibliography (pages 297-306, 2 cols. to page) proves the author’s wide reading,—he has made good use of the Pedagogical Seminary and the writings of American devotees of “child study.” But for all this his book is, as he terms it, properly enough, “a sketch.” A useful feature is the “sociological dictionary” (pages 281-295) containing some 2,200 terms without definitions, of more or less sociological import, gleaned from the vocabulary of the French language (Chamberlain 1907: 261-262).|$|E

Using an instrumental variables approach and data from the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, it is documented that the positive link between homeownership and individual social capital investment is largely confined to more built-up neighborhoods (with more inelastic supply of new housing). The empirical findings provide support for the proposition that in these localities house price capitalization provides additional incentives for homeowners to invest in social capital. The findings are also largely consistent with the proposition that built-up neighborhoods provide protection from inflows of newcomers that could upset a mutually beneficial equilibrium involving reciprocal cooperation.

Children with ADHD are often screened for ASD during clinical assessment and when recruited to clinical trials. We predicted that children with ADHD would have more autistic traits than controls and that certain traits would be more prevalent. METHODS: The clinically referred sample consisted of 30 children with ADHD and 30 matched controls aged 9 - 15 years. Children were screened for ASD traits using the <b>Social</b> <b>Aptitudes</b> Scale (SAS) and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). RESULTS: We found that ASD traits were significantly higher in children with ADHD than controls. None of the children received a diagnosis of autism or ASD. However, a large proportion (28 % using the SCQ and 62 % using the SAS) of children with ADHD reached screening thresholds for a predictive diagnosis of ASD. Relative to controls, children with ADHD had significantly higher levels of communication and social deficits, but not repetitive behaviours. CONCLUSION: Further work is needed to establish whether autistic-like communication and social difficulties in children with ADHD are part of the broader ASD phenotype or are specific to ADHD...|$|E

Listening is the capacity to precisely get and decrypt messages in the correspondence procedure. Ontimepaper. Listening is vital to all viable correspondence. Without the capacity to listen viably, messages are effortlessly misconstrued. Therefore, correspondence separates and the sender of the message can undoubtedly end up noticeably disappointed or bothered. For all students listening {{is the most important}} skill. If you are, fail to listen your teachers you are not able to get success. As educators, we perceive the significance of listening both in learning and as a crucial social ability. Our occupation is to tune in to our students and show them how to tune in. Listening is a standout amongst the most vital abilities you can have. How well you listen majorly affects your learning time, and on the nature of your associations with others classmates and teachers. Listening is important: to acquire data, to get it, for delight and to learn. Teachers normally give coordinate guideline and after that give illumination as important. Understudies who listen acutely to headings and addresses - instead of essentially hearing them - have particular preferences. Effective tuning in the classroom spares time and results in enhanced scholastic and <b>social</b> <b>aptitudes.</b> Here, I am going to share some ways by which students can improve their listening skills and get success in their academics. 1. Pay Attention Give the teacher your full focus, and recognize the message. Perceive that non-verbal correspondence likewise "talks" noisily. When listening focus to the words as well as the manner of speaking, outward appearances, and non-verbal communication. This will give you data that will be as essential as the words themselves. 	Look at the teacher straightforwardly. 	Set aside diverting contemplations. 	Do not rationally set up a rejoinder! 	Abstain from being diverted by natural elements. For instance, side discussions. 	"Tune in" to the teacher's non-verbal communication 2. Demonstrate that you are listening Utilize your own particular non-verbal communication and signals to pass on your consideration. 	Gesture at times. 	Smile and utilize other outward appearances. 	Take note of your stance and ensure it is open and welcoming. 	Urge the teacher to proceed with little verbal remarks like yes and uh huh. 3. Give Feedback Our own channels, suppositions, judgments, and convictions can twist what we listen. As an audience, your part is to comprehend what is being said. This may oblige you to reflect what is being said and make inquiries. 	Reflect what has been said by rewording. "What I'm hearing is," and "Seems like you are stating," are extraordinary approaches to reflect back. 	Make inquiries to clear up specific focuses. "What do you mean when you say?" "Is this what you mean?" 	Condense the teacher's remarks intermittently. 4. Concede Judgment Hindering is an exercise in futility. It disappoints the teacher and cutoff points’ full comprehension of the message. 	Enable the teacher to complete each point before making inquiries. 	Try not to hinder with counter contentions. 5. React Appropriately Complete attention is a model for regard and comprehension. You are picking up data and point of view. You do not include anything by assaulting the teacher or generally putting him or her down. 	Be real, open, and legit in your reaction. 	Declare your feelings consciously. 	Treat the other student in a way that you think he or she would need to be dealt with. 6. Placed yourself in their shoes Regardless of whether you concur with the teacher or even have an enthusiasm for what they need to state, what they are stating is vital to them. Envision yourself in their circumstance, needing just to have somebody hear them out. When they are talking, try to consider where they are originating from and why. Envision what their life resembles and what battles they may confront. Students will welcome that you tried to comprehend and truly hear them. 7. Draw what you hear Match students up and request that your couples sit consecutive. One student in each match ought to have a bit of paper and a pen or pencil. Once everybody has settled, give the other student in the combine a conceptual drawing (distinctive shapes possibly signed up together) to depict to the next student in the match. Give them two minutes to depict and draw without asking or noting any inquiries. At that point, you enable one more moment for the drawer to make inquiries. Question: When the time is up, request that they contrast the drawing with the first. Talk about why there were contrasts (there dependably are!). Is it true, that it was the portraying or would it say it was the tuning in? 8. Discussion In sets, one-member talks about a kind of area they would {{get a kick out of}} the chance to visit, giving just inconspicuous indications about the particular place. The audience should get on these nuances and toward the end, prescribe some place reasonable for the teacher in light of their clarification. Coursework. The first teacher will affirm or prevent the helpfulness from securing the proposal, and the two will then examine ways students can remain caution, as an audience, and get on the proper signs to help them assume a key part in talks. 9. Keep eye contact Undivided attention abilities practices do not simply imply that all you need to will be to be a decent audience. It additionally implies that you have to keep your eyes on the individual, which is talking. Keep eye contact at all circumstances. It is essential that you do this since along these lines, the discussions will be more wonderful and you and the teacher will take in a great deal from each other. 10. Demonstrate great listening conduct Too regularly, we begin to plan our next articulation while understudies are talking and do not tune in as eagerly as we ought to. To upgrade your own listening abilities, consider attempting what the directing calling calls "rehashing. " You would summarize your understudies' reactions to pass on that you are really tuning in and to ensure you comprehended them accurately. You could likewise request that they rehash each other's or one of your focuses. “Listening to others viewpoints may reveal the one thing needed to complete your goals. ” D. Ridgle...|$|E

40|$|An {{impressive}} empirical {{literature suggests}} that physical attractiveness is associated with interpersonal attraction and with specific personality traits, {{some of which are}} favorable and many of which are objectively unrelated to attractiveness. Interest-ingly, much of the research investigating the impact of attractiveness on liking and personality inference has not accounted for the role of the self in social perception. In this project I investigated the possibility that perceptual similarity between the self and target contributes to differential judgments of attractive and unattractive indi-viduals. Participants completed self-ratings of physical attractiveness and evaluated a target who was high, medium, or low in physical attractiveness. As expected, participants rated themselves as relatively attractive and as similar on attractiveness to attractive targets. Target evaluations varied as a function of target attractiveness; however, self-ratings on attractiveness moderated the impact of target attractiveness on liking for and personality inferences about the target. Attractiveness similarity also completely mediated the effect of target attractiveness on liking. The findings are discussed with regard to implicit personality theory and implicit egotism. Beautiful people curry favor in extensive ways and in a variety of contexts. They receive lighter prison sentences for the same crime (Kulka & Kessler, 1978; Soloman & Schopler, 1978) and better grades for similar work (Landy & Sigall, 1974), are more persuasive (Parekh & Kanekar, 1994), and elicit more favorable interpersonal behavior (Snyder, Tanke, & Berscheid, 1977) and occupational evaluations (Chaikin, Gillen, Derlega, Heinen, & Wilson, 1978) than their less attractive counterparts. Attractive individuals are also perceived as having better mental health (Cash, Kehr, Polyson, & Freeman, 1977) and <b>social</b> <b>aptitude,</b> as being happier with life and more successful in their occupations (Dion, Berscheid, & Walster, 1972), and as mor...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{few studies}} that have tracked {{children}} with developmental language disorder to adulthood have found that these individuals experience considerable difficulties with psychosocial adjustment (for example, academic, vocational and <b>social</b> <b>aptitude).</b> Evidence that some children also develop autistic symptomatology over time has raised suggestions that developmental language disorder may be a high-functioning form of an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It {{is not yet clear}} whether these outcomes vary between individuals with different subtypes of language impairment. AIMS: To compare the adult psychosocial outcomes of children with specific language impairment (SLI), pragmatic language impairment (PLI) and ASD. METHODS and PROCEDURES: All participants took part in research as children. In total, there were 19 young adults with a childhood history of Specific Language Impairment (M age = 24; 8), seven with PLI (M age = 22; 3), 11 with high functioning ASD (M age = 21; 9) and 12 adults with no history of developmental disorder (Typical; n = 12; M age = 21; 6). At follow-up, participants and their parents were interviewed to elicit information about psychosocial outcomes. OUTCOMES and RESULTS: Participants in the SLI group were most likely to pursue vocational training and work in jobs not requiring a high level of language/literacy ability. The PLI group tended to obtain higher levels of education and work in 'skilled' professions. The ASD participants had lower levels of independence and more difficulty obtaining employment than the PLI and SLI participants. All groups had problems establishing social relationships, but these difficulties were most prominent in the PLI and ASD groups. A small number of participants in each group were found to experience affective disturbances. The PLI and SLI groups showed lower levels of autistic symptomatology than the ASD group. CONCLUSIONS and IMPLICATIONS: The between-group differences in autistic symptomatology provide further evidence that SLI, PLI, and ASD are related disorders that vary along qualitative dimensions of language structure, language use and circumscribed interests. Childhood diagnosis showed some relation to adult psychosocial outcome. However, within-group variation highlights the importance of evaluating children on a case-by-case basis...|$|R
5000|$|Learning disabilities can be {{identified}} by psychiatrists, school psychologists, clinical psychologists, counseling psychologists, neuropsychologists and other learning disability specialists {{through a combination of}} intelligence testing, academic achievement testing, classroom performance, and <b>social</b> interaction and <b>aptitude.</b> Other areas of assessment may include perception, cognition, memory, attention, and language abilities. The resulting information is used to determine whether a child's academic performance is commensurate with his or her cognitive ability. If a child's cognitive ability is much higher than his or her academic performance, the student is often diagnosed with a learning disability. The DSM-IV and many school systems and government programs diagnose learning disabilities in this way (DSM-IV uses the term [...] "disorder" [...] rather than [...] "disability").|$|R
6000|$|I have doubtless said enough, however, in {{illustration}} of the interest attaching to all this service, a service in which {{not one of the}} forces of social energy and devotion, not one of the true social qualities, sympathy, ingenuity, tact, and taste, fail to come into play. Such an exercise of them, as all the incidental possibilities are taken advantage of, represents for us all, who are happily not engaged in the huge destructive work, the play not simply of a reparatory or consolatory, but a positively productive and creative virtue {{in which there is a}} peculiar honour. We Americans are as little neutrals as possible where any aptitude for any action, of whatever kind, that affirms life and freshly and inventively exemplifies it, instead of overwhelming and undermining it, is concerned. Great is the chance, in fact, for exhibiting this as our entirely elastic, our supremely characteristic, <b>social</b> <b>aptitude.</b> We cannot do so cheaply, indeed, any more than the opposite course is found, under whatever fatuity of presumption, inexpensive and ready-made. What I therefore invite all those whom this notice may reach to understand, as for that matter they easily will, is that the expenses of our enlightened enterprise have to be continuously met, and that if it has confidence in such support it may go on in all the alert pride and pity that need be desired. I am assured that the only criticism the members of the Corps make of it is that they wish more of their friends would come and support it either personally or financially--or, best of all, of course, both. At the moment I write I learn this invocation to have been met to the extent of Mr Norton's having within two or three days annexed five fresh cars, with their owners to work them--and all, as I hear it put with elation, 'excellent University men.' As an extremely helpful factor on the part of Volunteers is some facility in French and the goodwill to stay on for whatever reasonable length of time, I assume the excellence of these gentlemen to include those signal merits. Most members of the Staff of thirty-four in all (as the number till lately at least has stood) have been glad to pay their own living expenses; but it is taken for granted that in cases where individuals are unable to meet that outlay indefinitely the subscribers to the Fund will not grudge its undertaking to find any valuable man in food and lodging. Such charges amount at the outside to 1 dollar 75 per day. The expenses of petrol and tyres are paid by the French Government or the British Red Cross, so that the contributor of the car is at costs only for the maintenance of his chauffeur, if he brings one, or for necessary repairs.

40|$|An {{exploratory}} study assessed {{the impact of}} LeMoyne-Owen College (LOC) on students. Eighty randomly selected students (34 freshmen and 46 seniors) partici-pated. They received measures of college adjustment (to the LOC mission), faculty interaction, study habits, personal management, and social adjustment. Results were controlled for <b>social</b> class, <b>aptitude,</b> and variations in age. The results showed that (a) seniors scored higher on all five scales measuring aspects of college adjustment, (b) the strongest effect was {{the impact of the}} LOC mission, (c) males showed more widespread development by a factor of 3 to 1, (d) vocational aspira-tion was the best predictor of grades, and (e) grade point average was the best pre-dictor of the socioeconomic status of vocational aspiration and was positively affected by LOC. The most important implication for institutional action is the power of the mission statement to presage effects on students. Implications for the study of Black student development in college are discussed. There is general evidence that the impact on students of histori-cally Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) is more positive than that of predominantly White colleges, {{which may or may not}} be true in the case of an individual Black institution. For example, Allen (1987) has reported that despite the limited resources on Black campuses, Black students purchase psychological well-being, cultural affinity, nurturing relations, and happiness. Accord-ing to Cheatham, Slaney, and Coleman (1990), students at a Black institution scored higher on the degree to which a student’s lifestyle is consistent with or promotes good health and wellness practices...|$|R
30|$|The model {{we created}} {{to address these}} growing STEM {{challenges}} and calls for action in the improvement of STEM education is called NE STEM 4 U (Cutucache et al. 2016). This program is a student-run, faculty-supervised program that provides inquiry-based after-school STEM activities for socioeconomically disadvantaged youth in grade K- 8 in the Omaha (NE) Public Schools (OPS). Most UG students in the NE STEM 4 U program are volunteers (herein referred to as mentors) from disciplinary STEM or professional education departments at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO). Some mentors in leadership positions, such as student officers, are supported by modest stipends. The program incorporates several key practices and methods that contribute to retention of UG students and preparation of a well-trained STEM workforce mentioned above. For example, we use problem-based learning (PBL) as our model of instruction. For the students who are instructed using PBL, {{it has been shown}} to improve critical thinking and <b>social</b> skills, increases <b>aptitude,</b> enhances mastery of subject matter, and improves retention of information (Chng et al. 2011; Nicholl & Lou 2012; Salinitri et al. 2012; Wiznia et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|Both autism {{spectrum}} conditions (ASCs) and schizophrenia spectrum conditions (SSCs) involve altered or impaired {{social and}} communicative functioning, but whether these shared features indicate overlapping or different etiological factors is unknown. We outline three hypotheses (overlapping, independent, and diametric) for the possible relationship between ASCs and SSCs, and compare their predictions for the expected relationships between autistic and schizotypal phenotypes using the Autism Spectrum Quotient and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief Revised {{from a large}} non-clinical sample of undergraduate students. Consistent with previous research, autistic features were positively associated with several schizotypal features, with the most overlap occurring between interpersonal schizotypy and autistic social and communication phenotypes. The first component of a principal components analysis (PCA) of subscale scores reflected these positive correlations, and suggested {{the presence of an}} axis (PC 1) representing general <b>social</b> interest and <b>aptitude.</b> By contrast, the second principal component (PC 2) exhibited a pattern of positive and negative loadings indicative of an axis from autism to positive schizotypy, such that positive schizotypal features loaded in the opposite direction to core autistic features. These overall PCA patterns were replicated in a second data set from a Japanese population. To evaluate the validity of our interpretation of the PCA results, we measured handedness and mental rotation ability, as these are established correlates of SSCs and ASCs, respectively. PC 2 scores were significantly associated with hand preference, suc...|$|R
40|$|Two {{investigations}} of students entering college (Ns = 84 and 262), {{and one of}} the students completing high school (N = 147) explored the presence of a psychological competence configuration as a com-ponent of personality-functioning. That configuration was hypothe-sized to consist of self-attitudes (Rotter I-E), world attitudes (Rotter Trust), and behavioral attributes (Tyler, Behavioral Attributes of Psychosocial Competence). The configuration held across all 3 sam-ples, with the self-attitudes-behavioral attributes relation strongest. Configural measures were independent of aptitude and grade point measures, but somewhat related to social desirability (Crowne-Mar-lowe). In the high school study, the BAPC significantly differentiated students selected by counselors as exemplary ("getting their lives and school together well ") in contrast to those selected as marginal. The differentiating power of the BAPC proved to be completely inde-pendent of <b>social</b> desirability and <b>aptitude</b> effects and partially inde-pendent of grade point average. Thus these studies establish the presence of a functionally relevant behavioral attributes component of effectiveness. EFFORTS to define patterns of psychosocial effectiveness from a scientific perspective have only recently been undertaken.
