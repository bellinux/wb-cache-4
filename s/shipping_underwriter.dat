The notice, he commanded, was to be posted on the door of Lloyd's of London, the <b>shipping</b> <b>underwriters.</b> In it he declared that the entire British Isles were under naval blockade by Chasseur alone. This affront sent the shipping community into panic and caused the Admiralty to call vessels home from the American war to guard merchant ships which had to sail in convoys. In all, Chasseur captured or sank 17 vessels before returning home.|$|R

50|$|The clipper {{remained}} in passenger service until 1867. In 1867, Marco Polo was converted back to cargo use. During {{her career as}} a cargo ship, the vessel carried guano, coal and timber and visited ports from Aden to Rio de Janeiro and around the Mediterranean Sea. In 1871, James Baines and Co. sold the vessel to Wilson and Blair of South Shields, England and used in the coal and timber trade. The vessel was altered in 1874 to a barque rig and her wooden masts were removed and the clipper was fitted with an iron mast and the yards were shortened by 12 ft. In the 1870s, Marco Polo waited at Callao for over 18 months for a load of guano. This was due to a dispute between the Guano Shipping Association and British <b>shipping</b> <b>underwriters.</b> In the early 1880s, the vessel's hull was deteriorating so to strengthen it, chains were wrapped around it and a windmill-driven pump was installed to counter increasing leakage. In 1881, Marco Polo was purchased by Bell and Lawes of South Shields and in 1882, the ownership was transferred to Captain A. Bull of Christiana. On June 27 a fire broke out while in port at Quebec with little damage. On July 19, 1883 Marco Polo departed Montmorency, Quebec for Europe with a load of timber. On July 22, the clipper encountered a gale and began to take on water. The pumps were unable {{to keep up with the}} leakage and Captain Bull ran the ship aground off Cavendish, Prince Edward Island.|$|R
