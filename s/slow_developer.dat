However, developmental variations that exist within a cohort under any constant rearing condition are not so well investigated. A few such prominent polymorphisms have been studied, but not the subtle ones. The current study investigates the presence of such varying rates of development, slow and fast, in a cohort reared under constant conditions in two ladybirds, Cheilomenes sexmaculata and Propylea dissecta. Our results reveal <b>slow</b> and fast <b>developers</b> in the cohorts of each species and the ratio of <b>slow</b> and fast <b>developers</b> was similar. <b>Slow</b> <b>developers</b> showed a female biased sex ratio. The two developmental variants differed significantly in juvenile duration only in the first instar and the pupal stage, though variations in developmental time were observed in all stages. Fecundity was higher in <b>slow</b> <b>developers,</b> but developmental rates did not affect egg viability. The similar ratio in both ladybirds indicates {{it to be a}} result of either presence of a constant ratio across species or an effect of the similar rearing environment...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Typical {{childhood}} and adolescent development and acquiring self-management skills are crucial for a satisfying adult life and autonomy in social participation. The aims {{of this study}} were to identify patterns of autonomy in social participation and to explore differences between these patterns. Methods: Adolescents with various chronic conditions participating in a survey in 2006 (T 0) were re-invited for a follow-up study (T 1) in 2012. The young adults (18 – 25 years of age) assessed self-management skills, their condition's impact on school or work, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and social participation in various domains. Patterns were identified through cluster analysis. Differences between patterns were analyzed in bivariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Compared with healthy age-mates, our sample (n = 483) generally lagged behind in social participation. Four patterns emerged: typical developers, financially secure laggers, <b>slow</b> <b>developers,</b> and outgoing laggers. The patterns differed regarding gender, educational level, attending special education, having disability benefits, and degree of physical limitations. Groups with a higher level of autonomy in social participation did not necessarily have higher HRQoL but did report higher self-efficacy and independence at both measurements. Conclusions: Autonomy in some participation domains can coincide with a lack of autonomy in others. In addition, better social participation does not necessarily correlate with higher HRQoL, or vice versa. Yet, more social participation was associated with more self-efficacy and independence. Our results emphasize that there is no standardized approach. Clinicians should take care to address all life areas in clinical practice to screen patients' lived experiences and the need for social and self-management support. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|Blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) are carrion feeding {{insects that}} perform a {{critical}} ecological service by recycling nutrients throughout temperate and tropic {{regions of the}} world. Some members of this guild are parasites of vertebrates and important to medical and veterinary research. Given their relatively predictable life cycles and close association with carrion, estimating blow fly age from human and animal remains can also be informative in legal investigations. In the southern United States, the blow fly Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius), known as the secondary screwworm, is a common primary colonizer of carrion, can parasitize mammals, and often is used as evidence in forensic investigations. Accordingly, studies of this organism can contribute to our basic knowledge of decomposition ecology. Life history traits {{are important to the}} evolutionary fitness of any organism and yet, there are very few studies on genetic variation of these phenotypes in blow flies even though knowledge of that variation would aid in medical, agricultural, and forensic endeavors. Natural genetic variation in development time and body size has been observed in C. macellaria. To further evaluate genetic variation in immature development rates of this species, an artificial selection experiment was performed on three Texas populations. After 23 generations of selection at 25 ?C, all experimental populations selected for faster development exhibited approximately a 1. 5 days decrease in mean development times as compared to the founding generation, while those bred for slow development required another 3. 5 days of development. The six selected lines were subsequently reared in different thermal environments (20 ?C, 25 ?C, and 30 ?C), to evaluate their phenotypic plasticity in development time, pupal mass, and immature viability. Under different thermal exposures, C. macellaria developed slower at cooler temperatures and faster at warmer temperatures with a difference between selection groups of approximately 3. 7 days at 30 ?C, 5. 6 days at 25 ?C, and 7. 9 days at 20 ?C. <b>Slow</b> <b>developers</b> reared at 25 ?C and 30 ?C had significantly heavier pupal mass (48. 38 - 51. 85 mg) than the cooler and slower selected lines (38. 00 - 40. 99 mg). Immature viability also differed between selection regimes, with survival to adulthood ranging from 54. 8 - 86. 7 % for all blow flies studied here. Significantly higher lethality was observed in the slow developing blow flies, especially at cooler temperatures. The results of this work suggest that Cochliomyia macellaria harbor considerable genetic variation for development time, {{are more likely to be}} faster developing in the wild, and that alleles that slow development alter correlations among life history traits in a temperature dependent manner. This study of the natural variation in basic blow fly biology provides valuable information regarding the evolutionary biology and ecology of the species. The selected lines provide the basic material to conduct further genetic studies to identify markers associated with variation in development time. These markers could ultimately be used to improve accuracy in estimating the ages of immature secondary screwworms for forensic purposes...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of Google Maps, a <b>slew</b> of <b>developers</b> have built systems which use {{information}} from other sources to produce composite maps showing the locations of various items. These systems are {{commonly referred to as}} “Google Maps Hacks ” {{due to the fact that}} they were originally created before Google published the API for creating these systems. The example system we will be considering throughout this paper is one which shows the locations of movie theaters on a map, given a ZIP code. Since the publication of the Google Maps API, even more applications built around this interesting framework have surfaced on the internet. All of these applications have several properties in common: they fetch their data from somewhere on the internet, they process it in some way (perhaps parsing it out of some human-readable format), they combine it with new formatting, and finally they display it on the map. In addition, since the Google Maps API deals only with raw coordinates, all these systems must perform “geocoding ” to convert the addresses into (latitude, longitude) pairs. All this is a lot of work even for seasoned programmers, and a fair amount of it is nearly identical for each such application. Additionally, any time the Google Maps API changes (which it has on several occasions), all of the existing systems break until they are manually updated. Finally, there is no way that a general internet user can accomplish it without first learning a great deal of programming...|$|R

Sales of units at Leisure World were suspended in September 1967 after a tight mortgage market significantly increased prices and lower than expected interest. Sales resumed on January 1, 1968. Sales were still <b>slow,</b> the <b>developer's</b> carrying costs on the remaining vacant land were large, and the state of Maryland had prohibited further development in the area until a new sewage treatment plant was built, all of which temporarily prevented additional construction. The developer said it would need to develop the remaining vacant land eventually, as the additional residents were needed in order to support the common facilities by way of monthly maintenance fees. In October 1974, Leisure World canceled the sales contracts for 480 semidetached homes and low-rise apartments because inflation had increased construction costs and it was no longer certain when the units would actually be built. Five months later, Leisure World offered the units for sale again at increased prices. In September 1976, the developer agreed to build the 300,000-gallon wastewater treatment plant. Almost one year later, the developer sued the state of Maryland, saying Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission failed to complete a 1965 contract to provide water and sewer connections to the area because the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene had ordered a halt to sewer connections in 1973. The developer also said it was strong-armed into building a sewage treatment facility by the Montgomery County government in order to avoid significant financial losses.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, {{the demand}} for mobile {{application}} devel-opment is high. To be competitive, a mobile application should be cost-effective and should be of good quality. The architecture choice is important {{to ensure the quality}} of the application over time and to reduce development time. Two main leaders are very represented on the mobile market: Apple (iOS) and Google (Android). The iOS development is based on the Model-View-Controller design pattern and is well structured. The Android system does not require any model: the architecture choice and the application quality highly depends on the developer experience. Heterogeneous solutions <b>slow</b> down the <b>developer,</b> while the one known design pattern could not only boost development time, but improve the maintainability, extensibility and performance of the application. In this work, we investigate widely used architectural design patterns and propose a unified architecture model adapted to Android development.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} postlarval {{development}} of Penaeus indicus. Particular emphasis {{is given to}} characterisation of developmental morphology, growth, ontogenetic change in digestive enzymes, and assessment of energy requirements for postlarval substages. The morphology of the Penaeus indicus postlarvae (PL) changes continuously as consecutive substages (PL 1 - 14) were reached by daily moults. After 22 ecdyses (typically 35 days) the PL 22 substage is succeeded by the adult form. Most of the morphological differentiation is observed after 2 weeks at substage PL 14, but the branchiae only reach full development from substage PL 16. The rostrum teeth, telson spines and ratio of body segments are important characters for identification of Penaeus indicus PL stage. Growth of PL 1 postlarvae was significantly slower when fed artificial diets rather than Artemia nauplii. Similarly 14 -day postlarvae which were <b>slow</b> <b>developers</b> (PL 9) also grew slowly on artificial diets whereas postlarvae {{of the same age}} (substage PL 14) did not show this suppression. Trypsin and amylase digestive activities increased with PL development (P 0. 05) with diet fed. Trypsin was low during early PL stages of development and a sharp increase in tryptic activity was only observed at substage PL 20 (24 mm). Amylase increased from PL 1 and exceeded that of trypsin for 2 - 3 weeks after metamorphosis. It appears that during early stages of development postlarvae are unable to efficiently digest artificial diets due to low digestive activity. For smaller 14 -day postlarvae, poor performance is possible related to a genetic regulated constraint and not to digestive capacity since enzyme levels were similar to those in larger PL 14. PL 1 fed for 15 days on commercially dried low-hatch decapsulated Artemia cysts showed comparable growth and survival to that of PLs fed on Artemia nauplii, but significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than that supported by commercial granulated and flake diets and low-hatch decapsulated cysts processed into a granulated diet or dried at 90 °C. Leaching of soluble protein and carbohydrates was high for all artificial diets but low-hatch decapsulated cysts were highly stable in water. Commercially dried low-hatch cysts retain a living membrane capable of osmoregulation and retaining highly digestible nutrients important for fast growth and development of postlarvae. Survival of postlarvae was negatively correlated (P< 0. 05) with leaching of soluble protein, but no correlation was observed for loss of soluble carbohydrates. Daily food ingestion and routine metabolism of postlarvae increased with PL development. Food metabolism (SDA) was low for early PL stages, but increased steadily up to stage PL 16 and remained the same from this substage onwards. Assimilation efficiency decreased for early PL substages and remained low up to PL 13, and then increased steadily. Different energy strategies seem to be adopted during postlarval development to cope with ontogenetic modifications after metamorphosis. During early development little energy is lost in metabolism, and so more energy is converted to growth to support fast development, with increase in predatory behaviour and development of digestive system. Later more energy is lost in metabolism and committed for maintenance. The ontogenetic changes in digestive activity, energy trend and assimilation efficiency latter in PL development seems to reflect the adaptation to benthic carnivorous existence and migration of postlarvae and juveniles form inshore nursery to deeper waters. Stocking density above 20 PLs 1 - reduced growth and survival but increased size variability above the inherent range, for postlarvae PL 1 - 18 days old. However, Penaeus indicus postlarvae showed low agonistic behaviour and tolerated relatively high densities similar to that of other penaeid species, which further enhances the potential and advantages of the white prawn for culture...|$|R

40|$|Since 1961 the City of New York {{has allowed}} {{buildings}} to receive added floor area {{in exchange for}} privately owned public spaces. These spaces, typically {{in the form of}} small outdoor plazas, are spatially clustered in the densest areas of Manhattan and serve as a valuable public amenity for the residents and employees in these areas. Many of the 500 + spaces built before the last major overhaul of the design regulations in 2007 inhibit public use through poor design and management, and new zoning regulations dictate the design and operational standards that make new and redesigned plazas functional and usable. The recent resurgence of the public realm in New York City has brought attention to the quality of public space design and the activities that can take place in the public and private public spaces of the City. As {{the rate at which the}} City constructs new public parks <b>slows</b> and <b>developers</b> continue to provide new and redesigned privately owned public spaces, there exists the potential for new and innovative forms of public space given the variability of the designers. As zoning continues to govern these spaces, the administrative review process is increasingly discretionary and creates many levels of uncertainty for the developer and designer. This thesis examines the regulations and administrative processes for new and redesigned plazas to recommend a level of regulation that is clear, flexible, and sustainable over time. The thesis also examines the elements of the public space projects of the past decade to recommend additional provisions in the zoning regulations to align the design of privately owned public spaces with the emerging ideals of public space design being demonstrated in parks, plazas, and waterfronts around the world. The recommendations presented explore policies for the appropriate level of design review oversight, for including the most appropriate urban elements prevalent in emerging public space trends, and for encouraging higher quality design in plazas. by Richard Anthony Suarez.

40|$|Multithreaded {{programs}} {{are hard to}} get right. A key {{reason is that the}} contract between developers and runtimes grants exponentially many schedules to the runtimes. We present Parrot, a simple, practical runtime with a new contract to developers. By default, it orders thread synchronizations in the well-defined round-robin order, vastly reducing schedules to provide determinism (more precisely, deterministic synchronizations) and stability (i. e., robustness against input or code perturbations, a more useful property than determinism). When default schedules are <b>slow,</b> it allows <b>developers</b> to write intuitive performance hints in their code to switch or add schedules for speed. We believe this "meet in the middle" contract eases writing correct, efficient programs. We further present an ecosystem formed by integrating Parrot with a model checker called dbug. This ecosystem is more effective than either system alone: dbug checks the schedules that matter to Parrot, and Parrot greatly increases the coverage of dbug. Results on a diverse set of 108 programs, roughly 10 x more than any prior evaluation, show that Parrot is easy to use (averaging 1. 2 lines of hints per program); achieves low overhead (6. 9 % for 55 real-world programs and 12. 7 % for all 108 programs), 10 x better than two prior systems; scales well to the maximum allowed cores on a 24 -core server and to different scales/types of workloads; and increases Dbug's coverage by 10 6 - 1019734 for 56 programs.
