5|$|From 1958 to 1960, opinion {{within the}} Australian {{military}} swung between reactivating Sydney as a fast troop transport ship and disposing of her. The Australian Army saw {{the need for}} such a vessel, particularly if war broke out in Southeast Asia: Australian forces would need to be rapidly deployed to the conflict, and sealift {{was the only way to}} effectively move the required number of personnel, equipment, and vehicles. However, the RAN did not want the cost of converting and maintaining Sydney coming from their share of the defence budget, as they felt there was no further use for her. As both <b>strategic</b> <b>airlift</b> and sealift with other naval or civilian vessels were unfeasible, Sydney was reactivated and converted into a fast troop transport ship during 1961 and 1962. All of her aircraft operating equipment was removed, her hangar was converted into accommodation and storage, and her armament was reduced to four single-mounted 40mm Bofors. Sydney was recommissioned as a Fast Troop Transport on 7 March 1962, given the pennant number A214, and assigned back to the training squadron. From April 1962 onwards, Sydney was used to train the ship's company and Army personnel for the troop transport role, while supplementing the RAN's regular training needs. The troopship first saw full use in her new role in August 1963, when she was used to support an amphibious landing at Hervey Bay, Queensland during Exercise Carbine.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF began {{considering}} {{options for}} heavy transport aircraft {{to provide a}} <b>strategic</b> <b>airlift</b> capability during the early 2000s. This investigation was initiated after the ADF deployment to East Timor in 1999 and operations in the Middle East from 2001 revealed shortcomings in the RAAF's ability to transport the increasingly large and heavy vehicles and other items of equipment used by the Australian Army. To support these operations, the ADF found that it needed long-range aircraft capable of carrying larger loads than could be accommodated in the RAAF's force of Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports. As {{a result of this}} capability gap, the ADF needed to use USAF transports and chartered Russian-built commercial heavy lift aircraft to move supplies and equipment from Australia to its forces in Afghanistan and the Middle East. This experience proved frustrating, as both categories of aircraft were often not available and the commercial transports were expensive to lease. The crash of a civil-chartered Ilyushin Il-76 in East Timor in 2003 also raised concerns within the ADF about the safety of the Russian transport aircraft. Following advocacy from the military, the Australian Government announced as part of an update to its national security strategy in December 2005 that it would consider acquiring heavy lift aircraft to supplement the RAAF's Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules transports. This initiative was one of several measures announced in the government's Defence Update 2005 paper, which sought to better prepare the ADF to operate in locations distant from Australia.|$|E

50|$|Military {{transport}} aircraft or military cargo aircraft are typically fixed wing and rotary wing cargo aircraft {{which are used}} to airlift troops, weapons and other military equipment {{by a variety of}} methods to any area of military operations around the surface of the planet, usually outside the commercial flight routes in uncontrolled airspace. Originally derived from bombers, military {{transport aircraft}} were used for delivering airborne forces during the Second World War and towing military gliders. Some military transport aircraft are tasked to perform multi-role duties such as aerial refueling and, rescue missions, tactical, operational and <b>strategic</b> <b>airlifts</b> onto unprepared runways, or those constructed by engineers.|$|R

25|$|In 2006, the {{air force}} signed a letter of intent to {{purchase}} several of the Boeing Integrated Defense C-17 Globemaster III. That order needs to be confirmed, but {{it is to be}} {{made on the basis of}} the formation of a shared NATO C-17 air fleet to support international deployments. Denmark has later withdrawn from this arrangement but it is in existence today. See NATO <b>Strategic</b> <b>Airlift</b> Capability. The United States and the United Kingdom have already bought numerous C-17s, and several other NATO countries are considering doing so, too.|$|E
25|$|The wings on the C-5As were {{replaced}} during the 1980s to restore full design capability. The USAF took {{delivery of the}} first C-5B on 28 December 1985 and the final one in April 1989. The reliability of the C-5 fleet has been a continued issue throughout its lifetime, however the C-5M upgrade program seeks in part to address this issue. Their <b>strategic</b> <b>airlift</b> capacity has been a key logistical component of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Following an incident during Operation Iraqi Freedom where one C-5 was damaged by a projectile, the installation of defensive systems has become a stated priority.|$|E
25|$|The Boeing C-17 Globemaster III {{is a large}} {{military}} transport aircraft. It {{was developed}} for the United States Air Force (USAF) from the 1980s to the early 1990s by McDonnell Douglas. The C-17 carries forward the name of two previous piston-engined military cargo aircraft, the Douglas C-74 Globemaster and the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II. The C-17 commonly performs tactical and <b>strategic</b> <b>airlift</b> missions, transporting troops and cargo throughout the world; additional roles include medical evacuation and airdrop duties. It was designed to replace the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, and also fulfill some of {{the duties of the}} Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, freeing the C-5 fleet for outsize cargo.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} was reactivated in 2005 as the 535th Airlift Squadron at Hickam Air Force Base {{to provide}} <b>strategic</b> and tactical <b>airlift</b> in the Pacific. It {{became the first}} unit located outside the Continental United States to fly the C-17 conducting <b>strategic</b> and tactical <b>airlift.</b> It conducts night vision goggle, low-level, air refueling and austere-airfield operations from within the world's largest area of responsibility. The squadron has provided support for and operated in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn. Additionally, the squadron has provided emergency humanitarian relief to Haiti, Pakistan, Samoa, Kwajalein, Indonesia and Japan.|$|R
50|$|The {{mission of}} the 728th is to provide mission-ready aircrews for {{operational}} support for <b>strategic</b> and tactical <b>airlift,</b> combat airdrop and aeromedical evacuation in support of U.S. Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command and gaining major command objectives.|$|R
50|$|Served as {{the only}} combat-ready C-5 unit capable of airdrop and special {{operations}} procedures in support of tactical forces and national objectives.

This was expertly demonstrated by its support in airlifting troops, equipment and supplies {{in response to the}} 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks.|$|R
25|$|The Canadian Forces has had {{a long-standing}} need for <b>strategic</b> <b>airlift</b> for {{humanitarian}} and military operations around the world. It had followed a pattern similar to the German Air Force in leasing Antonovs and Ilyushins for many of its needs, including deploying the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to tsunami-stricken Sri Lanka in 2005. The Canadian Forces was forced to rely entirely on leased An-124 Ruslan for a Canadian Army deployment to Haiti in 2003. A combination of leased Ruslans, Ilyushins and USAF C-17s was also used to move heavy equipment into Afghanistan. In 2002, the Canadian Forces Future Strategic Airlifter Project began to study alternatives, including long-term leasing arrangements.|$|E
25|$|Kawasaki {{has been}} {{reportedly}} keen to seek {{sales of the}} C-2 to overseas customers {{in addition to the}} domestic market. In the <b>strategic</b> <b>airlift</b> role, the C-2 is one of only a few aircraft in production that can perform its role; others include the Airbus A400M Atlas and the Ilyushin Il-76, and thus has few competitors on the world market. In response to plans by the Japanese government to lower historic defense export restrictions, Kawasaki began actively promoting the C-2 to foreign customers in 2015. New Zealand has expressed interest in the aircraft for the Royal New Zealand Air Force and also in the Kawasaki P-1 maritime patrol aircraft. There have also been discussions regarding exporting the aircraft to the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
25|$|Germany led {{the recent}} effort to lease An-124s for NATO <b>strategic</b> <b>airlift</b> requirements. Two {{aircraft}} are leased from SALIS GmbH as a stopgap until the Airbus A400M is available. Under NATO SALIS programme NAMSA is chartering six An-124-100 transport aircraft. According to the contract An-124-100s of Antonov Airlines and Volga-Dnepr are used {{within the limits}} of NATO SALIS programme to transport cargo by requests of 18 countries: Belgium, Hungary, Greece, Denmark, Canada, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Finland, France, Germany, Czech Republic and Sweden. Two An-124-100s are constantly based on full-time charter in the Leipzig/Halle airport, but the contract specifies that if necessary, two more aircraft will be provided at six days' notice and another two at nine days' notice. The aircraft proved extremely useful for NATO especially with ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.|$|E
50|$|The wing {{has been}} an airlift unit since it was {{established}} as the 164th Air Transport Group in 1961, and has flown a variety of <b>strategic</b> and tactical <b>airlift</b> aircraft. After 34 years as a group, it was expanded to become a wing in 1995.|$|R
