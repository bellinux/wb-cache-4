40|$|Peening {{provides}} {{compression of}} component (6, 46, 56) surfaces {{in order to}} create residual <b>surface</b> <b>compressions</b> to resist crack propagation in components such as aerofoils. Previously peening techniques have had problems with respect to achieving adequate treatment depths, speed of treatment and with respect to effectiveness. By the present method arrangement an electrical conductor (1, 41, 51) {{in the form of a}} wire is subject to electrical pulses to cause evaporation and subsequent breakdown with high power ultrasound (HPU) propagation in a volume of dielectric fluid towards a component and so peening. The electrical conductor (1, 41, 51) ensures that there is limited possibility of electrical discharge to the component (6, 46, 51) surface whilst the positioning of the wire (1, 41, 51) relative to the surface can be adjusted to achieve best effect particularly if reflector (5) devices are utilised to concentrate (HPU) pulse presentation to the component (6, 46, 56). Furthermore, the component (6, 46, 56) can be surface treated in order to provide protection from potentially damaging emissions from evaporation and electrical discharge to the wire (1, 41, 51) ...|$|R

Dimethyloldihydroxyethyleneurea (DMDHEU) is a conventional agent for imparting wrinkle-resistant properties to cotton fabric. DMDHEU-crosslinked fabrics provide excellent wrinkle recovery properties but may affect the fabric hand. In this study, fabrics treated for wrinkle resistance were assessed by the Kawabata Evaluation System for Fabric (KES-F), which objectively evaluates low-stress mechanical properties of textiles. Four curing temperatures, 110, 130, 150, and 170 ºC, {{were used in the}} wrinkle resistant finishing and effects of different concentrations of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) used as co-catalyst were also studied. It was found that changes in curing temperature (from 110 to 170 ºC) have an obvious effect on tensile, shearing and bending properties. <b>Surface</b> and <b>compression</b> properties, however, did not show a significant variation.

50|$|Lobate scarps {{are widely}} {{distributed}} over Mercury and consist of sinuous to arcuatescarps that transect preexisting plains and craters. They are most convincingly interpreted as thrust faults, indicatinga period of global compression. The lobate scarps typically transect smooth plains materials (early Calorianage) {{on the floors}} of craters, but post-Caloris craters are superposed on them. These observations suggest thatlobate-scarp formation was confined to a relatively narrow interval of time, {{beginning in the late}} pre-Tolstojanperiod and ending in the middle to late Calorian Period. In addition to scarps, wrinkle ridges occur in the smoothplains materials. These ridges probably were formed by local to regional <b>surface</b> <b>compression</b> caused by lithosphericloading by dense stacks of volcanic lavas, as suggested for those of the lunar maria.|$|E

The casting may be further strengthened by <b>surface</b> <b>compression</b> treatment - like shot peening - that adds resistance to tensile cracking and smooths the rough surface.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{study for the}} inviscid numerical calculation of the hypersonic flow past a class of elliptic-cone derived waveriders is presented. The theoretical background associated with hypersonic small-disturbance theory (HSDT) is reviewed. Several approximation formulas for the waverider <b>compression</b> <b>surface</b> are established. A CFD algorithm {{is used to calculate}} flow fields for the on-design case and a variety of off-design cases. The results are compared with HSDT, experiment, and other available CFD results. For the waverider shape used in previous investigations, the bow shock for the on-design condition stands off from the leading-edge tip of the waverider. It was found that this occurs because the tip was too thick according to the approximating shape formula that was used to describe the <b>compression</b> <b>surface.</b> When this was corrected, the bow shock became closer to attached as it should be. At Mach numbers greater than the design condition, a lambda-shock configuration develops near the tip of the <b>compression</b> <b>surface.</b> At negative angles of attack, other complicated shock patterns occur near the leading-edge tip. These heretofore unknown flow patterns show the power and utility of CFD for investigating novel hypersonic configurations such as waveriders...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for selecting parameter values in elasto-plastic models for unsaturated soils under isotropic stress states. The proposed method is {{an improvement over}} more traditional calibration approaches as it explicitly takes into account experimental yielding behavior when defining the unsaturated normal <b>compression</b> <b>surface.</b> This is achieved by “enriching” measured yield stresses with corresponding values of specific volume (estimated from the observed elastic and virgin responses), which generates experimental points that can be interpolated together with virgin compression data. The proposed methodology is general and independent of the chosen mathematical forms of normal <b>compression</b> <b>surface,</b> elastic law and constitutive variables. The validity of the method is demonstrated by calibrating a reference model from a set of constant suction isotropic compression tests. Both improved and traditional calibration approaches are employed to select model parameter values which are then used to predict yield curves in the mean net stress–suction plane. Because of the incorporation of yielding data in the interpolation of the normal <b>compression</b> <b>surface,</b> the improved calibration method produces a more accurate prediction of yield stresses at different suctions compared with the standard method. Due to its generality and limited subjectivity, the proposed method provides an unbiased tool to compare {{strengths and weaknesses of}} different constitutive models...|$|R
