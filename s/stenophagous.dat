50|$|Okenia zoobotryon {{seems to}} be a <b>stenophagous</b> feeder, one that {{selectively}} feeds on one organism but is able to feed on others if the main prey species is unavailable. In fact, during feeding trials, adults did not actively select Zoobotryon verticillatum over other possible prey species. Zoobotryon verticillatum contains certain secondary metabolites which make it distasteful to most predators. Okenia zoobotryon feeding on it were found to contain many of the same chemicals and it is likely that these have similar anti-predatory functions in the sea slug.|$|E

30|$|Worldwide, cotton is {{attacked}} by ecologically similar complexes of insect herbivores (see Additional file 1). In India, before {{the widespread use}} of insecticide, the key pest of cotton was the cosmopolitan <b>stenophagous</b> semi-tropical pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella Saunders; hereafter pink bollworm (PBW))) and also generalists such as jassids (Amrasca biguttula Ishida), spotted bollworm (Earias vitella Fabricius), and defoliators such as Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) [8, 9]. PBW is thought to be of South Asian, Papua New Guinea, and North Australian origins [10] and historically has been a pest in long-season cotton grown more than 180  days [2]. Natural control of PBW is weak, and it can cause high late-season damage if not controlled.|$|E
40|$|Descriptions are {{provided}} of the egg, larvae, and puparium of Paracantha gentilis Hering, a native, <b>stenophagous</b> tephritid which infests the capitula of thistles. Detailed examination of larvae {{led to the}} discovery of a median oral lobe between the mouth hooks. This is the first structure of this kind described for Tephritidae. Two sensory structures on the anterior lobes of P. gentilis also were discovered, the lateral sensory organ and the pit sensory organ. In comparing the anterior sensory apparatus of P. gentilis larvae with those in Anthomyiidae, Calliphoridae, Drosophilidae, Muscidae, and Syrphidae, striking similarities were apparent.

Egg clutch sizes ranged from one to 13 eggs, with a maximum of six clutches per capitulum. Larvae fed gregariously within stage-specific niches. Pupariation occurred in the capitula, from which adults emerged in mid-June through early July. After emergence, most adults probably disperse to higher elevations to feed until autumn, then return to lower elevations and reproduce the following year.

40|$|As ilwasions {{of alien}} species mount, {{biological}} control {{will become an}} increasingly important tool of conservation and agriculture. In an effort to understand indirect interactions in biological control, we review food web ecology in terms of resource competition, trophic cascades, intraguild predation, apparent competition, omnivory and a diverse set of tritrophic interactions. The most inclusive study suggests that food webs in biological control are simpler than in natural communities. Risks to non-target species created by biological control have been studied seriously for only about 20 years, and knowledge of these risks is incomplete. The greatest risks {{are known to be}} posed by the organisms with the broadest diets, such as vertebrates and the snail Euglandina rosea, which has probably caused the extinction of an entire genus of native snails in Polynesia. Some parasitoid species have been introduced that are sufficiently polyphagous to attack native insects, and cases of serious harm to non-target populations are now coming to light. However, polyphagous organisms continue to be imported for biological control. One case in point is the campaign against the Russian wheat aphid, in which over 8. 5 million individual invertebrates, including more than 1 million individuals of 12 species of ladybird beetles new to North America, were released over the past 15 years, with little study of potential non-target effects, direct or indirect. Another case is the new use of the polyphagous black carp for suppression of pest snails in industrial catfish ponds. This fish poses great risks to the high native diversity of molluscs in the Mississippi drainage. We argue that risk to native flora in biological control of weeds can be judged before introduction. For the New World, the lowest non-target risk comes from <b>stenophagous</b> insects released against weeds with no native congeners. When weeds have native congeners, introductions of even relatively <b>stenophagous</b> insects have led to the use of non-target, native plants...|$|E

A large sample (n = 368) of the Ladder Snake, Rhinechis scalaris is used.

The latter host record is new; other published host records are questioned. Eggs, first through third instar larvae, and puparia are described {{for the first}} time. Galls formed on both host plants are described. The severe drought in southern California during the last 5 years has reduced the densities of P. stonei on V. d. var. parishii. Fly reproduction was restricted to one generation per year on the few host plant individuals that thrived in favored sites where they received supplemental water (i. e., along drip lines of boulders and margins of paved roads). Adult behaviors described include grooming, feeding, wing displays, courtship, copulation and oviposition. Females typically lay eggs in clusters {{of two or more}} in axillary buds.

40|$|Various, non-exclusive {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} invoked {{to explain the}} observed association between host plant use and speciation in insect species. In the Afrotropical genus Ceratitis (Diptera: Tephritidae), morphological, molecular, and biochemical data suggest that evolutionary radiation of <b>stenophagous</b> clades originates from their ability to exploit toxic hosts. To test whether, and to what extent, the development and fitness of Ceratitis fasciventris, a polyphagous congener known to infest over 43 host species, is adversely affected by host plant toxicity, we compared the rates of development, survival, and reproduction of captive bred individuals in four media that differ in alkaloid concentration. Despite reduced pupal and adult sizes, C. fasciventris larvae developing under low alkaloid concentrations successfully developed to the adult stage, probably {{as a result of}} accelerated pupation and ensuing restricted exposure to the toxic environment. High alkaloid concentrations, however, impaired their developmental process and prevented subsequent reproduction. The adverse effects of host plant toxicity on larval development in polyphagous fruit flies indicate that high alkaloid concentrations pose a significant constraint on host use by polyphagous Ceratitis species...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of stomach contents {{was conducted in}} sandpipers of five species (Calidris alpina, Xenus cinereus, Tringa brevipes, T. glareola, T. hypoleucos) collected on the north coast of the Sea of Ariake. A great number of polychaetes and gastropod molluscs were found in C. alpina, {{and a lot of}} polychaetes were also found in X. cinereus. In T. brevipes only fragments of crabs were found. In both T. glareola and T. hypoleucos were found a number of skeletons of frogs. Analysing the relation between the invertebrates and the aggregation of birds, the distribution of T. brevipes closely related with that of Crustacea, especially that of Brachyura. And the distribution of C. tenuirostris closely related with that of small molluscs. In both C. alpina and X. cinereus, however, no relation was found between their distributions and any specific prey. There seemed to be two types of the sandpipers {{at the time of their}} migration. The first was relatively <b>stenophagous</b> species, such as T. brevipes and C. tenuirostris, which showed the specific preferences to the prey species.

40|$|True predators are characterised by {{capturing}} {{a number}} of prey items during their lifetime and by being generalists. Some true predators are facultative specialists, but very few species are <b>stenophagous</b> specialists that catch only a few closely related prey types. A monophagous true predator that would exploit a single prey species has not been discovered yet. Representatives of the spider family Ammoxenidae {{have been reported to}} have evolved to only catch termites. Here we tested the hypothesis that Ammoxenus amphalodes is a monophagous termite-eater capturing only Hodotermes mossambicus. We studied the trophic niche of A. amphalodes by means of molecular analysis of the gut contents using Next Generation Sequencing. We investigated their willingness to accept alternative prey and observed their specific predatory behaviour and prey capture efficiency. We found all of the 1. 4 million sequences were H. mossambicus. In the laboratory A. amphalodes did not accept any other prey, including other termite species. The spiders attacked the lateral side of the thorax of termites and immobilised them within 1 [*]min. The paralysis efficiency was independent of predator:prey size ratio. The results strongly indicate that A. amphalodes is a monophagous prey specialist, specifically adapted to feed on H. mossambicus...|$|E
40|$|In {{temperate}} areas, dormancy (diapause and/or quiescence) enables herbivorous insect {{species to}} persist and thrive by synchronizing growth and reproduction with the seasonal phenology of their host plants. Within-population variability in dormancy increases survival chances under unpredictable environmental changes. However, prolonged dormancy may be costly, incurring trade-offs in important adult fitness traits such as life span and reproduction. We used the European cherry fruit fly. Rhagoletis cerasi, a <b>stenophagous,</b> univoltine species that overwinters in the pupal stage for usually {{one or more}} years to test the hypotheses that prolonged dormancy of pupae has trade-offs with body size, survival and reproduction of the resulting adults. We used two geographically isolated populations of R. cerasi to compare the demographic traits of adults obtained from pupae subjected {{to one or two}} cycles of warm-cold periods (annual and prolonged dormancy respectively). Regardless of population, adults from pupae that experienced prolonged dormancy were larger than counterparts emerging within 1 year. Prolonged dormancy did not affect adult longevity but both lifetime fecundity and oviposition were significantly decreased. Extension of the life cycle of some individuals in R. cerasi populations in association with prolonged dormancy is likely a bet-hedging strategy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the evolution of}} local adaptation, the interplay between natural selection and gene flow should be considered. Rhagoletis cerasi L. (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a patchily distributed, <b>stenophagous</b> species of the temperate zone, and the geographical structure of its populations reveals substantial variation in gene flow rates across its distribution range. We studied the demographic components of R. cerasi adults from Greek and German populations by estimating the variability in fitness traits among allopatric populations, as well as among geographically discrete populations, with gene flow. Assuming that body size may exert {{a profound effect on}} adult fitness, both thorax and head sizes were considered as covariates in our analyses. Our data demonstrated that females were larger than males in all populations, and adult size varied significantly among populations within groups. Significant differences in a suite of life-history traits of R. cerasi adults were detected among populations with gene flow, whereas there were no consistent differences among allopatric populations. Therefore, the genetic differences among R. cerasi populations, driven mainly by geographical isolation, are poor predictors of variation in the life-history traits of adults.

40|$|Current {{knowledge}} about polysphinctine parasite wasps' interactions with their spider hosts is very fragmented and incomplete. This study presents the host specificity of Zatypota percontatoria (Müller) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) and its adaptation to varying host availability. Two years of field observations show that Z. percontatoria is a <b>stenophagous</b> parasitoid that parasitizes only five closely related web-building spiders {{of the family}} Theridiidae (Araneae). Within the Theridiidae it attacks only species belonging to {{a small group of}} species, here called the “Theridion” group. These hosts have a similar biology, but are available at different levels of abundance and at different sizes over the season. Laboratory experiments showed that this wasp species ignores linyphiid, araneid or dictynid spiders and accepts only theridiid spiders of the “Theridion” group. In the field study, wasp females preferred older juvenile and sub-adult female spider instars with intermediate body size. Only 5 % of the parasitized spiders were males. Parasitism in the natural population of theridiid spiders was on average 1. 3 %. Parasitism was most frequent on two species, Theridion varians Hahn in 2007 and Neottiura bimaculata Linnaeus in 2008. The parasitization rate was positively correlated with spider abundance. The wasp responded adaptively to seasonal changes in host abundance and host body size and shifted host preference according to the availability of suitable hosts during, as well as between, seasons. In spring and summer the highest percentage of parasitism was on T. varians and in autumn it was on N. bimaculata...|$|E
40|$|Field {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} during 2005 to 2007 {{to assess the}} species diversity of stem borer parasitoids in cultivated and natural habitats in four agroecological zones in Kenya. In total, 33 parasitoid species were recovered, of which 18 parasitized six stem borer species feeding on cereal crops, while 27 parasitized 21 stem borer species feeding on 19 wild host plant species. The most common parasitoids in cultivated habitats were Cotesia flavipes Cameron, Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron), Pediobius furvus Gahan and the tachinid Siphona sp., whereas in natural habitats, Siphona sp. {{was the most common}}. The majority of parasitoids were <b>stenophagous</b> species; only five species - Cotesia sp., Enicospilus ruscus Gauld and Mitchell, Pristomerus nr. bullis, Sturmiopsis parasitica (Curran) and Syzeuctus ruberrimus Benoit - were monophagous. In both cultivated and natural habitats, parasitoid species diversity was highest on the most dominant stem borers Busseola spp. and Chilo spp. On cereal crops, parasitoid diversity was highest on maize and among wild host plants, it was highest on Setaria spp. The ingress-and-sting attack method was the most common strategy used by parasitoids in both habitats. In all agroecological zones, parasitoid species diversity was significantly higher in natural than in cultivated habitats. Furthermore, the majority of parasitoid species were common to both cultivated and natural habitats. It was concluded that natural habitats surrounding cereal crops serve as refugia for sustaining the diversity of stem borer parasitoids from adjacent cereal fields...|$|E
40|$|Persistence and {{thriving}} of univoltine, herbivore insect {{species of}} the temperate zone rely on obligate diapause response that ensures winter survival and synchronization with host phenology. We used a <b>stenophagous</b> fruit fly (Rhagoletis cerasi) with obligate pupae diapause to determine genetic and environmental effects on diapause intensity of geographically isolated populations with habitat heterogeneity. Pupae from two Greek and one German populations with various gene flow rates were exposed at five constant chilling temperatures (0 - 12 degrees C) for different durations and then incubated at a high temperature until all adults have emerged. Pupae diapause intensity differs among Greek and German populations, suggesting an adaptive response to habitat heterogeneity (mostly differences in phenology patterns of local host cultivars). Moderately warm winter temperatures, such as 8 degrees C, promote diapause termination in all three populations. Insufficient chilling (short duration or warmer temperatures) regulates the expression of prolonged dormancy. Interestingly, extended chilling (longer than required for terminating diapause) return' pupae to another (facultative) cycle of dormancy enabling adults to emerge during the next appropriate window of time'; a strategy first time reported for univoltine insects. Consequently, diapause duration of R. cerasi is determined both by i) the adaptive response to local climatic conditions (annual dormancy) and ii) the plastic responses to interannual climatic variability resulting in two types of long life cycles within populations, prolonged and facultative dormancy as response to insufficient chilling and extended exposure to chilling, respectively. Long life cycles are expressed {{as a part of}} dormancy bet-hedging strategies of R. cerasi populations...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary stable {{nitrogen}} and carbon isotope analysis was undertaken {{to investigate whether}} the resulting data support current knowledge of diet as obtained by conventional approaches. Blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (B. physalus) and Bryde's (B. edeni) whales co-occur temporally and are known to feed in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Isotope measurements were taken from: known prey (three euphausiids and four sardine samples); skin biopsies (two for each whale species); and from faeces (one blue and three fin whale samples). Although the sample size was small, the range of ä 15 N values obtained was consistent with prior knowledge of the whales feeding habits, with values increasing in the order: blue (x= 12. 9), fin (x= 15. 4) and Bryde's whales (x= 15. 8). The low value for the blue whale confirms its known <b>stenophagous</b> habit. The closeness of d 15 N values for fin and Bryde's whales coincides with the known icthyophagous habits of the Bryde's whale and the more generalist fin whale which feeds on both fish and zooplankton. The difference in ä 13 C values for fin (x= 16. 0) and Bryde's whales (x= 18. 1) suggests that although they feed at the same trophic level, they might use different food sources or feeding sites. Results of ä 15 N suggest that fin and Bryde's whales share the same relative trophic level, blue whales and juvenile sardines (S. sagax) share a lower position, followed by the euphausiid (Nematocelis difficilis) and fin whale faeces, and at the lowest level blue whale faeces...|$|E
40|$|Stomach {{contents}} of 204 individuals {{of the common}} stingray, Dasyatis pastinaca, caught in the seas surrounding Sardinia (central-western Mediterranean), were analysed to assess the feeding ecology and the ontogenetic shifts in the diet. Specimens, 138 to 377 mm in DW, were collected from 2008 to 2010, during experimental trawl surveys (MEDITS and GRUND) conducted at depths between 27 and 56 m. Of all stomachs analysed, 20 were empty (%Cv = 9. 8). In the remaining 184, 7 major prey taxa were found: Crustacea, Osteichthyes, Chondrichthyes, Mollusca, Polychaeta, Echinodermata and Cephalochordata. The low Levin’s index value (Bi = 0. 04) indicated a strong <b>stenophagous</b> feeding behavior. Crustaceans (%IRItot = 91. 6) were the most common preys. The diet was completed by Osteichthyes (%IRItot = 4. 38) and Polychaetes (%IRItot = 3. 99), while the other preys were occasional. Mysids, and particularly Gastrosaccus sanctus (%IRI = 58, 9) were of fundamental importance among Crustaceans. Trophic level value (TROPH = 3. 30 ± 0. 43 s. e.) reflected the high relevance of these preys. The ontogenetic analysis of the diet, conducted on three size groups (89 immature, 96 subadults and 19 adults), revealed some differences in the feeding habits. During growth individuals seemed to replace small Crustaceans, as Mysids, with bigger and more mobile preys, as Decapod Crustaceans in subadults and Osteichthyes in adults. However, no statistical differences were found among diets. These ontogenetic shifts were, in fact, too slight to avoid competition, as revealed also by the high values of the Morisita’s index (CH = 0. 99 between immature and subadults) ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Environmental Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The {{environmental}} impacts of genetically modified (GM) crop plants such as Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) maize {{have not yet been}} fully assessed in South Africa. Bt maize designed to express Bt endotoxin for control of Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) is planted on approximately 1. 103 million hectares in South Africa. The monitoring of GM crops after release is important in order to assess and evaluate possible environmental effects. No risk assessment for Bt maize was done in South Africa before its release in 1998 and no targeted post-release monitoring of possible resistance development or impact on non-target species have been done. Awareness has risen in South Africa through research highlighting the possible effects GM crops may have. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine, through feeding experiments, the effects of Bt maize on selected non-target Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Diptera species that occur in maize agro-ecosystems in South Africa. Results provide information for use in future risk assessment studies on Bt maize and indicate which species could possibly be of importance in post-release monitoring of Bt maize. Priority insect species were identified and laboratory- and semifield experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of Bt maize on these species. In the light of the reportedly lower toxicity of Bt maize to certain noctuid borers, the effect of Bt maize was evaluated on Sesamia calamistis (Hampson), Agrotis segetum (Denis & Schiffermüller), and Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner). Feeding studies were also conducted to determine the effect of Bt maize on non-target Coleoptera, i. e. Heteronychus arator Fabricius (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) and Somaticus angulatus (Fahraeus) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). The effect of indirect exposure of the stem borer parasitoid Sturmiopsis parasitica (Curran) (Diptera: Tachinidae) to Bt toxin was evaluated to determine if there is any effect when it parasitizes Bt-resistant B. fusca larvae that have fed on Bt maize. Results from the study conducted with S. calamistis indicated that Bt maize of both events (Bt 11 and MON 810) were highly toxic to S. calamistis. The behavioural characteristic of S. calamistis to feed behind leaf sheaths and to enter stems directly did not result in escape of exposure to the toxin. Larval feeding on leaf sheaths therefore resulted in the ingestion of sufficient toxin to kill larvae before they entered maize stems. Results showed that the effect of Cry 1 Ab toxin on the biology of A. segetum larvae and moths were largely insignificant. Whorl leaves were observed to be an unsuitable food source for H. armigera larvae and larval growth was poor. No larvae survived to the pupal stage on any of the Bt maize treatments. When feeding on maize ears H. armigera larval mass increased on non-Bt maize whereas no increase occurred on Bt maize. The feeding study conducted with Coleoptera showed that the effect of Bt maize on H. arator and S. angulatus was insignificant and no differences were observed in any of the parameters measured for the two species. Although not always significant, the percentage parasitism of Bt-consuming host larvae by S. parasitica was always higher compared to host larvae that fed on non-Bt maize. It could be that Bt toxin affects B. fusca fitness to such an extent that the immune systems of host larvae were less effective. The different parameters tested for S. parasitica indicated only one case where fly maggots originating from diapause host larvae feeding on non-Bt maize had a greater mass compared to host larvae that fed on Bt maize. The same applied to S. parasitica pupal length. For other parameters tested there were no significant differences. Sesamia calamistis is <b>stenophagous</b> and occurs in mixed populations with other borer species. It was therefore concluded that the ecological impact of local extinctions of S. calamistis caused by Bt maize is not expected to be great. Bt maize will most likely not have any significant effect on the control of A. segetum under field conditions. The feeding study conducted with H. armigera quantified the effects of Bt maize on this species and provided important information on the potential of Bt maize as protection against this polyphagous pest. However, the likelihood of H. armigera becoming an important secondary pest is high. It can be concluded that the Cry 1 Ab toxin targeting lepidopteran pests will not have adverse effects on H. arator or S. angulatus. Although some adverse effects were observed on S. parasitica mass and pupal length it is most likely that this will not contribute to adverse effects in the field, but that there rather be synergism between Bt maize and S. parasitica. An ecological approach was followed in which the potential effects of exposure of priority species to Bt toxin in maize was investigated. A series of selection matrixes were developed in which each of the above mentioned species was ranked for its maximum potential exposure to Bt toxin by assessing it occurrence, abundance, presence and linkage in the maize ecosystem. Through the use of these selection matrixes, knowledge gaps were identified for future research and to guide the design of ecologically realistic experiments. This study contributes to knowledge regarding the possible effects of Bt maize on the most economically important non-target pests in South Africa. There is, however, a need to evaluate other non-target species in feeding studies, as well as in field studies. From this study it can be concluded that some species can be eliminated from further testing since Bt maize had no adverse effect while more research have to be conducted on other species.
