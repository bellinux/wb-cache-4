5|$|The {{premise of}} a repentant murderer seeking {{to atone for}} their actions {{appears to have been}} based on the real-life case of Albert Fish, who practised severe self-harm after killing twelve-year-old Grace Budd. Fish would insert needles into his {{perineum}} and force rose stems along his urethra to be forcibly pulled out. However, the actual murders may have been inspired by the case of <b>Susan</b> <b>Smith,</b> a mother of two who drowned her children by sinking her car in a lake. Mention is also made in the episode of Arthur Shawcross, whose recidivism is cited by Garry's prosecutors as an example of why murder should warrant a death penalty. Shawcross was released from prison after serving a sentence for killing two children, only to kill eleven women while on parole.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1931, Le Goff's {{father was}} a French cavalry officer. Jack began riding early, and during his teenage years competed as a steeplechase jockey, as well as showing in dressage, showjumping, and eventing. At the age of seventeen, {{after the death of}} his father, Le Goff joined the French {{military}} and began riding for Cadre Noir, the national riding academy. After his training, he became a riding master at the school and he remained in this position for a decade. As a French soldier he fought in the Algerian War after his appearance in the 1960 Olympic Games. Le Goff competed in two Olympic Games, in 1960 and 1964. In 1960, at the Roma Games, he finished sixth individually and helped the French team to a bronze medal. At the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, he finished twenty-third individually, while the French team came in eighth. He was also the French national eventing champion in 1956 and 1964.

25|$|By the mid-1960s, Jones had {{developed}} a habit for appearing drunk on stage, and was already known as a troublemaker. He had married twice, once to Dorothy Bonvillion in 1950; however, the two filed for divorce in 1951. His first daughter, <b>Susan</b> <b>Smith,</b> was born on October 29, 1951. He remarried in 1954 to Shirley Ann Corley. On October 9, 1955, his first son, Jeffrey Glenn Jones, was born and on July 16, 1958, his second son, Brian Daily Jones, was born. However, through extensive tours and recording sessions, Jones's dependence on alcohol and pills drove his second wife away, and they divorced in 1968.|$|E
25|$|Reverend John Dunbar (1856–1925): His {{father was}} John Dunbar (born 1820 in Ireland), a bootmaker {{employing}} {{one person in}} 1861. His mother was <b>Susan</b> <b>Smith</b> (born 1819 in Bolton), working {{in the manufacture of}} buckets and hose in the same year, when they were living at 26 Blair Street, Toxteth Park, Liverpool. They married in 1842 in West Derby. John, the youngest of five siblings, was born in Liverpool in 1856. The 1871 Census finds the family at the same address, with only two of John's siblings present: a pupil teacher and an apprentice watchmaker. He graduated from St Aidan's College, Durham 1878. He was ordained deacon 1880, and priest 1881 by the Bishop of Chester. He was curate of St Peter's Church, Rock Ferry, Birkenhead 1880–1884.

500|$|Elements of [...] "Covenant" [...] were {{inspired}} by real-life murderers Albert Fish, <b>Susan</b> <b>Smith</b> and Arthur Shawcross. The episode was viewed by approximately 6.7 million households in its original broadcast. It has received positive reviews, with Moresco's script praised for its subtlety.|$|E
500|$|Authors Cheryl Meyer, Michelle Oberman, and Michelle Rone, {{discussing}} the Green case {{in their book}} Mothers Who Kill Their Children: Understanding the Acts of Moms from <b>Susan</b> <b>Smith</b> to the [...] "Prom Mom", point out that Green was adjudged psychologically competent at what would be commonly considered the least-controlled point of any mental illness from which she was suffering: {{she was on a}} cocktail of drugs which could treat the symptoms of mental illness but not the illness itself, she had been drinking alcohol in amounts which she had been warned could interfere with her medications, and she was coping with the loss of her children. Nevertheless, she spoke for her own mental competence at the time, a judgment which was echoed by the court. Meyer, Oberman, and Rone speculate that Green could meet the diagnostic criteria for several mental illnesses, including antisocial personality disorder, but add that the fact that her crimes were a combination of impulsive—arson and the murder of her children—and premeditated—the poisoning of Michael Farrar—makes any mental illness [...] extremely difficult to diagnose.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B+, praising Moresco's script for its subtlety. VanDerWerff noted the premise's similarity to the <b>Susan</b> <b>Smith</b> case, {{and felt that}} the episode [...] "actually gains strength from a certain distance from when it originally aired. Back then, {{it was just another}} ripped-from-the-headlines tale of a murderous mother. Now, it’s a crafty mystery that doesn’t reveal its cards until late". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4 out of 5, noting that the episode [...] "broke clichés and trampled all over formulas". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Covenant" [...] four-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it [...] "Millennium's version of Twelve Angry Men". Shearman praised Morseco's writing, noting that the episode was [...] "tightly plotted and boast extremely good dialogue". Shearman felt that Koskoff's acting showed a [...] "naivety that isn't as subtle as the script demands", but overall felt that the episode was [...] "fresh and exciting".|$|E

2500|$|Issues arose after Santorum was {{defeated}} for re-election to the Senate in 2006, and Senator Craig Thomas began his {{tenure at the}} candy desk. Wyoming, the state he was representing, has no members of the National Confectioners Association, and therefore no candymakers large enough to donate hundreds of dollars of candy to fill the desk. Senate ethics rules [...] "forbid members accepting gifts worth $100 or more a year from a single source," [...] which can become a problem if {{a large amount of}} candy is consumed from the desk each year. An exception to this rule allows larger gifts of objects created or produced in the state the senator is from, as long as the items are primarily not used by the senator and his staff. This is so senators can [...] "offer visitors home-grown snacks, such as Florida orange juice or Georgia peanuts." [...] When asked about Thomas being in charge of the candy desk, <b>Susan</b> <b>Smith,</b> a representative from the National Confectioners Association, stated, [...] "We're happy to provide candy if there are [...] members...It would be difficult for us to do now." [...] These issues were worked around by asking many small, local, Wyoming confectionery businesses and chocolatiers to give small amounts of candy that were rotated {{in and out of the}} desk.|$|E
