40|$|William Edmond Logan assumed {{his duties}} {{as the first}} head of the Geological Survey of Canada in June 1843. Two {{previously}} overlooked field notebooks provide new insight into his first field project that summer: measurement of the “Joggins section, ” a classic Carboniferous locality in Nova Scotia. Inspired by reports of 40 -foot-tall fossil trees, Logan spent five days measuring 14 570 feet 11 inches of strata exposed along {{the shore of the}} Bay of Fundy. Widely regarded as a meticulous, bed-by-bed <b>measured</b> <b>section,</b> closer examination reveals that many thickness values were calculated using paced distances. Realizing that his <b>measured</b> <b>section</b> was too detailed for scientific journals of the day, Logan published his work in a relatively obscure government publication where it went largely unnoticed for nearly a decade. Unaware of Logan’s <b>measured</b> <b>section,</b> John William Dawson and Charles Lyell visited Joggins in 1852 and <b>measured</b> the <b>section</b> for themselves. Dawson later stated that the two sections contain only minor differences, but careful comparison shows that they have radically different descriptions and measurements for even the most dis-tinctive beds. Dawson disguised these discrepancies in post- 1855 editions of his book Acadian Geology by rewriting much of the <b>measured</b> <b>section</b> and abandoning many of his own observations. Although over 200 subsequent Joggins studies build upon these <b>measured</b> <b>sections,</b> the present study represents the first detailed examination of the two historical sections and reveals previously unknown discrepancies between two of the most important early geologi...|$|R

40|$|The Digital Integrated Stratigraphy Project (DISP) aims to {{eliminate}} the stratigraphical ambiguity associated with sample position within a stratigraphical section. For example, it is often impractical or impossible to compare one author’s <b>measured</b> <b>section</b> and data precisely against another author’s geographically identical <b>measured</b> <b>section</b> and data due to discrepancies in the measured thicknesses of units, variations in the assignments of litho- and chronostratigraphical terms, and/or the precise line of <b>measured</b> <b>sections</b> between authors. The DISP will provide {{a solution to this}} problem by producing a precise 3 -D digital rendering of the exposure using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) LiDAR, Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), overlain digital photography, and GIS software to produce a cm to mm-scale accurate digital version of a given exposure. Once available online as a permanent web-based digital resource for stratigraphy, researchers will be able to access the program and digital models of scanned exposures where they will have the means to log their sample positions directly onto the digital exposure while in the field, thus allowing unambiguous stratigraphical reference for future comparison. The Digital Integrated Stratigraphy Project represents the next generation of stratigraphical standard and can serve as the protocol for the future of high-resolution Palaeozoic Earth history research. ...|$|R
