5000|$|This sensor {{works because}} Infrared light is absorbed {{by a variety}} of gases at {{different}} wavelengths within the spectrum including methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and oxygen. To measure the concentration, a beam of light is emitted into the air sample. By measuring the difference between the input and output of the infrared beam, the sensor can determine the amount of the trace gases in the sample. [...] It is common for an infrared gas analyzer to have two configurations. The [...] "open design" [...] operates by shooting a beam of infrared light through the air outside of the <b>sensor</b> <b>body.</b> Meanwhile, the closed design works by sucking air into the <b>sensor</b> <b>body</b> measuring the concentration of trace gases inside of a sealed chamber. Usually, open sensors are placed within half a meter of the anemometer while closed sensors use a collection tube mounted inside the anemometer to get their air sample.|$|E
5000|$|MAFless tuning is {{a popular}} {{modification}} in Australia for Holden vehicles powered by the General Motors LS1 Gen III 5.7 V8 engine. The genesis for MAFless tuning of the LS1 in Australia was the HSV GTS version of the Holden Commodore, which was factory fitted with a Callaway-developed C4B version of that engine running in MAFless mode. Rated at 300 kW, the C4B was the most powerful factory LS1 sold in Australia and created substantial credibility for MAFless tuning of LS1 V8s. Within days of the HSV GTS's release the CSV Veloce was on the Australian market with a 330 kW LS1 incorporating a MAFless configuration. The MAFless configuration was later dropped by HSV and subsequent cars have all had MAF's. MAFless tuned LS engine equipped vehicles never eventuated in the United States as the C5 Corvette with the same engine was always fitted with a MAF sensor. It featured a larger MAF <b>sensor</b> <b>body</b> than the ones installed in the Australian cars, to avoid any intake restriction issues and still deliver accurate injection at all times.|$|E
5000|$|While {{heat flux}} {{sensors can be}} made {{according}} to various designs, the sensor of a Gardon gauge consists of a foil connected to the <b>sensor</b> <b>body</b> at its external radius, and connected to a thin wire at the center, named after its originator Robert Gardon. The foil center and side are the hot- and cold joint of a thermocouple respectively. When radiation hits the sensor this generates a signal. It is typically water-cooled and does not require any power to operate.A so-called Schmidt-Boelter Gauge has the same outward appearance as a Gardon Gauge, but employs different sensor technology. The Schmidt-Boelter has a plated constantan wire wrapped around an insulating chip. Both are heat flux sensors. The only difference is practical; Gardon gauges can be manufactured {{in such a way}} that they withstand extremely high flux levels. The range for Schmidt-Boelter technology is more limited. On the other hand the Schmidt-Boelter technology can reach higher sensitivities at a lower response time.Please note: Images on this page are of a Schmidt-Boelter gauge. While of similar appearance externally, the internal construction is not that of a Gardon gauge. Construction of both is detailed in the explanation.|$|E

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} {{of a mixed}} potential electrochemical sensor {{is determined by the}} concentration of the analyte gas at the gas/electrode/electrolyte interface. These concentrations, along with the kinetic properties of the three-phase interface and oxygen partial pressure, establish the mixed potential generated by the device. The selectivity of mixed potential sensors is therefore strongly influenced by the heterogeneous catalytic properties of the surfaces that closely surround the sensor including: the metal oxide electrode, solid electrolyte, other components of the <b>sensor</b> <b>body,</b> and the sensor enclosure. Analysis of the change in CO, C 3 H 6, and C 3 H 8 concentration using gas chromatography shows that the observed preferential {{sensitivity of}} a LaCrO 3 //YSZ//Pt bulk mixed potential sensor towards C 3 H 8 is largely due to heterogeneous catalysis of the C 3 H 6 on the <b>sensor</b> <b>body,</b> which in this work, is YSZ.

Although a similar amount of heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of CO takes place, the LaCrO 3 //YSZ//Pt sensor exhibits only a small response to CO and this therefore may be associated with the electrode kinetics and electrocatalytic properties of the sensor interface towards the electro-oxidation of the CO.
