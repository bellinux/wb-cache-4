In this {{demonstration}} 1 we present {{an approach to}} engineering service brokering requirements and capabilities using the concepts of <b>Service</b> <b>Modes.</b> The demonstration illustrates building <b>service</b> <b>modes</b> in UML 2 with Rational Software Modeller, transforming modes in WS-Engineer and generating artefacts for runtime service brokering. 1 The <b>Service</b> <b>Modes</b> Approach A mode, {{in the context of}} service engineering, aims to provide an easily accessible mechanism for developing adaptive service brokering requirements. <b>Service</b> <b>modes</b> are an abstraction of a set of services that collaborate to achieve a task or sub-tasks. A <b>Service</b> <b>Modes</b> Architecture consists of specifying the service components, their configuration and behaviour required or provided, and their interface specifications. We developed and apply a UML <b>Service</b> <b>Modes</b> Profile [1] to identify various elements of the service configuration elements for service brokering, and reuse this in the approach to identify required and provided <b>services</b> in <b>modes.</b> A <b>service</b> <b>modes</b> model consists of a number of mode packages, whic...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Product Service System (PSS) is {{introduced}} {{as a new}} concept which means the products and services can be integrated to a package and delivered to customer. From the definition and classification, a PSS {{can be seen as}} a system including a set of <b>servicing</b> <b>modes</b> of product. Therefore, designing appropriate PSS to satisfy customer requirements is an important issue in current research. This article reviews current design methodologies and categorized them into three patterns. Each pattern has its advantages and limitations. Hence a new design approach is proposed in this paper. This approach includes integral develop process and focuses on the conceptual design of PSS, which requires innovative thinking to identify possible <b>servicing</b> <b>modes</b> according to customer requirements.

40|$|In {{this article}} we propose a {{framework}} for analysing internationalisation processes, manifested through a sequence of <b>servicing</b> <b>modes.</b> A <b>servicing</b> turn is, in turn, the institutional arrangement whereby firms operate in foreign markets. The framework borrows conceptual notions from the literature on foreign market entry, internationalisation and subsidiary development. Three implications for empirical studies are subsequently suggested. First, {{it is argued that}} internationalisation processes should be analysed in light of intra and inter-organisational relationships embedded in distinct spatial and temporal contexts. Secondly, the framework takes into account not only incremental but also discontinuous internationalisation processes. Thirdly, it is proposed that internationalisation processes are endless phenomena and, therefore, should consider sequences of <b>servicing</b> <b>modes</b> that take place in the foreign market where the entry mode is originally embedded as well as in foreign markets reached from the initial host country...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Autonomic {{computing}} networks manage multiple tasks over a {{distributed network}} of resources. In this paper, we view an autonomic computing {{system as a}} network of queues, where classes of jobs/tasks are stored awaiting execution. At each point in time, local resources are allocated according to the backlog of waiting jobs. <b>Service</b> <b>modes</b> are selected corresponding to feasible configurations of computing (processors, CPU cycles, etc.), communication (slots, channels, etc.) and storage resources (shared buffers, memory places, etc.) We present a family of distributed algorithms which maximize the system throughput by dynamically choosing <b>service</b> <b>modes</b> in response to observed buffer backlogs. This class of policies, called projective cone scheduling algorithms, are related to maximum pressure policies in constrained queueing networks, and are shown to maintain stability under any arrival combination within the network capacity. They operate without knowledge of the arrival rates and require minimal information sharing between regions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically {{investigate}} the relationship between cross border trade in <b>services</b> (<b>Mode</b> 1) and commercial presence in <b>services</b> (<b>Mode</b> 3). I postulate that these two modes of supply facilitate each other, and that, in contrast to the manufacturing sector, this complementarity might occur even at the level of horizontal investment. For the empirical analysis I make use of bilateral data on US majority-owned foreign affiliate operations (MOFAs). The same exercise is carried for the case of goods sectors. After using two different estimating techniques, results confirm the intuition, not only Mode 1 and <b>Mode</b> 3 in <b>services</b> are complements but also the complementarity relationship is stronger than that found in the case of goods. Moreover, the complementarity between this two modes of supply, for the case of services, is also found at the level of horizontal FDI. international trade in services; modes of supply; FDI...|$|R

50|$|The {{story begins}} in the year 3870, with Galact-Captain Ivan Tamantsev of the Confederacy of Suns {{defending}} an unarmed convoy {{from a group of}} pirate ships. Despite managing to destroy four of the attacking ships, Tamantsev loses his wingman and is himself forced to eject, after his fighter sustains heavy damage. His escape pod is towed by the pirates to their homeworld of Ganio, settled by colonists of Middle Eastern descent. Tamantsev is brought before Faizullah of the Javgeth Clan, the man who ordered the raid on the convoy. He explains to the Captain his options: he can either agree to temporary employment by the Clans as a pilot, until he pays off the destruction of the four fighters and their AI modules (the fighters were unmanned), or Faizullah can let him go with the knowledge that Tamantsev will not survive long on the desert world. While Ivan agrees to fly missions for Faizullah (fully aware that the Ganian intends to go back on his word), he demands to personally inspect his fighter. Upon arriving to the hangar, he sees that it is an ancient Phantom-class aerospace fighter from the days of the First Galactic War with the Earth Alliance. While he shudders at the thought of flying this 1500-year-old antique, Ivan knows that this is his best shot of escaping the planet. Faizullahs engineers agree to let him inside the fighter, as they have disabled all of the crafts AI functions. However, they underestimate the Confederate pilot training, and Tamantsev is able to restart the systems in <b>service</b> <b>mode</b> and launch the ship manually.|$|E
