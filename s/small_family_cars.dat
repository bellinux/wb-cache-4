25|$|Its 1959 Anglia two-door saloon {{was one of}} {{the most}} quirky-looking <b>small</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> in Europe at the time of its launch, but buyers soon became {{accustomed}} to its looks and it was hugely popular with British buyers in particular. It was still selling well when replaced by the more practical Escort in 1967.|$|E
25|$|A hot hatch is a {{high-performance}} hatchback, based on standard superminis or <b>small</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> with improved performance, handling and styling. Hot hatches are {{very popular in}} Europe, where hatchbacks {{are by far the}} most common body style for this size of car. In North America, sport compacts are usually sold as saloons or coupés rather than hatchbacks.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{generation}} Escort was produced from 1990 until 2000, although its successor – the Focus – {{had been on}} sale since 1998.

25|$|Underneath the bonnet was the Kent Crossflow engine {{also used}} in the {{smallest}} capacity North American Ford Pinto. Diesel engines on <b>small</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> were rare, and the Escort was no exception, initially featuring only petrol engines– in 1.1L, and 1.3L versions. A 940 cc engine was also available in some export markets such as Italy and France. This tiny engine remained popular in Italy, where it was carried over for the Escort Mark II, but in France it was discontinued during 1972.|$|E
25|$|Goa's public {{transport}} largely consists of privately operated buses linking the major towns to rural areas. Government-run buses, {{maintained by the}} Kadamba Transport Corporation, link major routes (like the Panaji–Margao route) and some remote parts of the state. The Corporation owns 15 bus stands, 4 depots and one Central workshop at Porvorim and a Head Office at Porvorim. In large towns such as Panajiand Margao, intra-city buses operate. However, {{public transport}} in Goa is less developed, and residents depend heavily on their own transportation, usually motorised two-wheelers and <b>small</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|E
25|$|The pivotal model {{emerged as}} the Volkswagen Golf in 1974, marketed in the United States and Canada as the Rabbit for the 1st {{generation}} (1975–1985) and 5th generation (2006–2009). Its angular styling was designed by the Italian Giorgetto Giugiaro). Its design followed trends for <b>small</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> set by the 1959 Mini– the Golf had a transversely mounted, water-cooled engine in the front, driving the front wheels, and had a hatchback, a format that has dominated the market segment ever since. Beetle production at Wolfsburg ended upon the Golf's introduction. It continued in smaller numbers at other German factories (Hanover and Emden) until 1978, but mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico.|$|E

2500|$|The term MPI (Multi-Point Injection) {{is used by}} Škoda to {{differentiate}} from 16v models and (in {{the case of the}} Octavia Mk2) FSI engines. The [...] version of the 1.4 16v was only mated to Volkswagen's four-speed automatic transmission with fuzzy logic operation until the addition of earlier Sport models which mated it with a manual transmission. The 1.4 8v was dropped in 2003. The Fabia's overall performance and fuel consumption figures fall behind other city cars and <b>small</b> <b>family</b> <b>cars</b> as it is larger and heavier. However, the 1.2 HTP (High Torque Performance) engine was developed specifically for the Fabia and offers better performance and fuel economy, and was later used in Volkswagen's own Polo due to its high acclaim. It was also the highest displacement 3 cylinder petrol engine until 2014 and BMW's 1.5 litre 3 cylinder turbo engine.|$|E
