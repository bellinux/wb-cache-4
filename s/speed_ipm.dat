40|$|Persistent, {{transient}} and, very recently, {{pulse width}} modulated voltage excitation are employed to track saliency of IPM machines, aiming at estimating rotor position. In this paper current transient response introduced by standard (or slightly modified) PWM excitation is considered and analytical relationship between phase current derivatives, inductance and rotor position is derived. A complete mathematical model is {{developed in the}} case of IPM machine, by taking also into account the dependence of the rotor position estimation error on the mutual inductance, which is neglected in the past literature adopting the same sensorless approach. Estimation is performed within a single PWM period, differently from previous approaches. Measurement of current derivatives is obtained from dedicated Rogowski coils, oversampling and real-time processing of the measured values. Acquisition issues due to short application times of voltage vector (e. g. during zero and low speed operations) have been overcome by means of a proper edge-shifting technique on the PWM signals. A motor drive system for fractional power high <b>speed</b> <b>IPM</b> motor is considered as a test bench to prove the effectiveness of the proposal...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a feed-forward torque control (FTC) technique for interior permanent magnet (IPM) brushless AC (BLAC) drives in traction applications. It is shown that by adopting the Newton-Raphson iterative method for solving the proposed high-order nonlinear {{relationship between the}} torque demand, flux-linkage and desirable dq-axis currents, FTC with due account of nonlinear machine parameters can be achieved for IPM BLAC drives. It is also proven that the comparison between the reference voltage magnitudes under maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) and field-weakening (FW) operations together with online base speed determination can be utilized for FW operation activation to achieve full exploitation of the available DC-link voltage during the transition between the constant torque and FW operation regions. Since both the dqaxis current references and the base speed for FW operation activation are computed online, the proposed FTC technique provides flexibility for online parameter update or estimation {{and is able to}} cope with wide DC-link voltage variation. The proposed FTC strategy is experimentally validated by measurements on a 10 kW wide constant power <b>speed</b> range (CPSR) <b>IPM</b> BLAC machine drive...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{additive}} manufacturing is an emerging technology in metals manufacturing. Additive manufacturing differs from traditional manufacturing techniques as it constructs parts layer by layer through an iterative process. This {{method of manufacturing}} offers a number of advantages including cost benefits {{and the ability to}} construct complex geometrical parts through a single process. However, there are challenges involved in {{additive manufacturing}} such as the variability from machine to machine and the complex thermal history inherent in additive processes. This research investigates the effect of thermal cycling due to subsequent layer addition during direct laser deposition of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. This first required optimisation of the powder feed rate, laser scanning speed and laser power of the LENS 450 system. It was determined that a powder feed rate of 4 RPM (~ 4. 05 g/min), a scanning <b>speed</b> of 20 <b>ipm</b> and laser power of 350 W produced samples of the highest density, resulting in less than 1 % porosity and hardness of 334 HV Â± 16 HV in samples using these parameters. Using these settings, samples of different numbers of layers were produced {{to examine the effects of}} thermal cycling. While it was determined that the hardness of samples decreased with increasing build height due to decreasing cooling rates, it was concluded that there was no significant change in microstructure or properties with subsequent layer addition resulting from thermal cycling...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, several {{essential}} improvements of the sensorless direct {{torque control}} (DTC) strategy for interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous motor drives are presented. The studies comprising of analytical, modeling and experimental implementation clearly indicate {{the potential of}} a high-performance direct torque controlled IPM synchronous motor drive without a mechanical encoder. The DTC technique and its associated problems have been further investigated in this thesis. Its major drawback namely the high torque and flux ripples are remedied by the proposed direct torque and flux controller (DTFC). It utilizes two PI controllers to predict the most appropriate voltage vector adaptive to error amplitudes are predicted and synthesized. This results in reduced torque and flux ripples with a constant switching frequency. Several stator flux and speed estimators are proposed to achieve sensorless control. The simple open-loop estimator works well only in the medium to high speed region. This is because the other problems of the DTC such as non-linearities of the inverter, stator resistance variation and dc-offset effects are not addressed. Improved flux and speed estimation is achieved by employing closed-loop observers. A speed adaptive sliding mode observer for joint stator flux and rotor speed estimation is firstly proposed. To further improve the very low speed performance of the DTFC, another inherently speed sensorless sliding mode observer based on a novel concept called the extended rotor flux is proposed. This observer delivers satisfactory performance in the very low speed region. Nevertheless, continuous full-load operation at standstill is not possible. For persistent zero speed operation with full-load, a high frequency signal injection technique is proposed in this thesis. A carrier excitation signal was injected into the machine and the stator current response was used to extract the rotor position information. As the signal injection scheme becomes less effective at higher speeds, a hybrid signal injection and sliding mode observer is introduced to enable sensorless operation over a wide speed range. The abovementioned {{studies show that the}} problems of the DTC for IPM machines have now been significantly reduced compared to what have been achieved to date; making it a viable and cost-effective candidate for future wide <b>speed</b> sensorless <b>IPM</b> synchronous motor drives...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{response}} of several nickel aluminide alloys to SigmaJig testing was done to examine their weld solidification cracking behavior {{and the effect of}} Zr concentration. The alloys were based on the Ni- 8 Al- 7. 7 Cr- 1. 5 Mo- 0. 003 B wt% composition and contained Zr concentrations of 3, 4. 5, and 6 wt%. Vacuum induction melted ingots with a diameter of 2. 7 in and weight about 18 lb were made of each alloy, and were used to make 2 x 2 x 0. 030 in specimens for the Sigmajig test. The gas tungsten arc welds were made at travel speeds of 10, 20, and 30 ipm with heat inputs of 2 [...] 2. 5 kJ/in. When an arc was established before traveling onto the test specimen centerline cracking was always observed. This problem was overcome by initiating the arc directly on the specimens. Using this approach, the 3 wt% Zr alloy withstood an applied stress of 24 ksi without cracking at a welding <b>speed</b> of 10 <b>ipm.</b> This alloy cracked at 4 ksi applied at 20 ipm, and with no applied load at 30 ipm. Only limited testing was done on the remaining alloys, but the results indicate that resistance to solidification cracking increases with Zr concentration. Zirconium has limited solid solubility and segregates strongly to interdendritic regions during solidification where it forms a Ni solid solution-Ni{sub 5 }Zr eutectic. The volume fraction of the eutectic increases with Zr concentration. The solidification cracking behavior of these alloys is consistent with phenomenological theory, and is discussed in this context. The results from SigmaJig testing are analyzed using finite element modeling of the development of mechanical strains during solidification of welds. Experimental data from the test substantially agree with recent analysis results...|$|R
