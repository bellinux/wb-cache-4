40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} basis upon which to preserve the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s current lawmaking primacy. Given the large body of preexisting literature on Chevron, USA, Inc v. Natural Resources Defense Council, it does not address whether Chevron allocates power between agencies and the courts optimally. Rather, the article examines how the PTO 2 ̆ 7 s <b>statutory</b> <b>interpretations</b> should be reviewed under Chevron. In Section I, the article places the examination in context by describing the Chevron decision and its general implications. Section II of the article examines how Chevron should be applied specifically {{in the context of}} reviewing <b>statutory</b> <b>interpretations</b> of the PTO. The article observes that the Federal Circuit has so far avoided deferring to the PTO by emphasizing Congress 2 ̆ 7 intent as a limitation on the PTO 2 ̆ 7 s lawmaking power. Under Chevron, however, Congress 2 ̆ 7 intent governs only where Congress has expressed itself clearly on the precise question at issue. The article argues that the PTO is outside the class of Federal agencies to whose <b>statutory</b> <b>interpretations</b> the judiciary owes deference. The PTO performs few of the traditional functions of Federal agencies. It is, in fact, structurally isolated from so much of the patent system that the assumptions of agency expertise responsible for Chevron are inapplicable. There is also evidence that Congress has affirmatively decided to give lawmaking power in the patent field to the courts and not the PTO. As a result, the article concludes, the courts need not defer to the PTO 2 ̆ 7 s <b>statutory</b> <b>interpretations</b> even in those situations where the statutory language is ambiguous...|$|R

5|$|Scalia {{served on}} the Court for nearly thirty years, during which time he espoused a {{conservative}} jurisprudence and ideology, advocating textualism in <b>statutory</b> <b>interpretation</b> and originalism in constitutional interpretation. He was a strong defender of {{the powers of the}} executive branch, believing presidential power should be paramount in many areas. He supported the death penalty and opposed abortion, affirmative action, same-sex marriage, as well as most policies that afforded equal or special status to minority groups, earning {{a reputation as one of}} the most conservative justices on the Court. He filed separate opinions in many cases, often castigating the Court's majority using scathing language.|$|E
5|$|Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 is a {{provision}} of the Human Rights Act 1998 that enables the Act to take effect in the United Kingdom. The section requires courts to interpret both primary and subordinate legislation so that their provisions are compatible with the articles of the European Convention of Human Rights, which {{are also part of}} the Human Rights Act 1998. This interpretation goes far beyond normal <b>statutory</b> <b>interpretation,</b> and includes past and future legislation, therefore preventing the Human Rights act from being impliedly repealed by subsequent contradictory legislation.|$|E
5|$|As simple {{ultra vires}} {{concerns}} the exact powers conferred upon government ministers and statutory bodies, <b>statutory</b> <b>interpretation</b> {{is arguably the}} most important exercise the courts need to engage in to determine the scope of powers laid out in the statute. Hence, the cases decided are fact-specific and depend upon each court's interpretation of the relevant statute, making success of the judicial review somewhat unpredictable. The UK case of Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation (1921), illustrates this concept. The defendant was a statutory body establishing washhouses and baths for residents who could not afford their own washing facilities. When it subsequently established a laundry service, the defendant was declared to have acted ultra vires since its statutory purpose was not to carry on a business. Even though the business was carried out at a substantial loss, the statute in question did not give the defendant such a power to do so. Accordingly, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed.|$|E
40|$|My {{objective}} in this Article {{is to demonstrate}} that the PTO 2 ̆ 7 s patentability determinations are questions of policy and, therefore, the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s standards of review, as applied to these determinations, are unsound. With respect to the Commissioner 2 ̆ 7 s <b>statutory</b> <b>interpretations,</b> I intend {{to demonstrate that the}} court 2 ̆ 7 s “traditional factors of statutory construction,” which are used {{in such a way as}} to avoid deferring to the PTO, result in irrational decisions, or at the very least, an alternative theory of interpretation no more convincing than that put forth by the PTO. My principle assertion, grounded in both doctrine and policy, is that the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s judicial review of the BPAI 2 ̆ 7 s patentability determinations and the Commissioner 2 ̆ 7 s <b>statutory</b> <b>interpretations</b> is paternalistic and results in a less than optimal balance of interpretive power. What I ultimately advocate, therefore, is a “paradigm shift” with respect to the way deference is viewed by the Federal Circuit...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{function of the}} modern judiciary {{is to ensure that}} decisions by administrative agencies remain within statutory boundaries. These boundaries, however, are often imprecise. Rather than specify the precise details of a program, Congress often gives an agency a broad mandate, for example, to clean up the environment, to monitor the banking system, or to improve worker safety. In such circumstances, federal courts sometimes defer to <b>statutory</b> <b>interpretations</b> made by the implementing agencies...|$|R

5|$|The {{decision}} in Pepper {{has been linked}} to a positive move in <b>statutory</b> <b>interpretation</b> that had been proceeding {{since the end of the}} Second World War. Previously, the dominant approach was that of the literal rule, supplemented by the golden and mischief rules (that interpretations should not be made if they were to lead to absurdity, and that interpretations should take into account the intention behind the statute). These approaches all limited the amount of material which could be used by a judge when interpreting the actions of Parliament. Following the 1969 Law Commission report The Interpretation of Statutes, British courts began to use a more purposive approach, which directed that when interpreting a statute they should examine the purpose behind it, rather than simply using the text of the statute itself. In effect, this widened the amount of material judges could use, including not only the statute but reports made by government bodies, the Law Commission and Royal Commissions. The impact of Pepper was to include Hansard in this list of acceptable material, not only to establish the overall purpose of an act but to define what was meant by a particular provision.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{presents}} {{findings from}} the most comprehensive empirical study to date on how the federal courts of appeals have applied Chevron deference - the doctrine under which courts defer to a federal agency’s reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute that it administers. Based on 1561 agency interpretations the circuit courts reviewed from 2003 to 2013, {{we found that the}} circuit courts overall upheld 71 % of interpretations and applied Chevron deference 75 % of the time. But there was nearly a twenty-five percentage-point difference in agency-win rates when the circuit courts applied Chevron deference than when they did not. Among many other things, our study reveals important differences across circuits, agencies, agency formats, and subject matters as to judicial review of agency <b>statutory</b> <b>interpretations</b> - as our rankings based on these variables illustrate. Based on prior empirical studies of judicial deference at the Supreme Court, however, our findings suggest {{that there may be a}} Chevron Supreme and a Chevron Regular: Whereas Chevron may not have much of an effect on agency outcomes at the Supreme Court, Chevron deference seems to matter in the circuit courts. That there is a Chevron Supreme and a Chevron Regular may suggest that, in Chevron, the Supreme Court has an effective tool to supervise lower courts’ review of agency <b>statutory</b> <b>interpretations...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Violation of the {{copyright}} holder’s exclusive rights can trigger civil, or possibly criminal, penalties. <b>Statutory</b> <b>interpretations</b> of criminal liability provisions {{have historically been}} more narrowly construed than those assigning civil penalties.

For example, the federal circuit courts were divided over whether an agency that lacked the power to adopt legislative rules could claim Chevron deference for its <b>statutory</b> <b>interpretations.</b> 5 Other questions focused on the formats agencies used to communicate their interpretations. Regulations adopted through notice-and-comment rulemaking seemed obviously Chevron-eligible, as Chevron itself concerned such a rule. 6 Courts were less clear, however, about the eligibility for Chevron review of agency adjudications or rules that lacked notice and comment procedures, like proposed rules, interpretative rules, or interim rules. ...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{presents}} a positive theoretical {{analysis of the}} relationship between the textual plausibility and procedural formality of agency <b>statutory</b> <b>interpretations.</b> The Article’s central claim is that textual plausibility and procedural formality function as strategic substitutes: Increasing either the textual plausibility or the procedural formality of an agency’s interpretive decision increases the agency’s chances of surviving judicial scrutiny, but both of these options impose costs on the agency, and so the agency will rationally choose the optimal mix of textual plausibility and procedural formality in order to secure the greatest policy advantages at the least cost. Changes that increase or decrease the costs or benefits associated with one of these two variables (plausibility and formality) will not only have a direct effect on that variable, but, because of the agency’s rational optimization, will also have an indirect effect on the other variable as well. The analysis generates a variety of predictions regarding the behavioral effects of various administrative law doctrines. While several of these predictions are straightforward, others are less intuitive and more novel. These results suggest that several important and longstanding debates in administrative law are incomplete without fuller consideration of the strategic substitution effect...|$|R
