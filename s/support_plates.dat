50|$|The Trofimoff valve {{comprises}} the valve spindle, the piston valve heads slotted onto {{them and the}} two supporting plates (Stützplatten). When the engine is running under load the valve heads are forced by steam pressure onto the <b>support</b> <b>plates</b> and work like standard pistons (Regelkolbenschieber). If steam admission ceases or, on a steam locomotive, the regulator is closed, the pressure drops, the valve heads remain in the inside dead centre position near {{the centre of the}} cylinder due to the tension of the piston rings. The valve spindle continues to move backwards and forwards with the <b>support</b> <b>plates</b> attached to it, without disturbing the valve heads. In this way, perfect pressure balance is achieved, thus ensuring excellent light-running conditions for the steam engine or locomotive.|$|E

50|$|At {{least in}} 1958, the {{computer}} was the Mk. 47, an hybrid electronic/electromechanical system.

However, it still had disc/roller integrators as well as shafting to interconnect the mechanical elements.

(The sections, when pulled out, moved fore and aft; they were heavy, not counterbalanced. Typically, a ship rolls through a much larger angle than it pitches.) The Mk. 47 probably had 3-D cams for ballistics, but information on it appears very difficult to obtain.|$|E

40|$|A {{data bank}} of field {{experiences}} with heat exchanger tube vibration reveals numerous cases of tube failures at, or near, the baffle. The {{objective of this}} study is to provide qualitative impact/fretting wear information for heat exchanger tubes through the performance of a series of tests involving the pertinent parameters: impact force level, between the tube and its support; tube to <b>support</b> <b>plate</b> hole clearance; tube <b>support</b> <b>plate</b> thickness; and tube vibration frequency. The characteristics of impact/fretting wear relative to tube motion pattern, material combination and surrounding fluid were also investigated. The test apparatus consists of a cantilevered tube with a simulated tube <b>support</b> <b>plate</b> at the ''free end''. Tube vibration is induced by an electromagnetic exciter to simulate the flow-induced tube motion occurring in a real heat exchanger at the tube/tube <b>support</b> <b>plate</b> interface. Tests are conducted in air, water, and oil, all at room temperature. Wear rate increases significantly with the magnitude of the impact force between the tube and its support plate; the degree and trend of the wear rates are highly dependent on the mechanical and metallurgical properties of the tube/support material combination; the rate of impact/fretting wear decreases with increasing frequency. An empirical formula is proposed to correlate the experimental impact/fretting wear results...|$|R
