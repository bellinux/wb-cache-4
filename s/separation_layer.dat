40|$|The IGB has {{developed}} ceramic hollow fiber and capillary membranes of &# 60; 1 mm dia and 100 - 200 /m wall thickness.

The -Al 2 O 3 hollow fiber carrier has pores of &# 62; 200 nm with narrow pore size distribution {{and can be used}} directly for microfiltration. For numerous other applications such as ultra-, nanofiltration and gas and vapor separation however additional membrane layers are used. The discussion covers various coating systems on a sol-gel basis such as spinel coatings and unmodified and modified Al 2 O 3 coatings and their application to ceramic hollow fiber carriers. The application potential and the limits of the membrane coatings are considered. Besides use in ultrafiltration the coatings are suitable as intermdiate <b>layers</b> for additional <b>separation</b> <b>layers</b> such as nanofiltration layers, hydrogen selective metal layers, and selective polymer <b>separation</b> <b>layers.</b> Introducing selective polyme r <b>separation</b> <b>layers</b> into gas and vapor separation is an example. Because of the absolute solvent resistance of the substructure here in contrast to coated polymer membranes there are no application limitations. There are no limitations in the choice of coating solvent medium. Thus even polymers the covering of which needs the use of aggressive solvents, but that otherwise exhibit a high chemical or thermal resistance, is brought onto the ceramic carrier. By use of such resistant polymers the application range of the membrane is strongly broadened...|$|R

30|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} interest in processes for thin silicon solar cells. One of these is the PSi process, which has been initially presented decades ago [2 – 4]. An essential part in this process is the etching of the porous silicon double layer, which consists of a starting and a <b>separation</b> <b>layer.</b> The <b>separation</b> <b>layer</b> is the place where the deposited epitaxial layer will be detached from the substrate. The detachability {{is a function of the}} homogeneity of the porous silicon in the <b>separation</b> <b>layer.</b> Therefore, the formation of the porous layers is one of the crucial steps in the PSi process. Homogeneous pore formation can be achieved only with constant etching parameters. This can be realized by keeping the composition of the etching bath constant, as variations in the chemical composition of the bath require a modification of the etching parameters. This adjustment is a time-consuming process and requires comprehensive knowledge of the behavior of the etching process itself. By keeping the chemical composition of the bath constant, no adjustment of the etching parameters is necessary, and thus, homogeneous pore formation can be achieved. However, the chemical composition can change due to etching reactions, evaporation, dilution, or a combination of these factors. Therefore, periodical analysis of the etching bath components is required.|$|E
