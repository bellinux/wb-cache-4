5000|$|Prior to the 2007 summer protests, {{there had}} been growing unease in the {{population}} regarding the economic distress of the country which has stagnant economic growth and is ranked among the 20 poorest {{countries in the world}} according to the United Nations. Many, including the United Nations have blamed the economic problems on the leadership of the military junta and the proportion of national income spent on the armed forces. In late 2006, the cost of basic commodities began rising sharply in Burma with rice, eggs, and cooking oil increasing by 30-40%. According to the UN, one in three children is chronically malnourished, government spending on health and education is among the lowest anywhere in the world, and the average income is below $300 a year. Living a privileged, parallel existence, Burma's military forces appear virtually a [...] "state within a state", free from the economic insecurity that afflicts the rest of the country.

50|$|The SLORC {{also stated}} that the {{services}} of the Deputy Ministers in the previous Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) government which it replaced were also terminated.
