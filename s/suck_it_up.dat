The group's president said she was told that those issues, along with anti-Trump and Black Lives Matter messaging and signage, were [...] "too political". As {{a result of the}} affiliate's criticism, a small group of women from Eastern Oregon who served as the original organizers of the Portland event were replaced with new leaders to [...] " [...] a larger platform to women of color". After the NAACP chapter was made aware of the leadership changes, its president explained: [...] "I felt it was important that we not miss this teachable moment about what role of race and religion and class were playing in pulling this march together." [...] Furthermore, she told Willamette Week: [...] "Putting a black woman's face {{at the beginning of the}} march doesn't fundamentally change the reason we withdrew our support. It's always been the case that if somebody suffers a racist incident, you're just supposed to <b>suck</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and then, for the sake of unity, let's all join hands and pretend it didn't happen. I'm just at a place where I don't think that's healthy or wise anymore." ...|$|E

50|$|When {{those from}} Earth step on {{a way to}} get to Foo, they may not get there completely. They only {{partially}} arrive, since their bodies and souls stay on Earth.

50|$|Adults wander {{during the}} daytime {{in search of}} food since milkweeds live in patches that can vary in size and {{distance}} apart from one another. When a seed is found, they inject saliva into it through a long rostrum, this pre-digests the seed and allows O. fasciatus to <b>suck</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> through their anterior pump and pharynx. Often there are multiple adults feeding on one seed, suggesting there is a signal released by feeding individuals that indicate a good food source. It has been shown that adults are more likely to find a food source when there is already another adult feeding on it, further supporting the signaling concept. Occasionally, females are seen feeding on shedding exoskeletons from moulting individuals. Rarely, cannibalization is observed in laboratory settings.|$|E

60|$|After {{treating}} it thus {{for a short}} time, he stroked down its neck, and then its shoulders--the horse eyeing {{him all the time}} nervously. Gradually he stroked its back and limbs gently, and walked quietly round and round it once or twice, sometimes approaching and sometimes going away, but never either hesitating or doing anything abruptly. This done, he went down to the stream and filled his cap with water and carried it to the horse, which snuffed suspiciously and backed a little, so he laid the cap down, and went up and patted him again. Presently he took up the cap and carried it to his nose; the poor creature was almost choking with thirst, so that, the moment he understood what was in the cap, he buried his lips in <b>it</b> and <b>sucked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
50|$|As stated above, a pipefish's diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} newborn fish and small crustaceans. As the pipefish does not chew its food, the prey {{needs to be}} {{small enough to fit}} in the mouth and be swallowed whole. The long pipe-like mouth of the pipefish is used as a <b>sucking</b> tool when <b>it</b> eats. The pipefish wraps its tail around sea grass, using it as an anchor. It patiently waits until its prey swims close, and then <b>sucks</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> puffing out its cheeks in the process. The tube is dilated which creates a small, strong current in the water near the fish's mouth. According to Guenther Sterba, author of Freshwater Fishes of the World, the current is accompanied by a sucking noise, much like a small vacuum cleaner. Many species of large fish prey on pipefish, as do otters and blue crabs. This particular species of pipefish has no real defense against predators aside from camouflage and swimming away, making it an easy target.|$|R
50|$|A sturgeon's {{taste buds}} {{are located on}} the outside of its mouth. This, along with the barbels, allows it to see if a {{possible}} food source is edible before <b>sucking</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> into its mouth. As adults, the white sturgeon's diet somewhat varies. This is dependent upon the river systems where it lives. In the Columbia River system, dead fish, crustaceans, and mollusks are all popular prey. Lampreys, primitive eel-like fish, come into rivers to spawn {{at the same time as}} the white sturgeon, and are a popular food source then. Smelt is another abundant food around spawning time. Shad come into the Columbia River system in throngs of several million each spring. The extremely large shad runs are often cited as an example of why the lower Columbia River has such a large population of sturgeon. Like the smelt, these fish often die, and the remains are an easy meal for sturgeon.|$|R
