5|$|Whelp {{was sold}} to the South African Navy (SAN) in 1952 and renamed Simon van der Stel.

Steph becomes friends with Niall, who fell for her, although she saw him more as someone to confide her problems in. Max began to see Steph as selfish and only interested in her career and money, which led to several arguments between the pair. One day, he caught her alone with Niall, wearing only a shirt. She'd spilled something on her dress, but he assumed the worst and they broke up. A few days later <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to Niall's place and they kissed, but were interrupted by his room-mate.|$|E

25|$|In early 1929, Abbott visited New York City, {{ostensibly to}} find an American {{publisher}} for Atget's photographs. Upon seeing the city again, however, Abbott immediately saw its photographic potential. Accordingly, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to Paris, closed up her studio, and returned to New York in September.

Her work has provided a historical chronicle of many now-destroyed buildings and neighborhoods of Manhattan.|$|E

25|$|Rabbinic {{literature}} also records {{a tradition}} of eating cheese and other dairy products during Hanukkah. This custom, as mentioned above, commemorates the heroism of Judith during the Babylonian captivity of the Jews and reminds us that women also {{played an important role}} in the events of Hanukkah. The deuterocanonical book of Judith (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the Tanakh, records that Holofernes, an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews was cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the beheading of Holofernes by Judith has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.|$|E
