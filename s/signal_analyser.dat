40|$|All {{electrical}} signals can {{be described}} either {{as a function of}} time or of frequency. When we observe signals as a function of time they are called the time domain measurements. Sometimes, we observe the frequencies present in signals, in which case they are called the frequency domain measurements. The word spectrum refers to the frequency content of any signal. When signals are periodic, time and frequency are simply related; namely, one is the inverse of the other. Then we can use the Fourier series to find the spectrum of the signal. For non-periodic signals, a Fourier transform is used to get the spectrum. This chapter provides an overview of fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques, as applied to dynamic <b>signal</b> <b>analysers</b> (or FFT analysers) or DSOs where spectrum components of a time varying signal are to be displayed.

For late-season sweet orange varieties which simultaneously bear mature fruit, immature fruitlets and flowers shaker harvesting decreases the subsequent year’s yield. This study, investigated the frequency response of mature fruits and immature fruitlets to determine the optimum frequency range for an efficient and selective harvest. Laboratory vibration transmission tests were conducted with 14 branches bearing 76 mature fruits and 151 immature ‘Valencia’ fruitlets. The fruit and branch response to the forced vibration was measured by several sets of five triaxial accelerometers with a dynamic <b>signal</b> <b>analyser.</b> Three frequency ranges with the highest vibration transmission values were identified for mechanical harvesting lower than 10 Hz.

In this frequency range, 53. 4 % of mature fruit amplified the acceleration a mean value of 2. 2 times, while only 7. 3 % of immature fruitlets amplified the acceleration with a mean value of 4. 4 times.

This might be shown experimentally in progressively desiccated toads, which would mimic the conditions prevailing in their natural habitat. The possibility was examined with animals housed in a thermostatic cupboard at 24 =n- 8 =deg containers lined in the bottom with a layer of drying mud. After 7 days, to simulate a heavy shower, some toads were abruptly thrown into tap water.

The process also involved the {{integration of}} a two-stage 4 He- 3 He adsorption refrigerator with the PTC to produce a cryogen free sub-Kelvin system. Thermometry electronics with an onboard computer and an internet interface have been developed that allow for remote and/or automatic operation. Methods to reduce excess noise seen in the 300 mK bolometer have been investigated to demonstrate {{the possibility of using}} high sensitivity bolometric detectors in this system for astrophysics and Earth observation instruments. In order to minimise the microphonic induced noise and thermal fluctuations from the pulse tube operation an AC biasing circuit was used. The origin of excess noise components in the bolometer readout have been identified and quantified as a function of both mechanical and electrical configurations of the cold components. With the optimum configuration thermal fluctuation noise, rather than microphonic induced noise dominates, reducing the bolometer sensitivity by approximately two times compared to the same device operated in a liquid helium cooled cryostat. Clearly the performance could be improved by increasing the thermal isolation of the sorption refrigerator from the pulse tube temperature oscillations. The hot-electron bolometer behaved nominally up to 6 kHz when operated in the cryogen free cryostat. Dynamic audio frequency noise deteriorated the detector's performance above 6 kHz and has been attributed to the movement of the helium gas through the PTC's valves and orifices during its thermodynamic cycle.

40|$|Newly {{developed}} {{communication systems}} put strict requirements {{on the performance}} of RF power amplifiers. A key issue for the development of RF PA is the inherent nonlinearity of power amplifiers hindering its integration with the well established small-signal development infrastructure which forms a closely interlinked chain of measurement systems, small-signal models and CAD based simulation and design software. The linkage between these components is provided by common small-signal data import and export file formats ensuring a bidirectional data exchange without any loss of the small-signal information. However, no equivalent infrastructure exists for a large-signal design process inhibiting the development of RF power amplifiers and other nonlinear components. This work demonstrates a coherent methodology aiming to provide equivalent infrastructure for large signal design process as already exists in small signal design process. As first part of the methodology, a new approach is proposed to directly import measured current and voltage waveforms, obtained from a typical Large <b>Signal</b> Network <b>Analyser</b> (LSNA) system recently developed in Cardiff University, into nonlinear CAD simulator for power amplifier design. This approach offers an efficient solution for using large signal characteristic data in CAD-based simulation and PA design as the simulation/design accuracy is guaranteed by measurement and the no lengthy data processing is required. The approach is implemented in Agilent ADS simulator and its validity is comprehensively verified on different devices and device technologies. Moreover, the potential of it in predicting device large signal performance when interpolation or extrapolation is needed is explored. As second part of the methodology, a new large signal nonlinear behavioural approach is proposed from behavioural modelling perspective as a complementation to the direct waveform utilization approach. The proposed modelling approach features in impressive simulation speed while maintaining excellent simulation accuracy. The modelling approach is developed on the basis of polynomial approximation and theoretical analysis shows that the approach can be considered as reasonable extension of S parameter design tool in large signal environment. It's demonstrated in this work that the model is extracted from large signal waveform data with specially designed parameter extraction procedure. The extracted model is verified on several devices and repeatable accuracy can be obtained even on high power devices such as 100 w LDMOS. It's illustrated in this work that the above two distinctive approaches can be combined and nicely considered as parts of an integrated nonlinear measurement data utilization strategy. Such a strategy provides a fast and time efficient path to accurate CAD-based nonlinear design even at power levels relevant for base station applications...|$|R

The former method was carried out by impact hammer and an FFT digital <b>signal</b> <b>analyser</b> and the latter method was undertaken using finite element computer software. The current research concentrated upon the procedures and possible techniques available to optimise the dynamic properties of the plate without introducing weight penalty with the object of achieving an efficient structural performance coupled with an economic design. It has been shown that most of the increase in frequency and critical buckling load was directly related to the increase in stiffness of the stiffener and its position on the plate structure. The mode shapes have provided information regarding the most advantageous position for the setting of the stiffeners; they must be positioned away from nodal lines. The effect of the stiffener was significant for the fully clamped and clamped/free plates where only bending modes of vibration are present. However, for the completely free plates, where both bending and torsional modes of vibration could occur, the effect that the stiffeners have on the torsional modes was minimal. To locate precisely the position of the stiffener may be difficult when the plates are subjected to in-plane compressive loads, because higher order mode shapes may interchange. The mass-saving advantage which has been obtained in this research has shown that the stiffened plates with top-hat stiffeners were seen to have higher natural frequencies, within a specific vibration mode, compared to stiffened plates with rectangular stiffeners (blade) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasingly}} high {{demands for}} {{high data rate}} wireless communication services require spectrum- and energy-efficient solutions. In this thesis, a number of energy-efficient semi-blind receiver structures are proposed to perform Doppler spread estimation, channel estimation and equalisation for broadband wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. A real-time wireless communication testbed is developed to verify the proposed semi-blind receiver structures. In the first contribution, a semi-blind Doppler spread estimation and Kalman filtering based channel estimation approach is proposed for wireless OFDM systems. A short sequence of reference data is carefully designed and applied as pilot symbols for Doppler spread estimation and channel estimation initialisation of the Kalman filter. Then the estimates of inter-carrier interference (ICI) caused by Doppler spread are gathered into the equivalent channel model and compensated for through channel equalisation, which dramatically reduces the computational complexity. The simulation {{results show that the}} proposed approach outperforms the conventional pilot aided Doppler spread and channel estimation schemes. In the second contribution, a semi-blind Doppler spread estimation and independent component analysis (ICA) based equalisation scheme aided by non-redundant precoding is proposed for wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OFDM systems. A number of reference data sequences are selected from a pool of orthogonal sequences for two purposes. First, the reference data sequences are superimposed in the source data sequences through non-redundant linear precoding to enable the Doppler spread estimation by minimising the sum cross-correlation between the compensated signals {{and the rest of the}} orthogonal sequences in the pool. Second, the same reference data sequences are applied to eliminate the phase and permutation ambiguity in the ICA equalised signals. Simulation results show that the proposed semi-blind MIMO OFDM system can achieve a bit error rate (BER) performance which is close to the ideal case with perfect channel state information (CSI). In the third contribution, a real-time wireless communication testbed is developed with a vector signal generator, a vector <b>signal</b> <b>analyser</b> and a pair of antennas, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed receiver structures over the air in different environments such as Reverberation chamber and office area. Measurement results show a good match with simulation results. Also, a pilot is employed for three purposes at a semi-blind receiver: time synchronisation, Doppler spread estimation and Kalman filtering initialisation, which is an extension of the work in the first contribution...|$|E
40|$|At its core, signal {{acquisition}} {{is concerned}} with efficient algorithms and protocols capable to capture and encode the signal information content. For over five decades, the indisputable theoretical benchmark has been represented by the wellknown Shannon’s sampling theorem, and the corresponding notion of information has been indissolubly related to signal spectral bandwidth. The contemporary society is founded on almost instantaneous exchange of information, which is mainly conveyed in a digital format. Accordingly, modern communication devices are expected to cope with huge amounts of data, in a typical sequence of steps which comprise acquisition, processing and storage. Despite the continual technological progress, the conventional acquisition protocol has come under mounting pressure and requires a computational effort {{not related to the}} actual signal information content. In recent years, a novel sensing paradigm, also known as Compressive Sensing, briefly CS, is quickly spreading among several branches of Information Theory. It relies on two main principles: signal sparsity and incoherent sampling, and employs them to acquire the signal directly in a condensed form. The sampling rate is related to signal information rate, rather than to signal spectral bandwidth. Given a sparse signal, its information content can be recovered even fromwhat could appear to be an incomplete set of measurements, at the expense of a greater computational effort at reconstruction stage. My Ph. D. thesis builds on the field of Compressive Sensing and illustrates how sparsity and incoherence properties can be exploited to design efficient sensing strategies, or to intimately understand the sources of uncertainty that affect measurements. The research activity has dealtwith both theoretical and practical issues, inferred frommeasurement application contexts, ranging fromradio frequency communications to synchrophasor estimation and neurological activity investigation. The thesis is organised in four chapters whose key contributions include: • definition of a general mathematical model for sparse signal acquisition systems, with particular focus on sparsity and incoherence implications; • characterization of the main algorithmic families for recovering sparse signals from reduced set of measurements, with particular focus on the impact of additive noise; • implementation and experimental validation of a CS-based algorithmfor providing accurate preliminary information and suitably preprocessed data for a vector <b>signal</b> <b>analyser</b> or a cognitive radio application; • design and characterization of a CS-based super-resolution technique for spectral analysis in the discrete Fourier transform(DFT) domain; • definition of an overcomplete dictionary which explicitly account for spectral leakage effect; • insight into the so-called off-the-grid estimation approach, by properly combining CS-based super-resolution and DFT coefficients polar interpolation; • exploration and analysis of sparsity implications in quasi-stationary operative conditions, emphasizing the importance of time-varying sparse signal models; • definition of an enhanced spectral content model for spectral analysis applications in dynamic conditions by means of Taylor-Fourier transform (TFT) approaches...|$|E
40|$|In cricket, {{high speed}} impacts occur between the cricket {{ball and the}} bat, player and their {{protective}} equipment. Improved understanding of impact dynamics {{has the potential to}} significantly improve the development of cricket equipment and also contribute to improving the player’s safety and performance. In particular, development of high performance cricket balls with enhanced structural properties (e. g. improved durability) would benefit greatly from such insight. In order to gain more insight into the impact dynamics of cricket balls, appropriate structural models of the ball are required. This work presents two fast-solving numerical models, a detailed multi-layer FE model as well as a universal FE model, for the structural analysis of cricket balls. The models were derived using experimental data obtained from tests developed for this purpose, including drop tests and high speed impact tests. The experimental work presented in this study included measurements of the impact behaviour of two-layer, three-layer, and five-layer cricket balls using a dynamic <b>signal</b> <b>analyser</b> and high speed video analysis software. The ball properties obtained experimentally were used to develop two mathematical models: a single-element model and a three-element model. These cricket ball models have been developed so that they capture the key characteristics of ball-impact behaviour while allowing for fast-solving dynamic simulation. The stiffness and damping properties of both models were determined using a novel fast-solving genetic algorithm. These models predict the force-time diagram during impact with very little computing cost. However, developing a mathematical model with a reasonable level of accuracy is still a challenge. The simulation of the ball model impact with a flat surface achieved reasonable agreement with experimental results for both the single-element and the three-element models. The genetic algorithm (GA) method proved to be more efficient and convenient than directly solving the differential equations. A detailed multi-layer, multi-material Finite Element (FE) model has also been developed. The model has been experimentally validated and refined to a greater level of detail than has been previously possible. Dynamic explicit analysis was conducted using ABAQUS (ABAQUS Inc., USA). A universal Finite Element (FE) ball model has also been developed within the ABAQUS CAE environment. This model {{can be seen as a}} combination of an FE model template and a material parameter selection tool based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. This approach allows for rapid model development while producing accurate results at different impact speeds. Two sets of real test data obtained from a five-layer cricket ball and a two-layer cricket ball at impact velocity of 25 m/s were used to examine the ANN model. The developed FE-ANN model and the corresponding training process represent an invaluable tool for facilitating design, analysis and structural optimization of cricket-related sport equipment. Furthermore, the application presented here can be extended to simulate any solid ball impact...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{confirmed}} that the 'ultrasonic scattering layers' give significant effects not only upon the biological workings {{in the formation of}} fishing ground but upon the planning, researching and using of the various underwater acoustic instruments - those which are concerned with navigation, fisheries and investigations; including oceanic life, oceanophysics, submarine resources, and so on. Owing the fact that the researches of the ultrasonic scattering layers have been performed by the oceanographically advanced countries, a great number of information have been obtained, concerning both biological and physiological issues. However, about such important issues as ① the relationship between the ultrasonic scattering layers and the fisheries, ② composition organisms in the layers, ③ ultrasonic scattering characteristics, and so on, no accurate information have been obtained, yet. Accordingly, with the intention of clarifying the oceanic state as it is, the author carried out some investigations on the Kagoshima bay where no existence of the ultrasonic scattering layers having diurnal vertical migration had been confirmed, yet. Firstly, some information about the ultrasonic scattering layers were obtained by means of the 50 kHz fish finder - in other words, a number of records were fixed continuously, day and night, on board the Training ship Nansei maru belonging to the Faculty of Fisheries, Kagoshima University, at both the innermost, and the middle, areas of the Kagoshima bay, in the respective seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter. Both vertical and horizontal towings were carried out by the closing plankton net and the Isaacs-Kidd midwater trawl net for the purpose of ascertaining the composition organisms of each layer. On the other hand, for the elucidation of the ultrasonic scattering characteristics, the scattering strengths of the respective layers were measured, and, in order to ascertain the physical features in the ocean, the vertical distributions of the water temperature from the sea surface to the sea bottom were observed by DBT (digital bathythermo graph); with the performed confirmation of the submarine illumination by an under water illuminometer. The number of the ultrasonic layers having diurnal vertical migration was fixed to be 'three', being unvaried through the whole year, both at the innermost and the middle, areas of the Kagoshima bay. Occasionally, only 'two' layers were recorded during the period from autumn to winter. Although more or less complicated phases were noted in the vertical migrations of the respective layers, in the outlined patterns, a close resemblance was noted. It was ascertained that there was a close relationship between the cause of the vertical migration, the depth where the respective layers were situated, and the degree of the submarine illumination. The optimum submarine illumination was fixed as in the following : the 1 st layer, 10 ^[- 7] lux ~ 10 ^[- 9] lux; the 2 nd layer, 10 ^[- 4] lux ~ 10 ^[- 7] lux, and in case of the 3 rd layer, 10 ^[0] lux ~ 10 ^[- 2] lux. No direct relationship was noted between the vertical distribution of water temperatures and the cause of vertical migration; however, the depth of the ultrasonic scattering layer showing no vertical migration agreed quite well with the depth of thermocline. The mean value of the maximum velosity of the vertical migration at each layer was as follows : the 1 st layer 2. 5 m/min., the 2 nd layer 2. 0 m/min., and the 3 rd layer 0. 8 m/min. respectively. The mean value of the scattering strength of each layer was as follows : the 1 st layer, - 39. 1 dB, the 2 nd layer, - 34. 7 dB and the 3 rd layer, - 36. 0 dB. The composition organisms of each layer were as follows : the 1 st layer, Pollichthys maulli, Maurolicus japonicus, Lophogaster japonicus; the 2 nd layer, Bemthosema pterotu, and the 3 rd layer, Pilchard. Secondly, considerations were made on a measuring theory applicable for the estimation of organism abundance in the ultrasonic scattering layers. With the use of frequency 50 kHz, at the indoor 50 tons water tank of the Kagoshima prefectural cultural fishery center, were carried out 2 sorts of experimental workings : － the measuring of the target strength of one individual in the four kinds of organisms composing the ultrasonic scattering layers, and the workings to examine the influence of the secondary radiation on the scattering strength. The target-movements were processed by a personal computer, with the employment of the general purpose <b>signal</b> <b>analyser</b> in processing the acoustic signal. Through the considerations of the measurement theory, a formula 8 - 34 described in the thesis and the approximate expression 8 - 63 indicated in the following : 10 log n = SV - 10 log (Tse + n・Tsm^[2]) were obtained. The target strengths of the individual organisms composing the ultrasonic scattering layers were as follows, respectively : Bemthosema pterotu, - 48. 4 dB, Pollichthys maulli, - 49. 3 dB, Maurolicus japonicus, - 50. 0 dB, and Lophogaster japonicus, - 52. 9 dB. In the target strength pattern, there was a strong similarity between the above mentioned fishes and the crustacea in the roll plane, but in the pitch plane, there was a large difference between these two. Lastly, the distribution of the organism abundance composing the ultrasonic scattering layers in the Kagoshima bay was estimated by making use of the following three issues, ascertained : namely, ① the target strength of the individual organisms obtained by the measurements in water tank, ② the scattering strength of each ultrasonic scattering layer obtained by the measurements on board the Nansei maru, and ③ the results of the organism collections obtained by towing the Isaacs-Kidd midwater trawl net. The approximate 'organisum abundance' composing the ultrasonic scattering layers (1 st layer, 2 nd layer) was estimated in all the areas of the Kagoshima bay (excluding entrance area), the results obtained was as it follows : Bemthosema pterotu 115, 000 tons, Pollichthys maulli 6, 000 tons, Maurolicus japonicus 5, 000 tons, and Lophogaster japonicus 13, 000 tons, with the confirmed result showing 140, 000 tons total amount. While the total fish catches by fishermen in all the areas of the Kagoshima bay were noted to be about 3, 450 tons. Hence the assumption that, {{due to the fact that}} the total abundance of the organisms composing ultrasonic scattering layers was big enough, compared with the total fish catches, the ever lasting importance of the ultrasonic scattering layers in the Kagoshima bay was reasonably confirmed...|$|E
