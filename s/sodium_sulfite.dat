2500|$|In industry, TNT is {{produced}} in a three-step process. First, toluene is nitrated {{with a mixture of}} sulfuric and nitric acid to produce mononitrotoluene (MNT). The MNT is separated and then renitrated to dinitrotoluene (DNT). In the final step, the DNT is nitrated to trinitrotoluene (TNT) using an anhydrous mixture of nitric acid and oleum. Nitric acid is consumed by the manufacturing process, but the diluted sulfuric acid can be reconcentrated and reused. [...] After nitration, TNT is stabilized by a process called sulfitation, where the crude TNT is treated with aqueous <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfite</b> solution to remove less stable isomers of TNT and other undesired reaction products. [...] The rinse water from sulphitation is known as red water and is a significant pollutant and waste product of TNT manufacture.|$|E

50|$|To avoid {{contamination}} and suppress {{the formation of}} by-products (which are difficult to remove) the reaction must be performed under careful control of mass ratios and process conditions. Excess sulfite (SO32−) or bisulfite (HSO3−) lead to an unpleasant odor of the downstream product, higher levels of ethylene glycol or glycol ethers (formed by the hydrolysis and ethoxylation of ethylene oxide) give hygroscopic and greasy surfactants. Concentrated ethylene glycol-containing sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate solutions can subsequently mostly be freed from ethylene glycol by continuous extraction with e.g. isopropanol (<0.5%). Therefore, in the continuous industrial process an aqueous <b>sodium</b> hydrogen <b>sulfite</b> solution is prepared in a first reactor by mixing a sodium hydroxide solution and sulfur dioxide. In a second reactor the <b>sodium</b> hydrogen <b>sulfite</b> solution is mixed with a slight excess of ethylene oxide to obtain sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate in almost quantitative yields at elevated temperature and pressure with a precise control of pH.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>sodium</b> {{hydrogen}} <b>sulfite</b> (S), used as antibrowning agent, on the phenolic profile of potato extracts was investigated. This extract {{was compared to}} one obtained {{in the presence of}} ascorbic acid (A). In the presence of A, two major compounds were obtained, 5 -O-caffeoylquinic acid (5 -CQA) and 4 -O-caffeoyl quinic acid. With S, their 2 '-sulfo-adducts were found instead, the structures of which were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Also, for minor caffeoyl derivatives and quercetin glycosides, the corresponding sulfo-adducts were observed. Feruloyl and sinapoyl derivatives were not chemically affected by the presence of S. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) was thought to be responsible for the formation of the sulfo-adducts. This was confirmed by preparing 2 '-sulfo- 5 -O-caffeoyl quinic acid in a model system using 5 -CQA, <b>sodium</b> hydrogen <b>sulfite,</b> and PPO. This sulfo-adduct exhibited a small bathochromic shift (¿max 329 nm) as compared to 5 -CQA (¿max 325 nm) and a strong hypochromic shift with an extinction coefficient of 9357 ± 395 M– 1 cm– 1 as compared to 18494 ± 196 M– 1 cm– 1, respectively.
