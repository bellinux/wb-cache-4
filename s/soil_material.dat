The depositional environment of the Touchet Formation, located in the Northwestern United States, had intervening periods of aridity {{which resulted in a}} series of rhythmite layers. Erosional cracks were later infilled with layers of <b>soil</b> <b>material,</b> especially from aeolian processes. The infilled sections formed vertical inclusions in the horizontally deposited layers of the Touchet Formation, and thus provided evidence of the events that intervened over time among the forty-one layers that were deposited.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which mycorrhizae increase absorption include some that are physical and some that are chemical. Physically, most mycorrhizal mycelia are much smaller in diameter than the smallest root or root hair, and thus can explore <b>soil</b> <b>material</b> that roots and root hairs cannot reach, and provide a larger surface area for absorption. Chemically, the cell membrane chemistry of fungi {{differs from that of}} plants. For example, they may secrete organic acid that dissolve or chelate many ions, or release them from minerals by ion exchange. Mycorrhizae are especially beneficial for the plant partner in nutrient-poor soils.|$|E

Solute transport experiments and measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity were used to characterize the solute transport properties of three Iowa <b>soil</b> <b>materials.</b> Experiments were carried out by using undisturbed soil samples as well as recompacted samples.

25|$|Depending on {{the initial}} void ratio, the <b>soil</b> <b>material</b> can respond to loading either {{strain-softening}} or strain-hardening. Strain-softened soils, e.g. loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or cyclically, if the static shear stress {{is greater than the}} ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil. In this case flow liquefaction occurs, where the soil deforms at a low constant residual shear stress. If the soil strain-hardens, e.g. moderately dense to dense sand, flow liquefaction will generally not occur. However, cyclic softening can occur due to cyclic undrained loading, e.g. earthquake loading. Deformation during cyclic loading will depend on the density of the soil, the magnitude and duration of the cyclic loading, and amount of shear stress reversal. If stress reversal occurs, the effective shear stress could reach zero, then cyclic liquefaction can take place. If stress reversal does not occur, zero effective stress is not possible to occur, then cyclic mobility takes place.|$|E

The three mulching treatments were: (1) No mulch, (2) Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) straw, and (3) Russian thistle (Salsola kali L.).

Significant differences were observed in number of stems per pot, plant height, and forage yield between <b>soil</b> <b>materials,</b> mulching treatments, and soil moisture treatments. The greatest number of stems per pot, the tallest plants, and the highest forage yield were produced in the Gila loam, barley straw mulch, and optimum soil moisture treatment. Use of a soil mulch (incorporated organic matter mulch) produced better plant growth and more forage than when soils were not mulched.

50|$|At {{perhaps the}} most {{fundamental}} level, distinction can be made between mineral soil horizons and organic soil horizons.

Typically, histosols have very low bulk density and are poorly drained because the organic matter holds water very well.

40|$|Acid sulfate {{soils are}} {{an issue of}} {{international}} concern. Globally they are estimated to affect 24 million ha. Little {{work has been done}} on metal behavior in acid sulfate soils especially in Australia. Metals potentially raise a number of issues in the use and remediation of acid sulfate soils, however current risk assessment and management of these soils deals with acidity production only. To adequately manage the metal contamination risk some understanding of metal mobility and availability is required. Total metal analyses give little indication of the potential mobility of the metals, and little understanding of how mobility can change under different remediation or management practices. Mobility is strongly linked to solid-phase associations and so sequential extractions are a useful tool to understand geochemical processes. By using a sequence of reagents, operationally defined fractions can be determined, that reflect the potential mobility and bioavailability of the metals stored in the soil. We examine 7 -step sequential extraction for metal association and mobility in acid sulfate <b>soil</b> <b>materials.</b> The notable feature of this proposed sequential extraction procedure is that it has been optimised for acid sulfate <b>soil</b> <b>materials.</b> In particular the method will quantify metals bound in the ‘sulfidic 2 ̆ 7 fraction: in many sequential extraction methods for soils and sediments, the sulfidic-associated metal fraction is not able to be determined separately.

In the present study, we describe and analyze folk knowledge related to the use of soils in non-industrial pottery making by peasant potters, in the municipality of Altinho, Pernambuco State, semiarid region at Brazil. Ethnoscientific techniques were used to record local knowledge, with an emphasis on describing the <b>soil</b> <b>materials</b> recognized by the potters, the properties they used to identify those <b>soil</b> <b>materials,</b> and the criteria employed by them to differentiate and relate such materials.
