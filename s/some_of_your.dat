25|$|Dewey {{believed}} that a woman’s place in society was determined by her environment and not just her biology. On women he says, “You think too much of women in terms of sex. Think of them as human individuals for a while, dropping out the sex qualification, and you won’t be so sure of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> generalizations about what they should and shouldn’t do”. John Dewey’s support helped to increase the support and popularity of Jane Addams’ Hull House and other settlement houses as well. With growing support, involvement of the community grew {{as well as the}} support for the women’s suffrage movement.|$|E

Before his letter arrived in Madras during {{the third week of}} February, Hardy contacted the Indian Office to plan for Ramanujan's trip to Cambridge. Secretary Arthur Davies of the Advisory Committee for Indian Students met with Ramanujan to discuss the overseas trip. In accordance with his Brahmin upbringing, Ramanujan refused to leave his country to [...] "go to a foreign land".

Well, I have some people in my constituency that actually robbed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> banks {{and they say the}} same thing."

[...] They do send him the money he requests, and– although it is not described directly in the novel– endure significant hardship for themselves as a result. His family, absent while he is in Paris, becomes even more distant despite this sacrifice. Although Goriot and Vautrin offer themselves as father figures to him, {{by the end of the}} novel they are gone and he is alone.|$|E
500|$|The {{standard}} of Rutherford's accommodation {{and his personal}} conduct attracted criticism from some Bible Students and Jehovah's Witnesses in the 1930s. Walter F. Salter, the Society's former branch manager in Canada, wrote a public letter to Rutherford in 1937, the month he was expelled from the group, claiming that Rutherford had exclusive use of [...] "luxurious" [...] and [...] "expensive" [...] residences (in Brooklyn, Staten Island, Germany, and San Diego), {{as well as two}} Cadillacs and alleged that {{on more than one occasion}} he had purchased for Rutherford cases of whiskey, brandy, beer and other liquors, and 'go from [...] "drink to drink"'. In July 1939 Olin R. Moyle, legal counsel for the Society, wrote an open letter of resignation to the president, in which he complained about behavior of some members of the Watch Tower Society, including Rutherford himself, that he considered excessive and inappropriate. Moyle mentioned California when discussing [...] "the difference between the accommodations furnished to you, and your personal attendants, compared with those furnished to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> brethren." [...] Moyle also accused Rutherford of [...] "unkind treatment of the staff, outbursts of anger, discrimination and vulgar language" [...] and condemned his allowing the [...] "glorification of alcohol" [...] at Bethel. Penton notes that Moyle was a [...] "teetotaller" [...] and [...] "puritanical", but claims Rutherford's drinking habits were [...] "notorious" [...] and cites unnamed former Brooklyn Bethel workers who told of occasional difficulties in getting Rutherford to the podium to give public talks due to inebriation.|$|E
500|$|On November 19, 1951, Zhou {{called a}} conference in Shenyang to discuss {{improvements}} to China's logistical network, but these did little to directly resolve China's supply problems. Peng visited Beijing several times {{over the next several}} months to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities. By the winter of 1951–52, Peng became convinced that the war would be protracted, and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the foreseeable future. On February 24, 1952, the Central Military Commission, presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA's logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort. After the government representatives emphasized their inability to meet the demands of the war, Peng, in an angry outburst, shouted: [...] "You have this and that problem... You should go to the front and see with your own eyes what food and clothing the soldiers have! Not to speak of the casualties! For what are they giving their lives? We have no aircraft. We have only a few guns. Transports are not protected. More and more soldiers are dying of starvation. Can't you overcome <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> difficulties?" [...] The atmosphere became so tense that Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference. Zhou subsequently called a series of meetings, where it was agreed that the PVA would be divided into three groups, to be dispatched to Korea in shifts; to accelerate the training of Chinese pilots; to provide more anti-aircraft guns to the front lines; to purchase more military equipment and ammunition from the Soviet Union; to provide the army with more food and clothing; and, to transfer the responsibility of logistics to the central government. Peng also became a zealous supporter of the Three-anti Campaign due to his belief that corruption and waste were the main causes of the PVA's hardship.|$|E

2500|$|In 1965, he met {{the poet}} Youenn Gwernig who was a Breton American like him in New York, and they became friends. [...] Gwernig used to {{translate}} his Breton language poems in English {{in order to make}} Kerouac read and understand them : [...] "Meeting with Jack Kerouac in 1965, for instance, was a decisive turn. Since he could not speak Breton he asked me : 'Would you not write <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> poems in English? I'd really like to read them !...'

2500|$|Rutherford {{moved into}} Beth Sarim in early 1930 {{and served as}} {{caretaker}} of the property awaiting {{the resurrection of the}} [...] "princes". Newspapers of the time reported on Rutherford's lavish lifestyle, which included a 16-cylinder Fisher Fleetwood Cadillac coupe. The residence was cited by Olin R. Moyle, former legal counsel for Jehovah's Witnesses, in a letter to Rutherford in 1939, as one of the examples of [...] "the difference between the accommodations furnished to you, and your personal attendants, compared with those furnished to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> brethren". Walter F. Salter, former manager of the Canadian branch of the Watch Tower Society, also criticized Rutherford's use of Beth Sarim.

A lot of this music was written when things were really puritanical and women didn’t have any rights, and so there isn’t a lot of embracing of the feminine except with the Virgin Mary, if that makes any sense.
