Scully initially doubts Wilczek's involvement, but finds that his voice matches a <b>speaking</b> <b>clock</b> Drake received before his death; Lamana sets out to arrest him.

50|$|Although {{they would}} not be {{considered}} to be <b>speaking,</b> <b>clocks</b> have incorporated noisemakers such as clangs, chimes, gongs, melodies, and the sounds of cuckoos or roosters from almost the beginning of the mechanical clock. Soon after Thomas Edison's invention of the phonograph, the earliest attempts to make a clock that incorporated a voice were made. Around 1878, Frank Lambert invented a machine that used a voice recorded on a lead cylinder to call out the hours. Lambert used lead in place of Edison's soft tinfoil. In 1992, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized this as the oldest known sound recording that was playable (though that status now rests with a phonautogram of Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville, recorded in 1857). It is on display at the National Watch and Clock Museum in Columbia, Pennsylvania.|$|R
5000|$|As {{well as the}} <b>speaking</b> <b>clocks,</b> {{there was}} {{ancillary}} equipment to provide timing signals, 1 pulse per second, 8 pulses per minute and 8 pulses per hour. The Time and Frequency Standards Section in the PMG Research Laboratories at 59 Little Collins Street, Melbourne maintained the frequency checks {{to ensure that the}} system was [...] "on time". From a maintenance point of view, {{the most important part of}} the mechanical clocks was to ensure that they were well oiled to minimise wear on the cams and to replace blown bulbs in the optical pickups from the glass disk recordings. When Time & Frequency Standards moved from 59 Collins Street to Clayton, the control signals were duplicated and a second bank of Caesium Beam Primary standards installed so the cutover was transparent with no loss of service.|$|R

40|$|The present {{introduction}} summarises {{the debate}} on the epistemological value of testimony, with a special focus on the reductionism vs. antireductionism polemics, and situates Indian philosophers within it. One thus sees that some Indian philosophical schools (especially Vaiśeṣika and Buddhist epistemology) attempted to reduce testimony to another, more fundamental, instrument of knowledge, typically to inference, whereas others (especially Mīmāṃṣā and Nyāya) emphasised the independent nature of testimony. The study then moves to the problem of the criteria for a reliable speaker and discusses border-line cases, such as that of <b>speaking</b> instruments (computers, <b>clocks</b> and the like). Finally, it looks at some promising and open-ended topics evoked by the Indian-European dialogue on testimony...|$|R
40|$|In 1905 Einstein {{presented}} the Clock Paradox and in 1911 Paul Langevin expanded Einstein's result to human observers, the "Twin Paradox. " I will explain the crucial difference between Einstein and Langevin. Einstein did not present the so-called "Twin Paradox. " Later Einstein continued to <b>speak</b> about the <b>clock</b> paradox. Einstein {{might not have}} been interested in the question: what happens to the observers themselves. The reason for this could be the following; Einstein dealt with measurement procedures, clocks and measuring rods. Einstein's observers were measuring time with these clocks and measuring rods. Einstein {{might not have been}} interested in so-called biology of the observers, whether these observers were getting older, younger, or whether they have gone any other changes; these changes appeared {{to be out of the}} scope of his "Principle of relativity" or kinematics. The processes and changes occurring within observers seemed to be good for philosophical discussions. Later writers criticized Einstein's clock paradox. Einstein quickly replied with witty, smart and clever retorts...|$|R
6000|$|It {{happened}} one {{day that}} an atheist and a man were standing together on a doorstep; and the atheist said, [...] "It is raining." [...] To which the man replied, [...] "What is raining?": which question {{was the beginning of}} a violent quarrel and a lasting friendship. I will not touch upon any heads of the dispute, which doubtless included Jupiter Pluvius, the Neuter Gender, Pantheism, Noah's Ark, Mackintoshes, and the Passive Mood; but I will record the one point upon which the two persons emerged in some agreement. It was that there is such a thing as an atheistic literary style; that materialism may appear in the mere diction of a man, though he be <b>speaking</b> of <b>clocks</b> or cats or anything quite remote from theology. The mark of the atheistic style is that it instinctively chooses the word which suggests that things are dead things; that things have no souls. Thus they will not speak of waging war, which means willing it; they speak of the [...] "outbreak of war," [...] as if all the guns blew up without the men touching them. Thus those Socialists that are atheist will not call their international sympathy, sympathy; they will call it [...] "solidarity," [...] as if the poor men of France and Germany were physically stuck together like dates in a grocer's shop. The same Marxian Socialists are accused of cursing the Capitalists inordinately; but the truth is that they let the Capitalists off much too easily. For instead of saying that employers pay less wages, which might pin the employers to some moral responsibility, they insist on talking about the [...] "rise and fall" [...] of wages; as if a vast silver sea of sixpences and shillings was always going up and down automatically like the real sea at Margate. Thus they will not speak of reform, but of development; and they spoil their one honest and virile phrase, [...] "the class war," [...] by talking of it as no one in his wits can talk of a war, predicting its finish and final result as one calculates the coming of Christmas Day or the taxes. Thus, lastly (as we shall see touching our special subject-matter here) the atheist style in letters always avoids talking of love or lust, which are things alive, and calls marriage or concubinage [...] "the relations of the sexes"; as if a man and a woman were two wooden objects standing in a certain angle and attitude to each other, like a table and a chair.|$|R
