5000|$|A coilover is an {{automobile}} suspension device. [...] "Coilover" [...] {{is short for}} [...] "coil spring over shock". It consists of a shock absorber with a coil spring encircling it. The shock absorber and spring are assembled as a unit prior to installation, and are replaced as a unit when the shock absorber has leaked. This provides damping without torsional loads. Some coilovers allow adjustment of ride height and preload, using a simple threaded <b>spring</b> <b>perch</b> similar to a nut. More advanced adjustable coilover systems use a threaded shock body, along with an adjustable lower mount for ride height adjustment, while an adjustment knob is used to adjust damping. Stiffness is changed by switching the spring for one with a different spring rate.|$|E
50|$|Some {{methods of}} lifting {{are good for}} the rear, {{but not for the}} front, such as lifting blocks. Lifting the rear with blocks is a common way to achieve the desired height. This is done by {{installing}} a block, of the desired height of lift, in between the leaf spring and leaf <b>spring</b> <b>perch</b> and installing longer U-bolts. It is a bad method for the front primarily because of safety issues while braking. When braking, the front wheels create the majority of the braking force. The block moves this lateral force, caused by braking, higher above the axle than it did in the stock form. This can cause the block to become displaced from its location and result in total loss of control.

The perches are spot welded to the chassis, and factory coated in a weatherproof mastic to stop their rusting, however in some rare occurrences, water gets behind the mastic causing the perches to rust and eventually to fail - leading to collapse of the suspension. The car remains controllable. This is a problem that Mercedes USA have acknowledged. The problem is not identifiable without first removing the mastic to check.|$|R
40|$|The {{torsional}} stiffness of a vehicle's chassis significantly affects its handling characteristics {{and is therefore}} an important parameter to measure. In this work a new twist fixture apparatus designed to measure the {{torsional stiffness}} of a Winston Cup series race car chassis is described.

The style was developed in the 19th century when a professor at Oxford University accidentally broke off the handle from a pair of lorgnette spectacles. He reputedly affixed two small nose-pads to the frame and found that he could use the tension in the folding <b>spring</b> to <b>perch</b> them on his nose. Whether or not this story is apocryphal is unknown. Oxfords are undoubtedly descended from the lorgnette, as early examples of them often had handles in addition to nose-pads. In style Oxfords are much like the C-bridge as the tension is provided by a flexible, sprung piece of metal; however, they also resemble the spring bridge, as the spring connects the two lenses and is distinct from the nose-pieces. Oxfords were popular up until the 1930s, and were manufactured as both frames and as 4 piece mounts for frameless, although the latter are hard to find.|$|R

40|$|Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) are a {{non-native}} {{species in}} most areas of British Columbia (BC) and could impact those ecosystems where they are introduced. To address this, I investigated seasonal diet composition and basic movement of introduced yellow perch in lakes within the Okanagan Region of British Columbia. In addition, a trial {{of the use of}} artificial spawning substrates as a potential method of removing eggs was completed. Diet composition was determined during five seasonal sampling periods, by counting and identifying items within perch stomachs. I compared diet composition among lakes, and among seasons and size classes within each lake using a multivariate analysis. Diet composition of yellow perch varied by lake. Most notably, yellow perch diets did not include juvenile fishes in several lakes, but the fish consumed large proportions of zooplankton. It is possible that diet composition of introduced yellow perch could be predicted based on presence or absence of predators and refugia for prey species. Prey selectivity and diet overlap with rainbow trout was also determined. Prey selectivity of perch varied among study lakes and seasons. Significant diet overlap between yellow perch and rainbow trout occurred in one of two lakes tested, likely lake-specific due to variable strains of rainbow trout stocked. Radio telemetry showed that in summer, yellow perch were found relatively close to shore, with no significant difference found among time periods within a 24 -hour tracking session. In <b>spring,</b> yellow <b>perch</b> were significantly farther from shore when ice was covering the lake, and moved closer to shore as the ice receded. This coincided with the beginning of the spawning season at temperatures of 3. 8 °C, the lowest end of the known spawning temperature range. Trials using artificial spawning substrates were successful. Perch spawned multiple times on all artificial spawning substrates and eggs were removed from the lake in an attempt to reduce spawning success.

Tritium activity levels in twenty-five monthly rainwater samples show a seasonal dependence with a maximum in the summer (18. 5 to 23 TU) and a minimum in the winter (12 TU). Samples from two surface-water reservoirs had activities of 13. 2 and 19. 7 TU reflecting contemporary rainwater which is their major source of recharge. Four streams in the Pearl Harbor area showed "rainwater" tritium levels when sampled at high flow. At low flow, two of the streams had low tritium levels indicating ground-water discharge into the stream, while the tritium activity of the other two streams was conparable to rainwater. Tritium activity higher than that of contemporary rainwater (22 - 38 TU) was exhibited by samples from two <b>springs</b> which discharge <b>perched</b> water, while samples from three wells and two shafts in the Honolulu area showed very little or no tritium activity.

Diffuse recharge (R D) by rainfall was quantified from daily soil water content field data to split R T into R D and the expected concentrated recharge (R C) at catchment scale in both hydrological years. R D was 0. 16 of rainfall in 2003 – 2004 and 0. 01 in 2004 – 2005. Under common 1 - to 3 -day rainfall events, the hydraulic effect of R D is delayed from 1 day to 1 week, while R C is not delayed.

40|$|A field {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to establish the}} present tritium and radiocarbon activity levels of natural waters found {{in various parts of}} the island of Oahu. The instrumentation required for the radiocarbon analysis was assembled and workable procedures were developed. Monthly rainwater samples obtained from rain gages on the Koolau Range contained seasonally fluctuating tritium concentrations which are well in excess of the natural abundance level. Excess concentrations were also found for the tritium and radiocarbon content of surface waters from three separate sources. These excess concentrations are the result of fallout from atmospheric nuclear explosions. Samples from nine tunnels, which tap various Koolau dike compartments, contained tritium activities ranging from the current rainwater levels down to the pre-nuclear explosion levels. Most samples showed radiocarbon activities comparable to pre-explosion atmospheric C 02 levels. Two samples, however, showed excess radiocarbon. Samples from wells and shafts tapping basal water in the Honolulu area generally showed little or no tritium and their radiocarbon concentrations were lower than those of the dike-water samples. Makiki, Booth, and Roseapple <b>Springs,</b> which discharge <b>perched</b> water, exhibited tritium levels slightly in excess of the contemporary rain water levels. Nuclear explosion radiocarbon was present at Makiki Spring whereas it was absent at Booth Spring. Correlations between radiocarbon and chloride content were found for samples from Central Oahu and the Pearl Harbor area. The magnitude of both constituents were moreover a function of the distance between the sample source and Pearl Harbor. Three multiple depth samples from well T- 133 at Ewa Beach showed very low radiocarbon content. These results can be evidences of radioactive decay of the radiocarbon thus indicating very long residence times of these waters. Exchange reactions between the water-carbonates and the radiocarbon-free aquifer carbonates can lead to the same results however. The discovery of a linear relationship between the radiocarbon activity and chloride contents of these samples indicates that chemical exchange reactions have taken place.

40|$|The {{foothill}} {{and mountain}} {{reaches of the}} Big Chico Creek watershed have experienced little impact from human activities. The watershed encompasses physical and hydrologic characteristics ideal for water resource studies. Big Chico Creek traverses deformed strata assumed to be the principal recharge zone for the Tuscan Aquifer system. These strata comprise formations of the Cascade Province and the much older Great Valley Sequence. Of primary interest are the Chico and Tuscan Formations of which the later is the principal host rock for Butte Basin ground water found in the valley reach of this watershed. The underlying Chico Formation is considered the base of fresh ground water in the Butte Basin. Big Chico Creek is a spring fed stream that travels 45 miles from Colby Mountain to its confluence with the Sacramento River. The stream is hydrologically connected to the strata it dissects exchanging water and nutrients its entire length: alternating as an effluent and influent stream contingent on the physical and hydraulic parameters of the rock it encounters; stream flow; and the elevation of the water table surrounding the stream. The creek often dries late in the water year, long before its confluence having lost its flow to valley sediments as ground water recharge. Over 30 springs have been mapped in the Big Chico Creek Ecological Reserve within the foothill region of this watershed. The study of spring water yields a small window into the exploration of interactions between ground water and rock without expensive, exploitive processes. Investigating the controls on the composition of water is essential toward understanding source, flow mechanisms, and interactions of waters within a watershed. Current methods described in the literature use hydrogeochemical data {{as a tool for}} advancing watershed science. Little hydrogeochemical data exist for water from the Tuscan and Chico Formations in regional literature. Springs in the Big Chico Creek Ecological Reserve offer a unique opportunity to examine ground water quality from various host rocks in a setting relevant to controls on creek and aquifer water quality and explore recharge processes and interactions between surface and ground water for the valley aquifer system. Previous reconnaissance work by earlier field scientists led to the location of 37 springs {{and the development of a}} database. These early, informal observations included the measurement of field parameters of water temperature, electrical conductivity, and pH for 25 of the springs. These data were instrumental in the selection of springs emanating from the different lithologic strata of the watershed. Tuscan, Chico, and Lovejoy Formation springs were sampled for standard field hydrologic parameters and major ion analyses. Interpretations concerning hydrologic and geologic controls that affect the hydrochemistry of the watershed are be made by comparing reported data for Big Chico Creek and ground water from near-creek wells to spring water chemistry data. Water chemistry was interpreted through graphical modeling techniques and numerical modeling. Collected spring water chemistry shows significant variations corresponding to bedrock lithology but little seasonal variation. Little evidence exists for vertical hydrologic connectivity between the Tuscan and Chico Formations from the formation springs sampled. Lack of connectivity appears to indicate that Chico Formation springs are fed by perched water, near-surface seepage, seepage from crevices and fractures or other forms of preferential flow. Tuscan Formation spring water appears to be young leading to the assertion that these <b>springs</b> discharge <b>perched</b> water or seepage from crevices and fractures. The ground waters of these two formations within the middle reach of the watershed may also be separated by strata that function as aquitards. Reported creek water chemistry shows seasonal variations with a strong meteoric component and lower concentrations at high discharge. During base flow, Big Chico Creek is a mixture of discharge from the Tuscan and Chico Formations. Additional processes, which have not been identified in this study, occur within the watershed affecting the chemistry of waters discharging to the stream. Additional water sources not identified in this study, discharge to the stream during runoff. Reported ground water chemistry is similar to the Tuscan Formation spring end member and shows influence from dilute creek water under runoff conditions. Some reported ground water samples indicate influence from the Chico Formation. CSU, Chic...|$|R

Professor Challenger raised his hand in the air as a signal, and at once our colleague, Mr. E. D. Malone, was observed to rise and to make his way {{to the back of the}} platform. An instant later he re-appeared in company of a gigantic negro, the two of them bearing between them a large square packing-case. It was evidently of great weight, and was slowly carried forward and placed in front of the Professor's chair. All sound had hushed in the audience and everyone was absorbed in the spectacle before them. Professor Challenger drew off the top of the case, which formed a sliding lid. Peering down into the box he snapped his fingers several times and was heard from the Press seat to say, 'Come, then, pretty, pretty!' in a coaxing voice. An instant later, with a scratching, rattling sound, a most horrible and loathsome creature appeared from below and perched itself upon the side of the case. Even the unexpected fall of the Duke of Durham into the orchestra, which occurred at this moment, could not distract the petrified attention of the vast audience. The face of the creature was like the wildest gargoyle that the imagination of a mad medieval builder could have conceived. It was malicious, horrible, with two small red eyes as bright as points of burning coal. Its long, savage mouth, which was held half-open, was full of a double row of shark-like teeth. Its shoulders were humped, and round them were draped what appeared to be a faded gray shawl. It was the devil of our childhood in person. There was a turmoil in the audience--someone screamed, two ladies in the front row fell senseless from their chairs, and there was a general movement upon the platform to follow their chairman into the orchestra. For a moment there was danger of a general panic. Professor Challenger threw up his hands to still the commotion, but the movement alarmed the creature beside him. Its strange shawl suddenly unfurled, spread, and fluttered as a pair of leathery wings. Its owner grabbed at its legs, but too late to hold it. It had <b>sprung</b> from the <b>perch</b> and was circling slowly round the Queen's Hall with a dry, leathery flapping of its ten-foot wings, while a putrid and insidious odor pervaded the room. The cries of the people in the galleries, who were alarmed at the near approach of those glowing eyes and that murderous beak, excited the creature to a frenzy. Faster and faster it flew, beating against walls and chandeliers in a blind frenzy of alarm. 'The window! For heaven's sake shut that window!' roared the Professor from the platform, dancing and wringing his hands in an agony of apprehension. Alas, his warning was too late! In a moment the creature, beating and bumping along the wall like a huge moth within a gas-shade, came upon the opening, squeezed its hideous bulk through it, and was gone. Professor Challenger fell back into his chair with his face buried in his hands, while the audience gave one long, deep sigh of relief as they realized that the incident was over.|$|R

Therefore, a prey type with less energetic value than its energetic return of the capture success is bound to be dropped. Learning improves prey cognition and handling efficiency of the individual and can alter the ratio of gains to costs related with foraging on previously consumed prey. If the uptake of food resources in a specific habitat is linked to a certain habitat-specific predation risk, a trade-off exists between foraging and predator avoidance that may severely affect behaviour and activity levels. Juvenile fish need habitats with high structural complexity as feeding grounds as well as a refuge against predators. Non-natural water bodies often differ immensely from natural lakes and most important repeatedly lack structural diversity in the littoral area. At steep banks lacking structural diversity, planted floatable textile mats may be thus an alternative to establish littoral elements to minimise structural deficiencies. The objective of this study was to analyse the functionality of such plant islands for the invertebrate fauna and the juvenile fish community. This study showed that artificial plant islands can enhance structural heterogeneity and food supply, therefore being beneficial for recruitment of juvenile fish in gravel pit lakes, when densely vegetated and connectivity between shoreline and the islands� root cavities is provided. As foraging behaviour and predator avoidance are dependent on size, two size classes of YOY perch were analysed in tank experiments, using a passive integrated transponder system. The fish were able to increase their potential food intake by entering a compartment in which small cyprinids were provided as prey fishes, but where also a predator (pike) was present. When prey fish were present, the large YOY perch significantly increased the activity level in the test tank while the small size class perch did not. Activity periods of small perch shifted to daylight under the threat of predation while large perch were more active during the twilight periods. These results provide evidence that small and large size YOY perch adjusted the trade-off between foraging and predator avoidance in dependence to size. To gain better understanding on the effect experience has on the behavioural consequences of food selection YOY perch were trained on different food resources. These trained perch and untrained specimen from the field were offered a fixed concentration of zooplankton with different levels of fish or a novel food resource, Limnomysis benedenii. The latter was selected only at high energetic values. Although fish was the preferred prey for all groups of YOY perch, only trained perch (piscivorous and planktivorous) positively selected fish at all energetic values offered. Not only experience in food resources, but also previously experienced predation pressure influenced perch behaviour. YOY perch exhibit a complex mode of behaviour with regards to feeding behaviour allowing them to change strategies when necessary. To conduct studies concerning the ecology of fish population it is essential to get fish samples which truly reflect the population structure. Capture success of different fishing techniques depends mainly on the activity of individuals, their abundance and the habitat where each method is applied. In shallow experimental ponds and gravel pit lakes the capture success of multi-mesh gillnetting and electrofishing was examined. Additionally, in the deep gravel pit lakes bongo-net fishing was used in <b>spring</b> to monitor <b>perch</b> larvae in the pelagic zone after hatching. The three methods were compared and recommendations how to improve fish stock assessment were given. It is then important to preserve and store caught fish as it is often not possible to analyse individuals in the field. In this study, juvenile perch were measured and frozen at - 20 °C, preserved in 70 % ethanol or 4 % formalin and remeasured after 24 h, 3 days, 7 days and then on a weekly basis for eight weeks. Ethanol strongly decreased length and weight of preserved perch. Formalin preservation also led to comparable length reduction but increased the weight of preserved perch. In contrast, frozen perch showed less shrinkage and only moderate weight loss. In the morphometric analysis also freezing clearly revealed the lowest shape differences compared to fresh fish. Hence, freezing is recommended as the most preferable preservation method, especially in multi-disciplinary studies on fish ecology...|$|R
