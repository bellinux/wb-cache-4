The experimental apparatus was characterized by 3 reactors, each with a useful volume of 5 L. The different phases of the work carried out were: determining the basic components of the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of the stillages; determining the specific production of biogas; and estimating the rapidly biodegradable COD contained in the <b>stillages.</b> In particular, the main goal of the anaerobic digestion tests on <b>stillages</b> was to measure the parameters of Specific Gas Production (SGP) and Gas Production Rate (GPR) in reactors in which <b>stillages</b> were being digested using ASBR (Anaerobic Sequencing Batch Reactor) technology. Runs were developed with increasing concentrations of the feed. The optimal loads for obtaining the maximum SGP and GPR values were 8 – 9 gCOD L- 1 and 0. 9 gCOD g- 1 VS...|$|R

This paper analyses a special case of an order picking system, where the warehouse is divided into zones with shelves being arranged {{in the shape of}} a U in each of the zones. The paper assumes that the shelves of the order picking system are made up of two rows of <b>stillages</b> that can be flexibly exchanged and that the base of the order picking process can be moved within the aisle prior to the beginning of the order picking process. We describe the order picking system in a formal model and propose different storage location assignment policies whose efficiency is compared in a numerical study.

500|$|Cask-conditioned ales (or cask ales) are {{unfiltered}} and unpasteurised beers. These beers are termed [...] "real ale" [...] by the CAMRA organisation. Typically, when a cask {{arrives in}} a pub, it is placed horizontally on a frame called a [...] "stillage" [...] {{which is designed}} to hold it steady and at the right angle, and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature (typically between [...] ), before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a (usually rubber) bung at the bottom of one end, and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole {{in the side of the}} cask, which is now uppermost. The act of <b>stillaging</b> and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment, so it must be left for a suitable period to [...] "drop" [...] (clear) again, as well as to fully condition — this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days. At this point the beer is ready to sell, either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump, or simply being [...] "gravity-fed" [...] directly into the glass.|$|R

5000|$|Between 1948 and 1952, {{the company}} sold {{a large number}} of Graiseley PCVs to United Dairies. In 1953 they {{demonstrated}} a <b>stillage</b> truck at the Factory Equipment Exhibition in London. It had a [...] motor, and two speeds. The platform, which was 6 in above ground level, could be raised to 9 in. They also showed battery electric road vehicles at an exhibition organised by the South Eastern Electricity Board and the Electric Vehicle Association. In 1954 they added another <b>stillage</b> truck, the XL1, to their range, showcasing it at the Mechanical Handling Exhibition at Olympia. They showcased their GP20 pedestrial controlled pallet truck at the same exhibition two years later. Manufacture of the vehicles ceased at Wolverhampton around 1960, when Diamond Motors were liquidated.|$|E

Created by founder, Michael Myers, El Paso County Process is the action of taking a finished beer, boiling off the alcohol and using a percentage of that <b>stillage</b> mixed with a water mash in the next batch.|$|E
5000|$|Stillages {{are mainly}} used to {{transport}} goods {{without the need}} to load and unload the product being carried, which saves time and decreases the chance of damage.

50|$|A {{refinement}} often dubiously {{credited to}} James C. Crow was the sour mash process, by which each new fermentation is conditioned with some amount of spent mash. Spent mash {{is also known}} as spent beer, distillers' spent grain, <b>stillage,</b> and slop or feed mash, so named because it is used as animal feed. The acid introduced by using the sour mash controls the growth of bacteria that could taint the whiskey and creates a proper pH balance for the yeast to work.|$|E
50|$|A <b>stillage</b> {{need not}} be {{complicated}} - anything that will support a cask (preferably on three points to avoid any wobbling) will do. At temporary events, sturdy tables or frames made of scaffolding and planks might be used, with the casks placed on wooden wedges (two at the front, one at the back). At {{the other end of}} the scale, many pub cellars use specially-made steel racking, often with two rows of casks one above the other. Some pubs have brick or stone stillages, sometimes quite ancient, built into the wall of the cellar.|$|E
50|$|If a pub is well-provided with handpumps, it {{can put on}} a small festival by {{rotating}} guest beers rapidly through them. Alternatively a temporary <b>stillage</b> may be set up inside the bar, or in a tent outside. Pub-based festivals usually last a weekend, (in fact, often a long weekend).The pubco Wetherspoons holds simultaneous festivals twice-yearly in all the hundreds of branch in its chain, lasting over two weeks, and using the handpump rotation method. It claims its festivals are Britain's largest. The number of different beers that can be provided in a pub festival ranges from about 15 to about 100.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike kegs, {{which can}} be simply stood upright on the floor, casks are used lying on their sides. This allows the beer to run from the tap under gravity, with room in the [...] "belly" [...] of the cask below the outlet for the finings to collect. The shive with the spile will then be the highest point on the cask. As the beer clears (see finings), {{the inside of the}} cask becomes coated with sediment. It is {{important}} that the <b>stillage</b> holds the cask absolutely still with no rocking or shaking, otherwise the sediment will be shaken into suspension and the beer will be cloudy.|$|E
50|$|In {{the inner}} {{town and the}} suburbs are many wells and springs. The best known {{of these is the}} goose {{fountain}}, built at the train station in 1981 by Gudrun Schreiner. The fountain represents Gaggenau's founding legend that claims the town of Gaggenau was founded on a spot where geese gathered on a large pond. The town of Gaggenau was named from the cackling of the geese. Hörden also has an interesting fountain, the Fountain Rafters, designed to recall the traditional local craft of raftsmen. The gargoyles represent traditional characters of the Hörden Carnival: The Fürigen Barthel, the <b>stillage</b> and Domino. In the district and former town of Bad Rotenfels, an old draw-well tray was rediscovered by the lower acorn mountain road by the local heritage society and restored for public display.|$|E
5000|$|The {{entire process}} takes between 40 and 50 hours, {{during which time}} the mash is kept cool and {{agitated}} {{in order to facilitate}} yeast activity. After the process is complete, everything is transferred to distillation columns where the ethanol is removed from the [...] "stillage". The ethanol is dehydrated to about 200 proof using a molecular sieve system and a denaturant such as gasoline is added to render the product undrinkable. With this last addition, the process is complete and the product is ready to ship to gasoline retailers or terminals. The remaining <b>stillage</b> then undergoes a different process to produce a highly nutritious livestock feed. The carbon dioxide released from the process is also utilized to carbonate beverages and to aid in the manufacturing of dry ice.|$|E
50|$|Larger British beer festivals {{are usually}} held in large indoor venues (Kensington Olympia {{in the case}} of the GBBF). Casks of ale from {{different}} brewers, numbering in the hundreds, are placed on <b>stillage</b> behind rows of trestle tables. Staff serve beer directly from the cask and take payment in the form of cash or tokens purchased at the entrance. Cooling is achieved using wet sacking or blankets for evaporative cooling or though refrigerated cooling saddles and coils. Glasses are distributed at the entrance to the venue, usually for a small deposit although often included in the entrance fee, often bearing a design specific to the festival. A beer list is usually available, often indicating where in the venue the different casks will be situated. Food is usually available, and entertainments and games such as live music, pub quizzes or tombolas are often organised.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the sour}} mash process, the mash [...] - [...] {{a mixture of}} grain, malt and water [...] - [...] is {{conditioned}} with some amount of spent mash (previously fermented mash that still contains live yeast). Spent mash {{is also known as}} spent beer, distillers' spent grain, <b>stillage,</b> and slop or feed mash, so named because it is used as animal feed. The acid introduced by using the sour mash controls the growth of bacteria that could taint the whiskey and creates a proper pH balance for the yeast to work. An established and active strain of live yeast is introduced into the mash that is to be fermented. By using an established and known fermented [...] "sour", this fermentation process controls the introduction and growth of foreign bacteria and yeasts that could damage the whiskey, and improves the consistency and quality of the liquor, so that every bottle tastes as close to the same as possible.|$|E
50|$|Graiseley Electric Vehicles were {{produced}} in Wolverhampton by Diamond Motors Ltd, a company which previously had made motorcycles, and which bought the sidecar business from AJS when that company was liquidated in 1931. Included {{in the sale}} was the Graiseley marque, and this was used {{for a range of}} three-wheeled battery-electric pedestrian controlled milk trucks. They soon found that they could sell into other industries as well. In 1937 they produced a ride-on four wheeled vehicle, suitable for a payload of 8-10 cwt, and with a range of around 35 mi. Nevertheless, it was for their pedestrian controlled vehicles that they were best known, and their range included the Model 60, with a payload of 8-10 cwt, the Model 75, with a 12-15 cwt payload, and the Model 90, which could carry 22 cwt. Because the primary focus was on the dairy industry, the model numbers represented the number of imperial gallons of milk that could be carried. Between 1948 and 1952, the company sold a large number of Graiseley PCVs to United Dairies, and gradually diversified into <b>stillage</b> trucks and pallet trucks for use in factories. The company was liquidated in 1960, but the Graiseley marque was used by Lister Graiseley in 1969 and by Gough Industrial Trucks Ltd of Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent in 1971.|$|E
50|$|Cask beer is the {{traditional}} method of service, via a hand pump or by gravity straight from the cask on <b>stillage.</b> Cask conditioned beer is unfiltered, unpasteurized and lacking artificial carbonation (the bubbles are produced by the ongoing fermentation), giving it a limited shelf-life. This dispense method is strongly associated with ale, {{although there is no}} technical barrier to serving lager or stout this way. Most pubs use hand pumps ("beer engines") to draw the beer, whereas stillages are commonly employed at beer festivals. Cask ale and bottle conditioned beer are championed by the Campaign for Real Ale under the name real ale. Prior to stainless steel casks, beer was delivered in large wooden barrels, which were delivered to the cellar via a trap-door on the footpath using two ropes wound about the barrels midriff (a parbuckle) to lower the barrel gently down the cellar's ramp. They then had to stand on their sides for a few days so the sediment would settle {{to the bottom of the}} belly of the barrel, after which they would be 'tapped' by punching the pre-cut centre of the (traditionally cork) bung (at the lower edge of the barrel end) into the barrel by hitting the tapered brass 'tap' with a mallet. One could then attach the pipe connector onto the tap, so that the cellarman could turn the tap on when ready. In a similar manner, one would punch through the centre of a bung on the upper side of the barrel's belly with a hardwood spile (tapered peg). The hardwood spile prevents air access. Once the barrel is in use, the spile is replaced with a 'soft' spile, traditionally made from softwood, but nowadays from bonded-together (woody) fibres. The soft spile prevents a vacuum forming at the upper surface of the beer: it allows sufficient air in for the beer engine to work, but keeps dust, flies and other mischief-makers out.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{bioethanol}} production {{with the}} thin <b>stillage</b> recirculation in mashing was investigated. The mashing was performed with recirculation of: 0, 10, 20 and 30 % of the thin <b>stillage.</b> The thin <b>stillage</b> recirculation was repeated six times. In the experiment without the thin <b>stillage,</b> the recirculation bioethanol yield (compared to the theoretical yield) was 97. 96 %, which implicates that the experiment conditions were chosen and performed well. With {{the addition of}} the thin <b>stillage,</b> the bioethanol yield increased and was above 100 %. Higher bioethanol yield than 100 % {{can be explained by the}} fact that the thin <b>stillage</b> contains carbohydrates, amino acids and yeast cells degradation products. The bioethanol yield increased with the increased number of thin <b>stillage</b> recirculation cycles. Dry matter content in fermenting slurry increased with the increased thin <b>stillage</b> quantity and the number of the thin <b>stillage</b> recirculation cycles (8. 04 % for the first and 9. 40 % for the sixth cycle). Dry matter content in thin <b>stillage</b> increased with the increased thin <b>stillage</b> quantity and the number of thin <b>stillage</b> recirculation cycles.

40|$|Abstract Background This study aims to {{chemically}} characterize thin <b>stillage</b> {{derived from}} lignocellulosic biomass distillation residues {{in terms of}} organic strength, nutrient, and mineral content. The feasibility of performing anaerobic digestion on these stillages at mesophilic (40  °C) and thermophilic (55  °C) temperatures to produce methane was demonstrated. The microbial communities involved were further characterized. Results Energy and sugar cane <b>stillage</b> have a high chemical oxygen demand (COD of 43 and 30  g/L, respectively) and low pH (pH 4. 3). Furthermore, the acetate concentration in sugar cane <b>stillage</b> was high (45  mM) but was not detected in energy cane <b>stillage.</b> There was also a high amount of lactate in both types of <b>stillage</b> (35 – 37  mM). The amount of sugars was 200 times higher in energy cane <b>stillage</b> compared to sugar cane <b>stillage.</b> Although there was {{a high concentration of}} sulfate (18 and 23  mM in sugar and energy cane <b>stillage,</b> respectively), both thin stillages were efficiently digested anaerobically with high COD removal under mesophilic and thermophilic temperature conditions and with an organic loading rate of 15 – 21  g COD/L/d. The methane production rate was 0. 2  L/g COD, with a methane percentage of 60 and 64, and 92 and 94  % soluble COD removed, respectively, by the mesophilic and thermophilic reactors. Although both treatment processes were equally efficient, there were different microbial communities involved possibly arising from the differences in the composition of energy cane and sugar cane <b>stillage.</b> There was more acetic acid in sugar cane <b>stillage</b> which may have promoted the occurrence of aceticlastic methanogens to perform a direct conversion of acetate to methane in reactors treating sugar cane <b>stillage.</b> Conclusions Results showed that thin <b>stillage</b> contains easily degradable compounds suitable for anaerobic digestion and that hybrid reactors can efficiently convert thin <b>stillage</b> to methane under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. Furthermore, we found that optimal conditions for biological treatment of thin <b>stillage</b> were similar for both mesophilic and thermophilic reactors. Bar-coded pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene identified different microbial communities in mesophilic and thermophilic reactors and these differences in the microbial communities could be linked to the composition of the thin <b>stillage...</b>|$|E
