40|$|International audienceThe {{contribution}} of entropy change due to stretching of polymer chains in promoting crystal nucleation is theoretically derived for strain-induced crystallization of natural rubber. The results of theoretical calculation are compared with experimental results obtained by fast time-resolved wide-angle X-ray diffraction. Usual values of <b>surface</b> <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> corresponding to chain-folded nuclei lead to theoretical results far from experimental measurements.

40|$|Previously a new {{universal}} -integration {{path and}} associated methodology {{was developed for}} the calculation of "exact" <b>surface</b> and interfacial <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> of solids. Such a method is in principle applicable to any intermolecular potential function, including those based on ab initio methods, but in previous work the method was only tested using a relatively simple embedded atom method iron potential. In this present work we apply the new methodology to the more sophisticated and more accurate modified embedded atom method (MEAM) iron potential, where application of other free- energy methods would be extremely difficult due to the complex many-body nature of the potential. We demonstrate that the new technique simplifies the process of obtaining "exact" <b>surface</b> <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> by calculating the complete set of these properties for the low index surface faces of bcc and fcc solid iron structures. By combining these data with further calculations of liquid surface tensions we obtain the first complete set of exact <b>surface</b> <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> for the solid and liquid phases of a realistic MEAM model system.

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> {{of dental}} hard tissues, {{including}} salivary conditioning films on enamel, {{play a crucial}} role in mineralization, dissolution and adhesion processes at the tooth surface. These mineralization reactions at oral surfaces control the development and progression of various diseases. In this paper, we compare the <b>surface</b> <b>free</b> <b>energies,</b> as derived from measured contact angles with liquids, of salivary conditioning films on enamel after exposure to dentifrices with and without anti-calculus additives, such as hexametaphosphate, pyrophosphate or zinc citrate trihydrate. Measured contact angles were converted to <b>surface</b> <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> using the concept of Lifshitz-Van der Waals and Lewis acid base components. Nearly all dentifrices yield film properties with a negative interfacial tension against an aqueous phase, which thermodynamically opposes mineralization. Concurrent with negative interfacial tensions, are positive values of the interfacial <b>free</b> <b>energy</b> of adhesion for octacalcium-phosphate (OCP) to the film surfaces, indicating that adhesion of newly mineralized, calcium-phosphate rich phases is thermodynamically unfavorable. Interestingly, two out of the three dentifrices with anti-calculus additives containing hexametaphosphate and pyrophosphate cause most positive interfacial <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> for OCP adhesion of 5. 8 and 2. 6 mJ/mZ, respectively. In summary, surface thermodynamical analyses indicate that anti-calculus effects of commercial dentifrice formulations are consistent with more negative interfacial tensions of salivary conditioning films on enamel surfaces and thus with more positive values for the interfacial <b>free</b> <b>energy</b> of adhesion toward newly formed mineral phases. A dentifrice containing hexametaphosphate yielded thermodynamic properties of salivary conditioning films most unfavorable for calculus formation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

In this work, {{the effects}} of atmospheric-pressure plasma {{treatment}} of polyimide films on surface and dielectric characteristics were studied by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), <b>surface</b> <b>free</b> <b>energies,</b> and dielectric spectrometer. The total <b>surface</b> <b>free</b> <b>energies</b> and dielectric constants of plasma treated polyimide film were deareased with increasing the treatment time, which was mainly due to a lower London-dispersive component, while the specific component was increased. This {{could be attributed to}} an increase of the polar fluorine groups of polyimide per unit surface area. And the fluorine content of the polyimide film was increased with increasing the amount of the treatment time, resulting in decreasing dielectric constant of the film.
