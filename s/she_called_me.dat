500|$|After Khia {{was given}} a diminished role in the music video, {{she went to her}} MySpace account to say she was not pleased with her scenes being {{displayed}} in a TV during the music video, and criticized Jackson. Despite that, Khia said years later that the situation was calmed down, and wrote a song with Jackson in mind. However, she did not regret the feedback she gave the singer, stating, [...] "I don't say anything that I don't mean. I meant every word that I said. People mix the truth with hate, but no I didn't appreciate her putting me on the television. A lot of people blew that out of proportion like, 'Oh my god, Khia's hating on Janet,' but <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> and we were okay. It's just me voicing the situation to my fans".|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for the {{extended}} remix of [...] "Video Phone" [...] {{was directed by}} Hype Williams, along with producer Cisco Newman and art director Lenny Tso. On October 15, 2009, a spokesperson for Williams confirmed to MTV, that reports of Gaga and Beyoncé working on the music video together were true. It was shot at Brooklyn's Greenpoint neighborhood, under tight security. The artists were reported to be wearing fashionable dresses, with Knowles in [...] "a feathered dress" [...] and Gaga sporting [...] "something wild". In an interview with New York's Z100 radio station, Gaga further commented on her collaboration with Knowles, for the music video. She said, [...] "When I was doing her video with her, <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> and she said, 'What {{do you want to}} do?' [...] And I'm like, 'I don't want to show up in some frickin' hair bow and be fashion Gaga in your video.' I said, 'I want to do you.' [...] I want to do my version of Beyoncé. So the whole time I was learning the choreography they were calling me Gee-yoncé." [...] Later, during an interview with MTV News, she explained: ...|$|E
2500|$|Afterwards, Kojima {{designed}} and released [...] for the PlayStation 2. Unlike the previous {{games in the}} series, {{which took place in}} the near future and focused on indoor locations, the game is set in a Soviet jungle {{during the height of the}} Cold War in 1964, and features wilderness survival, camouflage, and James Bond styled espionage. The North American version was released on November 17, 2004, with the Japanese counterpart following on December 16. The European version was released on March 4, 2005. Critical response to the game was highly favorable. Kojima has said that his mother played it, [...] "It took her an entire year to complete Metal Gear Solid 3. She would get her friends to help her. When she defeated The End, [...] <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> up and said: 'It is finished'." ...|$|E

2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and <b>she</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.|$|E

I was pleasantly surprised by her. <b>She</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> one day and asked if she could bring her sister along with her onto location. I said, 'Sure, of course, no problem.' And I was delighted because she was going out {{with the head of the}} studio. She could have been the biggest pain in the ass alive. And I would be in a terribly awkward position if she started with the limousines and the special means and whatever the hell it is—or complaining about whatever. But never a peep out of her. Most pleasant, most charming, very cooperative, very hard-working. She was always there half an hour before her call and she always stayed on for a half hour just in case. Interested in everything that went on, and was a total joy. I couldn't ask for a more cooperative actor." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{have not}} yet called her by her name in this letter, but we are such friends now that I do so when we are quietly together, and she speaks {{to me by my}} name--I mean, not my Christian name, but the name you gave me.

60|$|We went; {{following}} the superintendent's guidance, {{we had to}} thread some intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.
