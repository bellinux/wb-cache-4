25|$|The {{green heron}} (Butorides virescens) and its sister species the <b>striated</b> <b>heron</b> (Butorides striata) have been {{recorded}} using food (bread crusts), insects, leaves, and other small objects as bait to attract fish, which they then capture and eat.|$|E
25|$|Use of bait: Several {{species of}} bird, {{including}} herons {{such as the}} <b>striated</b> <b>heron</b> (Butorides striatus), will place bread in water to attract fish. Whether this is tool use is disputed because the bread is not manipulated or held by the bird.|$|E
25|$|Other nesting native birds include red-tailed tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda), wedge-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus), Audubon's shearwater (Puffinus iherminierii), black-naped terns (Sterna sumatrana), white (or fairy) terns (Gygis alba), <b>striated</b> <b>herons</b> (Butorides striatus), and white-breasted waterhens (Amaurornis phoenicurus). The 680-hectare Barton Point Nature Reserve was {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area for its large breeding colony of red-footed boobies.|$|R
50|$|Some {{species of}} heron, {{such as the}} little egret and grey heron, have been {{documented}} using bait to lure prey to within striking distance. Herons may use items already in place, or actively add items to the water to attract fish such as the banded killifish. Items used may be man-made, such as bread; alternatively, <b>striated</b> <b>herons</b> in the Amazon have been watched repeatedly dropping seeds, insects, flowers, and leaves into the water to catch fish.|$|R
50|$|The {{capped heron}} is {{normally}} solitary, {{although there are}} cases {{where they have been}} found in couples or groups. Birds may be seen with other species such as snowy egrets (Egretta thula) and scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber), however other studies have found that they avoid large mixed-species flocks, appearing in fewer than 1% of 145 observed feeding aggregations. Capped herons appear to be submissive to great egrets (Ardea alba), but dominant to snowy egrets (Egretta thula) and <b>striated</b> <b>herons</b> (Butorides striatus).|$|R
25|$|The {{habitat of}} the green heron is small {{wetlands}} in low-lying areas. The species is most conspicuous during dusk and dawn, and if anything these birds are nocturnal rather than diurnal, preferring to retreat to sheltered areas in daytime. They feed actively during the day, however, if hungry or provisioning young. Shore-living individuals adapt {{to the rhythm of}} the tides. They mainly eat small fish, frogs and aquatic arthropods, but may take any invertebrate or vertebrate prey they can catch, including such animals like leeches and mice. Green herons are intolerant of other birds – including conspecifics – when feeding and are not seen to forage in groups. They typically stand still on shore or in shallow water or perch upon branches and await prey. Sometimes they drop food, insects, or other small objects on the water's surface to attract fish, making them one of the few known tool-using species. This feeding method has led some to title the green and closely related <b>striated</b> <b>heron</b> as among the world's most intelligent birds. They are able to hover briefly to catch prey.|$|E

25|$|Dozens of {{different}} bird species {{may be seen}} foraging in the rich mudflats in and around mangrove flats many of these birds being threatened with extinction and protected by international agreements. Commonly seen bird species include Eastern curlews (Numenius madagascariensis), <b>striated</b> <b>herons</b> (Butorides striatus), brown honeyeaters (Lichmera indistincta), little egrets (Egretta garzetta), royal spoonbills (Platalea regia), white-faced grey herons (Egretta novaehollandiae), Australasian little bitterns (Ixobrychus dubius), pied oystercatchers (Haematopus longirostris), Australasian pelican (Pelecanus conspicillatus), sacred ibis (Threskiornis moluccus), chestnut teal (Anas castanea) and azure kingfishers (Alcedo azurea).|$|R
50|$|The island hosts over 300,000 nesting seabirds {{of seven}} species. A large colony, {{dominated}} by lesser noddies, but including about 1300 pairs of brown noddies, is present from May to September during the south-east monsoon. During the north-west monsoon, the hill supports a breeding colony of wedge-tailed shearwaters. Year-round breeders include white and bridled terns, white-tailed tropicbirds and some 1000-1,500 pairs of Audubon's shearwaters. Several hundred great and lesser frigatebirds use {{the island for}} roosting and can be seen soaring over it. Some waders are present throughout the year, the commonest being the ruddy turnstone. Common moorhens and <b>striated</b> <b>herons</b> also breed on the island.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a member}} of the Ixobrychus genus that {{contains}} many of the smallest herons in the world. Going on reported length, from 25 to 30 cm, this is perhaps the smallest species of heron. The weight is similar to other Ixobrychus species, reportedly from 60 to 150 g, averaging 75 - 110 g. The wingspan reportedly averages 45 to 50 cm. The male has a dark slate grey head and neck, with elongated head and neck feathers. The bill is dark overall, being black to dark green on top and yellow on the lower bill. The lores and orbital skin are blue to yellow green and the irises are red brown to dark red. The back, upper wings and other upper parts are dark slate grey. Its throat and upper breast are pale buff, darkening to tawny on the abdomen, heavily streaked black. The legs and feet are green yellow in front and yellow in back. In courtship legs and feet turn bright orange. The female is paler, with a more rufous tinge on its belly and yellow irises. The immature bird is a more buff and pale version than the adult. It is distinguished from the black bittern of Asia by its striped belly, dark neck tufts, shorter, darker bill and much smaller size. It is distinguished from the green and <b>striated</b> <b>herons</b> by its smaller size and slow flight, its pale and heavily streaked underparts, and its uniform (not barred) upper parts.|$|R
50|$|Widespread and {{generally}} common, the <b>striated</b> <b>heron</b> {{is classified as}} a species of least concern by the IUCN; this holds true whether the lava heron is included in B. striata or not.|$|E

50|$|The river {{supports}} {{a wide variety}} of fish including barramundi and mangrove jack.The occasional salt water crocodile is also spotted in the river.Bird species such as black swans, the <b>striated</b> <b>heron,</b> Australian bustard and bush stone-curlew can be found along the river's banks.|$|E
50|$|Oman is {{becoming}} increasingly popular with bird watchers. More than 460 different bird species have been recorded in Oman, out of which, 80 species have been classified as resident, while the rest are migrant and seasonal species. Oman offers {{a unique opportunity to}} watch birds from Europe, Africa and Asia in one spot during their annual migrations in spring and autumn. These migratory periods coincide with the cooler weather between October and April. Some of the common resident species one expects to see within or around Muscat include: <b>herons</b> (<b>striated</b> and western reef), ospreys, swift terns, laughing doves, Egyptian vultures, and Indian roller. Common migrant and seasonal species include: cattle egret, little stint, greater flamingo, Caspian gull, spotted flycatcher, grey heron, dunlin, Sandwich tern, red and green shanks, ruff and white wagtail.|$|R

50|$|Birds {{recorded}} {{from the}} reserve include the fulvous whistling duck, blue-winged teal, osprey, wattled jacana, black-necked stilt, cocoi heron, <b>striated</b> <b>heron,</b> anhinga and neotropic cormorant. Of special interest are the grayish piculet, apical flycatcher, bar-crested antshrike and the scrub tanager. The reserve also supports {{the only remaining}} population of the horned screamer in the region.|$|E
50|$|The rich {{communities}} of oysters, crabs, invertebrates {{and the great}} variety of fish sheltering and spawning in the mangroves sustain animal life including monkeys, African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis), and turtles like the African softshell turtle (Trionyx triunguis). Birds include breeding waterbirds such as <b>striated</b> <b>heron</b> and reed cormorant and large flocks of others during migration.|$|E

50|$|Mangrove swamps are {{important}} feeding grounds for fish, birds and animals. Marine wildlife includes oysters and shrimps. Mammals found here include the African manatee. Birds in these wet habitats include Goliath heron, purple heron, cattle egret, <b>striated</b> <b>heron,</b> western reef heron, greater flamingo, lesser flamingo, African spoonbill, and African sacred ibis. The forests also provide important habitat for migratory birds.|$|E
5000|$|Butorides is a genus {{of small}} herons. It {{contains}} three similar species, the green heron or green-backed heron, Butorides virescens, the lava heron (Butorides sundevalli), and the <b>striated</b> <b>heron,</b> Butorides striatus. A fossil species, Butorides validipes, is {{known from the}} Early Pleistocene of Florida in the United States. Butorides is from Middle English Butor [...] "bittern" [...] and Ancient Greek -oides, [...] "resembling".|$|E
50|$|Several {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} and the common species include the <b>striated</b> <b>heron</b> and western reef heron. Other species that have been recorded include the little bittern, black bittern, red knot, jack snipe and pied avocet (on transient sandbanks). The sanctuary is also host to mudskippers, fiddler crabs and other mangrove habitat specialists. A species of crustacean Teleotanais indianis was described based on specimens obtained in the sanctuary.|$|E
50|$|Threatened and {{vulnerable}} species include West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), pearly parakeet (Pyrrhura lepida), bearded bellbird (Procnias averano), wattled jacana (Jacana jacana) and American purple gallinule (Porphyrula martinica).Other bird species include <b>striated</b> <b>heron</b> (Butorides striata), black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), great egret (Ardea alba), ringed kingfisher (Megaceryle torquata), blue dacnis (Dacnis cayana), rufescent tiger heron (Tigrisoma lineatum), white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata), Neotropic cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) and white-winged swallow (Tachycineta albiventer).|$|E
50|$|Vegetation {{is mostly}} from the Atlantic Forest ecosystem.Below 1100 m it is mostly dense montane {{rainforest}}.From 1100 to 2000 m there is mixed dense rainforest and upper montane forest, with specimens of Araucaria angustifolia (Brazilian pine). Above 1800 m there are areas of open fields or rocky fields.Endemic fauna include the Maldonada redbelly toad (Melanophryniscus moreirae).Migratory species include the great egret (Ardea alba), snowy egret (Egretta thula) and <b>striated</b> <b>heron</b> (Butorides striata).|$|E
5000|$|The lava heron (Butorides sundevalli), {{also known}} as the Galápagos heron, is a species of heron endemic to the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador. It is {{considered}} by some authorities — including the American Ornithological Society and BirdLife International — to be a subspecies (or even just a colour morph) of the <b>striated</b> <b>heron</b> (B. striata), and was formerly [...] "lumped" [...] with this species and the green heron (B. virescens) as the green-backed heron.|$|E
5000|$|Locally extinct land birds found were <b>striated</b> <b>heron,</b> spotless crake, Polynesian ground dove, Marquesan {{imperial}} pigeon, Polynesian imperial pigeon, and Tahiti reed warbler. The only globally extinct seabird was the Huahine gull, {{but several}} other seabirds {{that are now}} locally extinct, at least as breeders, were found, including the wedge-tailed shearwater, Christmas shearwater, Audubon's shearwater, Tahiti petrel, phoenix petrel, Trindade petrel, brown booby, red-footed booby, great frigatebird, lesser frigatebird, and black noddy.|$|E
50|$|The grasslands {{within the}} park are {{dominated}} by cogon grass and talahib. In the hilly areas grow forest tree species such as ipil-ipil, madre cacao and hauili. They provide the habitat for many migratory bird species such as the great egret, little egret, little heron, <b>striated</b> <b>heron,</b> plover, charadrius sp., whimbrel, common redshank, common greenshank, common tern and whiskered tern. Other wildlife known to inhabit the area include monitor lizards, wild cats, hornbills, owls, wild doves and bats.|$|E
50|$|An adult {{bird was}} once {{observed}} in a peculiar and mysterious behavior: while on the nest, it would grab a stick in its bill and make a rapid back-and-forth motion with the head, like a sewing machine's needle. The significance of this behavior is completely unknown: While such movements occur in many other nesting birds where they seem to compact the nest, move the eggs, or dislodge parasites, neither {{seems to have been}} the case in this particular <b>striated</b> <b>heron.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>striated</b> <b>heron</b> (Butorides striata) {{also known}} as {{mangrove}} heron, little heron or green-backed heron, is a small heron. Striated herons are mostly non-migratory and noted for some interesting behavioral traits. Their breeding habitat is small wetlands in the Old World tropics from west Africa to Japan and Australia, and in South America. Vagrants have been recorded on oceanic islands, such as Chuuk and Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marianas and Palau; the bird recorded on Yap on February 25, 1991, was from a continental Asian rather than from a Melanesian population, while {{the origin of the}} bird seen on Palau on May 3, 2005 was not clear.|$|E
5000|$|Of all {{the reports}} {{mentioning}} ardeid birds on Réunion, only {{the one of}} Dubois can be assigned to this species. Significantly, Jean Feuilley in 1705 did not mention these birds, and only {{in the second half}} of the 18th century are herons on Réunion referred to again, with the <b>striated</b> <b>heron</b> being the only species found, but [...] "very rare". Thus, the Réunion night heron probably became extinct around 1700. However, as there are no good reasons for its disappearance (neither habitat destruction nor introduced predators would have affected it much, nor does it seem to have a favorite target for hunters), it may have persisted until considerably later.|$|E
50|$|Also {{found on}} Aiwa {{was a single}} bone of a Porzana rail. Apparently this was yet another {{distinct}} species, and if so {{it is likely to}} have occurred on Lakeba too. But until more material turns up and is studied, nothing can be said with certainty, particularly in respect {{of the fact that the}} white-browed crake (P. cinerea) and the spotless crake (P. tabuensis) formerly occurred on Lakeba. Finally, a single bone of the <b>striated</b> <b>heron</b> (Butorides striata) was found on Lakeba; the species does not occur there today, but unless more bones are found it is not sure that it had a self-sustaining population on this island rather than being merely an occasional visitor. Peale's imperial pigeon (Ducula latrans), the Southwest Pacific peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus nesiotes) and the Fiji shrikebill (Clytorhynchus vitiensis) breed on much smaller Aiwa but not on Lakeba; though no bones of these species have been found here to date, it is likely that they formerly occurred on Lakeba too.|$|E
50|$|Shallow water depth, warm, stable temperature, {{and rich}} {{nutrient}} supply from mangrove forests and several rivers running into Phang Nga Bay result in abundant plankton and other marine life. The bay island hosts 26 species of reptiles, 24 species of fish, 14 species of shrimp, 15 species of crab, and 16 species of manta rays, sharks, and game fish. Most fishes {{are typical of}} coral reefs, such as butterflyfish. Other common inhabitants are blue crab, swimming crab, mudskipper, humpback shrimp, mud lobster, pomfret, sole, anchovy, scad, rock cod, rainbow cuttlefish, soft cuttlefish, musk crab, mackerel, moray eel, puffer fish, rabbitfish, groupers, black sea cucumber, brain coral, staghorn coral and flowerlike soft coral. Amphibians include Fejervarya raja, cricket frog (Fejervarya limnocharis) and the common tree frog. Aquatic plants are represented by red algae, Halimeda, seagrass, and plant plankton. There are more than 100 species of birds in the area such as the <b>striated</b> <b>heron,</b> Pacific reef heron, little egret and others.|$|E
