5|$|Parsons, his sons, {{and other}} Confederate {{soldiers}} encountered Union Army cavalry along Grassy Lick Run south of Romney on April 24, 1862. Parsons carried a double-barreled shotgun, {{and proceeded to}} fire his weapon at the Union forces at close range. As Parsons made his escape from the Union Army forces, he saw his son fired upon as he ran across the road, and <b>supposed</b> <b>he</b> had been killed. He traveled {{to the home of}} a Mr.Hott, and told him of the news of his son's possible death. Parsons became pale and was helped down from his horse by Hott's sons, so he would not fall. According to Hott, Parsons died moments later.|$|E
25|$|Slemmer and Gilman {{stepped aside}} and soon {{returned}} {{to say they}} would reply the next day. Slemmer asked Chase how many men he had, whether he could take the fort by storm and how many men {{he thought he would}} lose. Chase replied that he could take the fort but <b>supposed</b> <b>he</b> might lose half of his force. Slemmer responded that he did not believe Chase was willing to make that sacrifice. Chase said that Slemmer must know that Florida could not permit the fort to be held and that an attack would start a civil war. Slemmer said he wanted to consult with the captains of two U.S. Navy vessels in the harbor. The next day, as the Navy vessels withdrew, Slemmer refused the demand for surrender of the fort. He refused a similar demand from Chase on January 18, 1861.|$|E
25|$|First {{trying to}} examine the hole with a {{flashlight}} from above Gómez could see only darkness, so tied with a line of heavy rope around his waist he was lowered by several colleagues, and descending into the murk {{he realized it was}} a perfectly cylindrical shaft. At the bottom he came to rest in apparently ancient construction – a man-made tunnel, blocked in both directions by immense stones. Gómez was acquainted that archaeologists had previously discovered a narrow tunnel underneath the Pyramid of the Sun, and <b>supposed</b> <b>he</b> was now observing a kind of similar mirror tunnel, leading to a subterranean chamber beneath Temple of the Feathered Serpent. He decided initially to elaborate clear hypothesis and to obtain approval. Meanwhile, he erected a tent over the sinkhole to preserve it from {{the hundreds of thousands of}} tourists who visit Teotihuacán. Researchers reported that the tunnel was believed to have been sealed in 200 CE.|$|E

500|$|As captain, Johnson {{was noted}} for his public {{relations}} skills and his gift for public speaking. [...] He was optimistic by nature, with {{a belief in}} [...] "guts and determination". [...] However, he was seen as insensitive at times; Bill Johnston took offence when Johnson attempted to rouse him during a practise session: [...] "Just cos {{you are one of}} the old blokes in the side doesn't mean you don't have to bloody well put in you know." [...] At times his optimism could appear artless and naive. Ian Craighis successor as Australian captainwas critical of Johnson's attitude during the 1956 tour of England: [...] "I don't think [...] was ever realistic about the situation. [...] I <b>supposed</b> <b>he</b> felt obliged to make rallying speeches, but the team knew what was going on." [...] Pat Crawford felt [...] "Johnson couldn't get anything out of the players, whereas the guys would have busted a gut for [...] ". [...] He was seen by some of his team mates as [...] "dictatorial" [...] with [...] Benaud and Harvey particularly resenting Johnson's insistence on the entire touring party attending every lead-in match before 1956 Test series in England.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of Wednesday, February 17, 1897, another crewman, Archibald A. Roof fell off Harvest Queen, and was presumed drowned. [...] The steamer was towing the barkentine Northwest, and nearing the {{confluence}} of the Willamette and the Columbia rivers when Roof was last seen. [...] Shortly after that, Roof was missed, and it was <b>supposed</b> <b>he</b> had fallen off the boat and was drowned. [...] There were no witnesses however.|$|E
2500|$|After {{his return}} to politics, Gyurcsány was at first tight-lipped on his {{religious}} affiliation, leading many to assume {{that he is an}} atheist. In an interview aired on TV2 during the 2006 parliamentary election campaign, Gyurcsány said that as a teenager, he [...] "took part in confirmation for about two years" [...] and even considered becoming a priest. Since confirmation can only be taken once, some regarded this claim as a giveaway that he was not telling the truth, while others such as Catholic bishop Endre Gyulay <b>supposed</b> <b>he</b> meant he took part in preparations for a confirmation.|$|E

2500|$|On May 8, 1872, as {{covered by}} the Washington Star, Mosby {{personally}} thanked now-U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant for that document. Mosby also told Grant he believed vehemently that election of Horace Greeley (a long-time editor of the New York Tribune detested in the South) would be worse for the South because the men surrounding him were worse than those surrounding his old benefactor Grant. A few days later, Massachusetts Congressman Benjamin Butler presented an amnesty bill for former Confederates, as Mosby had suggested in that meeting, and soon President Grant signed it into law. After Greeley became the Democratic party's nominee in July, Mosby became Grant's campaign manager in Virginia, and an active Republican, although he also made sure the Republicans would not run a candidate against his friend and fellow Warrenton attorney Eppa Hunton, who campaigned and won as a Democrat. In his autobiography Grant stated, [...] "Since {{the close of the}} war, I have come to know Colonel Mosby personally and somewhat intimately. He is a different man entirely from what I <b>supposed.</b> ... <b>He</b> is able and thoroughly honest and truthful." ...|$|E
