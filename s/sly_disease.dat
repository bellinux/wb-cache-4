40|$|Neural {{stem cell}} (NSC) {{transplantation}} is a promising strategy for delivering therapeutic proteins in the brain. We evaluated a complete process of ex vivo gene therapy using human induced {{pluripotent stem cell}} (iPSC) -derived NSC transplants in a well-characterized mouse model of a human lysosomal storage disease, <b>Sly</b> <b>disease.</b> Human <b>Sly</b> <b>disease</b> fibroblasts were reprogrammed into iPSCs, differentiated into a stable and expandable population of NSCs, genetically corrected with a transposon vector, and assessed for engraftment in NOD/SCID mice. Following neonatal intraventricular transplantation, the NSCs engraft along the rostrocaudal axis of the CNS primarily within white matter tracts and survive for at least 4  months. Genetically corrected iPSC-NSCs transplanted post-symptomatically into the striatum of adult <b>Sly</b> <b>disease</b> mice reversed neuropathology in a zone surrounding the grafts, while control mock-corrected grafts did not. The results demonstrate the potential for ex vivo gene therapy in the brain using human NSCs from autologous, non-neural tissues...|$|E
40|$|Strawberry lethal yellows (<b>SLY)</b> <b>disease</b> in Australia is {{associated}} with the phytoplasmas Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense and tomato big bud, and a rickettsia-like-organism (RLO). Ca. P. australiense is also associated with strawberry green petal (SGP) disease. This study investigated the strength of the association of the different agents with <b>SLY</b> <b>disease.</b> We also documented the location of SLY or SGP plants, and measured whether they were RLO or phytoplasma positive. Symptomatic strawberry plants collected from south-east Queensland (Australia) between January 2000 and October 2002 were screened by PCR for both phytoplasmas and the RLO. Two previously unreported disease symptoms termed severe fruit distortion (SFD) and strawberry leaves from fruit (SLF) were observed during this study but there was no clear association between these symptoms and phytoplasmas or the RLO. Only two SGP diseased plants were observed and collected, compared with 363 plants with <b>SLY</b> <b>disease</b> symptoms. Of the 363 SLY samples, 117 tested positive for the RLO, 67 tested positive for Ca. P. australiense AGY strain and 11 plants tested positive for Ca. P. australiense PYL variant strain. On runner production farms at Stanthorpe, Queensland the RLO was detected in SLY diseased plants more frequently than for the phytoplasmas. On fruit production farms on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Ca. P. australiense was detected in <b>SLY</b> <b>disease</b> plants more frequently than the RLO...|$|E
40|$|In Australia the {{strawberry}} diseases, lethal yellows and green petal, {{are associated with}} Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense (Ca. P. australiense). In addition, a rickettsia-like-organism (RLO) is associated with Australian strawberry lethal yellows (<b>SLY)</b> <b>disease.</b> Ca. P. australiense is also associated with the plant diseases, papaya dieback (PDB), Australian grapevine yellows (AGY) and Phormium yellow leaf (PYL; New Zealand). The tomato big bud (TBB) phytoplasma {{is associated with a}} wider range of plant diseases throughout Australia. In contrast, the RLO has only been identified in association with <b>SLY</b> <b>disease,</b> and Ca. P. australiense has only been detected in a limited number of plant host species. Diversity studies of phytoplasmas have shown that the conserved 16 S rRNA gene may not distinguish closely related phytoplasmas within the Ca. P. australiense group. Identification of more variable genes may facilitate the differentiation of these closely related phytoplasmas. The aims of this study were to; 1) develop a peR based diagnostic test for the SLY RLO, 2) use this and existing tests to examine the phloem limited organisms associated with strawberry green petal (SGP) and lethal yellows diseases, 3) measure the level of association between the RLOs and phytoplasmas, and strawberry diseases, 4) identify plant species that are possible reservoirs for the phytoplasmas and RLOs associated with SLY and SOP diseases, 5) identify new genes that may be suitable for differentiating closely related phytoplasmas, 6) use these genes and previously identified phytoplasma genes to investigate genetic variation among Ca. P. australiense strains and determine whether there is a relationship between strains and a particular host plant species. Two plants with <b>SLY</b> <b>disease</b> were subjected to PCR using papaya bunchy top (PBT) RLO primers and the amplicons were sequenced. Both amplicons shared 96 % sequence identity with the sdhA gene of the PBT RLO and this provided the first molecular evidence that an RLO is associated with strawberry lethal yellows. Only two plants with strawberry green petal disease were observed and collected between January 2000 and October 2002, compared with 363 plants with <b>SLY</b> <b>disease</b> symptoms. Of the 363 SLY samples, 117 tested positive for the RLO, 67 tested positive for Ca. P. australiense AGY strain and 11 plants tested positive for Ca. P. australiense Phormium yellow leaf variant strain. On runner production farms at Stanthorpe, the RLO was detected in SLY diseased plants more frequently than phytoplasmas. On fruit production farms at the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Ca. P. australiense was detected in <b>SLY</b> <b>disease</b> plants more frequently than the RLO. Thirty one other plant species from south-east Queensland were observed with disease between 2001 and 2003 and of these, 18 species tested positive using phytoplasma specific primers. The RLO was detected III diseased lacksonia scoparia and Modiola caroliniana samples collected at Stanthorpe. The TBB phytoplasma was detected in 16 different plant species and Ca. P. australiense AGY strain was detected in six species. The TBB phytoplasma was detected in plants collected at Nambour, Stanthorpe, Warwick and Brisbane. Ca. P. australiense was detected in plants collected at Nambour, Stanthorpe, Gatton and AHora. A TBB phytoplasma random clone genomic library was analysed as part of a search for new genes {{that could be used to}} distinguish closely related phytoplasmas. Twenty clones were analysed and these contained 26 genes comprising 19. 0 kbp of TBB phytoplasma genomic DNA. Half of the TBB phytoplasma genes identified were involved in DNA replication, transcription and translation. The remaining TBB phytoplasma genes were involved in protein secretion, cellular processes, transport and energy metabolism. Most primers designed based on the newly identified phytoplasma genes amplified a product from TBB and sweet potato little leaf strain V 4 (SPLL-V 4) phytoplasma samples. When amplified products were subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, the restriction patterns were the same as the respective clones. These primers did not amplify Ca. P. australiense DNA but sequence analysis of the tuf gene and rp gene operon showed that Ca. P. australiense strains could be differentiated into four subgroups. These subgroups were named 16 SrXII-BUuf-Australia I) (rp-A), 16 SrXII-BCtuf-New Zealand I; rp-B), 16 SrXII-B(tuf-New Zealand II) and 16 SrXII-B (rp-C). While no relationship was observed between these phytoplasma subgroups and collection date, location or host plant, the existence of subgroups indicated distinct inoculation events and possibly different alternative hosts and different vectors. PCR results and sequence analysis indicated the PBT RLO PCR primers are suitable for screening <b>SLY</b> <b>disease</b> samples for the presence of an RLO. peR screening of diseased strawberry plants showed RLOs and phytoplasmas are equally associated with <b>SLY</b> <b>disease</b> and the RLO is more prevalent at runner production areas while Ca. P. australiense is more frequently detected at fruit production farms. These findings suggest that RLO <b>SLY</b> <b>disease</b> management is required in the runner production areas while Ca. P. australiense control strategies should be implemented in fruit production areas. The TBB phytoplasma was most frequently detected in the other plant species collected during the study so there is a plentiful supply of TBB phytoplasma inoculum. Despite this, the TBB phytoplasma was infrequently detected in diseased strawberry plants. Six plant species were identified as possible sources of Ca. P. australiense inoculum for <b>SLY</b> <b>disease</b> while only two species are possible reservoirs for the SLY RLO. For <b>SLY</b> <b>disease</b> control strategies to be effective they will have to address the supply of inoculum in the areas surrounding strawberry farms...|$|E
40|$|The {{identity}} of phytoplasmas detected in strawberry plants with green petal (SGP) and lethal yellows (<b>SLY)</b> <b>diseases</b> {{was determined by}} RFLP analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene and adjacent spacer region (SR). RFLP and sequence comparisons indicated that the phytoplasmas associated with SGP and SLY were indistinguishable and were most closely related to 2 ̆ 7 Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense 2 ̆ 7, the phytoplasma associated with Australian grapevine yellows, papaya dieback and Phormium yellow leaf diseases. This taxon lies within the aster yellows strain cluster. Primers based on the phytoplasma tuf gene, which amplify only members of the AY strain cluster, amplified a DNA product from the SGP and SLY phytoplasmas. Primers deduced from the 16 S rRNA/SR of P. australiense that amplify only members of this taxon amplified rDNA sequences from the SGP and SLY phytoplasmas. Primers that selectively amplify members of the faba bean phyllody (FBP) phytoplasma group, the most commonly occurring phytoplasma group in Australia, did not amplify rDNA from the SGP and SLY phytoplasmas...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{detection}} of discordant inclusions in the brain of a 25 -week female fetus with a very rare lysosomal storage disease, namely, <b>Sly</b> <b>disease</b> (mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type VII), presenting with nonimmune hydrops fetalis. Besides vacuolated neurons, we found abundant deposition of polyglucosan bodies (PGBs) in the developing brain of this fetus in whom MPS-VII was corroborated by lysosomal beta-glucuronidase-deficiency detected in fetal blood and fetal skin-fibroblasts and {{by the presence of}} a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the GUSB gene in the mother. Fetal/neonatal metabolic disorders with PGB-deposition are extremely rare (particularly in relation to CNS involvement) and include almost exclusively subtypes of glycogenosis (types IV and VII). The accumulation of PGBs (particularly in the fetal brain) has so far not been depicted in <b>Sly</b> <b>disease.</b> This is the first report on such “aberrant” association. Besides, the detection of these CNS inclusions at such an early developmental stage is remarkably unique...|$|E
40|$|Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are {{inherited}} metabolic disorders {{from the}} group of lysosomal storage diseases (LSD). They arise from mutations causing dysfunction of one of enzymes involved in degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in lysosomes. Impaired degradation of these compounds results in their accumulation in cells and dysfunction of most tissues and organs of patients. If heparan sulfate (HS) is the sole or one of stored GAGs, brain functions are also affected. However, {{despite the fact that}} products of incomplete degradation of the same chemical, HS, are accumulated in brains of patients suffering from Hurler disease (MPS type I), Hunter disease (MPS type II), Sanfilippo disease (MPS type III) and <b>Sly</b> <b>disease</b> (MPS type VII), and obvious deterioration of brain functions occur in these patients, their behavior is considerably different between various types of MPS. Here we asked the question about biochemical reasons of these differences. We performed theoretical analysis of products of incomplete HS degradation that accumulate in tissues of patients diagnosed for these diseases. A correlation between chemical structures of incompletely degraded HS and behaviors of patients suffering from particular MPS types was found. We propose a hypothesis that particular chemical moieties occurring at the ends of incompletely degraded HS molecules may determine characteristic behavioral disturbances, perhaps due to chemical reactions interfering with functions of neurons in the brain. A possible experimental testing of this hypothesis is also proposed. If the hypothesis is true, it might shed some new light on biochemical mechanisms of behavioral problems occurring not only in MPS but also in some other diseases...|$|E
40|$|Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense (Ca. P. australiense) is {{associated}} with the plant diseases strawberry lethal yellows (SLY), strawberry green petal (SGP), papaya dieback (PDB), Australian grapevine yellows (AGY) and Phormium yellow leaf (PYL; New Zealand). Strawberry lethal yellows disease is also associated with a rickettsia-like-organism (RLO) or infrequently with the tomato big bud (TBB) phytoplasma, the latter being associated {{with a wide range of}} plant diseases throughout Australia. In contrast, the RLO has been identified only in association with <b>SLY</b> <b>disease,</b> and Ca. P. australiense has been detected only in a limited number of plant host species. The aim of this study was to identify plant hosts that are possible reservoirs of Ca. P. australiense and the SLY RLO. Thirty-one plant species from south-east Queensland were observed with disease between 2001 and 2003 and, of these, 18 species tested positive using phytoplasma-specific primers. The RLO was detected in diseased Jacksonia scoparia and Modiola caroliniana samples collected at Stanthorpe. The TBB phytoplasma was detected in 16 different plant species and Ca. P. australiense Australian grapevine yellows strain was detected in six species. The TBB phytoplasma was detected in plants collected at Nambour, Stanthorpe, Warwick and Brisbane. Ca. P. australiense was detected in plants collected at Nambour, Stanthorpe, Gatton and Allora. All four phytoplasmas were detected in diseased Gomphocarpus physocarpus plants collected at Toowoomba, Allora, Nambour and Gatton. These results indicated that the vector(s) of Ca. P. australiense are distributed throughout south-east Queensland and the diversity of phytoplasmas detected in G. physocarpus suggests it is a feeding source for phytoplasma insect vectors or it has a broad susceptibility to a range of phytoplasmas...|$|E
40|$|Diseases {{affecting}} {{the central nervous}} system (CNS) pose a formidable obstacle to the delivery of effective therapeutics. A tight-knit collection of cells and macromolecules known as the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) prevents most substances from entering the brain. One intriguing approach to overcoming this obstacle involves transplanting neural stem cells (NSCs), the precursor cells to neurons and glia in the brain, as vehicles for the delivery of therapeutic proteins in their native environment. Notably, this strategy has already been successfully applied to several lysosomal storage diseases caused by genetic deficiencies in one of the many lysosomal hydrolases expressed throughout the body. A major drawback to this approach is that foreign NSCs, e. g. immortalized cell lines and primary fetal NSCs can be tumorigenic and immunogenic. Recently developed induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies, combined with pluripotent stem cell differentiation techniques, have the potential to overcome these obstacles. This approach was evaluated using a comprehensive strategy targeting a prototypical lysosomal storage disease, <b>Sly</b> <b>disease</b> (MPS VII). MPS VII patient fibroblasts were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing the transcription factors Oct 4, Sox 2, Klf 4, and c-Myc. Patient fibroblasts were reprogrammed into embryonic stem cell-like iPSCs that demonstrated hallmarks of pluripotency. Patient iPSCs, alongside iPSCs derived from an unaffected individual, were subjected to a stepwise differentiation protocol, yielding a relatively homogenous population of NSCs. Following in vitro characterization, patient iPSCs were genetically corrected using a DNA transposon-based vector. Transplantation of NSCs into neonatal MPS VII mice revealed that these cells could migrate long distances and survive for several months. However, corrected grafts expressing physiological levels of the missing enzyme, ?-glucuronidase, were too sparse to significantly ameliorate pathology. In contrast, the same cells transplanted into the post-symptomatic adult MPS VII striatum were restricted to the injection site. Corrected, but not uncorrected patient iPSC-NSCs, were able to restore pathologically activated microglia to a normal quiescent state in a zone surrounding the graft. Together, these results provide evidence that ex vivo NSC gene therapy may be a viable option for many lysosomal storage diseases using easily attainable, non-neural patient tissue. ...|$|E
