25|$|Some {{drugs are}} {{approved}} by the FDA under subsection H, which has two <b>subparts.</b> The first sets forth ways to rush experimental drugs, such as aggressive HIV and cancer treatments, to market when speedy approval is deemed vital {{to the health of}} potential patients. The second part of subsection H applies to drugs that not only must meet restrictions for use due to safety requirements, but also are required to meet postmarketing surveillance to establish that the safety results shown in clinical trials are seconded by use in a much wider population. Mifepristone was approved under the second part of subsection H. The result is that women cannot pick the drug up at a pharmacy, but must now receive it directly from a doctor. Due to the possibility of adverse reactions such as excessive bleeding, which may require a blood transfusion, and incomplete abortion, which may require surgical intervention, the drug is only considered safe if a physician who is capable of administering a blood transfusion or a surgical abortion is available to the patient in the event of such emergencies. The approval of mifepristone under subsection H included a black box warning.|$|E

2500|$|One {{argument}} is that in most <b>subparts</b> and the general definition in the Internal Revenue Code defines [...] "state" [...] and [...] "United States," [...] are what other amending code sections refer to as [...] "a special definition of [...] "state"," [...] where the statutory definitions include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and some other territories, without mentioning the 50 states.
