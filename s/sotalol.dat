25|$|As a {{doctoral}} candidate at Oxford University, Bramah Singh determined that amiodarone and <b>sotalol</b> had antiarrhythmic properties and {{belonged to a}} new class of antiarrhythmic agents (what would become the class III antiarrhythmic agents). Today the mechanisms of action of amiodarone and <b>sotalol</b> have been investigated in more detail. Both drugs have been demonstrated to prolong the duration of the action potential, prolonging the refractory period, by interacting among other cellular function with K+ channels.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs that}} prolong the QT {{interval}} such as quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, <b>sotalol</b> and methadone may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce additive QT interval prolongation.|$|E
25|$|Primidone is not {{the only}} {{anticonvulsant}} used for essential tremor; the others include topiramate (Topamax) and gabapentin (Neurontin). Other pharmacological agents include alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), atenolol, <b>sotalol,</b> nadolol, clozapine, nimodipine, and botilinum toxin A. Many of these drugs were less effective (according to Table 1), but a few were not. Only propranolol has been compared to primidone in a clinical trial.|$|E
25|$|Hypothyroidism (slowing of the thyroid) occurs frequently; in the SAFE trial, which {{compared}} amiodarone {{with other}} medications {{for the treatment}} of atrial fibrillation, biochemical hypothyroidism (as defined by a TSH level of 4.5-10 mU/l) occurred in 25.8% of the amiodarone-treated group as opposed to 6.6% of the control group (taking placebo or <b>sotalol).</b> Overt hypothyroidism (defined as TSH >10 mU/l) occurred at 5.0% compared to 0.3%; most of these (>90%) were detected within {{the first six months of}} amiodarone treatment.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have also}} found that {{recognition}} memory involving epinephrine depends on a mechanism that depends on β adrenoceptors. Epinephrine does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, so its effects on memory consolidation are at least partly initiated by β adrenoceptors in the periphery. Studies have found that <b>sotalol,</b> a β adrenoceptor antagonist that also does not readily enter the brain, blocks the enhancing effects of peripherally administered epinephrine on memory. These findings suggest that β adrenoceptors are necessary for epinephrine {{to have an effect}} on memory consolidation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sotalol</b> is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} heart arrhythmias. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises that <b>sotalol</b> only be used for serious arrhythmias, because its prolongation of the QT interval carries a small risk of life-threatening torsade de pointes.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>sotalol</b> {{is removed}} from the body through the kidneys, it should not be used in people with a {{creatinine}} clearance rate below 40 mL/min. It is also excreted in breast milk, so mothers should not breastfeed while taking <b>sotalol.</b>|$|E
50|$|Class III agents include: bretylium, amiodarone, ibutilide, <b>sotalol,</b> dofetilide, and dronedarone.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sotalol</b> is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and AV re-entrant arrhythmias.|$|E
50|$|Agents include either cardioselectives such as {{acebutolol}} or metoprolol, or non-cardioselectives such as oxprenolol or <b>sotalol.</b>|$|E
50|$|According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), <b>sotalol</b> can be validly used to {{maintain}} normal heart rhythm {{in people with}} life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, or very symptomatic atrial fibrillation or flutter. Due {{to the risk of}} serious side effects, the FDA states that <b>sotalol</b> should generally be reserved for people whose ventricular arrhythmias are life-threatening, or whose fibrillation/flutter cannot be resolved using the Valsalva maneuver or another simple method.|$|E
50|$|SVT {{that does}} not involve the AV node may respond to other {{anti-arrhythmic}} drugs such as <b>sotalol</b> or amiodarone.|$|E
50|$|Trade {{names for}} <b>Sotalol</b> include Betapace and Betapace AF (Berlex Laboratories), Sotalex and Sotacor (Bristol-Myers Squibb), and Sotylize (Arbor Pharmaceuticals).|$|E

50|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that <b>sotalol</b> should be avoided {{in the setting of}} decreased ejection fraction due to an increased risk of death.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sotalol</b> was {{discovered}} in 1960, became widely used in the 1980s, and its function as an antiarrhythmic drug {{was discovered}} soon after.|$|E

50|$|Current {{treatment}} options for Boxer cardiomyopathy are largely {{restricted to the}} use of oral anti-arrhythmic medications. The aim of therapy is to minimize ventricular ectopy, eliminate syncopal episodes, and prevent sudden cardiac death. A number of medications have been used for this purpose, including atenolol, procainamide, <b>sotalol,</b> mexiletine, and amiodarone. Combinations can also be used. <b>Sotalol</b> is probably the most commonly used antiarrhythmic at this time. It has been demonstrated that <b>sotalol</b> alone, or a combination of mexiletine and atenolol, results in a reduction in the frequency and complexity of ventricular ectopy. It is likely that these medications also reduce syncopal episodes. However, the efficacy of any form of medical therapy in preventing sudden cardiac death is not known. Unfortunately, in some cases oral antiarrhythmic medications may be proarrhythmic, and can exacerbate the arrhythmia and syncopal episodes.|$|E
50|$|Other {{drugs that}} prolong the QT {{interval}} such as quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, <b>sotalol</b> and methadone may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce additive QT interval prolongation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sotalol</b> also acts on {{potassium}} {{channels and}} causes {{a delay in}} relaxation of the ventricles. By blocking these potassium channels, <b>sotalol</b> inhibits efflux of K+ ions, which results {{in an increase in}} the time before another electrical signal can be generated in ventricular myocytes. This increase in the period before a new signal for contraction is generated, helps to correct arrhythmias by reducing the potential for premature or abnormal contraction of the ventricles but also prolongs the frequency of ventricular contraction to help treat tachycardia.|$|E
50|$|In rare cases, the QT {{prolongation}} {{caused by}} <b>sotalol</b> {{can lead to}} the development of life-threatening torsade de pointes (TdP) ventricular tachycardia. Across several trials, 0.6% of oral <b>sotalol</b> patients with supraventricular arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation) developed TdP. For patients who had a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia (abnormal rhythm lasting more than 30 seconds), 4% developed TdP. Risk increases with dosage, female sex, or having a history of cardiomegaly or congestive heart failure. The incidence of TdP for sustained ventricular tachycardia patients was 0% with an 80 mg daily dose, 0.5% at 160 mg, 1.6% at 320 mg, 4.4% at 480 mg, 3.7% at 640 mg, and 5.8% at doses greater than 640 mg. Due to this risk, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires patients to be hospitalized for at least three days in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring upon starting or restarting <b>sotalol.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{those who}} are stable with a {{monomorphic}} waveform the medications procainamide or <b>sotalol</b> may be used and are better than lidocaine. Evidence does not show that amiodarone is better than procainamide.|$|E
50|$|Over 10% of oral <b>sotalol</b> users {{experience}} fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, weakness, nausea, {{shortness of}} breath, bradycardia (slow heart rate), palpitations, or chest pain. Risk {{for all of}} these effects increases with dosage.|$|E
50|$|Oxprenolol is a {{lipophilic}} {{beta blocker}} which passes the blood-brain barrier {{more easily than}} water-soluble beta blockers. As such, it {{is associated with a}} higher incidence of CNS-related side effects than hydrophilic ligands such as atenolol, <b>sotalol</b> and nadolol.|$|E
50|$|The {{antiarrhythmic}} {{effects of}} beta blockers arise from {{sympathetic nervous system}} blockade—resulting in depression of sinus node function and atrioventricular node conduction, and prolonged atrial refractory periods. <b>Sotalol,</b> in particular, has additional antiarrhythmic properties and prolongs action potential duration through potassium channel blockade.|$|E
50|$|Repolarization of the cardiomyocytes {{occurs in}} phases 1-3, and is caused {{predominantly}} by the outward movement of potassium ions. In Torsades de pointes, however, the repolarization is prolonged; {{this can be}} due to electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia), bradycardia, certain drugs (disopyramide, <b>sotalol,</b> amiodarone, amitriptyline, chlorpromazine, erythromycin) and/or congenital syndromes (LQT1-LQT4 gene defect).|$|E
50|$|<b>Sotalol,</b> a {{beta blocker}} and a class III {{antiarrhythmic}} agent, {{is the most}} effective antiarrhythmic agent in ARVD. Other antiarrhythmic agents used include amiodarone and conventional beta blockers (i.e.: metoprolol). If antiarrhythmic agents are used, their efficacy should be guided by series ambulatory holter monitoring, to show a reduction in arrhythmic events.|$|E
50|$|Class III agents (prolong repolarization by {{blocking}} outward K+ current): amiodarone and <b>sotalol</b> are effective class III agents. Ibutilide is another Class III agent {{but has a}} different mechanism of action (acts to promote influx of sodium through slow-sodium channels). It {{has been shown to}} be effective in acute cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sotalol</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1960 by A. A. Larsen of Mead-Johnson Pharmaceutical. It was originally recognized for its antihypertensive and antianginal effects. It was made {{available in the}} United Kingdom and France in 1974, Germany in 1975, and Sweden in 1979. In the 1980s, its antiarrhythmic properties were discovered. The United States approved the drug in 1992.|$|E
50|$|Primidone is not {{the only}} {{anticonvulsant}} used for essential tremor; the others include topiramate (Topamax) and gabapentin (Neurontin). Other pharmacological agents include alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), atenolol, <b>sotalol,</b> nadolol, clozapine, nimodipine, and botilinum toxin A. Many of these drugs were less effective (according to Table 1), but a few were not. Only propranolol has been compared to primidone in a clinical trial.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>sotalol</b> prolongs the QT interval, the FDA {{recommends}} {{against using}} it {{in conjunction with other}} drugs that prolong QT interval. Studies have found serious side effects to be more common in patients also taking digoxin, possibly because of pre-existing heart failure in those patients. As with other beta blockers, it may interact with calcium channel blockers, catecholamine-depleting drugs, insulin or antidiabetic drugs, beta2-adrenergic agonists, and Clonidine.|$|E
50|$|Drug-induced QT {{prolongation}} {{is usually}} a result of treatment by antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone and <b>sotalol</b> or {{a number of other}} drugs that have been reported to cause this problem (e.g., cisapride). Some antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol and ziprasidone, have a prolonged QT interval as a rare side effect. Genetic mutations may make one more susceptible to drug-induced LQT. The antidepressant citalopram is also associated with an increased risk of long QT syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|Related to mesylate, is the mesyl, an {{abbreviation}} for methanesulfonyl or CH3SO2 (Ms) functional group. For example, methanesulfonyl chloride {{is often referred}} to as mesyl chloride. Whereas mesylates are often hydrolytically labile, mesyl groups, when attached to nitrogen are robust with respect to hydrolysis. [...] This functional group appears in a variety of medications, particularly cardiac (i.e. “antiarrhythmic”) but as sulfonamide moiety. Examples include <b>Sotalol,</b> ibutilide, sematilide, Dronedarone, Dofetilide, E-4031, and Bitopertin [...]|$|E
50|$|According to the FDA, <b>sotalol</b> {{should not}} be used in people with a waking heart rate lower than 50 beats per minute. It {{should not be}} used in people with sick sinus syndrome, long QT syndrome, {{cardiogenic}} shock, uncontrolled heart failure, bronchial asthma or a related bronchospastic condition, or people with serum potassium below 4 meq/L. It should only be used in people with a second and third degree AV block if a functioning pacemaker is present.|$|E
