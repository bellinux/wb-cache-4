40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to obtain an insight into various secondary braking systems for goods vehicles. Practical tests were carried out with a tractor- semi-trailer combination. The performance of various split braking systems as well as <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> <b>actuators</b> are shown. With {{nearly all of the}} secondary braking systems it is possible to obtain sufficient deceleration to meet legal requirements for the braking path. The critical point however is lateral stability. The report concludes with recommendations for legal requirements concerning lateral stability both on dry and on wet road surfaces. It is concluded that: lateral stability must be obtained on both a dry and a wet road surface; tractors for semi-trailers should have a split braking system; and service brakes for motor vehicles and trailers (semi-trailers) should have a certain braking capacity in case a failure occurs (emergency braking capacity). As a solution it is proposed that the emergency braking capacity of the service brake shall be at least 50 % of the normal required capacity...|$|R

50|$|A <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> {{relay valve}} {{works on the}} same {{principle}} as the service brake relay valve, although it has the opposite effect. This type of relay valve responds to a major drop in pressure at its control-port by opening its exhaust port, which causes the air from each <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> chamber under its control to remotely exhaust, thus applying the <b>spring</b> <b>brakes</b> much-more-quickly than would otherwise be possible if the air were required to discharge via the yellow parking-control valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs is fed into the supply-port of the parking-control valve, {{as well as the}} supply-port of this relay valve; it is merged via yet another two-way check valve. The delivery-port output of the parking-control valve connects to the control-port of this relay valve; this enables the <b>spring</b> <b>brakes</b> to be controlled via this valve. The merged air from the parking-control valve prevents air-loss from only one braking circuit from causing the <b>spring</b> <b>brakes</b> to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location. However, with this increased control, comes increased responsibility {{on the part of the}} driver: If air is lost from the primary circuit alone, the <b>spring</b> <b>brakes</b> must be manually applied by the driver via the parking-control valve; otherwise, the front service brakes may not be enough to stop the vehicle safely in an emergency—especially if the vehicle is heavily loaded, and/or traveling at a high-speed. In fact, the driver's failure to manually apply the <b>spring</b> <b>brakes</b> in this situation could lead to catastrophic failure of the front brakes due to overheating, since it could cause the front service brakes to exceed their design-limit for energy absorption.QR1C air valve speeds up the process, with anti compounding, meaning trailer and service brakes will function 1 second between each other.The relay valve's function is analogous to the transistor used in electronic circuits.|$|R
40|$|Environment {{and fire}} risks {{together}} with high maintenance costs generate the main drive {{in recent years}} to replace hydraulic actuators in aircrafts by electromechanical actuators. However, conventional electromagnetic motors with reduction gears increase the weight of the drive train and require high electrical peak power due to the kinetic energy of the drive train during anti-skid operation. Thus, actuators with high torque or force at low speed and very low inertia are needed.

To enhance the vehicle stabilisation and performances, the steering actuator can be activated and suspensions control can be set to road handling with the same scheduling parameter, in an LPV strategy, according to dangerousness of the situation.

The simulation results show that the proposed simulation method and actuator with appropriate controller strategy have similar behaviour to a hydraulic brake in terms of its capability to produce the desired braking force to reduce the speed and halt the vehicle.

50|$|In trailers, {{this remote}} air-supply {{is in the}} form of a tank, which is charged {{whenever}} the emergency brakes are released via the red trailer-supply valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, this tank actually receives its air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs of the tractor; the air from both of these reservoirs is merged via a two-way check valve. The two-way check valve is a pneumatic device that has two inputs and one output; each input is connected to one these reservoirs. Only the air that is at the higher pressure is allowed to pass through to the check valve's output, which then passes through the tractor-protection valve, and then travels onward towards the trailer's air-tank and <b>spring</b> <b>brake</b> valve via the red trailer-supply line (a.k.a., the emergency line); this releases the trailer's emergency <b>brakes</b> (a.k.a. <b>spring</b> <b>brakes).</b> The tractor-protection valve is a device that prevents air from being lost from the tractor's braking system in the event of the air-lines becoming separated or broken. The tractor's air-lines connect to the trailer's air-lines via metal connectors known as gladhands. The merged air from both reservoirs of the tractor prevents air-loss from only one tractor braking circuit from causing the trailer's <b>spring</b> <b>brakes</b> to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location, such as in the middle of an intersection.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAutomotive light {{vehicles}} are complex systems involving many different dynamics. On one side, vertical, roll and pitch behaviours are often related to comfort performances (indeed, roll is also linked to safety characteristics [23]). On the other hand, safety performances are mainly {{characterized by the}} longitudinal, lateral and yaw dynamics [38, 14]. In practice, these two behaviours are often treated in a decoupled may (the first dynamics are often related to suspensions systems while the second one to steering and braking systems). This chapter focuses on the safety problem, and more specifically, on lateral and yaw dynamics. It presents two close techniques to design robust gain-scheduled H∞ MIMO VDSC (Vehicle Dynamic Stability Controller), involving both steering and rear <b>braking</b> <b>actuators.</b> Both approaches aim at restoring the yaw rate of the vehicle {{as close as possible}} to the nominal motion expected by the driver. The specific framework of each of that approaches is given below. First, a methodology allowing to synthesize such a controller while taking into account the <b>braking</b> <b>actuator</b> limitations and use the steering actuator only if it is necessary, is presented. The proposed solution is coupled with a local ABS strategy to guarantee slip stability and make the solution complete. The originality relies on the LPV formulation of the saturation-like function of the allowable braking force directly during the synthesis step. Secondly, the control design methodology aims at using the steering action to control the yaw rate and at limiting the use of the <b>braking</b> <b>actuator</b> only when the vehicle goes toward instability. Judging the vehicle stability region is done from the phase-plane of the side-slip angle and its time derivative, which is used to monitor the car dynamical behaviour. These controllers are both treated in an original way by the synthesis of a parameter dependent controller built in the LPV framework and by the solution of an LMI problem. Nonlinear time and frequency domain simulations, performed on a complex full vehicle model (which has been validated on a real car), subject to critical driving situations, show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed solutions...|$|R

40|$|Heavy goods {{vehicles}} exhibit poor {{braking performance}} in emergency situations {{when compared to}} other vehicles. Part of the problem is caused by sluggish pneumatic <b>brake</b> <b>actuators,</b> which limit the control bandwidth of their antilock braking systems. In addition, heuristic control algorithms are used that do not achieve the maximum braking force throughout the stop. In this article, a novel braking system is introduced for pneumatically braked heavy goods vehicles. The conventional <b>brake</b> <b>actuators</b> are improved by placing high-bandwidth, binary-actuated valves directly on the brake chambers. A made-for-purpose valve is described. It achieves a switching delay of 3 – 4 [*]ms in tests, which is an order of magnitude faster than solenoids in conventional anti-lock braking systems. The heuristic braking control algorithms are replaced with a wheel slip regulator based on sliding mode control. The combined actuator and slip controller are shown to reduce stopping distances on smooth and rough, high friction (μ[*]=[*] 0. 9) surfaces by 10 % and 27 % respectively in hardware-in-the-loop tests compared with conventional ABS. On smooth and rough, low friction (μ[*]=[*] 0. 2) surfaces, stopping distances are reduced by 23 % and 25 %, respectively. Moreover, the overall air reservoir size required on a heavy goods vehicle is governed by its air usage during an anti-lock braking stop on a low friction, smooth surface. The 37 % reduction in air usage observed in hardware-in-the-loop tests on this surface therefore represents the potential reduction in reservoir size that could be achieved by the new system...|$|R

The disaster that destroyed Columbia occurred on its 28 th flight, February 1, 2003, nearly 22 years after its first launch. In order to minimize risk of losing another Space Shuttle, a probabilistic life and reliability analysis was conducted for the Space Shuttle rudder/speed <b>brake</b> <b>actuators</b> to determine the number of flights the actuators could sustain.
