5|$|After {{leaving the}} Navy in September 1945, Green {{worked for the}} Fine Art Society. In March 1946, Carter writes, he failed the {{entrance}} exam for the University of London, then worked for Selfridges and the civil service, and as a storeman for Ealing Borough Council. On two occasions he had lost jobs, he <b>said,</b> <b>because</b> he had refused to be dishonest. In 1962 he held {{a job with the}} post office, then worked as a self-employed gardener until 1968 when he began his anti-protein campaign. He lived with his parents until they died, his father in 1966 and his mother the following year, after which he was given a council flat in Haydock Green, Northolt, north London.|$|E
25|$|His affectionate {{nickname}} was 'Noddy', not, {{as often}} <b>said,</b> <b>because,</b> {{once he was}} out, {{he was known to}} sleep often in the dressing room, but because he was once discovered watching the children's programme there.|$|E
25|$|Also, the IRS spent a {{total of}} USD $32.3 million to improve IRS {{building}} security across the United States, with USD $30.5 million for more security guards. The IRS <b>said,</b> <b>because</b> of the 2010 Austin terrorist attack and the emergency plans in place, there was no direct budgetary impact on the IRS’s ability to provide taxpayer services or enforce tax laws.|$|E

25|$|Innes was {{involved}} in virtually every significant act in Cape political life during {{his years as a}} parliamentarian, and his alliance with Merriman and Sauer was a formidable one. Yet he was not particularly well suited to politics; he was too scrupulous and too measured in his views. He turned down the leadership of the opposition, he <b>said,</b> <b>because</b> his tendency to see both sides of a debate would make him a poor leader.|$|E
25|$|In the aftermaths of the Ganlu Incident, Li Shi and Zheng Tan {{were made}} chancellors, and {{while most of}} the power {{remained}} in the leading eunuchs' hands, it was <b>said</b> <b>because</b> of a severely worded petition filed by the military governor Liu Congjian objecting to the deaths of Wang Ya and Jia, the powerful eunuchs began to show some restraint, allowing Emperor Wenzong and the chancellors to have some ability to govern. Meanwhile, Li Zongmin was moved closer to the capital, to be the military advisor to the prefect of Heng Prefecture (modern Hengyang in Hunan). Henceforth, the officials accused of being partisans of Li Zongmin and Li Deyu were beginning to be allowed to move toward the capital.|$|E
25|$|At the Royal Rumble, AJ Styles {{lost the}} WWE Championship to John Cena. Styles was {{immediately}} {{entered into the}} WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, but SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon also promised Styles {{that he would get}} a one-on-one rematch for the title if he did not win the title back at the pay-per-view. At Elimination Chamber, Bray Wyatt eliminated both Cena and Styles to win the championship. Cena then immediately invoked his rematch clause, but Styles intervened, stating he should get his first. SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan then scheduled a triple threat match for the WWE Championship, where Wyatt retained. Randy Orton then refused his right as the Royal Rumble winner to face Wyatt for the title at WrestleMania 33, so Bryan scheduled a 10-man battle royal to determine a new number one-contender. Styles was entered into the battle royal, which ended in a draw between him and Luke Harper. The two faced each other in a number one contender's match the following week. Styles pinned Harper, but the referee did not see Harper's foot on the rope. Shane came out and restarted the match, which angered Styles, even though he would defeat Harper once again. At the conclusion of the show, Orton reclaimed his right to face Wyatt at WrestleMania. Bryan and Shane decided that Styles would have to compete in another number one contender's match, this time against Orton, who won. After the show, an angered Styles got into a heated argument backstage with Shane. The following week, an irate Styles said that he was tired of Bryan and Shane. He <b>said</b> <b>because</b> of them, {{he did not have a}} match at WrestleMania, but Orton, who committed arson, did. Later backstage, Styles attacked Shane and threw him through a car window. Styles was subsequently (kayfabe) fired by Bryan, but at the end of the show, an injured Shane challenged Styles to a match at WrestleMania, which Styles accepted. At the end of the following week's episode, Shane called out Styles and the two brawled, which ended with Shane performing a Leap of Faith on Styles through the broadcast table. The following week, the two had a contract signing to make the match official and the two traded barbs.|$|E

500|$|Cavanagh also {{considered}} this game {{an opportunity to}} indulge in his [...] "retro fetish". [...] He has <b>said</b> <b>because</b> he lacks the technical prowess to make more modern-looking games, he instead focuses on making them visually interesting; additionally, he finds this to be made easier by [...] "work within narrow limits". VVVVVV was the first game which Cavanagh sold commercially. [...] While his previous games were all released as freeware, due {{to the size of}} VVVVVV compared to his previous work, Cavanagh felt that he [...] "couldn't see [...] going down that route." ...|$|E
500|$|Wolfe {{believed}} {{that if he had}} written the episode later in the series he would have concentrated more on the established characters and less on Q and Vash. De Lancie felt that the episode never explained Q's motivation for wanting to stay with Vash. [...] "I think Q is best used when he deals with large philosophical issues, and skirt chasing just isn't one of them", he <b>said.</b> <b>Because</b> certain aspects of Q's character are left unexplored, De Lancie found that [...] "the style, the quips and the panache in which things are done become very important".|$|E
500|$|During Goodwin's work on Team of Rivals, a {{plagiarism}} scandal erupted over unmarked quotations in Goodwin's 1987 book The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys. Goodwin {{stated that}} {{in dealing with}} the scandal, during which she had to apologize and make an out-of-court settlement to author Lynne McTaggart, she found Lincoln a consolation, particularly his philosophy [...] "not to waste precious energies on recriminations about the past". In a 2012 interview, Goodwin cited early 20th-century muckraker Ida Tarbell on the pleasures of writing about Lincoln: [...] "Somebody asked her, why do so many people write about Lincoln? And she <b>said,</b> <b>because</b> he’s so companionable. And I think somehow that's been true for me." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} shot over 15 days in Los Angeles and Malibu, California. Swanberg and cinematographer Ben Richardson decided to shoot on 35 mm film rather than digitally, {{as most of}} Swanberg's {{previous}} films had been made. They decided to shoot on film, Richardson <b>said,</b> <b>because</b> [...] "there is a certain visual integrity to a film-derived image that is still lacking for me {{in most of the}} digitally-derived imagery that we see". Although the film's dialogue was improvised, the actors rehearsed each scene before filming so that the scene could be blocked out due to the constraints of working with film rather than digital.|$|E
500|$|The defence {{maintained}} that the witnesses who said Bamber disliked his family were lying or had misinterpreted his words. Mugford had lied about Bamber's confession, they <b>said,</b> <b>because</b> he had betrayed her, {{and she wanted to}} stop him from being with anyone else. No one had seen Bamber cycle to and from the farm. There were no marks on him on the night that suggested he had been in a fight. No blood-stained clothing of his was recovered. He had not driven to the farm as quickly as he could have after his father telephoned because he was afraid. There was no probative value in the finding of a hacksaw in the garden, because Bamber had entered the house via the windows many times, before the killing and since.|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, cancer {{survivor}} Cathy Bossi, an on-duty flight attendant for U.S. Airways, was passing through security screening at Charlotte Douglas International Airport {{on the way}} to her next flight. Due to the radiation involved, she reluctantly passed through a full-body scanner. [...] "The T.S.A. Agent told me to put my I.D. on my back," [...] she said. [...] "When I got out of there the agent <b>said</b> <b>because</b> my I.D. was on my back, I had to go to a personal screening area." [...] During what she described as an [...] "aggressive" [...] pat-down search, security screening personnel forced her to remove and show her prosthetic breast. Their action violated TSA guidelines, which state that agents do not need to touch or inspect a mastectomy prosthetic.|$|E

500|$|Of the 12.4 million total viewings of [...] "Fun Run", {{the fourth}} season's premiere, 2.7 million, or 22%, {{were on a}} {{computer}} via online streaming. [...] "The Office," [...] said The New York Times, [...] "is {{on the leading edge}} of a sharp shift in entertainment viewing that was thought to be years away: watching television episodes on a computer screen is now a common activity for millions of consumers." [...] It was particularly popular with online viewers, an NBC researcher <b>said,</b> <b>because</b> as an episode-driven sitcom without special effects it was easy to watch on smaller monitors such as those found on laptops and iPods. Between the online viewings and those who use digital video recorders, 25–50% of the show's viewers watch it after its scheduled airtime.|$|E
500|$|The soundtracks of Eega and Naan Ee, each {{consisting}} of five songsone {{of which is}} a remixed version of the film's title song—were composed by M. M. Keeravani. Keeravani <b>said</b> <b>because</b> the film's theme of revenge and the protagonist (a housefly) are universal concepts, his [...] "only challenge" [...] was ensuring the music did not have a [...] "distinct ethnic or regional flavour" [...] and [...] "appeal". He incorporated the buzzing sound made by flies into the score and exaggerated or reduced it according to a scene's emotional nature. Rajamouli approached Madhan Karky to write the lyrics for Naan Ee soundtrack after the release of Enthiran (2010), explaining the importance of each song in the film's narrative. As well as providing detailed profiles of the characters, Rajamouli enacted a few scenes, which helped Karky write the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|The {{author was}} further {{prompted}} {{to write about}} grace when a friend told him about encountering a homeless prostitute in Chicago who began to cry as {{she told him that}} she had raised money for drugs by prostituting her two-year-old child. When Yancey's friend asked the woman if she had sought help at a local church, she answered, [...] "Church? Why would I ever go there? I was already feeling terrible about myself. They'd just make me feel worse." [...] This story convinced Yancey that Christians are doing a poor job of communicating the message that God is willing to accept people, regardless of what they have done; the story haunted him, he <b>said,</b> <b>because</b> the woman was [...] "the type of person who would have gone to Jesus. The more unrighteous a person was, the more comfortable they felt around Jesus".|$|E
500|$|Walker {{described}} {{his voice to}} CMT as [...] "raspy [...] rugged." [...] He cites George Jones (also a Beaumont native) as a primary influence, as well as James Taylor and Bob Seger; he has also <b>said</b> that, <b>because</b> {{he grew up in}} a largely African-American neighborhood, his singing style was influenced by rhythm and blues music. In addition, he said that after his diagnosis, he realized that [...] "you need to love your family" [...] and <b>said</b> that, <b>because</b> he considered his songs positive in nature, he felt that he could connect to younger listeners.|$|R

500|$|The band became {{associated}} with the International Space Year (ISY), designated as 1992 by the United Nations to promote peaceful and collaborative space exploration, when Linnell and Flansburgh were searching the NASA Archive Center for appropriate photographs and visual materials for the album artwork. Staff members at the NASA facility took notice of the duo and inquired about their research. Linnell responded that they [...] "were in this band, we're making this record, and we're going to start touring next year...They were particularly interested in that, because they said that 1992 was ISY. It {{was the first time}} we ever heard of that, but they <b>said</b> <b>because</b> we were a band going to be touring around the world in 1992 they wondered if we wanted to be spokesband for the ISY. So we said why not?" ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002 Schapira interviewed three {{anonymous}} Israeli soldiers, [...] "Ariel, Alexej and Idan," [...] {{who said}} they had been on duty at the IDF post that day. They knew something was about to happen, one <b>said,</b> <b>because</b> of the camera crews that had gathered. One soldier said the live fire started from the high-rise Palestinian blocks known as [...] "the twins"; the shooter was firing at the IDF post, he said. The soldier added that he had not seen the al-Durrahs. The Israelis returned fire on a Palestinian station 30 metres {{to the left of the}} al-Durrahs. Their weapons were equipped with optics that allowed them to fire accurately, according to the soldier, and none of them had switched to automatic fire. In the view of the soldier, the shooting of Jamal and Muhammad was no accident. The shots did not come from the Israeli position, he said.|$|E
500|$|Julia Pistor, the film's co-producer, {{said that}} {{although}} Nickelodeon (which owns the SpongeBob trademark) wanted to sell character-themed backpacks, lunch boxes and wristwatches it respected Hillenburg's integrity and gave him control of merchandising. Hillenburg {{had no problem with}} candy and ice cream tie-ins, Pistor <b>said</b> (<b>because</b> of the treats' simplicity), but he had issues with fast food tie-ins; according to him, the latter was [...] "full of hidden additives." [...] Pistor said, [...] "The trouble is that you can't go out with animated films without a fast-food tie-in People don't take you seriously." [...] Hillenburg replied, [...] "Yeah, well, my take on that is that we shouldn't do that We didn't want to suddenly become the people serving up food that's not that good for you - especially kids. We work with Burger King, and they make toys and watches. But to actually take the step of pushing the food, that's crossing the line. I don't want to be the Pied Piper of fast food." ...|$|E
