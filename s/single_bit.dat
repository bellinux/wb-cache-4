25|$|A unibit (often {{called a}} step drill bit) is a roughly conical bit with a stairstep profile. Due to its design, a <b>single</b> <b>bit</b> {{can be used}} for {{drilling}} a wide range of hole sizes. Some bits come to a point and are thus self-starting. The larger-size bits have blunt tips and are used for hole enlarging.|$|E

25|$|Without error {{correcting}} codes, {{digital audio}} {{would not be}} technically feasible. The Reed–Solomon codes can correct a corrupted symbol with a <b>single</b> <b>bit</b> error just as easily as it can correct a symbol with all bits wrong. This makes the RS codes particularly suitable for correcting burst errors. By far, the most common application of RS codes is in compact discs. In addition to basic error correction provided by RS codes, protection against burst errors due to scratches on the disc is provided by a cross interleaver.|$|E
25|$|All <b>single</b> <b>bit</b> errors {{within the}} bitfilter period {{mentioned}} above (for even {{terms in the}} generator polynomial) can be identified uniquely by their residual. So CRC method {{can be used to}} correct single-bit errors as well (within those limits, e.g. 32767 bits with optimal generator polynomials of degree 16). Since all odd errors leave an odd residual, all even an even residual, 1-bit errors and 2-bit errors can be distinguished. However, like other SECDED techniques, CRCs cannot always distinguish between 1-bit errors and 3-bit errors. When 3 or more bit errors occur in a block, CRC bit error correction will be erroneous itself and produce more errors.|$|E
25|$|Since every {{reduction}} from a set B {{to a set}} A has {{to determine}} whether a single element is in A in only finitely many steps, it can only make finitely many queries of membership in the set B. When the amount of information about the set B used to compute a <b>single</b> <b>bit</b> of A is discussed, this is made precise by the use function. Formally, the use of a reduction is the function that sends each natural number n to the largest natural number m whose membership in the set B was queried by the reduction while determining the membership of n in A.|$|E

25|$|The {{header section}} {{contains}} the following fields: Identification, Flags, Number of questions, Number of answers, Number of authority resource records (RRs), and Number of additional RRs. The identification field {{can be used}} to match responses with queries. The flag field consists of several sub-fields. The first is a <b>single</b> <b>bit</b> which indicates if the message is a query (0) or a reply (1). The second sub-field consists of four bits; if the value is 1, the present packet is a reply; if it is 2, the present packet is a status; if the value is 0, the present packet is a request. A single-bit sub-field indicates if the DNS server is authoritative for the queried hostname. Another single-bit sub-field indicates if the client wants to send a recursive query ("RD"). The next single-bit sub-field indicates if the replying DNS server supports recursion ("RA"), since not all DNS servers are configured to do this task. Another sub-field indicates if the request was truncated for some reason ("TC"), and a four-bit sub-field indicates status. The question section contains the domain name and type of record (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.) being resolved. The domain name is broken into discrete labels which are concatenated; each label is prefixed by the length of that label. The answer section has the resource records of the queried name. A domain name may occur in multiple records if it has multiple IP addresses associated.|$|E

One notable instance of their use was during the Spanish Armada, when a beacon chain relayed a signal from Plymouth to London.|$|E
50|$|Write {{combining}} (WC) is {{a computer}} bus technique for allowing data to be combined and temporarily stored in a buffer — the write combine buffer (WCB) — to be released together later in burst mode instead of writing (immediately) as <b>single</b> <b>bits</b> or small chunks.|$|R

500|$|Kilburn's wartime work {{inspired}} {{his enthusiasm}} for some form of electronic computer. The principal technical barrier to such a development {{at that time was}} the lack of any practical means of storage for data and instructions. In July 1946, Kilburn and Williams collaboratively developed a storage device based on a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) called the Williams-Kilburn tube. A patent was filed in 1946. Initially they used it to store a <b>single</b> <b>bit.</b> The CRT image soon faded, so they devised a scheme by which it was read and refreshed continually, effectively making the data storage permanent. By December 1947, they were able to store 2,048 bits on one [...] diameter CRT.|$|E

They have all the backpacks on, they have all the belts on, every <b>single</b> <b>bit</b> of armor is there, and they're carrying around lots of armor. At the end of the war, they've lost it all and just carry what they need. This is all they have. So if you look at our Spartans, they have more pieces of armor on going into the war. They have more markings on there, more pieces of armor. They've still got the belts on, they're still carrying around everything.|$|E
500|$|Although Hamming {{had been}} hired to work on {{elasticity}} theory, he still {{spent much of his}} time with the calculating machines. Before he went home on one Friday in 1947, he set the machines to perform a long and complex series of calculations over the weekend, only to find when he arrived on Monday morning that an error had occurred early in the process and the calculation had errored off. Digital machines manipulated information as sequences of zeroes and ones, units of information that Tukey would christen [...] "bits". If a <b>single</b> <b>bit</b> in a sequence was wrong, then the whole sequence would be. To detect this, a parity bit was used to verify the correctness of each sequence.

500|$|Memory cells (blue squares in the illustration) {{are further}} {{organized}} into matrices and addressed through rows and columns.

[...] Consequently, read operations are of a destructive nature because the design of DRAM requires memory cells to be rewritten after their values have been read by transferring the cell charges into the row buffer.
