40|$|Abstract. A typical {{mechanical}} {{character of}} rock {{is that the}} tensile strength is {{far less than the}} compressive strength. Meanwhile, the test data of tensile strength is very dispersive. Because the direct tensile tests always result in failure due to the difficulty in clamping the rock sample, the <b>splitting</b> <b>test</b> is used to determine the tensile strength of rock. There are four kinds of loading modes in the <b>splitting</b> <b>test</b> in actual laboratory test: angle pad splitting, round pad splitting, aclinic loading platen splitting, arc loading platen splitting. In this paper, the direct tensile <b>test,</b> the <b>splitting</b> <b>test</b> and the influence of different loading modes on rock tensile strength were studied. In order to study the stress distribution, the progressive splitting failure process was numerically modeled under the four kinds of loading cases by the Realistic Failure Process Analysis code (RFPA 2 D). Results show that the stress states under angle pad splitting, round pad splitting are similar to the stress states under diametrical compressive state. Regarding that the round pad <b>splitting</b> <b>test</b> is easy to implement, and its numerical results are also stable relatively, the round pad loading mode was suggested to be adopted...|$|R

Compared with the traditional method of Hough forests, the proposed method can extract more information. Furthermore, this method introduces the LBP feature into Hough forests and then captures both edge-based shape structure and texture information. The proposed method is validated through the experiments on a set of publicly available benchmark dataset.

40|$|The <b>splitting</b> tensile <b>test</b> {{is a much}} used {{method to}} {{determine}} the tensile strength of concrete. The conventional test procedure {{is known to have}} a number of limitations related to size effect and boundary conditions. Furthermore, it has been reported to be impossible to determine the tensile strength of Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC) using the standard <b>splitting</b> tensile <b>test</b> method. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a methodology to obtain a close estimate of the true tensile strength of FRC from an adjusted tensile <b>splitting</b> <b>test</b> procedure. <b>Splitting</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on cylindrical specimens of four FRC mixes. The transversal deformation perpendicular to the load direction was recorded during the tests. The experimental load-deformation curves thus obtained have two peaks, an initial one as a result of the tensile stresses at the centre of the specimen and a second peak due to secondary cracking outside the loading axis. The tensile strength can be calculated from the first peak which represents the elastic limit state for the material. The method is validated through numerical simulation of the <b>splitting</b> <b>tests</b> using a cohesive crack approach. It is concluded that it is possible to obtain a close estimate of the true tensile strength of FRC using the procedure developed in the paper. [URL]...|$|R
