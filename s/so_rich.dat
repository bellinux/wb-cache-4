25|$|The {{growth of}} Guanajuato {{resulted}} from the abundantly available minerals in the mountains surrounding it. The mines were <b>so</b> <b>rich</b> {{that the city was}} one of the most influential during the colonial period. One of the mines, La Valenciana, accounted for two-thirds of the world’s silver production at the height of its production.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{had been}} done in this area long before the Spanish arrived. Late in the pre-Hispanic period the Aztecs had a {{presence}} here, specifically to look for metals to make ornamental objects for their political and religious elite. Some stories from this time state that the area was <b>so</b> <b>rich</b> in minerals that nuggets of gold could be picked up from the ground.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{noting the}} obvious {{relevance}} {{of this to}} their own proposed scenario Marlovians do not seek multiple parallels between Marlowe's known or predicted life and these stories, believing that the plays are <b>so</b> <b>rich</b> in plot devices that such parallels can be found with numerous individuals.

25|$|The {{analytical}} Marxists, however, largely rejected {{this point}} of view. Led by G. A. Cohen (a moral philosopher by training), they argued that a Marxist theory of justice had to focus on egalitarianism. For Cohen, this meant an engagement with moral and political philosophy in order to demonstrate the injustice of market exchange, {{and the construction of}} an appropriate egalitarian metric. This argument is pursued in Cohen's books, Self-Ownership, Freedom and Equality (1995) and If You're an Egalitarian How Come You're <b>So</b> <b>Rich?</b> (2000b).|$|E

25|$|Although {{the beach}} {{promenade}} {{was created in}} 1884, the sandy shore has been mentioned in the literature much earlier. The beach shore has a mentioning in the verse no. 2297 of the 4000 Divya Prabandham written by Peyalwar. The verse, dating back to 7th century AD, was written in Tamil, and it says that the sea was <b>so</b> <b>rich</b> with white waves bringing to the shore very precious gems like red corals and white pearls and that {{the light of the}} dusk (moonlight) falls on these gems at the shore and makes the area brightened with beautiful colours.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the things}} the movie does best is {{transport}} you back in time and into nature. In the early scenes as Joel leaves his aunt's home to travel across the South by rickety bus and horse and carriage, you feel the strangeness, wonder and anxiety of a child abandoning everything that's familiar to go to a place so remote he has to ask directions along the way. The landscape over which he travels is <b>so</b> <b>rich</b> and fertile that you can almost smell the earth and sky. Later on, when Joel tussles with Idabell (Aubrey Dollar), a tomboyish neighbor who becomes his best friend (a character inspired by the author Harper Lee), the movie has a special force and clarity in its evocation of the physical immediacy of being a child playing outdoors.|$|E
25|$|For a {{long time}} the city and country was the central seat of the dualistic Zoroastrian religion, the founder of which, Zoroaster, died within the walls {{according}} to the Persian poet Firdowsi. Armenian sources state that the Arsacid Dynasty of the Parthian Empire established its capital in Balkh. There is a long-standing tradition that an ancient shrine of Anahita was to be found here, a temple <b>so</b> <b>rich</b> it invited plunder. Alexander the Great married Roxana of Bactria after killing the king of Balkh. The city was {{the capital of the}} Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and was besieged for three years by the Seleucid Empire (208–206 BC). After the demise of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, it was ruled by Indo-Scythians, Parthians, Indo-Parthians, Kushan Empire, Indo-Sassanids, Kidarites, Hephthalite Empire and Sassanid Persians before the arrival of the Arabs.|$|E

25|$|The chiffon sari {{did what}} years of fashion {{interaction}} {{had not done}} in India. It homogenised fashion across this land. Its softness, lightness and beautiful, elegant, caressing drape was ideally suited to the Indian climate. Different courts adopted their own styles of draping and indigenising the sari. In most of the courts the sari was embellished with stitching hand-woven borders in gold from Varanasi, delicate zardozi work, gota, makaish and tilla work that embellished the plain fabric, simultaneously satisfying both traditional demands and ingrained love for ornamentation. Some images of maharanis in the Deccan show the women wearing a sleeveless, richly embellished waistcoat over their blouses. The Begum of Savanur remembers how sumptuous the chiffon sari became at their gatherings. At some courts it was worn with jaali, or net kurtas and embossed silk waist length sadris or jackets. Some of them were <b>so</b> <b>rich</b> that the entire ground was embroidered over with pearls and zardozi.|$|E
25|$|Government Salt Superintendents also {{accumulated}} fortunes. They could under-report {{tax revenues}} {{and keep the}} difference for themselves; they could accept fees from applicants for office; or, with a clear conscience, simply accept gifts from salt merchants who were grateful for their help. A good example is Cao Yin (1658-1711). As a personal bondservant and childhood playmate of the Kangxi Emperor, Cao became <b>so</b> <b>rich</b> and influential that he played host four times to the Emperor in his tours of the south. In 1705, as a mark of favor, the emperor ordered Cao, an accomplished scholar, to compile all shi (lyric poems) surviving from the Tang dynasty. Cao compiled and published the Complete Poems of the Tang using proceeds from the Salt Administration. Yet even such a well-connected official relied on the whim of the emperor. The Cao family lost favor and fortune when a new emperor came to the throne, a fall from grace reflected in Dream of the Red Chamber, the nostalgic novel written by Cao Yin's grandson Cao Xueqin.|$|E
25|$|To {{give one}} example of his own area Khizr Hayat Tiwana faced strong {{opposition}} from the descendants of Pirs and sajjada Nashins. In district Shahpur, Khwaja Qamar ul Din Sialvi, Qazi Zafar Hussain, and Qazi Mazhar Qayyum gave tough competition to Tiwanas. Khwaja Qamar ul Din Sialvi of Sial Sharif, a descendant of great pir Khawaja Sham-ud-Din was president of District Shahpur Muslim League. He was very influential in his region. Likewise Qazis of Soon Valley and descendants of Sufi Qazi Mian Muhammad Amjad commanded great respect in their areas. They appealed to their people to vote against Tiwanas. With regard to the exertion of religious influence over the people, the grand father of Khizar Hayat Tiwana, Malik Sahib Khan could not compete with the great grand father of Qazi Zafar Hussain, and Qazi Mazhar Qayyum, Qazi Kalim Allah, and their father Qazi Mian Muhammad Amjad. According to SARAH F. D. ANSARI, the Sajjada Nashin or Pir families were not <b>so</b> <b>rich</b> in terms of land as the great land lords of Punjab but these Sajjada Nashin or Pir families exerted great political and religious influence over the people.|$|E
40|$|Why {{are people}} in the richest {{countries}} of the world <b>so</b> much <b>richer</b> today than 100 years ago? And why are some countries <b>so</b> much <b>richer</b> than others? Questions such as these define the field of economic growth. This paper documents the facts that underlie these questions. How much richer are we today than 100 years ago, and how large are the income gaps between countries? The purpose of the paper is to provide an encyclopedia of the fundamental facts of economic growth upon which our theories are built, gathering them together in one place and updating the facts with the latest available data. ∗In preparation for a new volume of the Handbook of Macroeconomics.
