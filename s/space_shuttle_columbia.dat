5|$|July 1992: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Darby caused cloudiness in California. These clouds were also enough {{to delay the}} landing of the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> for a day, and cause it to land in Florida instead of California.|$|E
5|$|The {{launch of}} the Expedition 1 crew {{occurred}} {{a week before the}} United States presidential election, so it got little attention in the United States. At the time of the mission, the station was expected to be completed in 2006, and be continuously inhabited until at least 2015. Due to several delays, including the fallout from the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> disaster, the station was completed in late 2011, thanks to STS-134.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Russian-American {{interaction}} resumed {{with the}} Shuttle–Mir missions (1995–1998). Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, {{this time a}} full-fledged space station. This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as {{two of the biggest}} partners in the largest space station built: the International Space Station (ISS). The strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> disaster.|$|E
5|$|Due to Hurricane Klaus, <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> launch was delayed.|$|R
50|$|In 1979 the Concorde visited Bergstrom, {{followed}} by the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttles</b> <b>Columbia</b> and Discovery aboard their NASA Boeing 747 carrier aircraft in 1981 and 1985, respectively.|$|R
50|$|In {{keeping with}} an Orbital Sciences tradition, this Cygnus {{spacecraft}} is named the S.S. Rick Husband after the NASA astronaut who commanded the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> fatal STS-107 mission in 2003.|$|R
5|$|Marburger's {{tenure as}} Director {{was the longest}} {{in the history of}} that post. After the September 11 attacks, he helped to {{establish}} the DHS Directorate for Science and Technology within the new Department of Homeland Security. He has been called a central player opposing new restrictions of international scientific exchanges of people and ideas after the attacks. He later was responsible for reorienting the nation's space policy after the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> disaster, and played an important part in the nation's re-entry into the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor program. Marburger was also known for his support of the emerging field of science of science policy, which seeks to analyze how science policy decisions affects a nation's ability to produce and benefit from innovation.|$|E
25|$|Atlantis was {{completed}} in {{about half the time}} it took to build <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia.</b>|$|E
25|$|On February 1, 2003, the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> {{disintegrated}} upon reentering Earth's atmosphere, {{killing all}} seven crew members.|$|E
50|$|Later in its duration, the {{government}} of The Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning for the central and later northern Bahamas, though it was discontinued as the cyclone dissipated.Due to Hurricane Klaus, <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> launch was delayed.|$|R
50|$|The {{second in}} the series of International Microgravity Laboratory {{payloads}} (IML-2) was launched on the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia’s</b> STS-65 mission on 8 July 1994. After remaining in orbit around the Earth for 15 days, the Shuttle landed on 23 July. The seven-member crew included a Japanese astronaut, {{who was the first}} Japanese woman in space.|$|R
25|$|The Columbia Memorial Space Center is the U.S. {{national}} memorial for the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia’s</b> seven crew members. It {{is located}} in Downey {{on the site of}} the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle's</b> origins and production, the former North American Aviation plant in Los Angeles County, southern California. The facility is also a hands-on learning center with interactive exhibits, workshops, and classes about space science, astronautics, and the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> program's legacy — providing educational opportunities for all ages.|$|R
25|$|Over time, several {{scientists}} {{looked into}} trying {{to revive the}} Buran programme, especially after the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> disaster.|$|E
25|$|PS 58 in Staten Island, New York, {{was named}} <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> School {{in honor of}} the failed mission.|$|E
25|$|February 1– The <b>space</b> <b>shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> {{breaks up}} while {{entering}} the atmosphere over Texas killing all seven crew members.|$|E
40|$|Initial {{estimates}} on {{the temperature}} and conditions of the breach in the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> wing focused on analyses of the slag deposits. These deposits are complex mixtures of the reinforced carbon/carbon (RCC) constituents, insulation material, and wing structural materials. Identification of melted/solidified Cerachrome insulation (Thermal Ceramics, Inc., Augusta, GA) indicated that the temperatures at the breach had exceeded 1760 C...|$|R
40|$|The {{difference}} between an orbit and a revolution is explained and it is shown why <b>space</b> <b>shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> period of revolution was longer than its orbital period. Parameters of orbits examined include apoapsis, periapsis, apogee, perigee, aphelion, perihelion, orbital plane, and inclination. Orbit velocity and duration, Newton's law of gravitation, and Kepler's three laws of motion are considered. The principles involved in geostationary satellites are also explored...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} mixtures, oxygen and hydrogen, suffers from the extremely low temperatures required for storing liquid hydrogen (around 20 K or −253 °C) and very low fuel density (70 kg/m³, compared to RP-1 at 820 kg/m³), necessitating large tanks that must also be lightweight and insulating. Lightweight foam insulation on the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> external tank led to the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> destruction, as a piece broke loose, damaged its wing and caused it to break up on atmospheric reentry.|$|R
25|$|The STS-107 mission ended {{abruptly}} when <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> {{was destroyed}} and its crew perished during re-entry, 16 minutes before scheduled landing.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 he {{took part}} in STS-75, aboard <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia,</b> which {{deployed}} TSS-1R, which was a follow-up mission to TSS-1 which had been deployed during STS-46.|$|E
25|$|The Astronaut Memorial Garden {{was created}} and {{dedicated}} {{to the memory of}} the astronauts who died in the Challenger explosion. After the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> disaster, the names of Columbias astronauts were added to the memorial.|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} earth-viewing imagery obtained during <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> flight STS- 35, December 2 - 10, 1990, is reviewed with emphasis on observations of the Southern Hemisphere. In particular, attention is given to environmental observations in areas of Madagascar, Brazil, and Persian Gulf; observation of land resources (Namibia, offshore Australia); and observations of ocean islands (Phillipines, Indonesia, and Reunion). Some of the photographs are included...|$|R
25|$|In 2003, {{following}} <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> breakup upon re-entry, Leinbach was {{the leader}} of the initial debris recovery team in Texas, and Louisiana. He was named to lead the Columbia Reconstruction Team, whose goal was to determine the cause of the accident based only on the debris collected and reassembled at KSC. Following the investigation, Leinbach suggested loaning the debris to various academic institutions for study, to help develop safer spacecraft for the future.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> catastrophic {{accident}} {{was due to}} a piece of Spray on Foam Insulation (SOFI) that broke off from the external tank and damaged {{the leading edge of the}} orbiter's left wing. Millimeter wave focused and near-field imaging methods have been suessfully used for inspecting of the SOFI samples. Comparison between these methods for the purpose of detection and evaluation of flaws in the SOFI is provided using examples of images of SOFI samples...|$|R
25|$|Nematode worms (C. elegans), part of {{an ongoing}} {{research}} project conducted on the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> mission STS-107, survived the re-entry breakup. It {{is believed to be the}} first known life-form to survive a virtually unprotected atmospheric descent to Earth's surface.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 {{the airport}} {{terminal}} building was rededicated to NASA astronaut Rick Husband, {{the commander of}} mission STS-107 of the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> and an Amarillo native. Husband and his crew were killed when the Columbia disintegrated upon re-entry on February 1, 2003.|$|E
25|$|Since their formation, AFNSEP has {{supported}} more than 125 major disasters, including the 1989 Exxon Valdez Oil Spill, several California wildfires, the <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia</b> disaster, several hurricanes to include Andrew and Katrina, and typhoon relief across America and the Pacific region.|$|E
50|$|NASA's Shuttle {{program has}} {{produced}} American and foreign politicians. In 1985, Senator Jake Garn went into space aboard the STS-51-D flight as a payload specialist and in 1986 Rep. Bill Nelson of Florida became the second sitting member of Congress to travel into <b>space</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> STS-61-C mission, {{also as a}} payload specialist. In 2012, shuttle astronaut José M. Hernández ran for Congress in California's 10th District, he won the Democratic nomination, but lost to incumbent Jeff Denham.|$|R
5000|$|The single {{was also}} {{used to make the}} musical {{documentary}} [...] "Columbia's 28". This short film, premiered on YouTube in December 2012, {{tells the story of the}} <b>Space</b> <b>Shuttle</b> <b>Columbia's</b> 28 missions. Filmmaker Salem Hanna chose [...] "Shine Ya Light" [...] as the basis for the video after hearing it on his car radio whilst wondering what music could evoke the soaring spirit of spaceflight, and was particularly drawn to the power of the lyrics as a way to describe cutting edge scientific research.|$|R
