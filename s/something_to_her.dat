Because of that, she is convinced that Sam was coming out of the office to say <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> They argue, admit their feelings for each other, and come into the terms that their relationship with Derek is nothing compared to their potential relationship together. Sam and Diane embrace, but then Diane rejects his advances, i.e. attempts to kiss her. They insult each other and, at the end, kiss passionately.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} she thought Sarah had {{come to terms with}} the fact she is a lesbian, Batley said: [...] "I don't know because from the beginning, Sarah was always boy crazy, so for her, I don't think it's about being one way or the other — I think she's just very clingy. Batley also gave her views on how Sarah should have to developed, opining it would have been good for her to spend more time on her own, be herself and learn who she really is. She felt that Sarah had to often clung on to people and believing that {{ultimately}} it would make her happy. Sarah tries this notion with Zoe, describing this Batley added: [...] "I think that's what happened with Zoe as well because they were such good friends. With Lydia, she brought <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and she got on with her and was sparky, which is something that Sarah liked. I don't know if she'd suddenly turned, though. Maybe she was more bisexual than anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Lydia's {{relationships}} {{helped develop}} the character. Her first relationship off-screen is with ex-girlfriend Charlotte, who supposedly shared her interests in music and fashion, as they were both considered 'out there'. The history of the relationship immediately gave viewers an insight to the character. However, their relationship was seemingly shattered by Lydia's constant jealousy and her clingy nature, which ultimately lead to their break up. But, Lydia {{tried to commit suicide}} soon after, which was told on-screen when Charlotte arrived in the village. Lydia's second relationship is a more serious one, with the sexually confused Sarah Barnes; Sarah, who had previously been portrayed as heterosexual, suffers an identity crisis, coming to terms with her one-night stand with Zoe Carpenter, however Sarah ended the relationship after Lydia became interfering and tried to control her life due to falling in love with her. Speaking to entertainment website Digital Spy about Sarah's relationship with Lydia, Loui Batley commented, [...] "With Lydia, she brought <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and she got on with her and was sparky, which is something that Sarah liked." [...] After her relationship with Sarah ended, the character's true persona was revealed. She became jealous of Sarah and her relationship with Zoe, and the character's vulnerability became the centre of her deranged campaign for revenge {{in the latter part of}} 2009, as she was excluded from Sarah's life.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Oh Mother" [...] was {{met with}} mainly {{positive}} reviews from contemporary music critics. Lucy Davis from BBC Music wrote that the song [...] "might {{mean a lot to}} some, those with the tiresome self defence lyrics should go [...] when she gets on with the singing, there's nothing to prove". Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani deemed [...] "Oh Mother" [...] a [...] "lovely" [...] piano and string melody [...] "that we're offered a reprieve". Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic was also positive toward [...] "Oh Mother", commenting that [...] "another ode to her single mother and middle-finger to her abusive father, is yet more proof that Aguilera works best when the subject matter actually means <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> when the song is more than just something to sing". Spence D. for IGN was positive toward the song's meaning, writing that it [...] "resonates with a bittersweet energy that helps it rise above the standard young pop queen fare of the day". musicOMH's John Murray was not impressed with the song, calling it [...] "good" [...] but saying that it would [...] "just make the bad moments feel so much worse". Digital Spy critic Nick Levine provided a negative review, giving it a two out of five stars rating and calling it [...] "tremulous" [...] with a [...] "vibrato-fuelled conclusion". He also compared [...] "Oh Mother" [...] to Madonna's song [...] "Oh Father" [...] (1989) for the same sad melody as well as the same theme of child abuse.|$|E
2500|$|... "Don't Tell Me" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Mirwais Ahmadzaï and Joe Henry, Madonna's brother-in-law. The demo of the song, {{entitled}} [...] "Stop", was first created by Henry at his home studio with string samples. Later, Henry played the demo {{for his wife and}} she said, [...] "You know, I can really hear Madonna singing this song. You should send it to her, you know, she's making a record in London right now." [...] However, he claimed, [...] "If I was going to pitch <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> I could probably dig something up, but it certainly wouldn't be this." [...] Later, his wife sent Madonna a copy of the demo, but it was so musically different from the record she was making that she didn't know how she could make any use out of it. After some time, he was talking to Madonna on the phone and she asked to rearrange the track to fit in better with the album, recording the song months later. Henry claimed {{in an interview that he}} was surprised that, lyrically, it remained completely intact.|$|E
2500|$|More {{details were}} {{released}} in the days preceding the finale. Michael Weatherly disclosed, [...] "The way this season is ending, and what's gonna happen with Ziva and Tony and Rivkin, it's pretty massive and explosive, and it's gonna span four episodes." [...] De Pablo added, [...] "We could not be farther away from kissing. I'm telling you, it's not 'I hate you' [...] anger; it's 'I want to kill you' anger. Like, 'I want to shoot you in the head, but instead I'm gonna put my gun on your knee' anger….He does <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that is almost unforgivable. However, the reason he does it is because he truly believes it's going to help her. Little does he know that he almost kills her." [...] When asked how the storyline would affect Tony and Ziva's interactions, Tadros replied, [...] "I think that love can hurt and heal. In this case, we'll have opportunity to see both of those things take place. I don't want to say too much, but... I think it will only make their connection stronger, as they learn {{a lot more about}} each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tony helps Gabby {{when she}} is run over. Pickard {{revealed}} that [...] "It's {{love at first sight}} for Tony" [...] when sees Gabby. On how the characters meet, Oruche explained: [...] "She's walking down the street minding her own business. She comes across Tony, he looks at her and says <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> but she doesn't answer him. He thinks she's rude [...] She gets hit by a car [...] he then helps her. She's a woman lying in the gutter so he helps her. [...] he comes to the hospital to meet my children [...] Basically I have no help and I'm unconscious so he has to help me..." [...] Pickard added that Gabby asks him to look after her children, Taylor (Shaun Blackstock) and Amber (Lydia Lloyd-Henry), which he takes as an indication she may feel the same. Oruche explained that while her character is hospitalised Tony and Gabby are [...] "getting used to spending time with each other". Pickard revealed that Tony would become [...] "embroiled in the drama of [...] life". Tony discovers Gabby, like Tony, is married but [...] "like Tony, she's not happy". Pickard revealed that when Gabby's husband, Phil (Andonis Anthony), returns Gabby will be too scared to leave him for Tony. Oruche also spoke of Phil's return, saying that Gabby and Tony [...] "want to spend their lives together but like I said the husband comes back.
