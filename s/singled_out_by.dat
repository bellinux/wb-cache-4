5|$|The Projected Man has {{received}} mixed reviews. Several sources were {{critical of the}} film's resemblance to other science fiction films, with The Fly and 4D Man being <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> critics and moviegoers alike as possible inspirations, although the film's executive producer Richard Gordon has denied this. The Projected Man was featured in a ninth season episode of comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000, and has been released on DVD by Cinema Club.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} season, {{in the last}} regular season meeting between the Avalanche and the Red Wings on March 26, 1997, a brawl known as the Brawl in Hockeytown broke out. The game ended with nine fights, 11 goals, 39 penalties, 148 penalty minutes, one hat-trick (by Valeri Kamensky) and a goalie fight between Stanley Cup champion goalies Patrick Roy and Mike Vernon. Claude Lemieux {{was one of the}} players <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the Red Wings players. The Red Wings ended up winning the game in overtime 6–5. The teams met again in the Western Conference Finals that season, with the Red Wings emerging victorious and going on to win the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from {{representing}} Argentina at {{the tournament}} as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches. After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, {{who had won}} the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista's under-23 squad in Beijing. During the first match, he scored the opening goal and assisted another in their 2–1 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1–0 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2–1 win in extra time. After a 3–0 semi-final victory over Brazil, Messi assisted the only goal in the final as Argentina defeated Nigeria to claim Olympic gold medals. Along with Riquelme, Messi was <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament's best team.|$|E
30|$|The {{notion of}} {{multiculturalism}} is indeed {{much more complex}} and still very much debated (for a recent contribution see: Uberoi & Modood, 2015).

5000|$|The Display Team's {{music has}} been {{influenced}} by [...] "a wide range of pilferable sources, including Frank Zappa, Cardiacs, Mr. Bungle, Queen and a selection of punk and ska bands too numerous (and sometimes obscure) to <b>single</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> name." [...] The band themselves also cite Mad Caddies, Madness, Reel Big Fish, Goldfinger, The Specials and The Beach Boys.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the release}} date for Rumours {{was set for}} February 1977, Fleetwood Mac wanted a <b>single</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> Christmas; [...] "Go Your Own Way" [...] was chosen to fulfill that role.

5|$|While the pay was {{relatively}} good, it still left many players {{looking for other}} jobs during the off-season, while the owners were all wealthy men. The conditions led to two organizing efforts at forming a player's union, which Smythe was vehemently against. From 1957 onwards, Smythe, along with other NHL owners including James D. Norris of the Chicago Black Hawks and his half brother Bruce Norris of the Detroit Red Wings were accused of union busting activities related to the attempt by Ted Lindsay {{and a group of}} NHL players to form an NHL Players Association. Mr. Smythe's role in those affairs are dramatized in the movie, Net Worth. Jimmy Thomson, who was acting captain of the Maple Leafs when the players started to organize was <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> Smythe. Smythe detailed all the monies Thomson had been paid by the organization going back to junior, while he arranged for Thomson to be left off the team, allegedly calling Thomson a traitor and publicly blaming him for the team's poor season. Thomson finally announced to the press that he would never play again for the Maple Leafs. Thomson and Tod Sloan were traded away to Chicago. The NHL owners eventually agreed to make some concessions to the players, such as contributing to the players' pensions. The owners were able to temporarily head off the formation of the union, although it would eventually be organized some ten years later.|$|E

25|$|Wonder's {{version of}} the track is often <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> bassists as the {{greatest}} example of James Jamerson's playing style, with no two bars of music played alike during the whole song; a completely improvisational line that is both melodic and complementary to Wonder's vocal. Background vocals are by The Originals (Freddie Gorman, Walter Gaines, Hank Dixon, C.P. Spencer) and The Andantes (Jackie Hicks, Marlene Barrow, Louvain Demps), and instrumentation by The Funk Brothers.|$|E
60|$|Our two men, as they {{confessed to}} me, were grieved to {{be obliged to}} kill so many poor creatures, who had no notion of their danger; yet, having them all thus in their power, and the first having loaded his piece again, {{resolved}} to let fly both together among them; and <b>singling</b> <b>out,</b> <b>by</b> agreement, which to aim at, they shot together, and killed, or very much wounded, four of them; the fifth, frightened even to death, though not hurt, fell with the rest; so that our men, seeing them all fall together, thought they had killed them all.|$|R

25|$|Once the {{secondary}} feedwater pumps stopped, three auxiliary pumps activated automatically. However, because the valves {{had been closed}} for routine maintenance, the system was unable to pump any water.

This was later <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> NRC officials as a key failure.|$|E

25|$|Under the two occupations, Polish {{citizens}} suffered enormous {{human and}} material losses. It {{is estimated that}} about 5.7 million Polish citizens {{died as a result}} of the German occupation and about 150,000 Polish citizens {{died as a result of}} the Soviet occupation. Ethnic Poles were subjected to both the Nazi and Soviet persecution. The Jews were <b>singled</b> <b>out</b> <b>by</b> the Germans for a quick and total annihilation and about 90% of Polish Jews (close to three million people) were murdered. Jews and others were killed en masse at Nazi extermination camps, such as Auschwitz, Treblinka and Sobibór. Ethnic cleansing and massacres of civilian populations, mostly Poles, were perpetrated in western Ukraine from 1943. The historically unprecedented war crimes committed in Poland were divided at the postwar Nuremberg trials into three main categories of wartime criminality: waging a war of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.|$|E
