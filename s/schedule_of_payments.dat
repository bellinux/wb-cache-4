500|$|The London <b>Schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Payments,</b> of 5 May 1921, {{established}} the full liability {{of the combined}} Central Powers at [...] gold marks. Of this figure, Germany was only required to pay [...] gold marks (...) , a smaller amount than they had previously offered for terms of peace. Reparations were unpopular and strained the German economy but they were payable and from 1919–1931, when reparations ended, Germany paid fewer than [...] gold marks. The Reparation Commission and the Bank for International Settlements gave a total German payment of [...] gold marks, whereas historian Niall Ferguson estimated that Germany paid no more than [...] gold marks. Ferguson also wrote that this sum was only 2.4 per cent of German national income between 1919 and 1932, while Stephen Schuker places the figure {{at an average of}} 2 per cent of national income between 1919 and 1931, in cash and kind, making a total transfer equal to 5.3 per cent of national income for the period. Gerhard Weinberg wrote that reparations were paid, towns were rebuilt, orchards replanted, mines reopened and pensions paid but the burden of repairs was shifted from the German economy to the damaged economies of the victors.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{reparation}} payments by Germany, France occupied the Ruhr in 1923 to enforce payments, causing an international crisis that resulted in the implementation of the Dawes Plan in 1924. This plan outlined a new payment method and raised international loans to help Germany to meet her reparation commitments. Despite this, by 1928 Germany called for a new payment plan, resulting in the Young Plan that established the German reparation requirements at 112 billion marks (...) and created a <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> that would see Germany complete payments by 1988. With the collapse of the German economy in 1931, reparations were suspended for a year and in 1932 during the Lausanne Conference they were cancelled altogether. Between 1919 and 1932, Germany paid less than 21 billion marks in reparations.|$|E
2500|$|The precise figure Germany paid is {{a matter}} of dispute. The German Government {{estimated}} it had paid the equivalent of 67.8 billion gold marks in reparations. The German figure includedother than gold or goods in kindthe scuttling of the interned German fleet at Scapa Flow, state property lost in lands ceded to other countries, and the loss of colonial territories. The Reparation Commission and the Bank for International Settlements state that [...] gold marks was paid by Germany in reparations, of which [...] was paid before the implementation of the London <b>Schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Payments.</b> Niall Ferguson provides a slightly lower figure. He estimates that Germany paid no more than [...] gold marks. Ferguson further estimates that this sum amounted to 2.4 per cent of Germany's national income between 1919 and 1932. Stephen Schuker, in his definitive econometric study (1988, pp.106–19), concedes that Germany transferred 16.8 billion marks over the whole period, but points out that this sum was vastly offset by the devaluation of Allied paper-mark deposits up to 1923, and by loans that Germany subsequently repudiated after 1924. [...] The net capital transfer into Germany amounted to 17.75 billion marks, or 2.1% of Germany's entire national income over the period 1919–1931. In effect, therefore, America paid reparations to Germany—four times more, in price-adjusted terms, than the U.S. furnished to West Germany under the post-1948 Marshall Plan. According to Gerhard Weinberg, reparations were paid, towns were rebuilt, orchards replanted, mines reopened and pensions paid. However, the burden of repairs was shifted away from the German economy and onto the damaged economies of the war's victors.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "fixed" [...] in [...] "fixed income" [...] {{refers to}} both the <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> {{obligatory}} <b>payments</b> and the amount.

40|$|The {{recruitment}} of African Americans into cancer prevention and control studies has presented {{a major challenge}} to scientific investigators. Scientific findings, whether biomedical or behavioral, may not be appropriate and applicable to ethnic minority populations unless they are adequately represented as study participants. Moreover, the need to involve greater numbers of ethnic minorities is quite urgent due to the poor morbidity and mortality outcomes associated with ethnic minority group membership. Such {{is the case with}} breast cancer survivorship. The {{purpose of the study was}} to test a personalized recruitment strategy on response rate in African-American women. The response rate of 45 % (n = 117) African Americans and 64 % (n = 161) white subjects indicated only limited success in the {{recruitment of}} the African-American breast cancer survivors. The recruitment result suggests that culturally relevant recruitment strategies (e. g., inclusion of African-American investigators, culturally consistent letter of recruitment) may be insufficient in adequately increasing research participation. Therefore, further studies on investigating factors that influence research participation (eg, type <b>of</b> incentives, and <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> as well as type of stationery and stamps used) are needed...|$|R

The subject of the article are the Polish foreign obligations to the creditors associated in the Paris Club and London Club. In order to solve the debt problem in 1981 Poland undertook lasting several years negotiations with the creditors associated in the Paris Club and London Club. Breakthrough moments in the conducted restructuring talks were: April 1991 with the Paris Club and March 1994 with the London Club. The agreements concluded with the creditors from both clubs caused a reduction of the Polish foreign debt by about 9. 7 billion USD in 1994. In accordance with the accepted <b>schedules</b> the return <b>of</b> the debts to the Paris Club is to be finished in the year 2009; a small payment is due in the year 2014, whereas to the London Club in the year 2024. The established <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> <b>of</b> the foreign debt which utilizes new techniques of reduction of foreign debts (debt for nature swap, Brady Bonds, buy-back) has as its purpose the creation of time for the Polish economy to develop the export potential, attract foreign investments on a larger scale and to structurally adapt making possible the integration of Poland with the European structures. ...|$|R
