40|$|Proper {{design of}} seawall in {{earthquake}} prone region {{is one of}} the major concerns in geotechnical earthquake engineering. This paper presents the stability analysis of seawall under the combined action of earthquake forces, non-breaking wave force, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces and uplift force. Stability of seawall is assessed in terms of its factor of safety against landward sliding and landward overturning modes of failures. Seismic passive earth resistance has been calculated using pseudo-static approach. A detailed parametric study has been conducted to study the effect of non-breaking wave height, depth of water on seaward and land ward sides, soil and wall friction angles, and horizontal and vertical seismic accelerations. The factor of <b>safety</b> <b>against</b> <b>overturning</b> mode of failure decreases by about 52 %, for a change in the ratio of non-breaking wave height to the depth of water on seaward side from 0 to 0. 60. Present study shows that the seismic stability of seawall is more sensitive to non-breaking wave height, soil friction angle, wall friction angle and horizontal seismic acceleration. Proposed closed form solutions and design charts can be used for the seismic design of seawall for passive case under the combined action of earthquake and non-breaking wave forces.

40|$|By {{using the}} {{modified}} pseudo-dynamic method for submerged soils this paper explores the seismic stability of seawall for the active condition of earth pressure. Different forces such as seismic active earth pressure, seismic inertia {{forces of the}} wall, non-breaking wave pressure, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures are considered in the stability analysis. Limit equilibrium has been used, and expressions for the factor of safety against sliding and overturning mode of failure have been proposed. The proposed methodology overcomes the limitations of existing pseudo-dynamic method for submerged soils. A detailed parametric study has been conducted by varying different parameters and results are presented {{in the form of}} design charts for computation of factor of safety against sliding and overturning mode of failures. It was noticed that the influences of soil friction angle, seismic acceleration coefficient, wall inclination and excess pore pressure are significant when compared to the other parameters. The value of factor of safety against the sliding mode of failure is increasing by about 62 % when the value of soil frictional angle is increased from 30 to 40. It was also found that the factor of <b>safety</b> <b>against</b> <b>overturning</b> mode of failure is decreasing by about 22 % as the value of excess pore pressure ratio increases from 0 to 0. 75. The proposed method with closed-form solutions can be used for the seismic design of seawalls. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The use of fiber-reinforced {{polymers}} (FRP) {{for structural}} strengthening {{has become increasingly}} popular in recent years. Several applications of FRP have been proposed and applied, depending on {{the target of the}} technique, kind and/or material of the structural member. In particular, because of their great tensile strength, FRP materials are commonly used to enhance the out-of-plane behaviour of masonry walls, allowing to increase their strength, ductility and improving <b>safety</b> <b>against</b> <b>overturning.</b> For these reasons, FRP laminates are often applied in vulnerable ancient buildings in seismic areas to reinforce faÃ§ades and walls with poor structural features. However, some issues arise when adopting composites in historical constructions, the most related to the aesthetical impact of laminates and compatibility between FRP and masonry. Consequently, a correct evaluation of the reinforcement percentages for strength and ductility purposes is crucial, as well as the effective increase of structural performances. This paper presents a numerical-analytical approach able to reproduce the flexural behaviour of out-of-plane loaded masonry walls. The model is based on a simplified representation of the member, the latter modeled as a cantilever beam. Mechanical non-linearity is introduced by means of momentâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 curvature relationships, deduced with proper constitutive laws of masonry and by taking into account the ultimate debonding strain of FRP. Second order effects are considered by adopting an iterative step-by-step procedure. Comparisons are made in terms of momentâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 curvature and loadâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 displacement curves with experimental data available in the literature and with non-linear finite element analyses, showing both good agreement. Finally, parametric considerations on the reinforcement percentages are made in terms of strength and ductility...|$|E

40|$|During {{construction}} of dams, rock bolts are in general {{installed in the}} interface between concrete and rock as an extra <b>safety</b> measure <b>against</b> <b>overturning</b> failure. These bolts are however {{not allowed to be}} taken into consideration for the stability calculations of large dams. New standards and new design criterias have increased the requirements of the safety of the old dams, leading to a need for expensive rehabilitation and strengthening. It is possible that consideration of these bolts in stability calculations may lead to money being saved. In order to do so more information about the long term strength of these bolts is needed. One way of getting this information has been the destructive testing of old dugout bolts found during reconstruction works. At the Lima hydropower station in Sweden, this kind of testing was made. The test rig used had a design where a piston pressed down on the rock around the bolt in order to pull it out. The question was raised if this could affect the failure load of the bolt. In this thesis, an attempt was made to answer this question using finite element methods. Models of a rock bolt was made in Abaqus, where one model included the piston and one where it was not. The connection between the bolt and the rock was modelled with nonlinear springs and friction, and the results were then compared between the cases and with experimental data. The results showed that the resulting force-deformation curves may be affected by the piston in cases where the dominant failure mode was adhesive failure, which would influence failure loads and deformations. Since so little was known about the properties of the rock and grout at Lima however, it is difficult to say to which extent the test rig has affected these results...|$|R
40|$|To manage China’s growing {{demands of}} electricity, more and larger dams {{could be a}} part of the solution. It is {{important}} to evaluate and perform safety analysis for existing dams, in order to improve our understanding and knowledge about future dams. In this master thesis, a safety research of Longtan Dam on the Hongshui River in China was analysed. The main objectives in this research were to construct a 3 D model and determine the critical points of large stress, strain and yield area in the dam for different cases. The factor of safety for sliding when primary loads were acting on the dam was calculated to be 0. 50 for the non-overflow section of the dam and 0. 48 for the overflow section. A <b>safety</b> factor <b>against</b> <b>overturning</b> was also calculated for the non-overflow and overflow section to 2. 24 and 1. 96 respectively. The results showed that the dam was safe from both sliding and overturning. The numerical results for distribution of stress, strain and yield area were simulated in 3 D models by using ANSYS, a finite element program. Several cases for non-overflow and overflow sections of Longtan Dam were analysed for different heights and load combinations. For the first three cases where only self-weight was applied on the dam, high impacts of stress and strain were located at the dam heel, toe and at the largest maintenance tunnel of the dam. Appearance of plastic strain was also found around these areas. However, when primary loads were applied to the dam sections, the values of stress and strain became larger, especially in the toe area. In the last case when the dam was subjected to seismic activity, the distribution of stress and strain along the z-direction (along the dam) showed an uneven distribution, hence showing the importance of simulation in 3 D...|$|R
40|$|The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a {{numerical}} analysis technique for obtaining approximate solutions. Its origin can be tracked {{back to the}} 1940 s. The technique, which {{during the second half}} of the 20 th century required programming skills and a deep understanding of its underlying theory, has during the last decade been implemented in more user friendly software. Models are built in CAD-like environment and the results are illustrated in easy to understand color graphics. Advancements in computer technology have made it possible to build and analyze more advanced models. These advancements have initiated a growing interest in going from mostly 2 D-analysis to full scale 3 D-models that describe whole constructions. The work done in this report has been performed in cooperation with the consulting company SWECO Infrastructure, which during the first half of 2011 has been designing a hydroelectric power station. The hydroelectric power station in question is Kraftstation VI in the Swedish town Hissmofors. By working with the FEM-software Abaqus, a full scale model of Kraftstation VI has been built and analyzed. The first part of the report focus on modeling technique and some potential sources of error that might arise in FEM-models such as the one in the report. The geometry of the power station is complex which motivated the use of solid elements. Since most of the construction is subjected to bending the choice of using 20 -node cube elements was made. Dam constructions are subjected to one-sided water pressure; therefore its <b>safety</b> <b>against</b> <b>overturning</b> and sliding must be established. This is done through stability calculations where all the loads acting on the construction is considered. It is desirable to be able to calculate the stability through the use of the FEM-model and therefore a method for doing that is developed. The model is analyzed by studying three different loading scenarios: Loading scenario 1 – A global analysis of the hydroelectric power station when it is subjected to the expected everyday loads. The focus is on investigating the interaction between the different parts of the station and identifying possible stress concentrations.  Loading scenario 2 – A stability analysis of the station with complementary hand calculations. The results indicate that the method is accurate and that the station is stable.  Loading scenario 3 – Calculation of the design moment in ultimate limit state in one of the walls of the intake. The results are compared to the design values that SWECO used when designing the wall. The comparison shows that the calculations done in Abaqus returns lower design moment that those of SWECO.

40|$|Two {{models are}} {{proposed}} {{to analyze the}} seismic behavior of cracked concrete gravity dams {{in order to assess}} the <b>safety</b> <b>against</b> sliding and <b>overturning.</b> A proposed rigid model first designed for cracked concrete dams considers the geometry of the cracked dam and includes all possible modes of motion with 3 degrees-of-freedom. The other model proposed is a flexible finite element model, which represents a penalty approach, based on the incremental displacement constraint equations between the nodes {{on both sides of the}} crack. All governing equations and corresponding conditions for every mode of motion are derived for the rigid model. Verifications show that this simple rigid model is effective in the prediction of the seismic response of cracked dams. Its applications to the cracked Koyna Dam and a typical dam cracked at the base demonstrate its advantages of simplicity, accuracy and ability to reveal the important features of seismic behavior of cracked concrete dams. The flexible model is verified with available solutions, showing its very good applicability in estimation of the dynamic response of cracked concrete dams, owing to its adequate treatment of contact conditions at the crack. Its applications to Koyna Dam and a typical dam prove its adequacy to the cases of cracks at both the base and at a height. Computations with both proposed models show that the cracked Koyna Dam and the cracked typical dam are safe under the earthquakes considered provided the effective coefficient of friction is sufficient large. However, both models suggest that the rocking mode must be considered since it affects the sliding displacement even if the rocking itself is very small. The partial dam above the crack might experience drifting if severe impact occurs. Therefore even a large coefficient of friction cannot prevent sliding. The residual sliding displacement along the crack for a specific cracked dam depends on factors such as coefficient of friction, water level, peak acceleration of earthquake and its details. The consistency of two proposed models is noted when increasing the stiffness in the flexible model. This suggests that the rigid model is applicable to the case when the upper part of the cracked dam is very stiff, while the flexible model is capable of revealing more details of the seismic behavior of cracked dams...|$|R
