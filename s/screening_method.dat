5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E
5|$|Various chromatographic {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to detect psilocin in body fluids: the rapid emergency drug identification system (REMEDi HS), a drug <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> based on HPLC; HPLC with electrochemical detection; GC–MS; and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Although the determination of psilocin levels in urine can be performed without sample clean-up (i.e., removing potential contaminants that make it difficult to accurately assess concentration), the analysis in plasma or serum requires a preliminary extraction, followed by derivatization of the extracts in the case of GC–MS. A specific immunoassay has also been developed to detect psilocin in whole blood samples. A 2009 publication reported using HPLC to quickly separate forensically important illicit drugs including psilocybin and psilocin, which were identifiable within about half a minute of analysis time. These analytical techniques to determine psilocybin concentrations in body fluids are, however, not routinely available, and not typically used in clinical settings.|$|E
25|$|Abnormal {{findings}} on screening are further investigated by surgically removing {{a piece of}} the suspicious lumps (biopsy) to examine them under the microscope. Ultrasound may be used to guide the biopsy needle during the procedure. Magnetic resonance imaging is used to guide treatment, but is not an established <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> for healthy women.|$|E

30|$|The Qibao {{screening}} modality {{was designed}} to use different <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> combinedly and focus on Chinese women possibly {{at high risk of}} the disease. Based on the age-specific incidence and age-specific sensitivity of different <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> in this population, we find that the adjustment in age-group at high risk and the modification of <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> can save costs for examination without trading off any effectiveness. These results suggest that the Qibao screening modality can be further improved. Cost-effective analysis of the program, however, is warranted to optimize and expand the use of the modality in China.|$|R
25|$|Historically, CDGs are {{classified}} as Types I and II (CDG-I and CDG-II), depending on the nature and location of the biochemical defect in the metabolic pathway relative to the action of oligosaccharyltransferase. The most commonly used <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> for CDG, analysis of transferrin glycosylation status by isoelectric focusing, ESI-MS, or other techniques, distinguish between these subtypes in so called Type I and Type II patterns.|$|E
25|$|Mammography is {{a common}} <b>screening</b> <b>method,</b> since it is {{relatively}} fast and widely available in developed countries. Mammography {{is a type of}} radiography used on the breasts. It is typically used for two purposes: to aid in the diagnosis of a woman who is experiencing symptoms or has been called back for follow-up views (called diagnostic mammography), and for medical screening of apparently healthy women (called screening mammography).|$|E
25|$|Liquid-based {{cytology}} {{is another}} potential <b>screening</b> <b>method.</b> Although {{it was probably}} intended to improve on {{the accuracy of the}} Pap test, its main advantage has been {{to reduce the number of}} inadequate smears from around 9% to around 1%. This reduces the need to recall women for a further smear. The United States Preventive Services Task Force supports screening every 5 years in those who are between 30 and 65 years when cytology is used in combination with HPV testing.|$|E

25|$|Plasmids are {{engineered}} {{to produce a}} protein product in which the DNA-binding domain (BD) fragment is fused onto a protein while another plasmid is {{engineered to}} produce a protein product in which the activation domain (AD) fragment is fused onto another protein. The protein fused to the BD may {{be referred to as}} the bait protein, and is typically a known protein the investigator is using to identify new binding partners. The protein fused to the AD may be referred to as the prey protein and can be either a single known protein or a library of known or unknown proteins. In this context, a library may consist of a collection of protein-encoding sequences that represent all the proteins expressed in a particular organism or tissue, or may be generated by synthesising random DNA sequences. Regardless of the source, they are subsequently incorporated into the protein-encoding sequence of a plasmid, which is then transfected into the cells chosen for the <b>screening</b> <b>method.</b> This technique, when using a library, assumes that each cell is transfected with no more than a single plasmid and that, therefore, each cell ultimately expresses no more than a single member from the protein library.|$|E
25|$|Screening by {{hysteroscopy}} {{to obtain}} cell samples obtained for histological examination is being developed. This {{is similar to}} the current pap smear that is used to detect cervical cancer. The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening is testing a screening technique that combines CA-125 blood tests with transvaginal ultrasound. Other studies suggest that this screening procedure may be effective. However, it's not yet clear if this approach could actually help to save lives—the full results of the trial will be published in 2015. One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery. The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable <b>screening</b> <b>method.</b> It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population. Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.|$|E
2500|$|The Cochrane {{collaboration}} (2013) {{states that}} the best quality evidence neither demonstrates a reduction in cancer specific, nor a reduction in all cause mortality from screening mammography. When less rigorous trials {{are added to the}} analysis there is a reduction in mortality due to breast cancer of 0.05% (a decrease of 1 in 2000 deaths from breast cancer over 10 years or a relative decrease of 15% from breast cancer). Screening over 10 years results in a 30% increase in rates of over-diagnosis and over-treatment (3 to 14 per 1000) and more than half will have at least one falsely positive test. This has resulted in the view that {{it is not clear whether}} mammography screening does more good or harm. Cochrane states that, due to recent improvements in breast cancer treatment, and the risks of false positives from breast cancer screening leading to unnecessary treatment, [...] "it therefore no longer seems beneficial to attend for breast cancer screening" [...] at any age. Whether MRI as a <b>screening</b> <b>method</b> has greater harms or benefits when compared to standard mammography is not known.|$|E

40|$|International audienceScreening {{methods are}} used as a {{first-line}} approach to detect the presence of antibiotic residues in food of animal origin. The validation process guarantees that the method is fit-for-purpose, suited to regulatory requirements, and provides evidence of its performance. This article is focused on intra-laboratory validation. The first step in validation is characterisation of performance, and the second step is the validation itself with regard to pre-established criteria. The validation approaches can be absolute (a single method) or relative (comparison of methods), overall (combination of several characteristics in one) or criterion-by-criterion. Various approaches to validation, {{in the form of}} regulations, guidelines or standards, are presented and discussed to draw conclusions on their potential application for different residue <b>screening</b> <b>methods,</b> and {{to determine whether or not}} they reach the same conclusions. The approach by comparison of methods is not suitable for <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> for antibiotic residues. The overall approaches, such as probability of detection (POD) and accuracy profile, are increasingly used in other fields of application. They may be of interest for <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> for antibiotic residues. Finally, the criterion-by-criterion approach (Decision 2002 / 657 /EC and of European guideline for the validation of <b>screening</b> <b>methods),</b> usually applied to the <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> for antibiotic residues, introduced a major characteristic and an improvement in the validation, i. e. the detection capability (CCbeta). In conclusion, <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> are constantly evolving, thanks to the development of new biosensors or liquid chromatography coupled to tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. There have been clear changes in validation approaches these last 20 years. Continued progress is required and perspectives for future development of guidelines, regulations and standards for validation are presented here...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{the present}} work, {{we aim to}} {{transfer}} {{to the field of}} virtual screening the predictiveness curve, a metric that has been advocated in clinical epidemiology. The literature describes the use of predictiveness curves to evaluate the performances of biological markers to formulate diagnoses, prognoses and assess disease risks, assess the fit of risk models, and estimate the clinical utility of a model when applied to a population. Similarly, we use logis‑ tic regression models to calculate activity probabilities related to the scores that the compounds obtained in virtual screening experiments. The predictiveness curve can provide an intuitive and graphical tool to compare the predic‑ tive power of virtual <b>screening</b> <b>methods.</b> Results: Similarly to ROC curves, predictiveness curves are functions of the distribution of the scores and provide a common scale for the evaluation of virtual <b>screening</b> <b>methods.</b> Contrarily to ROC curves, the dispersion of the scores is well described by predictiveness curves. This property allows the quantification of the predictive performance of virtual <b>screening</b> <b>methods</b> on a fraction of a given molecular dataset and makes the predictiveness curve an efficient tool to address the early recognition problem. To this last end, we introduce the use of the total gain and partial total gain to quantify recognition and early recognition of active compounds attributed to the variations of the scores obtained with virtual <b>screening</b> <b>methods.</b> Additionally to its usefulness in the evaluation of virtual <b>screening</b> <b>methods...</b>|$|R
