5|$|Designing the in-game propaganda, {{they studied}} {{its use in}} history, finding {{the same pattern of}} {{elements}} reappearing throughout the centuries. In place of the militarily inspired propaganda of the first game, Dishonored 2 would employ a <b>subtler</b> approach; lavish posters for invariably canceled enterprises meant to aid the people of Serkonos were made to exhibit the nature of tyranny as practised by the Duke of Serkonos and his government. To further detail the world, the narration team would come up with fictitious products and brand names and make advertisements of them.|$|E
5|$|Townsend, the founder, songwriter, and {{frontman}} {{of extreme}} metal band Strapping Young Lad and progressive metal group The Devin Townsend Band, dissolved both bands in 2006 {{to spend time}} with his family and avoid the burnout of touring and interviewing. After a period of self-discovery and a year-long break from songwriting, Townsend began work on a four-album series to clarify his identity as a musician. Ki includes themes of self-control and sobriety, and is musically <b>subtler</b> than much of the artist's previous work, consisting of ambient rock music interlaced with tentative bursts of heavy metal.|$|E
5|$|Never 7 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the story, and presses a button to advance through the text. At certain points, the player gets to make choices which affect the {{direction}} the plot proceeds in; these involve choosing what location to move to, and what the player character should say, as well as <b>subtler</b> choices such as whether to look {{a girl in the}} eyes or to take her hand. The game is presented from a first-person perspective, with pre-rendered backgrounds and 2D character portraits accompanying the text. The visuals mostly consist of still images, but with characters often changing their expression while talking.|$|E

25|$|The {{first three}} planes {{belong to the}} <b>subtle</b> sphere, the fourth is on the {{threshold}} between the <b>subtle</b> and the mental spheres and the fifth and sixth planes are in the mental sphere. The first plane starts from {{the threshold of the}} gross and the <b>subtle</b> sphere. The soul here starts experiencing <b>subtle</b> phenomena simultaneously through its gross and <b>subtle</b> senses. It starts hearing <b>subtle</b> sounds and smelling <b>subtle</b> scents, although their nature is far different from their gross equivalents. Eventually it starts perceiving the <b>subtle</b> world through its <b>subtle</b> body and so comes to the second plane. Here the soul becomes aware of infinite energy and can perform minor miracles, like stopping moving objects or filling dried wells with fresh water. Being not conscious of the gross world its experience gives rise only to <b>subtle</b> impressions of the sights, scents and sounds of the <b>subtle</b> world. Further involution of consciousness makes the soul experience the third plane. Here the soul can use more aspects of the infinite energy by performing greater miracles, such as giving sight to the blind, or restoring maimed limbs.|$|R
30|$|<b>Subtle</b> endometriosis is scored {{separately}} from typical lesions. By pathology, they are different, the former being active lesions, {{the latter being}} burnt-out lesions. <b>Subtle</b> lesions in contrast with typical lesions are not associated with the LUF syndrome while no data indicate today that <b>subtle</b> lesions cause pain or infertility. Another important argument to score <b>subtle</b> lesions separately is that typical lesions are readily recognized during laparoscopy, whereas the recognition of <b>subtle</b> lesions varies with the expertise and the scrutiny of the surgeon. A separate classification will permit to evaluate whether <b>subtle</b> lesions are clinically important for pain, infertility, progression, and most importantly whether <b>subtle</b> lesions predict more severe lesions in the future. For the patient, it indeed would be important to know whether <b>subtle</b> lesions herald the onset of more severe lesions or whether they should be considered less important.|$|R
5|$|Vanbrugh planned The Relapse, too, round these limited casting {{resources}} and minor talents, which Peter Holland has argued explains the robust, farcical {{character of the}} play; Vanbrugh's second comedy, The Provoked Wife (1697), written for the better actors of the cooperative company, is a much <b>subtler</b> piece. The Relapse was written in six weeks and offered to the Patent Company in March, {{but because of the}} problems with contracting and retaining actors, it did not première until November. It is known from Cibber's autobiography that Vanbrugh had a decisive say in the ongoing casting changes made during these seven months; it is not known whether he altered his text to accommodate them.|$|E
5|$|Black can try {{the minor}} line 4...Nc6 that delays the {{development}} of its dark-square bishop, to develop it along the a1–h8 diagonal instead of the a3–f8 diagonal, depending on the circumstances. But the main line is 4...Bc5 to attack the f2-pawn, forcing 5.e3, blocking in White's bishop on c1, so that after 5...Nc6 White will not have enough pieces to protect his e5-pawn in the long run. Placing the bishop on the c5-square also has <b>subtler</b> points, as Tseitlin explains:At first sight the bishop on c5 lacks prospects, being held at bay by the pawn on e3, and is insecure {{in view of the}} threat to exchange it by Nc3–a4/e4. In reality, posting the bishop here has a deep strategic significance. It holds up the advance of the e- and the f-pawns (assuming the white bishop will go to b2), and thereby secures e5 as a future knight outpost, which in turn restricts the activity of both White's bishops. As to the exchanging threat, the bishop may conveniently retreat on a7 or f8, or even in some cases remain on c5 with support from a pawn on b6.|$|E
5|$|II. Adagio in A-flat major, A–B–A–B–A form. Nostalgic in its {{traditional}} classical character (one {{of the few}} instrumental adagios Schubert wrote), the opening theme of this movement is an elegant, touching melody that eventually undergoes remarkable tonal and cadential treatment, undermining the peaceful setting. Charles Fisk {{has pointed out that}} the voice-leading of the first phrase, 1–7–1–2–3–4–3, is based on the initial A-flat digression {{in the beginning of the}} Allegro. The unorthodox, chromatic harmonic structure of this movement is generated from a short progression that appears towards the end of the A section, leading to a plagal cadence in the subdominant key (D-flat), chromatically colored with its own minor subdominant chord (G-flat minor). The importance of this progression and of D-flat in general is emphasized by its quotation in a climax of the finale's exposition. This diversion of the main theme's expected cadence leads to the haunted atmosphere of the B section, which is full of chromatic modulations and startling sforzandos. In the second appearance of the A and B sections, almost the entire music is shifted a semitone up, further cementing the importance of the ascending minor 2nd in the sonata as a whole. The focal plagal progression returns transformed at the end of the movement, with even <b>subtler</b> chromatic coloration and more distant modulations, touching on C major, before the piece finally ends in the tonic, the theme now weakened and given an illusory quality due to the evasion of cadences, free modulation, and tendency toward digression into troubled minor passages.|$|E
30|$|The {{significance}} of <b>subtle</b> lesions is unclear. <b>Subtle</b> lesions {{are considered the}} first lesions after implantation of endometrial cells. It remains unclear however, whether <b>subtle</b> lesions are the initial phase of a progressive disease [31], or whether <b>subtle</b> lesions do occur intermittently in all women [43, 44] emerging, regressing, and re-emerging at other places of the pelvis.|$|R
40|$|The current {{research}} examined reactions to <b>subtle</b> versus blatant expressions of prejudice. Across four studies, participants reported their recognition of prejudice, affective responses, and behavioural intentions resulting from expressions of <b>subtle</b> and blatant sexism and racism. In {{the first three}} studies, participants were presented with prototypical expressions of <b>subtle</b> and blatant prejudice that were not given any context. They {{were then asked to}} provide their reactions to these statements. Patterns of differential responding to <b>subtle</b> and blatant prejudice were observed, such that <b>subtle</b> prejudice was recognized as prejudice less than blatant prejudice, evoked less negative affect and less concern over discrimination potentially resulting, and participants had less intention to confront <b>subtle</b> prejudice than blatant prejudice. In the fourth study, <b>subtle</b> and blatant prejudice were used as explanations for a hiring decision. The same pattern of differential responding to <b>subtle</b> and blatant prejudice emerged, as hiring decisions based on <b>subtle</b> prejudice were viewed as more legitimate than hiring decisions based on blatant prejudice. Further, this differential pattern of responding was also observed for sexism compared to racism, with sexism less likely to be recognized than racism, and thus sexist hiring decisions perceived as more legitimate than racist hiring decisions. This research demonstrates that <b>subtle</b> expressions of prejudice, increasingly common in contemporary society, are likely to go unnoticed and therefore, unchallenged...|$|R

The four parts cover: the continuing significance of sexism; <b>subtle</b> sexism in organizational settings; <b>subtle</b> sexism as social control; and how to change <b>subtle</b> sexism practices...|$|R
5|$|The name of Sejanus {{continued}} to be pressed into political service during the 18th century. Prime Minister Robert Walpole was attacked in 1735 {{in the course of}} a popular skit, C----- and country: A play of seven acts...the whole concluding with the grand masque, call'd, The downfall of Sejanus; its authorship is attributed to 'a masquerader' and in the printed version the masque precedes the play, although it is performed last. This gives the clue of how to take what is to follow and consists of a conversation between Punch and the Hangman, opening with the question 'Is this same Sejanus to go out of the World like a Man, or to die the Death of a mad Dog? For he has lived like a sad One, from the first Day that the Emperor Tiberius took him into Favour.' A <b>subtler</b> attack on a later prime minister occurred in 1769 when Jonson's Sejanus was reissued under the title of The Favourite. This was prefaced with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Lord Bute, denying that there can be any comparison between the conduct of Sejanus and that of his lordship.|$|E

50|$|Chakras are energy centers or {{vortices}} in the <b>subtle</b> body. They {{are located}} at the physical counterparts of the major plexuses of arteries, veins and nerves.

25|$|Sphere packing on {{the corners}} of a {{hypercube}} (with the spheres defined by Hamming distance) corresponds to designing error-correcting codes: if the spheres have radius t, then their centers are codewords of a (2t+1)-error-correcting code.

25|$|Cynic's 2008 album Traced in Air melded {{together}} the styles and influences heard on 1993's Focus {{with the more}} progressive-oriented Portal approach. The result had Cynic put less emphasis on its extreme metal elements, with new guttural vocalist Tymon Kruidenier playing a smaller role than Tony Teegarden did on Focus. Additionally, Paul Masvidal all but abandoned his vocoder robotic vocals, opting instead for a more natural singing voice, with a <b>subtler</b> —although noticeable— vocoder layer that increases an octave his voice.|$|E
25|$|The {{hands and}} facial {{features}} of the groundbreaking animatronic puppets in the film were controlled with relatively primitive rods and cables, although radio control later took over many of the <b>subtler</b> movements. Human performers inside the puppets supplied basic movement for the larger creatures, which in some cases was dangerous or exhausting; for example, the Garthim costumes were so heavy that the performers had to be hung up on a rack every few minutes to rest while still inside the costumes.

25|$|Some {{studies have}} shown that {{nitrogen}} eutrophication decreases the amount of carbon allocation to soil biota over longer periods of time. This can pose problems to the mycobionts, whose production of sporocarps later in the growing season is totally dependent upon the allocation of photosynthates from host plants. Unlike the major community shifts that can occur in sporocarp responses to nitrogen addition, root tips and soil hyphae respond in a considerably <b>subtler</b> manner in the short term. However, over longer periods of time, eutrophication can cause major shifts in the dominant fungi and dramatically alter belowground diversity.|$|E
25|$|Rachmaninoff's style showed {{initially}} {{the influence of}} Tchaikovsky. Beginning in the mid-1890s, his compositions began showing a more individual tone. His First Symphony has many original features. Its brutal gestures and uncompromising power of expression were unprecedented in Russian music at the time. Its flexible rhythms, sweeping lyricism and stringent economy of thematic material were all features he kept and refined in subsequent works. After the three fallow years following the poor reception of the symphony, Rachmaninoff's style began developing significantly. He started leaning towards sumptuous harmonies and broadly lyrical, often passionate melodies. His orchestration became <b>subtler</b> and more varied, with textures carefully contrasted, and his writing on the whole became more concise.|$|E
25|$|Dreyfus also {{identified}} a <b>subtler</b> assumption about the world. AI researchers (and futurists and science fiction writers) often {{assume that there}} is no limit to formal, scientific knowledge, because they assume that any phenomenon in the universe can be described by symbols or scientific theories. This assumes that everything that exists can be understood as objects, properties of objects, classes of objects, relations of objects, and so on: precisely those things that can be described by logic, language and mathematics. The question of what exists is called ontology, and so Dreyfus calls this the ontological assumption. If this is false, then it raises doubts about what we can ultimately know and what intelligent machines will ultimately be able to help us to do.|$|E

40|$|Pettigrew and Meertens's (1995) scale {{attempts}} {{to distinguish between}} <b>subtle</b> and blatant forms of prejudice. In this paper we sought to test {{the validity of the}} measures included in the scale. We argue that the <b>subtle</b> prejudice scale lacks construct validity due mainly to two major flaws of the scale: first, the construct was operationalized via some items which do not show discriminant validity with the blatant prejudice measures; second, some <b>subtle</b> prejudice items just measure perception of cultural differences, but it is unclear whether the perception of cultural differences unambiguously reflects prejudice. A group of 356 Italian participants filled out measures of <b>subtle</b> and blatant prejudice, ethnocentrism, and political orientation. Results show that most indicators of <b>subtle</b> prejudice actually belong to the traditional general prejudice factor. The cultural differences sub-scale fails to achieve concurrent validity, suggesting that this scale is weakly related to the <b>subtle</b> prejudice construct; moreover, we show that the cultural differences subscale, if considered an indicator of <b>subtle</b> prejudice, leads to misleading results and interpretations...|$|R
40|$|Humans, both {{consciously}} and unconsciously, use <b>subtle</b> expressions to indirectly {{communicate their}} emotions and intentions through {{variations of the}} gaze direction, pitch of speech and gesture speed. Humans also perceive changes in the internal states of others from <b>subtle</b> changes in their expressivities while interacting with them. <b>Subtle</b> expressivity plays the supporting part to the leading role of explicit expressivity, such as contents of speech or category of facial expressions. However, <b>subtle</b> expressivity {{plays an important role}} to gently regulate the relationship among the participants of an continuous interaction. The design and evaluation of <b>subtle</b> expressivity are challenges for designers and researchers of embodied characters. How do the <b>subtle</b> variations in expressioninfluence the interaction? What types of <b>subtle</b> expressions are most important for the design of interactive media? How can the effect of the expressions be reliably measured? To address these questions, we gathered related studies for this workshop. We hope that this workshop will serve as a forum for vivid discussions and hence point out future research directions...|$|R
