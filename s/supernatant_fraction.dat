50|$|Fractions I, II, and III are precipitated out at earlier stages. The {{conditions}} of the earlier stages are 8% ethanol, pH 7.2, &minus;3 °C, and 5.1% protein for Fraction I; 25% ethanol, pH of 6.9, &minus;5 °C, and 3% protein. The albumin remains in the <b>supernatant</b> <b>fraction</b> during the solid/liquid extraction under these conditions. Fraction IV has several unwanted proteins {{that need to be}} removed. In order to do this, the conditions are varied in order to precipitate the proteins out. The conditions to precipitate these proteins are raising the ethanol concentration from 18 to 40% and raising the pH from 5.2 to 5.8. Finally, albumin is located in fraction V. The precipitation of albumin is done by reducing the pH to 4.8, which is near the pI of the protein, and maintaining the ethanol concentration to be 40%, with a protein concentration of 1%. Thus, only 1% of the original plasma remains in the fifth fraction.|$|E
50|$|When {{talking about}} the {{particles}} in soymilk, researchers commonly refer to the particles in the soymilk system based on particle size and fractionation. The precipitated fraction refers to particulate protein particles that are >40 nm in size, the <b>supernatant</b> <b>fraction</b> contains soluble proteins <40 nm and all lipids exist in the floating fraction after the soymilk is heated. At room temperature (20 degrees C) the soy proteins and corresponding subunits are in their native state and located in the particulate fraction and soluble fraction. The particulate fraction displays the lipid oil bodies are surrounded by majority of 11S subunits and 7S subunits. When heated, to 65-75 degrees C, the 7S subunits dissociate first moving to the soluble fraction and the oil bodies are released into the soluble and floating fraction. After high temperature subjected to a high temperature (75-95 degrees C) the protein-lipid complex is completely dissociated as the 11S subunits dissociate. What remains in the particulate fraction are 11S and 7S subunits that interact and oil bodies remain in the floating fraction.|$|E

In the latter fraction, GSH transferases B and AA, but not GSH transferases A and C, possessed inhibitory activity. GSH transferase B replaced the soluble <b>supernatant</b> <b>fraction</b> as an effective inhibitor of lipid peroxidation in vitro. If the microsomes were pretreated with the phospholipase A 2 inhibitor p-bromophenacyl bromide, neither the soluble <b>supernatant</b> <b>fraction</b> nor GSH transferase B inhibited lipid peroxidation in vitro. Similarly, if all microsomal enzymes were heat-inactivated and lipid peroxidation was initiated with FeCl 3 /sodium ascorbate neither the soluble <b>supernatant</b> <b>fraction</b> nor GSH transferase B caused inhibition, but in both cases inhibition could be restored by the addition of porcine pancreatic phospholipase A 2 to the incubation. It is concluded that the inhibition of microsomal lipid peroxidation in vitro requires the consecutive action of phospholipase A 2, which releases fatty acyl hydroperoxides from peroxidized phospholipids, and GSH peroxidases, which reduce them.

Pulmonary compliance fell and the alveolar-arterial O 2 gradient widened in normothermic rats during constant ventilation in the resting tidal volume range, and, in hyperthermic rats (approximately 39 degrees C) similarly ventilated but with the addition of periodic sighs. The total amount of airway DSPC was undiminished in each group, but in each less DSPC was present in the 1, 000 -g <b>supernatant</b> <b>fraction</b> compared with controls. Alveolar instability and hypoxemia also developed in hyperthermic rats during low volume ventilation without periodic sighs.

Isolation protocols of adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) rely on the cell's ability to adhere to tissue culture plastic overnight. It was evaluated whether the floating ASC fractions are also of interest for cell-based therapies. In addition, the impact of age, body mass index (BMI) and harvest site was assessed. METHODS: The surface protein profile {{with the use of}} flow cytometry, the cell yield and the doubling time of passages 4, 5 and 6 of ASC from 30 donors were determined. Adherent and <b>supernatant</b> <b>fractions</b> were compared. The impact of age, BMI and harvest site on cell yield and doubling times was determined. RESULTS: Both adherent and <b>supernatant</b> <b>fractions</b> showed high mean fluorescence intensities for CD 13, CD 29, CD 44, CD 73, CD 90 and CD 105 and comparatively low mean fluorescence intensities for CD 11 b, CD 62 L, intracellular adhesion molecule- 1 and CD 34. Doubling times of adherent and <b>supernatant</b> <b>fractions</b> did not differ significantly. Whereas the old age group had a significantly lower cell yield compared with the middle aged group, BMI and harvest site had no impact on cell yield. Finally, doubling times for passages 4, 5 and 6 were not influenced by the age and BMI of the donors, nor the tissue-harvesting site.

Reconstitution of the pellet fractions (containing polypeptide N complexed with the virion RNA) and the <b>supernatant</b> <b>fractions</b> (containing polypeptides L and NS) restored transcriptase activity at 31 °C in all combinations, but at 39 °C transcription was observed only {{in the presence of}} the <b>supernatant</b> <b>fractions</b> of wild-type and revertant viruses but not {{in the presence of the}} <b>supernatant</b> <b>fractions</b> of tsE 1.

The majority of the hemolytic activity was nonlatent and associated with a particle fraction sedimenting at 48, 000 X g (maximum) for 1 h.

The sigmoidal nature of the progress curve of postnuclear supernatant hemolysis, as well as synergistic interactions between fractions of amoebal whole cell extracts, suggests that the hemolytic activity has a multicomponent nature, with at least two and possibly three components participating in the hemolytic event.

Also, N-oxidation of DMA was reduced by 53 % at pH 7. 0, while oxidation of cytochrome P- 450 specific substrates was inhibited by only 19 %. Kinetic studies of DMA N-oxidation indicate no significant change in the apparent Km in ascorbate supplemented or deficient animals. The in vitro addition of ascorbic acid had no effect on the activity of the FMO. The toxicological implications of the reduction in FMO activity in ascorbic acid deficiency are discussed...|$|R

Bacteriol. 90 : 1552 – 1556. 1965. —An inhibitor for diphtheria toxin action on HeLa cells was {{demonstrated in the}} growth <b>supernatant</b> <b>fractions</b> of both toxinogenic and nontoxinogenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and in the Mueller and Miller medium in which these organisms were grown. The inhibitor in the growth <b>supernatant</b> <b>fractions</b> of the nontoxinogenic strain was dialyzable, stable to autoclaving, and stable on storage {{in the refrigerator for}} a period of many months, but was destroyed by ashing. When the components of Mueller and Miller medium were analyzed, only the Casamino Acids proved inhibitory. Further study with artificial mixtures of amino acids revealed that glutamine alone inhibited toxin. It was subsequently shown that ammonium salts and the aliphatic amines, glycamine and prolamine, could also function as inhibitors. Histamine and 16 amino acids tested individually were ineffective. The effectiveness of the amines and the ineffectiveness of sodium or potassium ions indicates that there is a specific requirement for inhibition...|$|R
