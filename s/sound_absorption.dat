In the 1960s, he successfully developed {{a series of}} mufflers {{that could be used}} in industry environment.

After working out series of relationship between noise and brain, noise and deafness, noise and neurasthenia, he proposed noise standard for all places in industrial enterprise plants in China. His work led to the issue of the first China National Noise Standard for Industry in 1980.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{acoustical}} and nonacoustical properties of composites using corn husk fiber (CHF) and unsaturated polyester as the sound-absorbing materials. The {{influence of the}} volume fraction of CHF on acoustic performance was experimentally investigated. In addition, the nonacoustical properties, such as air-flow resistivity, porosity, and mechanical properties of composites have been analyzed. The {{results show that the}} <b>sound</b> <b>absorptions</b> at low frequencies are determined by the number of lumens in fiber, particularly the absorption coefficient, which increases the amount of fiber. For high-frequency <b>sound,</b> the <b>absorption</b> coefficient is determined by the arrangement of fibers in the composite. An absorption coefficient is close to zero when the fibers are arranged in a conventional pattern; however, when they are arranged in a random pattern, a high absorption coefficient can be obtained. The bond interface between the fiber and resin enhances its mechanical properties, which increases the longevity of the composite panel...|$|R

The work {{described}} in this thesis was directed towards studying signal processing techniques that could best be incorporated in an apparatus that was to measure the plane wave <b>sound</b> power <b>absorption</b> coefficient of road surfaces in-situ. Road traffic noise {{has been identified as}} the greatest noise pollutant in the industrialised world with the tyre/road interaction being the major source of noise for traffic speeds in excess of 50 km/hr. Open pore bitumen asphalt material has been found to present a sound absorbing surface that is able to contribute to the mitigation of road traffic noise. This has generated research into the production of sound absorbing road surface materials which, in turn, has generated a need for an apparatus that is able to measure the <b>sound</b> power <b>absorption</b> coefficient of such materials both in the laboratory and in the field. It was considered that the development of an easily transportable apparatus was needed which would enable a single, non-skilled operator to measure rapidly the normal incident <b>sound</b> power <b>absorption</b> coefficient, over a broad frequency band, of road surfaces, in-situ. This included, for example, the measurement of the absorption coefficient of open-pore asphalt materials developed in the laboratory, the measurement of newly laid surfaces, the comparison of different surfaces, as well as determining the effect of contamination, over time, of the pores of open-pore asphalt by ingress of dust...|$|R

It was used in such applications as electrical insulation for hotplate wiring and in building insulation. When asbestos is used for its resistance to fire or heat, the fibers are often mixed with cement or woven into fabric or mats. These desirable properties made asbestos very widely used.

On the above as background, this research studies the acoustics of Munakata St. Francisco Xavier Catholic Church.

On the basis of it, the authors examine how to improve the acoustics by a computer simulation, and propose some ideas reducing reverberations to improve speech intelligibility.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to compare the two well known room {{acoustical}} prediction software (CATT-Acoustics and Odeon) which use similar ray-based algorithms, but different scattering model. The comparisons between them were done by using the 3 D computer model of Zvolen castle’s countyard. Simulations were in both computer programs performed with the same input data, i. e. the dimensions of the model, the <b>sound</b> <b>absorptions</b> and values of the scattering coefficient of all model surfaces were set the same and set-up of the virtual loudspeaker and microphones was identical. During the analysis, the main attention was oriented on the prediction of the Reverberation Time (T 30), Sound Pressure Level (Lp) and Definition (D 50). Second comparison in this research was performed by using the Odeon software only, where the influence of the transition order TO value (TO= 0 to 3) was assessed. Differences between the software and TO number influence are shown not only in simulated values of acoustical quantities but also in the simulated impulse responses as such. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|While the C5 {{may have}} been {{initially}} criticized for using inexpensive materials and older technology (e.g., [...] composites in body panels and floor boards; an OHV engine; and leaf springs), ostensibly as cost-cutting measures, these components are actually very strong for their relatively light weight (low mass), or have proven reliability. The C5's modular body panels make excellent use of a lightweight composite material known in the automotive industry as SMC or Sheet Molded Composite, a type of fiberglass that is blended and bonded with plastics. SMC provides better protection against direct blows because it is very stiff and will not dent. The floor boards on the C5 are a composite sandwich of SMC with balsa wood in the middle. Balsa wood was chosen for its extreme stiffness, light weight and excellent <b>sound</b> <b>absorption</b> qualities. The all aluminium LS1 overhead valve engine is much lighter than its cast iron predecessor, the LT1, and provides for a much lower hoodline when compared to an overhead cam design of relative displacement. The composite leaf springs are much lighter and sit much lower than typical coil springs and help provide the C5 with its excellent ride characteristics and distinctive ride height.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that a large air space is needed for {{absorbing}} sound in low frequencies by using porous material. Therefore, porous material is neither realistic nor practical for use of absorbing walls or ceilings in a small room such as a living room in a house. With these points as background, the authors have examined the absorbing structure in low frequencies by applying resonator absorbers and presented that the combination of three types of resonators makes good absorptions at three resonance frequencies and closing the opening of resonator with porous material of small flow resistance broadens the band width of absorbing frequencies. These results imply that resonator absorbers might realize good <b>sound</b> <b>absorptions</b> in low frequencies. In this paper, for making the thickness of the structure thin, the effects of the shape of resonators and the place of porous material in the resonators on the absorbing characteristics are examined by a numerical simulation based on FDTDM.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the capability of neural network in predicting a classroom’s reverberation time. A classroom in Oita University was chosen as a sample to obtain the virtual data (reverberation time) based on 20 types of <b>sound</b> <b>absorptions</b> coefficients using Finite Element Method (FEM) and Sabine equation. The capability of FEM has shown that it is able to simulate virtual data in each location of a classroom. To develop a neural network model, virtual data (721 data) was taken from FEM for the learning process. The assessment was made by using testing subset (20 % from 721 data) to verify the performance. The testing’s means square error (MSE) was 3. 7751 × 10 - 4 and correlation coefficient (R 2) was 0. 992 approximately to 1. The optimum network used was 4 hidden nodes. Extended assessment was made using the unseen data (35 data) and it showed that neural network prediction was approximately close to the actual data with MSE is 4. 154 × 10 - 4. Basically, the capability of reverberation time prediction using neural network is shown in this paper.  </p...|$|R

40|$|A growing {{ecological}} awareness {{has led to}} a {{shift towards}} lightweight materials. These materials, however, come with an impaired NVH behaviour and thus require a smart design to meet the ever-increasing customer expectations and more stringent regulations.
