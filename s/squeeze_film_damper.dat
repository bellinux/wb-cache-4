40|$|There {{are various}} energy {{dissipation}} mechanisms {{that affect the}} dynamic response of microstructures used in MEMS devices. A cumulative effect of such losses is captured by an important characteristic of the structure called Quality factor or Q-factor. Estimating Q-factor {{at the design stage}} is crucial in all applications that use dynamics as their principle mode of operation. A high Q-factor indicates sharp resonance that, in turn, can indicate a broad flat response region of the structure. In addition, a high Q-factor typically indicates a high sensitivity. Microstructures used in MEMS are generally required to have much higher Q-factors than their macro counterparts. However some damping mechanisms present in microstructures can reduce the Q-factor of the structure significantly. In the present work, we investigate the dependence of Q-factor on the <b>squeeze</b> <b>film</b> <b>damping</b> an energy dissipation mechanism that dominates by a couple of orders of magnitude over other losses when a fluid (e. g., air) is squeezed through gaps due to vibrations of a microstructure.

40|$|A {{triaxial}} accelerometer is presented which employs as its proof mass a mechanically free micromachined disc that is electrostatically levitated. Air damping plays {{a critical role}} in the operation of the accelerometer, providing stability to an inherently unstable system. Systems that operate beyond the cut-off frequency, however, suffer reduced gain due to the spring component of the <b>squeeze</b> <b>film</b> <b>damping,</b> resulting in decreased sensitivity. A finite-element model for extracting <b>squeeze</b> <b>film</b> <b>damping</b> coefficients for transverse and rotational motion of the disc, via an analogy to heat transfer theory, is presented. The use of the analogy enables a reduction of the problem from a complex three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics domain to a two-dimensional heat transfer domain. The model is used to evaluate the effect of including damping holes in the proof mass. The high-frequency oscillation and physical size of the proof mass dictate that the accelerometer is operated well beyond its cut-off frequency and so the inclusion of damping holes in the proof mass can result in an increase rather than decrease in the damping coefficient.

40|$|Many MEMS devices employ {{parallel}} plates for capacitive sensing and actuation. The {{desire to}} get {{a significant change in}} capacitance has been pushing the need to reduce the gap between the moving plate and the fixed plate. With fabrication processes making rapid strides, it is now possible to push the gap to be so small that it becomes comparable to the mean free path of gas or air molecules present in the gap. In all MEMS devices, where the essential function of the device depends on the dynamics of the mechanical components, the presence of air or a gas in such narrow gaps leads to energy dissipation if the gas is squeezed between the two plates due to transverse motion of the movable plate. This energy dissipation, known as <b>squeeze</b> <b>film</b> <b>damping,</b> plays a critical role in determining the quality factor of such devices. For many devices, simple approximation of <b>squeeze</b> <b>film</b> <b>damping</b> based on the linearized Reynolds equation is sufficient. However, under moderate vacuum and very narrow gaps, the linearized Reynolds equation does not give satisfactory results, especially if large amplitude motions of the movable plate are desired.

The relations thus obtained can be used for any flexural mode of vibration of the resonators. We validate the analytical formulae by comparing the results with numerical simulations carried out using coupled finite element analysis in ANSYS, as well as experimentally measured values from MEMS cantilever resonators of various sizes vibrating in different modes. The analytically predicted values of damping are, in the worst case, within less than 10 % of the values obtained experimentally or numerically.

40|$|Abstract — Smart fluid {{technology}} is an emerging {{field of research}} {{that leads to the}} introduction of Electro-rheological (ER) fluids. ER fluids are such smart materials whose rheological properties (viscosity, yield stress, shear modulus etc.) can be readily controlled upon external electric field. The use of ER fluids introduces a new philosophy {{on the fact that the}} stiffness and damping can be changed by applying high electric field and thus minimizing the vibration of the structure during normal operation. In the rotor vibration control of high speed engines squeeze film dampers are currently used. The dynamic characteristics (stiffness and damping) of a <b>squeeze</b> <b>film</b> <b>damper</b> lubricated with electro-rheological fluids are important in many practical engineering applications are studied for high accuracy and efficiency. The Reynolds equation of hydro-dynamic lubrication is normally used to determine the dynamic characteristics in the analysis of rotor dynamic system with <b>squeeze</b> <b>film</b> <b>damper,</b> which neglect the inertia effects. At high speeds both inertia and visco-elasticity introduce phase shifting effects into the fluid motion. As a result, prediction derived from Reynolds equation can be significantly in error. Here an improved expression is developed for the dynamic characteristic in terms of Reynolds’s number for a particular electro-rheological fluid. Bingham model has been used to describe the behavior of the electro-rheological fluids. The result leads to improvements and explain why it is significant to include fluid inertia forces which have large effects on dynamic characteristics.
