25|$|In his 1825 annual {{message to}} Congress, Adams {{presented}} a comprehensive and ambitious agenda. He called for major investments in internal improvements {{as well as}} the creation of a national university, a naval academy, and a national astronomical observatory. Noting the healthy status of the treasury and the possibility for more revenue via land sales, Adams argued for the completion of several projects that were in various stages of construction or planning, including a road from Washington to New Orleans. He proposed the establishment of a Department of the Interior as a new cabinet-level department that would preside over these internal improvements. Adams's programs faced opposition from various quarters. Many disagreed with his broad interpretation of the constitution, and favored stronger state governments {{at the expense of the}} federal government. Others disliked any government interference and were opposed to central planning. Some in the South feared that Adams was secretly an abolitionist and that he sought to <b>suborn</b> the states to the federal government.|$|E

25|$|Ulster: The Ulaid proper {{were in a}} sorry state {{all during}} this era, being {{squeezed}} between the emergent Ó Neill of Tír Eógain in the west, the MacDonnells, Clann Aodha Buidhe, and the Anglo-Normans from the east. Only Mag Aonghusa managed to retain {{a portion of their}} former kingdom with expansion into Iveagh. The two great success stories of this era were Ó Domhnaill of Tír Chonaill and Ó Neill of Tír Eógain. Ó Domhnaill was able to dominate much of northern Connacht to the detriment of its native lords, both Old English and Gaelic, though it took time to <b>suborn</b> the likes of Ó Conchobhair Sligigh and Ó Raghallaigh of Iar Breifne. Expansion southwards brought the hegemony of Tír Eógain, and by extension Ó Neill influence, well into the border lordships of Louth and Meath. Mag Uidir of Fear Manach would slightly later be able to build his lordship up to that of third most powerful in the province, {{at the expense of the}} Ó Raghallaigh of Iar Breifne and the MacMahons of Airgíalla.|$|E
500|$|Propelled by {{his belief}} in the Enlightenment, soon after taking power, Joseph {{launched}} a number of reforms which he hoped would make the territories he controlled more efficient and easier to govern. From 1784, Joseph launched a number of [...] "radical and wide-ranging" [...] reforms in the fields of economics, politics and religion aimed at institutions which he judged outdated. Some have drawn parallels between Joseph's rule in the Holy Roman Empire and that of Philip II in the Netherlands as both attempted to <b>suborn</b> local traditions in order to achieve more effective central rule. Like Philip, Joseph's perceived attacks on important institutions succeeded in uniting multiple divergent social classes against him.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the death}} of Emperor Manuel I in 1180 the {{succession}} fell to his son Alexios II Komnenos. As Alexios was a child, power devolved on his mother, the empress Maria of Antioch. Her rule proved unpopular, especially with the aristocracy who resented her Latin (Western) origins. [...] When Manuel’s cousin Andronikos Komnenos (Andronikos I) made a bid for power in early 1182 he wrote to John Vatatzes {{in an attempt to}} <b>suborn</b> him. Vatatzes recognised Andronikos as a potential tyrant and wrote back in insulting terms. Vatazes' cousin Andronikos Kontostephanos the commander of the navy, however, was deceived and {{played a key role in}} allowing Andronikos' forces to enter Constantinople. Once in power, Andronikos Komnenos proved that he had indeed a tyrannical nature and a vehement desire to break the power and influence of the Byzantine aristocratic families.|$|E
2500|$|Heather Ousby {{points out}} that the {{identity}} of the [...] "subbornd Informer" [...] has proved especially contentious for critics. She points to several interpretations of the informer which include the Friend, some sort of spy, and [...] "an abstract force such as jealousy". In her interpretation of the Sonnet, Ousby settles on the idea that the informer represents the Friend. She bases this thought on the various meanings of the word [...] "suborn" [...] during this time period. Rather than spying, informing could also be seen as inspiring and thus it would refer to the inspiration for the sonnet. Likewise, the term <b>suborn</b> meant corruption in loyalty which the Speaker accuses the Friend of in other sonnets. Ousby is making a case for eliminating the informer as some third party, much like Greene. The difference is that Ousby uses the subtraction of this would-be character to shift the tone of the sonnet. She agrees that the first two quatrains concern how the [...] "dwellers on form and favor are destroyed by that humiliating process" [...] of giving unreciprocated affection. She sees the third quatrain as a plea to the Friend or as a directive to both of them. The couplet, however, becomes a means of stating the Speaker's independence from the Friend due to his [...] "poor but free" [...] oblations which mean a lot but cost so little. For Ousby, the Speaker seems to be separating himself from a disloyal patron who demeans his work.|$|E

To this the Emperor consented, seeking to mask the unscrupulous deed by a pitiful sophism.

He lacked for words in which to present his proposal, and he was afraid lest the man should resent it, and in a fit of indignation attack him with his partisan. He little imagined that Aventano had been forewarned by Ercole that a bribe would be offered him and that he was to accept it promptly. Ercole had chosen this man because he was intelligent, and had made him understand enough of what was toward, besides offering a substantial reward if he played his part well, and Aventano waited. But Gonzaga, knowing naught of this, abandoned at the last moment the notion of bribing him--which Ercole had enjoined him, and which he in his turn had promised Ercole was the course he would pursue.|$|E
