60|$|I {{scarcely}} {{consider myself}} {{to have seen}} any thing of art in England. The calls of the living world were so various and exigeant, I had so little leisure for reflection, that, although I saw many paintings, I could not study them; and many times I saw them {{in a state of}} the nervous system too jaded and depressed to receive the full force of the impression. A day or two before I left, I visited the National Gallery, and made a rapid survey of its contents. There were two of Turner's masterpieces there, which he presented on the <b>significant</b> <b>condition</b> that they should hang side by side with their two finest Claudes. I thought them all four fine pictures, but I liked the Turners best. Yet I did not think any of them fine enough to form an absolute limit to human improvement. But, till I had been in Paris a day or two, perfectly secluded, at full liberty to think and rest, I did not feel that my time for examining art had really come.|$|E
50|$|A <b>significant</b> <b>condition</b> {{could be}} an {{electric}} current (voltage, or power level), an optical power level, a phase value, or a particular frequency or wavelength. The duration of a <b>significant</b> <b>condition</b> is the time interval between successive significant instants. A change from one <b>significant</b> <b>condition</b> to another is called a signal transition. Information can be transmitted either during the given time interval, or encoded as {{the presence or absence}} of a change in the received signal.|$|E
5000|$|In telecommunication, a n-ary code is a {{code that}} has n <b>significant</b> <b>conditions,</b> where n is a {{positive}} integer greater than 1. The integer substituted for n indicates the specific number of <b>significant</b> <b>conditions,</b> i.e., quantization states, in the code. For example, an 8-ary code has eight <b>significant</b> <b>conditions</b> and can convey three bits per code symbol. A prefix that indicates an integer, e.g., [...] "bin", [...] "tern," [...] or [...] "quatern", {{may be used in}} lieu of a numeral, to produce [...] "binary", [...] "ternary", or [...] "quaternary" [...] (2, 3, and 4 states respectively).|$|R

50|$|In telecommunication, a non-return-to-zero (NRZ) {{line code}} is a binary code in {{which ones are}} {{represented}} by one <b>significant</b> <b>condition,</b> usually a positive voltage, while zeros are represented by some other <b>significant</b> <b>condition,</b> usually a negative voltage, with no other neutral or rest condition. The pulses in NRZ have more energy than a return-to-zero (RZ) code, which also has an additional rest state beside the conditions for ones and zeros. NRZ is not inherently a self-clocking signal, so some additional synchronization technique must be used for avoiding bit slips; examples of such techniques are a run-length-limited constraint and a parallel synchronization signal.|$|E
50|$|In telegraphy, frequency-exchange {{signaling}} or two-source frequency keying is frequency-change signaling {{in which}} the change from one <b>significant</b> <b>condition</b> to another is accompanied by decay in amplitude {{of one or more}} frequencies and by buildup in amplitude of one or more other frequencies.|$|E

40|$|Amphetamine-induced place {{conditioning}} {{was evaluated}} in mice using a newly designed apparatus. It was demonstrated that this apparatus provides a neutral set of cues devoid of rewarding or aversive properties and can reveal place preference or aversion after pairings with drugs (amphetamine and morphine for preference and naloxone for aversion) known to produce such effects. Moreover, repeated pairings of environmental cues with either 2 or 3 mg/kg d-amphetamine resulted in <b>significant</b> <b>conditioned</b> place preference on a drug free test, whilst repeated pairings {{with a lower}} dose of the drug (1 mg/kg) resulted in <b>significant</b> <b>conditioned</b> place aversion. Finally, {{a small number of}} mice showed opposite responses in comparison with group means at low as well as at high doses of amphetamine.

50|$|A symbol may be {{described}} as either a pulse in digital baseband transmission or a tone in passband transmission using modems. A symbol is a waveform, a state or a <b>significant</b> <b>condition</b> of the communication channel that persists, for a fixed period of time. A sending device places symbols on the channel at a fixed and known symbol rate, and the receiving device has the job of detecting the sequence of symbols in order to reconstruct the transmitted data. There may be a direct correspondence between a symbol and a small unit of data. For example, each symbol may encode one or several binary digits or 'bits'. The data may also be represented by the transitions between symbols, or even by a sequence of many symbols.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{explored}} elicitation and habituation of the orienting reflex (OR) {{in the context of}} indifferent and significant stimuli, particularly aiming to clarify the mechanism driving dishabituation. An in-depth analysis of the mechanisms of electrodermal habituation and dishabituation was conducted, focusing on the role of state measures as determinants of the phasic response profile. Twenty-four young adult participants completed an auditory dishabituation task while electrodermal activity was recorded. Participants listened to a series of 10 innocuous tones of the same frequency (standards), followed by a deviant tone of a different frequency, and succeeded by 2 ÃÂ¿ 4 tones of the same frequency as the initial 10 stimuli. All stimuli had a random stimulus onset asynchrony of 5 ÃÂ¿ 7 s. Participants completed an indifferent condition in which there was no task in relation to the stimuli, and a <b>significant</b> <b>condition</b> where instruction was given to count the stimuli silently; order was counterbalanced between participants. As predicted, both skin conductance responses (SCRs) and skin conductance levels (SCLs) were larger for the significant than the indifferent condition. The initial phasic ORs were dependent on pre-stimulus arousal level, and there were significant decreases in both SCR and SCL over the first 10 standards in both conditions. Phasic response recovery was apparent to the deviant stimulus, and dishabituation to the following standard stimulus; both effects were enhanced in the <b>significant</b> <b>condition.</b> Sensitisation was apparent in SCL following the initial and deviant stimuli, but the extent of this was confounded with incomplete resolution of the preceding phasic OR in the <b>significant</b> <b>condition.</b> In the indifferent condition, dishabituation was independent of deviant-related sensitisation; this could not be tested in the <b>significant</b> <b>condition.</b> These findings suggest that dishabituation is not a process of sensitisation, but rather, a disruption of the habituation process...|$|E
