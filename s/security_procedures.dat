5|$|Germany {{was criticized}} {{severely}} {{by the international}} press for lax security measures in Frankfurt Airport that allowed Demeke to smuggle a pistol on board, and for allowing the hijacked aircraft to leave after refueling in Hannover. Frankfurt Airport, the busiest airport in Europe at the time, had recently come under fire after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, when it had been alleged that the explosives had been loaded in Frankfurt. Since the 1988 bombing, the Frankfurt airport had performed numerous security reviews and implemented more stringent <b>security</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|E
5|$|On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen {{issued its}} {{report on the}} matter. It was sharply {{critical}} of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt <b>security</b> <b>procedures</b> to a deteriorating security environment. It focused its criticism on the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence. Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.|$|E

30|$|The drivers {{considered}} {{certain parts}} of the <b>security</b> <b>procedure</b> closely aligned to their primary role as a train driver, and therefore were self-motivated to make no errors in those parts of the procedure. One driver described the task of stopping the train at the station as follows: “I have to stop the train at exactly the right spot on the track dozens of times every day. It is something that I {{should be able to do}} without error even in my sleep. It is a basic part of train driving irrespective of whether it is part of a <b>security</b> <b>procedure</b> or not”.|$|R

25|$|Israel's use of {{comprehensive}} closures decreased {{over the next}} few years. In 1998, Israel implemented new policies to ease <b>security</b> <b>procedures</b> and allow somewhat freer movement of Gazan goods and labor into Israel. These changes led to three years of economic recovery in the Gaza Strip, disrupted by the outbreak of the al-Aqsa Intifada {{in the last quarter of}} 2000. Before the second Palestinian uprising in September 2000, around 25,000 workers from the Gaza Strip (about 2% of the population) worked in Israel on a daily basis.|$|E

Most of the county's 20,000 employees returned to work on December 7, 2015, though Inland Regional Center personnel worked remotely. The Inland Regional Center remained closed until January 4, 2016. Its two main buildings now operated under heightened security; the building where the attack took place will remain closed indefinitely. The location of a planned train station next to the Center was moved eastward {{due in part to the}} Center's new <b>security</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|E
25|$|At Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, plainclothes {{agents and}} fully armed police or {{military}} personnel patrol the premises for explosives, suspicious behavior, and other threats. Armed security personnel also patrol El Al terminals overseas. Inside the terminal, passengers and their baggage are checked by a trained team. El Al <b>security</b> <b>procedures</b> require that all passengers be interviewed individually prior to boarding, allowing El Al staff to identify possible security threats. Passengers are {{asked questions about}} their place of origin, the reason for their trip, their job or occupation, and whether they have packed their bags themselves. El Al believes interviewers can spot signs of nervousness.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} the four {{measures}} aimed at increasing the dependability of Vietnamese soldiers which also aimed at achieving the right ethnic proportion of troops at each garrison. The lack of European troops at Yen Bai – aside from Massimi's and Le Tacon's personal failures – had been pinpointed {{as the cause of}} the mutiny. The proposal held that if the local commanding officer had more European troops at his disposal, their presence would have deterred the Vietnamese soldiers from taking part in the mutiny. Although this was plausible in that {{one of the leaders of}} the mutiny had attempted to foment his Vietnamese colleagues by pointing to the weak French presence, this internal argument overlooked the haphazard command and <b>security</b> <b>procedures</b> that had left Yen Bai vulnerable.|$|E

They feel the pressure of maintaining punctuality while performing security tasks. In that sense like safety, drivers perceive security too as an “eternal killjoy” [51, p. 114].|$|R
25|$|After check-in, all {{checked baggage}} is {{screened}} using sophisticated X-ray and CT scanners {{and put in}} a pressure chamber to trigger any possible explosive devices. Following the check-in process, passengers continue to personal security and passport control. Before passing through the metal detectors and putting carry-on baggage through the X-ray machine at the security checkpoint, passports and boarding passes are re-inspected and additional questions may be asked. Before boarding the aircraft, passports and boarding passes are verified once again. <b>Security</b> <b>procedures</b> for incoming flights are not as stringent, but passengers may be questioned by passport control depending on country of origin, or countries visited prior to arrival in Israel. Passengers who have recently visited countries at war with Israel (all Arab countries except Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Mauritania and Qatar) will be subject to further questioning.|$|E
25|$|From Helsfyr {{the line}} {{continued}} {{to the city}} center via the Vålerenga Line and the Gamlebyen Line. The Lambertseter Line was the first suburban line operated by Oslo Sporveier, and therefore the company copied the <b>security</b> <b>procedures</b> of Bærumsbanen, that operated the Kolsås Line and the Østensjø Line. The first operation on the Lambertseter Line with the SM53 trams was on 10 April 1957, after technical trials had been conducted with the Gullfisk trams. Travel time from Jernbanetorget to Bergkrystallen was 28 minutes. The official opening took place on 28 April. The lines were trafficked with SM53-trams {{that had been in}} service up to five years with the company, and were bought specifically in mind to be able to operate the suburban line, in addition to street lines. In addition, school trams were operated with Gullfisk. At first, the Lambertseter Line was made part of Line 4, that connected onwards along the Kolsås Line. This was later changed so it only operated to Vognmannsgata from 19 June 1960. From 24 June 1963, the trams terminated at Jernbanetorget. Starting in September 1960, the loop at Ryan was taken out of service, and a depot for the metro was started built at the site.|$|E
