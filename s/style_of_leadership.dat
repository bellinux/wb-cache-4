The changes are also related to the professional leadership, which needs to ensure that employees do the required work and fulfill business objectives, while, at the other hand, their satisfaction and self-realization should be achieved, as well. In order to achieve these objectives, managers need to approach employees in a proper manner.

5|$|Just as the Germans {{had made}} the halt decision, the Soviet Kalinin, Western and Southwestern Fronts {{launched}} a massive counteroffensive, aimed at driving Army Group Centre back from Moscow. The attacks were especially strong against Third Panzer Group, which had made some of the closest penetrations to the city. In three weeks of confused, savage fighting, Reinhardt extricated his troops from potential encirclement and fell back to the Lama River line. Placed in charge of covering the retreat, Model's harsh, almost brutal, <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> now paid dividends as panic threatened to infect the German columns. On several occasions, he restored order at a congested crossroads with a drawn pistol, but the retreat never became a rout.|$|E
5|$|The Greek forces were, {{as agreed}} by the Allied congress, under the overall command of Spartan royalty {{in the person of}} Pausanias, who was the regent for Leonidas' young son, Pleistarchus, his cousin. Diodorus tells us that the Athenian {{contingent}} was under the command of Aristides; it is probable that the other contingents also had their leaders. Herodotus tells us in several places that the Greeks held council during the prelude to the battle, implying that decisions were consensual and that Pausanias did not have the authority to issue direct orders to the other contingents. This <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> contributed to the way events unfolded during the battle itself. For instance, in the period immediately before the battle, Pausanias was unable to order the Athenians to join up with his forces, and thus the Greeks fought the battle completely separated from each other.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the effect <b>of</b> two <b>leadership</b> <b>styles,</b> namely: transformational and bureaucratic <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> as practiced by head teachers {{on the quality}} of support supervision they offer primary teachers in Mid-western Uganda. The study arose as a result of public outcry over the poor quality and limited amount of support supervision teachers in primary schools in that region of the country are offered despite numerous attempts by Government to train school heads in institutional management. The researchers employed a descriptive cross-sectional survey research design where quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 320 teachers and 20 educational administrators using questionnaire survey and interview methods. The data were analyzed with the use of descriptive and inferential statistical techniques as well as content analysis method. The findings of the study revealed that both transformational (B=. 365; p=. 000) and bureaucratic (B =. 250; p=. 000) <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> significantly affect the quality of support supervision that head teachers offer teachers. Overall, the study established that, together, the two <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> (R=. 671; R 2 =. 45; Sig. =. 000) account for 45 percent variations in the quality of teacher support supervision offered by head teachers, other factors notwithstanding. It was, thus, concluded that any leadership style head teachers employ that involves subordinates in decision-making or brings about change, would have a positive bearing on the kind of support supervision they can offer teachers; and therefore, the researchers recommend that school heads should be conscious of the choice <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>styles</b> they use while heading a school...|$|R
