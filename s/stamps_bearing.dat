He also hoped to profit from sales of special postage <b>stamps</b> <b>bearing</b> the cancellation stamp of the Antarctica post office that Shackleton, appointed temporary postmaster by the New Zealand government, intended to establish there. None of these schemes produced the anticipated riches, although the post office was set up at Cape Royds and used as a conduit for the expedition's mail.|$|E

25|$|Dr. David Amit of the Israel Antiquities Authority, who {{has made}} a study of bread stamps {{explained}} the find; “A potter engraved the menorah image in the surface of the stamp prior to firing it in a kiln, whereas the owner’s name was engraved in the stamp’s handle after firing. Hence we can assume that a series of <b>stamps</b> <b>bearing</b> the menorah symbol were produced for Jewish bakers, and each of these bakers carved his name on the handle, which also served as a stamp.|$|E
25|$|Soviet {{banknotes}} {{were used}} in the Trans-Dniester Moldavian Republic after its formation in 1990. When the former Soviet republics began issuing their own currencies, Transnistria was flooded with Soviet rubles. In an attempt to protect its financial system, in July 1993 the Transnistrian government bought used Goznak-printed Soviet and Russian notes dated 1961–1992 which it modified by applying adhesive <b>stamps</b> <b>bearing</b> the image of General Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov, founder of Tiraspol and its corresponding denomination. These stamped notes replaced unstamped Soviet and Russian notes at par. It is thought that most uncirculated notes bearing these stickers were created after 1994 specifically for collectors.|$|E
25|$|Engraved {{portrayals of}} U.S. presidents {{were the only}} designs found on U.S. postage from 1847 until 1869, with the one {{exception}} of Benjamin Franklin, whose historical stature was {{comparable to that of}} a president, although his appearance was also an acknowledgement of his role as the first U. S. Postmaster General. During this period, the U.S. Post Office issued various postage <b>stamps</b> <b>bearing</b> the depictions of George Washington foremost, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln, the last of whom first appeared in 1866, one year after his death. After twenty-two years of issuing stamps with only presidents and Franklin, the Post Office in 1869 issued a series of eleven postage stamps that were generally regarded by the American public as being abruptly different from the previous issues and whose designs were considered at the time to be a break from the tradition of honoring American forefathers on the nation's postage stamps. These new issues had other nonpresidential subjects and a design style that was also different, one issue bearing a horse, another a locomotive, while others were depicted with nonpresidential themes. Washington and Lincoln were to be found only once in this series of eleven stamps, which some considered to be below par in design and image quality. As a result, this pictographic series was met with general disdain and proved so unpopular that the issues were consequently sold for only one year where remaining stocks were pulled from post offices across the United States.|$|E

500|$|Palestinian {{children}} were distressed by the repeated broadcasting of the footage, {{according to a}} therapist in Gaza, and were re-enacting the scene in playgrounds. Arab countries issued postage <b>stamps</b> <b>bearing</b> the images. Parks and streets were named in Muhammad's honour, and Osama bin Laden mentioned him in a [...] "warning" [...] to President George Bush after 9/11. The images were blamed for the 2000 Ramallah lynching and a rise in antisemitism in France. One image {{could be seen in}} the background when journalist Daniel Pearl, an American Jew, was beheaded by al-Qaeda in February 2002.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the initial Epaulettes series {{inspired}} the introduction of three new varieties with different designs and denominations in October 1849. These new types replaced the epaulettes design with the so-called [...] "Medallion" [...] (Médaillon) type, featuring Leopold I's portrait within a circular medallion window. In the same issue, a new denomination of forty centimes in red was produced for overseas mail. It was rumoured {{at the time that}} Leopold I did not like the design at the time, and believed that the epaulettes gave him a childlike aspect. The Epaulettes were officially superseded in 1859, but remained legally valid until 1 July 1866 when, following Leopold I's death, all <b>stamps</b> <b>bearing</b> his effigy were demonetised.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson has {{appeared}} on 13 different U.S. postage stamps. Only George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Benjamin Franklin have appeared more often. He first appeared on an 1863 2-Cent stamp, which is commonly referred to by collectors as the Black Jack due to the large portraiture of Jackson on its face printed in pitch black. During the American Civil War the Confederate government also issued two Confederate postage <b>stamps</b> <b>bearing</b> Jackson's portrait, one a [...] {{and the other a}} , both issued in 1863.|$|E
2500|$|Air letter sheets (or {{air letter}} cards {{as they were}} then known) were first {{introduced}} in Palestine in November 1944. [...] During the volatility of 1947 and 1948, British postal services deteriorated and were replaced by ad hoc interim services prior to the partition {{and the establishment of}} the State of Israel. Just before the formal end to the British Mandate over Palestine, the Mandatory government destroyed the existing stocks of postage stamps and had Palestine removed from the World Postal Union. A total of 104 <b>stamps</b> <b>bearing</b> the name [...] "Palestine" [...] were issued by the British between 1918 and 1942.|$|E

2500|$|Maximilian's Empire {{was never}} {{in control of the}} entire country and was in {{constant}} battle with Republican forces led by the ousted president Benito Juárez. [...] Juárez eventually set up a government in exile in Chihuahua. [...] Parts of the country not in control of the regency would not use <b>stamps</b> <b>bearing</b> Maximilian's image and issued a few provisional stamps. [...] More commonly those areas reverted to using pre-stamp postal markings with [...] "franco" [...] stamps. [...] These stampless covers issued after the advent of adhesive stamps are known to philatelists of Mexico as [...] "Sellos Negro", [...] or [...] "Black (hand)stamps".|$|E
2500|$|During the British Mandate, {{postage stamps}} and {{services}} {{were provided by}} British authorities. At first using temporary stamps issued in February 1918 by the British Expeditionary Forces in Palestine, and in February 1920 issuing permanent <b>stamps</b> <b>bearing</b> the imprint: [...] "Palestine Eretz Israel." [...] From 1933 to 1948, mandate services included airmail stamps and, as an innovation, air letter cards. British postal offices and operations were, in part, {{turned over to the}} Israeli government. In May 1948, as the British withdrew and postal services broke down, the provisional government issued overprints on Jewish National Fund stamps and ad hoc postage was created in Nahariya and Safed.|$|E
2500|$|Vidkun Quisling proclaimed himself prime {{minister}} and appointed a government with members from the National Unity Party. He was quickly set aside and replaced by Josef Terboven, but reinstated in 1942. The Norwegian Campaign continued in Northern Norway and the government fled to London on 7 June. The German occupation resulted in a brutalization of society and 30,000 people were imprisoned. 55,000 people joined the National Unity Party, which became the only legal party. But the nazification process failed after the Supreme Court resigned and both organized sports and bishops boycotted the new regime. A resistance movement was established and became coordinate from London from 1943. Stokker reports that hostile humour against the Germans helped maintain morale and build a wall against collaboration. Jokes made the rounds dripping with contempt for the oppressors, ridicule of Nazi ideology, stressing the cruelty of the Nazis and mocking their inflated self-image. People on the street asked, [...] "Do you {{know the difference between}} the Nazis and a bucket of manure? The bucket." [...] In Post Office lines they explained, [...] "It's rumored that we're getting new <b>stamps</b> <b>bearing</b> Quisling's likeness, but distribution has been delayed because no one knows which side to spit on." [...] The jokes worked to educate Norwegians about the occupation, and encourage a sense of solidarity. At the time of German surrender on 8 May 1945, there were 360,000 German soldiers in the country.|$|E
