50|$|Two {{types of}} photometers are used: {{spectrophotometer}} and filter photometer. In <b>spectrophotometers</b> a <b>monochromator</b> (<b>with</b> prism or with grating) {{is used to}} obtain monochromatic light of one defined wavelength. In filter photometers, optical filters are used to give the monochromatic light. Spectrophotometers can thus easily be set to measure the absorbance at different wavelengths, and {{they can also be}} used to scan the spectrum of the absorbing substance. They are in this way more flexible than filter photometers, also give a higher optical purity of the analyzing light, and therefore they are preferably used for research purposes. Filter photometers are cheaper, robuster and easier to use and therefore they are used for routine analysis. Photometers for microtiter plates are filter photometers.|$|R
