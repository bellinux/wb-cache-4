5|$|Of its seven sacraments the Eucharist is the {{principal}} one, celebrated liturgically in the Mass. The church teaches that through consecration by a priest the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ. Virgin Mary is venerated in the Catholic Church as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven, honoured in dogmas and devotions. Its teaching includes sanctification through faith and evangelisation of the Gospel and Catholic <b>social</b> <b>teaching,</b> which emphasises support for the sick, the poor, and the afflicted through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy. The Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of {{education and health care}} in the world.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to find out the views of the first-year {{students}} studying at the department of <b>social</b> studies <b>teaching</b> on <b>social</b> studies education at the beginning of their undergraduate program and to investigate how the orientation program introducing <b>social</b> studies <b>teaching</b> affected these students. For that reason, first year students attending Akdeniz University, Faculty of Education, Department of <b>Social</b> Studies <b>Teaching,</b> participated in the study in the first week of 2011 - 2012 academic year. A scale consisting of open-ended questions was applied to the students in the study. Then, out of four first grade <b>social</b> studies <b>teaching</b> classes, two classes were randomly chosen. An orientation program introducing <b>social</b> studies <b>teaching</b> was applied to one of these classes. 30 students randomly chosen from these two classes were interviewed at the end of 2011 - 2012 academic year. The data was analyzed by content analysis. According to the results of the study, it can be suggested that <b>social</b> studies <b>teaching</b> department freshmen have no awareness of the contents and aims of <b>social</b> studies <b>teaching,</b> do not recognize social studies and disciplines completely and have biased opinions about <b>social</b> studies <b>teaching.</b> Following the orientation program applied to the students, it is possible to assert that the views of students participated in the orientation program regarding <b>social</b> studies <b>teaching</b> changed more significantly in a positive way than the views of those who did not participate in the orientation program...|$|R

The 22 departments (if these are added to 16 which refer to the medical care area) are aimed to promote and coordinate the {{activities of}} institutional research {{and contribute to the}} organization of doctoral research (PhD). The atheneum centers were established in 2007 and have structures for the conception, development, and implementation of research projects and training on social issues.

He {{was the first}} chancellor (top official) of the FRG, 1949–63, and until his death was the founder {{and leader of the}} Christian Democratic Union (CDU), a coalition of conservatives, ordoliberals, and adherents of Protestant and Catholic <b>social</b> <b>teaching</b> that dominated West Germany politics for most of its history. During his chancellorship, the West Germany economy grew quickly, and West Germany established friendly relations with France, participated in the emerging European Union, established the country's armed forces (the Bundeswehr), and became a pillar of NATO as well as firm ally of the United States. Adenauer's government also commenced the long process of reconciliation with the Jews and Israel after the Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|Catholic <b>social</b> <b>{{teaching}}</b> {{is based}} on the teaching of Jesus and commits Catholics to the welfare of others. Although the Catholic Church operates numerous social ministries throughout the world, individual Catholics are also required to practice spiritual and corporal works of mercy. Corporal works of mercy include feeding the hungry, welcoming strangers, immigrants or refugees, clothing the naked, taking care of the sick and visiting those in prison. Spiritual works require the Catholic to share their knowledge with others, to give advice to those who need it, comfort those who suffer, have patience, forgive those who hurt them, give correction to those who need it, and pray for the living and the dead. The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick, however, is performed by a priest, who will anoint with oil the head and hands of the ill person and pray a special prayer for them while laying on hands.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the passing}} of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), it has become {{increasingly}} difficult to <b>teach</b> for <b>social</b> justice in urban schools. The post-NCLB era has led to standardized and narrowed curriculum that has pushed equity based instruction to the margins. The study examined, how educators sustained and enhanced <b>social</b> justice <b>teaching</b> in urban secondary schools through a critical inquiry group (CIG). A qualitative case study methodology and critical inquiry group design was utilized to investigate six participants across the teaching experience spectrum. Research methods included participant observations, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis. The study had three key findings; the first finding revealed that the CIG structured a community of transformative praxis. Secondly, the participants’ collaboration within the CIG involved trust, vulnerability, and accountability. The last finding described that all of the participants, regardless of years of <b>teaching</b> experience, employed <b>social</b> justice <b>teaching</b> and further suggests that <b>social</b> justice <b>teaching</b> is a process...|$|R
