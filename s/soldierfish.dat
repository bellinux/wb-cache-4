5|$|A {{sedentary}} ambush predator, the Pacific angelshark feeds {{mainly on}} bony fishes, including kelp bass, croakers, flatfishes, damselfishes, mackerels, and sardines. During {{the winter and}} early spring, spawning squid are abundant and become {{the primary source of}} food. In the southern Gulf of California, the most important prey species are, in descending order, the mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, the toadfish Porichthys analis, the lizardfish Synodus evermann, the <b>soldierfish</b> Myripristis leiognathus, and the shrimp Sicyonia penicillata. At Catalina Island, this species feeds mainly on the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis) and the queenfish (Seriphus politus). Adults and juveniles have similar diets.|$|E

This study was conducted from August 2010 to January 2013. The specimens had been collected mostly by hand-line and small trawl operated by local fisherman and were purchased in Rajawali Fish Landing Port and Paotere Fish Landing Port and fish markets in Makassar. Results showed that 14 species representing three genera inhabiting the area were examined and identified: Myripristis adusta, M. berndti, M. hexagonatus, M. kuntee, M. violacea, M. pralinea, Neoniphon opercularis, N. sammara, N. argenteus, Sargocentron caudimaculatum, S. diadema, S. cornutum, S. spineferum, S. voilaceum. The Common name available of each species was given. Key words: <b>Soldierfishes,</b> Holocentridae, Spermonde, South Sulawes...|$|R
40|$|Three {{species of}} Myripristid fishes {{identified}} as Myripristis seychellensis, M. formosa and M. greenfieldi {{were collected from}} Indian waters. This adds to the already existing six species of <b>soldierfishes</b> Myripristis adusta, M. berndti, M. botche, M. hexagona, M. murdjan and M. violacea recorded from Indian and Andaman waters. Since these three fishes are new distributional records for Indian waters, meristic counts, body measurements and descriptions of the specimens are presented...|$|R

40|$|Squirrelfishes and <b>soldierfishes</b> (Holocentridae) {{are among}} the most {{conspicuous}} species in the nocturnal reef fish community. However, there is no clear consensus regarding their evolutionary relationships, which is reflected in a complicated taxonomic history. We collected DNA sequence data from multiple single copy nuclear genes and one mitochondrial gene sampled from over fifty percent of the recognized holocentrid species and infer the first species-level phylogeny of the Holocentridae. Our results strongly support the monophyly of the clades Myripristinae (<b>soldierfishes)</b> and Holocentrinae (squirrelfishes). The molecular phylogenies differ with regard to previous hypotheses of relationships within the Myriprisitinae, resolving a clade of cryptic reef associated and deep water non-reef dwelling lineages (Corniger+Plectrypops+Ostichthys) that is the sister lineage to a monophyletic Myripristis. Within Holocentrinae, Neoniphon and Sargocentron are strongly supported as paraphyletic, while Holocentrus is nested within Sargocentron. Using Bayesian ancestral state reconstruction methods, we demonstrate the taxonomically diagnostic characters for Neoniphon and Sargocentron likely represent character states with a complex evolutionary history that is not reflective of shared common ancestry. We propose a new classification for Holocentrinae, recognizing four lineages that are treated as genera: Sargocentron Fowler, 1904, Holocentrus Scopoli, 1777, Flameo Jordan and Evermann, 1898, and Neoniphon Castelnau, 1875. 12 page(s...|$|R
500|$|The tasselled {{wobbegong}} feeds on bony and cartilaginous fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. Its capacious mouth allows sizeable prey to be swallowed, with one documented {{case of a}} [...] long individual consuming a [...] long brownbanded bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum). During daytime, this species is an opportunistic ambush predator. It preys upon schooling nocturnal fishes such as squirrelfishes, <b>soldierfishes,</b> and sweepers that often shelter in the same cave. Tiny fishes and crustaceans have been seen settling atop the resting wobbegong's head, attracting larger fishes that are in turn attacked by the wobbegong. Observations in captivity have further revealed that this species seems to engage in active luring behavior. When it perceives food nearby, it begins to slowly wave its tail back and forth; its caudal fin resembles a small fish, complete with a dark eyespot at the base. The shark typically rests with its head elevated, which places it {{within striking distance of}} any prey drawn by its tail.|$|R
50|$|They {{are found}} in {{tropical}} parts of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, with the greatest species richness near reefs in the Indo-Pacific. Most are found at depths from the shoreline to 100 m, but some, notably {{the members of the}} genus Ostichthys, are generally found far deeper. Being largely or entirely nocturnal, they have relatively large eyes. During the day, they typically remain hidden in crevices, caves, or under ledges. Red and silvery colours dominate. The preopercle spines (near the gill opening) {{of the members of the}} subfamily Holocentrinae are venomous, and can give painful wounds. Most have a maximum length of 15 - 35 cm, but Sargocentron iota barely reaches 8 cm, and S. spiniferum and Holocentrus adscensionis can reach more than 50 cm. The squirrelfishes mainly feed on small fishes and benthic invertebrates, while the <b>soldierfishes</b> typically feed on zooplankton. The larvae are pelagic, unlike the adults, and can be found far out to sea.|$|R
