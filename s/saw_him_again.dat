5|$|After two {{unsuccessful}} seasons, Barcelona were {{in need of}} an overhaul, {{leading to}} the departure of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho. Upon the latter's departure, Messi was given the number 10 shirt. He signed a new contract in July 2008 on an annual salary of €7.8million, becoming the club's highest-paid player. Ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined {{for a total of}} eight months between 2006 and 2008. To combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the Argentina national team. As a result, Messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential. Despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again</b> voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.|$|E
5|$|Halperin {{cautioned that}} Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, {{and some of}} the {{statements}} about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.|$|E

5|$|Solanas {{said that}} she {{regularly}} suffered sexual abuse {{at the hands of}} her father. Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother remarried shortly afterwards. Solanas disliked her stepfather and began rebelling against her mother, becoming a truant. As a child, she wrote insults for children to use on one another, for the cost of a dime. She beat up a boy in high school who was bothering a younger girl, and also hit a nun. Because of her rebellious behavior, her mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents in 1949. Solanas said that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her. When she was 15, she left her grandparents and became homeless. In 1953, she gave birth to a son, fathered by a married sailor. The child, named David (later David Blackwell by adoption), was taken away from Solanas and she never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the end of}} the 1930s {{there was}} only church open in Kharkiv. The {{authorities}} refused to grant registration for priests to serve in it. Fr Gavriil was a priest in Kharkiv, and on Easter in what may have been 1936, he felt compelled to go to the church and serve the Resurrection Vigil. He disappeared after this and no one <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

25|$|In January 1836, Maria Isabella {{served as}} a godmother to her {{grandson}} Francisco, Duke of Calabria. In March that same year, the Prince of Capua contracted a morganatic marriage.

25|$|Eddy Merckx {{dominated}} world {{racing in}} both classics and stage races but couldn't win the Ronde. By 1969 {{he had not}} only frustration to contend with but rising resentment of other riders unhappy that he won so many races. He attacked early and half the field never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> The other half was reduced with each successive attack until he got clear alone. The chase was furious but ineffective and Merckx won by more than {{five and a half}} minutes over Felice Gimondi and more than eight minutes on the rest. The Ronde remained an unhappy race for him; it was another six years before he won again.|$|E
25|$|In mid-August, {{four months}} into his Florida sojourn, Ben {{returned}} to Tennessee for a week. His parents and girlfriend, Emily Greer, said he seemed optimistic. He {{told them he}} was working on getting certified as an instructor so he could find a job and that he was researching cave diving with an eye toward getting that certification as well. On his nights out with Greer, he told her of plans to eventually start a diving-related business. On the weekend of August 14–15, he returned to Florida, leaving behind a letter thanking his parents for the sabbatical and promising to look after them as they grew older. They never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E

25|$|During {{her care}} visits, Charlotte {{talks about her}} {{religious}} beliefs to Ambrose. She believes strongly in all the vengeful parts of the Old Testament, {{but also in the}} forgiveness that comes later. Ambrose, for his part, reveals that his father was thrown out by his mother when he was young, and he only <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again</b> after his mother died – a possible atonement for his years of estrangement. Arthur's behaviour never improves, and he insults Charlotte for being ugly. Finally, on the third evening, Charlotte promises Arthur something he won't forget, and enters his room wearing a skimpy outfit looking mischievous. But as she leaves, she looks uneasy about what she has just done.|$|E
500|$|According to Lori Haskell, {{the second}} man told the ticket agent: [...] "We need to get this man on the plane. He doesn't have a passport." [...] The ticket agent said nobody was allowed to board without a passport. The well-dressed man replied: [...] "We do this all the time; he's from Sudan." [...] Lori Haskell said {{the two men were}} {{directed}} down a corridor, to talk to a manager. [...] "We never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again</b> until he tried to blow up our plane," [...] Lori Haskell said of Abdulmutallab.|$|E
500|$|An [...] "ugly" [...] blonde-haired man {{was seen}} on 29 April on Rua do Ramelhete, {{and again on}} 2 May {{across the road from}} 5A, {{apparently}} watching it. On 30 April the granddaughter of 5A's former owners saw a blonde-haired man leaning against a wall behind the apartments, and <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again</b> on 2 May near the Tapas restaurant, looking at 5A. She described him as Caucasian, mid-30s, short cropped hair, [...] "ugly" [...] with spots. On the day of the disappearance or the day before, a man was seen staring at the McCanns' apartment block, where a white van was parked.|$|E

500|$|The San'a Institute {{obtained}} an {{exit visa}} {{for him at}} his request, and arranged for a car that {{took him to the}} airport on September 21, 2009 (the day his student visa expired), but the school's director said, [...] "After that, we never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again,</b> and apparently he did not leave Yemen". In October, Abdulmutallab told his father via text message saying {{that he did not want}} to attend business school in Dubai, and wanted instead to study Islamic law and Arabic in Yemen. When his father refused to pay for it, Abdulmutallab said he was [...] "already getting everything for free". He text-messaged his father, saying [...] "I've found a new religion, the real Islam", [...] "You should just forget about me, I'm never coming back", and [...] "Forgive me for any wrongdoing, I am no longer your child". The family was last in contact with their son in October 2009.|$|E
500|$|The most {{detailed}} account of Pitman's final fate in the war came from Robert G. Carter. In November 1862, Pitman was captured near Warrenton Junction on the march toward Fredericksburg, Virginia, during the weeks prior to the Battle of Fredericksburg. He had fallen behind the group because his feet had blistered and swollen due to the tightness of [...] "a pair of thin, high-heeled and narrow soled boots" [...] he had purchased. One of his comrades temporarily stayed behind to care for him but later decided {{to move on with}} the rest of the camp for fear of disciplinary consequences of falling out without authority. He was urged to move on, but without much success. Pitman's last words to his comrade were, [...] "I will be in camp by night, good by." [...] His fellow soldiers never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again</b> and considered him missing. Shortly after he was left, a band of Confederate guerrillas under Colonel John S. Mosby captured the weary and defenseless soldier without a struggle. The inscription on his tombstone differs slightly from Carter's account, stating he was captured by J. E. B. Stuart's cavalry instead.|$|E
500|$|Through this {{marriage}} Sneyd became step-mother to Edgeworth's four surviving children {{by his first}} wife, Anna Maria, ranging from seven months to nine years in age; Richard, Maria, who became a writer in her own right, Emmeline and Anna Maria. On encountering her new family she observed that Maria, then aged five, was exhibiting behavioural problems, and expressed her views that speedy and consistent punishment were the keys to ensuring good behaviour in children, a view she proceeded to practice. However she believed that such discipline needed to be imposed [...] "before the age of 5 or 6", and was therefore rather late {{in the case of}} the older children, however she imposed a strict discipline. Following a period of ill health on Sneyd's part, Maria Edgeworth was sent away to boarding school in Derby (1775–1781), and later London upon the death of Honora Sneyd (1781–1782). Similarly, her older brother Richard was sent to Charterhouse (1776–1778) and then went to sea, and she never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> Later Richard Edgeworth would comment on how difficult the first two years were for Sneyd in her new role as stepmother to undisciplined children, a role her relatives had advised her against.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly I saw the man, for whose reappearance I was so earnestly waiting, step casually out {{on to the}} pavement.

50|$|In the ETCC, Fitzpatrick {{returned}} to Ford Köln, to race their Ford Capri RS 2600. This switched back to Ford, <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> triumph <b>again</b> in the Austria-Trophäe, at the Salzburgring alongside raising Touring Car star, Dieter Glemser. After taking two more podium finishes, including a {{second place in}} the Spa 24 Hours, he would finish fifth in the overall standings.|$|R

Following this, Wildstylez released four solo tracks on Digital:Age, 'Huh?', 'Back to Basics', 'Lonely' and 'Into the Light'. In 2012 Wildstylez produced both the Dutch and Australian Defqon.1 anthems. The Dutch Anthem, 'World of Madness', <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> collaborate <b>again</b> with Headhunterz & Noisecontrollers.|$|R
500|$|Tulloch's {{approach}} has undoubtedly resulted in outcomes {{that would not}} have been possible otherwise. In 1991, he presented Edith Brown Haisman, a 96-year-old survivor of the disaster, with her father's pocket watch which had been retrieved from the sea bed. She had last seen it on 15 April 1912 when he waved goodbye to his wife and daughter as they left aboard lifeboat 14. They never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again</b> and he presumably went down with the ship. The watch was loaned to Haisman [...] "for life"; when she died four years later it was reclaimed by RMS Titanic Inc. On another occasion, a steamer trunk spotted in the debris field was found to contain three musical instruments, a deck of playing cards, a diary belonging to one Howard Irwin, and a bundle of letters from his girlfriend Pearl Shuttle. It was first thought that Irwin, a musician and professional gambler, had boarded the ship under a false identity. There was no record of him being among the passengers, even though a ticket had been purchased for him. It turned out that he had stayed ashore but his trunk had been brought aboard the ship by his friend Henry Sutehall, who was among the victims of the disaster. The fragile contents of the trunk were preserved due to the interior being starved of oxygen, which prevented bacteria from consuming the paper. Very few other shipwrecks have yielded readable paper.|$|E
500|$|After {{arriving}} in Paris, they soon relocated to Antibes on the French Riviera. While Scott was absorbed writing The Great Gatsby, Zelda became infatuated with a dashing young French pilot, Edouard S. Jozan. She spent afternoons swimming {{at the beach}} and evenings dancing at the casinos with Jozan. After six weeks, Zelda asked for a divorce. Scott at first demanded to confront Jozan, but instead dealt with Zelda's demand by locking her in their house, until she abandoned her request for divorce. Jozan did not know she'd asked for a divorce. He left the Riviera later that year, and the Fitzgeralds never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again.</b> Later in life he told Zelda's biographer Milford that any infidelity was imaginary: [...] "They both had a need of drama, they made it up and perhaps they were the victims of their own unsettled and a little unhealthy imagination." [...] In Fitzgerald's, [...] "A Life in Letters," [...] Fitzgerald referred to the Jozan affair in his August letter to Ludlow Fowler. He writes of lost illusions in The Great Gatsby as his lost certainty in Zelda's fidelity. The book reflected the dramatized pivotal aspects of his and Zelda's love, of courtship, break, restoration with financial success, and the Jozan betrayal: [...] "I feel old too, this summer... the whole burden of this novel—the loss of those illusions that give such color {{to the world that}} you don't care whether things are true or false as long as they partake of the magical glory." [...] The Great Gatsby was in draft form during the July 1924 Jozan crisis; the typescript was sent to Scribners at the end of October. Fitzgerald wrote in his notebooks, [...] "That September 1924, I knew something had happened that could never be repaired." ...|$|E
2500|$|Baret {{apparently}} {{changed her}} name to [...] "Jeanne de Bonnefoy" [...] during this period. Her child, born in December 1764, was given the name Jean-Pierre Baret. Baret gave the child up to the Paris Foundlings Hospital. He was quickly placed with a foster mother but died {{in the summer of}} 1765. (Commerson had left his legitimate son from his marriage in the care of his brother-in-law in Toulon-sur-Arroux and never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>again</b> in his lifetime.) ...|$|E
50|$|His {{new start}} with the Hull <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> sidelined <b>again</b> though, as he picked up an injury in only his second {{appearance}} for the team - in a match against his previous team, Wolves. He returned to the team in December after nearly four months out and featured {{in all but one}} of their remaining fixtures in what proved to be his only season for the club.|$|R
60|$|He {{could hear}} every respiration, {{tightened}} and almost sobbing, {{and he was}} hesitating whether to {{run the risk of}} addressing her; when, as if it had occurred to her suddenly that she was alone and deserted, she raised up her head with a startled movement, but, as she <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> she <b>again</b> hid her face, as if his presence were still more intolerable than solitude.|$|R
5000|$|Jesus' {{followers}} {{began to}} proclaim {{him as the}} Son of God after he was executed and they <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> alive <b>again.</b> (Historians {{do not know what}} experiences his followers actually had.) They also began to call him the Anointed ("Messiah" [...] in Hebrew and [...] "Christ" [...] in Greek) and Lord. Early Christians developed various view of how Jesus related to God and what role he played in God's plan for salvation.|$|R
