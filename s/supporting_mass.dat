25|$|The Miami area {{is known}} for its high level of {{automobile}} dependency and lack of public transportation, which has led to an increasing traffic problem throughout the county. Nearly 20% of household income is spent on transportation and Miami had the most decentralized office space of any metropolitan area in the United States, according to a study in 2000. Despite overwhelming support for public transportation to be funded in place of several new highways in the 1970s, Miami's Metrorail system was not functional until 1984 and as of 2014 has failed to reach the scope which was promised over 30 years ago. Ridership was very low in the early years, averaging less than 10,000 riders per day. The system was not finished, even after nearly US$1 billion in federal subsidies, meaning that approximately US$100,000 was spent for each passenger. This led to criticism from then President Ronald Reagan, who stated {{that it would have been}} a lot cheaper to buy everyone a limousine. Those <b>supporting</b> <b>mass</b> transit argued that the low ridership was due to the system being incomplete and not going where people needed it to, and noted that within a few years ridership was nearing 50,000 per day. Many of Miami and Florida's politicians have not been advocates of alternative transportation. For example, both state governors Jeb Bush and Rick Scott denied funding for an intercity high-speed rail system in Florida. Two state senators tried to force Scott to accept the funding, but the Florida Supreme Court denied the case and the funding was later directed to several other rail projects across the United States.|$|E

40|$|The magneto-rheological visco-elastomer (MRVE) {{is used as}} a smart core {{to control}} the {{stochastic}} micro-vibration of a sandwich plate with <b>supported</b> <b>mass.</b> The micro-vibration response of the sandwich plate with MRVE core and <b>supported</b> <b>mass</b> under stochastic <b>support</b> motion excitations is studied and compared to evaluate the vibration suppression capability. The effects of the <b>supported</b> <b>mass</b> and localized magnetic field on the stochastic micro-vibration response of the MRVE sandwich plate are taken into account. The dynamic characteristics of the MRVE core in micro-vibration are described by a non-homogeneous complex modulus dependent on vibration frequency and controllable by applied magnetic fields. The partial differential equations for the coupled transverse and longitudinal motions of the MRVE sandwich plate with <b>supported</b> <b>mass</b> are derived from the dynamic equilibrium, constitutive and geometric relations. The simplified ordinary differential equations are obtained for the transverse vibration of the MRVE sandwich plate under localized magnetic fields. A frequency-domain solution method for the stochastic micro-vibration response of sandwich plates with <b>supported</b> <b>mass</b> is developed based on the Galerkin method and random vibration theory. The expressions of frequency-response functions, response power spectral densities and root-mean-square velocity responses of the plate in terms of the one-third octave frequency band are obtained for micro-vibration evaluation. Finally, numerical results are given to illustrate the large response reduction capacity of the MRVE sandwich plate with <b>supported</b> <b>mass</b> under stochastic <b>support</b> motion excitations, and the influences of MRVE parameters, <b>supported</b> <b>mass</b> and localized magnetic field placement on the micro-vibration response.

5000|$|In May 1935, {{the same}} month as the movie's release, Lü Ji and other leftists in Shanghai had begun an amateur choir and started {{promoting}} a National Salvation singing campaign, <b>supporting</b> <b>mass</b> singing associations along the lines established the year before by Liu Liangmo, a Shanghai YMCA leader. Although the movie did not perform well enough to keep Diantong from closing, its theme song became wildly popular: musicologist Feng Zikai reported hearing it being sung by crowds in rural villages from Zhejiang to Hunan within months of its release and, at a performance at a Shanghai sports stadium in June 1936, Liu's chorus of hundreds was joined by its audience of thousands. Although Tian Han was imprisoned for two years, Nie Er fled toward Russia only to die en route in Japan, and Liu Liangmo eventually fled to the U.S. to escape harassment from the Nationalists. The singing campaign continued to expand, particularly after the December 1936 Xi'an Incident reduced Nationalist pressure against leftist movements.

50|$|While many secular {{buildings}} exist {{from the}} Late Middle Ages, {{it is in}} the cathedrals and great churches that Gothic architecture displays its pertinent structures and characteristics to the fullest advantage. 19th century art historians and critics, used to the Baroque or Neoclassical works of the 17th and 18th centuries, were astounded by the soaring heights of a Gothic cathedral and made note of the extreme length compared to proportionally modest width and accentuating clusters of support colonnettes. This emphasis on verticality and light was applied to an ecclesiastical building was achieved by the development of certain architectural features of the Gothic style that, when together, provided inventive solutions to various engineering problems. As Eugène Viollet-le-Duc observed, the Gothic cathedral, almost always laid out in a cruciform shape, was based on a logical skeleton of clustered columns, pointed ribbed vaults and flying buttresses arranged in a system of diagonal arches and arches enclosing the vault field that allows the outward thrust exerted by the groin vaults to be channeled from the walls and into specific points on a <b>supporting</b> <b>mass.</b> The result of this curvature in the vaults and arches of the church was the casting of indeterminable localised thrust that architects learned to counter with an opposing thrust {{in the form of the}} flying buttress and application of calculated weight via the pinnacle. This dynamic system of various constituent elements filling a certain role allowed for the slimming of previously massive walls or replacement thereof with windows. Gothic churches were also very ornamented and highly decorated, serving as a Poor Man's Bible and a record of their construction in the stained glass windows that admit light into the church interior and some of the gargoyles. These structures, for centuries the principle landmark in a town, would then often be surmounted by one or more towers and pinnacles and perhaps tall spires.|$|E

40|$|Ambient Intelligence is {{a vision}} {{on the future}} of {{consumer}} electronics, telecommunications and computing in which devices move into the background {{while at the same time}} placing the user experience in the foreground. Producing Ambient Intelligent environments on a large scale is problematic however. First, it is technologically not possible in the foreseeable future to mass produce a product or service that generates Ambient Intelligence, given the current state-of-the-art in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Second, it is economically not feasible to manually design and produce Ambient Intelligence applications for each person individually. One of the main research questions in creating such environments is the design of a system capable of <b>supporting</b> <b>mass</b> customization of ambient experiences by means of end-user programming.

40|$|While protein {{tyrosine}} (Tyr) kinases (PTKs) {{have been}} extensively characterized in eukaryotes, far less {{is known about}} their emerging counterparts in prokaryotes. The inner-membrane Wzc/Etk protein belongs to the bacterial PTK family, which has an important function in regulating the polymerization and transport of virulence-determining capsular polysaccharide (CPS). The kinase uses a unique two-step activation process involving intra-phosphorylation of a Tyr residue, although the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Herein, we report the first crystal structure of a bacterial PTK, the C-terminal kinase domain of Escherichia coli Tyr kinase (Etk) at 2. 5 -Å resolution. The fold of the Etk kinase domain differs markedly from that of eukaryotic PTKs. Based on the observed structure and <b>supporting</b> <b>mass</b> spectrometric evidence of Etk, a unique activation mechanism is proposed that involves the phosphorylated Tyr residue, Y 574, at the active site and its specific interaction with a previously unidentified key Arg residue, R 614, to unblock the active site. Both in vitro kinase activity and in vivo antibiotics resistance studies using structure-guided mutants further support the novel activation mechanism...|$|E

40|$|Management {{research}} has been long emphasizing the fundamental contribution of individual competencies {{to the development of}} company competences, which thus affect organizational success or failure. To date, the debate over critical individual competences has almost ignored in research on Mass Customization. As a consequence, we know a lot about the possible methods and organizational arrangements <b>supporting</b> <b>Mass</b> Customization, but we know very little as how the human variable enters the puzzle. Given this fact, the present paper explores what roles are mostly affected by mass customization within the company, as well as what fundamental requirements Mass Customization poses to the manufacturing firm in terms of individual competences. We address these questions by means of a qualitative interview-based study involving 46 experts across 5 European countries. Our findings indicate that (1) R&D operative roles {{play a central role in}} the achievement of a Mass Customization capability and suffer from a serious gap or customization-related competencies; (2) individual attitudes, almost neglected in extant research on Mass Customization, are essential in determining the individual’s capability to perform customization-related tasks and finally (3) that methods knowledge is perceived by respondents as not so critical as individual attitudes and context knowledge...|$|E
