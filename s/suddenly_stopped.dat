One {{particular}} night, Dickinson <b>suddenly</b> <b>stopped</b> {{in the middle of a}} song and started interviewing a man in the audience, heckling for not paying enough attention. He got such a good response he started doing it every night until it became a regular routine used to catch the audience's attention. Dickinson states that this experience taught him how to be a frontman.|$|E

5|$|The owner at {{the time}} of the building's {{nomination}} to the National Register of Historic Places, Phil Becker, grew up living on Mazon Street (Illinois Route 17). He had been hanging out at the station since he was nine and began working at the station in 1964. One year after Becker's employment began, Ambler sold the station to Earl Kochler. Kochler sold the station to Royce McBeath, who ran it between 19651970. The station changed hands once again when Becker bought the station from McBeath on March 4, 1970. About a year after Becker took over operation of the station, Texaco <b>suddenly</b> <b>stopped</b> supplying the location with gasoline and Becker contracted with Marathon Oil. The brand change was accompanied by a name change to Becker's Marathon Gas Station, a name the station would be known by for over 26years. Becker operated the station, along with his wife Debbie, from the time of purchase until 1996. After closing the station, the couple leased the building out as an auto repair shop and eventually donated the building to the village of Dwight.|$|E

25|$|On May 27, 1995, Reeve's horse made a refusal. Witnesses {{said that}} the horse began the third fence jump and <b>suddenly</b> <b>stopped.</b> Reeve fell forward off the horse, {{holding on to the}} reins. His hands somehow became tangled in the reins, and the bridle and bit were pulled off the horse. He landed head first {{on the far side of}} the fence, {{shattering}} his first and second vertebrae. This cervical spinal injury, which paralyzed him from the neck down, also halted his breathing. Paramedics arrived three minutes later and immediately took measures to get air into his lungs. He was taken first to the local hospital, before being flown by helicopter to the University of Virginia Medical Center. Afterwards, he had no recollection of the accident. Due to this injury, Armand Assante replaced Reeve for the role of Alan Breck Stewart in Kidnapped.|$|E

25|$|The class {{studied a}} number of Bahá'í works between 1934 and 1938 - Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era, a {{compilation}} of letters from Shoghi Effendi, Some Answered Questions and other collections of `Abdu'l-Bahá's writings and talks {{as well as the}} The Dawn-Breakers. In late 1936 Dr. Zia Bagdadi and his family moved to Augusta, the first Persian Bahá'ís to live in the area and the community counted some 30 members plus friends and about as many interested contacts. And with a couple African-Americans the community was also partially integrated despite frequent presentations in African-American establishments over the years, though it is also true larger integration could have drawn unwelcome attention. On the other hand there were no champions of integration insisting on that standard. Dr Bagdadi succeeded in making contacts among African-Americans, notably a doctor, as well as progressively larger and larger meetings at a home but these <b>suddenly</b> <b>stopped</b> with rumors the police and spoken to the family. However Bagdadi suddenly died April 1937.|$|E
25|$|On 20 June, British heavy {{artillery}} bombarded German communications {{behind the front}} line {{as far back as}} Bapaume and then continued intermittently until the evening of 22 June. At dawn on 24 June, a shrapnel barrage began on the German front position and villages nearby. At noon more accurate fire began and in the evening a light rain turned the German positions into mud. On 25 June, {{heavy artillery}}-fire predominated, smashing trenches and blocking dug-outs, setting fire to supply dumps and causing large explosions in Montauban. Variations in the intensity of fire indicated likely areas to be attacked, the greatest weight of fire occurring at Mametz, Fricourt and Ovillers; during the night the German commanders prepared their defences around the villages and ordered the second line to be manned. After an overnight lull, the bombardment increased again on 26 June, then <b>suddenly</b> <b>stopped.</b> The German garrisons took post and fired red rockets to call for artillery support and a German barrage was fired into no man's land. Later in the afternoon, huge mortar bombs began to fall, destroying shallower dug-outs and a super-heavy gun bombarded the main German strong-points, as smaller guns pulverised the villages close to the front line, from which civilians were hurriedly removed.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contained}} {{a number of}} references to pop culture. Elaine mentions that a man she knows used to nod at her whenever she saw him, but <b>suddenly</b> <b>stopped,</b> leading her to state, [...] " [...] he went from nods to nothing." [...] This prompts George to hum the Tony Bennett song [...] "Rags to Riches", replacing the chorus with [...] "nods to nothing". During a discussion with Elaine, Jerry mentions the 1958 film The Blob. Jerry also mentions the novel Moby Dick, jokingly stating that [...] "when you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends".

500|$|Throughout January 1944, AirSols {{aircraft}} {{based in}} the Solomon Islands and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft based on Kiriwina kept up a sustained air offensive against Rabaul. Under steady and relentless pressure, the Japanese air defence began to weaken, allowing a landing {{to be made on}} 15 February by New Zealand troops on the Green Islands, which lie little more than [...] from Rabaul. On 16 and 17 February, the US Pacific Fleet's Task Force 58 attacked the main Japanese base at Truk. Most Japanese aircraft were recalled to defend Truk and 19 February saw the last significant interception of Allied aircraft over Rabaul. Meanwhile, on 13 February, General MacArthur had issued orders for the invasion of the Admiralty Islands, codenamed Operation Brewer, which was now scheduled for 1 April. Forces assigned included the 1st Cavalry Division; No.73 Wing RAAF, providing close air support; the 592nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR); the US Marines' 1st Amphibious Tractor Battalion; and US Naval Construction Battalions ("Seabees") to build the naval base—a total of 45,000personnel. However, on 23 February 1944 three Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell bombers flew low over Los Negros. The airmen reported that there were no signs of enemy activity and the islands had been evacuated. Lieutenant General George Kenney, the commander of Allied Air Forces in the South West Pacific Area, went to MacArthur and proposed that the unoccupied islands be quickly taken by a small force. According to Kenney: [...] "The General listened for a while, paced back and forth as I kept talking, nodded occasionally, then <b>suddenly</b> <b>stopped</b> and said: That will put the cork in the bottle." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was then}} about three o'clock.
