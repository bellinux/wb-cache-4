40|$|The {{complexity}} of the travelling experience cannot be understood {{outside the scope of}} culture (see, for instance, Schulz-Forberg 2005) and travelling is thus often discussed in relation to the human being‟s thirst for knowledge, intellectual or spiritual enlightenment, aesthetic refinement, often as a result of cultural contact, interaction, transfer or exchange. The travelling experiences of Romanian travellers to England through the centuries have been inspired by many of these goals. This paper focuses on the travel accounts of a little known Romanian traveller to England in the nineteenth century, namely, writer, teacher, journalist and politician Ion Codru-Drăgușanu (1818 – 1884). His travel accounts reveal that travelling was perceived as a source of intellectual improvement, maturation, cultural development, interaction and exchange, as a process of gaining knowledge, an experience also counterbalanced by a tourist‟s adventure dominated by curiosity, pleasure and amusement. In order to reveal how this shift takes place and the multi-fold significance of the travelling experience as such, the paper‟s structure combines theoretical data with textual study and seeks to rediscover forgotten personalities of the Romanian culture who made English-Romanian encounters more numerous and productive. Firstly, the paper presents the conceptual distinctions between the term traveller and other related words, such as voyager, tourist, pilgrim, explorer, or migrant. Secondly, it makes a brief overview of travelling in history and of travel writing with the purpose of contextualizing Codru-Drăgușanu‟s travels. Thirdly, the <b>synoptic</b> <b>presentation</b> of the literary background related to travels to and from Romania in the nineteenth century as well as the brief review of the historical and cultural context specific to England in that period assist us in our exploration of the written accounts of travels recorded by CodruDrăgușanu in his Peregrinul transilvan. 1835 – 1848 (The Transylvanian Traveller. 1835 – 1848) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONProjections of Musical Jewishness: Composers of Hollywood’s Golden AgebyAaron FruchtmanDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in MusicUniversity of California, Riverside, June 2016 Dr. Byron Adams, Chairperson	This {{dissertation}} investigates landmark Jewish topic film {{scores by}} composers writing dramatic {{music in the}} Golden Age of Hollywood (1932 - 1960). This study is a <b>synoptic</b> <b>presentation,</b> or as Wittgenstein might say, a “perspicuous representation” of the musical Jewish world of Hollywood. During this period, Jewish composers, who had generally been viewed as marginal figures in music history, found a rare moment of insider status and wrote music informed by their Jewish heritage. Drawing from extensive archival research, I examine the life and music of Max Steiner, {{one of the most}} successful composers in Hollywood history, with special emphasis placed on his seminal score to the “ghetto film” Symphony of Six Million (1932). A separate chapter explores Alfred Newman’s scores to a collection of Jewish topic films including The House of Rothschild (1934), Gentleman’s Agreement (1947), and The Diary of Anne Frank (1959). This is then compared and contrasted with Newman’s musical portrayals of the numinous in his scores to several post-war biblical epics, particularly focusing on The Robe (1953) and David and Bathsheba (1951). The final chapter focuses on the issue of cross reference in three seemingly disparate films on Jewish subjects by Franz Waxman, Alfred Newman, and Ernest Gold. The themes from Mr. Skeffington (1944), David and Bathsheba (1944), and Exodus (1960) share striking similarities, prompting an investigation of the musical sources that influenced these composers. The search aims to better understand Jewish musical signifiers in Hollywood. The film scores presented in this dissertation are texts that can offer understandings about the composers who created them and their shared social world in Hollywood. With this study there is a new point of departure for discussions about the complicated connection between musical Jewishness and Hollywood...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{features of}} the genetic text edition of this volume consisting of 70 poems are – in hierachical order – accuracy, legibility and austerity {{of the means of}} representation. The task was the complete and exact portrayal of all the classifiable manuscripts from the estate, which were available – but not universally edited for the archives – {{at the time of the}} completion of the project by the Germanistisches Institut of the RTWH Aachen. There were some additional finds from private sources so that about 800 manuscript pages had to be considered – some of them hardly legible and not easily to be incorporated in the genesis of the texts. The edition relies on the paradigmatic presentation by column, first developped by Hans Zeller for the edition of C. F. Meyer. Its model is the Bonn Celan edition (BCA), these days the tried and trusted prototype for editions of unrhymed, short poems not organized in metrical form. The essential modifications of this concept are due to the idiosyncrasies of both the manuscripts and Ernst Meister's way of working. It was therefore necessary to introduce an additional category for the apparatus to list the frequent "additional texts" of Ernst Meister, which do not belong to the texts themselves but relate to them in varying degrees. In addition, a way had to be found to differentiate between the chronological text versions. Three means of presentation are being employed: 1) the integral complete reproduction of a text version, 2) the synoptic representation of several versions and 3) the abbreviated listing of any divergence from the previous text version. 1) and 2) and 2) and 3) can be combined.

40|$|The {{studies which}} form the {{background}} for this <b>synoptic</b> <b>presentation</b> aimed {{to contribute to}} the investigation of the reason for great yearly fluctuations in recruitment in marine fish stocks. In order to evaluate if mass mortality due to starvation in the larval stage contributes to these fluctuations, trypsin activity was suggested as an appropriate indicator to assess individually both the nutritional condition and feeding activity of fish larvae of all age stages. Based on the principle of conventional chromogenic methods a highly sensitive fluorometric measurement was developed, which allows the individual assessment of tryptic activity even in the youngest larval stages. In order to evaluate species-specific features of tryptic activity, larvae of six different marine species were reared under laboratory conditions (herring, Clupea harengus, turbot, Scophthalmus maximus, cod, Gadus morhua, sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata, and Brazilian sardine, Sardinella brasiliensis). The exemplary application of the laboratory calibration in field surveys clearly demonstrates that the tryptic activity is appropriate to evaluate the nutritional condition of larvae from field samples. Examples for some species are presented (herring, cod and sprat). The most significant results from laboratory experiments: Larval age and larval size were chosen as the standard for comparison to relate to tryptic activity. Tryptic activity was found even in yolk sac stages of the investigated species. Tryptic activity increases with age in continuously fed larvae following a non-linear pattern which is supposed to be determined in the ontogenetic development of each species. Increase in tryptic activity persists until larvae develop a functional stomach. The amount of maximum tryptic activity at a given size and age is species specific: turbot larvae show the highest whereas herring larvae have the lowest values at a given age. The amount of trypsin which has its origin in the ingested food oganism is of minor significance for the measurement. Tryptic acticity reacts very sensitive on variations in food density. Not only fed and starved larvae can be separated but also larvae kept at high and low food concentration. Differences in tryptic activity between fed and starved larvae are statistically significant in the majority of the investigated species, but differences in larvae kept at high and low food densities are not always significant. In yolk sac stages and beyond, while adapting to exogenic food sources, differences in tryptic activity are insignificant in larvae with and without food supply. This stage can last until ten days after hatching, depending from the species. When relying completely on external food sources, differences in tryptic activity occurs within hours when fed and starving larvae are compared. However, significant differences arise only after 1 - 3 days, depending on species, size and age. Species with their origin in temperate latitudes shows a slower decrease in tryptic activity compared to species from subtropical or tropical areas. If food deprivation persists, tryptic activity levels off to zero within days; the number of days is depending from the species, age and size. Individual variability of tryptic activity is large in continuously fed larvae, moderate in larvae kept on low food density and disappears in starving larvae. A diurnal rhythm in tryptic activity was identified. In addition, tryptic activity increases as a consequence of active feeding and decreases thereafter within hours to the pre-feeding level; however, those level is always well above the tryptic activity level of starving larvae. Starving larvae show a very weak diurnal oscillation in tryptic activity. 196 Laboratory calibration was used to estimate the number of starving larvae in field samples. For this purpose, tryptic activity was related to the larval size and the values for starving larvae were fitted to a linear regression. The upper 99...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{experimental and}} related theoretical studies of pyrochlore titanate oxides, boron nitride nanotubes, and multiferroic bismuth ferrite. We have investigated these systems at high pressures and at low temperatures using Raman spectroscopy. Below, we furnish a <b>synoptic</b> <b>presentation</b> {{of our work}} on these three systems. In Chapter 1, we introduce the systems studied in this thesis, viz. pyrochlores, boron nitride nanotubes, and multiferroic BiFeO 3, with {{a review of the}} literature pertaining to their structural, electronic, vibrational, and mechanical properties. We also bring out our interests in these systems. Chapter 2 includes a brief description of the theory of Raman scattering and infrared absorption. This is followed by a short account of the experimental setups used for Raman and infrared measurements. We also present the technical details of high pressure technique including the alignment of diamond anvil cells, gasket preparation, calibration of the pressure, etc. Chapter 3 furnishes the results of our pressure-and temperature-dependent studies of pyrochlore oxides which has been divided into eight different parts. In recent years, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of pyrochlores have received a lot of attention. However, not much work has been reported to address the quasiparticle excitations, e. g., phonons and crystal-field excitations in these materials. A material that shows exotic magnetic behavior and high degree of degenerate ground states can be expected to have low-lying excitations with possible couplings with phonons, thereby, finger-printing various novel properties of the system. Raman and infrared absorption spectroscopies can, therefore, be used to comprehend the novel role of phonons and their role in various phenomena of frustrated magnetic pyrochlores. Recently, there have been reports on various novel properties of these systems; for example, Raman and absorption studies [Phys. Rev. B 77, 214310 (2008) ] have revealed a loss of inversion symmetry in Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7 at low temperatures which has been suggested as the key reason for this frustrated magnet to remain in spin-liquid state down to 70 mK. Powder neutron-diffraction experiments [Nature 420, 54 (2002) ] have shown that an application of isostatic pressure of about 8. 6 GPa in spin-liquid Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7 induces a long-range magnetic order of the Tb 3 + spins coexisting with the spin-liquid phase ascribing this transition to the breakdown of the delicate balance among the various fundamental interactions. Moreover, Raman and x-ray studies have shown that Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7,Sm 2 Ti 2 O 7,and Gd 2 Ti 2 O 7 undergo a structural transition followed by an irreversible amorphization at very high pressures (~ 40 GPa or above) [Appl. Phys. Lett. 88, 031903 (2006) ]. In this chapter, therefore, we present our temperature-and pressure-dependent Raman studies of A 2 Ti 2 O 7 pyrochlores, where ‘A’ is a trivalent rare-earth element (A = Sm, Gd,Tb, Dy,Ho, Er,Yb, and Lu; and also Y). Since all the group theoretically predicted Raman modes of this cubic lattice are due to oxygen vibrations only, in Part (A), we revisit the phonon assignments of pyrochlore titanates by performing Raman measurements on the O 16 /O 18 − isotope based Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 and Lu 2 Ti 2 O 7 and find that the vibrations with frequencies below 250 cm− 1 do not involve oxygen atoms. Our results lead to a reassignment of the pyrochlore Raman phonons thus proposing that the mode with frequency ~ 200 cm− 1, which has earlier been known as an F 2 g phonon due to oxygen vibration, is a vibration of Ti 4 + ions. Moreover, we have performed lattice dynamical calculations using Shell model that help us to assign the Raman phonons. In Part (B), we have explored the temperature dependence of the Raman phonons of spin-ice Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 and compared with the results of two non-magnetic pyrochlores, Lu 2 Ti 2 O 7 and Y 2 Ti 2 O 7. Our results reveal anomalous red-shift of some of the phonons in both magnetic and non-magnetic pyrochlores as the temperature is lowered. The phonon anomalies can not be understood in terms of spin-phonon and crystal field transition-phonon couplings, thus attributing them to phonon-phonon anharmonic interactions. We also find that the anomaly of the disorder activated Ti 4 + Raman vibration (~ 200 cm− 1) is unusually high compared to other phonons due to the large vibrational amplitudes of Ti 4 +-ions rendered by the vacant Wyckoff sites in their neighborhood. Later, we have quantified the anharmonicity in Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7. We have extended our studies on spin-ice compound Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 by performing simultaneous pressure-and temperature-dependent Raman measurements, presented in Part (C). We show that a new Raman mode appears at low temperatures below TC ~ 110 K, suggesting a structural transition, also supported by our x-ray measurements. There are reports [Phys. Rev. B 77, 214310 (2008), Phys. Rev. B 79, 214437 (2009) ] in the literature where the new mode in Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 at low temperatures has been assigned to a crystal field transition. Here, we put forward evidences that suggest that the “new” mode is a phonon and not a crystal field transition. Moreover, the TC is found to depend on pressure with a positive coefficient. In Part (D), we have presented our results of temperature-and pressure-dependent Raman and x-ray measurements of spin-frustrated pyrochlores Gd 2 Ti 2 O 7, Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7,and Yb 2 Ti 2 O 7. Here, we have estimated the quasiharmonic and anharmonic contributions to the anomalous change in phonon frequencies with temperature. Moreover, we find that Gd 2 Ti 2 O 7 and Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7 undergo a subtle structural transition at a pressure of ~ 9 GPa which is absent in Yb 2 Ti 2 O 7. The implication of this structural transition in the context of a long-range magnetically ordered state coexisting with the spin-liquid phase in Tb 2 Ti 2 O 7 at high pressure (8. 6 GPa) and low temperature (1. 5 K), observed by Mirebeau et al. [Nature 420, 54 (2002) ], has been discussed. As we have established in the previous parts that the anomalous behavior of pyrochlore phonons is due to phonon-phonon anharmonic interactions, we have tuned the anharmonicity in the first pyrochlore of the A 2 Ti 2 O 7 series, i. e., Sm 2 Ti 2 O 7,by replacing Ti 4 +-ions with bigger Zr 4 +-ions, presented in Part (E). Our results suggest that the phonon anomalies have a very strong dependence on the ionic size and mass of the transition element (i. e., the B 4 +-ion in A 2 B 2 O 7 pyrochlores). We have also observed signatures of coupling between a phonon and crystal-field transitions in Sm 2 Ti 2 O 7. In Part (F), we have studied spin-ice compound Ho 2 Ti 2 O 7 and compared the phonon anomalies with the stuffed spin-ice compounds, Ho 2 +xTi 2 −xO 7 −x/ 2 by stuffing Ho 3 + ions into the sites of Ti 4 + with appropriate oxygen stoichiometry. We find that as more and more Ho 3 +-ions are stuffed, there is an increase in the structural disorder of the pyrochlore lattice and the phonon anomalies gradually disappear with increasing Ho 3 +-ions. Moreover, a coupling between phonon and crystal field transition has also been observed. In Part (G), we have examined the temperature dependence of phonons of “dynamical spin-ice” compound Pr 2 Sn 2 O 7 and compared with its non-pyrochlore (monoclinic) counterpart Pr 2 Ti 2 O 7. Our results conclude that the anomalous behavior of phonons is an intrinsic property of pyrochlore structure having inherent vacant sites. We also find a coupling between phonon and crystal-field transitions in Pr 2 Sn 2 O 7. In the last part of this chapter, Part (H), we present our Raman studies of Er 2 Ti 2 O 7. Here, we show that in addition to the anomalous phonons, there are modes that originate from photoluminescence transitions and some of these luminescence lines show anomalous temperature dependence which have been understood using the theory of optical dephasing in crystals, developed by Hsu and Skinner [J. Chem. Phys. 81, 1604 (1984) ]. Temperature dependence of a few Raman modes and photoluminescence bands suggest a phase transition at 130 K. In Chapter 4, we furnish our pressure-dependent Raman studies of boron nitride multi-walled nanotubes (BNNT) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and compare the results with those of their carbon counterparts. Using Raman spectroscopy, we show that BNNT undergo an irreversible transition at ~ 12 GPa while the carbon counterpart, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, show a similar transition at a much higher pressure of ~ 51 GPa. In sharp contrast, the layered form of both the systems (i. e. h-BN and graphite) undergo a hexagonal to wurtzite phase at nearly similar pressure (~ 13 GPa of h-BN and ~ 15 GPa for graphite). A molecular dynamical simulation on boron nitride single-walled nanotubes has also been undertaken that suggests that the polar nature of the B−N bonds may be responsible for the irreversibility of the pressure-induced transformations. It is interesting to see that in hexagonal phase both the systems have almost similar mechanical property, but once they are rolled up to make nanotubes, the property becomes quite different. Chapter 5 presents the temperature dependence of the Raman modes of multiferroic thin films of BiFeO 3 and Bi 0. 7 Tb 0. 2 La 0. 1 O 3. Though there have been several Raman investigations of BiFeO 3 in literature, here we emphasize the observation of unusually intense second order Raman phonons. Our results have motivated Waghmare et al. to suggest a theoretical model to explain the anomalously large second order Raman tensor of BiFeO 3 in terms of an incipient metal-insulator transition. In Chapter 6, we summarize our findings on the three different systems, namely, pyrochlores, boron nitride nanotubes, and BiFeO 3 and highlight a few possible experiments that may be undertaken in future to have a better understanding of these systems...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{experimental studies}} of device characteristics and vibrational properties of atomic layer thin graphene and molybdenum disulphide (MoS 2). We carried out Raman spectroscopic studies on field effect transistors (FET) fabricated from these materials to investigate the phonons renormalized by carrier doping thus giving quantitative information on electron-phonon coupling. Below, we furnish a <b>synoptic</b> <b>presentation</b> of our work on these systems. Chapter 1 : Introduction Chapter 1, presents a detailed introduction of the systems studied in this the¬sis, namely single layer graphene (SLG), bilayer graphene (BLG) and single layer molybdenum disulphide (MoS 2). We have mainly discussed their electronic and vibrational properties {{in the light of}} Raman spectroscopy. A review of the Raman studies on graphene layers is presented. Chapter 2 : Methodology and Experimental Techniques Chapter 2 starts with a description of Raman instrumentation. The steps for isolating graphene and MoS 2 flakes and the subsequent device fabrication procedures involving lithography are discussed in detail. A brief account of the top gated ﬁeld effect transistor (FET) using solid polymer electrolyte is presented. Chapter 3 : Band gap opening in bilayer graphene and formation of p-n junction in top gated graphene transistors: Transport and Raman studies In Chapter 3 the bilayer graphene (BLG) ﬁeld effect transistor is fabricated in a dual gate configuration which enables us to control the energy band gap and the Fermi level independently. The gap in bilayer energy spectrum is observed through different values of the resistance maximum in the back gate sweep curves, each taken at a fixed top gate voltage. The gate capacitance of the polymer electrolyte is estimated from the experimental data to be 1. 5 μF/cm 2. The energy gap opened between the valence and conduction bands using this dual-gated geometry is es¬timated invoking a simple model which takes into account the screening of gate induced charges between the two layers. The presence of the controlled gap in the energy band structure along with the p-n junction creates a new possibility for the bilayer to be used as possible source of terahertz source. The formation of p-n junction along a bilayer graphene (BLG) channel is achieved in a electrolytically top gated BLG FET, where the drain-source voltage VDS across the channel is continuously varied at a fixed top gate voltage VT(VT> 0). Three cases may arise as VDS is varied keeping VT fixed: (i) for VT-VDS 0, the entire channel is doped with electron, (ii) for VT-VDS= 0, the drain end becomes depleted of carriers and kink in the IDS vs VDS curve appears, (iii) for VT-VDS « 0, carrier reversal takes place at the drain end, accumulation of holes starts taking place at the drain end while the source side is still doped with electrton. The verification of the spatial variation of carrier concentration in a similar top gated single layer graphene (SLG) FET device is done using spatially resolved Ra¬man spectroscopy. The signature 2 D Raman band in a single layer graphene shows opposite trend when doped: 2 D peak position decreases for electron doping while it increases for hole doping. On the other hand, the G mode response being symmetric in doping can act as a read-out for the carrier concentration. We monitor the peak position of the G and the 2 D bands at different locations along the SLG FET channel. For a fixed top gate voltage V T, both G and the 2 D band frequencies vary along the channel. For a positive VTsuch that VT-VDS= 0, the peak frequencies ωGand ω 2 DωG/ 2 D occur at the undoped frequency (ωG/ 2 D) n= 0 near the drain end while the source end corresponds to non-zero concentration. When VT-VDS< 0, Raman spectra from hole doped regions (drain end) in the channels show an blue-shift in ω 2 Dwhile from the electron doped regions (near source) ω 2 Dis softened. Chapter 4 : Mixing Of Mode Symmetries In Top Gated Bilayer And Multilayer Graphene Field Effect Devices In Chapter 4, the effect of gating on a bilayer graphene is captured by using Raman spectroscopy which shows a mixing of different optical modes belonging to differ¬ent symmetries. The zone-center G phonon mode splits into a low frequency (Glow) and a high frequency (Ghigh) mode and the two modes show different dependence on doping. The two G bands show different trends with doping, implying different electron-phonon coupling. The frequency separation between the two sub-bands in¬creases with increased doping. The mode with higher frequency, termed as Ghigh, shows stiffening as we increase the doping whereas the other mode, Glow, shows softening for low electron doping and then hardening at higher doping. The mode splitting is explained in terms of mixing of zone-center in-plane optical phonons rep¬resenting in-phase and out-of-phase inter-layer atomic motions. The experimental results are combined with the theoretical predictions made using density functional theory by Gava et al. [PRB 80, 155422 (2009) ]. Similar G band splitting is observed in the Raman spectra from multilayer graphene showing inﬂuence of stacking on the symmetry properties. Chapter 5 : Anomalous dispersion of D and 2 D modes in graphene and doping dependence of 2 D ′and 2 D+G bands Chapter 5 consists of two parts: Part A titled “Doping dependent anomalous dispersion of D and 2 D modes in graphene” describes the tunability of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) associated with the highest optical phonon branch (K-A) around the zone corner K using a top gated single layer graphene ﬁeld effect transistor. Raman D and 2 D modes originate from this branch and are dispersive with laser excitation energy. Since the EPC is proportional to the slope of the phonon branch, doping dependence of the D and 2 D modes is carried out for different laser energies. The dispersion of the D mode decreases for both the electron and the hole doping, in agreement with the recent theory of Attaccalite et. al [Nano Letters, 10, 1172 (2010) ]. In order to observe D-band in the SLG samples, low energy argon ion bombardment was carried out. The D peak positions for variable carrier concentration using top-gated FET geometry are determined for three laser energies, 1. 96 eV, 2. 41 eV and 2. 54 eV. However, the dispersion of the 2 D band as a function of doping shows an opposite trend. This most curious result is quantitatively explained us¬ing a ﬁfth order process rather than the usual fourth order double resonant process usually considered for both the D and 2 D modes. Part B titled “Raman spectral features of second order 2 D’ and 2 D+G modes in doped graphene transistor” deals with doping dependence of 2 D’ and 2 D+G bands in single layer graphene transistor. The phonon frequency blue shifts for the hole doping and whereas it red shifts for electron doping, similar to the behaviour of the 2 D band. The linewidth of the 2 D+G combination mode too follows the 2 D trend increasing with doping while that of 2 D’ mode remains invariant. Chapter 6 : New Raman modes in graphene layers using 2 eV light Unique resonant Raman modes are identiﬁed at 1530 cm− 1 and 1445 cm− 1 in single, bi, tri and few layers graphene samples using 1. 96 eV (633 nm) laser excitation energy (EL). These modes are absent in Raman spectra using 2. 41 eV excitation energy. In addition, the defect-induced D band which is observed only from the edges of a pristine graphene sample, is observed from the entire sample region using E L = 1. 96 eV. Raman images with peak frequencies centered at 1530 cm− 1, 1445 cm− 1 and D band are recorded to show their correlations. With 1. 96 eV, we also observe a very clear splitting of the D mode with a separation of ∼ 32 cm− 1, recently predicted in the context of armchair graphene nanoribbons due to trigonal warping effect for phonon dispersion. All these findings suggest a resonance condition at ∼ 2 eVdue to homo-lumo gap of a defect in graphene energy band structure. Chapter 7 : Single and few layer MoS 2 : Resonant Raman and Phonon Renormalization Chapter 7 is divided into two parts. In Part A “Layer dependent Resonant Raman scattering of a few layer MoS 2 ”, we discuss resonant Raman scattering from single, bi, four and seven layers MoS 2. As bulk crystal of MoS 2 is thinned down to a few atomic layers, the indirect gap widens turning into a direct gap semiconductor with a band gap of 1. 96 eV in its monolayer form. We perform Raman study from MoS 2 layers employing 1. 96 eV laser excitation in order to achieve resonance condition. The prominent Raman modes for MoS 2 include first order E 12 g mode at ∼ 383 cm− 1 and the A 1 gmode at ∼ 408 cm− 1 which are observed under both non resonant and resonant conditions. A 1 gphonon involves the sulphur atomic vibration in opposite direction along the c axis (perpendicular to the basal plane) whereas for E 12 g mode, displacement of Mo and sulphur atoms are in the basal plane. With decreasing layer thickness, these two modes shifts in opposite direction, the E 12 g mode shows a blue shift of ∼ 2 cm− 1 while the A 1 gis red shifted by ∼ 4 cm− 1. Under resonant condi¬tion, apart from E 12 g and A 1 gmodes, several new Raman spectral features, which are completely absent in bulk, are observed in single, bi and few layer spectra pointing out the importance of Raman characterization. New Raman mode attributed to the longitudinal acoustic mode belonging to the phonon branch at M along the Γ-M direction of the Brillouin zone is seen at ∼ 230 cm− 1 for bi, four and seven layers. The most intense region of the spectrum around 460 cm− 1 is characterized by layer dependent frequencies and spectral intensities with the band near 460 cm− 1 becoming asymmetric as the sample thickness is increased. In the high frequency region between 510 - 630 cm− 1, new bands are seen for bi, four and seven layers. In Part B titled “Symmetry-dependent phonon renormalization in monolayer MoS 2 transistor”, we show that in monolayer MoS 2 the two Raman-active phonons, A 1 g and E 21 g, behave very differently as a function of doping induced by the top gate voltage in FET geometry. The FET achieves an on-off ratio of ∼ 105 for electron doping. We show that while E 12 g phonon is essentially unaffected, the A 1 gphonon is strongly influenced by the level of doping. We quantitatively understand our experimental results through the use of first-principles calculations to determine frequencies and electron-phonon coupling for both the phonons as a function of carrier concentration. We present symmetry arguments to explain why only A 1 g mode is renormalized significantly by doping. Our results bring out a quantitative under¬standing of electron-phonon interaction in single layer MoS 2...|$|E
