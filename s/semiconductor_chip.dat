25|$|Hart cosponsored the <b>Semiconductor</b> <b>Chip</b> Protection Act of 1984 with Senator Charles Mathias, {{which was}} signed into law. The act {{created a new}} {{category}} of intellectual property rights that makes the layouts of integrated circuits legally protected upon registration, and hence illegal to copy without permission. This protected Silicon Valley chips from cheap foreign imitations. Similar legislation had been proposed in every Congress since 1979. It led to Hart being called {{the leader of the}} Atari Democrats.|$|E
25|$|Intel Corporation (also {{known as}} Intel, stylized as intel) is an American {{multinational}} corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, in the Silicon Valley.

Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Lenovo, HP, and Dell.

25|$|Intel {{had also}} {{for a number}} of years been embroiled in litigation. US law did not {{initially}} recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology (circuit layouts), until the <b>Semiconductor</b> <b>Chip</b> Protection Act of 1984, a law sought by Intel and the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). During the late 1980s and 1990s (after this law was passed), Intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the 80386 CPU. The lawsuits were noted to significantly burden the competition with legal bills, even if Intel lost the suits. Antitrust allegations had been simmering since the early 1990s and had been the cause of one lawsuit against Intel in 1991. In 2004 and 2005, AMD brought further claims against Intel related to unfair competition.|$|E
25|$|Circuits with defined {{control voltage}} of the divider can {{compensate}} for the thermal drift of the LED in a RO, {{but not for the}} memory effect and thermal drift of the photoresistor. The latter compensation requires a second (reference) photoresistor, which is illuminated by the same light intensity, at the same temperature as the main (modulating) device. Best compensation is achieved when both photoresistors are formed on the same <b>semiconductor</b> <b>chip.</b> The reference photoresistor is included in a divider of stabilized voltage or in a measuring bridge. The error amplifier compares the voltage at the middle point of the divider with the target value and adjusts the controlling current. In the linear controlling regime the RO becomes an analog multiplier: the current through the photoresistor is proportional to the product of the voltage across the photoresistor and the control voltage.|$|E
25|$|Given their vertical-cavity geometry, VCSOAs are {{resonant}} cavity optical amplifiers that operate with the input/output signal entering/exiting normal to the wafer surface. In {{addition to their}} small size, the surface normal operation of VCSOAs leads {{to a number of}} advantages, including low power consumption, low noise figure, polarization insensitive gain, and the ability to fabricate high fill factor two-dimensional arrays on a single <b>semiconductor</b> <b>chip.</b> These devices are still {{in the early stages of}} research, though promising preamplifier results have been demonstrated. Further extensions to VCSOA technology are the demonstration of wavelength tunable devices. These MEMS-tunable vertical-cavity SOAs utilize a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based tuning mechanism for wide and continuous tuning of the peak gain wavelength of the amplifier. SOAs have a more rapid gain response, which is in the order of 1 to 100 ps.|$|E

25|$|A {{challenge}} {{most critical}} to analog IC design involves {{the variability of}} the individual devices built on the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>chip.</b> Unlike board-level circuit design which permits the designer to select devices that have each been tested and binned according to value, the device values on an IC can vary widely which are uncontrollable by the designer. For example, some IC resistors can vary ±20% and β of an integrated BJT can vary from 20 to 100. In the latest CMOS processes, β of vertical PNP transistors can even go below 1. To add to the design challenge, device properties often vary between each processed semiconductor wafer. Device properties can even vary significantly across each individual IC due to doping gradients. The underlying cause of this variability is that many semiconductor devices are highly sensitive to uncontrollable random variances in the process. Slight changes {{to the amount of}} diffusion time, uneven doping levels, etc. can have large effects on device properties.|$|E
