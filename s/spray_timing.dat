40|$|Poster abstractPhoma stem canker, {{a disease}} of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) caused by sibling {{pathogens}} Leptosphaeria maculans and L. biglobosa. Both pathogens follow a monocylic disease cycle that causes leaf spotting in autumn/winter and stem cankers in spring/summer. Most severe cankers decrease transportation of water and nutrients. Fungicides are important for phoma stem canker control. Triazole fungicides currently dominate the market, although reduced sensitivity in some plant pathogen species is a concern. Moreover, L. maculans and L. biglobosa have shown differing level of sensitivity to triazole fungicides. Therefore, increased knowledge on controlling phoma stem canker using non-triazole based fungicides is essential. Field trials were established for 2013 / 2014 cropping season. Four fungicides were applied: penthiopyrad, picoxystrobin, prothioconazole and a novel fungicide. <b>Spray</b> <b>timings</b> were divided into three sprays T 1 (phoma leaf spotting incidence ??? 10 %), T 2 (3 / 4 weeks post T 1) and T 3 (Sclerotinia). Phoma leaf spotting incidence and stem canker severity were recorded. In vitro sensitivity testing was done on one L. maculans (ME 24) and one L. biglobosa (68) isolate. Prothioconazole showed no noteworthy advantage over the novel fungicide in canker severity scoring. No significant difference in growth inhibition was observed between L. biglobosa and L. maculans (P ??? 0. 05) when treated with novel fungicide. Canker severity indicates that the novel fungicide has a similar efficacy to triazole fungicides. Fungicide sensitivity testing shows that L. biglobosa {{does not have an}} increased sensitivity to non-triazole fungicides. This interaction suggests that the novel fungicide could be used to control both L. maculans and L. biglobos...|$|R

Two experiments were performed to identify the ability of prothioconazole (Proline®, Bayer CropScience) at three timings to reduce FHB and resulting DON in harvested grain of wheat. Prothioconazole (150 g ha- 1) was applied to plots of wheat at GS 31, 39 and 65 in a full factorial design. Plots were inoculated with Fusarium-infected oat grain at GS 30 and mist-irrigated at GS 65 to encourage head blight development. Plots were assessed for head blight symptoms at GS 77 and harvested grain was analysed for yield, specific weight, thousand grain weight and DON. Factorial ANOVA identified prothioconazole applications at each timing resulted in significant reductions in FHB and DON. The control achieved with combinations of <b>spray</b> <b>timings</b> was additive with no significant interactions. The control of FHB at GS 31, GS 39 and GS 65 was 50, 58 and 83 % respectively. The reduction in FHB achieved by all three timings combined was 97 % compared to the fully untreated control plots. The reduction of DON after application of prothioconazole at GS 31, GS 39 and GS 65 was 27, 49 and 57 % respectively.

40|$|The northeastern pine zale is a moth of barrens {{habitats}} and pitch pine areas in eastern Pennsylvania. It is currently known from three sites in Pennsylvania, {{two in the}} southeast {{and one in the}} northeast. Northeastern pine zale can utilize a variety of pitch pine barrens, woodlands, and pine-oak forests. The larval food plant in Pennsylvania is pitch pine (Pinus rigida). The species is best collected at bait. More surveys are needed in pitch pine areas in appropriate habitat in the Appalachian Mountains and eastern Pennsylvania during the spring flight period (mid May to mid June). Current Threats: Fire is a potential threat to this species especially in June and July during the egg and active larval stages. However, fire is often necessary for maintaining open barrens.

50|$|Peach cultivars in Texas {{range in}} their {{requirements}} from 100 chilling units (FlordaGrande cultivar, zoned for low chill regions) to 1,000 units (Surecrop, zoned for high chill regions). Planting a low-chilling cultivar in a high-chill region risks {{loss of a}} year's harvest when an early bloom is hit by a spring frost. A high-chilling cultivar planted in a low-chill region will, quite likely, never fruit at all. A four-year study of Ruston Red Alabama peach, which has a threshold of 850 chilling units, demonstrated that a seasonal chilling deficiency of less than 50 units {{has no effect on}} harvest. Deficiency of 50 to 100 units may result in loss of up to 50% of expected harvest. Deficiency of 250 hours and more is a sure loss of practically whole harvest; the few fruit will be of very poor quality and have no market value. Rest-breaking agents (e.g. hydrogen cyanamide, trade name BudPro or Dormex), applied in spring, can partially mitigate the effects of insufficient chilling. BudPro can substitute for up to 300 hours of chilling, but an excessive <b>spraying</b> and <b>timing</b> error can easily damage the buds.Other products such as Dormex use stabilizing compounds.|$|R

Initial systematic surveys of radish producers near Melbourne, Victoria, indicated that crops irrigated overhead in the morning (0800 - 1200 h) had a lower incidence of white blister than those irrigated overhead in the evening (2000 - 2400 h). A field trial was conducted from July to November 2008 on a broccoli crop located west of Melbourne to determine the efficacy and economics of different practices used for white blister control, modifying irrigation timing, growing a resistant cultivar and <b>timing</b> <b>spray</b> applications based on Brassica(spot) (TM).

40|$|A {{model of}} the effect of foliar-applied {{fungicides}} on disease-induced yield loss is described, parameterised and tested. The effects of fungicides on epidemics of Septoria tritici (leaf blotch), Puccinia striiformis (yellow rust), Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (powdery mildew) and Puccinia triticina (brown rust) on winter wheat were simulated using dose-response curve parameters. Where two or more active substances were applied together, their joint action was estimated using an additive dose model where the active substances had the same mode of action or a multiplicative survival model where the modes of action differed. By coupling the model with models of wheat canopy growth and foliar disease published previously, it was possible to estimate disease-induced yield loss for a prescribed fungicide programme. The difference in green canopy area and, hence, interception of photosynthetically active radiation between simulated undiseased and diseased (but treated) crop canopies was used to estimate yield loss.

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{and tests}} novel approaches that {{significantly reduce the}} fungicide input necessary for potato late blight control while maintaining the required high level of disease control. The central premise is that fungicide inputs can be reduced by reducing dose rates on more resistant cultivars, by omitting applications on days when conditions are unsuitable for atmospheric transport of viable sporangia and by adapting the dose rate {{to the length of}} the predicted critical period. These concepts were implemented and tested in field experiments in 2007 and 2008 in the North Eastern potato growing region in the Netherlands which is known for its high potato late blight disease pressure. Field experiments contained three starch potato cultivars, representing a range in resistance to potato late blight from susceptible to highly resistant, and a series of decision rules determining <b>spray</b> <b>timing</b> and incorporating an increasing number of variables such as: remaining fungicide protection level, critical weather, atmospheric capacity for viable transport of sporangia and the length of the predicted critical period.

We established six 20 -m-diameter circular experimental plots on the landfill; three were spray irrigated {{as part of the}} operational system, and three remained as untreated control plots. We quantified the effects of leachate application on soil properties, soil solution chemistry, vegetative growth, and estimated solute leaching. The leachate had high mean levels of electrical conductivity (0. 6 – 0. 7 S m– 1), Cl (760 – 900 mg L– 1), and NH 4 –N (290 – 390 mg L– 1) but was low in metals and volatile organic compounds. High rates of leachate application in 2003 (32 cm) increased soil electrical conductivity and NO 3 –N leaching, so a sequential rotation of spray areas was implemented to limit total leachate application to 3 ̆c 9. 6 cm yr– 1 per spray area. Concentrations of NO 3 –N and leaching losses remained higher on irrigated plots in subsequent years but were substantially reduced by spray area rotation. Leachate irrigation increased plant biomass but did not significantly affect soil metal concentrations, and plant metal concentrations remained within normal ranges.

Soot located in the squish region or the region above the piston bowl are readily oxidized due to abundance of oxygen. Portions of fuel are burnt in the region about the piston bowl or squish for both spray angles of 150 ?? and 70 ??. Soot located within the piston bowl is oxidized at a much slower rate due to deficient of oxygen after combustion. Soot emissions are mainly due to soot remaining within in the piston bowl at the end of combustion cycle. Any strategy that pushes soot out of the piston bowl can improve the oxidation process, thus, reducing soot emission. Extra oxygen in biodiesel also helps in reducing the emission. The effects of variable cone angle spray on the performance of a diesel engine are studied. Using a variable cone angle injection extends the range of injection time without engine wall wetting, which decreases soot and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions. The numerical predictions show a 10 % improvement in thermal efficiency without compromising NOx and soot emissions. The study shows that the evaporation of the fuel affects the ignition behavior and combustion quality. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the evaporation and mixing processes is essential for further improvement in engine performance. A multi- component droplet evaporation model, as efficient as a traditional zero-dimensional model, yet preserving the correct description of the underlying physical process is developed in this study. The continuous thermodynamics formulation is used, for which the fuel (or liquid mixture) is described using a probability distribution function. The variation of composition in both liquid and vapor phases is represented by tracing the changes of the probability distribution function parameters. In the present study, the gamma distribution is used to represent the fuel fractions, and, the composition is tracked by tracing the mean and standard deviation of the distribution function. Finite diffusion, internal circulation, surface regression and high pressure effects are all accounted for. The model is shown to reproduce in a satisfactorily manner, experimental measurements adopted from the literature. The model is applied to predict the evaporation of single component (distribution) and multi-component droplets. The results show that the proposed model predicts the important distillation characteristics of practical fuel, which cannot be reproduced by a single component model...|$|R
40|$|Trials were {{conducted}} in 2011 and 2012 at the Institute of Forage Crops, Pleven, Bulgaria, in order to study the imaginal and possible ovicidal effect of some insecticides against Bruchus pisorum under field conditions. Treatments with insecticides were started after {{the appearance of the}} first pea weevils eggs on pods located on the bottom two nodes. It was found that treatment with acetamiprid; thiacloprid; thiacloprid+deltamethrin; 50 g cypermethrin+ 480 g chlorpyrifosethyl, 50 g cypermethrin+ 500 g chlorpyrifosethyl and zeta-cypermethrin resulted in the cessation of additional oviposition on the lower nodes by Bruchus pisorum, due to the toxic effect of the insecticides on the pea weevil. It was found that spraying with acetamiprid and zeta-cypermethrin was the most effective. These insecticides significantly reduced the proportion of infected pods in comparison with the proportion of pods with eggs before the treatment by 30. 2 and 27. 4 % and by 15. 8 and 24. 0 % in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The use of acetamiprid and zeta-cypermethrin was also associated with the lowest percentage of infected seeds (21. 7 and 23. 6 %, respectively), with the lowest percentage of infected seed in infected pods (40. 5 and 42. 5 %, respectively) and the highest weight of 1000 infected seeds (161. 94 and 182. 04 g, respectively). It was concluded that the management of pea weevils in the crop with acetamiprid and zetacypermethrin can lead to satisfactory results when <b>spray</b> <b>timing</b> is chosen when the first eggs are visible. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{integrated}} pest management (IPM) of hot pepper, field {{study was conducted in}} Hwasung from 2010 to 2012 and an IPM system was developed to help growers decide when to apply pesticides to control anthracnose, tobacco budworm, Phytophthora blight, bacterial wilt, and bacterial leaf spot. The three field treatments consisted of IPM sprays following the forecast model advisory, a periodic spray at 7 -to- 10 -day intervals, and no spray (control). The number of annual pesticide applications for the IPM treatment ranged from six to eight, whereas the plots subjected to the periodic treatment received pesticide 11 or 12 times annually for three years. Compared to the former strategy, our improved IPM strategy features more intense pest management, with frequent spraying for anthracnose and mixed spraying for tobacco budworm or Phytophthora blight. The incidences for no pesticide control in 2010, 2011, and 2012 were 91, 97. 6, and 41. 4 %, respectively. Conversely, the incidences for the IPM treatment for those years were 7. 6, 62. 6, and 2 %, and the yields from IPM-treated plots were 48. 6 kg, 12. 1 kg, and 48. 8 kg. The incidence and yield in the IPM-treated plots were almost the same as those of the periodic treatment except in 2011, in which no unnecessary sprays were given, meaning that the IPM control was quite successful. From reviewing eight years of field work, sophisticated forecasts that optimize pesticide <b>spray</b> <b>timing</b> reveal that reliance on pesticides can be reduced without compromising yield. Eco-friendly strategies can be implemented in the pest management of hot pepper...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} thesis, {{conducted}} over six growing seasons (2003 - 2008), is to define new measures for reducing the use of fungicides and in particular, copper fungicides, for the control of apple scab (V. inaequalis) in organic apple production. Special emphasis is put on primary scab infection control during spring season. An original approach is proposed for defining a specific <b>spray</b> <b>timing</b> involving spraying during the infection processes, especially before fungal penetration, determined by the RIMpro software warning system. This ‘during-infection’ spray strategy allows reducing from 30 to 50 % the amount of fungicide usually used for effective apple scab control, on high scab-susceptible cultivars. The field study shows that six alternative products (e. g., potassium bicarbonate and lime sulphur), among 60 products tested, {{have the potential to}} reduce copper use. However, copper use, even with low doses, seems to be still necessary in presence of scab-susceptible cultivars. The results obtained in these experiments could not be attributed to the specific technical performances of the tunnel sprayer used, which however, offer valuable environmental benefits. On the basis of the present study, the organic management system seems a good farming approach for maintaining soil quality with regard to biological indicators. This work shows and draws {{attention to the fact that}} (i) planting cultivars with polygenic scab-resistance traits, (ii) increasing emphasis on sanitation practices aimed at reducing initial inoculum in autumn, and (iii) applying an accurate spray strategy in spring, as defined in the present study, are the three most promising approaches for substantial further reductions in protection products fully compliant with international organic crop production standards...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2016. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Perry Li. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 201222 pages. Integrating {{wind and solar}} energy into the electric power grid is challenging due to variations in wind speed and solar intensity. Moreover, to maintain the stability of electric power grid, there must be always {{a balance between the}} energy production and consumption which is not easy since both of them undergo drastic variation over time. Large scale energy storage systems can solve these issues by storing the extra energy when supply exceeds demand power, and regenerating energy and send it to the electric grid when demand power surpasses the supply. This dissertation focuses on the optimal design and control of a new type of Com- pressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) system that is especially applicable to off-shore wind turbines. The system is designed such that it addresses the need for a compact and energy dense storage system with high roundtrip efficiency for large-scale energy storage applications. The contributions of this work are also beneficial for designing power dense gas compressors/expanders with high thermal efficiency. The material of this thesis can be divided into two parts: In the first part, different approaches and techniques are studied to increase the power density of a liquid piston air compressor/expander system without sacrificing its efficiency. These methods are then combined and optimized {{in the form of a}} single design to maximize the performance of an air compressor/expander unit which is the most critical component of the energy storage system under investigation. In the second part, component-level and supervisory-level controllers are designed and developed for the combined wind turbine and energy storage system such that both short-term and long-term objectives are achieved. Improvement of thermal efficiency of an air compressor/expander is achievable by increasing heat transfer between air under compression/expansion and its surrounding solid material in the compression/expansion chamber. This will prevent heat loss by reducing air temperature rise/drop during the compression/expansion phase. Here, liquid piston (instead of conventional solid piston) is used in the compression/expansion chamber where the chamber volume is filled with porous material that increases heat transfer area by an order of magnitude, and therefore improves the thermal efficiency. Since the liquid piston is driven by a variable displacement pump/motor, optimal compression/expansion trajectories are calculated and applied to further increase heat transfer and improve the performance of the system. This improvement is verified both analytically and experimentally. Based on numerical results, utilizing porous material in the compression/expansion chamber with optimized distribution, combined with the corresponding optimal compression/expansion trajectory has the potential to increase the power density by more than 20 folds, without reducing its thermal efficiency. An alternative method to increase heat transfer is to introduce micro-size water droplets (through water spray) in the chamber during air compression/expansion process. Since water has a high heat capacity, the generated heat during compression can be absorbed by water and therefore reduce the temperature rise of air during compression. The same phenomenon but in opposite direction happens in expansion case (heat transfer from water droplets to air) that prevents air from getting very cold which causes poor efficiency. A numerical model is developed and used to study the effect of water <b>spray</b> amount and <b>timing</b> on the thermal performance of air compressor/expander. The opti- mal <b>timing</b> of water <b>spray</b> is calculated to maximize the effectiveness of a given amount of water that is sprayed into the air. The optimally designed liquid piston air compressor/expander unit is then combined with the other components of energy storage system, as well as a wind turbine. Nonlinear techniques are used to design plant-level controllers in order to coordinate different parts in the system, and to achieve both short term objectives (maintaining the frequency of electric generator while capturing maximum wind power) and long term objectives (tracking the power demanded from electric grid and regulating the pressure in the storage vessel). Finally, the combined wind turbine and energy storage system is studied for maximizing the total achievable revenue by optimizing the storage/regeneration sequence according to varying electricity price and available wind power (given storage size and its nominal power). According to the results, an increase of up to 137 % in total revenue is achievable by equipping a conventional wind turbine with a CAES system while tracking the calculated optimal storage/regeneration sequence. Additionally, by incorporating the price of different components of energy storage system, a study is conducted to find the effect of system size on maximum achievable revenue that can lead to the economical size selection of the energy storage system...|$|R
40|$|Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato, one of {{the most}} {{economically}} damaging pathogens of strawberry, is the primary causal agent of anthracnose fruit rot (AFR). A key challenge in managing AFR is detecting the pathogen on asymptomatic plants. To meet this need, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed that incorporated two sets of primers: LITSG 1 targeted on the ITS region of ribosomal DNA and Ltub 2 on the β-tubulin 2 gene. In pure culture assays, Ltub 2 was specific for detection of C. acutatum, whereas LITSG 1 detected C. acutatum and two additional anthracnose pathogens, C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae. LITSG 1 had 10 -fold higher sensitivity (20 pg of mycelial DNA) than Ltub 2 (200 pg) in detection of C. acutatum from pure cultures. The LAMP assay was also tested on asymptomatic greenhouse and field plants, and was shown to have strong potential for detection of C. acutatum in planta. Field experiments were conducted at the ISU Horticulture Research Station near Gilbert, IA, during the 2012, 2013, and 2014 growing seasons to validate an AFR warning system that had been previously developed and tested in Florida. Five treatments included a factorial combination of two <b>spray</b> <b>timing</b> methods (warning system and calendar-based) and two fungicides (captan and pyraclostrobin), plus a non-sprayed control. The day-neutral strawberry cultivar Tristar was spray-inoculated with C. acutatum conidia {{at the beginning of the}} bloom period. In each year, the AFR warning system saved one to two fungicide sprays compared to calendar-based treatments. In general, the warning system-based treatments controlled AFR as well as calendar-based sprays. The results provide evidence that the Florida warning system may be valuable for helping Midwest strawberry growers to reduce fungicide use against AFR. Finally, I developed a case study entitled “Strawberry anthracnose: managing a hidden menace” to challenge students to help an Iowa strawberry grower decide how to manage AFR with fewer fungicide sprays. When students study this case, they learn how plants become infected and how a disease-warning system uses information about the weather to help growers manage diseases with less reliance on fungicides. The case study was tested by Iowa State University horticulture and plant pathology undergraduate students, and feedback from students and instructors has been integrated to improve the case study...|$|E

The twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, is a worldwide pest of numerous agronomic and horticultural plants. Sulfur fungicides are known to induce outbreaks of this pest on several crops, although mechanisms associated with sulfur-induced mite outbreaks are largely unknown. Studies were conducted during 2007 – 2009 in Oregon and Washington hop yards to evaluate the effect of timing of sulfur applications on T. urticae and key predators. In both regions, applications of sulfur made relatively late in the growing season (mid-June to mid-July) were associated with the greatest exacerbation of spider mite outbreaks, particularly in the upper canopy of the crop. The severity of mite outbreaks was closely associated with sulfur applications made during a relatively narrow time period coincident with the early exponential phase of spider mite increase and rapid host growth. A nonlinear model relating mean cumulative mite days during the time of sulfur sprays to the percent increase in total cumulative mite days (standardized to a nontreated plot) explained 58 % of the variability observed in increased spider mite severity related to sulfur <b>spray</b> <b>timing.</b> Spatial patterns of spider mites in the Oregon plots indicated similar dispersal of motile stages of spider mites among leaves treated with sulfur versus nontreated leaves; however, in two of three years, eggs were less aggregated on leaves of sulfur-treated plants, pointing to enhanced dispersal. Apart from one experiment in Washington, relatively few predatory mites were observed during the course of these studies, and sulfur-induced mite outbreaks generally occurred irrespective of predatory mite abundance. Collectively, these studies indicate sulfur induces mite outbreaks through direct or indirect effects on T. urticae, mostly independent of predatory mite abundance or toxicity to these predators. Avoidance of exacerbation of spider mite outbreaks by sulfur sprays was achieved by carefully timing applications to periods of low spider mite abundance and slower host development, which is generally early to mid-spring for hop...|$|E
