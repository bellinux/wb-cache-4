40|$|We {{bring new}} {{evidence}} {{to bear on}} McCloskey's argument that farmers in the open fields reduced risk by <b>scattering</b> their land <b>holdings.</b> The new evidence is the grain output {{from a number of}} plots of land in two French villages, Onnaing and Quarouble, during the years 1701 - 1790. When combined with prices and wages, the output figures provide financial returns for each plot of land, and financial theory then allows us to construct land portfolios that minimize portfolio variance for a given mean return. The virtue of using returns (rather than simple output correlations) is that the returns take into account the price fluctuations farmers encountered. They also allow us to distinguish the benefits of scattering from those produced by crop diversification and they do so with greater accuracy than the output figures. In the end, the returns demonstrate that <b>scattering</b> of land <b>holdings</b> provided relatively little insurance. The real reduction in risk came not from scattering but from the diversification across crops inherent in the three-field system...|$|R

40|$|Using {{the case}} of Ethiopia, {{the purpose of this}} study is to propose a {{strategy}} for the compliance with SPS measures for a large poor country with <b>scattered</b> small <b>holdings</b> to reduce the cost of compliance and at the same time to expand exports rapidly. Most previous studies on the compliance have concentrated on the need for the provision of facilities for food safety control at the border or recommended the application of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) Codes of OECD to such poor countries. Considering the complexity of SPS system, little attention has been paid to inefficiencies of the control at the border or practical difficulties and time needed for implementing GAP in such countries. The author proposes a development oriented, preventive, and proactive and forward looking strategy for the compliance with SPS measures for which an alternative organization of the supply chain is required. Unlike most previous studies, he makes distinctions between the facilities and requirements for the compliance, and the “targets” in the supply chain, from farms to the port of exportation, for which actions are require...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} land tenure systems, farm sizes, agricultural productivity and innovation in Imo State, Nigeria. Specifically the {{study examined}} the socio-economic characteristics of farmers, estimated the farm size of the farmers, identified reasons for not practicing mechanized farming, identified different innovations available to the farmers and identified the factors that affected agricultural productivity. Five communities were chosen randomly and from each of these communities, twenty farmers were randomly chosen. Data were collected, collated and analyzed using relevant techniques such as means, percentages, frequency distribution and multiple regression analysis. The results showed that 85 % of the respondents practiced individual land tenure system alone. It was also revealed that the laws of inheritance and increase in population led to the subdivision and fragmentation of existing farmland {{in such a manner}} that the sizes of farm holdings discouraged agricultural commercialization. Also, it was found that fragmentation led to a great distance between the plot which increased the waste in man-hour and energy. It was also shown that mechanization of agriculture was impracticable under land fragmentation and adoption of modern innovation was reduced since just 35. 0 % of the respondents claimed to have adopted other forms of innovation. Lastly, the null hypothesis was rejected concluding that socio-economic factors affected the farmer’s productivity in the area. It was recommended that formation of cooperatives by farmers is an imperative in farm land consolidation of the <b>scattered</b> farm <b>holdings</b> into economic size to encourage large scale operation and bulk input sourcing and procurement. land Tenure system, farm size, Agricultural productivity, innovation, Productivity Analysis,...|$|R
40|$|Life on coral atolls {{can be very}} precarious. The sand cay islets are low-lying (in {{the main}} less than 2 m above high water) and small.

Around this time the Royal Dublin Society was sending Inspectors around the area to teach best practice. Coral sand and seaweed were used to improve the soil. In Bantry Bay boats were engaged in coral sand, it would take three hours to load a boat and the cargo would fetch 8s. There were also twenty boats involved {{in the collection of}} seaweed, with a crew of two men and two boys earning 6-7s in the season. There was reorganisation of <b>scattered</b> land <b>holdings.</b> This tied in with the Bandon Estate taking over the Evanson holdings in Durrus. It is not clear if this was because of lease expiry or purchase. The Bandon Estate invested heavily, rebuilt the village in its present form in the 1850s and carried out land improvements. The records of the Dohertys, managers of the Estate would suggest a commercial and competent management, however the nature of the land and the poor condition of many of the tenants may have militated against the success of this. In 1860 a memorial was presented in Bantry to establish a branch of the National Bank, it was pointed out that {{there was a lack of}} coins and notes restricting commerce. Eventually in March 1865 the Munster and Leinster Bank established a branch in Bantry. There was a further period of distress in 1860.

In 1204, William de Rudge charged them 4 marks and an annual rent of three pence to consolidate and extend their holding, exchanging land he had given them earlier.

60|$|There are paradoxes {{permissible}} for the redressing {{of a bad}} {{balance in}} criticism, and which may safely even be emphasized {{so long as they}} are not isolated. One of these I have called {{at the beginning of this}} chapter the strength of the weak kings. And there is a complement of it, even in this crisis of the Norman mastery, which might well be called the weakness of the strong kings. William of Normandy succeeded immediately, he did not quite succeed ultimately; there was in his huge success a secret of failure that only bore fruit long after his death. It was certainly his single aim to simplify England into a popular autocracy, like that growing up in France; with that aim he <b>scattered</b> the feudal <b>holdings</b> in scraps, demanded a direct vow from the sub-vassals to himself, and used any tool against the barony, from the highest culture of the foreign ecclesiastics to the rudest relics of Saxon custom. But the very parallel of France makes the paradox startlingly apparent. It is a proverb that the first French kings were puppets; that the mayor of the palace was quite insolently the king of the king. Yet it is certain that the puppet became an idol; a popular idol of unparalleled power, before which all mayors and nobles bent or were broken. In France arose absolute government, the more because it was not precisely personal government. The King was already a thing--like the Republic. Indeed the mediæval Republics were rigid with divine right. In Norman England, perhaps, the government was too personal to be absolute. Anyhow, there is a real though recondite sense in which William the Conqueror was William the Conquered. When his two sons were dead, the whole country fell into a feudal chaos almost like that before the Conquest. In France the princes who had been slaves became something exceptional like priests; and one of them became a saint. But somehow our greatest kings were still barons; and by that very energy our barons became our kings.|$|R
