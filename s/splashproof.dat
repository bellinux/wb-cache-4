50|$|With {{the laser}} barcode reader or GPS {{accessory}} attached, the G700SE is only certified as <b>splashproof.</b> With either the optional wide angle adapter or laser barcode reader (G700SE only) attached, shock protection declines to 1.5 meters, {{and with the}} GPS unit to 1.2 meters.|$|E
50|$|Design {{features}} of the cranes of NMF are a <b>splashproof</b> closed crane housing in welded steel construction, in which all major units are housed. Many cranes offer the so-called 2-line operation on the hook every time a charge. This eliminates the change of shear. Due mostly two pump units and equipment with an auxiliary hoist, a certain reliability is ensured.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to the European Union's MORE-project (Mobile Rescue Phone), Benefon changed its focus to GSM+GPS mobile telematics equipment. The company launched what it later called [...] "the first mobile phone and a GPS navigator integrated in one product", the Benefon Esc!, in late 1999, followed by the Benefon Track in 2000. The Esc! was <b>splashproof</b> and featured a large, greyscale LCD. Esc! allowed for users to load maps onto the phone, to trace their position and movement, and to call or send their coordinates via SMS {{to a list of}} set numbers by setting an [...] "Emergency Key". It also featured a [...] "Friend Find" [...] service, whereby users with Esc! handsets could track each other's locations directly on their handset display. In some markets this feature was implemented online.|$|E
50|$|It has an extra-low {{dispersion}} lens which zooms from 37.5 to 150 mm, and an 11-point autofocus system. The {{camera is}} almost entirely automatic, but it does allow spot metering, 6 flash modes and infinity focus. It has an infra red sensor {{to allow it to}} be used with a proprietary remote control. It also has a self-timer. The manufacturer claims an all weather design, and this is written on top of the camera, by this they mean it is <b>splashproof.</b> It is still vulnerable to damage from direct sunlight and extremes of temperature (below -10 and above 40 degrees Celsius). It has a sliding lens cover, which acts as an on/off switch. It also blocks the viewfinder when closed, so the viewfinder can only be used when the camera is on and the flash charged, meaning the battery is being drained. It accepts film speeds between ISO 50 and 3200 using DX coding. Non DX-Coded-film is set at ISO 100. It uses one lithium battery size 123A.|$|E
5000|$|Trischler {{noted that}} {{durability}} {{was a key}} selling point in emerging markets, specifically citing the device's use of Gorilla Glass 3, an anti-smudge screen coating, and a similar <b>splashproof</b> coating to the Moto G—which he also noted were attributes that are not normally seen in such low-end products. The company also emphasized its efforts {{to reduce the cost}} of constructing the phone—expanding upon those used by the Moto G. Tritschler stated that these measures must be designed [...] "...right into the product; you can’t just cut the price." [...] Overall, the Moto E is 40% cheaper than the Moto G. The version of Android shipped on the device, 4.4.2 [...] "KitKat", contains a number of changes designed to optimize the operating system for low-end devices such as the Moto G and E. To emphasize the device's performance, Motorola argued in a demonstration that the Moto E was slightly faster than the high-end Samsung Galaxy S4 at performing basic tasks such as launching certain apps (such as the camera and web browser) and going back to the home screen from an app.|$|E
