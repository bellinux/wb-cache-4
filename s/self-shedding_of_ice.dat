40|$|Results of {{theoretical}} and experimental studies on failure <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> during short-time creep {{are reported in}} this work. Deformation and failure <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> under applied load are treated as a stochastic process composed of discrete events of the occurrence and development of microdefects in the crystal structure <b>of</b> <b>ice.</b> Models <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> deformation have been developed in which the magnitude and duration of stresses and the dependence on temperature have been taken into account. The functional relation between the microprocess of the accumulation of brittle structural defects and the macroprocess <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> deformation has been confirmed. The possibility of monitoring and predicting the stress strain state <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> masses {{with the help of}} acoustic emission records has been demonstrated. It has been established that the fundamental theoretical propositions are applicable to vibrocreep and to failure <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> under cyclic loads. The results of dynamic loading experiments confirm that the processes <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> failure during static and dynamic loading are essentially similar, and that the maximum number of structural defects is the proper criterion <b>of</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>ice.</b> This monograph is intended for specialists dealing with physico-mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> under failure loads.
