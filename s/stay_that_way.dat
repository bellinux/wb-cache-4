5|$|To create Lou Bloom's character, Gilroy {{explored}} {{the ideas of}} unemployment and capitalism. He wanted to portray Lou as someone who perpetually focuses on the precepts of capitalism, and how these thoughts not only give him sanity, but also push him over the edge. Gilroy did not give Lou a character arc, as he believed that people develop their ideals {{at a certain point}} in their life, and that they <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> regardless of what happens. This is depicted in the opening scene of the film, when Lou attacks a security guard, which informs the audience that Lou is a criminal, and not someone who lost their morality {{as a result of the}} job. Lou's backstory was purposefully left out of the script, as Gilroy felt that without one, the audience would create their own backstories for Lou, and become more engaged with the character. Gilroy remarked that Lou eventually became a vehicle for the ideas and themes that he wanted to express in the film.|$|E

Three years later, the Kings completed the transition back to the classic black and silver by unveiling a new away jersey, which unlike the home jersey, features a black and silver tail stripe. The Kings script from their 1988–98 logo returned on the helmets, and would <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> until 2013, when they were replaced by the current Kings script.|$|E

Yet despite this, Italy {{was still able to}} salvage an important 1–0 victory. Norway would ultimately pay a price for their inability to take advantage of Pagliuca's dismissal. With the four teams level on points, the final two group games would each have to finish as draws for things to <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Republic of Ireland made it through after a dreary 0–0 draw with Norway; midfielders Massaro and Bernal traded strikes as Italy and Mexico played to a 1–1 draw.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for Canadian-based website Jam!, Andrew Carver praised the {{different}} sounds on Supernature, {{which range from}} [...] "a blend of future noise" [...] to [...] "crushed velvet corruption"; he described the album as [...] "one sharp recording". Jessica Suarez of Spin magazine compared [...] "Ooh La La" [...] to Black Cherrys [...] "Strict Machine", saying that [...] "Ooh La La" [...] sounds [...] "so simplistic that [...] minimalist repetition occasionally teeters over into redundancy". She praised [...] "Ride a White Horse" [...] and [...] "Fly Me Away" [...] for featuring Alison Goldfrapp's [...] "velvet-soft vocals, which <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> even when heavily processed". A less favourable reception came from Stylus Magazine reviewer Edward Oculicz, who stated [...] "Supernature {{is not a great}} album" [...] and called several of its tracks too [...] "dull".|$|E

500|$|Aristotle {{provided}} a philosophical {{discussion of the}} concept of a force {{as an integral part of}} Aristotelian cosmology. In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different [...] "natural places" [...] therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their [...] "natural place" [...] (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to [...] "natural motion", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general.|$|E

Unlike Ernie Pyle, Ernie Pike survives the war and is referenced as a veteran in other stories by Pratt. The face of Ernie Pike resembles that of Oesterheld himself. This {{was caused by a}} misunderstanding during the period of designing of the character: when Oesterheld was describing to Pratt the positive traits of the new character, he ended saying [...] "Make him like me!".

Critics have argued that this statistic is indicative of misleading coverage by the U.S. media since viewers in other countries {{were less likely to}} have these beliefs.

Ortiz de Dominguez sent word to Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla in Dolores, Guanajuato that the plot was discovered.

2500|$|In 1935, at age 34, Arthur starred {{opposite}} Edward G. Robinson in {{the gangster}} farce The Whole Town's Talking, also directed by Ford, and her popularity began to rise.

By the time of the film's release, her hair, naturally brunette throughout the silent film portion of her career, was bleached blonde and would mostly <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> She was known for maneuvering to be photographed and filmed almost exclusively from the left; Arthur felt that her left was her best side, and worked hard to keep it in the fore. Director Frank Capra recalled producer Harry Cohn's description of Jean Arthur's imbalanced profile: [...] "half of it's angel, and the other half horse." [...] Her next few films, Party Wire (1935), Public Hero No. 1 (1935) and If You Could Only Cook (1935), did not match the success of The Whole Town's Talking, but they all brought the actress positive reviews. In his review for The New York Times, critic Andre Sennwald praised Arthur's performance in Public Hero No. 1, writing that she [...] "is as refreshing a change from the routine it-girl as Joseph Calleia is in his own department." [...] Another critic wrote of her performance in If You Could Only Cook that [...] " [...] outstanding as she effortlessly slips from charming comedienne to beautiful romantic." [...] With her now apparent rise to fame, Arthur was able to extract several contractual concessions from Harry Cohn, such as script and director approval and the right to make films for other studios.|$|E
