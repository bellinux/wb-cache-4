A characteristic often seen in an X-ray is [...] Codman's triangle, which is basically a <b>subperiosteal</b> lesion formed when the periosteum is raised due to the tumor.

2500|$|Sinus {{infection}} {{can spread}} through anastomosing veins or by direct extension to close structures. Orbital complications were categorized by Chandler et al. into five stages {{according to their}} severity (see table). Contiguous spread to the orbit may result in periorbital cellulitis, <b>subperiosteal</b> abscess, orbital cellulitis, and abscess. Orbital cellulitis can complicate acute ethmoiditis if anterior and posterior ethmoidal veins thrombophlebitis enables {{the spread of the}} infection to the lateral or orbital side of the ethmoid labyrinth. Sinusitis may extend to the central nervous system, where it may cause cavernous sinus thrombosis, retrograde meningitis, and epidural, subdural, and brain abscesses. Orbital symptoms frequently precede intracranial spread of the infection [...] Other complications include sinobronchitis, maxillary osteomyelitis, and frontal bone osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis of the frontal bone often originates from a spreading thrombo-phlebitis. A periostitis of the frontal sinus causes an osteitis and a periostitis of the outer membrane, which produces a tender, puffy swelling of the forehead.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{infantile}} cortical hyperostosis, biopsy shows inflammation of the periosteum and adjacent soft tissues. After this resolves, the periosteum remains thickened, and <b>subperiosteal</b> immature lamellar bone can be seen on biopsy, while the bone marrow spaces contain vascular fibrous tissue. Eventually the inflammation and <b>subperiosteal</b> changes resolve, and hyperplasia of lamellar cortical bone can be seen.|$|E

50|$|Tessier, {{who had his}} {{background}} in the craniofacial surgery, made the step to a <b>subperiosteal</b> dissection via a coronal incision. In 1979, Tessier demonstrated that the <b>subperiosteal</b> undermining of the superior and lateral orbital rims allowed the elevation of the soft tissue and eyebrows with better results than the classic face-lifting. The objective was to elevate the soft tissue over the underlying skeleton to re-establish the patient's youthful appearance.|$|E
50|$|The <b>subperiosteal</b> {{facelift}} {{technique is}} done by vertically lifting the soft tissues of the face, completely separating it from the underlying facial bones and elevating it to a more esthetically pleasing position, correcting deep nasolabial folds and sagging cheeks. The technique is often combined with standard techniques, which provide a long-lasting rejuvenation of the face and is done in all age groups. The difference between this and other lifts is that the <b>subperiosteal</b> facelift has {{a longer period of}} facial swelling after the procedure.|$|E

Pets can be reservoirs and pass on MRSA to people. In some cases, the infection can be symptomatic and the pet can suffer a MRSA infection. Health departments recommend that the pet be taken to the veterinarian if MRSA infections keep occurring in the people who have contact with the pet.|$|E
50|$|Purpose of this {{treatment}} {{option is to}} straighten the abnormal radius. To do this, an 8 cm incision is made from the wrist crease at the palmair radial side. The approach is made passing the Flexor carpi radialis with detachment of the Pronator quadratus muscle from the radius. Now the Vickers ligament release is done. After this the periosteum is elevated and a crescent-shaped osteotomy, concave at the end, is marked on the bone. Now the radius is cut dome shaped and straightened. The distal end of the radius stays attached to the ulna. The dome shape of the osteotomy allows adequate bony contact for stability and a <b>subperiosteal</b> void for rapid healing.|$|E
5000|$|Codman {{triangle}} (previously {{referred to}} as Codman's triangle) is the triangular area of new <b>subperiosteal</b> bone that is created when a lesion, often a tumour, raises the periosteum away from the bone. [...] A Codman triangle is not actually a full triangle. Instead, it is often a pseudotriangle on radiographic findings, with ossification on the original bone and one additional side of the triangle, which forms a two sided triangle with one open side. This two sided appearance is generated due to a tumor (or growth) that is growing at a rate which is faster than the periosteum can grow or expand, so instead of dimpling, the periosteum tears away and provides ossification on the second edge of the triangle.|$|E
50|$|Pott's puffy tumor, first {{described}} by Sir Percivall Pott in 1760, {{is a rare}} clinical entity characterized by <b>subperiosteal</b> abscess associated with osteomyelitis. It is characterized by an osteomyelitis of the frontal bone, either direct or through haematogenic spread. This results in a swelling on the forehead, hence the name. The infection can also spread inwards, leading to an intracranial abscess. Pott's puffy tumor {{can be associated with}} cortical vein thrombosis, epidural abscess, subdural empyema, and brain abscess. The cause of vein thrombosis is explained by venous drainage of the frontal sinus, which occurs through diploic veins, which communicate with the dural venous plexus; septic thrombi can potentially evolve from foci within the frontal sinus and propagate through this venous system. This type of chronic osteomyelitis of the frontal bone is confused with acute sub-periosteal abscess of the frontal bone, which presents as a discrete collection over the frontal sinus.|$|E

50|$|Within the femur of Thrinaxodon, {{there is}} no major region of the bone that is made of parallel-fibred tissues, however, {{there is a small}} ring of parallel-fibred bone within the mid-cortex. The {{remainder}} of the femur is made of fibro-lamellar tissue, however the globular osteocyte lacunae become much more organized and the primary osteons assume less vasculature than many other bones as you begin to approach the <b>subperiosteal</b> surface. The femur contains very few bony trabeculae. The humerus differs from the femur in many regards, one of which being that there is a more extensive network of bony trabeculae in the humerus near the meduallary cavity of the bone. The globular osteocyte lacunae become more flattened as you get {{closer and closer to the}} midshaft of the humerus. While the vasculature is present, the humerus contains no secondary osteons. The radii and ulnae of Thrinaxodon represent roughly the same histological patterns. In contrast to the humerii and femora, the parallel-fibred region is far more distinct in the distal bones of the forelimb. The medullary cavities are surrounded by multiple layers of very poorly vascularized endosteal lamellar tissue, along with very large cavities near the medullary cavity of the metaphyses.|$|E
50|$|With prompt treatment, it is {{possible}} to cure mastoiditis. Seeking medical care early is important. However, it is difficult for antibiotics to penetrate to the interior of the mastoid process and so it may not be easy to cure the infection; it also may recur. Mastoiditis has many possible complications, all connected to the infection spreading to surrounding structures. Hearing loss is likely, or inflammation of the labyrinth of the inner ear (labyrinthitis) may occur, producing vertigo and an ear ringing may develop along with the hearing loss, making it more difficult to communicate. The infection may also spread to the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), causing facial-nerve palsy, producing weakness or paralysis of some muscles of facial expression, {{on the same side of}} the face. Other complications include Bezold's abscess, an abscess (a collection of pus surrounded by inflamed tissue) behind the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the neck, or a <b>subperiosteal</b> abscess, between the periosteum and mastoid bone (resulting in the typical appearance of a protruding ear). Serious complications result if the infection spreads to the brain. These include meningitis (inflammation of the protective membranes surrounding the brain), epidural abscess (abscess between the skull and outer membrane of the brain), dural venous thrombophlebitis (inflammation of the venous structures of the brain), or brain abscess.|$|E
40|$|Chondromyxoid fibroma {{is a rare}} {{cartilage}} tumor {{that represents}} less than 1 % of all bone tumors. When in a long bone, it is usually an intramedullary lesion that is eccentrically located in the metaphyseal region. Chondromyxoid fibroma may also have unusual presentations. These include intracortical lesions and <b>subperiosteal</b> lesions. There have been 14 reported cases of intracortical chondromyxoid fibroma, {{but there have been}} only four reports of <b>subperiosteal</b> lesions. A <b>subperiosteal</b> location, therefore, is extremely rare for a chondromyxoid fibroma. We present two new cases of <b>subperiosteal</b> chondromyxoid fibroma. Given its rarity, chondromyxoid fibroma is often not in the differential diagnosis of a painful, <b>subperiosteal</b> scalloped lesion in a long bone. Other entities such as periosteal chondroma, periosteal myxoma, <b>subperiosteal</b> ganglion cyst, or <b>subperiosteal</b> osteoid osteoma {{are more likely to be}} considered.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to determine the prevalence, distribution, and thickness of physiologic <b>subperiosteal</b> new bone formation in neonates and infants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-detail postmortem skeletal radiologic surveys of 101 neonates and infants who had died from sudden infant death syndrome were reviewed. The average age at the time of death was 2. 6 months (range, 2 weeks- 8 months 2 weeks). The location, distribution, and thickness of <b>subperiosteal</b> new bone formation of the long bones were noted and measured with an ocular magnification system. RESULTS: <b>subperiosteal</b> new bone formation was identified in 35 infants (35 %), all of whom were between 1 and 4 months of age. The prevalence of <b>subperiosteal</b> new bone formation involving one or more bones was 37 % for ages 1 - 2 months, 55 % for ages 2 - 3 months, and 35 % for ages 3 - 4 months. <b>subperiosteal</b> new bone formation involved the tibia in 29 infants (bilateral involvement in 19) and the femurs in 14 infants (bilateral involvement in 11). The humerus was a site of <b>subperiosteal</b> new bone formation in 12 infants; the ulna, in seven infants; and the radius, in two infants. The thickness of the <b>subperiosteal</b> new bone formation was never more than 1. 8 mm, and the average thickness for the various long bones ranged from 0. 7 to 0. 9 mm. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that <b>subperiosteal</b> new bone formation is a common finding in infants 1 - 4 months of age. It is potentially an abnormal finding in neonates (CI = 0. 0, 0. 007) and in infants older than 4 months of age (CI = 0. 0, 0. 003). A thickness of 2 mm or more in <b>subperiosteal</b> new bone formation is likely to be abnormal and should prompt further diagnostic evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Subperiosteal</b> {{implants}} used to {{be prescribed}} to partially and fully edentulous patients to restore occlusion and esthetics prior {{to the emergence of}} the more successful endosseous implants that are used today. Because <b>subperiosteal</b> implants had a high incidence of failure, difficulty of placement, and post-operative complications, the use of <b>subperiosteal</b> implants declined significantly. However, some subperiostal implants placed 20 - 30 years ago still survive. Little information is available in the literature on how to treat patients whose <b>subperiosteal</b> implants still remain. This clinical case report thereby describes a treatment for a patient with a maxillary <b>subperiosteal</b> implant placed 23 years ago. The patient was offered a treatment option that included surgical implant removal, bone grafting and placement of endosseous implants to support a new maxillary overdenture. This treatment plan was not feasible due to the financial constraints of the patient and the complexity of the treatment. The patient chose a more conservative treatment plan, preserving the existing implant. The existing maxillary <b>subperiosteal</b> implant was restored with MICRO ERA attachments and a maxillary implant-retained overdenture was fabricated. The patient was satisfied with the esthetics and functional aspects of the treatment. No further peri-implant bone loss or other complications were found after a six-month recall. This clinical report suggests an alternative treatment plan for patients with existing <b>subperiosteal</b> implants that wish to avoid complex surgical procedures...|$|E
