40|$|Objective {{and setting}} To {{understand}} risk-taking behavior and safety practices associated with urban in-line skating, 2, 210 outdoor <b>skaters</b> {{were observed in}} Boston, Massachusetts. Methods Estimated age, sex, and use of helmets, wrist guards, and elbow and knee pads were recorded. <b>Skaters</b> were coded as beginner, average, or advanced, and skating locations were classified as street, sidewalk, or bicycle path. Results About 60 % of <b>skaters</b> wore wrist guards, but only 5. 7 % wore helmets. Male <b>skaters</b> wore less protective equipment than female <b>skaters</b> {{and were more likely}} to skate on streets. Beginner and advanced <b>skaters</b> wore more protective gear than average <b>skaters.</b> Surprisingly, street <b>skaters</b> wore less protective gear than <b>skaters</b> on sidewalks or paths. Conclusions Renewed focus on the importance of wearing helmets is needed. Given the higher injury risks for male <b>skaters,</b> clinicians and public health experts need to target male <b>skaters</b> in prevention efforts. In addition, average and advanced <b>skaters</b> need to be convinced that although they have improved their skills, it is still important to wear protective gear...|$|R

5|$|German luger Georg Hackl is {{the overall}} medal {{leader in the}} sport, having {{collected}} {{a total of five}} medals (three golds and two silvers) in the men's singles, during the six Winter Games in which he competed (1988–2006). Following his victory at the 1992 Winter Olympics, Hackl was the first male luger to successfully defend an Olympic title, in 1994. By repeating this feat in Nagano 1998, he joined two other men (Swedish figure <b>skater</b> Gillis Grafström and German skier Ulrich Wehling) and two women (Norwegian figure <b>skater</b> Sonja Henie and American speed <b>skater</b> Bonnie Blair) who had won the same individual event in three consecutive Olympic Games. Hackl was also the first-ever Olympian to win at least one medal in five consecutive Olympics. This effort was matched by Armin Zöggeler of Italy, who won his fifth straight Olympic medal (bronze) in the men's singles at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In 2002, Zöggeler outperformed Hackl and prevented him from reaching a unique fourth successive gold medal. Four years later, in Turin, Zöggeler became the second male luger to win back-to-back titles. Ten-time World Cup champion Markus Prock of Austria never fulfilled his success at Olympic level: in 1992 and 1994, Prock beat Georg Hackl to the World Cup title, but ended up losing the Olympic gold medal to the German.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} bone mineral density (BMD) of {{competitive}} female teenage figure <b>skaters</b> {{with a history}} of fracture with the BMD of <b>skaters</b> without fracture and to compare each group to age-matched, nonathletic controls. DESIGN: Retrospective age-matched cohort. SETTING: Tertiary care medical center and 3 local skating clubs. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six adolescent female competitive <b>skaters</b> (10 with fracture, 26 without fracture) to 22 age-matched controls. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BMD was estimated by quantitative ultrasound. RESULTS: <b>Skaters</b> who had suffered stress fractures had BMD values comparable with those of healthy nonathletic controls. However, <b>skaters</b> who had not suffered stress fractures had calcaneal BMD values 15 % to 24 % greater than either the controls or <b>skaters</b> with fractures. Among the <b>skaters</b> without fracture, there was a 14 % to 19 % higher calcaneal BMD in <b>skaters</b> who executed triple jumps relative to <b>skaters</b> who performed only double jumps. Furthermore, there was 7 % to 11 % greater BMD in the landing foot of the <b>skaters</b> relative to the takeoff foot. CONCLUSIONS: Stress fractures in adolescent <b>skaters</b> are not caused by low bone mass but may result from excessive forces placed on a normal skeleton.
