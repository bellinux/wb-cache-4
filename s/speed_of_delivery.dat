25|$|Well {{known as}} a printer and publisher, Franklin was {{appointed}} postmaster of Philadelphia in 1737, holding the office until 1753, when he and publisher William Hunter were named deputy postmasters–general of British North America, the first to hold the office. (Joint appointments were standard at the time, for political reasons.) Franklin {{was responsible for the}} British colonies as far as the island of Newfoundland, opening Canada's first post office at Halifax, Nova Scotia, while Hunter became postal administrator in Williamsburg, Virginia and oversaw areas south of Annapolis, Maryland. Franklin reorganized the service's accounting system, then improved <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> between Philadelphia, New York and Boston.

The internal flow of carbon nanotubes shows a better result of biological function than water channels. Thus, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for calculation <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> water <b>delivery</b> in nanotubes considering the capillary properties of Single-walled, Zigzag, chiral and Armchair carbon nanotubes arrangements, using discharge calculation (Q). It was found that the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> water <b>delivery</b> in nanotubes is in the order of armchairs, chiral and finally zigzags. In other words, it is to argue that the adhesion between water molecules and the inner wall of Armchair nanotubes is stronger, and its capillary property functions faster than other arrangements...|$|R

Under advice from team-mates, he switched late in 1955 to bowling off-cutters [...] off-breaks with a pronounced undercut delivered at almost medium pace. The move was an instant success. In 1956, Shepherd took 177 wickets, {{more than any other}} player in that English first-class season, and he took more than 100 wickets in 12 seasons in all. On bad wickets, he could be devastating; on good wickets, his accuracy and the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> meant that he was usually economical.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} great bowlers to employ the pitched {{delivery}} to good effect was Edward [...] "Lumpy" [...] Stevens of Chertsey and Surrey. [...] There is a surviving rhyme about him {{to the effect that}} [...] "honest Lumpy did allow he ne'er would pitch but o'er a brow". [...] In those days, the leading bowler on each side had choice of precisely where the wickets would be placed and Lumpy was adept at finding a spot where the turf was uneven on a good length so that he could use his repertoire of shooters, twisters and risers. [...] Lumpy was a true professional who studied the arts and crafts of the game to seek continuous improvement as a bowler. [...] He is known to have observed the flight of the ball and experimented for long hours with variations of line, length and <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> until he had mastered the art of pitching.|$|E
2500|$|The Sorcerer also {{contained}} several musical techniques {{that would become}} typical in the operas. [...] One {{of the most important}} ones is the comic baritone's lightly orchestrated, rapid-fire patter song, which would {{become one of the most}} distinguishing and popular features of Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] Following Italian opera precedents, such as [...] "Largo al factotum" [...] from The Barber of Seville, these numbers juxtapose virtuosity in their <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> (requiring clarity of elocution) with their often comic or satiric lyrics. [...] In [...] "My name is John Wellington Wells", the title character of The Sorcerer introduces himself as a tradesman of an ironic kind: [...] "a dealer in magic and spells". [...] Another typical Sullivanian musical technique is the contrapuntal combination of slow and rapid tunes in one song and a tenor aria set in 6/8 time. [...] Sullivan did this so frequently in the Savoy operas that comedian Anna Russell, in her comedy routine [...] "How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera", exclaimed, [...] "the tenor...according to tradition, must sing an aria in 6/8 time". [...] Another repeated musical technique was the emphasis of a single syllable to distinguish otherwise identical lines. [...] For example, in the vicar's Act I song, the same melody is sung in each of the two stanzas using the following text: ...|$|E

60|$|Once {{this process}} of {{segregation}} from the high road of the horse and pedestrian sets in, it will probably go on rapidly. It may spread out from short omnibus routes, much as the London Metropolitan Railway system has spread. The motor carrier companies, competing in <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> with the quickened railways, will conceivably co-operate with the long-distance omnibus and the hired carriage companies {{in the formation of}} trunk lines. Almost insensibly, certain highly profitable longer routes will be joined up--the London to Brighton, for example, in England. And the quiet English citizen will, no doubt, while these things are still quite exceptional and experimental in his lagging land, read one day with surprise in the violently illustrated popular magazines of 1910, that there are now so many thousand miles of these roads already established in America and Germany and elsewhere. And thereupon, after some patriotic meditations, he may pull himself together.|$|E
