25|$|During negotiations, anger {{disrupts}} {{the process by}} reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention and changing their central goal from reaching agreement to retaliating against the other side. Angry negotiators pay less attention to opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains. Moreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their preferences, it {{increases the likelihood that}} they will reject profitable offers. Opponents who get really angry (or cry, or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors: make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in your favor.|$|E
25|$|One topic {{covered in}} this section {{describes}} the responsibility art therapist have to their patients (ATCB 2005). According to the ATCB, art therapists must strive to advance the wellness of their clients, respect {{the rights of the}} client, and make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> providing a useful service (2005). They cannot discriminate against patient whatsoever, and may never desert or neglect patients receiving therapy. Art therapist must fully explain to their patients what their expectations of the patients will be {{at the outset of the}} professional relationship between the two. Art therapists should continue therapy with a patient only if the client is benefiting from the therapy. It's against the principles established by the ATCB for art therapist to have patients only for financial reasons.|$|E

25|$|Financial {{institutions}} {{must now}} undertake steps {{to identify the}} owners of any privately owned bank outside the U.S. who have a correspondent account with them, along {{with the interests of}} each of the owners in the bank. It is expected that additional scrutiny will be applied by the U.S. institution to such banks to make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not engaging in money laundering. Banks must identify all the nominal and beneficial owners of any private bank account opened and maintained in the U.S. by non-U.S. citizens. There is also an expectation that they must undertake enhanced scrutiny of the account if it is owned by, or is being maintained on behalf of, any senior political figure where there is reasonable suspicion of corruption.|$|E

2500|$|United States – U.S. President Obama and aides {{for former}} Senator Domenici {{publicly}} supported continued {{development of new}} U.S. nuclear power facilities. The influential The New York Times stated in an editorial on 14 March that [...] "the unfolding Japanese tragedy also should prompt Americans to closely study our own plans for coping with natural disasters and with potential nuclear plant accidents to make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> indeed, strong enough". A more definitive expression {{of the impact of}} the accidents in the United States was the decision by NRG Energy, Inc. to abandon already started construction on two new nuclear power plants in Texas. Analysts attributed the abandonment of the project to the financial situation of the plant-partner TEPCO, the inability raise other construction financing, the current low cost of electricity in Texas, and expected additional permitting delays.|$|E
2500|$|Typical weekly {{maintenance}} includes changing around 10–20% {{of the water}} while cleaning the gravel, or other substrate if the aquarium has one; however some manage to avoid this entirely by keeping it somewhat self-sufficient. A good habit is to remove the water being replaced by [...] "vacuuming" [...] the gravel with suitable implements, as this will eliminate uneaten foods and other residues that settle on the substrate. In many areas tap water is {{not considered to be}} safe for fish to live in because it contains chemicals that harm the fish. Tap water from those areas must be treated with a suitable water conditioner, such as a product which removes chlorine and chloramine and neutralizes any heavy metals present. The water conditions must be checked both in the tank and in the replacement water, to make <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> suitable for the species of fish kept.|$|E

2500|$|This Christian {{influence}} {{was evident in}} much of their magical praxes. For instance, the historian Owen Davies believed that the written charms supplied by cunning folk displayed the [...] "intrinsic Christian content of [...] magic" [...] {{and the influence of}} mystical and magical words taken from the Bible. Historian Ronald Hutton concurred with this assessment, remarking that [...] "Looking at the recorded charms dispensed by magical practitioners, it is obvious that many – perhaps the majority – are Christian in character. They quote from the Bible, or appeal to the Trinity, or to Jesus, or to saints. In most cases, to be <b>sure,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> using the trappings and symbols of Christianity with little regard to what the churchmen would have regarded as its essence; the Bible... This is, however, a large part of what popular Christianity had always been about, and something that had caused learned and devout members of the faith to tear their hair at intervals ever since the time of the Church Fathers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Representatives from Telenor and Teleplan {{testified that}} Kristiansen's phone {{could not have}} been in the {{vicinity}} {{at the time of the}} murders. This gave Kristiansen an alibi since he was using the phone several times. Telenor found six other cell sites covering the area of the crime, but Kristiansen's phone was not connected to any of these. Instead, Kristiansen's phone was exclusively connected to a cell site called [...] "EG_A", a cell site Telenor was unable to make contact with even with the other cell sites disconnected.

Furthermore, since cell phones always connect to the strongest cell site, and cell phones rescan quite frequently to be <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> continuously connected to the strongest cell site, it was clear, even if [...] "EG_A" [...] against all odds had coverage at that particular time, that Kristiansen {{could not have been}} near the crime site.|$|E
2500|$|Cameron's {{march from}} Wanganui, with about 2000 troops, mainly the 57th Regiment, began on 24 January and came under {{daylight}} attack {{that day and}} the next from Hauhau forces led by Patohe while camped on an open plain at Nukumaru, suffering more than 50 casualties and killing about 23 Māori. The Hauhau warriors {{were part of a}} contingent of 2000 based at Weraroa pā, near Waitotara, who were determined to halt Cameron's march northward. Pai-Mārire chief prophet Te Ua Haumēne was also at the pā, but took no part in the fighting. Cameron's force, by then boosted to 2300, moved again on 2 February, crossing the Waitotara River by raft and establishing posts at Waitotara, Patea and several other places before arriving at the Waingongoro River, between Hawera and Manaia, on 31 March, where a large camp and redoubts were built. Troops encountered fire at Hawera, but his only other major encounter was at Te Ngaio, in open country between Patea and Kakaramea, on 15 March when the troops were ambushed by about 200 Māori, including unarmed women. Cameron claimed 80 Māori losses, the heaviest loss of Hauhau tribes in the West Coast campaign. His force suffered one killed and three wounded in the Te Ngaio attack, which was the last military attempt by Māori to halt Cameron's northward advance. Cameron's own troops were also losing enthusiasm for the campaign, with one 18th-century writer reporting sympathetic Irish soldiers in the 57th Regiment saying, [...] "Begorra, it's a murder to shoot them. <b>Sure,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> our own people, with their potatoes and fish, and children." ...|$|E
