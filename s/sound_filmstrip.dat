50|$|From {{the late}} 1970s to the {{beginning}} of 1980, because most filmstrip publishers stopped making their <b>sound</b> <b>filmstrip</b> sets with LP records, audiovisual companies started producing automatic filmstrip projectors with built-in cassette players to better meet the audiovisual needs of teachers and school librarians. In 1979-1980 the DuKane Corporation in St. Charles, Illinois began to produce a cassette automatic filmstrip projector called the DuKane Micromatic II. This automatic filmstrip projector was easier to use by loading the filmstrip in the projector backward when the plastic upper film spring was flipped back. Loading the cassettes into the projector's cassette compartment was also easier with a control panel for the filmstrip and accompanying cassette. This filmstrip projector also had 50 Hz synchronization and could also be operated by remote control when set on manual mode. It was very popular with classroom and music teachers and school librarians. DuKane also produced their new line of silent filmstrip projectors which were also popular in schools.|$|E

40|$|It was {{the purpose}} of this study to {{investigate}} the use of a <b>sound</b> <b>filmstrip</b> and accompanying discussion as a teaching method to promote creative thinking in gifted junior high students. Two major groups were used for the experiment. The Control Group did not see the <b>sound</b> <b>filmstrip</b> and was merely given the essay assignment, the measuring instrument of creative thinking. The Experimental Group was shown the sound filmstrip- "Values For Teenagers: The Choice Is Yours," followed by a short discussion on some relevant questions, and then was given the task of writing an essay on "Freedom of Choice. " Each group contained 20 students; an equal number of gifted and nongifted students and also an equal distribution by sex in each level of giftedness. A Pilot Study was run using an average, regular 8 th grade English class. The three judges used these essays to determine the criterion of creativity; then they applied the criterion to the Control and Experimental group essays and gave each one a creativity score, A three-way factorial analysis of variance was used on the groups to determine whether there were significant differences between them. Significance was set at the. 05 level. This study showed that the audio-visual method employed to stimulate creative thinking in gifted junior high students was inadequate in facilitating such creative thinking in the sample group. The Control Group scored as well in creative thinking as the Experimental Group which was purposefully stimulated toward a creative product. It also pointed out that nongifted students have as great a potential, if not greater, for creative thinking as gifted students. Although female students, especially in the Control Group, scored somewhat higher than males there does not seem to be a real sexual difference in creativity scores. Males and females have similar creative potential. Creativity remains difficult to measure and perhaps future research will refine creativity measurement to the point that concrete knowledge may be gained by studies such as this one. Such a discovery will be a great contribution to mankind...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop {{instructional}} material on Guglielmo Marconi's reception of the first transatlantic wireless signals for use as supplementary material for the Grade Five Newfoundland history text.

A review of existing materials both print and non-print, confirmed that this was the case. [...] A survey of thirty-five teachers of history in Grade Five was conducted.
