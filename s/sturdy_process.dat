40|$|Several {{publications}} {{in the literature}} are stating that welding of AlSi coated boron steelwithout any pre-treatment often results in reduced weld strength and generally make the jointmore brittle. These problems are normally solved by locally removing the AlSi coating in aseparated process step before welding. One of the main goals of the experiments here presented was to join tailor weldedblanks (TWB) using only one process step without locally removing the AlSi coating and stillachieve the required weld strength needed for subsequent forming operations and good crashperformance. Laser-hybrid welding, a mixture of laser and MAG welding, were used for welding ofTWB’sThe experiments showed that correctly used, laser-hybrid can achieve welds in Usibor 1500 P materials that reach 95 % {{of the strength of}} welds made on uncoated 22 MnB 5 materials, in one process step without locally removing the AlSi coating. Optimized laser-hybrid welds were also tested on full scale B-pillars where theyperformed as good as conventionally laser-welded B-pillars (with coating removal) and nonweldedB-pillars. All welds were intact after both static and crash testing. In all, the experiments has successfully gathered knowledge on the determining factorsfor a <b>sturdy</b> <b>process</b> with high weld quality, approved crash performance, and improvedproductivity.

40|$|We {{have used}} an {{antiserum}} to L-glutamic acid decarboxylase ((GAD), a synthesizing enzyme for y-aminobutyric acid (GABA)) to localize putative GABAergic neurons {{in the developing}} C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse retina. At early developmental stages (embryonic day 17 to postnatal day 3), strong GAD-like immunoreactivity is detectable in cell bodies located within the neuroblastic layer. These cells have relatively large cell bodies and extend several <b>sturdy</b> <b>processes</b> which are oriented radially at these early stages. We have identified these cells as horizontal cells. In addition, cell bodies adjacent to the inner plexiform layer and both diffuse and punctate structures within the inner plexiform layer proper have weak GAD-like immunoreactivity at this time. By postnatal day 6, GAD-positive horizontal cell processes begin to form a horizontal network in the newly formed outer plexiform layer. Immunolabeling of amacrine cell bodies and of punctate structures in the inner plexiform layer becomes much stronger at this time, reaching a maximum staining intensity during the second postnatal week. After postnatal day 12, GAD-like immunoreactivity of the horizontal cells begins to decline; in 4 -weekold mice the horizontal cells are no longer detectably labeled by this GAD antiserum. At the same time, the GAD-like-immunoreactive material in the inner plexiform layer becomes stratified, forming distinct layers. Amacrine cells and the inner plexiform layer remain GAD positive into adulthood...|$|R
40|$|Known {{learning}} {{rules for}} the Perceptron are in some sense incomplete since no one ensures to detect non linear separability, to achieve linear separability when it is possible and to yield an optimal generalization error. We present in this paper KLR, a new learning rule for the Perceptron derived from the Kullback Distance. Our approach consists in introducing a stochastic perturbation which allows us to approximate an error function by a convex one. Hence, the minimization of this function is safe from local minima. We moreover prove that KLR asymptotically learns all linearly separable sets of patterns, and that it detects the non linearly separable ones. Simulations confirm these theoretical results. They also show that KLR provides a generalization error {{very close to the}} optimal. KLR moreover yields a <b>sturdy</b> learning <b>process.</b> Fine tuning of parameters is not needed to obtain good results. We also show {{that it is possible to}} use KLR in order to test architecture inadequacy of clas [...] ...|$|R
