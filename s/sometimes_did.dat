5|$|GameSpot {{gave the}} game an 8 out of 10, praising the game's characters, art, voice acting and {{challenging}} gameplay. However, {{they noted that}} at times that spoken dialogue <b>sometimes</b> <b>did</b> not match the displayed text dialogue. A reviewer of PC Gamer scored the game 69 out of 100, noting that Space Run attempts to reverse the typical tower defense concept, but ultimately relies on memorizing missions rather than clever design. The reviewer considered {{the best part of}} the game to be the time bonus, which is necessary to earn full reputation.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few years the {{situation}} deteriorated further. Governor Tryon and the Boys exchanged threats, truce offers, and other writings, which were frequently written by Allen in florid and didactic language, while the Boys continued to drive surveyors and incoming tenants on New York-granted lands away. Most of these incidents did not involve bloodshed, although individuals were at times manhandled, and the Boys <b>sometimes</b> <b>did</b> extensive property damage when driving tenants out. By March 1774, the harsh treatment of settlers and their property by Allen and the Boys prompted Tryon to increase some of the rewards to £100.|$|E
5|$|The Plebeian Council elected two 'Plebeian Magistrates', the Plebeian Tribunes and the Plebeian Aediles. Usually the Plebeian Tribune {{presided over}} the assembly, {{although}} the Plebeian Aedile <b>sometimes</b> <b>did</b> as well. Originally, statutes passed by the Plebeian Council ("Plebiscites") only applied to Plebeians. However, in 449 BC, a statute of an Assembly was passed which gave Plebiscites {{the full force of}} law over all Romans (Plebeians and Patricians). It was not until 287 BC, however, that the last mechanism which allowed the Roman Senate to veto acts of the Plebeian Council was revoked. After this point, almost all domestic legislation came out of the Plebeian Council.|$|E

5|$|In Han government, {{the emperor}} was the supreme judge and lawgiver, the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the armed}} forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations; those who earned a 600-bushel salary-rank or higher. Theoretically, there were no limits to his power. However, state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference (tingyi 廷議)—where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issue—pressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions. If the emperor rejected a court conference decision, he risked alienating his high ministers. Nevertheless, emperors <b>sometimes</b> <b>did</b> reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences.|$|E
5|$|Some of the privatised industries, {{including}} gas, water, and electricity, were natural monopolies {{for which}} privatisation involved little increase in competition. The privatised industries that demonstrated improvement <b>sometimes</b> <b>did</b> so while still under state ownership. British Steel Corporation had made great gains in profitability while still a nationalised industry under the government-appointed MacGregor chairmanship, which faced down trade-union opposition to close plants and halve the workforce. Regulation was also significantly expanded {{to compensate for}} the loss of direct government control, with the foundation of regulatory bodies such as Oftel (1984), Ofgas (1986), and the National Rivers Authority (1989). There was no clear pattern to the degree of competition, regulation, and performance among the privatised industries; in most cases privatisation benefited consumers in terms of lower prices and improved efficiency, but the results overall are said to have been mixed.|$|E
5|$|After a time, Himmler {{found that}} the killing methods used by the Einsatzgruppen were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>did</b> not kill the victims quickly enough. Many of the troops found the massacres to be {{difficult}} if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered {{physical and mental health}} problems, and many turned to drink. As much as possible, the Einsatzgruppen leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt. Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part. A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of Einsatzgruppe D, SS-Gruppenführer Otto Ohlendorf, particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.|$|E

5|$|Once it was {{determined}} that the mountain was the highest point in the region, the succession of the authorities that held control over it took an interest in its name and changed it periodically for symbolic reasons. In 1896, as part of Austria-Hungary, the highest peak of the Carpathians received its first government-sponsored name − after the contemporary head of state Emperor Francis Joseph I. Guidebooks <b>sometimes</b> <b>did</b> not catch up on these name changes. After the dissolution of the monarchy in 1918, the mountain continued to be known simply as Gerlachovský štít because it belonged to the village of Gerlachov. The Polish government, claiming the territory of the High Tatras for Poland, simultaneously called the mountain Szczyt Polski (Polish Peak), but never gained control over it. The new Czechoslovak government changed the name to Štít legionárov (Legionnaires Peak) in honor of the Czechoslovak Legions in 1923, but the name was dropped in favor of the earlier Gerlachovský štít in 1932. As a result of the Communist coup d'état in 1948, the mountain was renamed once more − to Stalinov štít (Stalin Peak) in 1949. Its traditional name Gerlachovský štít was restored yet again a decade later and has remained unchanged through the present.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} roughly in two parts. The first deals with whether {{know-how}} is constituted by propositional knowledge, as discussed primarily by Gilbert Ryle (1949) The concept of mind. London: Hutchinson, Jason Stanley and Timothy Williamson (2001). Knowing how. Journal of Philosophy, 98, pp. 411 - 444 {{as well as}} Stephen Hetherington (2006). How to know that knowledge-that is knowledge-how. In S. Hetherington (Ed.) Epistemology futures. Oxford: Oxford University Press. The conclusion of this first part is that know-how <b>sometimes</b> <b>does</b> and <b>sometimes</b> <b>does</b> not consist in propositional knowledge. The second part defends an analysis of know-how inspired by Katherine Hawley 2 ̆ 7 (2003). Success and knowledge-how. American Philosophical Quarterly, 40, pp. 19 - 31, insightful proposal that know-how requires counterfactual success. I conclude by showing how this analysis helps to explain why know-how <b>sometimes</b> <b>does</b> and <b>sometimes</b> <b>does</b> not consist of propositional knowledge...|$|R
25|$|After being {{released}} from the concentration camp, Bolz moved back to Beuron, near Ulm. There, he forswore politics for a while, busying himself mainly with economic issues, papal social encyclicals, and Catholic Action. During this time of involuntary retirement, he <b>sometimes</b> <b>did</b> work as a tax advisor, and he always knew that the Gestapo were watching him.|$|E
25|$|Human {{dissection}} {{was also}} practised by Renaissance artists. Though most chose {{to focus on}} the external surfaces of the body, some like Michelangelo Buonarotti, Antonio del Pollaiolo, Baccio Bandinelli, and Leonardo da Vinci sought a deeper understanding. However, there were no provisions for artists to obtain cadavers, so they had to resort to unauthorised means, as indeed anatomists <b>sometimes</b> <b>did,</b> such as grave robbing, body snatching, and murder.|$|E

He turned the oars into serpents, so terrifying the sailors that they jumped overboard, but Dionysus took pity on them and transformed them into dolphins {{so that they would}} spend their lives providing help for those in need. Dolphins were also the messengers of Poseidon and <b>sometimes</b> <b>did</b> errands for him as well. Dolphins were sacred to both Aphrodite and Apollo.|$|E

25|$|During {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} upon his {{exit from the}} treatment center in 1955, Lugosi stated {{that he was about}} to go to work on a new Ed Wood film, The Ghoul Goes West. This was one of several projects proposed by Wood, including The Phantom Ghoul and Dr. Acula. With Lugosi in his famed Dracula cape, Wood shot impromptu test footage, with no storyline in mind, in front of Tor Johnson's home, a suburban graveyard and in front of Lugosi's apartment building on Carlton Way. This footage ended up in Plan 9 from Outer Space, which was mostly filmed after Lugosi's death. Wood hired Tom Mason, his wife's chiropractor, to double for Lugosi in additional shots. Mason was noticeably taller and thinner than Lugosi, and had the lower half of his face covered with his cape in every shot, as Lugosi <b>sometimes</b> <b>did</b> in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein.|$|E
500|$|The {{exhibition}} established Brooks' {{reputation as}} an artist. Reviews were effusive, and the poet Robert de Montesquiou wrote an appreciation calling her [...] "the thief of souls." [...] The restrained, almost monochromatic decor of her home also attracted attention; she was often asked to give advice on interior design, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>did,</b> though she did not relish the role of decorator. Brooks became increasingly disillusioned with Parisian high society, finding the conversation dull, and feeling that people were whispering about her. [...] Despite her artistic success, she described herself as a lapidéliterally, a victim of stoning.|$|E
500|$|In 1839, Eckfeldt {{retired after}} 25 years as chief coiner and over forty as a Mint employee. His fellow {{officers}} at the Mint presented him with a gold medal, with silver and bronze duplicates also struck.

[...] Eckfeldt recommended Peale as his successor, and Peale was appointed. Nevertheless, Eckfeldt continued to perform the functions of chief coiner without pay until {{a few days before}} his death on February 6, 1852. After Eckfeldt's death, Peale, wrote what Taxay terms a [...] "frantic letter" [...] to Mint Director George N. Eckert, seeking the appointment of an assistant. Peale had spent the freed-up time designing and selling medals for private gain.|$|E

500|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{opened a}} bookstore {{known as the}} Christian Arts Center, which carried books {{from a variety of}} spiritual backgrounds. They also {{launched}} a venture known as Know Place to teach classes on mysticism and theosophy. They closed these businesses a short time later. In February 1973, they resolved to travel to teach others about their beliefs and drove throughout the Southwest and Western U.S; Lifton describes their travels as a [...] "restless, intense, often confused, peripatetic spiritual journey". While traveling, they had little money and occasionally resorted to selling their blood or working odd jobs for much-needed funds. They subsisted solely on bread rolls at times, often camped out, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>did</b> not pay their lodging bills. One of their friends from Houston corresponded with them and agreed to accept their teachings. They visited her in May 1974, and she became their first convert.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Although {{this movie}} is {{effective}} moment to moment, very little of it lingers in the mind afterward.

[...] Scott Mendelson of Forbes said, [...] "Avengers: Age of Ultron plays like an obligation, a box to be checked off on a list before all parties move onto the things they really want to do." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, [...] "This Avengers doesn't always pop the way that the first one <b>sometimes</b> <b>did,</b> partly because its villain isn't as memorable, despite Mr. Spader's silky threat." [...] Camilla Long of The Sunday Times remarked, [...] "Two hours of boredom and boobs add up to a sorry basis for the new Avengers." [...] Much like the release of Guardians of the Galaxy, the film received mixed reviews upon release in China, due to poor translations. The translations, which were said to be too literal, were thought [...] "to have been done by Google Translate." ...|$|E
