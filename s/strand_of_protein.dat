An {{intriguing}} family of regulatory RNAs includes transcripts {{from the opposite}} <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> coding genes, so called natural antisense transcripts (NATs). Here, we test the hypothesis that antisense transcription triggers RNA interference and gives rise to endogenous short RNAs (endo-siRNAs). Results: We used cloned human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) followed by short RNAseq to investigate the small genic RNA transcriptome. 378 genes gave rise to short RNA reads that mapped to exons of RefSeq genes. The length profile of short RNAs showed a broad peak of 20 - 24 nucleotides, indicative of endo-siRNAs. Collapsed reads mapped predominantly to {{the first and the}} last exon of genes (74...|$|E

In bacteria, some of these antisense RNAs are transcriptional noise while others play a vital role to adapt the cell to changing environmental conditions. By deep sequencing analysis of transcriptome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, a partial RNA sequence encoded in-cis to the dnaA gene was revealed. Northern blot and RACE analysis confirmed the transcription of this antisense RNA which was expressed mostly in the stationary phase of the bacterial growth and also under iron limitation and osmotic stress. Pulse expression analysis showed that overexpression of the antisense RNA resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} mRNA levels of dnaA, which will ultimately enhance their translation. Our findings have revealed that antisense RNA of dnaA is indeed transcribed not merely as a by-product of the cell's transcription machinery but plays a vital role as far as stability of dnaA mRNA is concerned...|$|E

The positions of the mutated amino acids are in 38 and 145, respectively among which P→L substitution might be crucial as the amino acid situated in {{the outside of the}} envelope in a beta-strand (Tang et al. 2007).

40|$|An {{unexpectedly}} {{high number}} of regulatory RNAs have been recently discovered that fine-tune the function of genes {{at all levels of}} expression. We employed Genomic SELEX, a method to identify protein-binding RNAs encoded in the genome, to search for further regulatory RNAs in Escherichia coli. We used the global regulator protein Hfq as bait, because it can interact with a large number of RNAs, promoting their interaction. The enriched SELEX pool was subjected to deep sequencing, and 8865 sequences were mapped to the E. coli genome. These short sequences represent genomic Hfq-aptamers and are part of potential regulatory elements within RNA molecules. The motif 5 &# 39;-AAYAAYAA- 3 &# 39; was enriched in the selected RNAs and confers low-nanomolar affinity to Hfq. The motif was confirmed to bind Hfq by DMS footprinting. The Hfq aptamers are 4 -fold more frequent on the antisense <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> coding genes than on the sense strand. They were enriched opposite to translation start sites or opposite to intervening sequences between ORFs in operons. These results expand the repertoire of Hfq targets and also suggest that Hfq might regulate the expression {{of a large number of}} genes via interaction with cis-antisense RNAs...|$|E
40|$|Organisms of the crenarchaeal order Sulfolobales carry complex CRISPR (clustered {{regularly}} interspaced short palindromic repeats) adaptive immune systems. These {{systems are}} modular and show extensive structural and functional diversity, especially in their interference complexes. The primary targets are an exceptional range of diverse viruses, {{many of which}} propagate stably within cells and follow lytic life cycles without producing cell lysis. These properties {{are consistent with the}} difficulty of activating CRISPR spacer uptake in the laboratory, but appear to conflict with the high complexity and diversity of the CRISPR immune systems that are found among the Sulfolobales. In the present article, we re-examine the first successful induction of archaeal spacer acquisition in our laboratory that occurred exclusively for the conjugative plasmid pMGB 1 in Sulfolobus solfataricus P 2 that was co-infected with the virus SMV 1 (Sulfolobus monocaudavirus 1). Although we reaffirm that protospacer selection is essentially a random process with respect to the pMGB 1 genome, we identified single spacer sequences specific for each of CRISPR loci C, D and E that, exceptionally, occurred in many sequenced clones. Moreover, the same sequence was reproducibly acquired for a given locus in independent experiments, consistent with it being the first protospacer to be selected. There was also a small protospacer bias (1. 6 : 1) to the antisense <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> genes. In addition, new experiments demonstrated that spacer acquisition in the previously inactive CRISPR locus A could be induced on freeze– thawing of the infected cells, suggesting that environmental stress can facilitate activation.

The solution structure of HSPC 280 was determined using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The overall structure consists of three a-helices and four antiparallel b-strands and has a winged helix-like fold. However, HEPC 280 is not a typical DNA-binding winged helix protein in that it lacks DNA-binding activity.

A number of protective mechanisms have evolved in the edge <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> �-sheets, preventing the aggregation and insolubility of most natural �-sheet proteins.

The gene for the B 1 IgG-binding domain from Group G Streptococcus (StrpG) has been fused {{to the end of}} the gene III protein from bacteriophage M 13. The resulting fusion protein is displayed on the surface of the bacteriophage giving the phage the ability to bind to IgG molecules. Phage displaying the wild type B 1 domain exhibit a small plaque phenotype that can be reversed when destabilizing mutations are introduced into the protein. By selecting phage that recover a normal plaque morphology coupled with IgG binding function, it is possible to identify mutants that are folded but destabilized compared to native Strp G. These mutants can be divided into three general categories: (1) those that disrupt packing of the hydrophobic core, (2) those that destabilize secondary structure, and (3) those that alter specific stabilizing interactions between side chains. The mutants exhibit folding stabilities that are decreased from 2 – 5 kcal/mol compared to native Strp G. ^ The NMR structure ofa deletion mutant identified by this selection is described.

The effects of casein structure on coagulation properties were also studied. The sample preparation for transmission electron microscopy involved physical methods of fixation and flash freeing to preserve the structure of caseins in the sample. The structure of caseins in sodium and calcium caseinate varied with sodium caseinate not exhibiting any spherical structure as opposed to the spherical structure seen in calcium caseinate, non-fat dried milk and native milk. This difference in structure was carried over to rennet coagulum made from those sources of casein. Addition of calcium and phosphate to sodium and calcium caseinate, respectively, improved their coagulation properties. Hydration parameters such as time and shear of hydration affected the extent of hydration. High shear (733 s- 1) or approximately 10 hr of hydration was required to disperse and hydrate the dried milk protein powders.

One of the critical steps in computational derivation <b>of</b> a <b>protein</b> structure is to reduce the huge number of topologies of the secondary structures, such as helices and <b>strands,</b> <b>of</b> a <b>protein</b> chain. In this paper, we study a particular question emerged from experimental data that carry the geometrical relationship of the secondary structures. We explored the question if the native topology is likely to be identified among a large set of all possible topologies. The secondary structure topology in this paper refers to the order and the directionality of the secondary structures. For a given protein sequence N helices and M β-strands, the number of possible secondary structure topology is (N! 2 N) (M! 2 M), a huge number to compute even when N and M are small numbers. We have developed a computational method and its parallel code to generate all the possible topologies and to evaluate the energy of each topology. By mutating residue side chains of the secondary structures, connection orders are switched and a new topology is created. The large number of permutations is partitioned and distributed to different CPUs. We compared the speedup between two approaches of distributing the work: the even distribution and the dynamic distribution.

Also the degree of complementarity between the two <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> the intermediate RNA duplex defines how the miRNA are sorted into different types <b>of</b> Argonaute <b>proteins.</b>|$|R
40|$|Tight-junctions between {{epithelial}} cells of biological barriers are specialized molecular structures that regulate the flux of solutes across the barrier, parallel to cell walls. The tight-junction backbone is made <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> transmembrane <b>proteins</b> from the claudin family, but the molecular mechanism of its function {{is still not}} completely understood. Recently, the crystal structure of a mammalian claudin- 15 was reported, displaying {{for the first time}} the detailed features of transmembrane and extracellular domains. Successively, a structural model of claudin- 15 -based paracellular channels has been proposed, suggesting a putative assembly that illustrates how claudins associate in the same cell (via cis interactions) and across adjacent cells (via trans interactions). Although very promising, the model offers only a static conformation, with residues missing in the most important extracellular regions and potential steric clashes. Here we present detailed atomic models of paracellular single and double pore architectures, obtained from the putative assembly and refined via structural modeling and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in double membrane bilayer and water environment. Our results show an overall stable configuration of the complex with a fluctuating pore size. Extracellular residue loops in trans interaction are able to form stable contacts and regulate the size of the pore, which displays a stationary radius of 2. 5 - 3. 0 Å at the narrowest region. The side-by-side interactions of the cis configuration are preserved via stable hydrogen bonds, already predicted by cysteine crosslinking experiments. Overall, this work introduces an improved version of the claudin- 15 -based paracellular channel model that strengthens its validity and that can be used in further computational studies to understand the structural features of tight-junctions regulation...|$|R
