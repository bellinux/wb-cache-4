50|$|Unlike histograms, <b>stem-and-leaf</b> <b>displays</b> {{retain the}} {{original}} data {{to at least}} two significant digits, and put the data in order, thereby easing the move to order-based inference and non-parametric statistics.|$|R
40|$|<b>Stem-and-leaf</b> <b>displays</b> {{have been}} widely taught since John W. Tukey publicized them energetically in the 1970 s. They remain useful for many {{distributions}} of small or modest size, especially for showing fine structure such as digit preference. Stata’s implementation stem produces typed text displays and has some inevitable limitations, especially for comparison {{of two or more}} displays. One can re-create <b>stem-and-leaf</b> <b>displays</b> with a few basic Stata commands as scatterplots of stem variable versus position on line with leaves shown as marker labels. Comparison of displays then becomes easy and natural using scatter, by(). Back-to-back presentation of paired displays is also possible. I discuss vari- ants on standard <b>stem-and-leaf</b> <b>displays</b> in which each distinct value is a stem, each distinct value is its own leaf, or axes are swapped. The problem shows how one can, with a few lines of Stata, often produce standard graph forms from first principles, allowing in turn new variants. I also present a new program, stemplot, as a convenience tool. stemplot, stem-and-leaf, graphics, distributions, digit preference...|$|R
50|$|The {{ease with}} which histograms can now be {{generated}} on computers has meant that <b>stem-and-leaf</b> <b>displays</b> are less used today than in the 1980s, when they first became widely utilized as a quick method of displaying information graphically by hand.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>stem-and-leaf</b> <b>display</b> {{is often}} called a stemplot, but the latter term often refers to another chart type. [...] A simple stem plot may refer to {{plotting}} a matrix of y values onto a common x axis, and identifying the common x value with a vertical line, and the individual y values with symbols on the line.|$|E
50|$|The <b>stem-and-leaf</b> <b>display</b> {{is drawn}} with two columns {{separated}} by a vertical line. The stems are listed {{to the left of}} the vertical line. It is important that each stem is listed only once and that no numbers are skipped, even if it means that some stems have no leaves. The leaves are listed in increasing order in a row to the right of each stem.|$|E
50|$|Univariate {{analysis}} involves {{describing the}} distribution of a single variable, including its central tendency (including the mean, median, and mode) and dispersion (including the range and quartiles of the data-set, and measures of spread such as the variance and standard deviation). The shape of the distribution may also be described via indices such as skewness and kurtosis.Characteristics of a variable's distribution may also be depicted in graphical or tabular format, including histograms and <b>stem-and-leaf</b> <b>display.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{picture is}} worth a {{thousand}} words. This paper shows how to use pictures called <b>stem-and-leaf</b> diagrams to <b>display</b> important loss patterns that might otherwise remain hidden in development triangles. These diagrams have {{the added benefit of}} appealing to the “big picture ” folks in your audience. So that important patterns are always observed in these diagrams, this paper also presents some good practice suggestions that are used to review and evaluate another type of diagram, electrocardiograms (ECG) tracings...|$|R
50|$|A <b>stem-and-leaf</b> <b>display</b> is {{a device}} for {{presenting}} quantitative {{data in a}} graphical format, similar to a histogram, to assist in visualizing {{the shape of a}} distribution. They evolved from Arthur Bowley's work in the early 1900s, and are useful tools in exploratory data analysis. Stemplots became more commonly used in the 1980s after the publication of John Tukey's book on exploratory data analysis in 1977. The popularity during those years is attributable to their use of monospaced (typewriter) typestyles that allowed computer technology of the time to easily produce the graphics. Modern computers' superior graphic capabilities have meant these techniques are less often used.|$|E
50|$|Stem-and-leaf {{displays}} {{are useful}} for displaying the relative density {{and shape of the}} data, giving the reader a quick overview of distribution. They retain (most of) the raw numerical data, often with perfect integrity. They are also useful for highlighting outliers and finding the mode. However, stem-and-leaf displays are only useful for moderately sized data sets (around 15-150 data points). With very small data sets a stem-and-leaf displays can be of little use, as a reasonable number of data points are required to establish definitive distribution properties. A dot plot may be better suited for such data. With very large data sets, a <b>stem-and-leaf</b> <b>display</b> will become very cluttered, since each data point must be represented numerically. A box plot or histogram may become more appropriate as the data size increases.|$|E
40|$|The <b>stem-and-leaf</b> <b>display</b> is {{a natural}} semi-graphic {{technique}} to include in statistical computing systems. This paper discusses the choices involved in implementing both automated and flexible versions of the display, develops an algorithm for the automated version, examines various implementation considerations, and presents a set of semi-portable FORTRAN subroutines for producing stem-and-leaf displays. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{description}} {{of a system of}} subroutines to compute solutions to the iteratively reweighted least squares problem is presented. The weights are determined from the data and linear fit and are computed as functions of the scaled residuals. Iteratively reweighted least squares is a part of robust statistics where "robustness" means relative insensitivity to moderate departures from assumptions. The software for iteratively reweighted least squares is cast as semi-portable Fortran code whose performance is unaffected (in the sense that performance will not be degraded) by the computer or operating-system environment in which it is used. An [ell sub 1] start and an [ell sub 2] start are provided. Eight weight functions, a numerical rank determination, convergence criterion, and a <b>stem-and-leaf</b> <b>display</b> are included. ...|$|E
40|$|Imaging genetic {{research}} has essentially focused on discovering unique and co-association effects, but typically ignoring to identify outliers or atypical objects in genetic {{as well as}} non-genetics variables. Identifying significant outliers is an essential and challenging issue for imaging genetics and multiple sources data analysis. Therefore, we need to examine for transcription errors of identified outliers. First, we address the influence function (IF) of kernel mean element, kernel covariance operator, kernel cross-covariance operator, kernel canonical correlation analysis (kernel CCA) and multiple kernel CCA. Second, we propose an IF of multiple kernel CCA, which can be applied {{for more than two}} datasets. Third, we propose a visualization method to detect influential observations of multiple sources of data based on the IF of kernel CCA and multiple kernel CCA. Finally, the proposed methods are capable of analyzing outliers of subjects usually found in biomedical applications, in which the number of dimension is large. To examine the outliers, we use the <b>stem-and-leaf</b> <b>display.</b> Experiments on both synthesized and imaging genetics data (e. g., SNP, fMRI, and DNA methylation) demonstrate that the proposed visualization can be applied effectively.

40|$|Health care {{planning}} requires {{characterization of the}} population to be served. Examination of available demographic and epidemiologic data is one early step in this process. However, aggregate data for the entire geographic area of concern often fail to reveal important differences among geographically defined sub-populations [...] differences that influence the form an effective delivery system should take. We present a methodology based on exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques that we have found useful in examining health-related data for our ambulatory care catchment area. Our examples use three population characteristics that have major implications for health {{care planning}} for the elderly: 1970 - 1980 change in population aged 65 +; the {{percent of the population}} aged 65 + below poverty level; and the percent of single-person households among households with one or more persons aged 65 +. With these data for the 25 municipalities of Middlesex County, New Jersey, we illustrate a two-step process: (1) the construction of stem-and-leaf displays that permit examination of a data distribution for asymmetry, concentrations around specific values, gaps in values, and outliers; and (2) the use of the median, the fourth-spread, and other information from the <b>stem-and-leaf</b> <b>display</b> in the systematic selection of data value classes to be given distinct shadings on a map of the selected geographic area. Discussion emphasizes the usefulness of graphic display of data in detecting similarities and unusual data values. Comparison of maps based on the EDA techniques and maps based on several traditional methods of value classing for the same data illustrates the influence of classing choices on the interpretation of cartographic displays of health-related data. health care planning human geography small-area variation resistant statistics cartography...|$|E
