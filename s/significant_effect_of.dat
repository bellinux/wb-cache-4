25|$|The {{reason for}} the <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the two 28cm rounds on Blücher was that the first round {{penetrated}} {{the side of the}} ship and exploded inside a magazine containing cans of oil, smoke dispensers, incendiary bombs, aircraft bombs for the cruiser's Arado Ar 196 reconnaissance floatplanes and depth charges. The bulkheads on that deck were blown out and the burning oil developed into an intense fire. The second 28cm shell also knocked out the electricity central for the ship's main guns, rendering them unable to return fire.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research were to investigate the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> emotional honesty, interpersonal skills, task structure and directive behaviour on leadership effectiveness. This research was conducted at Vocational Schools (Sekolah Menengah Kejuruan: SMK) in Medan in 2010 by using survey with 132 principals as population and the sample of 60 principals as respondents who were selected by applying proportional random sampling technique. The hypotheses were tested by using path analysis. This research findings were as follows: (1) There was a direct <b>significant</b> positive <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> emotional honesty on interpersonal skills; (2) There was a direct <b>significant</b> positive <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> emotional honesty on task structure; (3) There was a direct <b>significant</b> positive <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> emotional honesty on directive behaviour; (4) There was a direct <b>significant</b> positive <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> interpersonal skills on directive behaviour; (5) There was a direct <b>significant</b> positive <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> task structure on directive behaviour; (6) There was a direct <b>significant</b> positive <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> interpersonal skills leadership effectiveness; (7) There was a direct <b>significant</b> positive <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> directive behaviour on leadership effectiveness...|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} {{treatment}} units (subjects {{or groups of}} subjects) assigned to control and treatment groups, affects an RCT's reliability. If {{the effect of the}} treatment is small, the number of treatment units in either group may be insufficient for rejecting the null hypothesis in the respective statistical test. The failure to reject the null hypothesis would imply that the treatment shows no statistically significant effect on the treated in a given test.

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the yellow fever on Memphis was in {{demographic}} changes. Nearly all of Memphis's upper and middle classes vanished, depriving {{the city of}} its general leadership and class structure that dictated everyday life similar to other large Southern cities such as New Orleans, Charleston, and Atlanta. In Memphis, the poorer whites and blacks fundamentally made up the city and played the greatest role in reestablishing the city. The epidemic had resulted in Memphis being a less cosmopolitan place, with an economy that serviced the cotton trade and a population drawn increasingly from poor white and black Southerners.|$|E
25|$|Notium, {{although}} not terribly {{significant in the}} number of ships won or lost by either side (the gains made by the Spartan fleet were more than erased by their defeat at Arginusae), had the <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> launching the career of Lysander and ending that of Alcibiades. Lysander would go on to end the Athenian empire and contend for several years for control of the Spartan empire that replaced it; Alcibiades, meanwhile, would be assassinated in 403 BC, having never returned to his native city. Donald Kagan, meanwhile, has suggested that the most important effect of the battle on the Athenian side was the removal from command of Thrasybulus, the talented commander who had helped plan all the Athenian naval victories of 411 and 410 BC.|$|E

25|$|Blöndal and Scarpetta (1999) find <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> socio-demographic {{factors on}} the {{retirement}} decision. Men tend to retire later than women as women try {{to benefit from}} special early retirement schemes in Germany and the Netherlands. Another reason is that they get access to pensions earlier than men as standard age of entitlement to pension is lower for women compared with men in Italy and the United Kingdom. The other interesting finding is that retirement depends on household size: heads of large households prefer not to retire. They think {{that this can be}} because of the significance of wages in large households compared with smaller ones and insufficiency of pension benefits. Another finding is that health status is significant factor in all early retirements; poor health conditions are especially significant if respondents join to disability benefit scheme. This result is true for both indicators used to express health status (self assessment and objective indicators). This research is similar to Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) and shows similar results extending sample and implications from Germany to OECD.|$|E
25|$|In November 1958, {{with the}} sudden {{cessation}} of French aid and personnel for Guinea, Nkrumah and Touré met in Conakry, {{the capital of}} Guinea, to discuss an emergency loan which Ghana was going to provide to Guinea. On 23 November, the two leaders announced {{a plan for the}} creation of a union of African states which the two leaders would work towards over a series of meetings with the loan as the first of many steps towards integration. Following these negotiations, the Union of Independent African States (UIAS) was declared on 1 May 1959. The agreement was very loose, only requiring that the members work together on relations with other African countries and thus was, in the words of journalist Russel Warren Howe, more pragmatic than ambitious. They declared intentions for developing a shared currency (a union bank and union economic council were planned) and shared citizenship, but did not include unified defense or foreign policy provisions in regards to countries outside of Africa. Despite these declarations, little happened to cement any shared currency or create unified citizenship between the two countries in 1958 or 1959. The only <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the union was the £10 million (about £ today) loan provided by Ghana to Guinea. However, even this relationship was hesitantly agreed to by the members. Guinea used less than half of the funds provided by Ghana despite its continued economic problems.|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of Geoffrey's Historia and its other derivative works (such as Wace's Roman de Brut) is generally {{agreed to be}} an important factor in explaining the appearance of significant numbers of new Arthurian works in continental Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, particularly in France. It was not, however, the only Arthurian influence on the developing [...] "Matter of Britain". There is clear evidence that Arthur and Arthurian tales were familiar on the Continent before Geoffrey's work became widely known (see for example, the Modena Archivolt), and [...] "Celtic" [...] names and stories not found in Geoffrey's Historia appear in the Arthurian romances. From the perspective of Arthur, perhaps the most <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> this great outpouring of new Arthurian story was {{on the role of the}} king himself: much of this 12th-century and later Arthurian literature centres less on Arthur himself than on characters such as Lancelot and Guinevere, Percival, Galahad, Gawain, Ywain, and Tristan and Iseult. Whereas Arthur is very much at the centre of the pre-Galfridian material and Geoffrey's Historia itself, in the romances he is rapidly sidelined. His character also alters significantly. In both the earliest materials and Geoffrey he is a great and ferocious warrior, who laughs as he personally slaughters witches and giants and takes a leading role in all military campaigns, whereas in the continental romances he becomes the roi fainéant, the [...] "do-nothing king", whose [...] "inactivity and acquiescence constituted a central flaw in his otherwise ideal society". Arthur's role in these works is frequently that of a wise, dignified, even-tempered, somewhat bland, and occasionally feeble monarch. So, he simply turns pale and silent when he learns of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere in the Mort Artu, whilst in Chrétien de Troyes's Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, he is unable to stay awake after a feast and has to retire for a nap. Nonetheless, as Norris J. Lacy has observed, whatever his faults and frailties may be in these Arthurian romances, [...] "his prestige is never—or almost never—compromised by his personal weaknesses... his authority and glory remain intact." ...|$|E

2500|$|Online {{profiles}} {{and communication}} channels such as email provide fewer cues than in-person interactions, which makes targets {{more difficult to}} understand. [...] When research {{participants were asked to}} evaluate a person's facial attractiveness and perceived ambition based on an online dating profile, amount of time permitted for processing and reporting an evaluation of the target produced a difference in impression formation. Spontaneous evaluations relied on physical attractiveness almost exclusively, whereas deliberate evaluations weighed both types of information. Although deliberate evaluations used the information provided on both physical attractiveness and ambition of each target, the particular impact of each kind of information appeared to depend on the consistency between the two. A <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> attractiveness on deliberate evaluations was found only when perceived ambition was consistent with the perceived level of attractiveness. The consistency found in profiles seemed to particularly influence deliberate evaluations.|$|E
2500|$|The Crow Terrace Poetry Trial (or Crow Terrace Poetry Case, 烏臺詩案) was a {{trial on}} charges {{including}} treason, or, lèse majesté (Sung Criminal Code, Article 122: [...] "Denouncing the Imperial Chariot") {{that occurred in}} the year 1079 (during the Song dynasty) era of China (960–1279). [...] "Crow Terrace" [...] refers to the imperial Office of the Censorate (御史臺), which prosecuted the case, a nickname. The most prominent figure of the numerous accused parties was the official and artist Su Shi (1037 – 1101), whose works of poetry were produced in court as evidence against him. Of the several tens or dozens accused, the most prominent figure was the remarkable artist and political leader Su Shi, whose works of poetry were produced as {{a key part of the}} evidence against him. The Crow Terrace Poetry Trial was a major landmark in the struggle for free speech, in medieval China; and, as the outcome of the judicial proceedings resulted in Su Shi's conviction and sentence to exile, as well as the conviction and sentencing to various punishments of over 30 other individuals (some or many of whom were let off with fines and reprimands), the Crow Terrace Poetry Trial had the <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> dampening subsequent creative expression and set a major negative precedent for freedom of speech, at least for the remainder of Song Dynasty China. Besides the significance of the Crow Terrace Poetry Trial for Su Shi and poetry, it is also a rather remarkably well-documented instance of a medieval Chinese literary prosecution, with surviving copies of indictments, arguments, case disposition; not to mention numerous of Su Shi's poems, which were entered as evidence.|$|E
