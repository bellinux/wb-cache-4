60|$|It {{cannot be}} doubted, I think, that Mr. Darwin has satisfactorily proved {{that what he}} terms {{selection}}, or <b>selective</b> <b>modification,</b> must occur, and does occur, in nature; and he has also proved to superfluity that such selection is competent to produce forms as distinct, structurally, as some genera even are. If the animated world presented us with none but structural differences, I should have no hesitation in saying that Mr. Darwin had demonstrated {{the existence of a}} true physical cause, amply competent to account for the origin of living species, and of man among the rest.|$|E
60|$|For, you see, if {{you have}} not done that you have not {{strictly}} fulfilled all the conditions of the problem; you have not shown that you can produce, by the cause assumed, all the phenomena which you have in nature. Here are the phenomena of Hybridism staring you in the face, and you cannot say, 'I can, by <b>selective</b> <b>modification,</b> produce these same results.' Now, it is admitted on all hands that, at present, so far as experiments have gone, it has not been found possible to produce this complete physiological divergence by selective breeding. I stated this very clearly before, and I now refer to the point, because, if it could be proved, not only that this 'has' not been done, but that it 'cannot' be done; if it could be demonstrated {{that it is impossible to}} breed selectively, from any stock, a form which shall not breed with another, produced from the same stock; and if we were shown that this must be the necessary and inevitable results of all experiments, I hold that Mr. Darwin's hypothesis would be utterly shattered.|$|E
60|$|Here is a feature, then, great {{or small}} {{as it may}} be, which distinguishes natural species of animals. Can we find any {{approximation}} to this in the different races known to be produced by selective breeding from a common stock? Up to the present time {{the answer to that}} question is absolutely a negative one. As far as we know at present, there is nothing approximating to this check. In crossing the breeds between the Fantail and the Pouter, the Carrier and the Tumbler, or any other variety or race you may name--so far as we know at present--there is no difficulty in breeding together the mongrels. Take the Carrier and the Fantail, for instance, and let them represent the Horse and the Ass in the case of distinct species; then you have, as the result of their breeding, the Carrier-Fantail mongrel,--we will say the male and female mongrel,--and, as far as we know, these two when crossed would not be less fertile than the original cross, or than Carrier with Carrier. Here, you see, is a physiological contrast between the races produced by <b>selective</b> <b>modification</b> and natural species. I shall inquire into the value of this fact, and of some modifying circumstances by and by; for the present I merely put it broadly before you.|$|E

2500|$|However, the Futurists {{were not}} truly abolishing syntax. White {{points out that}} since [...] "The OED defines 'syntax' as 'the {{arrangement}} of words in their proper forms) by which their connection and relation in a sentence are shown". The Futurists were not destroying syntax in that sense. Marinetti in truth advocated a number of [...] "substantial, but nevertheless <b>selective</b> <b>modifications</b> to existing syntax" [...] and that the [...] "Russian Futurists' idea that they were 'shaking syntax loose'" [...] is more accurate.|$|R

60|$|There is, in fact, one set {{of these}} peculiarities which the theory of <b>selective</b> <b>modification,</b> as it stands at present, is not wholly {{competent}} to explain, {{and that is the}} group of phenomena which I mentioned to you under the name of Hybridism, and which I explained to consist in the sterility of the offspring of certain species when crossed one with another. It matters not one whit whether this sterility is universal, or whether it exists only in a single case. Every hypothesis is bound to explain, or, at any rate, not be inconsistent with, the whole of the facts which it professes to account for; {{and if there is a}} single one of these facts which can be shown to be inconsistent with (I do not merely mean inexplicable by, but contrary to) the hypothesis, the hypothesis falls to the ground,--it is worth nothing. One fact with which it is positively inconsistent is worth as much, and as powerful in negativing the hypothesis, as five hundred. If I am right in thus defining the obligations of an hypothesis, Mr. Darwin, in order to place his views beyond the reach of all possible assault, ought to be able to demonstrate the possibility of developing from a particular stock by selective breeding, two forms, which should either be unable to cross one with another, or whose cross-bred offspring should be infertile with one another.|$|E

40|$|A {{panel of}} lipases was {{screened}} for the selective acetylation and alcoholysis of silychristin and silychristin peracetate, respectively. Acetylation at primary alcoholic group (C- 22) of silychristin {{was accomplished by}} lipase PS (Pseudomonas cepacia) immobilized on diatomite using vinyl acetate as an acetyl donor, whereas selective deacetylation of 22 -O-acetyl silychristin was accomplished by Novozym 435 in methyl tert-butyl ether/ n-butanol. Both of these reactions occurred without diastereomeric discrimination of silychristin A and B.

The structure of hemicalyculin A, which comprises the southern hemisphere of calyculin A, was firmly established by chemical methods. Six compounds were prepared by <b>selective</b> <b>modifications</b> of functional groups in calyculin A. The enzyme inhibitory activity of these compounds indicated that 17 -phosphate, 13 -hydroxyl, and the hydrophobic tetraene moieties were all necessary for binding to the enzymes.

40|$|Biological {{membranes}} {{define the}} boundaries of the cellular compartments in higher eukaryotes and are active in many processes such as signal transduction and vesicular transport. Although post-translational lipid modification of numerous proteins in signal transduction is crucial for biological function(1), analysis of protein-protein interactions has mainly focused on recombinant proteins in solution under defined in vitro conditions. Here we present a new strategy for the synthesis of such lipid-modified proteins. It involves the bacterial expression of a carboxy-terminally truncated non-lipidated protein, the chemical synthesis of differently lipidated peptides representing the C terminus of the proteins, and their covalent coupling. Our technique is demonstrated using Ras constructs, which exhibit properties very similar to fully processed Ras, but can be produced in high yields and are open for <b>selective</b> <b>modifications.</b> These constructs are operative in biophysical and cellular assay systems, showing specific recognition of effecters by Ras lipoproteins inserted into the membrane surface of biosensors and transforming activity of oncogenic variants aft er microinjection into cultured cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea that}} {{modifications}} of affect, behavior and cognition produced by psychotherapy are mediated by biological underpinnings predates {{the advent of}} the modern neurosciences. Recently, several studies demonstrated that psychotherapy outcomes are linked to modifications in specific brain regions. This opened the debate over the similarities and dissimilarities between psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. In this study, we used activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis to investigate the effects of psychotherapy (PsyTh) and pharmacotherapy (DrugTh) on brain functioning in Major Depression (MD). Our results demonstrate that the two therapies modify different neural circuits. Specifically, PsyTh induces <b>selective</b> <b>modifications</b> in the left inferior and superior frontal gyri, middle temporal gyrus, lingual gyrus and middle cingulate cortex, {{as well as in the}} right middle frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus.

40|$|Heparan sulfate (HS) is ubiquitously {{expressed}} on mammalian cells. It is a polysaccharide {{that binds}} growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, and thereby controls several important physiological functions. Ironically, many human pathogens including viruses interact {{with it for}} adherence to host cells. HS functions can be regulated by <b>selective</b> <b>modifications</b> and/or <b>selective</b> cleavage of the sugar chains from the cell surface. In mammals, heparanase (HPSE) is the only known enzyme capable of regulating HS functions via a selective endoglycosidase activity that cleaves polymeric HS chains at internal sites. During homeostasis, HPSE expression and its endoglycosidase activity are tightly regulated; however, under stress conditions, including infection, its expression may be upregulated, which could contribute directly to the onset of several disease pathologies. Here we focus on viral infections exemplified by herpes simplex virus, dengue virus, human papillomavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, hepatitis C virus, and porcine respiratory and reproductive syncytial virus to summarize recent advances in understanding the highly significant, but emerging roles, of the enzyme HPSE in viral infection, spread and pathogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Synaptic plasticity, {{the ability}} of synapses to change in strength, {{requires}} alterations in synaptic molecule compositions over time, and synapses undergo <b>selective</b> <b>modifications</b> on stimulation. Molecular motors operate in sorting/transport of neuronal proteins; however, the targeting mechanisms that guide and direct cargo delivery remain elusive. We addressed the impact of synaptic transmission on the regulation of intracellular microtubule (MT) -based transport. We show that increased neuronal activity, as induced through GlyR activity blockade, facilitates tubulin polyglutamylation, a posttranslational modification thought to represent a molecular traffic sign for transport. Also, GlyR activity blockade alters the binding of the MT-associated protein MAP 2 to MTs. By using the kinesin (KIF 5) and the postsynaptic protein gephyrin as models, we show that such changes of MT tracks are accompanied by reduced motor protein mobility and cargo delivery into neurites. Notably, the observed neurite targeting deficits are prevented on functional depletion or gene expression knockdown of neuronal polyglutamylase. Our data suggest a previously undescribed concept of synaptic transmission regulating MT-dependent cargo delivery...|$|R
40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{develops}} {{through a}} multistage process {{that results from}} the progressive accumulation of genetic mutations, and frequently {{as a result of}} mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway.

Epigenetic regulation is organized at multiple levels, involving primarily DNA methylation and <b>selective</b> histone <b>modifications</b> in cancer cells. Assessment of the CRC epigenome has revealed that virtually all CRCs have aberrantly methylated genes and that the average CRC methylome has thousands of abnormally methylated genes.
