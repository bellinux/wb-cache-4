2500|$|Anticipating the {{obstruction}} {{of the water}} flow {{from north to south}} by the growing garbage mounds, the government directed the civic body to transfer [...] to the forest department. After this, the state government will acquire patches of land in the northern (adjacent to Velachery–Tambaram road) and southeastern parts of the marshland, measuring about , to protect the ecosystem in its totality from becoming an open dumpyard.

[...] Historically, the camp area was visited regularly by the Esselen American Indians, whose food sources included acorns gathered from the Black Oak, Canyon Live Oak and Tanbark Oak {{in the vicinity of}} the camp. The camp has been repeatedly threatened by fire, including the Marble Cone Fire of 1977, the Basin Complex fire in 2008, and the 2016 Soberanes Fire, [...] which were successfully kept at bay by fire fighters. The three fires burned entirely around the camp. [...] In 2008 and in 2016 the camp was evacuated as a precautionary measure due to the fires.|$|E

Further research must be performed regarding de-extinction to investigate advantages and disadvantages to the technology. New technological practices must be examined to prevent environmental hazards.|$|R
