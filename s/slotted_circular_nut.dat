It is reported that full pitched segmented switched reluctance machine (SSRM) can give 40 % higher torque than conventional SRM for the same frame size.

40|$|Abstract A design {{method to}} achieve {{multiple}} band-rejection characteristics in a wideband <b>circular</b> <b>slot</b> antenna is presented. First, a wideband <b>circular</b> <b>slot</b> antenna fed by a coplanar waveguide {{is designed to}} operate in the frequency range between 2. 3 and 11 GHz, which covers WLAN, WiBro, WiMAX, and UWB frequency bands. Next, resonant frequency variations of rejection bands are examined with respect to different slot locations and lengths when slots are inserted on the ground conductor and the circular patch of the antenna. When arc-shaped slots are placed close to the circular transition from a feeding part, multiple notch bands are obtained. In this case, a half of the guided wavelength of the first notch band corresponds to the slot length and other notch bands are integer-multiple of the first band. Single notch band can be obtained when the slot is located off the transition part. Based on this study, a wideband <b>circular</b> <b>slot</b> antenna with five band-rejection frequency bands at 2. 45, 3. 5, 4. 9, 7. 35, and 9. 8 GHz is designed and fabricated.

Altec engineer Clifford A. Henricksen reported on the differences between radial and [...] "circumferential" [...] types of phase plugs at Audio Engineering Society conventions in 1976 and 1978. The radial design is easier to produce, but it does not differentiate between sound waves from the perimeter of the diaphragm and sound waves from the center. At high frequencies, the diaphragm does not act as a perfect piston; instead, it displays rippling, modal properties related to its stiffness and density. Because of the speed of wave propagation through the diaphragm material, the center of the diaphragm moves slightly later than the perimeter.

The feasible UWB antenna design face some challenges including the ultra wide impedance matching, omni directional radiation pattern, constant gain, high radiation efficiency, low profile, compact antenna size and easy manufacturing. since the CPW fed planar slot antennas have the advantages of wide bandwidth, simple structure, less radiation loss, low cost and easy integration of monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC).
