The Dataspeed 40 interfaced a <b>synchronous</b> <b>modem</b> usually running at 2400, 4800 or 9600 baud. The trademarked term [...] "Dataspeed" [...] originated with a series of high speed paper tape terminals that sent and received oil-treated punched paper tape at 1050 words per minute. AT&T used the Dataspeed 40 terminals internally for their Switching Control Center System and similar purposes. The Dataspeed 40 was also sold commercially and used for a variety of purposes and displaced some older and slower speed Teletype equipment.|$|E

(Modern systems typically use a start bit to announce the beginning of a transmitted word - [...] this is a feature of asynchronous communication.

50|$|The USART's {{synchronous}} capabilities {{were primarily}} intended to support synchronous protocols like IBM's Synchronous transmit-receive (STR), Binary Synchronous Communications (BSC), Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC), and the ISO-standard High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) synchronous link-layer protocols, which were used with <b>synchronous</b> voice-frequency <b>modems.</b> These protocols {{were designed to}} make the best use of bandwidth when modems were analog devices. In those times, the fastest asynchronous voice-band modem could achieve at most speeds of 300 bit/s using frequency-shift keying modulation, while <b>synchronous</b> <b>modems</b> could run at speeds up to 9600 bit/s using phase-shift keying. Synchronous transmission used only slightly over 80% of the bandwidth of the now more-familiar asynchronous transmission, since start and stop bits were unnecessary. Those modems are obsolete, having been replaced by modems which convert asynchronous data to synchronous forms, but similar synchronous telecommunications protocols survive in numerous block-oriented technologies such as the widely used IEEE 802.2 (Ethernet) link-level protocol. USARTs are still sometimes integrated with MCUs. USARTs are still used in routers that connect to external CSU/DSU devices, and they often use either Cisco's proprietary HDLC implementation or the IETF standard Point-to-Point Protocol in HDLC-like framing as defined in RFC 1662.|$|R
50|$|Through {{most of the}} 1980s {{the entire}} traffic between the European {{backbone}} and the United States BITNET backbone was carried over a single 4.8kbit/s circuit and afterward, for quite some time, over a single 9.6kbit/s circuit using a pair of IBM <b>synchronous</b> <b>modems.</b> Later in the late 1980s the backbone bandwidth was gradually augmented to accommodate for the increased traffic but given the very high prices for dedicated telephone circuits {{at the time it}} became soon clear EARN could no longer afford a dedicated European backbone. Since the IBM sponsorship of international and transatlantic lines had stopped in fact each European country member of EARN, typically the organization in charge of each national academic network, was paying its own line to connect to the European backbone and was sharing the cost of the transatlantic connectivity via the EARN annual contribution.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{reports the}} theory and {{implementation}} of a decentralized navigation system that enables simultaneous single-beacon navigation of multiple underwater vehicles. In single-beacon navigation, each vehicle uses ranges from a single, moving reference beacon {{in addition to its}} own inertial navigation sensors to perform absolute localization and navigation. In this implementation the vehicles perform simultaneous communication and navigation using underwater acoustic modems, encoding and decoding data within the acoustic broadcast. Vehicles calculate range from the time of flight of asynchronous acoustic broadcasts from the reference beacon. Synchronous clocks on the reference beacon and the vehicles enable the measurement of one-way travel-times, whereby the time of launch of the acoustic signal at the reference beacon is encoded in the acoustic broadcast and the time of arrival of the broadcast is measured by each vehicle. The decentralized navigation algorithm, running independently on each vehicle, is implemented using the information form of the extended Kalman filter and has been previously shown to yield results that are identical to a centralized Kalman filter at the instant of each range measurement. We summarize herein the architecture and design of the acoustic communications (Acomms) system consisting of an underwater acoustic <b>modem,</b> <b>synchronous</b> clock, and the software necessary to run them, and salient results from the validation of the decentralized information filter using a simulated data set.

40|$|The {{interest}} in a compressed representation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) is twofold: economy of the storage space needed to hold large libraries of cardiograms in machine readable form, and reduction of the data rate required for the digital transmission of cardiograms via the telephone network. Compression of the digitized cardiogram without loss in precision {{can be achieved by}} removing the redundant information included in consecutive signal samples. It is proposed to remove the redundancy arising from the non-uniform distribution of the quantized signal amplitudes by the well-known Huffman encoding procedure. For the removal of redundancy due to statistical dependence of consecutive signal samples, a decorrelation scheme implemented by prediction of a sample value from a linear combination of past samples is proposed. The evaluation of the techniques in terms of signal to quantization noise ratios showed that the resulting overall data compression could be increased by lowering of the sampling rate. Unlike redundancy removal, the decrease of the sample rate, and thus, reduction of the signal bandwidth does compromise the diagnostic information of the cardiogram. Therefore, for the purpose of assessing the signal degradation due to the limitation of bandwidth, its effect on a set of 16 clinically useful ECG measurements were studied in a random sample of 220 male patients. The measurement differences for paired identical beats from the original and the filtered cardiograms were computed and evaluated in terms of each patient's own beat-to-beat measurement variation. The percentage of records with measurements differing from the original by more than 2 standard deviations of the measurement distribution assessed from the original record were 0. 5, 5. 5, 14. 5, and 53. 6 % for half-amplitude bandwidths of 100, 80, 60, and 40 Hz respectively. The measurements most sensitive to bandwidth limitations were RY amplitude, followed by QRS spatial vector maximum, RX, and QZ amplitudes, whereas time durations were the least affected. With the choice of a half-amplitude bandwidth of 100 Hz, the means of the paired differences for the amplitudes were less than 10 μV. With that choice, a sampling rate of 200 Hz could be selected, resulting in a data rate for the transmission of 3 vector leads of 1, 800 bits/sec, which could be accommodated by a 2, 400 bits/sec <b>synchronous</b> data <b>MODEM</b> in connection with standard telephone lines. Compared to the digitizing of the original ECG into 8 -bit samples at a rate of 500 Hz, an average data compression ratio of 6. 7 to 1 could be expected...|$|R
