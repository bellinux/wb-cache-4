Shortly after the debut of <b>Sesame</b> <b>Street</b> in the United States in 1969, television producers, teachers, and officials of several countries approached the show's producers and the executives of Sesame Workshop (2000-present) about the possibility of airing international versions of <b>Sesame</b> <b>Street.</b> Creator Joan Ganz Cooney hired former CBS executive Michael Dann to field offers to produce versions of the show in other countries.|$|E

5|$|<b>Sesame</b> <b>Street</b> {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown <b>Sesame</b> <b>Street</b> clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the <b>Sesame</b> <b>Street</b> material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at <b>Sesame</b> <b>Street</b> materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E

5|$|The {{show has}} {{undergone}} significant changes throughout its history. The format of <b>Sesame</b> <b>Street</b> {{consists of a}} combination of commercial television production elements and techniques which have evolved to reflect the changes in American culture and the audience's viewing habits.

It was also the first time a show's educational effects were formally studied.|$|E

The GCC considered creating a co-production for many years, so consultations were held among its member countries regarding how to do so. Many of the early co-productions were simple, dubbed versions with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways, but the GCC wanted to create their own original version.|$|E
