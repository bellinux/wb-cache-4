While the apsidal motion is defined overwhelmingly by the Newtonian portion of the secondary's gravity, the post-Newtonian portion, too, brings its tiny input. We explore whether this input may be of any astrophysical relevance in the next few decades. We demonstrate that the overall post-Newtonian input of the secondary's gravity can be split into two parts. One can be expressed via the orbital angular momentum of the secondary, another via its orbital radius. Despite some moderately large numerical factors showing up in the expressions for these two parts, the resulting post-Newtonian contributions from the secondary's gravity into the apsidal motion of the test particle turn out to be small enough to be neglected in the near-future measurements.

Furthermore, the thesis demonstrates the complexity of posting workers by drawing attention to the colliding interests of involved member states and parties, showing the sensitivity of the subject. This underlines the fact that the phenomenon cannot be separated from its political context and is condemned to a constant balancing of two colliding interests - the freedom to provide services and social protection of posted [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order for}} the core Fundamental Plane (cFP) to endure, small ellipticals must not survive mergers with giant ellipticals, despite the fact the small {{secondary}} galaxy can {{be as much as}} a million times more dense than the primary. However, our previous set of experiments has shown that, for purely stellar galaxies, the secondary does in fact survive mergers with primaries up to 100 times more massive. In this paper, we demonstrate the effect that a massive central black hole has on mergers of cFP galaxies. Our results indicate that the addition of a massive central singularity inside the primary galaxy provides strong enough tidal forces to destroy dense cFP companions when the secondary’s orbital decay is sufficiently elongated. The destruction of the <b>secondary</b> <b>acts</b> to preserve the original low central density profile of the primary in the giant merger remnant, which allows the remnant to remain on the cFP. On more circular orbits, though, the secondary is only disrupted {{near the end of the}} merger, and the degree to which the secondary particles disperse depends on the amount of orbital energy left in the merger. Hence, there are some mergers for which the cFP is not preserved in our experiments.

This {{publication}} is an {{output of}} the ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation ([URL] Queensland University of Technology. It is axiomatic in the international copyright arena for the law to impose criminal liability on <b>secondary</b> <b>acts</b> of copyright infringement. Such acts of infringement (which may also attract civil liability) typically entail the commercial exploitation of infringing copies of copyright material by unlicensed vendors. Take, for example, the ubiquitous street vendor in Bangkok’s hugely-popular Patpong district who, on a daily basis, hawks pirated CDs and DVDs to throngs of foreign tourists. Although street scenes such as these are fairly commonplace and representative of the livelihoods of numerous other unlicensed vendors the world over, the law clearly frowns upon such practices and, for some time now, has imposed penal sanctions on these secondary infringers of copyright. 1 The use of the criminal law under such circumstances {{to aid in the}} effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is understandable, because the sale of each unauthorised copy of music, film or software will, correspondingly, deprive the relevant copyright owner of the economic benefits of a legitimate transaction. Yet the fact remains that many of these so-called copyright pirates have continued to operate under the present legal environment simply because of high consumer demand; there is, after all, a sizeable global market for illegitimate products of intellectual property. The irony, of course, is this: that whilst it is a criminal offence to trade in illegitimate copies of copyright material, it is – at least under copyright law – not a crime nor an actionable civil wrong to purchase or acquire such copies for private and domestic use. 2 However, in light of the rapid advancements in computer, digital and Internet technologies, consumers and other end-users have begun to take things into their own hands. Instead of purchasing illegitimate copies of copyright material from the street vendor, they now discover that it is far more efficient and cost-effective to acquire digital copies for themselves {{in the privacy of their}} own rooms from certain Internet websites or through peer-to-peer (P 2 P) file-sharing networks. They may further decide to share these digital copies with others in the Internet or P 2 P file-sharing community. In the process, however, they inadvertently expose themselves to civil action for having committed primary acts of copyright infringement, and, in Singapore at least, they may also face criminal prosecution if primary infringers like themselves are found guilty of wilful infringements of copyright. Against this backdrop, the authors will, in this paper, examine the newly introduced criminal provisions in Singapore’s copyright legislation which target primary acts of copyright infringement and will consider, in particular, the consequences of prosecuting offenders pursuant to these provisions in the context of a number of hypothetical scenarios involving acts of infringement committed on the Internet. These Internet-based scenarios are particularly relevant and timely in the present discussion in light of recent reports in the local media concerning – (1) the various measures taken by the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (and other local agencies) to encourage all companies and businesses to use legal or licensed software in the conduct of their day-to-day business; as well as (2) the recent arrest and prosecution of two individuals in Singapore for allegedly distributing unauthorised music files via an Internet chat program. 3 This paper therefore aims to offer an academic perspective of the various types of online activity which, in the authors’ view, will likely attract criminal liability under the new provisions (as well as those which ought not to) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{scholastic}} {{concept of}} 'tempus' {{not only has}} {{little or nothing to}} do with the idea of temporality in general, but is even inappropriate or inadequate when used to express the normal duration of things. Taken in its strict Aristotelian sense ('numerus motus secundum prius et posterius'), to which almost all the scholastic masters adhere, time is not directly the measure of things (i. e. of their substantial being), but of their movements (their operations). Indeed, the problem of determining an appropriate measure for the duration of the being of sublunar substances becomes the subject of a lengthy debate from the second half of the 13 th century onwards. Up to Aquinas there is an attempt to obviate the problem by affirming that time is the measure of the being of generable and corruptible substances, not 'secundum se', but 'secundum accidens', since the fact of potentially being in movement is a property of such substances. This model, however, is not very convincing, since in this way the duration of <b>secondary</b> <b>acts</b> (time as the measure of movements, and hence of operations) would thus also become the measure, albeit accidental, of the duration of the primary act (the substantial being of each substance). • So, between the end of the 13 th and the first decades of the 14 th century, two alternative models were elaborated, both taken from the field of angelology. One adduces the concept of 'aevum'; that is, it applies the measure proper to the duration of the substantial being of separate substances to the duration of the substantial being of generable and corruptible things. The other adduces the indivisible instant of 'discrete' time; that is, it also applies to the duration of sublunar substances a measure which was initially attributed only to angels (in this case, to their operations, which are indivisible and devoid of intrinsic succession). The first model can be found in, for example, Henry of Ghent, John Duns Scotus, John of Naples and John Baconthorpe; the second was initially affirmed by Dominican masters such as Hervaeus of Nédellec (Natalis) and Durandus of St Pourçain, but has its own duration up to the Disputationes Metaphysicae by Francisco Suárez. • The evolution of this debate reveals elements that are not easily reconcilable with the thesis of a close correspondence between the transformations of the concept of time on the level of material culture and those proper to a philosophical-scientific context: a) in the first place, no matter how surprising it may seem, for most scholastic masters, 'time' does not express the duration of being of sublunar entities; b) in the second place – and in this case, too, contrary to a common notion which is still widespread – the way in which scholastic masters between the 13 th and 14 th century understand the ontology of duration has little to do with the contingency or precariousness of things of this world. The Aristotelian concept of time (which itself originates in a context that postulates the eternity of the world) is substituted by many Scholastic masters with concepts borrowed from angelology that express, even more emphatically, the permanence and stability of substantial being; c) precisely this recourse to forms of duration borrowed from theology shows that, at least in philosophical discussions, the 14 th century witnessed not so much a secularization as a 'theologization' of the concepts of time and duration; d) finally, the debate itself has its own longue durée, which coincides on the whole not so much with general, or material, history as with the vicissitudes of the assimilation / rejection of Aristotelianism between the late Middle Ages and the modern era. Not by chance, such discussions continued up to Suárez (and Descartes), even leading some historians to glimpse in the scholastic concept of 'aevum' the conceptual form closest to Newton’s notion of absolute time...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between physician and patients in medical treatment creates legal {{relationship between}} them. The agreement between physician and patients in therapeutic transaction is giving appropriate treatment toward the patient curement. This therapeutic treatment {{could be in}} the form of expanding medical treatment by practitioner toward its patients. The therapy done by physicians in increasing medical treatment is an effort to cure the patients. Yet, during the process, it may be erroneous treatment or mistakes which may impacts on legal violation. Consequently, it can be drawn that how is the physician responsibility toward the expanding medical treatment (surgery) which disadvantage patients related to regulation, and what are the legal prosecution that can be taken by patients if there are disadvantages on expanding medical treatment. This research uses nonnative jurisdiction method, where data collection techniques in the form of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>acts</b> which may then be analyzed through qualitative -descriptive method. The physician responsibility toward expanding medical treatment (surgery) which causes disadvantageous toward patients, viewed from the existing jurisdiction are: Property Acts where physician makes erroneous/mi stake and results in disadvantage toward patients then it is considered that physician has conducted law violation (oncrehtmatigedaad) which contains in chapter 1365 KUHPerdata. In this case, the physician must pay the disadvantage on patient. Criminal Law where in the operation of medical expansion, physician make mistakes which may cause death, then it can be prosecuted with chapter 359 KUHP that is five years enprisontment and entrapment for about a year, and which causes injury/lesion toward patients, then physician is prosecuted with chapter 360 with caveats physician five years enprisontment related to a year entrapment. Indonesian medical code ethics. If only physician has made mistakes/maladjustment, then the physician could be punished with administrative sanction. In medical law toward medical expansion (surgery) it may happen mistaken/maladjustment which cause disadvantage on patients then the physician obliged to get disciplinary sanction sufficient to chapter 54 and should repay related to chapter 55 Act No 23 1992 on Medical. In Permenkes'No. 585 /Men. Kes/Per/IX/ 1989 stated that if any mistaken in medical treatment expansion (surgery) then the physician should be responsible to its fault, which may be given administrative sanction such as the quittance of its practice related to chapter 13 PerMenKes/No. 585 /Men. Kes/P/IX/ 1989. Only if there is maladjustment on its medical treatment expansion (surgery) then related to Acts UURI No. 29 2004 on Medical Practices then physician should be responsible toward his faults which can be sanctioned with disciplinary sanction. In case of repayment which should be payed by physician containing in chapter 1371 KUHPerdata, where repayment should not beyond physician capacity to pay and adjusted to physician condition. The law efforts which can be done by patients are courts/litigation, where on property, patients propose a prosecution on court. The criminal law procedurs are, patients arrange prosecutions by the assistance of advocates which can be submitted to police department, then proceed to court, where legal efforts in medical acts, medical code ethics and I'erMcnKes/No. 585 /Men. Kes/Per/IX/ 1989 that is making a report to Health Department then proceeded by experts (IDI, MKEK) and if it is approved by Indonesian Medical Disciplinary Honour Committee (MKDKI) then it directs to court of justice, where as related to Indonesian Acts No 29 2004 on Medical Practices, patients could proclaim to MKDT, and if it is evidenced then directly proceeds to court based on chapter 66 on Medical Practices Acts. In taking medical expansion (surgery) which arranged in chapter 7 PerMenKes/No. 585 /Men. Kes/Per/IX/ 1989 should be based on medical profession standards (SPM), in case of death/failure toward patients then physician cannot be blamed by legal acts, yet in taking medical expansion (surgery) physicians do not obey or violate or malad just medical profession standards then he/she obliges to take the responsibility. The researcher suggest to Indonesian Medical Disciplinary Honour Committee, Medical Ethics Honour Committee, Indonesian Physicians United and Health Department improve and implement the legal acts on medical expansion treatment (surgery) and monitor the work of physician to prevent maladjustment or disadvantage on patients. ...|$|E
