40|$|Total {{respiratory}} resistance (Rrs) {{was measured}} in six anesthetized dogs with two different methods: the single-breath (SB) method, which provides the time constant of the system during a relaxed expiration and the forced oscillation (FO) method, which uses a pseudorandom noise signal applied at the airway opening. The comparison was made in three conditions: before muscle paralysis (A), after muscle paralysis (B), and after tracheal banding (C). In conditions A and B the two computed resistances correlated very well with each other (r = 0. 98). No systematic difference between Rrs values obtained with the two methods was found. In condition C the respiratory resistance was clearly nonlinear from the flow-volume curves during SB and could be described with Rohrer's equation: Rrs = K 1 X V + K 2 X V 2, where K 1 and K 2 are Kohrer's constant and V is flow. Rrs measured with FO was not frequency dependent during tracheal banding (C) and was virtually equivalent to K 1. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>FO</b> method uses low flows as the input of the respiratory system and K 1 could be ascribed to laminar flow, the numerical matching appears reasonable and tends to reinforce the validity of both methods of measurement. We conclude that, for the normal respiratory system, FO and SB methods are approximately equivalent. In {{the presence of a}} markedly alinear central airway resistance with normal lungs, the SB method appears to provide a more adequate description of the flow-resistive properties of the system. status: publishe...|$|E

A simple cost model was applied to analyze the effects of flux; recovery of <b>the</b> <b>FO</b> process; energy; and membrane cost on the FO-RO hybrid process.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> frontal operculum (<b>fO)</b> is a key node in a network for exerting control over cognitive processes. How it exerts this influence, however, has been unclear. Here, using the complementary approaches of functional MRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation, we have shown that <b>the</b> <b>fO</b> regulates increases and decreases of activity in multiple occipitotemporal cortical areas when task performance depended on directing attention to different classes of stimuli held in memory. Only one region, <b>the</b> <b>fO,</b> was significantly more active when subjects selectively attended to a single stimulus so that it determined task performance. The stimuli that guided task performance could belong to three categories [...] houses, body parts, and faces [...] associated with three occipitotemporal regions. On each trial, the pattern of functional correlation between <b>the</b> <b>fO</b> and <b>the</b> three occipitotemporal regions became either positive or negative, depending on which stimulus was to be attended and which ignored. Activation of <b>the</b> <b>fO</b> preceded both activity increases and decreases in the occipitotemporal cortex. The causal dependency of the distributed occipitotemporal pattern of activity increases and decreases on <b>the</b> <b>fO</b> was demonstrated by showing that transcranial magnetic stimulation-mediated interference of <b>the</b> <b>fO</b> diminished top-down selective attentional modulation in the occipitotemporal cortex, but it did not alter bottom-up activation of the same areas to the same stimuli when they were presented in isolation. <b>The</b> <b>fO's</b> prominence in cognitive control may stem from a role in regulating the level of activity of representations in posterior brain areas that are relevant or irrelevant, respectively, for response selection...|$|R
