40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{is to develop a}} <b>smart</b> <b>repair</b> kit to effect {{efficient}} field repair of a damaged, aircraft structure. The composite repair process consists two steps a) bonding an annular ring using ' bi-functional property of the Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) based repair. device which applies both heat and pressure and b) bonding a flush patch taking its support and novel vacuum assisted tripod stand method. This report deals with the development of <b>smart</b> <b>repair</b> kit from conceptualization to realization. Using the developed <b>smart</b> <b>repair</b> kit, many repair trials were conducted arid tested.

40|$|This is a {{preliminary}} report pertaining {{to the development of}} a shape memory alloy based <b>smart</b> <b>repair</b> device. This device is proposed to be used to bond an annular ring shaped patch in situations where it is inaccessible to repair from inside the aircraft structure, such as a wing. Once the annular ring shaped patch is bonded, then a plug can be bonded taking the support of the bonded annular ring. Hitherto,these annular rings were being bonded using conventional mechanical (screw fastener based) devices. These mechanical devices have several limitations such as uneven pressure application and cumbersome bonding procedures. In this report the development of {{a preliminary}} SMA based efficient <b>smart</b> <b>repair</b> device for a damage diameter of 75 to 80 mm is discussed...|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{properties}} of new crack repair materials using organic and inorganic composite (OAI) materials were investigated under various crack conditions. Especially, {{this study aims}} to develop new composites repair materials as needed to follow the crack and its repair method. Crack repair methods such as injection method and surface treatment repair method using self-healing capability for the practical industrial application were examined in comparison with normal crack repair method as the epoxy injection. From these results, {{it was confirmed that}} the sealing and injection effects through the cracks from field tests could be improved by OAI.

40|$|Nucleic acids are an {{emerging}} class of therapeutics {{with the capacity}} to repair both DNA and RNA mutations in clinically relevant targets. We have used two approaches, mobile group II introns and Spliceosome Mediated RNA Trans-splicing (SMaRT), to correct β-globin mutations at the DNA and RNA levels respectively. We show that the group II intron inserts site-specifically into its DNA target, even when similar targets are available. Experiments transitioning this therapeutic into mammalian cell systems are then described. We also illustrate how <b>SMaRT</b> RNA <b>repair</b> {{can be used to}} correct β-globin mutations involved in sickle cell disease and some forms of β- thalassemia. We uncovered diverse repair efficiencies when targeting sickle cell versus β- thalassemia transcripts in mammalian cells. Possible reasons for this and how it might direct target choice for the SMaRT therapeutic approach are both discussed. The therapeutic molecule in SMaRT, a Pre-Trans-splicing Molecule or PTM, is also delivered via lentivirus to erythrocyte precursors cultured from the peripheral blood of sickle cell patients. Preliminary results from these experiments are discussed. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|Spliceosome-mediated RNA trans-splicing (SMaRT) is an {{emerging}} {{technology for the}} repair of defective premessenger RNA (pre-mRNA) molecules. It is especially useful {{in the treatment of}} genetic disorders involving large genes. Although viral vectors have been used for achieving long-lasting expression of trans-splicing molecules, the immunogenicity and suboptimal safety profiles associated with viral-based components could limit the widespread application of <b>SMaRT</b> in the <b>repair</b> of genetic defects. Here, we tested whether the non-viral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system could mediate stable delivery of trans-splicing molecules designed to correct the genetic defect responsible for severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). This immunological disorder is caused by a point mutation within the 12. 4 kilobase (kb) gen...|$|R
40|$|We study {{a system}} {{consisting}} of one repair shop and one stockpoint, where spare parts of multiple critical repairables are kept on stock to serve an installed base of technical systems. Part requests are met from stock if possible, and backordered otherwise. The {{objective is to}} minimize aggregate downtime via <b>smart</b> <b>repair</b> job scheduling. We evaluate various relevant dynamic scheduling policies, including two that stem from other application fields. One {{of them is the}} myopic allocation rule from the make-to-stock environment. It selects the SKU with the highest expected backorder reduction per invested time unit and has excellent performance on repairable inventory systems. It combines the following three strengths: (i) it selects the SKU with the shortest expected repair time in case of backorders, (ii) it recognizes the benefits of short average repair times even if there are no backorders, and (iii) it takes the stochasticity of the part failure processes into account. We investigate the optimality gaps of the heuristic scheduling rules, compare their performance on a large test bed containing problem instances of real-life size, and illustrate the impact of key problem characteristics on the aggregate downtime. We show that the myopic allocation rule performs well and that it outperforms the other heuristic scheduling rules...|$|E
40|$|An energy-aware on-demand Bluetooth {{scatternet}} {{formation and}} routing protocol {{taking into account}} network architecture and traffic pattern is proposed. The scatternet formation protocol is {{able to cope with}} multiple sources initiating traffic simultaneously as well as prolong network lifetime. A modified Inquiry scheme using extended ID packet is introduced for fast device discovery and power efficient propagation of route request messages with low delay. A mechanism employing POLL packets in Page processes is proposed to transfer scatternet formation and route reply information without extra overhead. In addition, the energy aware forwarding nodes selection scheme is based on local information and results in more uniform network resource utilization and improved network lifetime. Simulation results show that this protocol can provide scatternet formation with reasonable delay and with good load balance which results in prolonged network lifetime for Bluetooth-based wireless sensor networks. In this research, a metric-based scatternet formation algorithm for the Bluetooth-based sensor motes is presented. It optimizes the Bluetooth network formation from the hop distance and link quality perspectives. In addition, a <b>smart</b> <b>repair</b> mechanism is proposed to deal with link/node failure and recover the network connectivity promptly with low overhead. The experiments with the Intel Mote platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimizations. This research also investigates the scalability of ad hoc routing protocols in very large-scale wireless ad hoc networks. A comprehensive simulation study is conducted of the performance of an on-demand routing protocol on a very large-scale, with as many as 50, 000 nodes in the network. The scalability analysis is addressed based on various network sizes, node density, traffic load, and mobility. The reasons for packet loss are analyzed and categorized at each network layer. Based on the observations, we observe the effect of the parameter selection and try to exhaust the scalability boundary of the on-demand routing protocol for wireless ad hoc networks. Ph. D.

40|$|Although {{there exists}} formal {{development}} support, {{as well as}} informal de-sign guidelines, a lot of protocols, whether recent or not, are faulty. Further aid for protocol development is thus required. We have developed Shrimp, a <b>Smart</b> metHod for <b>Repairing</b> IMperfect security Protocols, aims at speeding up the formal software development cycle, bridging the gap between design and anal-ysis by means of diagnosis and repair. It offers benefits to practising security engineers, including getting a better insight into a protocol flaw and enabling incremental protocol design. Shrimp relies on existing state-of-the-art tools both to analyse an (interme-diate) protocol and, if the protocol is flawed, to find {{one or more of}} protocol runs violating a given security requirement, called an attack. It then analyses the protocol and the attack 3 to pinpoint the faulty steps of the protocol and synthesises appropriate changes to fix them. This yields an improved version of the protocol that should be analysed and potentially patched again until no further flaws can be detected...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{properties}} such as {{the natural}} frequency of a structure have {{a significant role in}} the design process. The importance of this consideration is because of resonance. In this case, the amplitude of the vibration is magnified to levels that may lead to a catastrophic event. While the usual design process depends on the collected experiences and statistical data, a developing trend is to implement smart technologies to develop smart structures that are capable of self-monitoring, diagnostics and <b>repair.</b> <b>Smart</b> material components such as shape memory alloys (SMAs) and piezoelectric ceramics are increasingly being used by vibration control practitioners. In this paper, the alteration of the natural frequency of composite structures using nitinol-based shape memory alloy wires will be presented using the analyses of strain energy perturbations on a plate. These governing strain equations will be solved analytically and numerically to show the effect of point forces acting in a distributive manner and the subsequent effect it has on the plate&# 039;s stiffness and hence it&# 039;s natural frequency. Different SMA configurations placement will be studied and compared to computational and experimental findings in order to optimize the control strategy...|$|R
