40|$|Thesis (MIng (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 During {{this study}} an {{experimental}} test facility {{was designed and}} constructed {{with the purpose of}} conducting experiments to measure the pressure drop through packed beds of spheres with varying levels of structuredness. The test facility had to be designed so that the uncertainty in the measured friction factors would be below Â± 10 % and commissioned to ensure that results with an acceptable degree of accuracy could be obtained. Experiments were done on a randomly packed bed and a <b>structured</b> <b>packed</b> bed in order to demonstrate the proper operation of the test facility. The resulting experimental data was compared with applicable correlations found from relevant literature. The nuclear safety standards commission (KTA (1981)) correlation, as well as the relation of Ergun (1952) was chosen for comparison with the experimental data obtained from the experiment on the randomly packed bed. The correlation of Wentz and Thodos (1963) was selected for comparison with the experimental data obtained from the <b>structured</b> <b>packed</b> bed experiment. The friction factors obtained from the experimental data was found to be higher than the friction factors calculated with the different correlations for the respective packing configurations. This could be attributed to the manufacturing process of the packing configurations that resulted in the surface finish of the particles to be extremely coarse. In order to obtain the desired porosity within the <b>structured</b> <b>packed</b> bed, cylindrical rods were utilised to separate the particles to prevent contact between them. Wentz and Thodos (1963) also made use of cylindrical rods, called distention rods, to make varying porosity possible within the <b>structured</b> <b>packed</b> beds. The cylindrical rods that were utilised during these experiments are larger (in diameter) than those described in the literature, which could have contributed to the higher pressure drop through the <b>structured</b> <b>packed</b> bed. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} friction factors derived from the experimental data increased as the modified Reynolds number was increased. This is a phenomenon that is not fully understood at this time and further study is proposed. The operation of the experimental test facility was successfully demonstrated. The measurements were shown to be repeatable and the uncertainty of the friction factors derived from the measured data obtained from the test facility was less than 10 %, which is satisfactory. Therefore, the ability to measure the pressure drop through packed beds of spheres with varying degrees of structuredness has now been established as a result of this research. Master...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 8 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Mauritius, 11 - 13 July, 2011. Randomly packed beds are widely used {{in a variety of}} industries, because of their low cost and ease of use compared with other packing methods. However, the pressure drops in such packed beds are usually much higher than those in other packings, and the overall heat transfer performances may be greatly lowered. In order to reduce the pressure drops and improve the overall heat transfer performances of <b>packed</b> beds, <b>structured</b> packings are considered to be promising choices. In this paper, some of our recent contributions on the hydrodynamic and heat transfer characteristics in some novel <b>structured</b> <b>packed</b> beds are introduced, where the effects of packing form and particle shape are carefully investigated, and the numerical and experimental results are also compared in detail. Firstly, it is found that, with proper selection of packing form and particle shape, the pressure drops in the <b>structured</b> <b>packed</b> beds can be greatly reduced and the overall heat transfer performances will be improved. The traditional correlations of flow and heat transfer extracted from random packings are found to overpredict the pressure drops and Nusselt numbers for all the structured packings, and some modified correlations are obtained. Secondly, it is revealed that, both the effects of packing form and particle shape are significant on the flow and heat transfer in <b>structured</b> <b>packed</b> beds. With the same particle shape (sphere), the overall heat transfer efficiency of SC packing is the highest. With the same packing form, such as FCC or SC packings, the overall heat transfer performance of ellipsoidal particle model is better.

50|$|The column can {{be filled}} with random dumped packing (creating a random packed column) or with <b>structured</b> <b>packing</b> sections, which are {{arranged}} or stacked (creating a stacked packed column). In the column, liquids tend to wet {{the surface of the}} packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where mass transfer takes place. Packing material can be used instead of trays to improve separation in distillation columns. Packing offers the advantage of a lower pressure drop across the column (when compared to plates or trays), which is beneficial while operating under vacuum.

Each packing material of this newer generation improves the surface area, the flow area, and/or the associated pressure drop across the packing.
