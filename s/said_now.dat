According to Lindsay: [...] "When the song ended we both just looked at each other. I <b>said,</b> <b>Now</b> what the fuck are we gonna do?' With that single, the Beatles raised the ante as to what a pop record should be." [...] Lindsay ensured that the clips for both sides of the single were broadcast on the Raiders' television show, Where the Action Is.|$|E
500|$|Shaw's {{admiration for}} Mussolini and Stalin {{demonstrated}} his growing belief that dictatorship {{was the only}} viable political arrangement. When the Nazi Party {{came to power in}} Germany in January 1933, Shaw described Hitler as [...] "a very remarkable man, a very able man", and professed himself proud to be the only writer in England who was [...] "scrupulously polite and just to Hitler". His principal admiration was for Stalin, whose regime he championed uncritically throughout the decade. Shaw saw the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact as a triumph for Stalin who, he <b>said,</b> <b>now</b> had Hitler under his thumb.|$|E

He declined to say what prompted his resignation {{and said that he}} might not be permanently finished with baseball, but {{he said that he was}} finished with the Kansas City club. When asked about the possibility of a major league managing job, Shay responded, [...] "There is nothing to be <b>said</b> <b>now,</b> but there may be something later." ...|$|E

500|$|If The Good Wife had {{not been}} {{successful}} and the first season was not renewed beyond its first 13 episodes, creators Robert and Michelle King planned to end their final episode with {{a scene in which}} Peter returns home and greets his emotionally conflicted wife; because the season was continued, it ultimately became the opening scene of [...] "Bang". Robert King said he considered using it as a final scene because, [...] "You would never have wanted to end it where it would be such a conclusion that everyone’s satisfied, because that’s not Alicia’s life.

2500|$|By February 1942 Japanese {{forces had}} gained footholds in territories {{adjoining}} northern Australia {{which made it}} seem probable that the advance southwards would continue, culminating in the invasion of Australia. This threat of invasion in 1942 is summarised in a statement made by Prime Minister Curtin in 1944, in which he <b>said</b> <b>now</b> that Singapore was lost and {{we were unable to}} concentrate a superior fleet, the strength of our defences was inadequate to defend Australia ... against an enemy with command of the sea and air. We lacked air support, possessing no fighters whatsoever, and our bomber and reconnaissance planes had been reduced to about 50 machines.

2500|$|On 12 November, Eritrea's {{envoy to}} Nairobi Beyene Russom {{told the press}} that his {{government}} had no objections vis-a-vis Operation Linda Nchi. He blamed the allegations that Eritrea was supplying weapons to Al-Shabaab on lack of due diligence {{on the part of}} the media. Russom also accused Ethiopia, stating that [...] "We have nothing against Kenya. This piling up of accusations is the work, as we believe, of Ethiopia to camouflage its illegal military occupation of Eritrean territory. What is being <b>said</b> <b>now</b> about the planeload of weapons to Al-Shabaab again we believe is a creation of Ethiopia." [...] With regard to Wetangula's warning that the Kenyan government would sever ties, Russom indicated that Asmara believed the Kenyan authorities were acting on false information.

When asked for more details on where the rest of the Conners (Dan, Jackie, Becky, Darlene, David, and Mark) would be, Barr responded: [...] "Your question is intellectual property that may be developed later, so I don't want to get into that". She added, [...] "No preview, absolutely not". On December 20, 2009, Barr posted an entry on her Web site regarding what a possible Roseanne reunion would be like, which includes: DJ's being published, Mark's dying in Iraq; David's leaving Darlene for a woman half his age, Darlene coming out of the closet and meeting a woman and having a test tube baby with her, Becky's working at Walmart, Roseanne and Jackie's opening the first medical marijuana dispensary in Lanford, Arnie's becoming the best friend of the Governor of Illinois and remarrying Nancy, Bev's selling a painting for $10,000, Jerry and the grandsons forming a music group similar to the Jonas Brothers, Dan's reappearing alive after faking his death, and Bonnie's being arrested for selling crack.|$|E
2500|$|Muhammad IV and {{his successors}} Hassan I and [...] Abd al-Aziz moved {{the court and}} capital back to Fez, demoting Marrakesh once again to a {{regional}} capital under a family khalifa. [...] Nonetheless, Marrakesh was still visited periodically, and numerous new buildings were erected, most notably the late 19th-century palaces of various leading courtiers and officials. The Bahia Palace ("the Brilliant") {{was built in the}} 1860s as the residence of Si Musa, a palace slave and grand vizier of Muhammad IV and Hassan I. It was used as a residence by Si Musa's son and successor Ahmed ibn Musa ("Ba Ahmed"), who served as the grand vizier of Abd al-Aziz. [...] Other Alawite palaces of this era include the Dar Si <b>Said</b> (<b>now</b> the Museum of Moroccan Art), built by Ba Ahmed's brother, Si Said ibn Musa, the Dar Menebbi (now the Musée de Marrakech) built by the Tangier noble and war minister Mehdi el-Menebbi and the early 20th-century palace of Dar el Glaoui, residence of the pasha Thami El Glaoui. [...] The late 19th century also saw the erection of many new religious buildings, such as the Sufi shrine of Sidi Abd al-Aziz and the mosques of Sidi Ishaq, Darb al-Badi, Darb al-Shtuka, Dar al-Makzhen and Ali ibn Sharif.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{occasion}} {{happened during}} the period 1965–1975 in New York City, as musicians of Cuban and Puerto-Rican origin combined to produce the great music of the post Cha-cha-cha period. This music acquired the label of 'salsa'. No-one really knows how this happened, but everyone recognised what a benefit {{it was to have}} a common label for son, mambo, guaracha, guajira, guaguancó, etc. Cubans and non Cubans, such as Tito Puente, Rubén Blades and many experts of the Cuban music and salsa have always said [...] "Salsa is just another name for Cuban, music. Tito Puentes once <b>said,</b> <b>now</b> they call it Salsa, later they may call it Stir Fry, but to me it will alway be Cuban Music"; but over time salsa bands worked in other influences. For example, in the late 1960s Willie Colón developed numbers that made use of Brazilian rhythms. New York radio programmes offered 'salsarengue' as a further combination. You look at a band of the 1940s playing Cuban music and you will see the same exact instruments in Salsa Music. Later still 'Salsa romantica' was the label for an especially sugary type of bolero. Even when, Benny Moré, Perez Prado the greatest Sonero that ever existed, was singing Boleros with a salsa cadence in the 1940s. It was not until the 1950s that Cuban music became popular for Puerto Rican bands. Plena, Bomba an other styles or music were popular at the time in Puerto Rico. Many famous Puerto Rican musicians went to learn the music styles of Cubans in the 1930s and 1940s, and {{it was not until the}} arrival of Castro in 1959 and the Cuban music stopped its exportation to the world, that Puerto Ricans in New York were able to be greatly noticed, but what is known as Salsa today, was brought to New York in the 1920s and 1930s by Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo, this last one was discovered by Dizzy Gillespie as he was one of the greatest percussionist that ever lived.|$|E
