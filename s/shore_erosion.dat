While the northern {{areas of the}} Altiplano Cundiboyacense were affected by the near-surface volcanism of Paipa and Iza, both in Boyacá, the volcanic area closer to the Eastern Hills was located around present-day Guatavita. The volcanism here has been analysed to have been post-Andean uplift. The Plio–Pleistocene period was marked {{by the presence of}} a fluvio-lacustrine depositional environment (Lake Humboldt) on the Bogotá savanna, sourced by rivers running off the Eastern Hills. The sedimentological record revealed various stages of infill, where the smaller-scale setting was determined by the paleo-water level and climate conditions. During the coldest periods, Lake Humboldt was surrounded by páramo ecosystems, with plant growth around the lake reducing lake <b>shore</b> <b>erosion.</b> The Latest Pleistocene was characterised by a period of cooling with a minor glacier present in the highest part of the central Eastern Hills.Moraines in this area have been dated to 18,000 until 15,500 years BP, in the late Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E

50|$|A {{headland}} (or simply head) is {{a coastal}} landform, {{a point of}} land usually high and often with a sheer drop, that extends out into a body of water. It {{is a type of}} promontory.

30|$|In general, an {{intensified}} global {{water cycle}} is expected worldwide, which would {{also lead to}} an increase in flood risks [9]. The direct role that climate change may play in causing extreme events such as 100 -year floods has not yet been conclusively demonstrated [10]. However, a number of anthropogenic activities have significantly contributed to the increase or exacerbation of the intensity and frequency of floods worldwide through the alteration of natural river channels, the habitation of floodplain areas, changes in land use that can increase water runoff, and erosion during heavy rainfall events [6, 11]. Furthermore, the increase in economic value of floodplain areas (e.g., urbanization) leads to an increase in the expected damage caused by flood events. The processes or results of <b>shore</b> <b>erosions</b> and collapses from flood events can impact valuable arable land, roads, buildings, and other anthropogenic activities. In addition, eroded materials associated with flood events can be deposited such that they limit human activities (e.g., ports, waterways). Impairment of water quality can also occur with flood events through exceedances or damage to drinking and wastewater-treatment plants that may promote the growth of harmful microbial communities that directly impair the water supplies to dependent communities.|$|R

They also practice eco-conservation and do not kill mollusks for their shells, dig holes in the sand, or gouge cliff faces for fossils or reefs for coral specimens. Many beachcombers serve as excellent stewards of the seashore, working with government agencies to monitor <b>shore</b> <b>erosion,</b> dumping and pollution, and reef and cliff damage, etc.|$|E
50|$|Because the North Korean side of {{the river}} is mountainous and the Russian side is lower, <b>shore</b> <b>erosion</b> may cause the Tumen River, which floods annually, to {{gradually}} change its course toward the Russian side. (A similar phenomenon is seen on the China-Russia border, with the Amur River.) To prevent the loss of national territory, and to shield Khasan and the Peschanaya border guard station from flooding, Russian authorities carried out a riverbank protection project using rock fill from 2004-2008.|$|E

50|$|The island {{became a}} {{peninsula}} {{in the early}} 20th century when the Gallaudet Aircraft Company constructed America's first seaplane-only factory at Chepiwanoxet cc. 1916. For truck access to the factory, fill was dumped into the marsh, making a causeway from Alger Avenue that still remains. As a result of blocking water circulation around the island, Arnold Cove lost its boat channel from silt deposits in the tidal marsh located on the North side of the island. With the island made of sand deposits it was subject to <b>shore</b> <b>erosion.</b> The Gallaudet Company built wood bulkheads around the North, East and South shores with rock rip-rap on the waterside and fill behind. With many factory workers living north of the old cove, a narrow wood plank bridge was built across the marsh to allow quicker access to/from work.|$|E

50|$|The {{mouth of}} the river has been {{significantly}} altered. The river originally spilled into the Bass Strait south {{of the town of}} Port Fairy through a series of narrow channels leading westward from the site of the presentday mouth. At that stage, the southern outlet of the Moyne, the Back Passage, was narrow and the opening to the sea was often too rough for boats to leave or enter the port; the main eastern outlet was blocked by a shallow sand bar. These navigational impediments led to the construction of a jetty from Flagstaff Hill and a boulder wall breakwater between Griffiths Island and Rabbit Island. Training walls constructed in the 1870s, curve from the northern part of Griffiths Island through the sand bar. These structures rapidly led to the accumulation of large amounts of sand on the north coast of Griffiths Island and back <b>shore</b> <b>erosion</b> north of the breakwaters. A protective stone wall was added in 1911.|$|E
50|$|The {{remnants}} of Opal passed across northeast Ohio and caused wind gusts up to 45 mph and sustained winds of 20 to 30 mph all across northern Ohio. Several automobiles were damaged by falling trees or limbs. Crops were damaged from the strong winds. A {{number of farms}} reported fields of corn blown over and ripe apples and other fruit being stripped from trees. Rainfall of 3.4 in in less than 24 hours was measured at Mansfield, and most areas averaged 1.5 to 2.5 in during the same period. Flooding was localized and not significant since very dry conditions preceded the storm. Sustained northeast winds ahead of the storm reached 55 mph all across the lake with gusts to 70 mph producing waves of 10 to 14 ft. Minor to moderate beach and <b>shore</b> <b>erosion</b> occurred in many areas, especially {{the western end of}} the lake.

50|$|Headlands and bays are {{two related}} coastal features. Headlands and bays are often {{found on the}} same coastline. A bay is a body of water, either {{seawater}} (salt water) or fresh water, surrounded by land on three sides, whereas a headland is land surrounded by water on three sides. Headlands are characterized by high, breaking waves, rocky <b>shores,</b> intense <b>erosion,</b> and steep sea cliffs. Bays generally have less wave activity, and often less wind activity than the areas of water outside the bay, and typically have sandy beaches. Headlands and bays form on discordant coastlines, where the land consists of bands of rock of alternating resistance that run perpendicular to the coast.|$|R
40|$|Knowledge and {{understanding}} of <b>shore</b> platform <b>erosion</b> and tidal notch development in the tropics and subtropics relies mainly on short-term studies conducted on recently deposited carbonate rocks, predominantly Holocene and Quaternary reef limestones and aeolianites. This paper presents erosion rates, measured over a 10 [*]year period on notches and platforms developed on the Permian, Ratburi limestone at Phang Nga Bay, Thailand. In so doing it contributes to informing a particular knowledge gap {{in our understanding of}} the <b>erosion</b> dynamics of <b>shore</b> platform and tidal notch development in the tropics and subtropics – notch erosion rates on relatively hard, ancient limestones measured directly on the rock surface using a micro-erosion meter (MEM) over time periods of a decade or more. The average intertidal erosion rate of 0. 231 [*]mm/yr is lower than erosion rates measured over 2 – 3 years on recent, weaker carbonate rocks. Average erosion rates at Phang Nga vary according to location and site and are, in rank order from highest to lowest: Mid-platform (0. 324 [*]mm/yr) [*]>[*]Notch floor (0. 289 [*]mm/yr) [*]>[*]Rear notch wall (0. 228 [*]mm/yr) [*]>[*]Lower platform (0. 140 [*]mm/yr) [*]>[*]Notch roof (0. 107 [*]mm/yr) and Supratidal (0. 095 [*]mm/yr). The micro-relief of the eroding rock surfaces in each of these positions exhibits marked differences that are seemingly associated with differences in dominant physical and bio-erosion processes. The results begin to help inform knowledge of longer term <b>shore</b> platform <b>erosion</b> dynamics, models of marine notch development and have implications for the use of marine notches as indicators of changes in sea level and the duration of past sea levels.

50|$|The rise in {{sea level}} along coastal regions carries {{implications}} {{for a wide}} range of habitats and inhabitants. Firstly, rising sea levels will have a serious impact on beaches— a place which humans love to visit recreationally and a prime location for real estate. It is ideal to live on the coast, due to a more moderate climate and pleasant scenery, but beachfront property is at risk from eroding land and rising sea levels. Since the threat posed by rising sea levels has become more prominent, property owners and local government have taken measures to prepare for the worst. For example, “Maine has enacted a policy declaring that shorefront buildings will have to be moved to enable beaches and wetlands to migrate inland to higher ground.” Additionally, many coastal states add sand to their beaches to offset <b>shore</b> <b>erosion,</b> and many property owners have elevated their structures in low-lying areas. As a result of the erosion and ruin of properties by large storms on coastal lands, governments have looked into buying land and having residents relocate further inland.|$|E
50|$|A {{petition}} to the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island {{was presented in}} order to build a lighthouse at Cascumpec Harbour in 1848 followed by another in 1853. The lighthouse was built on Sandy Island, at the entrance of the harbour, and became active the following year. In 1876 was built a new lighthouse because the previous was decayed by age; the white tower was 12.5 m high and a front range tower was built no far toward the shore in order to indicate the channel. In October 1879 a gale damaged heavily the tower particularly at the foundation. The area underwent to various works to fight the <b>shore</b> <b>erosion</b> and in 1899 the lighthouse was relocated toward south in a protected place. In 1901 two open towers, with enclosed lantern, replaced the lighthouse. A new light was built in October 1968, it was a skeletal tower with balcony, lantern and a central staircase covered by a wooden structure painted with white and red stripes. In 1999 the lighthouse was degraded and in 2004 the winter storms damaged the place so that the Canadian Coast Guard decided to deactivate the light and to dismantle the tower.|$|E
