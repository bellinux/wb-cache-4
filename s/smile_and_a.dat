5|$|Most of the non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) that {{inhabit the}} open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked {{their friends and}} families if {{they would like to}} appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not to move or <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> high-definition digital camera captured a 3D model of their faces. The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras was used by the designers to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons—any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers. To render the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, this deity is {{variously}} {{considered to}} be the god of wealth or of the household, particularly the kitchen. He is recognised by his wide face, <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> flat black hat, {{in stark contrast to the}} fierce imagery portrayed in Tibetan Buddhist art. He is often portrayed holding a golden mallet, otherwise known as a magic money mallet, and is seen seated on bales of rice, with mice nearby (mice signify plentiful food).|$|E

500|$|Dandy [...] is a 'well-liked {{kid with}} a ready <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> {{confident}} air' [...] {{who served in the}} American Civil War. Usually depicted wearing a Union Army uniform, he left his adoptive parents from a small Ohio farm to explore the west. He has a noticeably greater active interest in the opposite sex, as exemplified in [...] "I'll fight you for Lucy".|$|E
500|$|Audiences did {{not respond}} well to the revised version during early performances. Blake {{was on the verge}} of {{dropping}} the number from the show when a dancer was taken ill and had to be replaced. The understudy was a singer who did not know the steps, so when he was unable to follow the routine he ignored it and improvised. America's Songs quotes Sissle's recollection of how the performance saved the song: [...] "He dropped out of line and with a jive <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> high-stepping routine of his own, he stopped the show cold." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{incoming}} {{students at}} Texas A choose {{to attend the}} campus because {{they feel that the}} students are friendlier than those at other universities.

500|$|Hitler {{insisted that}} Kubizek stalk Stefanie and {{delivered}} daily reports on her activity {{while he was}} away visiting his mother or family. In one report, Kubizek wrote that Stefanie loved to dance and had taken lessons. Hitler disliked dancing and reportedly replied, [...] "Stefanie only dances because she is forced to by society on which she unfortunately depends on. Once Stefanie is my wife, she won't have the slightest desire to dance!" [...] In June 1906, Stefanie allegedly gave Hitler a <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> flower from her bouquet as she was passing him in her carriage. Kubizek later described the scene: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1943 the studio's film Casablanca won the Academy Award for Best Picture. When {{the award}} was announced, {{producer}} Hal B. Wallis {{got up to}} accept, only to find Jack Warner had rushed onstage [...] "with a broad, flashing <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> look of great self-satisfaction" [...] to take the trophy, Wallis later recalled. [...] "I couldn't believe it was happening. Casablanca had been my creation; Jack {{had absolutely nothing to}} do with it. As the audience gasped, I tried to get out of the row of seats and into the aisle, but the entire Warner family sat blocking me. I had no alternative but to sit down again, humiliated and furious.... Almost forty years later, I still haven't recovered from the shock." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first part}} of this {{sequence}} celebrated the National Health Service ("the institution which more than any other unites our nation", according to the programme), which had been founded in the year of the previous London Games in 1948. [...] Music was by Mike Oldfield. 600 dancers, all of whom were NHS staff, along with 1,200 volunteers recruited from British hospitals, entered along with children on 320 hospital beds, some of which functioned as trampolines. [...] They started a short jive routine. Watching from the tor were specially invited hospital staff and nine child patients from Great Ormond Street Hospital. The blankets on the beds illuminated and the beds were arranged to depict a child's face with a <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> tear (the Hospital Children's Charity's logo). [...] The acronym 'GOSH' then changed into the initials 'NHS', turning into the shape of a crescent moon as the children were hushed to sleep and read books by the nurses.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{standing}} only [...] tall in heels, {{she often}} caught {{the gaze of}} men in the street, being attractive and full-figured. She was always well-dressed and even went to bed with make-up on so as to [...] "look beautiful when she woke up". [...] A nephew later said that she could [...] "make a joke out of nothing", and could have [...] "walked out of a burning house with a <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> joke". She frequented Liverpool's dance halls and clubs where she was often asked to dance in jitterbug competitions with dockers, soldiers, sailors, and waiters. It was remarked that she could be as humorous as any man and would sing the popular songs of the day at any time of day or night. Her voice sounded similar to Vera Lynn's, whilst Lennon specialised in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. [...] She played the ukulele, the piano accordion, and the banjo (as did Lennon), although neither pursued music professionally. They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and talking of what they would do in the future: opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club.|$|E
500|$|Memories of his travails on Britain's behalf {{during the}} Second World War—"undoubtedly the central {{experience}} of his life", according to Johnson—were {{fundamental to the}} sense of profound betrayal Smith felt when the UK government proved one of his main adversaries as Prime Minister. The wartime plastic surgery that corrected the wounds to his face left its right side paralysed, giving him a crooked <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> somewhat blank expression, while his bodily injuries gave him a stoop and a slight limp; he also could not sit for long periods without pain. The post-colonial UK Smith encountered as Prime Minister seemed to him [...] "foreign and somewhat effete", to quote Kenneth Young, while Smith was [...] "a foreigner in all but language to most British politicians—a man of convictions so outdated, of tastes so naive, as to make mutual understanding almost impossible." [...] Smith held most of the British politicians he dealt with in extremely low esteem, considering them to have pushed him and his country into an impossible position where, he asserted in 1970, the decision to take unilateral action was [...] "forced upon us".|$|E

2500|$|With his clipped speech, cool <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> {{cigarette}} dangling impudently {{from his}} lips, Laurence Harvey {{established himself as}} the screen's perfect pin-striped cad. He could project such utter boredom that willowy debutantes would shrivel in his presence. He could also exude such charm that the same young ladies would gladly lend him their hearts, which were usually returned utterly broken... The image Mr Harvey carefully fostered for himself off screen was not far removed {{from some of the}} roles he played. [...] "I'm a flamboyant character, an extrovert who doesn't want to reveal his feelings", he once said. [...] "To bare your soul to the world, I find unutterably boring. I think part of our profession is to have a quixotic personality." ...|$|E
60|$|The bride {{leaned forward}} low. She {{and the girl}} spoke rapidly together, their tongues moving quickly like those of two serpents--a {{comparison}} that {{is not meant to}} go further. Two <b>smiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> dozen nods closed the conference.|$|R

2500|$|Serry {{performed}} with the jazz group Shep Fields and His Rippling Rhythm orchestra, [...] including during a nationwide tour which featured live radio broadcasts from the Palmer House hotel in Chicago, Illinois and the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, California over the NBC network (1937–1938). These Big band remote broadcasts were noteworthy for utilizing the Zenith Electronics Corporation's new Radiogran broadcast technology. Serry's performances {{as a member of}} the orchestra and soloist are documented in a segment of Paramount Pictures' motion picture [...] musical anthology The Big Broadcast of 1938 ("This Little Ripple Had Rhythm") [...] In addition, he recorded several popular songs of the time for Bluebird Records including: With a <b>Smile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Song (Frank Churchill/Larry Morey), Whistle While You Work (Frank Churchill/Larry Morey) and Now It Can Be Told (Irving Berlin).|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} the [...] "nu-disco" [...] revival of the early 2000s was {{described}} by music critic Tom Ewing as more interpersonal than the pop music of the 1990s: [...] "The revival of disco within pop put a spotlight on something that had gone missing over the 90s: a sense of music not just for dancing, but for dancing with someone. Disco was a music of mutual attraction: cruising, flirtation, negotiation. Its dancefloor is a space for immediate pleasure, but also for promises kept and otherwise. It’s a place where things start, but their resolution, let alone their meaning, is never clear. All of 2000s great disco number ones explore how to play this hand. Madison Avenue look to impose their will upon it, to set terms and roles. Spiller is less rigid. 'Groovejet' accepts the night’s changeability, happily sells out certainty for an amused <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> few great one-liners." ...|$|E
2500|$|Selena {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Roger Ebert, film {{critic for the}} Chicago Sun-Times, {{was impressed by the}} acting, and gave Selena three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, [...] "Young Selena is played by Becky Le Meza, who has a big <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> lot of energy. The teenage and adult Selena is played by Lopez in a star-making performance. After her strong work as the passionate lover of Jack Nicholson in the current Blood and Wine, here she creates a completely different performance, as a loyal Quintanilla who does most of her growing up on a tour bus with her dad at the wheel." [...] Entertainment Weekly believed Lopez perfected Selena's accent while [...] "studying performance footage of the pop sensation" [...] according to Nava. Lopez said [...] "you need to do your homework on this gig" [...] because Selena was [...] "fresh in the public's mind".|$|E
