500|$|The {{final cut}} of the theatrically {{released}} film runs for 142 minutes, and was dedicated to Allen Greene, Darabont's former agent who died during filming from AIDS. The film's first edit ran for nearly {{two and a half}} hours, which Glotzer considered [...] "long," [...] and several scenes were cut including a longer sequence of Red adjusting to life post incarceration; Darabont said that in test screenings the audience <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> impatient with the scene as they were already convinced that Red would not make it. Another scene cut for time showed a prison guard investigating Andy's escape tunnel; it was thought this slowed down the action. The film originally had a cold open that played out Andy's crime, with his trial playing throughout the opening credits, but these scenes were edited together to create a more [...] "punchy" [...] opening. One scripted scene, which Darabont described as his best work, was left unfilmed because of the shooting schedule. In the scene, a dreaming Red is sucked into the poster of Rita Hayworth to find himself alone and insignificant on the Pacific shore, saying [...] "I am terrified, there is no way home." [...] Darabont said that he regretted being unable to capture the scene.|$|E
2500|$|Though things <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> {{better for}} the band, Garcia's health was declining. By 1983, Garcia's {{demeanor}} onstage had appeared to change. Despite still playing the guitar with great passion and intensity, there were times that he would appear disengaged; as such, shows were often inconsistent. Years of heavy tobacco smoking had affected his voice, and he gained considerable weight. By 1984, he would often rest his chin on the microphone during performances. The so-called [...] "endless tour"—the result of years of financial risks, drug use, and poor business decisions—had taken its toll.|$|E
2500|$|The {{neighborhood}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> {{over its}} recent past when another redevelopment-related setback occurred. At {{the beginning of}} the century, Aaron Dare, former head of the Northeast New York chapter of the Urban League, began filing falsified mortgage applications for a variety of Albany properties, including Historic Pastures Village Apartments, through his company, Emerge Real Properties. He and his co-conspirators made it appear that they had the capital to borrow [...] from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to buy the properties. After the closing, he failed to repay the loans and they quickly went into default, forcing HUD to foreclose. He was eventually investigated and arrested. In 2006 he pleaded guilty to various charges of conspiracy and fraud. Two years later he was sentenced to 63 months in prison and ordered to pay almost $2 million in restitution to his victims.|$|E
6000|$|Prescott, {{standing}} shakily in the moonlight, smiled. [...] "It is surprising; but hadn't {{you better}} look after Wandle? He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> up." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> {{much closer}} <b>to</b> town," [...] {{announced}} Fred presently. [...] "I don't see a farmhouse {{of any sort}} in sight." ...|$|R
2500|$|By far {{the most}} {{persistent}} critics of the mutual housing program—and many other defense housing programs—were residents of the host communities where the projects were being built, or being planned. The residents feared additional financial burdens to be imposed on them for expanding public facilities. They were also {{very concerned about the}} quality and background of the new people moving into their community. Congress began reacting to the financial fears of potential defense housing host communities early in 1941 by passing an amendment to the Lanham Act that provided additional resources for the expansion of public facilities (i.e. schools, government offices, libraries, feeder roads, sewers, etc.) in these communities. Congress also anticipated the fears and concerns host communities would have about defense housing projects and empowered the FWA to overrule local resistance and regulations in order to expedite the provision of defense housing. [...] Residents of host communities would continue to be fearful that their new neighbors would be a lower class of people (no matter how similar to themselves they actually may have been), while also feeling resentful that others <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> a tax supported subsidy for housing when they themselves had worked [...] "long and hard" [...] to obtain their homes.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Rum, isn't it? There's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{something}} of a row about it. Norris <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> rather shirty. Hullo! here comes the Deathless Author.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, Dave, we don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> anywhere," [...] {{announced}} Phil, {{as having}} climbed over several very rough rocks, {{he stopped to}} regain his breath.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a steamer calling, {{away on the}} {{starboard}} bow," [...] he announced. [...] "She <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> nearer, too. I wonder we don't alter our course." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{certainly}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> uncomfortably {{near the}} truth. [...] "No doubt," [...] said I; [...] "but {{how do you}} know that he is anywhere upon the moor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{little man}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> further away. He said, from the {{distance}} {{to which he had}} withdrawn, [...] "You want {{to go to bed with}} three nightcaps on, like an old-clothes man." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dallas {{took up the}} narrative. 'Well, after he'd {{been gone}} about five minutes, and the row <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> worse than ever, we thought we'd better go down and investigate. So we did.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Driftwood (Groucho): [...] "Well, things {{certainly}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> better {{around the}} country." [...] Fiorello (Chico): [...] "Well, I wouldn't know about that; I'm a stranger here myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> {{about as}} much as he wants," [...] Walter replied, grimly, as he darted forward to assist Sewatis in case it should become necessary.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I guess we'd {{better be}} going, Dolf,' said peaceable Stuffy, {{feeling that it}} would be wise to retreat before another {{skirmish}} took place, as his side <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> the worst of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, ye {{might as}} well go 'long," [...] said Aunt Matilda, who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> into a bad humor. [...] "There's others who knows jist as much about yer bad doin's as Mah'sr Michaels did." ...|$|E
60|$|Susan and Mrs. Greville <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> on {{very well}} together; but Elizabeth's admiration of Ida {{seemed to be}} speechless, for they were walking side by side without a word, perhaps too close to their elders to talk.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes. You must fire {{it for me}} {{in about}} ten minutes or so, when the warriors <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> knocked up. Follow me, Hockins, and keep close." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{has great}} resolution,' said Cherry, 'but he always <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me {{a sort of}} Christian panther of the wilderness; and you <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> him into a cage.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{would like}} to think so. But as we <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> serious, isn't the {{question}} whether it prevails or not another matter from an altruistic point of view?" ...|$|R
60|$|They <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> {{deeper and}} deeper into the woods. The trees around them were so dense that it was almost {{impossible}} to see the direction of the sun. Several times they came to a halt to look around.|$|E
6000|$|... "The antennæ!" [...] said Legrand, who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> unaccountably warm {{upon the}} subject; [...] "I {{am sure you}} must see the antennæ. I made them as {{distinct}} {{as they are in}} the original insect, and I presume that is sufficient." ...|$|E
60|$|Then she sat up, and, {{far away}} in the distance, she saw a round, bright spot that {{reminded}} her of a full moon. It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> nearer and bigger, and finally she gave a cry of joy and awakened her companion.|$|E
5000|$|The second man, Lord Peter Wimsey, says: “Nowhere [...] [...] [...] De mortuis” {{and then}} some [...] [...] [...] Yes, he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> a nice derangement of epitaphs, poor old creature.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Nelly," [...] he whispered, [...] "Marian {{and that}} young man <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> on uncommonly well together. She looks sentimentally happy, and he seems pleased with himself. Dont you feel jealous?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me," [...] he said, [...] "you don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> on very well! Mr. Dory," [...] he added, {{with a note}} of {{surprise}} in his tone, [...] "this is indeed an unexpected pleasure!" ...|$|R
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> {{darker and}} darker. I {{could hear the}} sound of Peter's footsteps, and they seemed to drag as he forced his way through the bushes. And then, quite suddenly, he sat down without any warning, and when I ran up I heard him crying.|$|E
60|$|But {{her mind}} was roused to {{resistance}} of impressions that, from being obvious phantoms, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> solid in the daylight. As a strong body struggles against fumes with the more violence when they begin to be stifling, a strong soul struggles against phantasies with all the more alarmed energy when they threaten to govern {{in the place of}} thought.|$|E
60|$|Matters <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> worse {{all round}} us both in France and England. King Charles {{was in the}} hands of his enemies, and all the good news that we could hear from England was that the Duke of York had escaped in a girl's dress, and was on board the fleet at helvoetsluys, where his brother the Prince of Wales jointed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> it all round, Mr. Westover," [...] said Jeff. [...] "This {{must make}} you feel good. I don't know but I begin to believe there's a God in Israel, myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Charming!" [...] I answered. [...] "I {{am writing}} Aunt Mary to invite {{her down to}} Feltham. The {{difficulty}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hold of Delora." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I came here," [...] he said, [...] "because I didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> on in Paris. It {{struck me}} that the clue to Miss Poynton's {{disappearance}} might after all be {{on this side of}} the Channel." ...|$|R
