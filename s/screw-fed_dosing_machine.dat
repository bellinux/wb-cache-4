This road surface is claimed to be very durable and monsoon rain resistant. The plastic is sorted by hand, which is economical in India. The test road used 60 kg of plastic for an approximately 500-metre-long, 8-metre-wide, two-lane road.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide ‘semi-quantitative’ or ‘rigorous’ definitions of the fluidity, lubricity and compactibility requirements of formulation for representative dosator and dosing disc capsule filling machines. To that end, model formulations were developed for those properties using Carr's compressibility index, ejection force, and plug breaking force at a specified compression force to gauge fluidity, lubricity, and compactibility, respectively. These formulations were each encapsulated on an Hofliger-Karg GKF- 400 <b>dosing</b> disc <b>machine</b> and a Zanasi LZ- 64 dosator machine. Each machine was instrumented to measure plug compression and ejection forces. The encapsulation process was evaluated for %CV of fill-weight, ejection force, plug breaking force and the dissolution of marker drugs incorporated in the formulations. The f 2 metric was used to compare dissolution profiles. The results suggest: (1) formulations should meet different flow criteria for successful encapsulation on the two machines, (2) a relatively lower level of lubricant may be sufficient for the <b>dosing</b> disc <b>machine,</b> (3) a higher degree of formulation compactibility is needed for the dosator machine, and (4) transferring formulations between these machine types (same class, different subclass per FDA's SUPAC-IR/MR Manufacturing Equipment Addendum) could be challenging. In certain cases dissolution profiles for the same formulation filled on the two machines with equivalent compression force were different based on f 2 < 50. Overall, the results of this study suggest a range of formulation characteristics appropriate for transferring formulations between these two types of machines...|$|R

This study was performed in a commercial 1, 900 -cow dairy farm located in Piedritas (Buenos Aires, Argentina). Two commercial hybrids (A and B) were planted in experimental plots within a cornfield destined for corn silage. Hybrids were sown at a theoretical seeding rate of 60, 000, 70, 000, 80, 000, and 90, 000 seeds/ha in 4 replicates per hybrid. Plots were eight 50 -m-long rows separated by 52 cm. Corn was planted with a no-till seeder equipped with a pneumatic <b>dosing</b> <b>machine.</b> Ten plants within each plot were cut by hand at 15 cm above ground. Whole plants were chopped, weighed, mixed thoroughly, and frozen until analysis. Nutritional composition was determined by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy. Harvesting occurred at one-quarter milk-line [31. 4 % dry matter (DM) ] and one-half milk-line (34. 5 % DM) stages of maturity for hybrids B and A, respectively. No interactions between hybrid and planting density were observed for any of the variables of interest. Planting density did not affect either plant DM weight or DM, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, or starch concentrations of whole-plant corn. Dry matter yield was significantly increased at higher planting densities. The similar per-plant biomass and nutritional quality among different densities can be explained by the abundant precipitation observed during this growing season (719 mm since the beginning of fallow until harvest). In conclusion, greater yields of silage can be obtained by increasing corn planting density without affecting its nutritional composition, although the effect of planting density with limiting resources (e. g., precipitation) still needs to be elucidated...|$|R

40|$|Multiple linear {{regression}} (MLR) and machine learning techniques in pharmacogenetic algorithm-based warfarin dosing have been reported. However, performances of these algorithms in racially diverse group {{have never been}} objectively evaluated and compared. In this literature-based study, we compared the performances of eight machine learning techniques with those of MLR in a large, racially-diverse cohort. MLR, artificial neural network (ANN), regression tree (RT), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), boosted regression tree (BRT), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), lasso regression (LAR) and Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) were applied in warfarin dose algorithms in a cohort from the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium database. Covariates obtained by stepwise regression from 80 % of randomly selected patients were used to develop algorithms. To compare the performances of these algorithms, the mean percentage of patients whose predicted dose fell within 20 % of the actual dose (mean percentage within 20 %) and the mean absolute error (MAE) were calculated in the remaining 20 % of patients. The performances of these techniques in different races, {{as well as the}} dose ranges of therapeutic warfarin were compared. Robust results were obtained after 100 rounds of resampling. BART, MARS and SVR were statistically indistinguishable and significantly out performed all the other approaches in the whole cohort (MAE: 8. 84 - 8. 96 mg/week, mean percentage within 20 %: 45. 88 %- 46. 35 %). In the White population, MARS and BART showed higher mean percentage within 20 % and lower mean MAE than those of MLR (all p values < 0. 05).

Patients were randomly distributed between two groups; traditional group (M 1) received a bolus dose of Morphine as 0. 02 mg/kg body weight to a maximum of 1. 5 mg, and group (M 2) where 0. 01 mg/kg body weight to a maximum of 0. 75 mg is the bolus <b>dose.</b> PCA <b>machines</b> were set up at 6 min lockout interval and a maximum dose of 0. 15 mg/kg/h to a maximum of 10 mg/h. Rescue doses were given according to pain scores and reported. 1000 mg Paracetamol every 6 h were given. Morphine consumption at 24 and 48 h, VAS at 1, 2 then every 4 h for 48 h were measured. Reported complications as respiratory depression, over sedation, constipation, pruritus, nausea and vomiting were analyzed. ResultsMorphine consumption in small bolus size group M 2 during the first (36. 38 ± 17. 75) and second 24 h (30. 22 ± 17. 15) were less when compared to large bolus size group M 1 (39. 20 ± 17. 97 and 36. 38 ± 17. 75), the change was insignificant. In spite of using small bolus size Morphine in group M 2, pain scores were close to group M 1 and statistically insignificant. The frequency of occurrence of side effects was statistically insignificant when comparing the two groups.

The implement is an automatized operative machine {{able to perform}} mechanical non-selective treatments in the inter-row and site-specific flaming in the row space. Flaming system is basically composed by a LPG feeding system, couples of burners and an instantaneous ignition system. When the machine is coupled with the GMU developed within the RHEA project the system becomes autonomous. The application of flaming {{is based on a}} camera vision weed detection system installed on the GMU and developed by the University Complutense of Madrid. When the vision system detects weeds the signal is send to the HLDMS installed on the GMU and then to the PLC mounted on the implement that manages flaming. Three levels of weed cover (zero, low and high weed cover) were preestablished in order to perform no-treatment or treatments with low or high LPG pressure. According to the percentage of weed cover, the choice between two levels of LPG pressure is made in real-time in order to obtain the proper <b>dose.</b> The <b>machine</b> was realized to treat independently four rows of maize at each passage of the GMU.

A predictive model of mucositis could guide clinical decision-making and inform treatment planning. We aimed to generate such a model using spatial <b>dose</b> metrics and <b>machine</b> learning. Materials and methodsPredictive models of severe acute mucositis were generated using radiotherapy dose (dose–volume and spatial dose metrics) and clinical data. Penalised logistic regression, support vector classification and random forest classification (RFC) models were generated and compared. Internal validation was performed (with 100 -iteration cross-validation), using multiple metrics, including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration slope, to assess performance. Associations between covariates and severe mucositis were explored using the models. ResultsThe dose–volume-based models (standard) performed equally to those incorporating spatial information. Discrimination was similar between models, but the RFCstandard had the best calibration. The mean AUC and calibration slope for this model were 0. 71 (s. d. = 0. 09) and 3. 9 (s. d. = 2. 2), respectively.

40|$|Proton {{radiotherapy}} has {{advantages to}} deliver accurate high conformal radiation dose to the tumor while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue and critical structures. However, the treatment effectiveness is degraded greatly due to patient free breathing during treatment delivery. Motion compensation for proton radiotherapy is especially challenging as proton beam is {{more sensitive to}} the density change along the beam path. Tumor respiratory motion during treatment delivery will affect the proton dose distribution and the selection of optimized parameters for treatment planning, which has not been fully addressed yet in the existing approaches for proton dose calculation. The purpose of this dissertation is to develop an approach for more accurate dose delivery to a moving tumor in proton radiotherapy, i. e., 4 D proton dose calculation and delivery, for the uniform scanning proton beam. A three-step approach has been carried out to achieve this goal. First, a solution for the proton output factor calculation which will convert the prescribed <b>dose</b> to <b>machine</b> deliverable monitor unit for proton dose delivery has been proposed and implemented. The novel sector integration method is accurate and time saving, which considers the various beam scanning patterns and treatment field parameters, such as aperture shape, aperture size, measuring position, beam range, and beam modulation. Second, tumor respiratory motion behavior has been statistically characterized and the results have been applied to advanced image guided radiation treatment. Different statistical analysis and correlation discovery approaches have been investigated. The internal / external motion correlation patterns have been simulated, analyzed, and applied in a new hybrid gated treatment to improve the target coverage. Third, a dose calculation method has been developed for 4 D proton treatment planning which integrates the interplay effects of tumor respiratory motion patterns and proton beam delivery mechanism. These three steps provide an innovative integrated framework for accurate 4 D proton dose calculation and treatment planning for a moving tumor, which extends the functionalities of existing 3 D planning systems. In short, this dissertation work addresses a few important problems for effective proton radiotherapy to a moving target. The outcomes of the dissertation are very useful for motion compensation with advanced image guided proton treatment. ...|$|R

A RadEye detector recorded data every 25 seconds throughout the day. Technologists logged their activities as follows: dose draw/injection, patient positioning, patient transport, patient care and non-specific. One technologist performed dose drawing/injection manually while others used the Trasis system. The Trasis machine was monitored with a Radeye detector during the period as well. *	Results: The average dose reduction brought by Trasis is 75 % for dose draw and 70 % for dose injection. Qualitatively, instead of dose draw/injection, patient positioning {{has become the most}} significant contributing factor to overall PET technologist dose. In addition, the current average daily dose for a PET technologist is about 0. 03 mSv, which on average is 36 % less than before [12]. PET technologists typically received a dose of 0. 007 mSv from dose draw/injection, 0. 005 mSv from patient transport, 0. 013 mSv from patient positioning, 0. 001 mSv from patient care, and 0. 003 mSv from non-specific per working day. This would result in an annual dose of 8 mSv which is approximately 16 % of occupational dose limit (50 mSv). *	Conclusions: The installation of automatic <b>dose</b> draw/injection <b>machine</b> has clear benefits to the PET technologists. The radiation doses for PET technologists are well within the annual limit of doses to occupational radiation workers. Project 2 : Validation of ceiling shielding in CT/PET room with RADEYE *	Purpose: To measure and the magnitude of scattered radiation levels in CT/PET suite and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} shielding of the ceiling. *	Materials & Methods: Six RadEye detectors were placed in the CT/PET room, four in the ceiling, and two at one meter above floor. A RadEye detector recorded data every 25 seconds throughout the day. The detector was turned on at the beginning of the day (6 am) and the doses were transferred to a laptop for analysis at the end of the day (5 pm). The dose to a non-radiation worker above the CT/PET room was estimated based on the ceiling data. The magnitude of transmitted CT radiation in the room above was measured separately with RadEye. *	Results: The CT dose contributed about 80 % of the total dose while the PET contributed 20 % within the scanning room. No dose contribution was measured above the floor from CT scanning. The combined dose from both PET and CT scan in a room above at 2. 2 meter was 2. 4 x 10 - 6 mSv per week, assuming an occupancy factor of 1. *	Conclusions: This study quantified the CT and PET doses contributions separately in the clinical CT/PET room. An analytical model was developed to calculate the non-occupational personnel dose above the CT/PET room and the calculated results were confirmed by physical measurements. The actual physical dose was much smaller than the NCRP design goals of 0. 02 mSv/wk. Project 3 : Evaluating MOSFET dependency on effective energy over diagnostic energy range	 *	 Purpose: To characterize MOSFET calibration factors (CF) as a function of effective energy over diagnostic energy range. *	Materials & Methods: Five new MOSFETs were used in the study. The calibration factors were measured in two ways: 1) fixed kVp, fixed SSD, fixed FOV, and varying filtration; and 2) fixed filtration, fixed SSD, fixed FOV, and varying kVp. Effective energy was computed as a function of kVp and filtration by SpekCalc. *	Results: CF was independent with HVL in the range of HVL = 5 to HVL = 9 mm Al at a fixed 120 kVp. CF depended linearly with kilo-voltage (kVp) from 80 to 140 kVp at a fixed filtration. In addition, a strong non-linear correlation of average CF versus effective energy was generated for effective energies in the diagnostic range (Goodness of fit of 0. 98). *	Conclusions: A correlation of second degree polynomial was seen between calibration factor and effective energy over diagnostic range. Hence, we created a calibration curve so that under a given fixed kVp or filtration, the calibration factor is automatically generated. A high correlation between CF versus effective energy was found over the diagnostic energy from 45 keV to 65 keV. This suggests that we could estimate the calibration factor with in-house generated MOSFET aging data, which would have a direct impacted CF linearly. Thesi...|$|R

TL response of Ge-doped optical fibre following X-ray irradiations was found to be linear in medical radiotheraphy dose range up to 10 Gy. In fading studies, a total of 30 samples of Ge- doped optical fibres were simultaneously irradiated, first to 2 Gy of X-rays and then subsequently to 10 Gy of X-ray dose. The performance of Ge-doped optical fibres was then compared against the currently available TL material i. e. TLD- 700 (LiF:Mg,Ti). The average reading from five repeated measurements on both types of TL material were recorded on a daily basis over a period of six days. After irradiation, and until readout, the samples were kept in the lightproof container at a room temperature. Six days after irradiation, the Ge-doped optical fibre exposed to 2 Gy showed a 26. 2 % loss of signal compared to the yield obtained 24 hours after irradiation, while at 10 Gy the fibre showed a loss of 19. 7 %. Conversely, for TLD- 700 the respective values were 75. 9 % and 36. 1 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Purpose To {{retrospectively}} {{evaluate the}} results after a regimen of surgery, IORT (intraoperative radiotherapy), and EBRT (external beam radiotherapy) for soft-tissue sarcomas Methods 38 consecutive patients underwent IORT for soft-tissue sarcoma; 29 were treated for primary tumours, 9 for recurrences. There were 14 cases with liposarcomas, 8 with leiomyosarcomas, 7 with malignant fibrous histiocytomas. 27 / 38 tumours {{were located in}} the extremities, the remaining ones in the retroperitoneum or the chest. Radical resection was attempted in all patients; a R 0 -resection was achieved in 15 / 38 patients, R 1 in 12 / 38 pats and R 2 in 4 / 38 pats. IORT was performed using a J- 125 source and a HDR (high <b>dose</b> rate) afterloading <b>machine</b> after suturing silicone flaps to the tumour bed. The total dose applied ranged from 8 – 15 Gy/ 0. 5 cm tissue depth measured from the flap surface. After wound healing external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) was applied in 31 / 38 patients with total doses of 23 – 56 Gy dependent on resection status and wound situation. The mean duration of follow-up was 2. 3 years. Results A local recurrence was found in 10 / 36 patients, lymph node metastases in 2 / 35, and distant metastases in 6 / 35 patients. The actuarial local control rate was 63 %/ 5 years. The overall survival rate was 57 %/ 5 years. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the results after treatment for primaries or for recurrences. Late toxicity to the skin was found in 13 / 31 patients, wound healing problems in 5 / 31 patients. A neuropathy was never seen. Conclusion The combination of surgery, IORT, and EBRT yields favourable local control and survival data which are well within the range of the results reported in the literature. The complication rates, however, are considerable although the complications are not severe, they should be taken into account when therapy decisions are made. </p...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic multileaf {{collimator}} (DMLC) and static multileaf collimator (SMLC), {{along with}} three-dimensional treatment planning system (3 -D TPS), {{open the possibility}} of tissue compensation. A method using electronic tissue compensator (ETC) has been implemented in Eclipse 3 -D TPS (V 7. 3, Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, USA) at our center. The ETC was tested for head and neck conformal radiotherapy planning. The {{purpose of this study}} was to verify the feasibility of DMLC and SMLC in head and neck field irradiation for delivering homogeneous dose in the midplane at a pre-defined depth. In addition, emphasis was given to the dosimetric aspects in commissioning ETC in Eclipse. A Head and Neck Phantom (The Phantom Laboratory, USA) was used for the dosimetric verification. Planning was carried out for both DMLC and SMLC ETC plans. The dose calculated at central axis by eclipse with DMLC and SMLC was noted. This was compared with the <b>doses</b> measured on <b>machine</b> with ion chamber and thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD). The calculated isodose curves and profiles were compared with the measured ones. The dose profiles along the two major axes from Eclipse were also compared with the profiles obtained from Amorphous Silicon (AS 500) Electronic portal imaging device (EPID) on Clinac 6 EX <b>machine.</b> In uniform <b>dose</b> regions, measured dose values agreed with the calculated doses within 3 %. Agreement between calculated and measured isodoses in the dose gradient zone was within 3 mm. The isodose curves and the profiles were found to be in good agreement with the measured curves and profiles. The measured and the calculated dose profiles along the two major axes were flat for both DMLC and SMLC. The dosimetric verification of ETC for both the linacs demonstrated the feasibility and the accuracy of the ETC treatment modality for achieving uniform dose distributions. Therefore, ETC can be used as a tool in head and neck treatment planning optimization for improved dose uniformity...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAimThe aim of {{the present}} study was to apply the Figure of Merit (FOM) concept to High Dose Rate (HDR) {{interstitial}} brachytherapy treatments delivered for carcinoma of the cervix at the Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, in order to evaluate the radiobiological quality of the implants. Materials/MethodsTwenty seven patients received external beam radiotherapy, as 50 Gy in 25 fractions over five weeks, followed by interstitial brachytherapy by the HDR template technique on a Gammamed HDR <b>machine.</b> <b>Doses</b> were delivered 5 mm from the periphery of the implant along the transverse plane. Points in the bladder and rectum, receiving the maximum dose rate, were used for the evaluation of total dose received by these critical organs. BED and FOM values were evaluated for all patients. ResultsTwo patients had a rectal FOM value greater than 10. A FOM bladder value of higher than 10 was observed in six patients. Only in one patient were FOM values for both the rectum and bladder found to be above 10. The relationship between FOM values for the rectum and the bladder indicated that most FOM values were clustered near the initial portion of the scattergram obtained. For one patient the rectal FOM value was above 10, while the FOM for the bladder was significantly smaller. In another patient, having a high FOM value for the bladder, the FOM value for the rectum was also above the critical value of 10. ConclusionsGood physical optimization can lead to good radiobiological optimization, as observed in our study. Radiobiology can not improve a bad quality implant. HDR interstitial brachytherapy, which gives better geometrical sparing for critical normal organs such as the rectum and bladder, should be the treatment of choice for patients with carcinoma of the cervix. In optimizing treatment for a patient, the maximizing of FOM should be supplemented by a comparison of reference BED values and new treatments for the tumour, rectum and bladder...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to study the interactions of microbial activity, biocide usage and creation, and chemical changes in the papermaking process. The main focus was on oxidative biocide systems. In addition, new measurement and biocide production methods were applied to papermaking, and evaluated for the monitoring {{and control of the}} microbiological state and biocide usage. The measurement methods were based on portable handheld online equipments whereas the biocide production was based on electrochemical generation of biocides. The trials were mainly performed in pilot scale with actual process samples and complemented with a few laboratory trials. Most of the pilot results were verified in several field studies at paper machines. In the studies also the applicability of monitoring tools were evaluated. Biocide <b>dosing</b> itself, paper <b>machine</b> breaks, and poor management of broke generated chemical variations, which were detrimental to the papermaking process. Spoilage of broke due to poor broke management and poor biocide performance decreased the system pH, increased the conductivity, and caused the defects to the web. These chemical variations were also observed to cause variations in the cationic demand values. This probably caused unwanted particle flocculation generating the spots and holes to the web. Base paper defects were observed to cause runnability problems also at the coating machine. This cyclicity, where chemical variations cause breaks and breaks cause chemical variations, should be eliminated in order to restore good runnability. When revealing many such cause-effect relations and hidden phenomena, hand-held instrumentation gives additional references for existing basic measurements such as pH, conductivity, and redox potential. This work also took in use measurements which have not been traditionally used in papermaking such as measurement of halogens, dissolved calcium, and dissolved oxygen contents. ATP content measurement using a portable luminometer was found to be useful and easy-to-use method for evaluating microbial activity and optimizing biocide performance at paper mills. This thesis introduces a new biocide concept which can be used to prevent both microbial and biocidal problems described above. The results demonstrate how electrochemical on-site production can decrease chemical variations and improve biocide performance compared to current best practices offering an efficient and economically attractive alternative for microbial control...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundCancer {{incidence}} and its mortality {{depend on a}} number of factors, including age, socio-economic status and geographic situation, and its incidence is growing around the world [1]. Cancer incidence in Europe is now about 4000 patients per million per year and due to the ageing population a yearly increase of 1 – 1. 5 % in cancer cases is estimated in the next two decades [2 – 4]. Most of the cancer treatments will include external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy. Brachytherapy has increased its use as a radical or palliative treatment and become more sophisticated with the spread of pulsed dose rate and high <b>dose</b> rate afterloading <b>machines,</b> and the use of new planning systems has additionally improved quality of treatment [5 – 14]AimThe aim {{of the present study was}} to compare two countries (Poland and Spain) and to report the differences in the use of brachytherapy in these countries. For this reason, several characteristics related to brachytherapy were compared. Materials/MethodsThe data used were collected using a website questionnaire for the year 2002 where every centre that participated in the survey could introduce, change or update the information requested. Hospitals included in the study were those that provided data on brachytherapy, because our objective was to compare the brachytherapy facilities between Poland and Spain. ResultsData were available for 22 centres in Poland and 39 centres in Spain that provided brachytherapy in 2002. Spain having more centres that applied brachytherapy (1. 0 centre per 1, 000, 000 inhabitants in Spain vs. 0. 6 centre per 1, 000, 000 inhabitants in Poland), the average number of brachytherapy patients per centre is lower in Spain than in Poland, 137 and 382 respectively. The 5 main tumour sites treated with brachytherapy in Poland were: gynaecological (73. 7 %), bronchus (13. 0 %), breast (2. 8 %), prostate (2. 4 %) and head and neck (1. 6 %). In Spain they were: gynaecological (59. 7 %), breast (15. 4 %), prostate (12. 8 %), head and neck (4. 2 %) and bronchus (1. 5 %). Statistically significant differences were found in the number of gynaecological, bronchial and breast brachytherapy patients between the countries. ConclusionsAlthough both countries belong to the European Union, there were observed several differences in the use of brachytherapy. We also found some differences in the brachytherapy techniques used in prostate and head and neck cancers...|$|R
40|$|Granular {{media are}} omnipresent {{in the food}} industry, whether as raw materials, {{intermediate}} or final products. While {{a lot has been}} done already in modelling food processes dealing with liquids, solid and gases, very little exists until now in granular flow modelling. The present thesis takes up the challenge of producing realistic granular simulations via DEM and validating them experimentally. Indeed DEM {{is one of the most}} promising granular media simulation approaches, but its wide application is still restrained by the limited number of particles that can be considered and the small collection of comparisons with experimental data. Yet it will be shown in this thesis that DEM is indeed a powerful tool for realistic modelling. We focus on two granular systems relevant to the food industry, for which we carry out in parallel simulations and physical experiments. First we study the size segregation of cereals in a vertically vibrated cereal box. Three configurations are tested experimentally, and compared with simulations achieving a qualitative validation. The importance of convection rolls and the role of particle and wall friction coefficients is illustrated. We extend the study to the ordering behaviour of elongated grains under vertical vibrations. We show that this phenomenon is intrinsic to elongated grains and takes place also in the absence of help from sidewalls. We study the role of particle geometry and vibration acceleration and we provide a novel interpretation in terms of available kinetic energy and relevant potential energy barriers. Building on these results, we study and interpret the shape segregation of rods from spheres. Experiments and simulations fit together nicely. The second food application concerns the flow and <b>dosing</b> from vending <b>machine</b> canisters. Our three dimensional DEM simulation unveils a rich microcosm of particle interactions and provides in particular an unexpected explanation for the decreasing dose mass over time. To make this simulation possible we developed an algorithm to detect the collisions between spherical grains and the helix auger. A dosing experiment using glass beads is successfully compared with a simulation in terms of the evolution of both the surface shape and the dosed mass. Good agreement is reached. Further dosing experiments are performed using a cohesive beverage powder. The effect of the dosing screw design on the flow in the canister is quantified and a dosing coil improving the powder withdrawal across the canister is designed and successfully tested. The quantitative comparisons between experiments and simulations achieved in this work and the insight gained from such simulations show clearly the benefit for the food industry stemming from a coupled use of DEM simulations and experiments...|$|R
40|$|Dosators (and other {{machines}} operating on generally similar principles) {{are widely used}} in the pharmaceutical industry for dosing products that are delivered to the customer in powder form (i. e. capsules and dry inhaled powder applications). However a significant problem for this technology {{is the ability to}} predict how accurately and reliably, new formulations can be <b>dosed</b> from these <b>machines</b> prior to scale-up for manufacture. Dosator filling machines have been on the market for over forty years, and their mechanisms have been refined over the time; in parallel with development work of formulation scientists. Despite the work that has progressed in both of these important fields, there has been only a limited improvement in the understanding of how the formulations behave when introduced into production line equipment. Typical problems include variation in potency and manufacturing dose weight – both being issues that can be difficult to predict and counter (especially where mainly the manufacturing process is undertaken on a batch basis). Many manufacturing problems {{can be traced back to}} an inadequate understanding of the bulk properties of the powders at the formulation stage. Common issues encountered during full scale production include extended commissioning; high levels of out of specification materials (specifically through dose weight variation). The project aims to provide a predictive tool to industry, the use of which can improve manufacturing efficiency, minimise costs and risk when launching new products. The approach proposed focuses on the development of an analytical model for the pick up and discharge of powder into and out of dosators, based upon established particle/powder characterisation techniques combined with an improved understanding of dosator machine factors, constitutive models and geometry of the machine. The model will be used to predict fill dose weights and filling/discharge behaviour of new products in dosator fillings systems; likewise, to investigate what changes in powder flow properties mean to dosator operation. Recommendations for the practical use of flow property measurement techniques in conjunction with the model are also outputs from this project. To simulate the process and (very importantly) validate the model, a dosator single shot testrig was engineered at The Wolfson Centre to measure forces acting on the dosator during the filling stage, the force required to eject the dose and the dose weight. In addition other important aids, such as a dosator demonstrator and an ultimate bearing application of soil mechanics, are key in the understanding of the process and estimate the stress distribution occurring in the stages of the operation. In addition, the development of this research provides a better understanding of the compaction phenomena in dosator operation, and more importantly, critical flow properties and machine settings factors compromising the uniformity of the fill dose weight in production lines using dosator filling machines not mentioned in the literature yet. Although this project has focussed on dosators, the general concept could be applicable to other volumetric powder filling systems...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{radiation}} as a sterilization process is increasing. The well-developed {{technology of the}} radiation sterilization as applied to medical devices has assured the food industry that the process is reliable. Due to the food industry 2 ̆ 7 s possibility of widespread use, it is especially crucial that an appropriate packaging material be chosen so that its integrity is maintained after irradiation. This is because the commercial food packaging process carries products through more rigorous paths and channels than medical supplies. Many polymers used in the medical field show various degrees of degradation after radiation exposure, which can be determined either by visual or physical measurement. This paper studies the mechanical properties of polymeric films after irradiation doses of less than 10. 0 Mrads {{and the extent to}} which this process causes film degradation. In this study, two mechanical properties will be measured: tensile strength and percentage elongation at break. Eight polymeric films commonly used in the food packaging industry are selected as the material samples. These materials will be irradiated with doses of 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 0, and 10. 0 Mrads to determine cause-effect and dose related effect. Data collected for tensile strength and percentage elongation at break for each sample of one type of film before and after irradiation is analyzed and compared with data collected for other samples. Two primary purposes in undertaking this analysis are (1) to determine if the type of film significantly changes or degrades after irradiation, and (2) to study the relationship between the changes in mechanical properties of each film and the radiation doses of 0. 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 0, and 10. 0 Mrads. In the analysis at 0. 05 level of significance, polyethylene film (TD-transverse direction) is the only film which did not significantly change in either tensile strength or percentage elongation at break. The polyester/polyethylene film (MD-machine direction) significantly changed in percentage elongation at break although not in tensile strength. The rest of the film samples -PP, OPP, PETG, Polyester/PE(TD), polyester-MYLAR, PE(MD), PE/Nylon and PS film- exhibited significant changes in both mechanical properties after irradiation with doses of 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 0, and 10. 0 Mrads. In the analysis of the degree of relationship between mechanical properties of each film and radiation doses of less than 10. 0 Mrads [0. 0 (non-irradiated), 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 0, andlO. O Mrads] found in this study can be catagorized into three types: the dose-dependent, the dose-independent, and the weak correlation. Among three film samples which exhibited the 2 ̆ 2 dose-dependent 2 ̆ 2 relationship, only oriented polypropylene(OPP) film was found to have the correlation between mechanical properties (both tensile strength and percentage elongation at break) and radiation doses; both mechanical properties decreased as the dose increased. Polypropylene (PP) was determined to exhibit the same correlation but only between tensile strength and radiation <b>dose.</b> For polyethylene (<b>machine</b> direction only), this correlation was found only for percentage elongation at break and radiation dose. The rest of the film samples were found to have no correlation between either mechanical property and radiation doses such as that indicated above. They are either 2 ̆ 2 dose-independent 2 ̆ 2 or exhibit a weak relationship between the two variables. For example, the polyester-MYLAR film exhibited obvious 2 ̆ 2 dose-independent 2 ̆ 2 characteristics since both mechanical properties increased significantly from 0. 0 to 5. 0 Mrads and then decreased at 7. 0 Mrads. The films which obviously showed a very weak relationship between the mechanical properties and the radiation doses are two films which exhibited no change in mechanical properties after irradiation in the first study [PE(TD-tensile 2 ̆ 6 percentage elongation) and polyester/PE (MD- percentage elongation) ]. The films which exhibited a somewhat weak relationship between the two variables are PS (MD 2 ̆ 6 TD- tensile 2 ̆ 6 percentage elongation) and PE (MD-tensile). These last two films also showed a very small change in the mechanical properties after irradiation although not as small as the films irradiated in the first study...|$|R
40|$|Laparoscopy {{has been}} shown in human {{medicine}} to have a rapid recovery time and less morbidity when compared to open abdominal surgery. It involves the insufflation of carbon dioxide into the peritoneal cavity. This creates a space for the surgeon to work in and manipulate the organs. In the normal abdominal cavity the peritoneal cavity is a potential space obliterated by the serosal contact between all the organs. The insufflation of carbon dioxide turns this potential space into a working space. This allows the introduction of an endoscope, usually through a single port, and then various instruments usually through another port into the peritoneal cavity. Multiple veterinary studies have shown the advantages of laparoscopy to decrease the morbidity of animals post surgery. The visualisation of the organs tends to be enhanced by the increased lighting and magnification provided by the laparoscopic equipment. There are intricate attachments and associations between various abdominal organs that are responsible for maintaining organ position and orientation in the peritoneal cavity. Computed tomography (CT) has been proven in human medicine to show excellent abdominal anatomical resolution. It is the modality of choice to detect free abdominal gas. Logically, if there is a massive insufflation of gas, it would be expected that this will enhance the ability of CT to provide real anatomical likeness to the laparoscopic image. The animals were all subjected to multiple CT scans and the scans were found to be rapid and noninvasive. There was a concern over the amount of radiation that each animal received and this was pre-empted by using a CARE 4 D <b>dose.</b> The CT <b>machine</b> detected the thickness of the part of the animal being scanned and only provided the needed kV and mAs to penetrate and create an image. This was a paediatric human modality. Six beagle dogs were used and all assessed prior to the study to be clinically healthy. An abdominal ultrasound was performed to assess that they had normal abdominal anatomy. All animals had eight scans performed, four pre-insufflation (PrI) and four post-insufflation (PoI). The animals were placed in a ventro-dorsal routine (VDR), a ventro-dorsal Trendelenburg (VDT), a left lateral (LL) and a right lateral (RL) position. The scans were performed using a helical dual slice sliding gantry CT machine, Somatom Emotion (Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany). With the insufflation of carbon dioxide in this study, the attachments and associations change and these were shown {{to play a role in}} the movement of the abdominal organs during the manipulations and how the organs come to lie in the abdominal cavity. It was shown that together with the insufflation of carbon dioxide into the abdomen, a very important factor in the movement of the organs was gravity. In certain organs the effect of gravity was found to be the significant factor when the positioning of the animal was changed, more so than the insufflation of the abdomen when PrI and PoI scans were compared. The effects of gravity during the changes in position and the insufflation of the abdomen were compared using a set number of measurements, of organ size and location. The size and location of the organs was compared to set landmarks in the body such as the sternum and certain vertebra, depending on the organ in question. These measurements were compared between the pre- and post-insufflation scans to evaluate the changes that occurred after insufflation with regards to the movement of certain organs and their exposure for a surgical approach. These measurements gave the data an objective value which could then be analysed statistically to determine any significant changes. The p value was set at < 0. 05 in determining statistical significance using a Kruskal-Wallis one way of variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test. This data was analysed and used to determine the best position to place an animal in order to perform laparoscopic surgery of certain organs. This dissertation showed that the VDR and VDT positions proved much better laparoscopic access to the majority of the parenchymatous organs in the peritoneal cavity than the lateral positions. There were certain organs such as the kidney, the ovaries, the uterine horns and the duodenum that were visualised on CT clear of the rest of the parenchymatous organ mass on the non-dependant part in the respective lateral positions. This indicated that these organs will be easily accessible during laparoscopic surgery in the RL and LL. However no matter what position was used, no position was perfect for every organ of interest, and positions need to be combined for certain procedures. The use of positioning will not remove the need for intra-operative retraction and laparoscopic retractors are an essential part of the surgeon’s arsenal when performing laparoscopic procedures.
