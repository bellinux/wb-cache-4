25|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} and more distinctive features of Serious Editor 2's level editor is that it allows for real-time editing. The level design process for most games often requires the level to be modified in the editor, compiled, saved, and then loaded separately in the game where it can be tested. However, Serious Editor 2 allows for levels to be played and tested within the editor without requiring compilation. While playing the level within the editor, the level designer can directly <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> <b>editing</b> mode, make the desired modifications, and then continue playing, greatly simplifying the final stages of level editing.|$|R

However, they cannot <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> <b>editing</b> mode and they are notified that the bundle is currently edited by another user if they try <b>to</b> <b>edit</b> the bundle. When the editing user finishes {{the work on the}} bundle or closes the browser, the bundle is unlocked in the vault. This is possible as changes to the bundle are only possible on the level of SDOs and SROs which have to be saved separately after they were changed. Other users are now notified that the bundle is not locked anymore. When they activate the editing mode, the bundle is reloaded from the vault to ensure that they are working on the most recent version. They also can reload the bundle manually without switching the mode of action when they do not want <b>to</b> <b>edit</b> anything but still want to analyze the latest version of the STIX bundle.|$|R

40|$|Plain text {{has always}} been the {{predominant}} medium for writing and editing programs for expert users. Text is powerful and flexible, but requires more careful manipulation than structural editors, such as those found in block-based environments. In addition, in textual editors programmers are responsible for managing detailed orthography and layout – when beginners work with text, significant time is spent managing syntax problems, indentation and spacing. Frame-based editing is a new editing paradigm that combines the structural editing of block-based systems with the flexibility and keyboard-focus of text editing. In this paper, we empirically examine how much time and effort is spent by beginners on managing syntax errors and indentation, which can be automatically saved by <b>switching</b> <b>to</b> frame-based <b>editing.</b> The data is obtained using the Blackbox dataset; the results predict a clear advantage of frame-based editing over traditional text editors...|$|R

Others refute this (Daastøl, 2011), since he argued for a German customs union already in 1819, when he established the first German union for industry and trade. In 1827 he published a pamphlet entitled Outlines of American Political Economy, in which he defended the doctrine of pragmatic protection and free trade.

40|$|CRISPR nucleases are {{efficient}} tools <b>to</b> <b>edit</b> cellular genomes in {{a variety}} of organisms. However, the in vivo application of this technology is still severely limited by unwanted genomic cleavages, that are further increased by long-term expression of the nuclease and can lead to unpredictable results. To address this limitation, we developed a yeast-based assay which allows to simultaneously evaluate the on- and off-target activity towards two engineered genomic targets in order to select optimized Streptococcus pyogenes Cas 9 (SpCas 9) variants. The screening of SpCas 9 variants obtained by random mutagenesis of the Rec 1 -II domain allowed the identification of hits with increased on/off ratios. Through the combination of the identified mutations within a single variant we isolated the best performing nuclease, that we named evoCas 9 (evolved Cas 9). Side by side analyses with recently reported rationally designed variants demonstrated a significant improvement in fidelity of our evoCas 9. In addition, to control Cas 9 persistence into cells over time, we developed a Self-Limiting Cas 9 circuitry for Enhanced Safety (SLiCES) which consists of an expression unit for SpCas 9, a self-targeting sgRNA and a second sgRNA targeting a chosen genomic locus. This self-limiting circuit, by controlling Cas 9 levels, results in increased genome editing specificity. For its in vivo utilization, we integrated SLiCES into a lentiviral delivery system (lentiSLiCES) via circuit inhibition to achieve viral particle production. Following its delivery into target cells, the lentiSLiCES circuit is <b>switched</b> on <b>to</b> <b>edit</b> the intended genomic locus while simultaneously promoting its own neutralization through SpCas 9 inactivation. The two strategies here developed represent complementary approaches to address a major issue in the genome editing field. On one hand, by preserving target cells from residual nuclease activity, our hit and go SLiCES system increases the safety margins for genome engineering. On the other, if compared to published structure-guided protein engineering approaches, our in vivo screening increases the likelihood to identify the best combination of amino acid substitutions for the generation of novel, error-free SpCas 9 and could represent a valid strategy to enhance the specificity of other RNA-guided nucleases. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{typical process}} of editing content {{on the web}} is {{strongly}} moded. Authors are forced <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> between <b>editing</b> and previewing and publishing modes before, during, and after the editing process. This thesis explores a new paradigm of editing content on the web called seamless editing. Unlike existing techniques for editing content on the web, seamless editing is modeless, enabling authors <b>to</b> directly <b>edit</b> content on web pages without the need <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> between any modes. The absence of modes reduces the amount of cognitive complexity involved with the editing process. A software framework called Seaweed was developed for providing seamlessly editable web pages in any common web browser, and is shown {{that it can be}} integrated into any content management system. For the purposes of experimentation, the content management system WordPress was selected, and a plugin using the Seaweed framework developed for it that provided a seamlessly editable environment. Two experiments were conducted. The first study observed users with no or minimal experience with using WordPress, following a set of prescribed tasks, both with and without the plugin. The second study was conducted over a longer time period in a real-world context, where existing WordPress users were naturally observed using the plugin within their own blogs. Analysis of logged interactions and pre-questionnaires and post-questionnaires showed that, in both studies, the participants found the Seaweed software to be intuitive and the new way of <b>editing</b> content <b>to</b> be easily adaptable. Additionally, the analysis showed that the participants found the concept of seamless <b>editing</b> <b>to</b> be useful, and could see it being useful in many other contexts, other than blogs...|$|R

40|$|International audienceEuryarchaeal {{polymerase}} B {{can recognize}} deaminated bases on the template strand, effectively stalling the replication fork 4 nt downstream the modified base. Using Pyrococcus abyssi DNA B family polymerase (PabPolB), we investigated the discrimination between deaminated and natural nucleotide(s) by primer extension assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and X-ray crystallography. Structures of complexes between the protein and DNA duplexes {{with either a}} dU or a dH in position + 4 were solved at 2. 3 Å and 2. 9 Å resolution, respectively. The PabPolB {{is found in the}} editing mode. A new metal binding site has been uncovered below the base-checking cavity where the + 4 base is flipped out; it is fully hydrated in an octahedral fashion and helps guide the strongly kinked template strand. Four other crystal structures with each of the canonical bases were also solved in the editing mode, and the presence of three nucleotides in the exonuclease site caused a shift in the coordination state of its metal A from octahedral to tetrahedral. Surprisingly, we find that all canonical bases also enter the base-checking pocket with very small differences in the binding geometry and in the calculated binding free energy compared to deaminated ones. To explain how this can lead to stalling of the replication fork, the full catalytic pathway and its branches must be taken into account, during which the base is checked several times. Our results strongly suggest a <b>switch</b> from elongation <b>to</b> <b>editing</b> modes right after nucleotide insertion when the modified base is at position + 5...|$|R
