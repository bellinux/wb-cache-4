5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and <b>sexual</b> <b>molestation</b> {{did not appear to be}} significant in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women were more likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore whether male {{kindergarten}} teachers perceive additional expectations from their surroundings (such as co-workers and parents). Furthermore, we aim to understand and explain how these expectations are related to gender norms and hierarchies in society, that is social constructions concerning what men and women should do and be like. In addition, the thesis aspire to understand and explain how these constructions relate to more specific social constructions about <b>sexual</b> <b>molestations</b> in kindergarten contexts and explore how these discourses influence male kindergarten teachers in their work including which strategies they use in order to cope with them. How do male kindergarten teachers perceive additional expectations from their surroundings? How do male kindergarten teachers perceive the effects and consequences of the social constructions about <b>sexual</b> <b>molestations</b> in kindergarten contexts? Do they use coping strategies in order {{to attend to the}} expectations projected on them, and if so, what kind of strategies? The thesis is based on a phenomenological approach and conducted through interviews with six male kindergarten teachers. The interviews were directed with an interview guide in hand while allowing for spontaneous input from the interviewee. The use of an interview guide provides for a standardization of the interview, ensuring a good reliability. An argument for a high grade of validity is that the interpretations where made by both of us, thereby preventing misconceptions and false analyses. The thesis concludes that the social constructions about <b>sexual</b> <b>molestations</b> in kindergarten contexts {{can be seen as a}} tool for regulating the violations on society´s conception of what men and women should do and be like. It is clear that the interviewees perceive additional expectations and they do use certain strategies in order to cope with them...|$|R

25|$|Apart {{from the}} 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when {{manpower}} shortages saw many Palmach and IDF women taking {{active part in}} land battles, women were historically barred from battle in the IDF, serving {{in a variety of}} technical and administrative support roles. Soon after the establishment of the IDF, the removal of all women from front-line positions was decreed. Decisive for this decision was the very real possibility of falling into enemy hands as prisoners of war. It was fair and equitable to demand from women equal sacrifice and risk, it was argued, but the risk for women prisoners of rape and <b>sexual</b> <b>molestation</b> was infinitely greater than the same risk for men. A majority of women serving in the IDF then were secretaries. The rest served primarily as instructors, nurses, clerks and telephone operators. A few women flew transport missions in the 1950s and a few women were accepted into flight training in the 1970s, but did not complete the program before it was closed to women.|$|E

The young Sylvester was often accused of effeminacy and recognized his own homosexuality from an early age. At the age of eight, he engaged in sexual activity with a far older man at the church—at the time rumored to be the church organist—although he would always maintain that this was consensual and not an example of <b>sexual</b> <b>molestation.</b> Sylvester was taken to a doctor after receiving injuries during anal sex with this man; it was the doctor who informed Letha that her son was gay, something that she could not accept, viewing homosexual activity as a perversion and a sin. News of Sylvester's homosexual activity soon spread through the church congregation, and feeling unwelcome, he ceased his attendance at age 13.|$|E

5000|$|According to police, Sela {{committed}} {{at least}} 24 and possibly {{as many as}} 34 rapes, sexual assaults, and <b>sexual</b> <b>molestations</b> of women and girls {{over the course of}} five years.

Sela forced his victims to shower afterward to reduce physical evidence, and threatened to kill them if they left the shower before half an hour had passed. To avoid identification, he would attack and then rape his victims from behind, ensuring that they would only get glimpses of him. In three instances, he videotaped his victims and threatened to publish the tape on the internet or give it to their friends if they reported the crime. Sela's crimes gained notoriety, and he became known as the [...] "Tel Aviv rapist".

2500|$|As {{well as his}} {{pressure}} technique, Freud's clinical procedures involved analytic inference and {{the symbolic}} interpretation of symptoms to trace back to memories of infantile sexual abuse. His claim of one hundred percent confirmation of his theory only served to reinforce previously expressed reservations from his colleagues {{about the validity of}} findings obtained through his suggestive techniques. Freud subsequently showed inconsistency as to whether his seduction theory was still compatible with his later findings. In an addendum to The Aetiology of Hysteria he stated: [...] "All this is true but it must be remembered that at the time I wrote it I had not yet freed myself from my overvaluation of reality and my low valuation of phantasy". Some years later Freud explicitly rejected the claim of his colleague Ferenczi that his patients’ reports of <b>sexual</b> <b>molestation</b> were actual memories instead of fantasies, and he tried to dissuade Ferenczi from making his views public. Karin Ahbel-Rappe concludes in her study [...] "'I no longer believe': did Freud abandon the seduction theory?’’: [...] "Freud marked out and started down a trail of investigation into the nature of the experience of infantile incest {{and its impact on the}} human psyche, and then abandoned this direction for the most part." ...|$|E
