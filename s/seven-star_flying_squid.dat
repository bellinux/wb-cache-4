5000|$|The neon <b>flying</b> <b>squid</b> (Ommastrephes bartramii), {{sometimes}} called the red <b>flying</b> <b>squid,</b> akaika, and red squid is a species of large <b>flying</b> <b>squid</b> in the family Ommastrephidae. They are found in subtropical and temperate oceanic waters globally.|$|R

Ommastrephinae and Todarodinae are two subfamilies of squids under the family of Ommastrephidae. They utilize jet propulsion {{to jump out of}} water as they do underwater, including Japanese <b>flying</b> <b>squid..,</b> Humboldt <b>squid,</b> Neon <b>flying</b> <b>squid,</b> sevenstar <b>flying</b> <b>squid,</b> and Wellington <b>flying</b> <b>squid.</b> Squid flight may be thought to reduce the cost of migration. The acceleration of Sthenoteuthis pteropus in air is 265 body lengths/s2 (24.5 m/s2), which is found to exceed that in water (79 body lengths/s2).|$|R

40|$|Data {{collected}} from an exploratory cruise {{to the eastern}} North Pacific were analyzed to describe the abundance and distributional pattern of the neon <b>flying</b> <b>squid,</b> Ommastrephes bartramii. In total 15 806 kg of the neon <b>flying</b> <b>squid</b> {{was caught in a}} 45 -d period, with an average of 351. 2 kg d- 1. The isopleth diagram of catch per unit effort (CPUE) was used as an index of the abundance, and a significant higher abundance was found around 44 ° N, 164 ° W. Water mass characteristics was distinctive in the study area. It is apparent that the high abundance of the squid was linked to relatively low water temperature and low salin-ity. Principal component analysis indicated that water temperature has higher predictive power than salinity to estimate the abundance of neon <b>flying</b> <b>squid.</b> A latitudinal effect on the abundance of squid was confirmed; however no sign of a longitudinal trend was found, i. e., significant high abundance was found patchily.

5000|$|Some {{aquatic animals}} also {{regularly}} use gliding, for example, flying fish, octopus and squid. The flights of flying fish are typically around 50 meters (160 ft), though {{they can use}} updrafts {{at the leading edge}} of waves to cover distances of up to 400 m. [...] To glide upward out of the water, a flying fish moves its tail up to 70 times per second.Several oceanic squid, such as the Pacific <b>flying</b> <b>squid,</b> leap out of the water to escape predators, an adaptation similar to that of <b>flying</b> fish.
