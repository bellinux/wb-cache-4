30|$|While speech {{intelligibility}} and speech quality are linked, work by Voiers [38] showed that an amplitude-distorted signal {{that had been}} peak clipped did not impact intelligibility but seriously affected the quality.

In evaluating the {{speech intelligibility}} provided by two hearing aid algorithms with NSIM, {{it was noted that}} while the intelligibility level was the same for both, the NSIM predicted higher levels of similarity for one algorithm over the other [39].

30|$|Mud channel signals {{experience}} pressure fluctuations {{and uncertainty}} caused by various MPT system components that potentially change signal properties {{during the course}} of data transmission. The main noise sources that induce pressure fluctuations are mud pumps, pulsation dampeners, surface piping, pressure transducer locations, drill string components, mud properties and the well depth (Klotz et al. 2008 a, c). The mud channel that the pulse signals pass as they propagate to the surface is extremely harsh, demanding complex surface signal detection and extraction. Common mud pulse signal property distortions which degrade signal transmission and data rates are downhole signal strength, signal attenuation, surface induced noise (electrical noise) and surface piping induced signal reflections (Klotz et al. 2008 c). Unpredictable and complex adjustable <b>signal</b> <b>impairments</b> are caused by drilling noise, drill string motion noise within the borehole, attenuation and circulation pumps noise (Shearer 2010). Depending on the severity of the mud channel conditions and signal distortions, to achieve maximum possible data rates, telemetry systems must be robust and flexible, both downhole and at the surface receiver (Klotz et al. 2008 a, b, c).

On the other hand, the performance of the MAX-LOG-MAP based serial turbo with decoders with talwar penalty function exhibit complete independence with respect to errors in the variance estimate in impulsive channel. The study also found that using talwar penalty function can significantly improve decoding capabilities of SCCC in impulse noise channel under varying channel variance environment.

Besides normal movement and <b>signal</b> <b>impairment</b> difficulties, those multimedia applications may impose extra end-to-end requirements. The computation of optimized and/or constrained network paths using one or more metric restrictions is called QoS (Quality-of-Service) routing. This paper presents QMRS, a QoS routing protocol for Ad-Hoc networks which aims to support applications with QoS requirements including requirements for the end-to-end delay. This protocol proposes a on-demand multiple routes discovery mechanism that is able to find up to three node-disjoint paths that meet the QoS requirement. Additionally, and {{for the purpose of}} guarantee the stability of the routing process, it uses the signal strength of the links between neighbouring nodes to elect the most stable route.

To meet these demands, world-wide research efforts for optical communications have led to tremendous growth in performance in the past few decades. Nowadays, optical communication systems find applications in various scenarios, ranging from backbone networks to data centers. In recent years, coherent communication systems in fiber-optical channels have attracted interest in the academic and industrial communities. Coherent optical systems enable the encoding of information in both the amplitude and phase of the signal, which can result in improved performance with respect to spectral and power efficiency. Furthermore, advances in the electronic hardware have facilitated effective <b>signal</b> <b>impairment</b> compensation using digital signal processing, allowing the adoption of algorithms from wireless communications. A particular impairment is laser phase noise, which can severely limit the gains promised by coherent optical systems. In this thesis the problem of optimal symbol detection in the presence of laser phase noise in uncoded optical communication systems is studied. We assume a single carrier transmission on two independent polarizations in a channel that includes phase noise, additive white Gaussian noise, and a random constant phase offset on each polarization component. To this end, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) symbol detector is presented, which is shown to be analytically intractable.
