5|$|Back at {{the house}} her odd {{behaviour}} continued; most notably she offered the men cigarettes, only to quickly snatch {{them out of their}} mouths as the men smoked them, claiming the cigarettes to be poisoned. She was also carrying multiple mobile phones, as well as a laptop. <b>She</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be paranoid and constantly looked out of the windows; this behaviour caused Molloy to assume that she had run away from an abusive partner. Shortly before midnight Molloy left the two, and Sabina stayed the night in Hollinshead's home.|$|E
5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E

25|$|Menken {{wanted to}} perform the stunt herself. Dressed in nude tights and riding a horse on stage, <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be naked and caused a sensation. New York audiences were shocked but still {{attended}} and made the play popular.|$|E
25|$|After The Dance, McVie {{returned}} to England {{to be near}} her family and stayed out of public view until 2000 when <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> accept an Honorary Doctorate in music from the University of Greenwich. Sometime after leaving Fleetwood Mac, she and Quintela divorced.|$|E
50|$|Late in 1926, <b>she</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> {{have been}} {{temporarily}} {{assigned to the}} American naval forces operating in Europe. By 1 January 1927, her base of operations had been moved from Newport, to Norfolk, Virginia.

25|$|Hayworth {{resented the}} fact that the studio had failed to train her to sing or even to {{encourage}} her to learn how to sing. Although <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> sing in many of her films, she was usually dubbed. Because the public did not know her secret, she was embarrassed to be asked to sing by troops at USO shows.|$|E
25|$|On 3 August 2005, the BBC {{reported}} that she was critically ill at King's College Hospital in London. <b>She</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> have suffered from balance problems {{as a result of}} her radiotherapy. According to her husband, she had fallen over on 30 July 2005, receiving head injuries and never regaining consciousness. Her living will, in which she had asked not to be resuscitated, was honoured.|$|E
25|$|On November 5, 2009, {{the first}} and second of the eleven victims were {{identified}}.

25|$|Hewitt {{was one of}} the MPs {{named in}} the 2010 sting {{operation}} into political lobbying by the Channel 4 Dispatches programme, in which <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> claim that she was paid £3,000 a day to help a client obtain a key seat on a Government advisory group. On 22 March 2010, Hewitt, along with Geoff Hoon and Stephen Byers were suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party over the allegations.|$|E
25|$|At the Olympics, {{where she}} once again faced Soviet opposition, Čáslavská {{continued}} to subtly voice her views. After <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> {{have won the}} gold medal on floor outright, the judging panel curiously upgraded the preliminary scores of Soviet Larisa Petrik, and declared a tie for the gold instead. All of this occurred on the heels of another very controversial judging decision that cost Čáslavská the gold on beam, instead awarding the title to Soviet rival Natalia Kuchinskaya. Clearly disheartened and angered by the politics that favored the USSR, she protested during both medal ceremonies by quietly turning her head down and away during the playing of the Soviet national anthem.|$|E
25|$|Paris {{returned}} to commercial service and in December rescued 22 of 23 seaman aboard the British Vindobala before the tanker sank during a bad winter storm. While westbound on 2 May 1899, Paris ran aground {{in the fog}} on the Manacles off of the coast of Cornwall. At first, <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be a total loss and was not refloated for two months. After she was pulled from the rocks, the badly damaged ship was rebuilt at Belfast, Ireland, receiving new engines and having her triple smokestacks replaced {{by a pair of}} taller ones. Renamed Philadelphia, she finally resumed North Atlantic passenger service in August 1901.|$|E

25|$|After an {{impressive}} 2002 season, O'Sullivan had a disappointing 2003. She started {{well with a}} win at the newly inaugurated Great Ireland Run, but she struggled during the summer Grand Prix races. However, <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be finding her form {{at the right time}} when she ran a season's best in the 3000 m in Zurich in a time of 8:37.55 on 15 August. At the World Championships in Paris later that month she was considered a possible medalist. She qualified very comfortably from her heat. However, in the final she finished last of the 15 starters. In December she finished {{an impressive}} fourth at the European Cross-Country Championships, and lead Ireland to silver in the team event.|$|E
25|$|Isabella {{played an}} {{important}} role in Mantua during the city's troubled times. When her husband was captured in 1509 and held hostage in Venice, she took control of Mantua's military forces and held off their invaders until his release in 1512. In the same year, 1512, she was the hostess at the Congress of Mantua, which was held to settle questions concerning Florence and Milan. As a ruler, <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> have been much more assertive and competent than her husband. When apprised of this fact upon his return, Francesco was furious and humiliated at being upstaged by his wife's superior political ability. This caused their marriage to break down irrevocably. As a result, Isabella began to travel freely and live independently from her husband until his death on 19 March 1519.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists Jack Block and Jeanne Block {{evaluated}} Genie in February 1971 and put {{her language}} below the two-year-old level on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. During the next month her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her active vocabulary at over 100 words. Doctors noted that she seemed to know far more words than she would spontaneously say, but {{could not be sure}} about the extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary because she was so responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly complex sentences. Soon after <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.|$|E

25|$|In March 2008, a 9-1-1 {{call was}} made by someone {{who claimed to be}} Locklear's doctor, who said that Locklear was trying to commit suicide. Emergency {{responders}} were dispatched to Locklear's home. Her publicist later said that Locklear had never requested any medical assistance and the Ventura County Sheriff's Department later stated that no further action was taken once they arrived at Locklear's Westlake Village home, as <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be fine. They did, however, state that they believed the call to be genuine. On June 24, 2008, she checked into a medical facility in Arizona for psychological ailments including anxiety and depression, and requested an in-depth evaluation of her medication to receive proper diagnosis and treatment. Her agent confirmed that she was suffering from anxiety and depression. On July 23, 2008, Locklear returned home after four weeks of treatment at the facility.|$|E
25|$|As {{it could}} be expected, when they arrived on 13 August, Marie was disillusioned. The house, {{contained}} within {{the ruins of a}} former monastery, was in disrepair, damp and rat-infested. Her in-laws were peasants who disgusted her and regarded her with deep distrust. Instead of the wealth she expected, she was faced with considerable debt. In her despondency, she locked herself in her room the first night and wrote a letter to her husband, imploring him to release her from their marriage, while threatening to take her life with arsenic. Lafarge, whose affairs were desperate, agreed to make concessions except to release her from the marriage. He promised not to assert his marital privileges until he restored the estate to its original condition. <b>She</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> calm down, and their relationship appeared to have improved in the ensuing weeks.|$|E
500|$|Authorities {{originally}} {{estimated that}} the girl had died within days of her discovery. Later developments in the case have suggested that Bella's body had been [...] "hidden in a fridge" [...] {{for as long as}} one month before it was deposited on Deer Island. Despite the fact that <b>she</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> be deceased a short amount of time, she had already begun to decompose and become bloated, and so was impossible to identify visually. Decomposition had also made it impossible to collect fingerprints, due to exposure to the water. Investigators were able to conclude that she was a young child but were initially unsure of her race and ethnicity.|$|E
