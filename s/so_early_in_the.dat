Niemann, and Townsend were all {{selected}} along with Humber in the first eight picks of the 2004 MLB Draft— the first time three teammates had ever gone <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same draft.

5|$|On September 15, Obama {{attended}} a Philadelphia fundraising dinner for Specter, an unusually public {{declaration of support}} <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary season, when the President has the option of remaining neutral until the final outcome becomes clearer. Governor Rendell said that Obama and Biden felt obligated to strongly support Specter because they so strongly lobbied him to switch parties. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and radio personality Michael Smerconish also spoke on Specter's behalf. Senate Majority Leader Reid took the unusual steps of scheduling no Senate votes that day so both Specter and Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, Jr. could attend the fundraiser. That move drew criticism from Republicans, {{as well as from}} Sestak, who felt Specter was skirting his Senate responsibilities, yet hypocritically criticizing Sestak at the same time for missing more than 100 votes in the U.S. House. The event was expected to raise about $2.5 million, which was to be split between Specter's campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. After the fundraiser, Obama and Specter traveled via Air Force One to Pittsburgh to address labor activists at the AFL-CIO convention. There, Specter assured the audience he would support the Employee Free Choice Act, a proposed bill that would make union formation easier, which Specter had previously opposed as a Republican.|$|E

25|$|The Texans {{ended up}} having to wait until Week 5 against the Indianapolis Colts to have their home opener, the latest an NFL team went into the season before playing at home since the New Orleans Saints played their entire {{schedule}} {{on the road in}} 2005 due to the damages of the city of New Orleans as a result of Hurricane Katrina. (Every other NFL team had at least one home game by the end of Week 2.) With the Ravens eventually advancing to the AFC Championship Game against the rival Pittsburgh Steelers (and having to enter the playoffs as a wild card team), the impromptu decision to give the Ravens and Texans their bye week <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season {{ended up having}} the unintended effect of the Ravens playing in an NFL-record 18 consecutive weeks without a break in the schedule.|$|E
25|$|Rockford and {{surrounding}} areas {{are prone to}} violent thunderstorms during the months of March, April, May, and June. On April 21, 1967, the neighboring town of Belvidere {{was struck by a}} violent F4 tornado, in which twenty-four people were killed and hundreds more injured at Belvidere's High School. Other severe weather events, such as hail and strong winds are common in these storms. On July 5, 2003 at 04:13, supercells produced tornadoes causing widespread damage on both the east and west sides of Rockford. Approximately 70,000 people were without power, with many on the west side suffering in the heat without electricity for a week. It took months for the damage to be completely cleared, but because the storm struck <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning there were no injuries or fatalities. However, these sometimes violent storms bring the majority of summer rainfall.|$|E

25|$|This {{division}} into ecclesiastical provinces did {{not develop}} <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western Empire. In North Africa the first metropolitan appears {{during the fourth}} century, the Bishop of Carthage being recognized as primate of the dioceses of Northern Africa; metropolitans of the separate provinces gradually appear, although the boundaries of these provinces did not coincide with the divisions of the empire. A similar development was witnessed in Spain, Gaul, and Italy. The migration of the nations, however, prevented an equally stable formation of ecclesiastical provinces in the Christian West as in the East. It was only after the fifth century that such gradually developed, mostly {{in accordance with the}} ancient divisions of the Roman Empire. In Italy alone, on account of the central ecclesiastical position of Rome, this development was slower. However, at the end of Antiquity the existence of church provinces as the basis of ecclesiastical administration was fairly universal in the West. In the Carolingian period they were reorganized, and have retained their place ever since.|$|E

On a list ranking all the Lost episodes (except the finale), the Los Angeles Times ranked [...] "House of the Rising Sun" [...] 44 out of 110 episodes, explaining: [...] "Cutesy title aside, this first look into the Sun and Jin marriage proved the show was willing to try {{all kinds of different}} stories to be a success."

500|$|... "Night of the Dead Living" [...] was {{directed}} by Michael Lehmann. The teleplay was written by Frank Pugliese based on a story he wrote along with executive director Tom Fontana. It was originally intended to be the third episode of the , but NBC programmers felt it was too slow-paced to run <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season. The episode takes place entirely within the squad room and lacks the traditional action of a typical police series, which NBC executives felt was not appropriate for an early stage when the series {{was still trying to}} woo viewers. The programmers also preferred to end the series on the upbeat note of the final scenes in [...] "Night of the Dead Living", which includes the detectives happily smiling and laughing {{on the roof of the}} police department building as Gee sprays them with a hose to relieve the summer heat. In contrast, the originally-planned season finale, [...] "", which Homicide producers felt had a sense of resolving season storylines, was a somber episode which ended with a sad image of Bolander quietly singing to himself at a bar over a beer.|$|E
500|$|Keith DeCandido re-watched {{the episode}} for Tor.com in June 2012, {{saying that it}} was a solid episode and that Patrick Stewart did [...] "a stellar job, {{modulating}} from pained to confused to nostalgic to frustrated to crazy, all quite convincingly." [...] He said that the downside of the episode was that Troi and Wesley Crusher were not well used, while the revelation of the orb <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode prevented any suspense being built up. He said that the episode worked because it concentrated on Picard, and gave it a score of six out of ten. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] gave the episode two and a half out of four, {{saying that it was}} slow-paced but that the storyline had a [...] "psychological component that's sometimes effective". Cast member Wil Wheaton watched [...] "The Battle" [...] for AOL TV in February 2007. He felt that the plot had similar themes to , in that a father sought revenge following the death of his son. He thought that the writing was weak overall, and that the episode purely worked because of the ability of Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard.|$|E

500|$|... "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} the first-season finale, while [...] "Night of the Dead Living" [...] was meant to be the third episode. However, NBC programmers felt it was too slow-paced to run <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season: the episode takes place entirely within the squad room and lacked traditional police drama action, which NBC executives felt was not appropriate for an early stage when the series was still trying to woo viewers. As a result, [...] "Night of the Dead Living" [...] was shown out of sequence and made the season finale. This created several notable continuity errors. For example, Officer Chris Thormann has not yet been shot and blinded in [...] "Night of the Dead Living", and Tim Bayliss is still working on the Adena Watson case, which was already ended earlier in the season. These errors were addressed by Homicide producers by adding the words [...] "One hot night, last September..."

About the film's 3D effects, Goldman said [...] "The 3D is used {{as you might expect}} it to be – which is to say, this is no James Cameron immersive experience.

[...] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review. He said Saw 3D is [...] "consistent both stylistically and thematically with previous editions", but said most of the film's traps lack the [...] "Rube Goldberg-style cleverness that marked the series".
