For some SE subgroups, {{it is unclear}} how the risk of an aggressive therapeutic approach balances with outcome improvement. We recently developed a prognostic score (Status Epilepticus Severity Score, <b>STESS),</b> relying on four outcome predictors (age, history of seizures, seizure type and extent of consciousness impairment), determined before treatment institution. Our aim was to assess whether the score might have a role in the treatment strategy choice. This cohort study involved adult patients in three centers. For each patient, the <b>STESS</b> was calculated before primary outcome assessment: survival vs. death at discharge. Its ability to predict survival was estimated through the negative predictive value for mortality (NPV). Stratified odds ratios (OR) for mortality were calculated considering coma induction as exposure; strata were defined by the <b>STESS</b> level. In the observed 154 patients, the <b>STESS</b> had an excellent negative predictive value (0. 97). A favorable <b>STESS</b> was highly related to survival (P < 0. 001), and to return to baseline clinical condition in survivors (P < 0. 001). The combined Mantel-Haenszel OR for mortality in patients stratified after coma induction and their <b>STESS</b> was 1. 5 (95 % CI: 0. 59 - 3. 83). The <b>STESS</b> reliably identifies SE patients who will survive. Early aggressive treatment could not be routinely warranted in patients with a favorable <b>STESS,</b> who will almost certainly survive their SE episode.

In this thesis I ask the {{question}} whether Madonna challenges popularcultures general definition of "the feminine". The discussion is based on three analyses of some of Madonnas most famous videos, Like a Virgin from 1984, Express Yourself from 1989 and Vouge from 1990. Sentral to my discussion is the way Madonna deliberately "acts out" several stereotypical gender-roles and cliches in a way that exposes the cultural constructedness of these well known stereotypes. The analyses will also show that Madonna redifines the traditional genderhierarchy and subject/object positions that still dominates much of popular culture. Further, this thesis will discuss the the fact that Madonna is firmly rooted in the musicvideo-genre and that this clearly makes Madonna a part of a postmodern aestetics. This is a paradigm that has had a lot of influence on the way she expresses herself artisticly.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundStatus epilepticus (SE) is a {{frequent}} neurological emergency complicated by high mortality and often poor functional outcome in survivors. The {{aim of this study}} was to review available clinical scores to predict outcome. MethodsLiterature review. PubMed Search terms were “score”, “outcome”, and “status epilepticus” (April 9 th 2015). Publications with abstracts available in English, no other language restrictions, or any restrictions concerning investigated patients were included. ResultsTwo scores were identified: “Status Epilepticus Severity Score — STESS” and “Epidemiology based Mortality score in SE — EMSE”. A comprehensive comparison of test parameters concerning performance, options, and limitations was performed. Epidemiology based Mortality score in SE allows detailed individualization of risk factors and is significantly superior to <b>STESS</b> in a retrospective explorative study. In particular, EMSE is very good at detection of good and bad outcome, whereas <b>STESS</b> detecting bad outcome is limited by a ceiling effect and uncertainty of correct cutoff value. Epidemiology based Mortality score in SE can be adapted to different regions in the world and to advances in medicine, as new data emerge. In addition, we designed a reporting standard for status epilepticus to enhance acquisition and communication of outcome relevant data. A data acquisition sheet used from patient admission in emergency room, from the EEG lab to intensive care unit, is provided for optimized data collection. ConclusionStatus Epilepticus Severity Score is easy to perform and predicts bad outcome, but has a low predictive value for good outcomes. Epidemiology based Mortality score in SE is superior to <b>STESS</b> in predicting good or bad outcome but needs marginally more time to perform. Epidemiology based Mortality score in SE may prove very useful for risk stratification in interventional studies and is recommended for individual outcome prediction. Prospective validation in different cohorts is needed for EMSE, whereas <b>STESS</b> needs further validation in cohorts with a wider range of etiologies.

40|$|Current {{interruption}} in vacuum {{is characterized}} by a very rapid transition from an almost perfectly conducting arc plasma state to a very good insulating state. During the transition, the recovery process determines the success of the interruption. The aim of this contribution is to derive characteristics from measurements of the initial (2 ̆ 2 current zero 2 ̆ 2) stage of this recovery process, having the potential to indicate the quality of the interruption. In the case of vacuum, a large number of measurements has been performed giving detailed information on the recovery process during the decay period of the post-arc plasma. The best-known indicator is the post-arc current, drawn from the decaying residual plasma by the transient recovery voltage. It turned out from measurement statistics, that post-arc current quantities (duration, peak value, charge) alone are not suitable as performance indicators. In addition, the role of conductivity (evolution) is examined, also showing not a very strong relationship with performance. It must be concluded that current-zero performance indicators for vacuum interruption are more difficult to define than for SF 6 interruption. This suggests that vacuum interruption success is strongly related to di-electrical <b>stesses,</b> that are still relatively mild in the current zero period of a few microseconds duration...|$|R
40|$|A unified {{model is}} {{formulated}} to interpret quantitatively the observed {{characteristics of the}} nuclear train, the two dust trails, and the tail region of P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 {{in terms of a}} collisionally modified rotation velocity distribution of the comet's debris. Since there is no evidence for the comet's out-gassing, the model does not assume activity. The discruption of the parent comet was due primarily to tidal <b>stesses</b> during its extremely close approach to Juptier in July 1992. The original nucleus is found to have been most probably approximately 5 km in radius or, equivalently, approximately 10 (exp 17) g in mass. The dynamical separation of the debris occurred apparently approximately 2. 2 hr after the perijove passage, even though the actual fragmentation of the original mass is likely to have begun before closest approach. Physical breakp was accompanied by ubiquitous low-velocity collisions among the particulates, resulting in a rearrangement of the initial rotaional velocities into a rapidly 'thermalized' distribution, characterized by a long tail of relatively high velocities for the debris that populates the dust trails far from the nuclear train. Compelling evidence is presented for secondary fragmentation events, indicative of the comet's continuing disintegration. Secondary fragmentation may be caused by rotational bursting of the massive fragments that had been cracked but unbroken during the tidal disruption. Impact conditions and possible interactions of the comet's debris with the jovian system during the encounter in July 1994 are described...|$|R

BACKGROUND: SE is a neurological emergency with significant mortality and morbidity. There is currently limited data regarding {{the causes and}} outcomes of SE in our locality. DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively studied the clinical characteristics, clinical outcome of adults diagnosed with convulsive SE and managed at a regional hospital in Hong Kong during January 1 st 2007 – December 31 st 2011. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients with convulsive SE were identified during the study period. The mean age was 58 years (range 21 - 92 years) and 61 % were males. Underlying cerebrovascular disease (34 %), poor compliance to anti-convulsants in patients with known epilepsy (16 %) and infection of {{the central nervous system}} (11 %) were the main causes of convulsive SE. SE was associated with 21 % mortality during hospitalization period and 32 % mortality within 6 -months of admission. Age 65 years, prior history of seizures, a higher blood glucose level during SE and a Status Epilepticus Severity Score (<b>STESS)</b> 4 were associated with 6 -month mortality (p< 0. 05). Multi-variate analysis subsequently identified a <b>STESS</b> 4 as an independent predictor of poor prognosis (p= 0. 03).

40|$|A {{traditional}} approach to increasing fatigue resistance of many assemblies involves {{the creation of}} regions of compressive residual stress. For example, riveting holes used in modern passenger aircraft are currently subjected to cold expansion using split mandrel tools. The method is relatively expensive and not entirely problem-free. In the present study we consider a method of creating residual stresses around drilled holes referred to as 'dimpling', that itself is a variation of a novel technique known as the StressWave™ process. An experimental procedure is described {{for the creation of}} localised regions of significant plastic deformation and residual stress by 'dimpling', allowing the production of cold-worked and residually-stressed specimens. The overall aims of this study were to determine thickness-average residual <b>stesses</b> by two different techniques, namely, one destructive technique (Sachs boring) and one non-destructive (high energy X-ray diffraction); and to compare the results. In Sachs boring experiments the variation of strain gauge readings with increasing diameter of the central hole was recorded. A classical elastic-ideally plastic axisymmetric model for plane stress conditions was used in the analysis. Energy dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments were performed for non-destructive assessment of residual elastic strains. The two different stress evaluation techniques used in this project led to consistent results. Good correlation was found between the stresses obtained from X-ray diffraction results and those deduced from Sachs boring experiments.

The HDR-configuration which was not designed for seismic loads withstood a 200 % SSE load without any damage or global residual deformation. - The Energy Absorbers behaved in all aspects as expected. The replacement of 6 snubbers by only 3 Energy Absorbers was sufficient to keep pipe stresses within the limits. - The replacement of all snubbers by Seismic Stops kept the pipe stresses within the allowable limits. - The stiff NRC-configuration was tested up to 8 times the design loads. In the 600 % SSE test 3 snubbers failed. They were not replaced for the 800 % SSE tests, during which another snubber failed from o verloading. Nevertheless, the pipe was not damaged and showed no global plastic deformation. - The flexible support configuration designed by Siemens/KWU could be exposed to 8 times the design loads without any problems. - In the highest stressed points of the pipe strain ranges of 1. 5 % were measured and residual strains accumulated to 1. 2 %. - Seismic margins of rigid struts are clearly greater than the expected factor of 3 to 4.

40|$|The {{article was}} {{prepared}} within the research scheme {{on the subject}} II. 10 of the crucial problem 11. 9. The subject {{is concerned with the}} protection of family in international law. The international protection of marriage is one of its elements. Numerous international acts (the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) contain provisions from which it results that founding a family follows a conclusion of matrimony. It is emphasised in the article that international law provisions are not limited to the protection of institutionalized family but is also concerned with the natural family. A variety of problems to discuss, which are difficult to settle is related to the issue of marriage protection. One could only mention here religious marriages or a polygamous marriage. Neither in internal nor in international law there exists an exhaustive, explicit and juridically correct definition of family and marriage. The notion of marriage can be therefore reconstructed {{on the grounds of the}} provisions related to the rights and obligations of spouses and to conclusion, durability, nullity and cessation of marriage. It follows that marriage is a permanent legal relation linking two persons of a different sex who have concluded a legal transaction known as a conclusion of matrimony, on the basis on family law binding on a given territory, in order to realize social tasks of a family established in that manner. Next, the author presents the development of international norms concerning the protection of marriage, indicating the fact that the protection of married woman's rights was at its origins. The international practice related to marriage <b>stesses</b> strongly the principle of equal rights of a husband and wife. The most elaborated shape was given to that principle in the declaration and convention on abolishing discrimination of women (1967 and 1979). A notice contained in art. 6 of the Declaration might be of some interest in this context, it results from it that the equality should not prejudice the unity of marriage. Another important problem regulated in multilateral agreements is the citizenship of married women. International law favors the conception of the autonomous citizenship of a woman. A husband is thus loosing his leading position in the union. Yet, the marriage should not be grounded on a dominating position of one of the sides. At the end of the article the author discusses the crucial legal questions pertaining conclusion and recognition of matrimony in the light of international law.

40|$|From {{pharmaceutical}} powders {{to agricultural}} grains, a great {{proportion of the}} materials handled in industrial situations are granular or particulate in nature. The variety of <b>stesses</b> that the matierals may experience and the resulting bulk behaviours may be complex. In agricultural engineering, a better understanding into agricultural processes such as seeding, harvesting, transporting and storing will help to improve the handling of agricultural grains with optimised solutions. A detailed understanding of a granular system is crucial when attempting to model a system, whether it is on a micro (particle) or macro (bulk) scale. As numerical capabilities are ever increasing, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is becoming an increasingly popular numerical technique for computing the behaviour of discrete particels for both industrial and scientific applications. A look into the literature shows a lack of validation of what DEM can predict, specifically with respect to bulk behaviour. In addition, when validation studies are conducted, discrepancies between bulk responses in physical tests and numerical predictions using measured particles properties may arise. The aire {{of this research is}} to develop a methodology to calibrate DEM models for agricultural grains using data meaured in bulk physical tests. The methodology will have a wider application to granular solids in general and will advance understanding in the area of DEM model calibration. A contrasting set of granular materials were used to develop the methodology including 3 inorganic solids (single and paired glass beads, and polyethylene terephthalate pellets) and two organic materials (black eyes beans and black kidney beans). The developed methodology consists of three steps: 1. The development of bulk physical tests to measure the bulk responses that will be used to calibrate the DEM models, 2. The creation of the numerical dataset that will describe how the DEM input parameters influence the bulk responses, and 3. The optimisation of the DEM parameters using a searching algorithm and the results from Step 1 and 2. Two laboratory devices were developed to provide calibration data for the proposed methodology: a rotating drum and an confined compression test. These devices were chosen as they can produce bulk responses that are repeatable and easy to quantify, as well as generate discriminating results in numerical simulations when DEM parameters are varied. The bulk response determined from the rotating drum device was the dynamic angle of repose Ør formed when the granular material in a 40 % filled drum is rotating at a speed of 7 rpm. the confined compression apparatus was used to determine the bulk stiffness of a system by monitoring the change in void ratio from the stress applied during a loading and unloading cycle. The gradient of the loading and unloadng curves termed λ and κ respectively were chosen as the bulk responses to calibrate the DEM models. The experimental results revealed that the dynamic Ør was significantly influences by the particle aspect ration and boundary conditions. The stiffness parameters were found to be predominantly influences by the initial packing arrangement. The numerical dataset describing how the DEM input parameters influence the numerical bulk responses was created by simulating the bulk physical tests, varying selected DEM parameters and monitoring the effects on bulk parameters. To limit the number of simulations required, design of experiment (DOE) methods were used to determine a reduced factorial matrix of simulations. In additions, an extensive parametric investigation on the non-optimised parameters as well as a scaling sensitivity study was carried out. The final step in determining the optimised parameters is to use a searching algorithm to infer the DEM parameters based on the numerical dataset and used the experimental results as calibration data. To perform a comparative study, tow searching algorithms were explored: the first was a simple method based on Microsoft Excel's Solver algorithm coupled with a weighted inverse distance method. The second made used of the statistical analysis program Statistica. It was shown that the Excel Solver algorithm is simpler and quicker to use but for the present first implementation, could only perform an optimisation based on two bulk responses. Statistica required the creation of a staistical model based on the numerical dataset before using the profiling and desirability searching technique, but was able to optimise the parameter using all three bulk responses. A verification and validation of the optimisation methodology was conducted using the optimised parameters for the black eyed beans. A verification was cnducted by simulating the two calibration experiments using the optimsed parameters and comparing these with the experiments. In addition, a validation was peformed by predicting the response of ta shallow footing penetration on a bed of black eyed beans. It was found that DEM simulations using optimised parameters predicted vertical stress on the footing during penetration to an acceptable degree of accuracy for industrial applications (< 10 %) at penetration depths up to 30 mm.

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} differences of clinical, treatment and outcome characteristics between patients with in-hospital and out-of-hospital status epilepticus (SE).; From 2005 to 2014, clinical data were assessed in adults with SE treated in an academic medical care centre. Clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes were compared between patients with in-hospital and out-of-hospital SE.; Amongst 352 patients, 213 were admitted with SE and 139 developed in-hospital SE. Patients with in-hospital SE had more acute/fatal aetiologies (60 % vs. 35 %, P < 0. 001), fewer previous seizures (33 % vs. 50 %, P = 0. 002), a higher median Charlson Comorbidity Index (3 vs. 2, P < 0. 001), longer median SE duration (1 vs. 0. 5 days, P = 0. 001), more refractory SE (52 % vs. 39 %, P = 0. 022), less return to functional baseline (38 % vs. 54 %, P = 0. 006) and increased mortality (29 % vs. 19 %, P = 0. 001). Whilst in multivariable analyses an increasing Status Epilepticus Severity Score (<b>STESS)</b> was an independent predictor for death in both groups, increased Charlson Comorbidity Index and treatment refractory SE were associated with death only in patients with in-hospital SE. Continuous anaesthesia for refractory SE was associated with increased mortality only in patients with out-of-hospital SE. The area under the receiver operating curve was 0. 717 for prediction of death by <b>STESS</b> in patients with in-hospital SE and 0. 811 in patients with out-of-hospital SE.; Patients with in-hospital SE had more fatal aetiologies and comorbidities, refractory SE, less return to functional baseline, and increased mortality {{compared to patients with}} out-of-hospital SE. Whilst the <b>STESS</b> was a robust predictor for death in both groups, the association between continuous anaesthesia and death was limited to out-of-hospital SE...|$|E
