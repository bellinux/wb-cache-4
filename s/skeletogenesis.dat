HCS is an autosomal dominant disorder, only one parent with the defective gene is needed to pass the disorder to the offspring.Mutations within the last coding exon of NOTCH2 that remove the PEST domain and escape the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay {{have been shown to be}} the main cause of Hajdu-Cheney syndrome. The NOTCH2 gene plays a very important role in <b>skeletogenesis.</b> Mutations of NOTCH2 that seem to cause HCS occur in the last coding exon of the gene (exon 34). These mutations remove PEST domains, which mediate proteosomal destruction of the protein. These PEST domains are removed due to the premature stop codon in the amino acid sequence. All HCS alleles are observed to have premature protein destruction before the PEST sequence is fully translated. The result is a mature NOTCH2 gene with a partially completed PEST sequence. In some cases, no PEST sequence at all is seen. This leads to the no proteosomal destruction of the protein.The NOTCH2 gene is ubiquitously expressed in all embryonic tissue. When researching HCS in mice, the homozygous deletion of NOTCH2 leads to death. This observation is important because it explains how the HCS phenotype is not isolated to only one system of the body. NOTCH2 is also shown to regulate RANK-L osteoclastogenesis, which is the production of functional osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are the component that breaks bone down. This is why bone loss is observed in HCS patients, due to the overactivation of RANK-L.|$|E

40|$|Cell {{migration}} and differentiation are fundamental aspects of embryogenesis, {{essential to the}} development of any complex multicellular organism. Like most biological processes, the directional migration of different cell types and their differentiation into various specified cells with unique functions are regulated by intricate mechanisms, many details of which remain unresolved. The sea urchin embryo, which is optically clear and amenable {{to a wide variety of}} experimental manipulations, is an excellent model system to study these processes. Of specific significance is the formation of the embryonic endoskeleton, in which early cell {{migration and}} differentiation events can be observed in vivo. The sea urchin embryonic endoskeleton is formed by the sequential ingression, directed migration, and fusion of the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs). The fused PMCs then secrete a calcareous matrix, forming the characteristic rigid endoskeleton of the embryo. The mechanisms governing <b>skeletogenesis</b> have been of interest to researchers for decades. However, several aspects of its regulation are still unclear. The work described in this thesis details progress made in understanding cell migration and differentiation using <b>skeletogenesis</b> in the sea urchin embryo as a model. <b>Skeletogenesis</b> is regulated by a complex gene regulatory network (GRN) which is arguably the most complete developmental GRN presently available. The aim of this work was to build linkages between the components of this GRN and observable morphological events during <b>skeletogenesis.</b> Recent research into <b>skeletogenesis</b> has been mainly focused on deciphering the roles that upstream transcription factors play in the specification of PMCs. Hence, a significant gap exists in our knowledge of the functions of downstream morphoeffector genes regulated by these well-studied transcription factors. To this end, we have analyzed the roles of two novel morphoeffector genes, p 58 -a and p 58 -b, which encode similar type 1 transmembrane proteins. These two genes are expressed specifically in the PMCs throughout development. We find that the knockdown of either p 58 -a or p 58 -b results in defects in <b>skeletogenesis,</b> though PMC specification, migration and fusion occur unperturbed. We conclude that p 58 -a and p 58 -b most likely play a role in biomineralization. Additionally, we describe progress made in understanding the role that ectodermal cues play during <b>skeletogenesis,</b> another poorly understood aspect of this process. The precise and extremely replicable pattern of PMC migration to specific sites within the blastocoel during <b>skeletogenesis</b> has long been of interest to researchers. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling this process have remained mostly elusive. Recent studies have identified the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathways as playing significant roles in regulating cell migration and differentiation during <b>skeletogenesis</b> in the sea urchin species Paracentrotus lividus, though these studies provided few details on the specific roles each of these pathways play. The FGF and VEGF pathways have long been shown to play complex, sometimes interacting roles in cell migration during development, and our research aimed at revealing the fine details of their functions in the sea urchin embryo. We have found that in the sea urchin species Lytechinus variegatus, VEGF signaling plays a more significant role in regulating <b>skeletogenesis</b> than the FGF pathway. Blocking VEGF signaling leads to profound defects in skeletogenesis: all aspects of PMC migration are abolished in these morphants, and the extension of filopodia from the PMCs is compromised. We have also identified a separate role for VEGF signaling in the synthesis of the endoskeleton and in regulating the expression of several morphoeffector genes in the PMC gene regulatory network. Conversely, we observed that inhibiting FGF signaling does not lead to severe defects in <b>skeletogenesis,</b> as FGF morphant embryos form extensive skeletal elements. Lastly, we document the presence of reciprocal signals from the PMCs regulating gene expression in the ectoderm, a phenomenon not previously described. These findings significantly expand our understanding of the regulation of directional cell migration and differentiation during embryonic development...|$|E

To investigate the origin of larval and adult skeletogenic cells, I first performed transplantation experiments in Pseudocentrotus depressus and Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus, which have different skeletal phenotypes. When P. depressus PMCs were transplanted into H. pulcherrimus embryos, the donor phenotype was observed only in the early larval stage, whereas when secondary mesenchyme cells (SMCs) were transplanted, the donor phenotype was observed in late and metamorphic larvae. Second, a reporter construct driven by the spicule matrix protein 50 (SM 50) promoter was introduced into fertilized eggs and their PMCs/SMCs were transplanted.

By transient expression of reporter constructs containingmsp 130 promoter regions from direct- and indirect-developing species, we found that this evolutionary change in regulation is consistent with changes in the timing of action oftrans-acting factors in skeletogenic mesenchyme cells. We further used these experiments to show that theH. erythrogrammapromoter contains elements required for correct spatial expression in the primary mesenchyme cells of an indirect-developing host.

To identify physiologically relevant bioelectrical changes that occur during normal development of the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus, we tested a range of ion channel inhibitors, and thereby identified SCH 28080, a chemical inhibitor of the H+/K+ ATPase (HKA), as an inhibitor of <b>skeletogenesis.</b> In sea urchin embryos, the primary mesodermal lineage, the PMCs, produce biomineral in response to signals from the ectoderm. However, in SCH 28080 -treated embryos, aside from randomization of the left-right axis, the ectoderm is normally specified and differentiated, indicating that the block to <b>skeletogenesis</b> observed in SCH 28080 -treated embryos is PMC-specific. HKA inhibition did not interfere with PMC specification, and was sufficient to block continuing biomineralization when embryos were treated with SCH 28080 after the initiation of <b>skeletogenesis,</b> indicating that HKA activity is continuously required during biomineralization. Ion concentrations and voltage potential were abnormal in the PMCs in SCH 28080 -treated embryos, suggesting that these bioelectrical abnormalities prevent biomineralization.

To better understand <b>skeletogenesis</b> and mineralogy in extant scleractinian corals, we have investigated {{the nature of the}} initial calcium carbonate skeleton deposited by newly settling coral recruits. Settling Acropora millepora larvae were sampled daily for 10 days from initial attachment, and the carbonate mineralogy of their newly deposited skeletons was investigated. Bulk analyses using Raman and infrared spectroscopic methods revealed that the skeletons were predominantly comprised of aragonite, with no evidence of calcite or an amorphous precursor phase, although presence of the latter cannot be discounted. Sensitive selected area electron diffraction analyses of sub-micron areas of skeletal regions further consolidated these data. These findings help to address the uncertainty surrounding reported differences in carbonate mineralogy between larval and adult extant coral skeletons by indicating that skeletons of new coral recruits share the same aragonitic mineralogy as those of their mature counterparts. In this respect, we can expect that <b>skeletogenesis</b> in both larval and mature growth stages of scleractinian corals will be similarly affected by ocean acidification and predicted environmental changes...|$|E
40|$|Convergent {{evolution}} of echinoderm pluteus larva was examined {{from the standpoint}} of functional {{evolution of}} a transcription factor Ets 1 / 2. In sea urchins, Ets 1 / 2 plays {{a central role in the}} differentiation of larval skeletogenic mesenchyme cells. In addition, Ets 1 / 2 is suggested to be involved in adult <b>skeletogenesis.</b> Conversely, in starfish, although no skeletogenic cells differentiate during larval development, Ets 1 / 2 is also expressed in the larval mesoderm. Here, we confirmed that the starfish Ets 1 / 2 is indispensable for the differentiation of the larval mesoderm. This result led us to assume that, in the common ancestors of echinoderms, Ets 1 / 2 activates the transcription of distinct gene sets, one for the differentiation of the larval mesoderm and the other for the development of the adult skeleton. Thus, the acquisition of the larval skeleton involved target switching of Ets 1 / 2. Specifically, in the sea urchin lineage, Ets 1 / 2 activated a downstream target gene set for <b>skeletogenesis</b> during larval development in addition to a mesoderm target set. We examined whether this heterochronic activation of the skeletogenic target set was achieved by the molecular evolution of the Ets 1 / 2 transcription factor itself. We tested whether starfish Ets 1 / 2 induced <b>skeletogenesis</b> when injected into sea urchin eggs. We found that, in addition to ectopic induction of mesenchyme cells, starfish Ets 1 / 2 can activate some parts of the skeletogenic pathway in these mesenchyme cells. Thus, we suggest that the nature of the transcription factor Ets 1 / 2 did not change, but rather that some unidentified co-factor(s) for Ets 1 / 2 may distinguish between targets for the larval mesoderm and for <b>skeletogenesis.</b> Identification of the co-factor(s) will be key to understanding the molecular evolution underlying the evolution of the pluteus larvae...|$|E

For studies of gene function during embryogenesis, {{there is often}} need of a method for interfering with expression only at a specific developmental time or place. Here we show that in sea urchin embryos cis-regulatory control systems which operate only at specific times and places {{can be used to}} drive expression of short designed sequences targeting given primary transcripts, thereby effectively taking out the function of the target genes. The active sequences are designed to be complementary to intronic sequences of the primary transcript of the target genes. In this work, the target genes were the transcription factors alx 1 and ets 1, both required for <b>skeletogenesis,</b> and the regulatory drivers were from the sm 30 and tbr genes. The sm 30 gene is expressed only after skeletogenic cell ingression. When its regulatory apparatus was used as driver, the alx 1 and ets 1 repression constructs had the effect of preventing postgastrular <b>skeletogenesis,</b> while not interfering with earlier alx 1 and ets 1 function in promoting skeletogenic mesenchyme ingression. In contrast, repression constructs using the tbr driver, which is active in blastula stage, block ingression.

40|$|Morphogenesis, {{the process}} by which the tissues and organs of the embryo are {{properly}} shaped, is a fundamental feature of development. In the sea urchin, the formation of the calcified enodoskeleton is a major morphogenetic event. Differentiation of the skeletogenic primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) has been considered to occur in two phases: the autonomous specification of PMCs followed by signal-dependent patterning of PMCs and the embryonic skeleton they produce. Autonomous specification creates a homogenous population of PMCs, but the later differentiation of these cells is influenced by extrinsic signals that provide essential positional information. Recent studies showed that ectodermal growth factors are critically involved in the guidance of PMC migration and skeletal differentiation. However, {{a better understanding of the}} various signaling pathways that regulate <b>skeletogenesis</b> and their role in PMC gene expression remains to be established. This study examines the regulation of morphogenesis by signaling pathways, using <b>skeletogenesis</b> in the sea urchin embryo as a model. The aim of this study was to identify and study the roles of extrinsic signals in regulating PMC gene expression, focusing on the later, signal-dependent phase of PMC differentiation. By analyzing and classifying spatial expression patterns of 39 genes preferentially expressed in PMCs, I find that: 1) these genes are expressed non-uniformly within the PMC syncytium, reflecting a widespread influence of locally activated signals; 2) regions with elevated gene expression correlate with sites of rapid biomineral deposition at each stage; 3) non-uniform expression of genes within the PMC syncytium is controlled by multiple signal in a precise temporal sequence. I also provide evidence that ectoderm-derived VEGF signaling regulates gene expression in PMCs via the MAPK pathway on the ventral side of the embryo. Additionally, my work has identified an essential role for TGF-β signaling in <b>skeletogenesis.</b> Previous studies indicate that a complete repertoire of TGF-β signaling components is present in the sea urchin genome and TgfbrII mRNA is preferentially expressed in PMCs at the early gastrula stage. In this study, I show that TgfbrII mRNA is specifically expressed in the PMC lineage from the hatched blastula to the mid-gastrula stage. Perturbation experiments indicate that TgfbrII is activated by the single, sensu stricto TGF-β ligand in sea urchins and is required for <b>skeletogenesis</b> in the sea urchin embryo. I also show that the late activity of Alk 4 / 5 / 7, the putative Type I receptor, regulates <b>skeletogenesis</b> in a dose-dependent manner. Isolation and in vitro culture of PMCs demonstrates that both Alk 4 / 5 / 7 and TgfbrII function cell autonomously in these cells. I provide evidence that TGF-β-TgfbrII signaling is not involved in dorsal-ventral axis patterning or PMC specification; instead, this pathway plays a selective role in later skeletal patterning. Taken as a whole, my research demonstrates that <b>skeletogenesis</b> is regulated by a much more diverse suite of signaling pathways than was previously appreciated.

Most of the previously described developmental tables in Chondrichthyes have focused on embryonic external morphology only. Due to its small body size and relative simplicity to raise eggs in laboratory conditions, the small-spotted catshark Scyliorhinus canicula {{has emerged as a}} reference species to describe developmental mechanisms in the Chondrichthyes lineage. Here we investigate the dynamic of mineralization in a set of six embryonic specimens using X-ray microtomography and describe the developing units of both the dermal skeleton (teeth and dermal scales) and endoskeleton (vertebral axis). This preliminary data on <b>skeletogenesis</b> in the catshark sets the first bases to a more complete investigation of the skeletal developmental in Chondrichthyes. It should provide comparison points with data known in osteichthyans and could thus be used in the broader context of gnathostome skeletal evolution...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} gain a deeper {{understanding}} of bone development and regeneration {{it will be necessary to}} learn more about the genes involved in these processes by clinical and basic-science research. Evolutionary biology can also provide us with valuable hints about skeletal biology. In the present work cDNA libraries from different stages of sheep fracture callus tissue were constructed from which over 47, 000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were sequenced. The EST distribution for genes in the different cDNA libraries was analyzed, and quantitative RT-PCR analysis was additionally performed for 87 genes with a potential function during fracture healing. Among these were 53 genes, for which a function in skeletal devlopment or in fracture repair had not been previously reported. Besides the identification of novel candidate genes for fracture healing, the EST sequences are an important resource for research using the sheep as model organism. In a developmental approach, expression profiles of E 14. 5 Runx 2 wildtype and knockout mouse humeri were compared in order to find genes with relevance for <b>skeletogenesis.</b> Runx 2 encodes a transcription factor that is essential for <b>skeletogenesis.</b> In this screen, 71 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed and were confirmed by real-time PCR. For 31 of these genes, a role in <b>skeletogenesis</b> has not yet been described. After determination of the expression patterns of the candidate genes, an evolutionary biology approach was used to identify potential direct Runx 2 target genes. Promoter regions of candidate genes were screened for Runx 2 binding sites that are conserved between different species. Using this approach five novel potential Runx 2 target genes were identified. Furthermore the analysis of Runt gene family evolution led to novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of <b>skeletogenesis.</b> Cloning and phylogenetic analysis of three Runt homologous genes of the lesser spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula showed that the dogfish Runt genes are orthologs of the mammalian Runx 1 - 3 genes. Expression analysis of the Runt homologous genes of dogfish, hagfish and amphioxus as well as the amphioxus Sox 9 indicates, that these genes have an evolutionarily conserved function in development of the skeleton and its precursor structures. It could be shown, that this molecular machinery, which is essential for <b>skeletogenesis,</b> is also present in cephalochordates and not only in vertebrates and is thus approximately 100 million years older than previously thought. 1.

40|$|Partitioning-defective (par) genes were {{originally}} identified as genes {{that are essential}} for the asymmetric division of the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote. Studies have since revealed that the gene products {{are part of an}} evolutionarily conserved PAR-atypical protein kinase C system involved in cell polarity in various biological contexts. In this study, we analyzed the function of par 6 during sea urchin morphogenesis by morpholino-mediated knockdown and by manipulation swapping of the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs). Loss of Par 6 resulted in defects in <b>skeletogenesis</b> and gut differentiation in larvae. Phenotypic analyses of chimeras constructed by PMC swapping showed that Par 6 in non-PMCs is required for differentiation of archenteron into functional gut. In contrast, Par 6 in both PMCs and ectodermal cells cooperatively regulates <b>skeletogenesis.</b> We suggest that Par 6 in PMCs plays an immediate role in the deposition of biomineral in the syncytial cable, whereas Par 6 in ectoderm may stabilize skeletal rods via an unknown signal(s). © 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Wnt {{antagonist}} Frzb- 1 {{is expressed}} during limb <b>skeletogenesis,</b> but its roles in this complex multistep process {{are not fully}} understood. To address this issue, we determined Frzb- 1 gene expression patterns during chick long bone development and carried out gain- and loss-of-function studies by misexpression of Frzb- 1, Wnt- 8 (a known Frzb- 1 target), or different forms of the intracellular Wnt mediator LEF- 1 in developing limbs and cultured chondrocytes. Frzb- 1 expression was quite strong in mesenchymal prechondrogenic condensations and then characterized epiphyseal articular chondrocytes and prehypertrophic chondrocytes in growth plates. Virally driven Frzb- 1 misexpression caused shortening of skeletal elements, joint fusion, and delayed chondrocyte maturation, with consequent inhibition of matrix mineralization, metalloprotease expression, and marrow/bone formation. In good agreement, misexpression of Frzb- 1 or a dominant-negative form of LEF- 1 in cultured chondrocytes maintained the cells at an immature stage. Instead, misexpression of Wnt- 8 or a constitutively active LEF- 1 strongly promoted chondrocyte maturation, hypertrophy, and calcification. Immunostaining revealed that the distribution of endogenous Wnt mediator β-catenin changes dramatically in vivo and in vitro, from largely cytoplasmic in immature proliferating and prehypertrophic chondrocytes to nuclear in hypertrophic mineralizing chondrocytes. Misexpression of Frzb- 1 prevented β-catenin nuclear relocalization in chondrocytes in vivo or in vitro. The data demonstrate that Frzb- 1 exerts a strong influence on limb <b>skeletogenesis</b> and is a powerful and direct modulator of chondrocyte maturation, phenotype, and function. Phases of <b>skeletogenesis,</b> such as terminal chondrocyte maturation and joint formation, appear to be particularly dependent on Wnt signaling and thus very sensitive to Frzb- 1 antagonistic action...|$|E
40|$|<b>Skeletogenesis</b> is a {{continuous}} process occurring during fish larval development that {{is influenced by}} vitamin K VK, an essential factor for the correct formation of coagulation factors and skeletal matrix proteins.

40|$|Dorsoventral {{patterning}} {{depends on}} the local concentrations of the morphogens. Twisted gastrulation (TSG) regulates the extracellular availability of a mesoderm inducer, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP- 4). However, TSG function in vivo is still unclear. We isolated a TSG cDNA as a secreted molecule from the mouse aorta-gonad-mesonephros region. Here we show that TSG-deficient mice were born healthy, but {{more than half of}} the neonatal pups showed severe growth retardation shortly after birth and displayed dwarfism with delayed endochondral ossification and lymphopenia, followed by death within a month. TSG-deficient thymus was atrophic, and phosphorylation of SMAD 1 was augmented in the thymocytes, suggesting enhanced BMP- 4 signaling in the thymus. Since BMP- 4 promotes <b>skeletogenesis</b> and inhibits thymus development, our findings suggest that TSG acts as both a BMP- 4 agonist in <b>skeletogenesis</b> and a BMP- 4 antagonist in T-cell development. Although lymphopenia in TSG-deficient mice would partly be ascribed to systemic effects of runtiness and wasting, our findings may also provide a clue for understanding the pathogenesis of human dwarfism with combined immunodeficiency...|$|E
