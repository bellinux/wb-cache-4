5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the <b>soil.</b> <b>To</b> allow the <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E
5|$|Increasing ozone {{pollution}} is causing tissue {{damage to the}} massive giant sequoia trees in the park, making them more vulnerable to insect infestation and disease. Since the cones of these trees require fire-touched <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> germinate, historic fire suppression has reduced these trees' ability to reproduce. The current policy of setting prescribed fires is expected to help the germination issue.|$|E
5|$|Older trees {{sometimes}} grow epicormic shoots {{directly from}} their trunks after storm or ﬁre damage. Aerial rhizomes {{can also be}} produced from the trunk if it sustains damage or has become hollow, and grow down into the <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> regenerate the plant. Such regeneration can lead to trees of great age with multiple trunks.|$|E

5|$|Their main tunnels {{are used}} for feeding and for escape: they can dig {{themselves}} underground very rapidly, and can move along existing tunnels at high speed both forwards and backwards. Their digging technique is to force the <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> either side with their powerful, shovel-like forelimbs, which are broad, flattened, toothed and heavily sclerotised (the cuticle is hardened and darkened).|$|E
5|$|Construction was of crossed wooden poles, {{driven into}} the {{waterlogged}} <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> support a walkway that consisted mainly of planks of oak, laid end-to-end. The track was used {{for a period of}} only around ten years and was then abandoned, probably due to rising water levels. Following its discovery in 1970, most of the track has been left in its original location, with active conservation measures taken, including a water pumping and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some of the track is stored at the British Museum and at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. A reconstruction has been made on which visitors can walk, on the same line as the original in Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve.|$|E

5|$|Legumes such as clover or alfalfa {{are usually}} higher in protein, calcium, and energy than grasses. However, they require warm weather and good <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> produce the best nutrients. Legume hays are {{generally}} higher in protein than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they {{are high in}} protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{have been}} {{observed}} blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> prevent them from leaving their nest during {{the early hours of}} the day. Banded sugar ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving their nest by blocking their nesting holes with debris, a behaviour known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade, banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area, while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material. Meat ants sometimes attract cats because of the chemicals they secrete (dihydronepetalactone, isodihydronepetalactone and iridomyrmecin).|$|E

5|$|Rarely cultivated, Banksia ilicifolia {{requires}} a sunny position and sandy well-drained <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> do well. A slow-growing plant, it takes {{up to ten}} years to flower from seed. The glossy green foliage and long flowering period, combined with prominently displayed flowers give it horticultural potential, although its prickly foliage makes fallen leaves a problem if planted near lawns or walkways. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 22 to 41 days to germinate. Difficulties in collection and low seed set make seed relatively expensive. Seeds are often eaten by insects {{before they can be}} collected.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Aachen {{was a major}} combat {{action of}} World War II, fought by American and German forces in and around Aachen, Germany, between 12 September–21 October 1944. The city had been {{incorporated}} into the Siegfried Line, the main defensive network on Germany's western border; the Allies had hoped to capture it quickly and advance into the industrialized Ruhr Basin. Although most of Aachen's civilian population was evacuated before the battle began, {{much of the city}} was destroyed and both sides suffered heavy losses. It was one of the largest urban battles fought by U.S. forces in World War II, and the first city on German <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> be captured by the Allies. The battle ended with a German surrender, but their tenacious defense significantly disrupted Allied plans for the advance into Germany.|$|E

5|$|The {{improvements}} {{of animal}} husbandry {{in the medieval}} period in Europe went {{hand in hand with}} other developments. Improvements to the plough allowed the <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> be tilled to a greater depth. Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, new ideas on crop rotation were developed and the growing of crops for winter fodder gained ground. Peas, beans and vetches became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.|$|E
5|$|The rocky cliffs, common {{features}} downstream of the Minho's estuary, disappear in Póvoa de Varzim, {{giving way to}} a coastal plain. The plain {{is located in a}} cuspate foreland, an old marine plateau from the Plio-Pleistocene, conferring a sandy <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> the coastal lands. The sand dunes in the Northwestern coast formed during the Little Ice Age and started piling up in the 15th or 16th century. Wandering along the coast one discerns Cape Santo André, the tip of the cuspate foreland and the Avarus Promontory, referred to by Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash's {{primary use}} {{is that of}} a soil enricher. Once the {{minerals}} in ash are washed into the soil by rain or other natural processes, it mixes with the <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> create an andisol layer. This layer is highly rich in nutrients and is very good for agricultural use; the presence of lush forests on volcanic islands is often as a result of trees growing and flourishing in the phosphorus and nitrogen-rich andisol.|$|E

These resting structures remain in the <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E
5|$|With {{the success}} of these projects, IPF has been doing {{revegetation}} projects along the road below the Top Cut since 2004. Compost blankets were applied to large sections of the <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> replace lost nutrients. In 2009 the foundation began removing metal and rebar snow fences embedded in the soil just below the pass summit during the 1960s as part of an abortive project to increase meltwater capture by the Twin Lakes Tunnel. They were an aesthetic blight as well as an environmental problem, and had to be removed using a team of mules and helicopters due to the wilderness area restrictions. The last fence material was removed in 2012.|$|E
5|$|After Bunker Hill, Lafayette went to Maine and Vermont, thus visiting {{all of the}} states.

Lafayette celebrated his 68th birthday on 6 September at a reception with President John Quincy Adams at the White House, and departed the next day. He took with him, besides the <b>soil</b> <b>to</b> be placed on his grave, other gifts. Congress, at Monroe's request, had voted him $200,000 in gratitude for his services to the country, and a large tract of public lands in Florida. The passage back to France was aboard a ship that was originally called the Susquehanna, but was renamed the USS Brandywine in honor of the battle where the Marquis de Lafayette shed his blood for the United States.|$|E
