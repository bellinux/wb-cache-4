50|$|Many of the Sunshine Coast's towns {{began as}} simple ports or jetties for the timber {{industry}} during the 1860s and 1870s, as the area once had magnificent stands of forest. Likewise, the region's roads often began as <b>snigging</b> tracks for hauling timber. Timbergetters used the region's creeks, rivers and lakes as seaways to float out their logs of cedar - the resultant wood being shipped as far afield as Europe.|$|E

5000|$|The Ravenshore viaduct by Snighole is locally {{known as}} 'Little Blackpool', and was {{particularly}} {{popular in the}} late nineteenth and early twentieth century as a bathing place when people had neither the time or resources to travel far for their leisure. In the later part of the twentieth century the river suffered from serious pollution from local industry, although this is now very much improved. In the river close to the viaduct there are scratched drawings in the rocks dating back to the time when the area was much used by local bathers. The word <b>snig</b> is a local dialect term for eel. (<b>Snig</b> can also be a word for grass snake in parts of Lancashire.) ...|$|R
40|$|Managing {{the impacts}} of erosion after forest {{harvesting}} requires knowledge of erosion sources; rates of sediment transport and storage; as well as losses from the system. We construct a tracer-based (137 Cs) sediment budget to quantify these parameters. The budget shows significant redistribution, storage and transport of sediment between landscape elements and identifies the <b>snig</b> tracks and log landings as the major impact sites in the catchment. Annual sediment losses from them were estimated to be 25 ± 11 and 101 ± 15 t ha− 1 year− 1, respectively, however, {{it is probable that}} most of this is due to mechanical displacement of soil at the time of harvesting. The budget showed greatest net transport of material occurring from <b>snig</b> tracks; representing some 11 ± 4 % of the 137 Cs budget. Of the latter amount, 18 %, 28 % and 43 % was accounted for within the cross banks, filter strip and General Harvest Area (GHA), respectively. The 137 Cs budget also showed the GHA to be a significant sediment trap. The filter strip played a fundamental role in the trapping of material generated from the <b>snig</b> tracks, the mass delivery to them from this source was calculated to be 1. 7 ± 0. 6 kg m 2 year− 1. Careful management of these remains critical. Overall we could account for 97 ± 10 % of 137 Cs. This retention suggests that (within errors) the overall runoff management system of dispersing flow (and sediment) from the highly compacted <b>snig</b> tracks, by cross banks, into the less compacted (and larger area) GHA and filter strips has effectively retained surface soil and sediment mobilised as a result of harvesting at this site.

40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) and {{ultrasound imaging}} systems {{are widely used}} for applications in remote sensing and medical diagnosis, respectively. However, the SAR and ultrasound images get corrupted by speckle noise {{during the process of}} image generation. The presence of speckle gives these images a granular appearance, thus hampering the interpretation of the image and reducing the efficiency of the algorithms in performing tasks such as compression, segmentation and classification. Hence, it is crucial to reduce the speckle from the SAR and ultrasound images before performing analysis or processing of these images. The objective of this thesis is to develop efficient wavelet-based methods for an improved reduction of the speckle from SAR and medical ultrasound images at a reduced computational cost. It is shown that the symmetric normal inverse Gaussian (<b>SNIG)</b> distribution is highly suitable for modelling the wavelet coefficients of the log-transformed reflectivity. Bayesian minimum mean absolute error, minimum mean squared error and maximum a posteriori estimators are developed using the <b>SNIG</b> PDFs. Fast and efficient techniques are introduced to estimate the model parameters from the noisy wavelet coefficients. A fast and efficient technique is presented to calculate the Bayesian minimum mean absolute error and minimum mean squared error estimators, while closed-form expressions are obtained for the Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimators. New methods of reduced complexity are proposed to incorporate the spatial dependencies of the wavelet coefficients with the Bayesian estimation processes. Extensive simulations using synthetically-speckled, SAR and medical ultrasound images are carried out to study the performance of the proposed techniques and the results show that they perform better than several existing techniques in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio, speckle statistics, edge preservation index, structural similarity index, ability to suppress the speckle in the homogeneous regions and visual quality, without an undue increase in computational complexity. Finally, it is shown that the <b>SNIG</b> PDF {{can also be used to}} advantage in developing an efficient method for the classical case of reducing the additive white Gaussian noise from natural images...|$|R

Whirlow House is a large modern building dating from 1993, the previous building on the site also known as Whirlow House was built by the solicitor Frederick Wilson in 1841.

50|$|Meanwhile, {{following}} {{the purchase of}} the <b>Snig</b> Brook Brewery in 1863, the brewery continued to prosper and develop in size. During this period, Eanam Brewery expanded production to provide 100,000 barrels a year by 1878. The business also had to adapt to various pieces of legislation, introduced by Gladstone's Liberal government. The 1869 Wine and Beer House Act gave licensing power back to the magistrates and was intended as a measure of control over the more unsavoury beer shops. It was followed by the Intoxicating Liquor Licensing Act of 1872, which introduced higher licence fees, licensing inspectors, reduced opening hours, restrictions on the sale of spirits to those 'apparently under the age of 16' and increased penalties for licensing offences.|$|R
50|$|In 1847 the <b>Snig's</b> End {{estate in}} the {{northeast}} of the parish was acquired by the National Land Company, which established a Chartist settlement. It was the third of the Chartist estates. By 1848 a school-house and 85 cottages had been built. The single-storey brick cottages, of the same design as on other Chartist estates, have four rooms and a front with a central pediment or low gable. The settlement was not a success, and the tenants resisted paying their rent; the National Land Company was dissolved under an Act of 1851. The building planned to include the school, and also, apparently, offices and communal rooms, is a one-storey brick building in the same style as the cottages; by 1870 it had become the Prince of Wales public house.|$|R
