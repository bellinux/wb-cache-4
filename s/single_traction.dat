Five transportation routes were taken into account, while making statistical calculations of signifi cant variances in traction parameters of the transit, concerning consumption of energy of the consumed fuel. While making direct statistical calculations using the method of multiple comparisons, there were taken into account modules {{of each of these}} lines which make up transits backwards and forwards.

40|$|After {{describing}} {{the development of}} the ISDV, this thesis studies the energy management which can improve the energy efficiency. It is shown that the traditional electric vehicle (EV) is not capable of managing the energy required for one driving cycle because it has only a <b>single</b> <b>traction</b> motor. This thesis proposes and examines a new way to manage electrical energy in which torque is distributed among different in-wheel motors to achieve a higher level of overall energy efficiency, which has been enhanced and demonstrated in various driving cycles. Thereafter, the thesis studies two aspects of benefits the ISDV can bring to parking. One is in space efficiency, defined as the ratio of the total space occupied by the vehicle in its final parked state over the whole area covered by the parking lot. Comparison of the ISDV and traditional vehicles in parking proves that the ISDV afford a higher level of space efficiency. The other aspect is the parking time. It is tested experimentally in the hardware-in-loop (HIL) system, and the motions of traditional vehicles, the zero radius turning motion, and the free motion of the ISDV are compared. The less time for parking demonstrates the easiness to steer the ISDV. Throughout the history of human civilization, vehicles have played a significant role by connecting people in various locations. They have thus boosted the progress of civilization and made our lives more convenient. However, as the number of vehicles on the road has increased, the convenience, which vehicles provide, has gradually turned into inconvenience in three respects: 1) the energy consumed by vehicles accounts for a large proportion of total energy consumption, which is in an ever-increasing trend; 2) more parking space is needed, a significant proportion of which is not for parking itself but for enabling the vehicle to be navigated to its final parking slot; 3) the effort required to park a car is also troublesome, causing the driver to spend much more time in a crowded parking lot. To alleviate these three problems, I develop a methodology to design an independent steering and driving vehicle (ISDV). It brings together the robotic technologies of steer-by-wire, drive-by-wire, four-wheel-independent-steering, and four-wheel-independent-driving. All four wheels of the ISDV can be steered independently, so that vehicle rotation and translation can be decoupled from each other. Omni-directional motions such as zero radius turning (ZRT) and lateral parking (LP) are realized, thereby enhancing the agility of the vehicle. In contrast with omni-directional wheeled mobile robots, this vehicle is targeted at serving as a human carrier or even as a vehicle carrier in the future. Qian, Huihuan. Adviser: Yangsheng Xu.

50|$|In 1985 {{what may}} in retrospect {{be viewed as}} the harbinger of private rail {{operation}} occurred when the quarry company Foster Yeoman bought a small number of extremely powerful 3600 hp locomotives from General Motors' Electromotive Division (GM-EMD), designated British Rail Class 59, to operate mineral trains from their quarry in Wiltshire. Although owned and maintained by Foster Yeoman, the Class 59s were manned by British Rail staff.

We found that contractility at the cell scale (force, speed of contraction, mechanical power) was indeed adapted to external stiffness and reflected ATPase activity of non-muscle myosin II and acto-myosin response to load.

The case of this model yields harmonic impedances consistent with existing models and demonstrates the well known, but greatly ignored, phenomenon of harmonic conversion.

40|$|Drives are {{basically}} used to transmit power and speed from the prime mover to the machine. The power transmission and speed reduction between the prime-mover and the driven machine {{can be achieved}} by using conventional drives like Belt drive, Rope drive, Chain drive, Gears, etc. with their numerous advantages and disadvantages. There are many machines and mechanical units that under varying circumstances make it desirable to be able to drive at a barely perceptible speed, an intermediate speed or a high speed. Thus an infinitely variable (step less) speed variation in which it is possible to get any desirable speed. Some mechanical, hydraulic, drives serve as such step less drives. However the torque versus speed characteristics of these drives do not match torque at low speeds. Hence the need of a step less or infinitely variable speed drive came into existence.

40|$|About 80 % {{of farms}} in India {{are less than}} five acres in size and are {{cultivated}} by farmers who use bullocks for farming operations. Even the smallest tractors available in the Indian market are too expensive and large, and not {{designed to meet the}} unique requirements of these farmers. To address these needs, we have developed a proof-of-concept lightweight (350 kg) tractor in collaboration with Mahindra and Mahindra Limited, an Indian tractor manufacturer. Given the challenges of accurately predicting traction in Indian soils by applying existing terramechanics models, an alternative design approach based on Mohr-Coulomb soil-failure criterion is presented. Analysis of weight, power and drawbar of existing tractors on the market, a <b>single</b> wheel <b>traction</b> test, and a drawbar test of a proof-of-concept small tractor prototype suggest that ~ 200 kg is the maximum drawbar force that could be achieved by a 350 kg tractor of conventional design.

In this work, we performed pulsed-field gradient NMR experiments to investigate water self-diffusion in a <b>single</b> membrane under <b>traction.</b> The data were collected with a high signal-to-noise ratio and small draw ratio steps using a specially design NMR probe together with a mini traction apparatus. The results demonstrate that the anisotropy of diffusion is much larger in a membrane under traction than in a stack of membranes that were uniaxiafly stretched at high temperature before the measurements. Arguments based on the mechanical properties of Nafion can explain qualitatively the observed differences by highlighting the important role of both applied stress and temperature in the stress-induced order. We used a simple, but realistic, deformation model to analyze the experimental data by extracting the evolution of the diffusion anisotropy {{as a function of the}} orientational order parameter of the water conducting channels.

40|$|Toll-like {{receptor}}- 4 (TLR 4) is the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide, yet it {{may also}} respond {{to a variety of}} endogenous molecules. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) {{is the leading cause of}} death from gastrointestinal disease in newborn infants and is characterized by intestinal mucosal destruction and impaired enterocyte migration due to increased TLR 4 signaling on enterocytes. The endogenous ligands for TLR 4 that lead to impaired enterocyte migration remain unknown. High mobility group box- 1 (HMGB 1) is a DNA-binding protein that is released from injured cells during inflammation. We thus hypothesize that extracellular HMGB 1 inhibits enterocyte migration via activation of TLR 4 and sought to define the pathways involved. We now demonstrate that murine and human NEC are associated with increased intestinal HMGB 1 expression, that serum HMGB 1 is increased in murine NEC, and that HMGB 1 inhibits enterocyte migration in vitro and in vivo in a TLR 4 -dependent manner. This finding was unique to enterocytes as HMGB 1 enhanced migration of inflammatory cells in vitro and in vivo. In seeking to understand the mechanisms involved, TLR 4 -dependent HMGB 1 signaling increased RhoA activation in enterocytes, increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, and increased phosphorylation of cofilin, resulting in increased stress fibers and focal adhesions. Using <b>single</b> cell force <b>traction</b> microscopy, the net effect of HMGB 1 signaling was a TLR 4 -dependent increase in cell force adhesion, accounting for the impaired enterocyte migration.
