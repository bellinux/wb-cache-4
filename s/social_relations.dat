The result of this study gives more clear and deeper describe concerning many kinds of meaning which are behind the fact so that this research uses phenomenological method with perspective interpretative. While the phenomenon is outsourcing practice in Makassar city. The result of this research shows that the <b>social</b> <b>relation</b> among actors user, provider and laborer in outsourcing practice in Makassar city is not just an ordinary economic relation but it is a veiled power relation which constructs a hegemonic <b>social</b> <b>relation.</b> The hegemonic <b>social</b> <b>relation</b> is caused by some factors, namely; (a) unlimited authority owned by user, (b) closed management applicated by provider, (c) laborer’s less bargaining position, and (d) lost government intervention. The four causes create the patterns and types of hegemonic <b>social</b> <b>relation</b> in outsourcing practice, namely; (1) absolute hegemony by user toward provider and laborer like, job outsourcing (job transfer), job responsibility transfer, and the use of manpower and more work time, (2) semi-hegemony by provider toward laborer by action of transferring laborer from one user to others, and (3) absolute hegemonized toward laborer by both user and provider through the use of laborer’s work power by user, outsourcing of laborer from one user to others done by provider. the fact, outsourcing practice benefits the captilists (user and provider), on the contrary, it harms the laborer.

5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory.

Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E

After {{his return to the}} University of Minnesota in 1966, Gottesman created a program on behavioral genetics, the first in the U.S. In 1972–1973 he received a Guggenheim fellowship to work with K.O.

5|$|Philosophies of the {{particular}} sciences range from questions {{about the nature of}} time raised by Einstein's general relativity, to the implications of economics for public policy. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be reduced to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual psychology? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the foundations of statistics. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the philosophy of medicine. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the social sciences explore whether the scientific studies of human nature can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by values and by <b>social</b> <b>relations.</b>|$|E
