The Efficient Determination Criterion (EDC) is a generalization of these criteria, proposed originally to define a <b>strongly</b> <b>consistent</b> class of <b>estimators</b> for the dependency order of a multiple Markov chain. In this work, the EDC is generalized to partially nested models, which encompass many other order identification problems.
