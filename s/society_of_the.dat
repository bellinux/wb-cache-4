5|$|Franklin {{opposed the}} {{creation}} of the Society because he viewed it, with its hereditary membership, as a noble order unwelcome in the newly independent Republic, contrary to the ideals of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, for whom the Society was named; his reference to the two kinds of birds is interpreted as a satirical comparison between the <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cincinnati and Cincinnatus.|$|E

5|$|More {{schools for}} the deaf were founded after ASD, and {{knowledge}} of ASL spread to these schools. In addition, the rise of Deaf community organizations bolstered the continued use of ASL.

This all contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.|$|E
