500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I Stuart was called up to service, as {{an officer in the}} Royal Naval Reserve. He was originally posted as a junior officer on board the old and obsolete destroyer HMS Opossum in Plymouth. This ship was used for harbour patrols and intercepting neutral merchant ships and other work Stuart considered tedious. He became increasingly impatient with the life and repeatedly applied to his senior officers with requests for transfer; at one point he even requested that he be commissioned into the army. All of these were turned down, with increasing levels of hostility from his commanders, one of whom was reported to have told him to [...] "Go to hell! And <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> you!" ...|$|E

60|$|I {{went out}} and <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> me, and stood and thanked God {{from the bottom of}} my heart.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He has {{the richest}} humour!' cried Brass, <b>shutting</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> him; 'the most amazing vein of comicality! But isn't it rather injudicious, sir--?' ...|$|R
6000|$|WE have <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>behind</b> us, and <b>the</b> velvet [...] {{flowers of}} night Lean about us {{scattering}} their pollen grains of [...] golden light.|$|R

60|$|He was gone, and had <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> him. They {{looked at}} each other, and nodded approvingly: Dennis stirred up the fire.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} woman, sharply. Without another word {{she turned and}} was gone, <b>shutting</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> her. A few moments later the trim {{carriage}} flashed past the window, turned down the crowded Haymarket, and was engulfed in the traffic.|$|R
6000|$|McFarlane entered {{slowly and}} <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> him. His manner was serious, {{and his voice}} gravely gentle as he said: [...] "I hope that {{telegram}} does not call you away?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Without {{more words}} the great {{criminal}} investigator went into <b>the</b> lighted library, <b>shutting</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> him, and Fisher, without replying, turned {{and began to}} talk quietly to Travers.

6000|$|... 'We {{came out}} of Flora's Temple, and <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>behind</b> us. Some stars were showing then--same as when Cain did his little act, I guess.

6000|$|... "I daresay, my dear," [...] said Lord Henry, <b>shutting</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> her, as, {{looking like}} a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the rain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of frangipanni. Then he lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on the sofa.|$|R
60|$|Norah {{shook hands}} with him, and {{accompanied}} him to the landing. She <b>shut</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> her and stood outside {{for a couple of}} minutes. Philip wondered what they were talking about.|$|E

50|$|The police {{arrive at}} the house as Blinky is {{cleaning}} up supposedly the parents' blood.

60|$|But he {{left the}} room with Razumov, <b>shutting</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> him. <b>The</b> landing was {{prolonged}} into a bare corridor, right and left, desolate perspectives of white and gold decoration without a strip of carpet. The very light, pouring through a large window at the end, seemed dusty; and a solitary speck reposing on the balustrade of white marble--the silk top-hat of the great feminist--asserted itself extremely, black and glossy in all that crude whiteness.|$|R
