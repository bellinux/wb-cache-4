50|$|Abba Estifanos (English Translation: Father Stephen) was an Ethiopian Christian monk, {{itinerant}} {{preacher and}} martyr {{who is known}} for his reformation movement and as an early dissident of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Emperor Zara Ya'iqob in the 15th century. His followers were known as <b>Stephanites</b> and were known for advocating sola gratia (salvation by grace alone through faith, not of works), soli Deo gloria (veneration to God alone and not to religious icons and saints) and for their asceticism. Over the course of a century of persecution by clergy and five consecutive kings following Zara Ya'iqob, membership in the <b>Stephanites</b> movement dwindled and vanished.Estifanos was a proponent of soli Deo gloria which placed him at odds with Ethiopian Orthodox Church authorities and Emperor Zara Ya'iqob as his teachings deemed prostration as an act reserved to God alone and hence the teaching of The Church of Ethiopia that prostration for veneration of saints, angelic beings, religious icons and monarch (Zara Ya'iqob) was wrong. His reformation movement taking place close to seventy years prior to European Protestant reformation, the similar tenets that it has with Protestantism and the exponential growth of Evangelicals membership in Ethiopia in the late 20th century has sparked a new interest in his life and that of his followers.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the burning}} of Estifanos' literatures and books, {{we do not have}} the full volume of his teachings.

He removed the banner of monks and celebrated Christian liberty, He held a traditional view of the Trinity, stressed on holiness, and it has also been suggested at some levels he has thought and believed in sola scriptura (bible alone) even though he didn't use the exact words to formulate his teaching on the subject.|$|R
40|$|The present {{treatise}} {{attempts to}} offer an insight into the Modern Greek Metaphrase of <b>Stephanites</b> and Ichnelates (henceforth SI), by Theodosios Zygomalas (1584). In this respect, it contains the edited text along with a thorough analysis of the author’s language—a controversial mixture of purist and modern elements. The SI-text originated from Simeon Seth’s purist SI (11 th C.), itself a translation from Arabic, probably commissioned by Alexios I Comnenos (1081 - 1118 AD). The Arabic text is known as Kalilah wa Dimnah or as Fables of Bidpai or Pilpai and is attributed to a scholar known as Ibn-Al-Muqaffa, of Persian descent, who {{is considered to be}} the father of Arabic prose. Ibn-Al-Muqaffa relied on a Persian (Pahlavi) text which has not been preserved. That particular text had been taken from India to Persia by a doctor, Borzuya, Barzawayh in Arabic, on orders from King Khosroes I, a. k. a. Anushirwan (531 - 579 AD) of the Sassanian dynasty. Of particular interest {{is the fact that the}} Panchatantra can be classified as belonging to the Mirrors for Princes genre, which includes many popular literary works of many cultures going as far back as the early Christian era. At first, I expound the history of the Pañcatantra text with emphasis on its origin and its translation into several languages. Then, I detail the handwritten tradition of the Theodosios Zygomalas metaphrase and more specifically the text compiled by Symeon Seth. Hence I present all extant Greek MSs and pick out the ones containing the Modern Greek version. I continue by drafting a broad outline of Theodosios Zygomalas’ life and trying to trace his contacts with the scholars of his era. Then I treat the subject of translation-paraphrase and metaphrase from the point of view of intertextuality, which leads me to the conclusion that Zygomalas rewrote the SI text in a language widely used by his contemporaries, which is why I describe his work as “metaphrase”. In the fifth chapter I trace the connection between the two versions of the Byzantine text (recensions a for Seth and b for Eugene) to the Modern Greek Zygomalas metaphrase. In the sixth chapter I analyze his language from the point of view of grammar and syntax. In the seventh chapter I compare the language of Theodosios Zygomalas in SI with the one in Synopsis Minor (ed. Perentidis) and Thematoepistolae (ed. Toufexis). In the eighth chapter I compare the SI text with the text in «Δύο Μῦθοι…» (ed. Niki Eideneier). And in the ninth chapter I describe the basic guidelines I followed in editing the text. The Theodosios Zygomalas metaphrase of Symeon Seth’s <b>Stephanites</b> kai Ichnelates was completed in 1584, which can be concluded from the various MS subscripts, and has survived to this day in a number of MSs, most of which date from the 17 th century. This can be partly explained by the fact that the Mirrors for Princes, a genre to which <b>Stephanites</b> belongs, went through a renaissance since it was now written in a language which was accessible to a much larger segment of the population...|$|R

50|$|It is {{generally}} held {{that it was}} a hermit by the name Abba Gebre Nazrawi, who had fled religious persecution in the province of Shoa due to his teachings on sola gratia, that first introduced Estifanos to the teaching that salvation is obtained by the grace of God through faith in the redemptive work of Jesus' crucifixion, and not of works. It was this notion that Estifanos took from Gebre Nazrawi and expounded through scriptural studies and meditations giving the hermit a theological framework for the teaching. Following his convictions, Estifanos started (date unknown) proclaiming the doctrine to fellow monks and then to the general public. Estifanos rapidly gained a number of followers, and despite his teaching on sola gratia, Estifanos developed an elaborate teaching on good works not as prerequisites for salvation but rather as fruits of salvation, that led him to denounce alcohol and promote self-denial to an extent that his opponents in the monastery could not keep up with. He developed a network of evangelists to carry out missionary work of distributing his literature, manuscripts of the Bible and help the needy. His lifestyle coupled with his teaching drew an ever growing number of adherents which were referred to as dekika estifa (students of Estifanos) or known as <b>Stephanites.</b>|$|R

ABSTRACT:Pallancata is a world-class intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposit, hosted by upper Miocene volcanics of the south-central Peruvian Andes in a sinuous N 70 ºW, ∼ 75 º SW strike-slip structure, with wide (up to 35 m) pull-apart dilation zones related to bends of the vein strike. The structural {{evolution of the}} vein from earlier brecciation to later open space infill resembles the Shila Paula district (Chauvet et al. 2006). Fluid inclusion petrography and microthermometry show that ore deposition is related to protracted boiling of very diluted, mainly meteoric fluids, starting at 250 – 260 ºC, under ∼ 300 m hydrostatic head. The mineralogical-petrological study reveals a complex sequence of mineralization (eight stages) and mineral reactions consistent with Ag 2 S enrichment or Sb 2 S 3 depletion, or both, during cooling over the temperature range 250 – 200 ºC: pyrite, sphalerite, galena, miargyrite, pyrargyrite-proustite, chalcopyrite, polybasite-pearceite, argentite (now acanthite), and Au–Ag alloy (“electrum”). This Ag 2 S enrichment and Sb 2 S 3 depletion during cooling {{may be explained by}} decay of a Ag-rich galena precursor at deeper levels (Pb 2 S 2 –AgSbS 2 solid solution), which rapidly becomes unstable with decreasing temperature, producing residual (stoichiometric) PbS and more mobile Ag and Sb sulfide phases, which migrated upward and laterally away from the thermal core of the system. The core is still undisclosed by mining works, but the available geochemical evidence (logAg/log Pb ratios decreasing at depth) is consistent with this interpretation, implying a deeper potential resource. Data from sulfide geothermometry, based on mineral equilibria, document the thermal evolution of the system below 200 ºC (<b>stephanite,</b> uytenbogaardtite, jalpaite, stromeyerite, mckinstryite, among others). The end of the most productive stages (3, 4, and 5) is marked by the precipitation of <b>stephanite</b> at temperatures below 197 ± 5 ºC, but precipitation of residual silver continues through the waning stages of the hydrothermal system down to < 93. 3 ºC (stromeyerite) or in a supergene redistribution (stage 8, acanthite II) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Elatsite {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{operating}} porphyry-copper deposits in Eastern Europe, and is also enriched in Au-Ag-Te-Se and PGE. The magnetite-bornite-chalcopyrite ore assemblage, preserved mainly in the central K-alteration core, has been examined by means of electron microprobe and SEM. Au-Ag-Te-Se minerals are abundant, and include macroscopic gold with high fineness. The ores are also enriched in hessite, stützite, sylvanite, merenskyite, empressite, wittichenite and clausthalite, found as exsolutions in bornite and chalcopyrite. Paragenetic relations display initial saturation of native Te with sylvanite (AuAgTe 2), followed by increasing Me/Te ratio from 1 : 1 to 2 : 1 in hessite (Ag 2 Te). Tellurides within bornite with early macroscopic (> 100 µm) gold with high fineness (> 900) took place at high fTe 2 (- 4;- 8) and fO 2 conditions near to the magnetite-hematite buffer. The hessite-clausthalite association in chalcopyrite and the formation of <b>stephanite,</b> together with the drop in fineness of the late microscopic (< 100 µm) gold (< 650), indicate decrease of fTe 2 (- 18;- 19) and fS 2 (- 13;- 14) and temperatures < 200 oC in the late Te-, Se- and Au-bearing associations...|$|E

We have obtained 121 Sb Mössbauer spectra for several sulfide series : silver (miargyrite, <b>stephanite,</b> and pyrargyrite), copper (chalcostibite, tetrahedrite, and famatinite), lead (zinkenite, semseyite, and boulangerite), lead and another metal (meneghinite (Cu), jamesonite (Fe) and bournonite (Cu)), and miscellaneous (ullmannite (NiSbS), stibnite (Sb 2 S 3), goldfieldite (Cu 3 (Te, Sb, As) S 4), livingstonite (HgSb 4 S 8), and berthierite (FeSb 2 S 4)). The oxides studied included bindheimite (Pb 2 Sb 2 U 6 (O, OH)), tripuhyite (FeSbO 4), partzite (Cu 2 Sb 2 U 6 (O, OH)), and ordonezite (ZnSb 2 O 6). The only sulfide mineral studied which gave a spectra indicating a five oxidation state for the antimony is famatinite. The isomer shift for this mineral is the most negative of any Sb(V) reported in the literature. The opposite was noted for the oxides, i. e. in all cases the antimony is Sb(V). Isomer shifts were often found to be dependent on the metal ligand which is not bonded directly to the antimony, but through an oxygen or sulfur bridge. Linewidth data often indicate whether one or more than one antimony site exist in the crystal. While quadrupole coupling constants were obtained for many of the minerals studied, lack of precision of such values yielded only marginal information. In several cases 57 Fe Mössbauer spectra were taken to compliment the 121 Sb information...|$|E

The LCT deposit is hosted by an Early Carboniferous sedimentary sequence intruded by Early Permian intrusive rocks, whereas the BHX deposit occurs in the Early Permian volcano-sedimentary sequence. The igneous units occurring at LCT and BHX are geochemically characterised by calc-alkaline affinities, and yield Early Permian age as revealed by the LA-ICPMS U-Pb zircon geochronological study. Detailed mineralogical and paragenetic studies indicate that the LCT deposit has five mineralisation stages including single syn-mineralisation stage (i. e., stage 2), whereas seven mineralisation stages are recognised at the BHX deposit including three syn-mineralisation stages (i. e., Stages 1, 2 and 3). Alteration is extensively formed at LCT and BHX associated with the Au-rich vein systems, consisting mainly of sericite, chlorite, adularia and quartz assemblages. On the basis of core assay and the electrum fineness data, the vein system of the Stage 2 at LCT and the Stage 1 at BHXT are identified as Au-rich system, whereas the Stages 2 and 3 of BHX are recognised to be Ag-rich vein system. Gold at LCT occurs as electrum and native gold, while the occurrence of electrum, native silver and <b>stephanite</b> is found at BHX.

40|$|A {{study of}} the North Bullion Carlin system, a Nevada Carlin-type gold {{prospect}} located on trend with the large Carlin-type gold deposits (CTGD) of the Carlin Trend, identified characteristics of ore and alteration mineralization, mineral paragenesis, and pyrite and whole rock geochemistry {{that are similar to}} characteristics that typify Carlin-type gold deposits. The North Bullion Carlin system is hosted in Devonian shelf carbonates and the Mississippian overlap assemblage, host rocks that are different from typical CTGD shelf-slope carbonate assemblage host rocks. The mineralogy and ore-stage gold-bearing pyrite rims at North Bullion are not as well developed as they are in typical CTGD, and alteration and geochemical relationships are subtle. Yet the North Bullion Carlin system exhibits many of the features observed in large deposits. Observations demonstrate that North Bullion Carlin system is a CTGD, potentially on the periphery of a larger system. Gold mineralization at the North Bullion Carlin system is controlled by structures, which include the North Bullion Fault Zone and the Massif Fault, and stratigraphic controls, which include the lithologic contacts between the Devonian Devils Gate Collapse Breccia, Mississippian Webb Formation, and Mississippian Chainman Formation. The uppermost horizon of gold mineralization is located at a lithological contact between limestone and mudstone within the Webb Formation, and grade decreases away from this contact in the mudstone. The lowermost horizon of gold mineralization is located within the Devonian Devil’s Gate collapse breccia and the multi-lithic tectonic breccia along the North Bullion Fault Zone and Massif fault. Gold mineralization does not extend above the uppermost dacite dikes and sills within the Mississippian Chainman Formation, suggesting the dacite dikes and sills provided a local seal to the deposit. Cross-cutting relationships, textures, and geochemistry indicated the presence of four generations of pyrite. Pre-ore stage (POS) pyrites formed during diagenesis of the Devonian Devil’s Gate Formation, Mississippian Webb Formation, and Mississippian Chainman Formation. Pre-ore stage pyrites contain Fe, S, Co, Ni, Pb, Ag, and Sn, with variable Bi, Ti, and Zn. Ore-stage 1 (OS 1) pyrites are Au-bearing hydrothermal pyrites within the 38. 2 Ma Tertiary porphyritic dacite dikes. Electron probe microanalyzer and LA-ICP-MS quantified Fe, S, Co, and Pb, with variable Bi and Ti, and Au in OS 1 pyrites, but did not detect significant As, Tl, Hb, or Sb. Ore-stage 2 (OS 2) pyrites are more typical Carlin-type Au-bearing pyrites that form partial sub-micrometer rims on POS and OS 1 pyrites and OS 2 microcrystals. Based on electron probe microanalyzer and LA-ICP-MS analyses, OS 2 pyrites contain Au and variable As, Cu, Hg, Sb, and Tl. Late-ore-stage (LOS) pyrites cross-cut sedimentary host rock minerals and late-ore-stage drusy quartz. Late-ore-stage pyrites contain Fe, S, Pb, and Ag, with variable Bi, Sn, and Zn, and locally contain Au, As and Sb. Ore-stage 1 pyrites within Tertiary porphyritic dacite dikes are associated with quartz, illite, and kaolinite. Ore-stage 2 pyrites that rim POS pyrites in sedimentary host rocks are associated with jasperoid, illite, and carbon; OS 2 pyrites that rim OS 1 pyrites in dacite dikes are associated with quartz, illite, and kaolinite. Late-ore-stage minerals within sedimentary host rocks include secondary quartz, late-ore-stage pyrite, realgar, and calcite. Post-ore-stage minerals within sedimentary host rocks include barite, <b>stephanite,</b> kaolinite, halloysite, and oxide minerals. High-grade silver intervals at North Bullion Carlin system (≤ ~ 20 oz/t) result from the presence of the mineral <b>stephanite</b> (Ag 5 SbS 4) that precipitated after Carlin-type gold mineralization, is unrelated to Carlin-type mineralization, and is likely related to one of the post-dacite igneous intrusive events. A compilation of statistical analyses including classification support vector machine, non-metric multi-dimensional scaling model, Spearman rank correlation matrix, and Mann-Whitney U-Test on whole rock geochemistry on 5 ’drill core samples reveal the key elements related to gold and deposit scale trends. These statistical analyses and models illustrate that in samples with a low gold grade (0. 1 ppm Au) the elements that best correlate with Au, with decreasing correlation, are Hg, Sb, Tl, and/or As. In samples with a moderate gold grade (1. 0 ppm Au) the elements that best correlate with Au, with decreasing correlation, are Tl, Hg, and As. Gold correlates positively with Fe, S, Pb, Co, Ni, Cu, Al, and K identifying these elements as good indicators predicting the presence of gold. Gold correlates negatively with elements in carbonate host rocks (Ba, Ca, Mg, Mn, and Sr), and these elements indicate of the absence of gold. Silver, Mo, and Zn do not correlate with Au. At the deposit scale the North Bullion Carlin system exhibits characteristics of ore, alteration, and mineral paragenesis that are typical of Carlin-type gold deposits, but the mineralization is subtle and not as well developed as in large, high-grade deposits. At the micro-scale the ore pyrites, and whole rock geochemistry are similar to typical Carlin-type gold deposits. The Carlin-type pathfinder trace elements, As, Hg, Sb, and Tl, best correlate with gold in ore-stage mineralization. Statistical analyses of whole rock geochemistry indicate that Ba, Mn, Al, P, Cr, and V are the elements that provide the best vector to ore and could identify the periphery of gold mineralization...|$|E

It is hosted by volcano-sedimentary units, which are typically tuffaceous and andesitic breccias. The ore body consists {{of a set of}} subvertical E-W vein systems developed under a sinistral strike-slip regime that included transtensive domains with generalized extensional structures where the ores were deposited. The deposit is divided into two blocks by a set of NNW-ESE-trending reverse faults, which uplifted the eastern block and exhumed thicker and deeper parts of the deposit. At least 200 m of volcano-sedimentary pile hosting the mineralization has been eroded in this block. By contrast, the western block exposes a shallower part of the system where cherts, amorphous silica and jasperoids occur. Three main stages of mineralization have been defined: (1) pre-ore stage is characterized by early quartz, pyrite and arsenopyrite, (2) base-metal and silver stage; characterized by sphalerite (6 to 15 mol% FeS), galena, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and Ag-bearing minerals (freibergite, polybasite, <b>stephanite,</b> pyrargyrite, freieslebenite and acanthite) and (3) post-ore stage; characterized by late quartz, kutnohorite and minor sulfides (arsenopyrite, sphalerite, pyrite, galena, Ag-bearing minerals and Pb-sulfosalts). Whole-ore geochemistry shows two groups of elements that are positively correlated; 1) Ag-Cd-Cu-Pb-Zn related to the base metal sulfides and 2) Au-As-Ge-Sb-W related to arsenopyrite and pyrite. Hydrothermal alteration is pervasive in the outcropping mineralized areas, including silicification and locally, vuggy silica textures. At depth, chloritic and sericitic alteration is developed along vein selvages and is superimposed to the regional propylitic alteration. Fluid inclusions indicate that the base-metal ores were deposited from 250 to 150 degrees C moderate salinity fluids (1 - 9 wt. % NaCl). The pre-ore stage is characterized by a saline fluid (6 - 22 wt. % NaCl) and between 210 and 250 degrees C whereas the post-ore stage has salinity of 4 - 8 wt. % and temperature from 175 to 215 degrees C. Cooling was the mechanism of ore mineral precipitation in the Patricia deposit, although mixing of fluids could have occurred in the pre-ore stage. Mineralogical, geochemical and fluid inclusion evidence is consistent with an intermediate sulfidation (IS) epithermal deposit type. This study highlights the high potential for hidden economic mineralization at depth in the western block and for extension of the ore body both to the south and to deeper levels in the eastern block of the Patricia ore deposit. To a larger extent, the implications of finding such polymetallic epithermal style of mineralization in the northern Chile Precordillera is relevant both to the regional metallogenic perspective and to the exploration potential of the region, where the late Eocene-early Oligocene metallogenic belt apparently disappears.

40|$|The Arburese region (SW Sardinia) is {{well-known}} {{for a large}} swarm of mineralized veins hosted in low-grade metamorphic rocks, extending for about 20 km around the Late Variscan (304 ± 1 Ma) Arbus pluton, {{made up of a}} core of cordierite-bearing biotite leucogranites and an external shell of granodiorites with subordinate mafic rocks (Cuccuru et al., 2015). The largest veins occur in the northern and western sectors (past Montevecchio district), with a primary mineral association of Pb-Zn (Cu, Ag) sulfides in quartz and siderite. Recent works on the southern branch of the vein system (Naitza et al., 2015) evidenced a more complex metallogeny, with Ni-Co-As-Sb-Bi-Pb-Zn-Cu-Ag ores. New microscopy, SEM-EDS and EPMA data allow to highlight the depositional history of these ores, defining two stages of mineralization. In the Arsenide stage, early precipitation of quartz with abundant Ni monoarsenide (nickeline) was followed by growth of Ni antimonide (breithauptite) on nickeline, by Ni, Ni-Co, Co, Fe diarsenides, triarsenides, sulfoarsenides (rammelsbergite, skutterudite, safflorite/löllingite, cobaltite, gersdorffite/ullmannite) and Bi minerals (bismuthinite and native Bi), replacing nickeline and forming rims and inclusions on previously crystallized phases. The Sulfide stage was preceded by cataclasis of the ores; initial abundant precipitation of quartz, siderite and sphalerite, cementing the fragments of the arsenide ores, was followed by Pb-Cu-Ag sulfides (galena, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite/freibergite, bournonite, proustite/pyrargirite, <b>stephanite),</b> and, at last, by ankerite, calcite and pyrite. These sequences of mineralization suggest a relationship with distinct hydrothermal fluids: 1) an earlier fluid, carrying Ni, Co, As and Sb, deposited as arsenides and sulfoarsenides into structurally-controlled traps in response to variations in physicochemical conditions; 2) a late, carbonate and Pb-Zn-Cu-Ag -rich fluid, permeating fractures re-opened after a tectonic phase that involved the previous mineralization, and originating a “Montevecchio-type” mineral association. Depositional histories similar to the Arsenide stage have been reported in other hydrothermal Ni-Co deposits worldwide, as in the Bou Azzer district, Morocco (Ahmed et al., 2009). The geochemistry of these ores requires the presence in the geological sequence of a Ni-Co-rich source (e. g. mafic rocks) from which these elements could be leached by acidic and moderately oxidizing hot fluids. Analogous conditions may have been attained in the Arbus pluton, which includes an olivine-bearing end member (Secchi et al., 1991), possible Ni-Co source for fluids of magmatic origin. During the emplacement of the igneous complex, widespread uralitization of pyroxenes in granodiorites point to high fluid/rock interactions; moreover, quartz- Fe-cordierite graphic intergrowths in leucogranites support a late dehydration of magmas.

40|$|The Rävliden North deposit (Rävliden N) is a volcanogenic massive {{sulphide}} (VMS) deposit in {{the western}} part of the Skellefte district, northern Sweden. The district is one of Sweden’s major metallogenic provinces with a significant amount of VMS deposits. The Rävliden N deposit, discovered in 2011, contains copper, zinc, lead, silver and subordinate gold and occurs close to the largest VMS deposit in the district, the Kristineberg deposit, which has been mined for more than 70 years. The purpose of this master thesis is to study the composition, mineralogy and paragenetic relationships in different types of sulphide mineralization from the Rävliden N deposit. Emphasis is placed on characterizing the distribution and paragenetic relationships of silver-bearing minerals. The methods include core logging, sampling and mineralogical studies through light optical microscopy (LOM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantitative evaluation of mineralogy by scanning electron microscopy (QEMSCAN). Lastly, electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) was used to determine the chemical composition of silver-bearing minerals and sulphides. Mineralization types studied include 1 : the main massive to semi-massive sulphide mineralization, 2 : stratigraphically underlying stringer mineralization and 3 : local, vein- and/or fault-hosted silver-rich mineralization in the stratigraphic hanging wall. The massive to semi-massive sulphide mineralization is dominated by sphalerite with lesser galena and pyrrhotite. In contrast, the stringer mineralization is dominated by chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite. The major minerals show evidence of a coeval formation and textural as well as structural evidence suggest that ductile deformation has affected the mineralization types. Notable evidence includes ball-ore textures, accumulation of minerals in pressure shadows and brittle fracturing of competent arsenopyrite and pyrite porphyroblasts and infilling by more incompetent sulphide minerals. The silver-bearing minerals identified are commonly spatially associated with galena and the major species is freibergite ((Ag,Cu,Fe) 12 (Sb,As) 4 S 13), which also occur as inclusions in chalcopyrite mainly in the stringer mineralization. The stringer mineralization also contains notable amounts of hessite (Ag 2 Te). Notably, galena, pyrrhotite, freibergite and other sulphosalt minerals are commonly accumulated in pressure shadows near host rock fragments in the massive to semi-massive sulphide mineralization. The only gold-bearing mineral identified in this study is electrum (Au, Ag) in the stringer mineralization. The hanging wall mineralization locally comprises faulted and/or sheared massive sulphide mineralization which is compositionally similar to the main massive to semi-massive sulphide mineralization, besides a significantly higher content of freibergite. However, parts of the hanging wall mineralization are entirely dominated by sulphides and sulphosalts of silver, such as pyrargyrite (Ag 3 SbS 3), pyrostilpnite (Ag 3 SbS 3), argentopyrite (AgFe 2 S 4), sternbergite (AgFe 2 S 3) and <b>stephanite</b> (Ag 5 SbS 4). These occur in structurally late settings, which along with consideration of their temperature stabilities suggest a late origin. Since the silver-bearing minerals in the massive to semi-massive sulphide mineralization and the two varieties of hanging wall mineralization contains the same metals, the mineralization in the hanging wall may have formed by late-stage remobilization of ore components from the underlying Rävliden N deposit. This negates the need for multiple mineralization events to explain the local silver-enriched zones in the hanging wall. The paragenetically late mineralization types contains high content of Ag-bearing minerals in relation to base metal sulphides. This suggests that remobilisation processes were important for locally upgrading the Ag-content. ...|$|E
