40|$|The growing {{probabilities of}} {{additional}} offspring with the beneficial reversal allele for various population sizes, N, sequence lengths, L, <b>selective</b> <b>advantages,</b> s, fitness parameters, k, and measuring parameters, C, were calculated in an asymmetric sharply-peaked landscape using the decoupled continuous-time mutation-selection model. The growing probability in the stochastic region was {{inversely proportional to}} the measuring parameter when C 1 /Ns^*, where s^* is the effective <b>selective</b> <b>advantage.</b> The saturated growing probability in the stochastic region was approximately the effective <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> when C≫ 1 /Ns^* and s^*≪ 1. The present study suggests that the growing probability in the stochastic region in an asymmetric sharply-peaked landscape in the decoupled continuous-time mutation-selection model can be described using the theoretical formula for the growing probability in the Moran two-allele model. The <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> ratio, which represents {{the ratio of the}} effective <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> to the <b>selective</b> <b>advantage,</b> does not depend on the population size, <b>selective</b> <b>advantage,</b> measuring parameter, and fitness parameter; instead the <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> ratio decreases with increasing the sequence length.

40|$|We {{characterized}} the <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> profiles of {{a panel of}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS 3 protease mutants with three HCV protease inhibitors (PIs), BILN- 2061, ITMN- 191, and VX- 950, using a genotype 1 b HCV replicon system. <b>Selective</b> <b>advantage</b> curves were generated by a novel mathematical method that factors {{in the degree of}} drug susceptibility provided by the mutation, the base-level replication capacity of the mutant in the absence of drugs, and the overall viral replication levels as a function of drug concentration. Most of the mutants showed significantly increased <b>selective</b> <b>advantages</b> over the wild-type species upon drug treatment. Each drug is associated with unique <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> profiles that reflect its antiviral activity and mutant susceptibility. Five mutants (R 155 K/Q, A 156 T, and D 168 A/V) showed significant levels of <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> after treatment with > 10 nM (∼ 7 times the wild-type 50 % effective concentration [EC 50]) of BILN- 2061. R 155 K displayed dominant levels of <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> over the other mutants upon treatment with ITMN- 191 over a broad range of concentrations. Upon VX- 950 treatment, various mutants (A 156 T, A 156 S, R 155 K, T 54 A, V 170 A, V 36 M/R 155 K, and R 155 Q) exhibited high levels of <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> in different drug concentration ranges, with A 156 T and A 156 S being the dominant mutants at > 3 μM (∼ 10 times the wild-type EC 50) of VX- 950. This method provides more accurate estimates of the behavior of various mutants under drug pressure than replication capacity analysis. We noted that the R 155 K mutant shows reduced susceptibility to all three PIs and significant <b>selective</b> <b>advantage,</b> raising concern over the potential emergence of R 155 K as a multidrug-resistant, highly fit mutant in HCV patients treated with PIs...|$|R
50|$|It {{appears that}} cancers may {{frequently}} be initiated by an epigenetic reduction in expression {{of one or}} more DNA repair enzymes. Reduced DNA repair likely allows accumulation of DNA damages. Error prone translesion synthesis past some of these DNA damages may give rise to a mutation with a <b>selective</b> <b>advantage.</b> A clonal patch with a <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> may grow and out-compete neighboring cells, forming a field defect. While there is no obvious <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> for a cell to have reduced DNA repair, the epimutation of the DNA repair gene may be carried along as a passenger when the cells with the selectively advantageous mutation are replicated. In the cells carrying both the epimutation of the DNA repair gene and the mutation with the <b>selective</b> <b>advantage,</b> further DNA damages will accumulate, and these could, in turn, give rise to further mutations with still greater <b>selective</b> <b>advantages.</b> Epigenetic defects in DNA repair may thus contribute to the characteristic high frequency of mutations in the genomes of cancers, and cause their carcinogenic progression.|$|R

50|$|The <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> of coat {{color for}} {{concealment}} and regulation of body temperature likely caused geographic variation of coat color as well.

50|$|The light-producing {{chemistry}} behind bioluminescence varies {{across the}} lineages of bioluminescent organisms. Based on this observation, bioluminescence {{is believed to}} have evolved independently at least 40 times. In bioluminescent bacteria, the reclassification of the members ofVibrio fischeri species group as a new genus, Aliivibrio, has led to increased interest in the evolutionary origins of bioluminescence. Among bacteria, the distribution of bioluminescent species is polyphyletic. For instance, while all species in the terrestrial genus Photorhabdus are luminescent, the genera Aliivibrio, Photobacterium, Shewanella and Vibrio contain both luminous and non-luminous species. Despite bioluminescence in bacteria not sharing a common origin, they all share a gene sequence in common. The appearance of the highly conserved lux operon in bacteria from very different ecological niches suggests a strong <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> despite the high energetic costs of producing light. DNA repair is thought to be the initial <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> for light production in bacteria. Consequently, the lux operon may have been lost in bacteria that evolved more efficient DNA repair systems but retained in those where visible light became a <b>selective</b> <b>advantage.</b> The evolution of quorum sensing {{is believed to have}} afforded further <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> for light production. Quorum sensing allows bacteria to conserve energy by ensuring that they do not synthesize light-producing chemicals unless a sufficient concentration are present to be visible.|$|R

A proposed adaptive advantage of meiosis is that it facilitates recombinational repair of DNA damages that are otherwise difficult to repair (see DNA repair as the adaptive advantage of meiosis).

The <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> of complementation may largely account for the general avoidance of inbreeding (see kin recognition).|$|R

40|$|A point {{mutation}} in the DNA polymerase gene in equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV- 1) is one determinant {{for the development}} of neurological disease in horses. Three recently conducted infection experiments using domestic horses and ponies failed to detect statistically significant differences in viral shedding between the neuropathogenic and non-neuropathogenic variants. These results were interpreted as suggesting the absence of a consistent <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> of the neuropathogenic variant and therefore appeared to be inconsistent with a systematic increase in the prevalence of neuropathogenic strains. To overcome potential problems of low statistical power related to small group sizes in these infection experiments, we integrated raw data from all three experiments into a single statistical analysis. The results of this combined analysis showed that infection with the neuropathogenic EHV- 1 variant led to a statistically significant increase in viral shedding. This finding is consistent with the idea that neuropathogenic strains could have a <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> and are therefore systematically increasing in prevalence in domestic horse populations. However, further studies are required to determine whether a <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> indeed exists for neuropathogenic strains...|$|R
