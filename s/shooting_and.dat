40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of osmotic stress on forage sorghum varieties at critical stage of germination to salinity stress. A study was conducted at the Seed Technology Laboratory of Mansoura University, Egypt during April to June 2012. Three forage sorghum cultivars (Mabrouk, Horas, Pionner- 8581) were evaluated in the salinity concentrations of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 dSm- 1 NaCl. Four parameters namely final germination percentage, germination index, energy of germination and seedling vigour index were estimated. Eight seedling characters namely <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> root length, <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> root foliage weight, <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> root dry weight, seedling height reduction and relative seedling dry weight were measured. Forage sorghum cultivars significantly varied in means of final germination percentage, germination index, seedling vigor index, energy of germination, <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> root lengths, <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> root fresh weights, <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> root dry weights, seedling height reduction and relative dry weight. Horas cultivar surpassed other cultivars {{in all of the}} studied characters followed by Mabrouk cultivar which came in the second rank, while Pioneer 858 cultivar came in the last rank. Pioneer 858 cultivar recorded highest values of seedling height reduction and relative dry weight followed by Mabrouk cultivar, while, Horas cultivar came in the last rank for both characters. Increasing salinity levels from 0 to 15 dSm- 1 significantly decreased germination percentage, germination index, seedling vigor index, energy of germination, <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> root lengths, <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> root fresh weights, <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> root dry weights and relative dry weight, the control treatment recorded the highest averages of these characters. Thus, the lowest averages of these characters were recorded with highest salinity levels i. e. 15 dSm- 1. Seedling height reduction percentage was increased significantly with increasing salinity levels from 0 to 15 dSm- 1. Results clearly showed that germination index, seedling vigor index, <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> root lengths, <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> root fresh weights, <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> root dry weights, seedling height reduction and relative dry weight significantly affected by the interaction between forage sorghum cultivars and salinity concentrations. It could be concluded that Hoars cultivar was more tolerant to salinity stress followed by Mabrouk cultivars which must be put in breeding program of forage sorghum under salinity conditions...|$|R

40|$|Multiplication {{rate was}} always {{used as the}} sole {{parameter}} for assessment of the optimal treatment for in vitro shoot formation. However, beside {{its effect on the}} shoot formation, different treatments had different impact on the production cost. Separated <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> cluster of different sizes (1, 2, 3 <b>and</b> 4 <b>shoots</b> per cluster) of Smooth cayenne pineapple were cultured at density of 1, 2, 3 <b>and</b> 4 separated <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> 1 cluster on agar solidified full strength MS medium enriched with sucrose at 30 g L - 1 and BAP at 2. 25 mg L - 1 for 2 months to investigate the effect of explants density and explant types on shoot formation per explant, total per liter <b>and</b> cost per <b>shoot.</b> Density of one separated shoot per culture resulted in the highest shoot formations per shoot (11 shoots) but lowest total shoot per liter (550 <b>shoots)</b> <b>and</b> highest cost per shoot (13 cents), while density of 4 shoots per culture resulted in lowest rate (4 shoots) but higher total per liter (1400 <b>shoots)</b> <b>and</b> lowest cost per shoot (10 cents). Cluster of two shoots had higher rate (7 <b>shoots)</b> <b>and</b> lower cost (16 cents) than cluster of 4 <b>shoots</b> (4 <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> 20 cents) but both resulted in equal total shoot per liter (750 shoots).

40|$|Arsenic (As) {{accumulation}} in rice grains {{is a risk}} {{to human}} health. The mechanism of transfer of As from the shoot into the grain during grain filling is unknown at present In this study As speciation in the <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> grains at maturity were examined, and the relationships between phosphorus (P) and As, and silicon (Si) and As were established {{in a wide range}} of cultivars grown in As contaminated field trials in Bangladesh and China. No correlations were observed between <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> grain speciation, with the inorganic form comprising 93. 0 - 97. 0 % of As in the <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> 63. 0 - 83. 7 % in the grains. The percentage of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) was between 1. 4 and 6. 6 % in the <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> 14. 6 and 37. 0 % in the grains; however, the concentrations were comparable, ranging from 0. 07 to 0. 26 mg kg(- 1) in the <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> 0. 03 to 0. 25 mg kg(- 1) in the grains. A positive correlation was observed between <b>shoot</b> As <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> Si, however, no correlation was observed between <b>shoot</b> Si <b>and</b> grain As. A significant negative correlation was observed between <b>shoot</b> P <b>and</b> grain As concentrations. These results suggest that the translocation of As into the grain from the shoots is potentially using P rather than Si transport mechanisms. The findings also indicate that inorganic As and DMA translocation to the grain differ considerably...|$|R
30|$|Since we {{measured}} several response variables {{from the same}} replicates, we first performed MANOVAs for the heavy metals found in the earthworms, in the composts, in the plant <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> roots and in the soil {{at the end of}} the experiment. Since we found no detectable quantities of Cd in the vermicompost <b>and</b> the <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> roots, and of Pb, Cr, Ni and Cd in the soil, these metals were excluded from the MANOVA analysis. Subsequently, individual heavy metals were compared among treatments with means tests. Weight of <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> roots was also analyzed combined with a MANOVA, followed by a means test procedure for <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> roots separately. We evaluated the homogeneity of variances and normality of residuals using Bartlett and Jarque–Bera tests.

40|$|Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) {{grown in}} acid soils (high Al) shows growth and root {{physiology}} symptoms similar to plants grown under drought. Since compatibility exists between Al tolerance and drought resistance, {{the effects of}} Aluminum (Al) toxicity and water deficit (WD) stresses on net photosynthesis, leaf stomatal conductance, growth traits, proline, organic acids, and mineral nutrient concentrations in <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> roots need to be determined. SC 283 (drought- and Al-tolerant) and 2 ̆ 7 Redlan 2 ̆ 7 (drought- and Al-sensitive) sorghum genotypes were grown under Al and WD individually, and Al + WD combined in nutrient solutions. ^ Photosynthesis and stomatal conductance decreased as Al and WD in nutrient solution increased. Additive Al + WD stresses decreased photosynthesis and stomatal conductance more than Al or WD separately. ^ Increased Al and WD stresses decreased <b>shoot,</b> root <b>and</b> total dry matter yields (DMY). Aluminum increased shoot/root DMY ratios, and WD increased shoot/root DMY ratios in some experiments and decreased them in others. Leaf areas and root lengths decreased similar to other DMY as Al level and WD increased. ^ Increased Al did not affect proline in <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> roots. Water deficit treatments increased proline, and had greater effect than Al. Combinations of 200 or 400 μM Al levels with - 0. 09 or - 0. 13 MPa WD resulted in higher proline in <b>shoots</b> <b>and</b> roots than Al or WD separately. Shoots had higher proline than roots. ^ Shoot organic acids were not affected when grown with Al. t-Aconitic acid in roots was less in plants grown with 200 μM Al than in plants grown at control treatment. Control compared to WD treatments increased <b>shoot</b> fumaric <b>and</b> oxalic acids. Water deficit affected <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> root organic acids more than Al. ^ Adding Al to nutrient solutions increased <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> root P and Al <b>and</b> decreased <b>shoot</b> S <b>and</b> Fe <b>and</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>and</b> root Mg, Ca, Mn, and Zn concentrations.
