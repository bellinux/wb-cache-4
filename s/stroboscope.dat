25|$|The strobe light, {{commonly}} called a strobe, is a device {{used to produce}} regular flashes of light. Modern uses of strobe lights serve a purpose for safety warning, and motion detection. Strobes can be found atop most police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks. The origin of strobe lighting dates to 1931, when Harold Eugene Edgerton invented a flashing lamp to make an improved <b>stroboscope</b> {{for the study of}} moving objects, eventually resulting in dramatic photographs of objects such as bullets in flight.|$|E
25|$|Flood beam CRTs {{are small}} tubes that are {{arranged}} as pixels for large screens like Jumbotrons. The first screen using this technology {{was introduced by}} Mitsubishi Electric for the 1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. It differs from a normal CRT in that the electron gun within does not produce a focused controllable beam. Instead, electrons are sprayed in a wide cone across the entire front of the phosphor screen, basically making each unit act as a single light bulb. Each one is coated with a red, green or blue phosphor, {{to make up the}} color sub-pixels. This technology has largely been replaced with light emitting diode displays. Unfocused and undeflected CRTs were used as grid-controlled <b>stroboscope</b> lamps since 1958.|$|E

2500|$|A {{strobe light}} or {{stroboscopic}} lamp, commonly called a strobe, is a device {{used to produce}} regular flashes of light.

50|$|A <b>stroboscope</b> {{also known}} as a strobe, is an {{instrument}} used to make a cyclically moving object appear to be slow-moving, or stationary. It consists of either a rotating disk with slots or holes or a lamp such as a flashtube which produces brief repetitive flashes of light. Usually the rate of the <b>stroboscope</b> is adjustable to different frequencies. When a rotating or vibrating object is observed with the <b>stroboscope</b> at its vibration frequency (or a submultiple of it), it appears stationary. Thus stroboscopes are also used to measure frequency.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I {{describe}} an LED strobe controller that I designed and built. With {{the advent of}} much brighter LEDs, {{it is possible to}} create <b>stroboscopes</b> with both high intensity output and high maximum flash rates. Additionally, the proliferation of Wi-Fi enabled devices provokes the idea of a next-generation interface for tools in Strobe Lab. The initial goal was to produce an LED-based strobe that has sufficient light to replace existing flash tube <b>stroboscopes.</b> The final product combines three high powered LEDs with a microcontroller and Wi-Fi card. Users can adjust settings through a web based interface accessible from both laptops and mobile devices. In addition to the simple user interface, the controller is compatible with other equipment in Strobe Lab as it can be triggered by the commonly used methods. Established techniques, such as sync and delay, and newer techniques, such as color-encoded multi-flash images, are possible with this device. by Nicholas E. Villalva. Thesis: M.

40|$|Underwater {{photographs}} of fishing gears and fish behavior are helpful for fishery technical developments and natural environment investigations. Although {{the spread of}} digital cameras is progressing, there are few which are easy to handle and have a reasonable price, {{and can be used}} for taking underwater images {{for a long period of}} time. We designed and engineered an underwater digital camera which combines a commercial digital camera and <b>stroboscopes</b> and can be used for observations in coastal fisheries surveys. The housing that stored the digital camera and <b>stroboscopes</b> could withstand underwater pressure to a depth of 400 m. We used a voltage controller to extend battery duration time and be able to take photographs for longer time. Maximum performance lasted 19 hours, taking photographs every 60 seconds interval. Photography experiments were conducted using a trawl net which was towed at a 160 m depth and a small set net located at a 10 m depth. In both we succeeded to take the good photographs at intervals of 30 seconds or 60 seconds. ...|$|R

50|$|If further {{evaluation}} is needed, stroboscopy {{is used to}} examine mucosal waves of the vocal cords. Mucosal waves describe the waves produced by vibration of the vocal cords during speech. <b>Stroboscopes</b> produce flashes of light that are timed to the patient's vocal frequency. Every time the light is flashed, it will create a still frame image of the vocal cords at that particular moment in time. These are combined to produce {{an image of the}} wave. In the case of Reinke's edema, structural changes to the vocal cords will result in abnormal wave patterns.|$|R
50|$|The streak camera, {{used for}} {{diagnostics}} in laser fusion, plasma radiation, and combustion, operates in burst mode only (providing just several frames) and requires synchronization {{of the camera}} with the event to be captured. It is therefore unable to capture random or transient events in biological systems. <b>Stroboscopes</b> have a complementary role: they can capture the dynamics of fast events—but only if the event is repetitive, such as rotations, vibrations, and oscillations. They are unable to capture non-repetitive random events that occur only once or do not occur at regular intervals.|$|R

50|$|Use {{of digital}} {{interconnect}} standards, such as CCIR 601 and SMPTE 292M, which operate without the non-linearities {{and other issues}} inherent to analogue broadcasting, do not introduce colour shifts or brightness changes; thus the requirement to detect and compensate for them using this reference signal has been virtually eliminated. (Compare with the obsolescence of <b>stroboscopes</b> as used to adjust the speed of record players). On the other hand, digital test signal generators do include test signals which are intended to stress the digital interface, and many sophisticated generators allow the insertion of jitter, bit errors, and other pathological conditions that can cause a digital interface to fail.|$|R

50|$|Early {{tests with}} wool tufts, <b>stroboscopes</b> and tiny windows had given some {{indications}} of the phenomena inside, {{but it was}} only in 1959, with an article in New Scientist, that Ricardo engineers Hempson and Scott were able to illustrate their argument with a sequence of colour photographs of actual combustion taking place. Taken using a series of mirrors and a Fastax camera running at 16,000 frames per second, this was {{the first of a series}} of major steps in advancing the understanding of the combustion process and the formation of pollutants within the cylinder. Crucially, engineers were no longer blind when it came to picturing combustion events, helping combustion chamber design to progress from an art to a science.|$|R
25|$|Among {{the most}} {{accurate}} tuning devices, strobe tuners work differently than regular electronic tuners. They are <b>stroboscopes</b> that flicker a light at the same frequency as the note. The light shines on a wheel that spins at a precise speed. The interaction of the light and regularly-spaced marks on the wheel creates a stroboscopic effect that makes the marks for a particular pitch appear to stand still when the pitch is in tune. These can tune instruments and audio devices more accurately than most non-strobe tuners. However, mechanical strobe units are expensive and delicate, and their moving parts require periodic servicing, so they are used mainly in applications that require higher precision, such as by professional instrument makers and repair experts.|$|R
