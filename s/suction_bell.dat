40|$|Lecturepg. 119 Sixteen (nine 1500 hp {{and seven}} 500 hp) single stage, {{vertical}} turbine, cooling water pumps suffered massive metal loss {{within two years}} of installation. All pumps had cast iron suction bells and semiopen, manganese bronze impellers. An accounting of the conditions {{that resulted in the}} perforation of the 2 in thick suction bells (one <b>suction</b> <b>bell</b> separated form the pump and fell {{to the bottom of the}} pit), including photographs, is given in this case history. Conclusions on how the damage occurred are given and other theories are considered. A description of the modifications to the pumps is given, as are the results of the followup inspections showing only normal wear. The large pumps were converted to enclosed impeller designs, but retained cast iron as the <b>suction</b> <b>bell</b> material. The smaller pumps still have open impellers, but the suction bells have been fitted with aluminum bronze inserts. This case history is given to show that current industry practice for general purpose (not utility class) water pumps is not adequate for larger size pumps...|$|E
40|$|Pump CWP (Circulating Water Pump) {{serve to}} provide {{water for the}} {{condenser}} is also for the makeup water tank. CWP structure consists of a <b>suction</b> <b>bell,</b> impeller chamber and impeller, diffuser, discharge elbow, lower the main shaft and the main upper shaft, electric motor. Cooler motors wrapped around {{the walls of the}} pump motor CWP. Cooler tube has a diameter of 14 mm and a thickness of 1 mm. In November 2011 there has been damage to the engine water pump. Date March 15, 2013 experienced the same case, the damage occurred in the pump cooler pump motor CWP bottom (lower shaft CWP 6). Cooler winding temperature at around 35 - 75 o C. This section serves to cool the temperature of the pump motor. Cooler pump motor is made of copper-type C 12250, included in a group of pure copper. The study was conducted to determine the causes and mechanisms of failure in elbow cooler. To {{find out more about the}} causes of the failure of this material then, an analysis of the failure of the observations in the form of macro, micro observations (metallographi), testing of SEM-EDX, XRD testing, as well as simulating fluent. Based on the results of testing that was done failures in the cooler tube elbow caused by corrosion-erosion. The mechanism of corrosion-erosion due to the combination of high flow rates and corrosive fluids. At high flow rates physically corrosive fluids clicking eliminate erosion and corrosion protection layer thus opening reactive metal underneath. Suspended slurries strengthen and accelerate erosion-corrosion (Accelerated erosion-corrosion attack). Key Word : Cooler, Erosi-korosi, elbow tube coole...|$|E
