5|$|The Duke of Wellington was {{becoming}} unpopular as Prime Minister, {{particularly in the}} industrial north west of England, for continually blocking proposed reforms. Huskisson <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as well placed to unite the two wings of the Tory party should the Duke retire, or to lead the reforming faction of the party into a split from the Tories and a progressive alliance with the Whigs. He also <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as a natural ally for the Duke, despite their political differences, as a Tory popular in Liverpool and Manchester, {{both of which were}} traditionally hostile to the party. Newspapers were already beginning to report rumours that Huskisson and his supporters were to be invited back into the government.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{arrived in}} Paris in late September 1831; {{he would never}} return to Poland, thus {{becoming}} one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's French origins, and always <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as a Pole.|$|E
5|$|Model's biographer, the {{military}} historian Steven Newton, {{argues that the}} best explanation for Model's behaviour {{is that he was}} not necessarily a Nazi, but an authoritarian militarist who saw in Hitler the strong leader that Germany needed. According to Newton, Model <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as the professional, apolitical soldier; he possessed a strong sense of German nationalism, with the accompanying tenets of racial prejudice against Slavs and Jews. This characterized many in the German officer corps, but in Model's case it was accompanied by a cynical willingness to placate the Nazi regime to expedite his own goals.|$|E

5|$|Orozco, who <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> {{as being}} {{instrumental}} in Madero's victory over Díaz, was merely appointed as a {{commander of the}} rurales in Chihuahua, which increased his resentment. When he tried {{to run for governor}} of the state, Madero supported his opponent, Abraham González and eventually pressured Orozco {{to drop out of the}} race. When, in the aftermath of the Plan of Ayala, Madero ordered Orozco to lead federal troops to suppress Zapata, Orozco refused. In March 1912, Orozco issued his Plan of Empacadora and formally declared himself in rebellion against Madero.|$|E
5|$|That season, Villa {{once again}} <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> playing Champions League football. He scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against Schalke 04 {{and went on}} to put Valencia 1–0 up against Chelsea, {{although}} goals from Joe Cole and Didier Drogba saw Valencia lose 2–1. Valencia finished bottom of the group and were knocked out. On his 100th league appearance for Valencia, Villa scored a hat-trick against Levante; his 54th, 55th and 56th league goals for the club. Another two goals {{on the final day of}} the season against Atlético Madrid completed his tally of 18 goals that season.|$|E
5|$|Castro stockpiled {{weapons for}} a planned {{attack on the}} Moncada Barracks, a {{military}} garrison outside Santiago de Cuba, Oriente. Castro's militants intended to dress in army uniforms and arrive at the base on July 25, the festival of St James, when many officers would be away. The rebels would seize control, raid the armory and escape before reinforcements arrived. Supplied with new weaponry, Castro intended to arm supporters and spark a revolution among Oriente's impoverished cane cutters. The plan was to then seize control of a Santiago radio station, broadcasting the Movement's manifesto, hence promoting further uprisings. Castro's plan emulated those of the 19th century Cuban independence fighters who had raided Spanish barracks; Castro <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as the heir to independence leader and national hero José Martí.|$|E

5|$|Insistent {{that his}} party take an equal {{role in the}} {{coalition}} government, Bruxner formed a good working relationship and long-lasting friendship with Stevens that would ensure the government's stability. The Stevens government had significant success, reducing Lang's 2 million pound deficit by 75%. However, one significant problem was that Stevens had trouble with an unruly backbench, and increasingly depended upon Bruxner and the Country Party. As Deputy Premier, Bruxner <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as loyal to Stevens, but still managed to push through several initiatives that specifically benefited rural areas, including another royal commission {{on the question of}} new States in 1935. The May 1935 election saw Stevens and Bruxner retaining government against a divided and fractious Labor opposition and Bruxner was returned unopposed again in his seat.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} book {{mentioned}} above, in 1908 Leo Tolstoy wrote A Letter to a Hindu, which said that only by using love as a weapon through passive resistance could the Indian people overthrow colonial rule. In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish A Letter to a Hindu in Gujarati. Tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until Tolstoy's death in 1910 (Tolstoy's last letter was to Gandhi). The letters concern practical and theological applications of nonviolence. Gandhi <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> a disciple of Tolstoy, for they agreed regarding opposition to state authority and colonialism; both hated violence and preached non-resistance. However, they differed sharply on political strategy. Gandhi called for political involvement; he was a nationalist and was prepared to use nonviolent force. He was also willing to compromise. It was at Tolstoy Farm where Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach systematically trained their disciples {{in the philosophy of}} nonviolence.|$|E
5|$|Hubbard's {{comments}} {{suggest that}} he <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> being {{directly involved in the}} film's production; author Stewart Lamont suggests that Hubbard may even have envisioned directing it, having previously helmed Scientology training films. In October 1983, the film rights were sold by the Church of Scientology's in-house literary agency, Author Services Inc., to Salem Productions of Los Angeles. Two films were envisaged, each covering half of the book and tentatively budgeted at $15 million each. William Immerman was set as the producer for the film. Veteran screenwriter Abraham Polonsky and British director Ken Annakin were hired to produce a film breakdown, with production scheduled to begin in 1985. In November 1984, Santa Monica public relations firm Dateline Communications announced a nationwide contest to promote the film. First- and second-place prizes were an all-expense-paid trip to the film's production location and a paid walk-on part in the film, and other announced prizes included a trip to Los Angeles for the world premiere, records, cassettes, and hardcover and paperback copies of the novel. A 30-foot (10m) high inflatable figure of the film's villain, Terl, was erected by Scientology officials on Hollywood Boulevard in 1984 in an effort to promote the production, and auditions were held in Denver. The low-budget project soon collapsed, and Hubbard died soon afterwards, in 1986.|$|E

25|$|Subsequently Schelling {{identified}} himself with Baruch de Spinoza, to whose thought he <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> as approaching.

25|$|In Aristotelian science, {{especially}} in biology, things he <b>saw</b> <b>himself</b> have {{stood the test}} of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition.

25|$|Thucydides omits {{discussion}} of the arts, literature or the social milieu in which the events in his book take place and in which he himself grew up.

25|$|Alfred {{undertook}} no systematic {{reform of}} ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex.

Even the facts of his death, which ended my doubts for ever, throw no light on that.|$|R
