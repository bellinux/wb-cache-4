Surrogacy was dealt with by means of guidelines proposed by the SA Law Commission after a surrogate mother was found. The gestational carrier was synchronized with the genetic donor with congenital absent uterus, the main aim being assisted reproduction. Two gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) procedures were performed, both unsuccessful. Poor fertilization of excess GIFT oocytes was also observed. Three intracytoplasmic sperm injection procedures were then performed. The first two were unsuccessful and the third ensued in a singleton pregnancy. Hormonal support (progesterone and estradriol valerate until 12 weeks pregnancy duration) was given. The pregnancy resulted in the normal delivery of a healthy male infant at full term.

40|$|BackgroundCombined {{hormonal}} contraceptives (CHCs) {{are popular}} methods of reversible contraception in the United States, but adherence remains an issue {{as reflected in}} their lower rates of typical use effectiveness. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate evidence {{on the effect of}} missed CHCs on pregnancy rates as well as surrogate measures of contraceptive effectiveness (e. g., ovulation, follicular development, changes in hormone levels, cervical mucus quality). Study DesignWe searched the PubMed database for peer-reviewed articles published in any language from database inception through April 2012. We included studies that examined measures of contraceptive effectiveness during cycles with extended hormone-free intervals or nonadherence (e. g., omission of pills, delayed patch replacement) on days not adjacent to the hormone-free interval. We used standard abstract forms and grading systems to summarize and assess the quality of the evidence. ResultsThe search strategy identified 1387 articles, of which 26 met our study selection criteria. There is wide variability in the amount of follicular development and risk of ovulation among women who extended the pill-free interval to 822 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 14 days; in general, the risk of ovulation was low, and among women who did ovulate, cycles were usually abnormal (i. e., low progesterone levels, small follicles and/or poor cervical mucus) (Level I, good, indirect to Level II- 3, fair, indirect). Studies of women who missed one to four consecutive pills or 122 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 3 consecutive days of delay before patch replacement at times other than adjacent to the hormone-free interval reported little follicular activity and low risk of ovulation (Level I, fair, indirect to Level II- 3, poor, indirect). Studies comparing 30 mcg versus 20 mcg mc ethinyl estradiol pills showed more follicular activity when 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol pills were missed (Level I, good, indirect). ConclusionMost of the studies in this evidence base relied on <b>surrogate</b> measures of <b>pregnancy</b> risk and ranged in quality. For studies providing indirect evidence on the effects of missed CHCs, it is unclear how differences in surrogate measures correspond to pregnancy risk. Fewer studies examined the transdermal patch and vaginal ring than combined oral contraceptives. CC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2015 - 02 - 10 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 23083527 PMC 432290...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Science and Values: Global Perspectives track. Analyses of migration and trafficking focus on the flow of persons from poorer to wealthier countries. In relation to health care, these accounts emphasize either the drain of resources from poorer countries, as skilled medical personnel migrate to developed economies, or the burden placed on developed economies by the immigration of disadvantaged populations. Medical tourism, in which the flow of persons is reversed, raises a different and even more critical set of ethical difficulties at the juncture of medicine, mobility, and justice. Typically, medical tourists travel from a wealthy country to a poorer one to obtain medical care at a substantially discounted rate. Agencies market package tours combining medical services in a hospital or clinic with convalescence in a hotel or resort style accommodation. Historically, medical tourism consisted largely of female patient/tourists seeking elective plastic surgeries at a discount. Recently, the numbers of patient/tourists traveling for organ transplants has surged. Reproductive services constitute a booming part of the industry. Bioethics rarely reflects on medical tourism; yet, annually, more than a million Americans alone travel as patient/tourists. Some conventional health insurance companies have begun to market package tours. A growing genre of private companies specializes in medical tourism, matching patients with providers, and arranging travel, accommodation, translation services, and recreational or tourist activities. Studies suggest that the marketing of medical tourism is even more advanced in the UK, than in the US. Health care analysts in the US predict that medical tourism will soon become a structurally integrated part of the delivery system, encouraged as a means of reducing costs. An operation costing $ 30 k in the US costs $ 6 k in Costa Rica, including recuperation on the beach. India’s first for-profit hospital promotes “First-World Health Care at Emerging Market Prices” to an international clientele. Some employers and insurance providers in the US are exploring medical tourism as a low-cost alternative to local care. The government of India, in conjunction with for-profit providers, is now actively pursuing a “subcontracting” relationship with the British National Health Service for the outsourcing of medical care, that is, for shipping British patients to India to receive care. Thus, medical tourism not only shifts resources within the “host” country, from the local population to profit-generating foreigners, but also threatens to undermine guarantees of care in the tourist’s home country. At the same time, countries in Asia, South America, and Eastern Europe have embraced medical tourism as a key element of economic development. In 2003, the Singapore Ministry of Health launched Singapore-Medicine, a “multi-agency government-industry partnership committed to promoting Singapore as a world-class destination for advanced patient care. ” Through Singapore-Medicine, the government’s Economic Development Board collaborates with its Tourism Board to “brand and market” Singapore’s health care services internationally. Singapore plans to attract 1 million medical tourists annually by 2012 and to become a major competitor to well-established markets in South Africa, Thailand, and South America. Recent amendments to Singapore’s Human Organ Transplant Act eliminated the prohibition against payments to living donors. Despite laws against organ trading, Singapore has engaged the worldwide advertising firm DDB to “handle all marketing and advertising communication for its Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA) campaign,” and is already attracting foreign clients. Following a similar strategy, the government of India actively promotes collaboration between for-profit health care providers and the tourism industry. Finance Minister Jaswant Singhi’s 2003 budget made the development of India as a “global health destination” official government policy. Medical tourism is frequently identified as India’s most important growth industry. India’s development policy for medical tourism specifically targets “reproductive outsourcing” as a key sector of economic growth. Surrogacy produces nearly $ 500 million a year in revenue in for-profit clinics. Under guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research, women recruited as surrogates, who are almost invariably poor and frequently illiterate, sign away, often with a thumbprint, any relation to the children they bear. Policies actively isolate the surrogates from both donors and clients, while children are immediately removed from the surrogate at birth. These practices insure the alienation of the surrogates from the social and generative aspects of pregnancy, reducing them to the status of rented wombs. Marketing strategies in the industry specifically contrast the conditions of surrogacy in the West with the practices of surveillance and confinement to which Indian surrogates are subjected. Frequently, surrogates are housed in hostels attached to for-profit medical clinics, where they are constantly monitored. Clinics advertise the regimens of exercise and diet and the “supervision” by medical personnel to which surrogates submit. One American client remarked, “[In the U. S. ] You have no idea if your surrogate mother is smoking, drinking alcohol, doing drugs. You don’t know what she’s doing. You have a third-party agency as a mediator between the two of you, but there’s no one policing her. ” The ethical difficulties of medical tourism arise from the exploitation of inequities of wealth and power, both between the home and “host” countries and within the “host” country itself. Efforts to employ medical tourism as a form of cost-containment in the US and Britain exemplify the exploitation of social inequity within the home country as well. These policies differentially aggravate the subjection of women, reinforcing their poverty and powerlessness, as well as their status as property. Policies that alienate the <b>surrogate</b> from <b>pregnancy</b> and birth, subject her to surveillance and discipline, and reduce her social relations to an economic calculus constitute a paradigm of the commodification of the body to benefit governmental power and wealth. Some argue that prohibiting or even criticizing payments to poor women in India who serve as surrogates constitutes paternalism, if not imperialism. This argument ignores the effect of these practices in reinforcing the very structural inequities of power and wealth that subject women in the first place. The collaboration of governmental power and economic privilege in the aggressive marketing of the wombs of poor women may provide an isolated, marginal economic gain for a particular woman, but it systematically secures and consolidates her status as property. Similarly, structural inequities are reinforced when medical tourists buy organs in poorer countries, just as gender inequities are intensified when medical tourists travel to Turkey to practice sex selection. My paper argues that medical tourism not only constitutes an “internal drain” on the “host” country’s health care system, comparable to the external drain of personnel and wealth due to immigration, but also that it depends on and reinforces structures of subjection, as well as the systematic disparities of wealth and power that they produce. Whatever wealth results from this industry, there is little, if any, evidence that it ameliorates existing economic and social inequities, while it clearly depends not only on the commodification of the body and the rendering of persons as property, but also on entrenched and historically determined inequities that differentially affect women...|$|R

Gay male couples might decide that they should both contribute semen for an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) process, which further establishes the couple's joint intention to become parents.

40|$|ANGEL FOR HIRE Directed & Produced by Mary Flynn and Nina Goodby Angel For Hire is a 26 -minute {{documentary}} that {{explores the}} power of the contract in surrogate motherhood arrangements, and the implications of signing away rights to your body in order to bear a child for a stranger. The film follows Angel Patwell through the final weeks of her second <b>surrogate</b> <b>pregnancy</b> as she struggles to turn a breach baby and faces the possibility of a contract- mandated caesarian section against her wishes. Angel and her ʻIntended Parents,ʼ Scott Schlichter and Deborah Grimes, all live in California, the premiere location of third-party reproduction for infertile couples around the world. Despite the industry's success in California, the legal protections around surrogacy remain largely unregulated. It is her contract that will ultimately determine the circumstances under which Angel will deliver the child she carries. Interwoven with verité footage of Angel, Deb and Scott, is the story of Noel Keane, a pioneering and controversial lawyer from Dearborn, Michigan who created the first contract for <b>surrogate</b> <b>pregnancy</b> in the late 1970 s. Keane was approached by a couple and asked to find a woman to be inseminated with the husbandʼs sperm, bear a child, and hand it over to them. At the time, the concept seemed outrageous, yet Keane took a chance and drew up the first “commercial” surrogacy agreement. Keane would become the most visible middleman in the world of surrogate parenting. He received much criticism for problem cases in several states, the most notorious of which was the 1986 Baby M case in New Jersey. The story of Baby M shocked the nation, hurtling into the national conversation the legal, moral and ethical issues involved with the practice of surrogacy. Despite the heated debate, Keane embraced the media as a way to advertise his unique field of law. We are currently in final month of editing, and the film is set to premiere in May 2011 at UC Berkeleyʼs Graduate School of Journalism. The historical portion of the film is for the most part told through archival television footage, and securing the rights and licensing for such footage, especially from major networks, becomes costly very quickly. As we approach completion of the film, we need $ 5000 to help us obtain rights to archival footage that will bring Noel Keane and the history of contracted surrogacy to life onscreen. We hope to show the film in festivals and on public television. By revisiting the nascent beginnings of this new field of law - surrogate parenting – we want viewers to walk away understanding how drastically the legal landscape has shifted towards making surrogacy available, and yet, {{how difficult it is to}} pin down a process where emotions are entwined with legal commitments.

However, low cloning efficiency limits the application of SCNT. In this study, we systematically investigated the major influencing factors related to the overall cloning efficiency in pigs. Here, 13620 cloned embryos derived from excellent pigs were transferred into 79 surrogate gilts, and 119 live cloned piglets were eventually generated. During cloning, group of cloned embryos derived from excellent Landrace or Large white pigs presented no significant differences of cleavage and blastocyst rates, blastocyst cell numbers, <b>surrogate</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and delivery rates, average numbers of piglets born and alive and cloning efficiencies, and group of 101 - 150, 151 - 200 or 201 - 250 cloned embryos transferred per surrogate also displayed a similar developmental efficiency. When estrus stage of surrogate gilts was compared, group of embryo transfer on Day 2 of estrus showed significantly higher pregnancy rate, delivery rate, average number of piglets born, average alive piglet number or cloning efficiency than group on Day 1, Day 3, Day 4 or Day 5, respectively (P< 0. 05). And, {{in comparison with the}} preovulation and postovulation groups, group of surrogate gilts during periovulation displayed a significantly higher overall cloning efficiency (P< 0. 05). Further investigation of surrogate estrus stage and ovulation status displayed that ovulation status was the real factor underlying estrus stage to determine the overall cloning efficiency. And more, follicle puncture for preovulation, not transfer position shallowed for preovulation or deepened for postovulation, significantly improved the average number of piglets alive and cloning efficiency (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, our results demonstrated that ovulation status of surrogate gilts was the fundamental factor determining the overall cloning efficiency of excellent pigs, and follicle puncture, not transfer position change, improved cloning efficiency.

40|$|In {{the first}} decades of the twentieth century, the study of human {{heredity}} consisted of the applied science of eugenics and the theoretical science of genetics. Geneticists studied the mechanisms of heredity, while eugenicists sought to apply this knowledge to manage society. Surrogacy is an arrangement where a woman agrees to become pregnant and deliver a child for a contracted party. She may be the child’s genetic mother (the more traditional form of surrogacy), or she may, as a ‘carrier’, carry the pregnancy to delivery after having been implanted with an embryo, the latter being an illegal medical procedure in some jurisdictions. Surrogacy or Surrogate means substitute. In medical terminology, surrogacy indicates an arrangement whereby a woman agrees to undergo the pregnancy, labor, and delivery for another individual who either cannot through artificial insemination or surgical implantation of a fertilized ovum or embryo, or chooses not to. In gestational surrogacy (Host method), a female host is implanted with an embryo that is not her own, and becomes pregnant with a child to which she is not the biological mother. After birth, the gestational carrier turns over the child to the biological mother and/or father to raise, or to the adoptive parent(s) (in which case, the embryo would have been a donated embryo). Commercial surrogacy is a form of surrogacy in which a gestational carrier is paid to carry a child to maturity in her womb and is usually resorted to by well-off couples who can afford the cost involved or people who save or borrow in order to complete their dream of being parents. The intended parents may arrange a <b>surrogate</b> <b>pregnancy</b> because of female infertility, or other medical issues which may make the pregnancy or delivery risky. The intended mother could also be fertile and healthy, and prefer the convenience of someone else undergoing pregnancy, labor, and delivery for her. The intended parent could also be a single male wishing to have his own biological child, or a single woman who is unable to bring a pregnancy to full term. Some homosexual male couples also turn to surrogacy as an option to becoming parents In France, since 1994 any surrogacy arrangement that is commercial or altruistic is illegal or unlawful and sanctioned by the law (art 16 - 7 du code civil). genetic identity, surrogacy, intended parent, surrogacy arrangement...|$|E
40|$|A tecnologia e a ciência médica aplicada tem criado as condições para tornar possível que casais inférteis, antes condenados a não ter filhos pelos meios biológicos usuais, hoje alcancem este objetivo. Os formidáveis progressos científicos com a reprodução medicamente assistida, num primeiro momento, permitiram superar a infertilidade causada por ovulação insuficiente ou um número pequeno de espermatozóides com a fertilização in vitro. Num segundo momento, depois de gerado o embrião, implanta-lo no útero materno e, finalmente, conseguir a sua implantação em outro útero que não o da dona do embrião gerado em laboratório. Neste estágio - a gravidez de substituição - tem gerado inúmeros questionamentos de ordem ética e religiosa e jurídica. Se de um lado a lei já tem uma visão relativamente pacificada - dentro da ótica da estrutura {{familiar}} vigente - e os fóruns éticos já tenham definido deontologicamente os passos deste processo, o campo religioso continua postando-se de maneira contrária e com uma abertura muito estreita para discussões sobre o tema. No maior país católico do mundo, no entanto, muitos casais - mesmo sabendo estar contrariando normas explicitadas por documentos eclesiásticos - têm buscado, cada vez mais, este recurso que a ciência lhes põe a disposição. Applied {{medical science}} and technology have now created the conditions where {{it is possible for}} infertile couples, who would previously have been condemned not to have children by the usual biological means, to achieve this objective. First, stunning scientific advances in medically assisted reproduction have made it possible to overcome infertility arising from insufficient ovulation or low sperm-count by way of in vitro fertilization. Secondly, the embryo thus produced can now be implanted in another woman´s uterus. This <b>surrogate</b> <b>pregnancy</b> has given rise to a number of ethical, religious and legal questions. On the one hand, the law has a relatively benign view of this practice-so long as it remains {{within the context of the}} conventional family structure. Likewise ethics has already marked out the stages in this process. Religious leaders, however, remain deeply opposed and unwilling to enter into dialogue on the issue. Although Brazil is the largest Catholic country in the world, increasing numbers of couples in this country are taking advantage of this new scientific resource, even though they are aware that it conflicts with official religious doctrine. Bioethical debate of this issue has only recently begun and needs to bear in mind the extent to which reproductive technology involves new groups who are not covered by the classical definition of the nuclear family...|$|E
