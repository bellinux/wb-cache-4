40|$|A rapid {{system of}} {{sampling}} for <b>strawberry</b> <b>aphids,</b> Chaetosiphonfragaefolii (Cockerell) {{was developed for}} use by pest management scouts. Regression equations relating mean numbers of aphids/leaf, variances of those means {{and the proportion of}} unifested leaves (Po) were developed from samples of aphids from single leaves. Using the equations, mean aphid density per leaf and standard errors can be estimated from Po and the sample size. The accuracy of the estimations were tested on data from 155 samples from commercial strawberry fields sampled by a professional pest management company. Means estimated from Po were sufficiently accurate for the intended purpose and only 2 hours were required to sample 300 leaves compared to 16 hours when all aphids on all leaves were counted from only 80 leaves. An electronic recorder was programmed to prompt an IPM scout for data entry, allow correction of errors and permit sampling from different subplots within a field...|$|R
40|$|Off season high tunnel {{strawberry}} {{production has}} the potential to augment income for Arkansas fruit growers during an unproductive time of the year, however management guidelines do not exist. At the University of Arkansas Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Fayetteville, AR studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of four nitrogen (46 - 0 - 0 urea fertilizer) fertigation rates (0. 75, 0. 50, 0. 25, 0. 0 kg N/day/ha) and red or black colored plastic mulch films on densities of twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae), numbers of parasitized cotton aphids, and fruit yield weight. Foliar and petiole nitrogen content were evaluated in nitrogen fertigation trials. In the nitrogen fertigation experiment twospotted spider mites, cotton aphids and parasitized cotton aphids were sampled from the younger and older leaves of strawberry plants. Cowpeas, Vigna unguiculata L. Walp. (Fabales: Fabaceae), were planted and incorporated into the soil to supplement available nitrogen. Nitrogen fertigation treatments did not have the expected effect on foliar or petiole nitrogen levels. Preplanting nitrogen levels due to the cover crop of cowpeas, may have been provided sufficient nitrogen to the strawberry plants {{for the duration of the}} experiment to nullify the effect of the nitrogen treatments. Therefore, any significant differences in strawberry fruit yield, twospotted spider mite, cotton aphid, or parasitized aphid numbers would not be attributable to nitrogen fertigation treatments, and none were found. There were no significant differences among nitrogen fertilization treatments in the numbers of twospotted spider mites on the younger or older leaves except for one sample date, 8 January. However there were significantly more cotton aphids and parasitized cotton aphids in the older leaves compared to the younger leaves. There were no significant differences in strawberry fruit yield, twospotted spider mite, cotton aphid, or parasitized cotton aphids in the red or black plastic mulch experiment, although lack of sufficient replication limited results. Future experiments may compare interaction effects of several high tunnel plastic film covers with different light transmitting characteristics and different color mulches on <b>strawberry</b> yields and <b>aphid</b> and mite densities inside high tunnels versus in open fields...|$|R

Breeding of genotypes resistant to this pest is an important preventivecontrol measure, which can be compatible with rational insecticide application. The aimof the paper was to determine effects of dimethoate and deltamethrin on C. fragaefoliipopulations reared on two strawberry genotypes different in susceptibility: susceptiblestrawberry cultivar Čačanska rana and medium resistant hybrid, zf/ 1 / 94 / 96 (Senga Fructarinax Del Norte).

40|$|Seasonal {{abundance}} of the <b>strawberry</b> <b>aphid</b> complex under different agronomic {{practices in the}} outskirts of La Plata, Argentina was studied on strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne (Rosales: Rosaceae). Aphid densities were low in strawberry fields in which insecticides and fungicides were used. In addition to Aphis gossypii, Aphis fabae, Mysus persicae and Macrosiphum euphorbiae, the aphid, Chaetosiphon fragaefolii (Cockerell) (Homoptera: Aphididae), was recorded {{for the first time}} in this horticultural area. Life history and some demographic parameters were calculated for C. fragaefolii. The mean duration of nymphal stages was 10. 44 days, the oviposition period was 11. 8 days, and the mean number of nymph/female/day was 2. 4 ± 0. 3. Demographic parameters analyzed included the net reproductive rate Ro = 14. 55 ± 0. 096 nymph/female, generation time T= 16. 91 ± 0. 035 days, and the intrinsic rate of increase rm = 0. 158 ± (0. 004). No parasites were found associated with C. fragaefolli. The pathogenic fungus, Entomophthora planchoniana Cornu (Zygomycetes: Entomophthorales) was the main mortality factor. Although aphids are not the main pests in strawberry fields, C. fragaefolii can be a serious problem because it can transmit several virus diseases of strawberry. Greater knowledge of life history traits and mortality factors of this species is needed in order to design appropriate control strategies...|$|E
40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{assessed}} {{the risk to}} plant health of Strawberry crinkle virus (SCV) for the European Union (EU) territory, and evaluated the current EU legislation and possible risk reduction options. This virus is widely distributed {{both within and outside}} Europe and the same applies to its main vector, the <b>strawberry</b> <b>aphid,</b> Chaetosiphon fragaefolii. At-risk hosts (Fragaria spp.) occur widely in Europe. Plants for planting were identified as the most significant entry pathway and the probability of entry is rated as unlikely to moderately likely with high uncertainty. The probability of establishment is rated as very likely with low uncertainty. The probability of local spread by natural means is moderately likely, with high uncertainty, whereas that of human-assisted long-distance spread is unlikely, with medium uncertainty. The potential consequences are rated as minimal to minor with medium uncertainty. Prohibition and restricting import or intra-EU trade to certified materials or to materials originating from pest-free areas or pest-free places of production are the options with highest effectiveness against the risks of introduction or against the risks of further spread. Prohibition and certification are also among the options of high or very high feasibility. In addition, {{it should be noted that}} the combination of options (cultural practices, certification, exclusion conditions, tolerant varieties) has an overall high to very high level of effectiveness and feasibility. The current legislation has few weaknesses: the reliance on visual inspection, as well as the exceptions or derogations offered to some countries in which SCV is present. If the current legislation were removed, no major consequences would be expected unless the industry simultaneously ceased its widely adopted certification activity, which seems unlikely given the potential consequence...|$|E
