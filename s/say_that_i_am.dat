I accept it more particularly as {{it comes from a}} colored lady, for if there is any one on God's earth who loves the ladies I believe it is myself. (Immense applause and laughter.) This day is a day that is proud to me, having occupied the position that I did for the past twelve years, and been misunderstood by your race. This is the first opportunity I have had during that time to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> your friend. I am here a representative of the southern people, one more slandered and maligned than any man in the nation.|$|E
500|$|Dicen Que Soy (They <b>Say</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am)</b> is {{the third}} studio album by Puerto Rican-American {{recording}} artist La India released on September 20, 1994 by RMM Records. The album was produced by American musician Sergio George, who chose the songs for India to record {{with an emphasis on}} feminism to suit with her voice. The production mixes salsa music with other rhythms such as funk and timba. Five singles were released from the record with [...] "Nunca Voy a Olvidarte" [...] and [...] "Ese Hombre" [...] topping the Billboard Tropical Songs chart.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Crane's {{fiction is}} {{typically}} categorized {{as representative of}} Naturalism, American realism, Impressionism or a mixture of the three. [...] Critic Sergio Perosa, for example, wrote in his essay, [...] "Stephen Crane fra naturalismo e impressionismo," [...] that the work presents a [...] "symbiosis" [...] of Naturalistic ideals and Impressionistic methods. [...] When asked {{whether or not he}} would write an autobiography in 1896, Crane responded that he [...] "dare not <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> honest. [...] I merely <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> as nearly honest as a weak mental machinery will allow." [...] Similarities between the stylistic techniques in Crane's writing and Impressionist painting—including the use of color and chiaroscuro—are often cited to support the theory that Crane was not only an Impressionist but also influenced by the movement. [...] H. G. Wells remarked upon [...] "the great influence of the studio" [...] on Crane's work, quoting a passage from The Red Badge of Courage as an example: [...] "At nightfall the column broke into regimental pieces, and the fragments went into the fields to camp. Tents sprang up like strange plants. Camp fires, like red, peculiar blossoms, dotted the night.... From this little distance the many fires, with the black forms of men passing to and fro before the crimson rays, made weird and satanic effects." [...] Although no direct evidence exists that Crane formulated a precise theory of his craft, he vehemently rejected sentimentality, asserting that [...] "a story should be logical in its action and faithful to character. [...] Truth to life itself was the only test, the greatest artists were the simplest, and simple because they were true." ...|$|E
5000|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. {{often used}} the phrase [...] "drum major {{instinct}}," [...] meaning the instinct to be a leader. In his sermon at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, on February 4, 1968 he said: [...] "If you want to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for justice, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for peace, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for righteousness. And {{all of the other}} shallow things will not matter... I just want to leave a committed life behind." ...|$|R

500|$|Harington was {{nominated}} for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the role in 2016. He said, [...] "It is a serious understatement to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> somewhat stunned ... For my work on Game of Thrones to be recognized in this way is an emotional moment for me. I could not be more humbled." [...] Harington was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television for the role in 2012, 2016, and 2017. His other nominations include the Golden Nymph Award for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series in 2012, the Young Hollywood Award for Actor of the Year in 2013, and the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2016. IGN also nominated Jon Snow as its Best TV Hero in 2011.|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, {{speculation}} arose {{that group}} member Amelle Berrabah {{had left the}} Sugababes following reports of tension with band member Keisha Buchanan. However, it was announced on 21 September 2009 that Buchanan, the sole original member of the group, had officially left the Sugababes. Buchanan clarified the departure on her official Twitter account, writing: [...] "I'm sad to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> no longer {{a part of the}} Sugababes ... Although it was not my choice to leave, it's time to enter a new chapter in my life ... Sometimes a breakdown in communication and lack of trust can result in many different things." [...] Buchanan was replaced by former Eurovision contestant Jade Ewen. As a result of the line-up change, [...] "Wear My Kiss" [...] was re-recorded for the inclusion of vocals from new member Ewen and the removal of vocals from Buchanan.|$|E
500|$|A general {{election}} {{was called in}} Southern Rhodesia in July 1948 after the United Party government, headed by the Prime Minister Sir Godfrey Huggins, unexpectedly lost {{a vote in the}} Legislative Assembly. In August, about a month before election day, Smith was approached by members of the opposition Liberal Party and asked to stand for them in Selukwe. Jacob Smit's Liberals, despite their name, were decidedly illiberal, chiefly representing commercial farming, mining and industrial interests. Smith was initially reluctant, saying he was too busy organising his life to stand, but agreed after one of the Liberal officials suggested that a political career might allow him to defend the values he had fought for in the Second World War. With their wedding barely a fortnight away, Janet was astonished to learn of Smith's decision to run for parliament, having never before heard him discuss politics. [...] "I can't <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> really interested in party politics," [...] Smith explained to her, [...] "but I've always been most interested in sound government." [...] Smith duly became a Liberal Party politician, finalised his purchase of Gwenoro, and married Janet, adopting her two children as his own, all in a few weeks in August 1948. They enjoyed a few days' honeymoon at Victoria Falls, then went straight into the election campaign.|$|E

Jesus then asks his disciples about their own opinion: But who do you <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am?</b> Only Simon Peter answers him: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to Albert's marriage, {{there was}} much {{discussion}} of his continual bachelor status. Although he had received much press attention for dating well-known fashion models and actresses, his apparent disinclination to marry gave rise to rumours that he was homosexual. Prince Albert has consistently denied suggestions of homosexuality, most notably in a 1994 interview published in the French magazine Madame Figaro. [...] "At first it was amusing", he said, [...] "but it becomes very irritating {{in the long term}} to hear people <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> homosexual". In July 2011, Prince Albert married Charlene Wittstock.|$|E

2500|$|One {{of the two}} quotes {{appearing}} on the Stone of Hope and attributed to King, [...] "I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness", is a paraphrased version of King's actual words, which were: [...] "If you want to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for justice. <b>Say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for peace. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for righteousness. And {{all of the other}} shallow things will not matter." [...] The Washington Posts Rachel Manteuffel noticed the change and publicized it in an August 25, 2011 column, arguing that the revised quote misrepresented both King himself and the meaning of the 1968 sermon from which it was taken, in which King imagined the sort of eulogy he might receive.|$|R

2500|$|Verbs {{have six}} persons (three {{singular}} and three plural), various voices (active and passive, reflexive, reciprocal, and causative), {{and a large}} number of tenses. Meanings such as [...] "not", [...] "be able", [...] "must" [...] and [...] "if", which are expressed as separate words in most European languages, are usually expressed with verbal suffixes in Turkish. A characteristic of Turkish which is shared by neighboring languages such as Bulgarian and Persian is that the perfect tense suffix (in Turkish -miş-, -müş-, -mış-, or -muş-) often has an inferential meaning, e.g. geliyormuşum [...] "it would seem (they <b>say)</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> coming".|$|E

The short explanation for my absence is that I need to rest my voice for a few weeks. We are lucky that our good friend Paul Manzi is able to step in, and Tony knows the role of bass player/singer, so the shows can go ahead, and they will be great! I look forward to being back on stage very soon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dirac's {{quantum electrodynamics}} (QED) made {{predictions}} that were – {{more often than}} not – infinite and therefore unacceptable. A workaround known as renormalisation was developed, but Dirac never accepted this. [...] "I must <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very dissatisfied with the situation", he said in 1975, [...] "because this so-called 'good theory' does involve neglecting infinities which appear in its equations, neglecting them in an arbitrary way. This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it is small – not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and you do not want it!" [...] His refusal to accept renormalisation resulted in his work on the subject moving increasingly out of the mainstream.|$|E

[...] Martin said that [...] "these years in silence and reflection made me stronger and reminded me that acceptance {{has to come from}} within and that this kind of truth gives me the power to conquer emotions I didn't even know existed."

And yet, Rosecrans displayed similar caution, remaining in Nashville while he reprovisioned his army and improved the training of his cavalry forces. By early December 1862, General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck had lost his patience. He wrote to Rosecrans, [...] "If you remain one more week in Nashville, I cannot prevent your removal."
