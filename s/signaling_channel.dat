40|$|For 3 -D {{ultrasound}} imaging, the row-column addressing (RCA) with 2 N connections for an N × N 2 -D array {{makes the}} fabrication and interconnection simpler than the fully addressing with N 2 connections. However, RCA degrades the image quality because of defocusing in <b>signal</b> <b>channel</b> {{direction in the}} transmit event. To solve this problem, a split row-column addressing scheme (SRCA) is proposed in this paper. Rather than connecting all the elements in the <b>signal</b> <b>channel</b> direction together, this scheme divides the elements in the <b>signal</b> <b>channel</b> direction into several disconnected blocks, thus enables focusing beam access in both <b>signal</b> <b>channel</b> and switch channel directions. Selecting an appropriate split scheme is the key for SRCA to maintaining a reasonable tradeoff between the image quality {{and the number of}} connections. Various split schemes for a 32 × 32 array are fully investigated with point spread function (PSF) analysis and imaging simulation. The result shows the split scheme with five blocks (4, 6, 12, 6, and 4 elements of each block) can provide similar image quality to fully addressing. The splitting schemes for different array sizes from 16 × 16 to 96 × 96 are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The first {{generation}} of the Canadian Mobile Satellite (MSAT) system, planned to be operational in the early 1990 s, will provide voice and data services to land, aeronautical, and maritime mobile terminals within the Canadian land mass and its territorial waters. The system will be managed by a centralized Demand Assignment Multiple Access (DAMA) control system. Users will request a communication channel by communicating with the DAMA Control System (DCS) via the appropriate <b>signalling</b> <b>channels.</b> Several access techniques for both L-band and SHF <b>signalling</b> <b>channels</b> have been investigated. For the L-band, Slotted Aloha (SA) and Reservation Aloha (RA), combined with a token scheme, are discussed here. The results of Telesat studies to date indicate that SA, when combined with token scheme, provides the most efficient access and resource management tool in a mobile propagation environment. For SHF <b>signalling</b> <b>channels,</b> slim time division multiple access (TDMA) and SA have been considered as the most suitable candidate schemes. In view of the operational environment of the SHF links, provision of a very short channel access delay and a relatively high packet success rate are highly desirable.

Server and Agent based Active network Management (SAAM) introduces a novel network architecture that provides guaranteed quality of services to real-time traffic. In SAAM, the server and routers need to establish two-way, robust, and efficient <b>signaling</b> <b>channels</b> for exchange of control and management information. Any change in network topology must be determined and handled as they occur {{in order to support}} guaranteed services. Local detection of topological changes and hop-by- hop dissemination of knowledge of these changes is not optimal for SAAM architecture. A reactive method of updating routing tables takes longer time than tolerable for real-time traffic. Therefore, a pro-active approach that reconfigures the <b>signaling</b> <b>channels</b> in real time and without degrading services to user traffic is mandatory.
