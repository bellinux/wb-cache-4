An alternating magnetic field beneath the <b>slide</b> <b>surface</b> interacts with a steel plate {{mounted on the}} underside of each boat to push them uphill smoothly and quickly.

In that case, all of the boats throughout the course will roll back, causing each boat to valley at the bottom of a hill. LIM technology is commonly used on launched roller coasters.|$|E

40|$|Weak {{structural}} {{surface is}} one of the key factors controlling the stability of slopes. The stability of rock slopes is in general concerned with set of discontinuities. However, in soft rocks, failure can occur along surfaces approaching to a circular failure surface. To better understand the position of potential <b>sliding</b> <b>surface,</b> a new method called simplex-finite stochastic tracking method is proposed. This method basically divides <b>sliding</b> <b>surface</b> into two parts: one is described by smooth curve obtained by random searching, the other one is polyline formed by the weak structural surface.

This debris built a dam for Vorderrhein and created a lake in the Ilanz area. The level of the lake was found to have been at a maximum of 840 m above sea level which results in a length of the lake of some 10 mi.|$|E

40|$|The Frequency-Shaped <b>Sliding</b> <b>Surface</b> Control (FSSSC) {{has been}} {{recently}} {{applied to the}} Active Vibration Isolation System (AVIS) and the robust skyhook performance is experimentally validated. However, the performance {{of this approach is}} theoretically limited by the sensor dynamics. This paper generalizes the FSSSC approach as a two-step AVIS control design method. The first step is to design the <b>sliding</b> <b>surface</b> which determines the designed performances. The second step is to design the regulator which guarantees the convergence of the system dynamics. As long as this convergence is guaranteed, the designed performances would be realized. The vibration isolation of the original plant is therefore transformed to the regulation of a new system which is composed of the original plant and the <b>sliding</b> <b>surface.</b> As the regulator design has been well studied in the literature, this paper focuses on the <b>sliding</b> <b>surface</b> design. An example <b>sliding</b> <b>surface</b> design to achieve low-frequency vibration isolation is provided.

Dilute cell suspensions existing in a dilute medium are best suited for the preparation of cytospins through cytocentrifugation.

The constant among these preparations is that the whole cell is present on the <b>slide</b> <b>surface.</b> For any intercellular reaction to take place, immunoglobulin must first traverse the cell membrane that is intact in these preparations.

Analogues of three monosaccharide neoglycoconjugates, with two common linkers each, were included in the test group to evaluate the linker effect on lectin recognition.

40|$|The basal <b>sliding</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{in large}} rockslides are often {{composed}} of several surfaces and possess a complex geometry. The exact morphology and location {{in three dimensions}} of the <b>sliding</b> <b>surface</b> remains generally unknown, in spite of extensive field and subsurface investigations, such as those at the Åknes rockslide (western Norway). This knowledge is crucial for volume estimations, failure mechanisms, and numerical slope stability modeling. This paper focuses on the geomorphologic characterization of the basal <b>sliding</b> <b>surface</b> of a postglacial rockslide scar {{in the vicinity of}} Åknes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Molecular barcode arrays {{provide a}} {{powerful}} means to analyze cellular phenotypes in parallel through detection of short (20 - 60 base) unique sequence tags, or "barcodes", {{associated with each}} strain or clone in a collection. However, costs of current methods for microarray construction, whether by in situ oligonucleotide synthesis or ex situ coupling of modified oligonucleotides to the <b>slide</b> <b>surface</b> are often prohibitive to large-scale analyses. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate that unmodified 20 mer oligonucleotide probes printed on conventional surfaces show comparable hybridization signals to covalently linked 5 '-amino-modified probes. As a test case, we undertook systematic cell size analysis of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome-wide deletion collection by size separation of the deletion pool followed by determination of strain abundance in size fractions by barcode arrays. We demonstrate that the properties of a 13 K unique feature spotted 20 mer oligonucleotide barcode microarray compare favorably with an analogous covalently-linked oligonucleotide array. Further, cell size profiles obtained with the size selection/barcode array approach recapitulate previous cell size measurements of individual deletion strains. Finally, through atomic force microscopy (AFM), we characterize the mechanism of hybridization to unmodified barcode probes on the <b>slide</b> <b>surface.</b> CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These studies push the lower limit of probe size in genome-scale unmodified oligonucleotide microarray construction and demonstrate a versatile, cost-effective and reliable method for molecular barcode analysis...|$|E
