40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn {{radiation}} therapy, {{the peripheral}} dose (PD) – the dose outside the geometric {{boundaries of the}} radiation field – is of clinical importance. A metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) detector is used to estimate the peripheral dose. AimThe {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the ability of a MOSFET dosimetry system to accurately measure doses in peripheral regions of high energy X-ray beams. Materials & MethodsThe accuracy of the MOSFET system is evaluated by comparing peripheral region dose measurement with the results of <b>standard</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> measurements. Furthermore, the measurement of PD using a MOSFET detector helps us to keep the tolerance dose of any critical organ closer to the treatment field within the acceptable limits. The measurements were carried out using a 0. 6 cc Farmer type ionization chamber and MOSFET 20 dosimetry system for field sizes ranging from 5 × 5 cm 2 to 20 × 20 cm 2 at three depths of 1. 5 cm, 5 cm and 10 cm in a blue water phantom. PD were measured at distances varying from 1 cm to 30 cm from the field edges along the x axis for the open fields, with collimator rotation and with beam modifiers like 15 degree, 30 degree and 45 degree wedges. ResultsThe results show a good agreement of measured dose by both methods for various field sizes, collimator rotation and wedges.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{detector}} {{size in the}} broadening of the penumbra on the model in the Pinnacle RTPS is investigated. A second order polynomial was devised to correlate the source size parameter with the RTPS-calculated penumbra. The optimal source size parameter was calculated for penumbra measurements based on the diamond detector and a <b>standard</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> (IC). This work was done for Jaw fields, MLC fields with a leaf end radius of 8 cm, and MLC fields with a leaf end radius of 12 cm. The optimum source size of the 8 cm MLC fields matched the jaw fields, and an average (based on field sizes studied) of 1. 1 mm for the diamond detector data and 2. 4 mm for the ionization chamber was established. The effect of this overestimation of the source size parameter based on detector-induced penumbra broadening was considered for a clinical IMRT prostate plan by using two models (diamond and IC). There were differences in the DVH of the PTV and of OARs but these effects were of negligible clinical significance. Dose difference distributions showed dose difference areas to be in penumbra regions of the segments, with larger dose differences where penumbras intersected and/or {{there was a significant}} weighting on the segment.

40|$|In {{external}} photon beam therapies, {{the technique}} of dynamic wedge is a well established method for dose inhomogeneity compensation. The introduction of the enhanced dynamic wedge (EDW) on Varian LINACs considerably improved the pre-existing techniques. In the process of commissioning a Varian LINAC into a PINNACLE 3 treatment planning system (TPS), the user is required to import quite a few measurements of EDW profiles and percentage depth doses (PDDs). Standard measurement devices like ionization chambers in a water phantom are not the most indicated ones for this situation where each measurement point is obtained by integrating during the entire exposure: Measurements would result {{to be a very}} laborious and time consuming operation, most of the times not practically possible. The goal of the present work is to introduce an alternative and hands-on procedure to perform the measurements using a combination of Gafchromic™ EBT films, irradiated sideways in one single shot for both profiles and PDDs, and a single <b>standard</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber.</b> The scanned profiles obtained at different depths have easily been imported in the TPS; for the PDD measurements, a correction was proven necessary to account for a “self-shielding” effect introduced by the presence of the films themselves, when irradiated sideways, resulting in an underestimation of the dose at deeper depths. A correction curve was derived comparing TPS open field validated measurements with the curves extracted from Gafchromic™ EBT films. Finally, the curve was applied to all the wedged fields PDD measurements and could minimize the errors. The comparison for the 15 MV photon beam between the measured and the calculated 48 profiles and 12 PDDs (field sizes from 5 × 5 to 20 × 20 cm 2, wedge angles ranging from 15 ° to 60 °) was acceptable. The confidence limit (CL) was used as fit indicator, as suggested by the ESTRO Booklet No. 7 : For the investigated PDDs the maximum value was 6. 40 in the build up region and 2. 83 beyond the maximum dose point; regarding cross beam profiles, the CLs were below 3 for 85 % of the points within the field and for 96 % of the points outside the field; in the penumbra region, a more appropriate parameter to evaluate the agreement between calculated and measured doses is the distance to agreement; only 73 % of the profiles had CLs below 15, but for the remaining ones, distance-to-agreement values were within 3 mm. A hundred ionization chamber point dose measurements (for square and elongated fields at different depth and for points in field and out of field) were performed in a water phantom and 98 of them confirmed the TPS calculations with differences lower than 3 % and considerably lower in most of the cases. This article gives valuable guidance and insight to other physicists attempting to approach EDW commissioning in the PINNACLE TPS software using Gafchromic™ EBT films...|$|E

The hand dose distribution study was performed both by using thermo-luminescent detector measurements and Monte Carlo simulations. The validated simulation tool provides a new perspective for detailed investigations of CT-irradiation scenarios. Simulations show that there is a strong dose gradient, namely the even zones of the hand that are in precise vicinity to the x-ray beam only receive about 4 % of the maximum dose delivered to adjacent areas which are directly exposed to the primary x-ray beam.

40|$|More than {{hundred years}} after the {{discovery}} of X-rays different kinds of ionizing radiation are ubiquitous in medicine, applied to clinical diagnostics and cancer treatment as well. Irrespective of their nature, the widespread application of radiation implies its precise dosimetric characterization and detailed knowledge of the radiobiological effects induced in cancerous and normal tissue. Starting with in vitro cell irradiation experiments, which define basic parameters for the subsequent tissue and animal studies, the whole multi-stage process is completed by clinical trials that translate the results of fundamental research into clinical application. In this context, the present dissertation focuses on the establishment of radiobiological in vitro cell experiments at unconventional, but clinical relevant radiation qualities. In {{the first part of}} the present work the energy dependent biological effectiveness of photons was studied examining low-energy X-rays (≤ 50 keV), as used for mammography, and high-energy photons (≥ 20 MeV) as proposed for future radiotherapy. Cell irradiation experiments have been performed at conventional X-ray tubes providing low-energy photons and 200 kV reference radiation as well. In parallel, unconventional quasi-monochromatic channeling X-rays and high-energy bremsstrahlung available at the radiation source ELBE of the Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf were considered for radiobiological experimentation. For their precise dosimetric characterization dosimeters based on the thermally stimulated emission of exoelectrons and on radiochromic films were evaluated, whereas just the latter was found to be suitable for the determination of absolute doses and spatial dose distributions at cell position. <b>Standard</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> were deployed for the online control of cell irradiation experiments. Radiobiological effects were analyzed in human mammary epithelial cells on different subcellular levels revealing an increasing amount of damage for decreasing photon energy. For this reason, the assumed photon energy dependence was reconfirmed for a cell line other than human lymphocytes, an important finding that was discussed on the 2007 Retreat of the German Commission on Radiological Protection. After successful finalization of the photon experiments the focus of the present dissertation was directed to the realization of in vitro cell irradiation experiments with laser-accelerated electrons. This research was carried out in the frame of the project onCOOPtics that aims on the development of laser-based particle accelerators, which promise accelerators of potentially compact size and more cost-effectiveness suitable for a widespread medical application, especially for high precision hadron therapy. The unique properties, i. e., the ultrashort bunch length and resultant ultrahigh pulse dose rate, of these unconventional particle accelerators demand for extensive investigations with respect to potential effects on the dosimetric and radiobiological characterization. Based on the experiences gained at ELBE first experiments on the radiobiological characterization of laser-accelerated electrons have been performed at the Jena Titanium:Sapphire laser system. After beam optimization, a sophisticated dosimetry system was established that allow for the online control of the beam parameters and for the controlled delivery of dose to the cell sample. Finally, worldwide first systematic in vitro cell irradiation experiments were carried out resulting in a reduced biological effectiveness for laser-accelerated electrons relative to the 200 kV X-ray reference, irrespectively on the biological effect and cell lines examined. These successful results are the basis for future in vivo studies and experiments with laser-accelerated protons...|$|R

50|$|This is {{a survey}} meter with a twist. Similar to the CDV-715, the CDV-720 is a fixed-position <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> survey meter. Unlike any other survey meter, however, this unit has a movable beta shield {{on the bottom}} of the unit for {{detecting}} high levels of beta radiation. When slid to the open position, beta particles are allowed to directly penetrate the <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber.</b> With the beta shield closed, only gamma rays can penetrate both the shield and <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber.</b> This meter reads from 1R/h to 500R/h (X1, X10, and X100 scales).|$|R
40|$|The {{calibration}} {{of different}} types of <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> in radiotherapy level is done using different beam qualities i. e. {gamma}-rays from 137 Cs and 60 Co. The most common reference beam quality (Qo) used for the calibration of <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> in therapy level is 60 Co {gamma}-rays to calculate calibration coefficient factor either in air (NK) or water (ND,W). In this study we determine NK for two types of <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> PTW- 30013 and NE- 2561 in beam quality (Q) of 137 Cs. The reference values of NK for <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> type M- 32002 which determine in beam qualities Q and Qo were 24. 8 {mu}Gy/nC and 25. 4 {mu}Gy/nC respectively. These values were used to determine the NK and ND,W for unknown chambers in beam quality Q. The beam quality correction factor KQQo in terms of air and absorbed dose to water for different <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> used was 0. 980 ± 0. 01, 0. 983 ± 0. 009 and 1. 0001 ± 0. 008, 1. 0005 ± 0. 006 for TM- 30013 and NPL 229 respectively. </p...|$|R
