5|$|Pterobranchs {{may be a}} {{sub-group}} of enteropneusts ("acorn worms"). This {{suggests that}} the ancestral deuterostome {{looks more like a}} mobile worm-like enteropneust than a <b>sessile</b> colonial pterobranch. The fact that lophophorates and pterobranchs both use tentacles for feeding is probably not a synapomorphy of lophophorates and deuterostomes, but evolved independently as convergent adaptations to a <b>sessile</b> lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Stauromedusae, small <b>sessile</b> cnidarians with stalks and no medusa stage, have {{traditionally}} been classified {{as members of the}} Scyphozoa, but recent research suggests they should be regarded as a separate class, Staurozoa.|$|E
5|$|The main {{species of}} trees in the woods include English oak, <b>sessile</b> oak, hornbeam, beech, silver birch, wild service tree, aspen, rowan, field maple, crack willow, wild cherry, hazel and holly.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{elliptical}} or , smooth, translucent (hyaline), with {{dimensions of}} 4.5–5.5 by 2–2.5µm. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, {{are attached to}} 6–8 <b>sessile</b> spores.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) {{mucilaginous}} glands and <b>sessile</b> (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. P. moranensis can bend its leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The <b>sessile</b> glands, which lie flat on the leaf surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the <b>sessile</b> glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the leaf surface.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians {{were for}} a long time grouped with Ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata, but {{increasing}} awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four main classes: <b>sessile</b> Anthozoa (sea anemones, corals, sea pens); swimming Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies); and Hydrozoa, a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both <b>sessile</b> members such as Hydra and colonial swimmers such as the Portuguese Man o' War. Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa are now recognized as highly derived cnidarians rather than more closely related to the bilaterians.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians were {{formerly}} grouped with ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata, but increasing {{awareness of}} their differences caused them {{to be placed in}} separate phyla. Cnidarians are classified into four main groups: the almost wholly <b>sessile</b> Anthozoa (sea anemones, corals, sea pens); swimming Scyphozoa (jellyfish); Cubozoa (box jellies); and Hydrozoa, a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both <b>sessile</b> members, such as Hydra, and colonial swimmers, such as the Portuguese Man o' War. Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa were only firmly recognized as cnidarians in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Many sponges shed Sponge spicules, {{forming a}} dense carpet several meters deep that keeps away {{echinoderms}} which would otherwise prey on the sponges. They also produce toxins that prevent other <b>sessile</b> organisms such as bryozoans or sea squirts from growing {{on or near}} them, making sponges very effective competitors for living space. One of many examples includes ageliferin.|$|E
5|$|Most Hippeastrum bulbs are {{tunicate}} (a protective dry {{outer layer}} and fleshy concentric inner scales or leaf bases). The bulbs are generally between 512cm (2"5") {{in diameter and}} produce two to seven long-lasting evergreen or deciduous leaves that are 3090cm (12"36") long and 2.55cm (1"2") wide. The leaves are hysteranthous (develop after flowering), <b>sessile,</b> rarely persistent and subpetiolate.|$|E
5|$|The body becomes wider {{towards the}} head, {{which has a}} {{conspicuous}} mandibular groove. It also bears a pair of stalked compound eyes, {{as well as a}} <b>sessile</b> median eye, two pairs of antennae, and the mouthparts. The mouthparts comprise a labrum, directed backwards over the mouth and pairs of mandibles, paragnatha, maxillules and vestigial maxillae.|$|E
5|$|Bivalve {{molluscs}} {{are used}} as bioindicators to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem. They are particularly useful since they are <b>sessile</b> {{so that they are}} representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is used by some water treatment plants to test for estrogen-mimicking pollutants from industrial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Deciduous forests cover 80% of the park's {{area and}} belong to 28 forest and 18 bush habitats. This variety {{is due to}} the lower river valleys, the sea coast and the karstic terrain. These include forests of oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), <b>sessile</b> oak (Quercus petraea), Strandzhan oak (Quercus hartwissiana), Hungarian oak (Quercus frainetto), common {{hornbeam}} (Carpinus betulus), oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis) and small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) with undergrowth of pontic rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum), Caucasian whortleberry (Vaccinium arctostaphylos), cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus), Black Sea holly (Ilex colchica), Himalayan meadow primrose (Primula rosea) and common heather (Calluna).|$|E
5|$|Geastrum welwitschii {{also has}} similar {{morphological}} characters to G.minimum in having small fruit bodies, whitish spore sacs, and fibrillose peristomes. However G.welwitschii is differentiated from G.minimum by its fornicate, mostly 3–6, {{rays of the}} exoperidia, and the mycelial layer that easily loosens from the fibrous layer to form a mycelial cup. G.welwitschii is distinguished from G.entomophilum by its dark and <b>sessile</b> endoperidium, and smaller spores (2.8–3.5μm).|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus, who {{classified}} most {{kinds of}} <b>sessile</b> animals {{as belonging to}} the order Zoophyta in the class Vermes, mistakenly identified the genus Spongia as plants in the order Algae. For a long time thereafter sponges were assigned to a separate subkingdom, Parazoa ("beside the animals"), separate from the Eumetazoa which formed {{the rest of the}} kingdom Animalia. They have been regarded as a paraphyletic phylum, from which the higher animals have evolved. Other research indicates Porifera is monophyletic.|$|E
5|$|Most nemerteans are marine {{animals that}} burrow in sediments, lurk in crevices between shells, stones or the holdfasts of algae or <b>sessile</b> animals. Some live {{deep in the}} open oceans, and have {{gelatinous}} bodies. Others build semi-permanent burrows lined with mucus or produce cellophane-like tubes. Mainly in the tropics and subtropics, about 12 species appear in freshwater, and about a dozen species live on land in cool, damp places, for example under rotting logs.|$|E
5|$|Nielsen {{views the}} brachiopods and closely related phoronids as {{affiliated}} with the deuterostome pterobranchs because their lophophores are driven by one cilium per cell, while those of bryozoans, which he regards as protosomes, have multiple cilia per cell. However, pterobranchs are hemichordates and probably closely related to echinoderms, {{and there is no}} evidence that the latest common ancestor of pterobranchs and other hemichordates or the latest common ancestor of hemichordates and echinoderms was <b>sessile</b> and fed by means of tentacles.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{constitute}} the phylum Porifera, {{and have been}} defined as <b>sessile</b> metazoans (multicelled immobile animals) that have water intake and outlet openings connected by chambers lined with choanocytes, cells with whip-like flagella. However, a few carnivorous sponges have lost these water flow systems and the choanocytes. All known living sponges can remold their bodies, as most types of their cells can move within their bodies and a few can change from one type to another.|$|E
5|$|The {{inflorescence}} is scapose, {{the single}} stem or scape bearing either a solitary flower or forming an umbel {{with up to}} 20 blooms. Species bearing a solitary flower include section Bulbocodium and most of section Pseudonarcissus. Umbellate species have a fleshy racemose inflorescence (unbranched, with short floral stalks) with 2 to 15 or 20 flowers, such as N. papyraceus (see illustration, left) and N. tazetta (see Table I). The flower arrangement on the inflorescence may be either with (pedicellate) or without (<b>sessile)</b> floral stalks.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom Animalia or metazoa, {{contains}} multicellular {{organisms that}} are heterotrophic and motile (although some have secondarily adopted a <b>sessile</b> lifestyle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and {{these animals are}} also known as eumetazoans. They have an internal digestive chamber, {{with one or two}} openings; the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development. Metazoans do not include the sponges, which have undifferentiated cells.|$|E
5|$|The spores of C.stercoreus {{are roughly}} spherical and {{relatively}} large, with typical dimensions of 20–35x20–25µm, although great variability in spore size has been noted. The spores are <b>sessile</b> (growing {{directly from the}} surface of the basidium, without attachment via a sterigmata), and are separated from the basidia after it collapses and gelatinizes. This is accompanied by the gelatinization of the inner walls of the peridiole.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} common liverworts such as Conocephalum conicum and Marchantia polymorpha. Autumn Flapwort (Jamesoniella autumnali), a nationally scarce species most {{commonly found in}} the <b>sessile</b> oak woods of western Scotland, was discovered at a site on Ben Lomond in 2008. The species is named after the Scottish botanist, William Jameson. Northern prongwort is an endemic liverwort found only in the Beinn Eighe nature reserve. The high Cairngorms provide sites {{for a variety of}} other unusual liverworts including Marsupella arctica, the European distribution of which is confined to two sites here and Svalbard.|$|E
5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} <b>sessile</b> animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim. It {{has been found that}} encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded in their ability to swim by sponges than they are by barnacles.|$|E
5|$|Donald Canfield {{detected}} {{records of}} the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared– {{and the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation. Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses; the rise of small, <b>sessile</b> (stationary) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event, with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of oxygenation. However, the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism, with widespread anoxia having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|Most {{crustaceans}} are free-living aquatic animals, {{but some}} are terrestrial (e.g. woodlice), some are parasitic (e.g. Rhizocephala, fish lice, tongue worms) and some are <b>sessile</b> (e.g. barnacles). The group has an extensive fossil record, reaching back to the Cambrian, and includes living fossils such as Triops cancriformis, which has existed apparently unchanged since the Triassic period. More than 10 million tons of crustaceans are produced by fishery or farming for human consumption, the majority of it being shrimp and prawns. Krill and copepods are not as widely fished, but may be the animals with the greatest biomass on the planet, and form {{a vital part of}} the food chain. The scientific study of crustaceans is known as carcinology (alternatively, malacostracology, crustaceology or crustalogy), and a scientist who works in carcinology is a carcinologist.|$|E
5|$|Narcissus {{plants have}} one to several basal leaves which are linear, ligulate or strap shaped (long and narrow), {{sometimes}} channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) {{or may not}} (<b>sessile)</b> have a petiole stalk. The leaves are flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb. The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In the mature plant the leaves extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species the leaves are low hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colourless sheath. After flowering the leaves turn yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) is ripe.|$|E
5|$|The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are {{club-shaped}} {{with long}} stalks. They typically hold 4 spores that are <b>sessile,</b> that is, attached {{directly to the}} surface of the basidium, rather than by a short stalk (a sterigmata). Spores measure about 15 to 20µm long by 8 to 12µm wide. They are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, and notched at one end. During development, the spores are separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize along with other cells lining the inner walls of the peridiole. The spores expand in size somewhat after being detached from the basidia.|$|E
5|$|The hill is {{blanketed}} in heather, {{which gives}} it a deep purple colour during the summer. Ling and bell heather, gorse, <b>sessile</b> oak, ash, rowan, hazel, bracken, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns all grow on the hill or in surrounding woodland, {{as well as some}} unique whitebeam species. Exmoor ponies, red deer, pied flycatchers, wood warblers, lesser spotted woodpeckers, redstarts, dippers, snipe, skylarks and kestrels are some of the fauna to be found on or around the hill and in nearby Horner Woods, home to 14 of the 16 UK bat species and including barbastelle and Bechstein's bats.|$|E
5|$|The {{holes in}} the cuticle which allow for this {{digestive}} mechanism pose a challenge for the plant, since they serve as breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and <b>sessile</b> digestive glands is also costly. A {{recent study found that}} the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These results suggest that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} flowerhead reaches {{full size}} {{about two weeks}} after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another {{two weeks before the}} flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as florets, remain unopened—and the flowerhead retains a compact shape—before they mature and split open, revealing the stigma, style, and anther. The anther is <b>sessile,</b> lacking a filament, and lies next to the stigma {{at the end of the}} style. The outermost florets open first, with anthesis progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore.|$|E
5|$|Caprellamutica are {{omnivorous}} highly adaptable opportunistic feeders. Examinations {{of their}} stomach contents reveal a highly varied diet that {{depended on the}} particular substrate they are found on. They are predominantly detritivores, but have the remarkable ability of adjusting feeding methods from being grazers, scavengers, filter feeders, and even predators depending on the conditions of their environments. C.mutica sieve food particles or small organisms from the water by waving their bodies back and forth, with the comb-like setae on their second pair of antennae extended. They then clean off trapped particles by bending their antennae down to their mouthparts. They also use their antennae to scrape food particles from surfaces of their bodies or the substrate that they are clinging to. The large gnathopods are used for striking at and grasping both mobile and <b>sessile</b> prey. Known prey organisms of C.mutica include algae (both planktonic and macroalgae), dinoflagellates, hydrozoans, bryozoans, diatoms, copepods, brine shrimps, and other amphipods. They are capable of feeding on suspended organic particles, including fish feed and decaying organic matter. C.mutica are also known to engage in cannibalistic behavior on dead and dying individuals of their own species or genus.|$|E
5|$|Corals are <b>sessile</b> {{animals in}} the class Anthozoa and differ from most other cnidarians in not having a medusa stage in their life cycle. The body unit of the animal is a polyp. Most corals are colonial, the initial polyp budding to produce another and the colony {{gradually}} developing from this small start. In stony corals, also known as hard corals, the polyps produce a skeleton composed of calcium carbonate to strengthen and protect the organism. This is deposited by the polyps and by the coenosarc, the living tissue that connects them. The polyps sit in cup-shaped depressions in the skeleton known as corallites. Colonies of stony coral are very variable in appearance; a single species may adopt an encrusting, plate-like, bushy, columnar or massive solid structure, the various forms often being linked to different types of habitat, with variations in light level and water movement being significant.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus olla has -shaped spores with {{dimensions}} of 10–146–8µm. In 1927, George Willard Martin examined the microscopic features of {{various members of}} the Nidulariaceae family, including Cyathus olla. He noted that in this species, the basidia—spore-bearing cells—are club-shaped or cylindrical and have long stems, and they sometimes have a clamp connection at the basal end of the structure. Basidia typically hold between two and four <b>sessile</b> spores that are directly attached to the basidium, rather than via a sterigma. Revealed only after the spore is separated, a temporary apiculus marks the point of attachment. The spores are generally separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize; this basidial breakdown typically occurs simultaneously with a gelatinization of cells lining the inside wall of the peridiole. After separating from the basidia the outer wall of the spores may thicken, although they generally do not increase in size.|$|E
5|$|In {{almost all}} layers {{arthropods}} {{are the most}} abundant and diverse group of fossils in the GPB, followed by sponges. 69.2% of GPB individuals and 63.9% of species lived {{on the surface of}} the sea bed; within this group, mobile deposit feeders that extracted food particles from the sediment accounted for 38.2% of the total number of individuals and 16.8% of the total species; the smallest sub-group was mobile hunters and scavengers; and the rest were <b>sessile</b> suspension feeders. Animals that lived in the sediment made up 12.7% of the species and 7.4% of the individuals; the largest sub-group was mobile hunters and scavengers. Bottom-dwelling animals capable of swimming comprised 12.7% of species and 7.4% of individuals. Organisms that spent their whole life swimming were very rare, accounting for only 1.5% of individuals and 8.3% of species.|$|E
5|$|In most species, {{the sexes}} are {{separate}} {{and there is}} little sexual dimorphism, but a few species are hermaphroditic and some parasitic forms show large differences between the sexes. Some Cymothoidans are protandrous hermaphrodites, starting life as males and later changing sex, and some Anthuroideans are the reverse, being protogynous hermaphrodites that are born female. Some Gnathiidans males are <b>sessile</b> and live with a group of females. Males have a pair of penises, which may be fused in some species. The sperm is transferred to the female by the modified second pleopod which receives it from the penis and which is then inserted into a female gonopore. The sperm is stored in a special receptacle, a swelling on the oviduct close to the gonopore. Fertilisation only takes place when the eggs are shed soon after a moult, at which time a connection is established between the semen receptacle and the oviduct.|$|E
5|$|Sundews are characterised by the glandular tentacles, {{topped with}} sticky secretions, that cover their laminae. The {{trapping}} and digestion mechanism usually employs {{two types of}} glands: stalked glands that secrete sweet mucilage to attract and ensnare insects and enzymes to digest them, and <b>sessile</b> glands that absorb the resulting nutrient soup (the latter glands are missing in some species, such as D.erythrorhiza). Small prey, mainly consisting of insects, are attracted by the sweet secretions of the peduncular glands. Upon touching these, the prey become entrapped by sticky mucilage which prevents their progress or escape. Eventually, the prey either succumb to death through exhaustion or through asphyxiation as the mucilage envelops them and clogs their spiracles. Death usually occurs within 15 minutes. The plant meanwhile secretes esterase, peroxidase, phosphatase and protease enzymes. These enzymes dissolve the insect and free the nutrients contained within it. This nutrient mixture is then absorbed through the leaf surfaces {{to be used by}} the rest of the plant.|$|E
