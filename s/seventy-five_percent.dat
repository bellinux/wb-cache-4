40|$|This paper {{traces the}} historiography of Angel Island Immigration Station (AIIS) {{focusing}} on three cinematic documentaries which seek {{to explain the}} history of AIIS: Carved in Silence produced in 1988 by Felicia Lowe, Discovering Angel Island: The Story behind the Poems produced in 2004 by National Asian Americans Telecommunication Association (NAATA) in partnership with KQED and Angel Island Immigration Station Tour produced in 2010 by Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation (AIISF) as an official guide to the National Historic Landmark. Produced in different decades, the three documentaries interestingly provide expanding history of the Center. This paper also intends to compare these documentaries to the most comprehensive and recent history by Erika Lee and Judy Yung in "Angel Island: Immigrant Gateway to America" published in 2010 {{to understand how the}} construction {{of the history of the}} Center keeps expanding. This study employs Jack C. Ellis and Betsy A. McLane’s theory on documentary to read the subjects, purposes, forms, production methods and particular experience provided by the three documentaries which seek to explain and convince the U. S. public the importance of the history of Angel Island. According to Ellis and McLane, documentary can be read in terms of subjects: purposes, viewpoints, or approaches; forms; production methods and techniques; and sort of experience they offer audience. The lack of information and research dealing with the presence of non-Chinese immigrants in AIIS is a major problem. The long journey of the recognition of the more comprehensive history of AIIS is still shadowed by its trigger, the discovery of the Chinese calligraphy. People and organizations concerned with the reconstruction of the history are still dominated by those related to Chinese community. The historical factor of Chinese exclusion era, from 1882 to 1943, and the fact that <b>seventy-five</b> <b>percents</b> of immigrants arriving at Angel Island were Chinese are the main reasons why the presence of Chinese immigrant has become the main theme on the discussion of the history of AIIS...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} the relationship between supply chain strategies and performance of large-scale manufacturing firms in Kenya by addressing three primary gaps in the literature. The research gaps include the research findings and results on the relationship between supply chain strategies and firm performance that have been contradicting and no attempt to clear the contradictions; biased and unbalanced analysis of the different measures of firm performance, and failure to use weighted scores to measure firm performance. Resource-Based View guided this study. A sample of one hundred and thirty-eight (138) firms was drawn using proportionate sampling from a population of six hundred and twenty-seven (627) large-scale manufacturing firms in Kenya. The response rate was <b>seventy-five</b> (75) <b>percent.</b> The correlation analysis and regression analysis models were used to test the hypotheses. The study findings indicate that Supply chain strategies are useful predictors of the firm’s performance as supply chain strategies explain 76. 7 % of the changes in the firm’s performance.

Of these latter cases, 56 (75 percent) recalled a tick bite three to 27 days prior to the development of erythema chronicum migrans. Patients experienced possible exposure to Ixodes dammini in at least 24 (28 percent) of the 87 Minnesota counties; however, over 50 percent had reported exposure in one of eight east-central counties near or immediately west of the Wisconsin border. Serologic studies for antibody against the Ixodes dammini spirochete were completed on 30 patients with onset in 1982 and 1983. Of 28 patients with paired acute and convalescent serum samples, only two (7 percent) had fourfold rises in antibody titers. Lyme disease is an emerging public health problem in Minnesota. Additional studies are needed to define the risk of disease by geographic area within the state. Physicians statewide should be alert to the possibility of Lyme disease among their patients, since only 39 percent of patients with onset in 1982 and 1983 were exposed in their county of residence...|$|R

5000|$|Like other spiders, {{the male}} {{of this species}} uses his pedipalps to insert sperm into the female's seminal receptacles. The {{terminal}} joint of the palps become detached and remains in the female during <b>seventy-five</b> to eighty <b>percent</b> of matings, especially when the female is aggressive. [...] It is surmised that the severed copulatory organs may function as plugs to prevent leakage of sperm and that abandoning them may be a sensible option for the male as otherwise his damaged palps might leak haemolymph. Although their loss effectively makes the male sterile, he usually stays with the female and fends off rival males, and this behaviour protects his reproductive investment. A subsequent study suggests that losing the extra weight of the pedipalps allows males to more effectively fend off rival males, guard their mate and thereby ensure paternity.|$|R

5|$|Also at {{the dawn}} of the new century, however, rising demand for coffee and rubber gave the Brazilian {{government}} an influx of revenue.

A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal. The National Congress of Brazil drew up and passed a large naval acquisition program in late 1904, but it was two years before any ships were ordered. While they first ordered three small battleships, the launch of the revolutionary British Dreadnought—which heralded a new and powerful type of warship—caused the Brazilians to cancel their order in favor of two dreadnoughts, with a third to follow.|$|R

The multivariate regression analysis obtained a significant variance in exercise adherence associated with perceived pain measures accounted for by BDNF genotype. The multivariate regression analyses for positive affect were not statistically significant. The implications of the study suggest a heritable difference in the influence of subjective experience on long-term health behavior outcomes and stress the importance of individually tailored exercise interventions...|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{hepatitis}} C is {{a potentially}} life-threatening liver disease that receives little public attention and frequently goes undiagnosed. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is spread by blood-to-blood contact, primarily through sharing of contaminated syringes and other drug-injecting equipment. Prior to 1992, when widespread blood screening technology was first introduced, HCV was also spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants. 1 The virus is transmitted less frequently through unprotected sex, mother-to-child transmission and needlestick injuries {{in health care}} settings. Chronic hepatitis C is called a “silent killer ” because it can slowly damage the liver over many years, causing cirrhosis (liver scarring), liver cancer and other serious liver diseases without noticeable symptoms. <b>Seventy-five</b> to 85 <b>percent</b> of acute HCV infections become chronic, and 75 {{percent of people who}} have chronic HCV do not know they are infected. 2 As many as four million Americans are now living with chronic HCV. 3 There is no vaccine to prevent HCV infection.

Intensive consolidation can deliver a similar survival, of which high-dose Ara-C has been widely adopted, but other intensive schedules appear equivalent. It is not known how many treatment courses are required. Patients are at differing risks of relapse which may influence the choice of treatment. In trials where a risk profile is available, and where a donor versus no-donor analysis is performed, there appears to be little robust evidence to support transplant in good or poor risk disease, although the experience in the latter groups is not unanimous. Standard risk patients may be the subgroup who deliver survival benefit, but since chemotherapy continues to improve, there remains some uncertainty. It is possible that technical improvements in transplantation, such as peripheral blood as a source of stem cells, may remove this uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine {{correlates}} of polypharmacy among underserved community-dwelling older African American adults. Methods. This study recruited 400 underserved older African Americans adults living in South Los Angeles. The structured face-to-face interviews collected data on participants’ characteristics and elicited data pertaining to the type, frequency, dosage, and indications of all medications used by participants. Results. <b>Seventy-five</b> and thirty <b>percent</b> of participants take at least five and ten medications per day, respectively. Thirty-eight percent of participants received prescription medications from at least three providers. Inappropriate drug use occurred among seventy percent of the participants. Multivariate analysis showed that number of providers was the strongest correlate of polypharmacy. Moreover, data show that gender, comorbidity, and potentially inappropriate medication use are other major correlates of polypharmacy. Conclusions. This study shows a high rate of polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medication use among underserved older African American adults. We documented strong associations between polypharmacy and use of potentially inappropriate medications, comorbidities, and having multiple providers. Polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications may be attributed to poor coordination and management of medications among providers and pharmacists. There is an urgent need to develop innovative and effective strategies to reduce inappropriate polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medication in underserved elderly minority populations...|$|R
