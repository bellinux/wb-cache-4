25|$|Extensive {{sand dunes}} stretch for several miles between Birkdale and Woodvale {{to the south}} of the town. The Ainsdale sand dunes have been {{designated}} as a national nature reserve and a Ramsar site. Local fauna include the Natterjack toad and the <b>Sand</b> <b>lizard.</b> The town contains examples of Victorian architecture and town planning, on Lord Street and elsewhere. A particular feature of the town is the extensive tree planting. This was one of the conditions required by the Hesketh family when they made land available for development in the 19th century. Hesketh Park at the northern end of the town is named after them, having been built on land donated by Rev. Charles Hesketh.|$|E
25|$|The area of {{the site}} is , and {{comprises}} {{a significant amount of}} heath—primarily the dry heath Calluna vulgaris and Erica cinerea, but locally dominant are the damp or humid heath Erica tetralix and Molinia caerulea. Rare heathland species include the <b>sand</b> <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta agilis), smooth snake (Coronella austriaca), heath grasshopper (Chorthippus vagansand) and the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata). Other local heathland species at Ferndown Common include the silver-studded blue butterfly (Plebejus argus), European nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus) and European stonechat. In the south-east of the site there are several small ponds, which support at least 14 species of dragonflies, most of which are heathland species. Also resident in the ponds are large populations of the widespread, although in decline, common frog (Rana temporaria) and palmate newt (Triturus helveticus).|$|E
25|$|The area of {{the site}} is , and {{comprises}} {{a significant amount of}} heath; the northern and western parts are primarily of the dry heath Calluna vulgaris and Erica cinerea, while the low-lying parts of the south-east are mostly the damp or humid heath Erica tetralix and Molinia caerulea. Rare heathland species include the <b>sand</b> <b>lizard</b> (Lacerta agilis), smooth snake (Coronella austriaca), heath grasshopper (Chorthippus vagansand) and the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata). Parley Common has an abundance of spider fauna—at least 147 species—which includes the very rare Ero aphana, Xysticus robustus—otherwise found in only a few places in the New Forest—and Gnaphosa lugubris. The site holds claim to a number of firsts: the smooth snake was first recorded in Britain in Parley Common in 1853; the Mazarine blue (Cyaniris semiargus)—now extinct in Britain—was first discovered here in the late nineteenth century; the moth Pachythelia villosella and the ringed carpet moth (Cleora cinctaria) were also first discovered here.|$|E

25|$|On Hesselberg {{all forms}} (high forest, coppice-with-standards, coppice) and types (temperate {{coniferous}} forest, mixed forest, deciduous forest) of forests can be found. The coppice {{in the upper}} regions of the northern slope has the strangest appearance. After coppicing more light reaches the ground and thermophile animals such as the <b>sand</b> <b>lizard</b> thrive. Later, when the canopy closes again, many other specialised animals such as the Eurasian woodcock find a suitable habitat. All game that is typical of German forests (for example hare, roe, red fox, and squirrel) are present in Hesselberg's woods. The drumming of woodpeckers and the crying of cuckoos contribute to {{the mood of the}} wood as well as the singing of countless birds. Various Ranunculaceae—such as liverworts and wood anemones—are the signs of spring in Hesselberg's forests. In May ramsons turn the ground of the deciduous forest into a carpet of green and white blooms. After blooming the intense odour of garlic fills the air. The various species of orchids such as the red helleborine have become increasingly rare. The Turk's-cap lily, which belongs to the lily family, can still be found relatively often but flower's diversity is in need of protection. The erica and the Cytisus scoparius prefer the iron sandstone layers of the lower parts of the slopes.|$|E

500|$|In {{this chapter}} Beddard {{discusses}} the warning coloration (aposematism) of animals, which he notes [...] "have a precisely opposite tendency" [...] to camouflage, [...] "viz., to render their possessor conspicuous". He at once {{says that the}} explanation was [...] "first devised by Mr. Wallace" [...] for insects. The chapter therefore begins with the insects, often using English species as examples. He examines critically whether eye-like markings and other warnings actually work. He discusses experiments by Poulton on the elephant hawk-moth, where a <b>Sand</b> <b>lizard</b> is only briefly startled, and his own at the London zoo using a range of predators and different insects. Beddard is only partially convinced, flirting with Dr. Eisig's theory that the pigments creating the colours of caterpillars are inherently distasteful, and hence that [...] "the brilliant colours (i.e. the abundant secretion of pigment) have caused the inedibility of the species, rather than that the inedibility has necessitated the production of bright colours as an advertisement." [...] So Beddard suggests that [...] "the advent of bird-life proved a disastrous event for these animals, and compelled them to undergo various modifications", except when they were already by luck warning coloured and distasteful.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Sand</b> <b>Lizard,</b> Lacerta agilis, {{provides}} us {{an example of}} cryptic female choice during the insemination phase of mating. [...] Females routinely and indiscriminately copulate with several males. The females who mate more often have greater hatching success, lowering the incidence of deformities among offspring, and enhancing survival of free-living offspring. The aforementioned consequences {{are a result of}} the females' ability to differentially use the sperm from the least related male. [...] Thus, the males most genetically similar to the female sire less offspring.|$|E
60|$|But I {{have only}} time {{to point out}} to you a few curious facts with regard to reptiles, which should be {{specially}} interesting to a Hampshire bio- geologist. You know, of course, that in Ireland there are no reptiles, save the little common lizard, Lacerta agilis, and a few frogs on the mountain-tops--how they got there I cannot conceive. And you will, of course, guess, and rightly, that the reason of the absence of reptiles is: that Ireland was parted off from England before the creatures, which certainly spread from southern and warmer climates, had time to get there. You know, of course, that we have a few reptiles in England. But you may not be aware that, as soon as you cross the Channel, you find many more species of reptiles than here, as well as those which you find here. The magnificent green lizard which rattles about like a rabbit in a French forest, is never found here; simply because it had not worked northward till after the Channel was formed. But there are three reptiles peculiar to this part of England which should be most interesting to a Hampshire zoologist. The one is the <b>sand</b> <b>lizard</b> (L. stirpium), found on Bourne-heath, and, I suspect, in the South Hampshire moors likewise--a North European and French species. Another, the Coronella laevis, a harmless French and Austrian snake, which has been found about me, in North Hants and South Berks, now about fifteen or twenty times. I have had three specimens from my own parish. I believe it not to be uncommon; and most probably to be found, by those who will look, both in the New Forest and Woolmer. The third is the Natterjack, or running toad (Bufo Rubeta), a most beautifully spotted animal, with a yellow stripe down his back, which is common with me at Eversley, and common also in many moorlands of Hants and Surrey; and, according to Fleming, on heaths near London, and as far north-east as Lincolnshire; in which case it will belong to the Germanic fauna. Now, here again we have cases of animals which have just been able to get hither before the severance of England and France; and which, not being reinforced from the rear, have been forced to stop, in small and probably decreasing colonies, on the spots nearest the coast which were fit for them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. •Nucleotide {{sequences}} of the mitochondrial protein coding cytochrome b (cyt b; 650 bp) and small-subunit 12 S ribosomal RNA (~ 350 bp) genes {{were used in}} analyses of phylogenetic relation-ships among extant phrynosomatid <b>sand</b> <b>lizards,</b> including an examination of competing hypotheses regarding the evolution of "earlessness. " Sequences were obtained from all currently recognized species of <b>sand</b> <b>lizards</b> as well as representatives {{of the first and}} second outgroups and analyzed using both parsimony and likelihood methods. The cyt b data offer strong support for relationships that correspond with relatively recent divergences and moderate to low support for relationships reflecting more ancient divergences within the clade. These data support monophyly of the "earless" taxa, the placement of Uma as the sister taxon to the other <b>sand</b> <b>lizards,</b> and monophyly of all four taxa traditionally ranked as genera. All well-supported relationships in the 12 S phylogeny are com-pletely congruent with weU-supported relationships in the cyt b phylogeny; however, the 12 S data alone provide very Kttle support for deeper divergences. Phylogenetic relationships within species are concordant with geography and suggest patterns of phylogeographic differentiation, including the conclusion that at least one currently recognized species (Holbrookia macúlala) actually consists of more than one species.

40|$|Abstract Background Lizards are {{considered}} zooprophylactic {{for almost all}} Borrelia burgdorferi species, and act as dilution hosts in parts of North America. Whether European lizards significantly reduce the ability of B. burgdorferi to maintain itself in enzootic cycles, and consequently decrease the infection rate of Ixodes ricinus ticks for B. burgdorferi and other tick-borne pathogens in Western Europe is not clear. Results Ticks were collected from <b>sand</b> <b>lizards,</b> their habitat (heath) and from the adjacent forest. DNA of tick-borne pathogens was detected by PCR followed by reverse line blotting. Tick densities were measured at all four locations by blanket dragging. Nymphs and adult ticks collected from lizards had a significantly lower (1. 4 %) prevalence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato, compared to questing ticks in heath (24 %) or forest (19 %). The prevalence of Rickettsia helvetica was significantly higher in ticks from lizards (19 %) than those from woodland (10 %) whereas neither was {{significantly different from the}} prevalence in ticks from heather (15 %). The prevalence of Anaplasma and Ehrlichia spp in heather (12 %) and forest (14 %) were comparable, but significantly lower in ticks from <b>sand</b> <b>lizards</b> (5. 4 %). The prevalence of Babesia spp in ticks varied between 0 and 5. 3 %. Tick load of lizards ranged from 1 - 16. Tick densities were ~ 5 -fold lower in the heather areas than in woodlands at all four sites. Conclusions Despite their apparent low reservoir competence, the presence of <b>sand</b> <b>lizards</b> had insignificant impact on the B. burgdorferi s. l. infection rate of questing ticks. In contrast, <b>sand</b> <b>lizards</b> might act as reservoir hosts for R. helvetica. Remarkably, the public health risk from tick-borne diseases is approximately five times lower in heather than in woodland, due to the low tick densities in heather. </p...|$|R
