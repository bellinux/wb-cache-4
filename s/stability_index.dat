40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the applicability of the electrical conductivity method to assess the stability of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) at early age. The method consists in inserting four electrode pairs at different depths of concrete to monitor local change in ionic concentrations with time. Such variations can reflect migration of bleed water along concrete column during the plastic stage. The experimental set-up consisted of a rectangular column measuring 1005 mm in height and 250 × 250 mm in cross section. The variations in ionic concentrations were exploited to derive <b>stability</b> <b>indices</b> with regards to bleeding and homogeneity of concrete. Derived <b>stability</b> <b>indices</b> included bleeding coefficient, segregation coefficient, and homogeneity index. Various SCC mixtures made with a fixed water-to-cementitious materials ratio (w/cm) of 0. 42, different aggregate gradations, and slump-flow values of 650 ± 10 and 700 ± 10 mm were evaluated. Analysis of changes in ionic concentrations along column samples with time provided adequate evaluation of stability of SCC. For example, the increase in the concentration of viscosity-modifying admixture from 1 % to 2 % was shown to decrease the homogeneity index from 0. 36 to 0. 27, reflecting better stability. Validation procedure was carried out by correlating <b>stability</b> <b>indices</b> derived from electrical conductivity measurements to physical variations of coarse aggregate concentrations determined on plastic concrete sampled from the tested column elements at the end of electrical conductivity monitoring period. Good correlations between <b>stability</b> <b>indices</b> and aggregate concentrations are established...|$|R

The degree of stability / instability can be determined by using vertical wind profile (hodograph) and <b>stability</b> <b>indices.</b> Analysis of these two elements {{was used to determine}} the degree of atmospheric instability for heavy rains in north-western Romania, for the warm season of the 2010 - 2012 period. The hodographs were made using the atmospheric soundings in Cluj-Napoca, which permitted to determine the air advection intensity between different layers of the atmosphere (sea level- 925 hPa, 925 - 850 hPa, 850 - 700 and 700 - 500 hPa). The atmospheric <b>stability</b> <b>indices</b> were used to calculate the intensity of instability.

40|$|Abstract. Stability is an {{important}} property of machine learning algorithms. Stability in clustering {{may be related to}} clustering quality or ensemble diversity, and therefore used in several ways to achieve a deeper understanding or better confidence in bioinformatic data analysis. In the specific field of fuzzy biclustering, stability can be analyzed by porting the definition of existing <b>stability</b> <b>indexes</b> to a fuzzy setting, and then adapting them to the biclustering problem. This paper presents work done in this direction, by selecting some representative <b>stability</b> <b>indexes</b> and experimentally verifying and comparing their properties. Experimental results are presented that indicate both a general agreement and some differences among the selected methods. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of voltage stability assessment experiences sizeable anxiety {{in the safe}} operation of power systems, due to the complications of a strain power system. With the snowballing of power demand by the consumers and also the restricted amount of power sources, therefore, the system has to perform at its maximum proficiency. The noteworthy to discover the maximum ability boundary prior to voltage collapse should be undertaken. A preliminary warning can be perceived to evade the interruption of power system’s capacity. This research considered the implementation of static and time-step system monitoring methods that able to provide a timely warning in the power system. Numerous types of line voltage <b>stability</b> <b>indices</b> (LVSI) are differentiated in this research to resolve their effectuality to determine the weakest lines for the power systems. The main motivation of these indices is used to predict and forecast the proximity towards voltage instability in the power system control and security applications. The indices are also able to decide the weakest load buses which are close to voltage collapse in the power system. Therefore, the static and time-step simulation (TSS) results are {{used to calculate the}} line <b>stability</b> <b>indices</b> and to ratify with voltage <b>stability</b> <b>indices</b> theory. The line voltage <b>stability</b> <b>indices</b> are assessed using the IEEE 9 -Bus system, IEEE 14 -Bus System and IEEE 30 -Bus system to validate their practicability. The results are used to calculate the line <b>stability</b> <b>indices</b> by using Matlab software. This research also introduced the implementation of voltage stability monitoring by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Results demonstrated that the calculated indices and the estimated indices by using ANN are practically relevant in predicting the manifestation of voltage collapse in the system. Overall, VCPI(Power) index is able to detect the voltage collapse point precisely due to its accuracy in forecasting. This index successfully showed the capability to forecast the voltage collapse point either in small or a larger power system network. Therefore, essential actions can be taken by the operators in order to dodge voltage collapse incident from arising...|$|R

40|$|Validation of Several Atmospheric <b>Stability</b> <b>Indices</b> for the Storms Generating Torrential Rain Showers in the North-West of Romania. The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{atmospheric}} instability types that lead to torrential rain formation in the North-Western part of Romania and with the role that certain <b>stability</b> <b>indices</b> play in establishing the atmospheric instability potential. 35 years of warm season rainfall data from 14 meteorological stations in the North-West of Romania have been analysed in this respect. The Hellman criterion was employed {{in order to establish}} the torrential character of the rainfall events, having made use of 271 of such rainfall events in the analysed period (1975 - 2009). Considering that the synoptic context of the torrential rain occurrence differs according to the instability type existing at the moment of their apparition, the analysis of the <b>stability</b> <b>indices</b> has taken this feature into consideration as well. Hence, three types of instability have been identified (convective lifting, frontal lifting and that produced due to the “cut off” nuclei) their analysis underlining the highest frequency of torrential rains caused by the convective lifting (49. 1 %), followed by the frontal type (27. 7 %) and the ‘cut off” type (23. 2 %), their highest percentage being registered in the summer. The values of 5 <b>stability</b> <b>indices</b> have been taken into account (KI, VT, CT, TTI and LI), determined {{on the basis of the}} aerologic survey at 00 GMT time, undertaken in Cluj-Napoca, plus two more modified indices (KMOD and TTMOD).
