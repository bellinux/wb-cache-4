30|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, there has been {{considerable}} attention {{to the evolution of}} Al-based MMCs developed by powder metallurgy (P/M) route of manufacturing. The main advantage of this kind of manufacturing process is the good distribution of reinforcing particles, low processing temperature and the ability to produce near net shape products with intricate designs (Min et al. 2005; Torralba et al. 2003). A number of studies have been conducted to study the effects of reinforcement of very hard metals as well as ceramics in different grades of aluminium series of powder matrix (El-Kady and Fathy 2014; Jabbari Taleghani et al. 2014; Abdollahi et al. 2014). Layers of oxide formation take place in the P/M specimen during <b>sintering,</b> as <b>aluminium</b> is highly prone to oxide formation. During thermo-mechanical treatments, the covered oxide layer breaks due to highly induced shear stress, leading to a strongly bonded microstructure and improved mechanical properties which eliminate the main drawback of AMCs (Schatt et al. 1997). The use of traditional shear-faced die in extrusion causes product defects owing to the existence of higher velocity relative difference at die exit (Zhang et al. 2012 a; 2012 b). The use of mathematically contoured die (preferably zero, die entry and exit angle) for the MMC extrusion is highly recommendable.|$|R

The major drawback in the commercially available press <b>sintered</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloy is porosity which is mainly dependent on the powder metallurgical process parameters such as compaction pressure, sintering temperature and cooling rate after sintering.

40|$|In recent years, {{rapid growth}} has {{been seen in the}} use of {{aluminium}} powder metallurgy (PM), largely driven by the automotive industry. However, there are limitations on the use of aluminium PM components, which are due, in part, to their mechanical properties. The fatigue properties are particularly limiting, as they are insufficient for use in many loadbearing applications. Although the mechanisms and fracture mechanics of fatigue in aluminium alloys have been well documented for wrought and cast material, it was not clear whether this research could be directly applied to sintered materials because of their unique microstructural features. Therefore, the primary objective of this research was to investigate and characterise the fatigue behaviour of a sintered 2 xxx series aluminium alloy. Specimens were prepared from a pre-mixed, elemental powder, AMB- 2712 (Al- 3. 8 Cu- 1 Mg- 0. 7 Si- 0. 1 Sn + 1. 5 % Acrawax). The powder was compacted uniaxially in a floating die, with a compaction pressure of 200 MPa. Green parts were then sintered in a dry, high purity nitrogen atmosphere. The standard sintering parameters were 30 minutes at 600 °C. Fatigue testing was carried out in 3 -point bending, under constant cyclic loading conditions and with a stress ratio, R, of 0. 1. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the tensile surface and the fracture surface of fatigued specimens. <b>Sintered</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloy AMB- 2712 (compacted at 200 MPa and sintered for 30 mins at 600 °C) has a 0. 2 % yield strength of 138 MPa and 2 % ductility. The density is 2. 67 g/cm 3, corresponding to a porosity of 4. 4 %, and the average grain size is 93 ± 7 μm. The fatigue endurance strength is ~ 145 MPa (R= 0. 1). Fatigue crack initiation occurs at a pore or pore cluster, located either at or slightly below the tensile surface. SEM analysis showed that the fatigue fracture surface can be divided into three regions, in terms of the dominant crack propagation mechanism in each. Region 1 contains the fatigue initiation site and initial, transgranular crack propagation, whilst propagation in Region 2 is primarily intergranular. The transition from transgranular to intergranular propagation occurs when the size of the plastic zone preceding the crack tip is approximately three times the grain size. At this point, Al 2 Cu particles in the grain boundaries ahead of the crack tip are fractured, creating an easier path for propagation. Region 3 is the fast fracture region, where crack propagation is by ductile overload. A number of distinctive features were observed on the fatigue fracture surfaces, including striations, microvoid coalescence dimples and a wide variety of step-like features. The morphology of the features observed within a transgranularly grain are thought to be determined by the level of mismatch between the plane of crack propagation and the crystallographic orientation of the grain in which they form. Porosity has significant deleterious effects on the fatigue properties of sintered AMB- 2712, primarily due to its role in fatigue initiation. Relationships between the fatigue-initiating pore size and the fatigue life are well described by classical fracture mechanics. The empirical Paris Law constants m and C are 4. 48 and 10 - 10. 7 respectively. These values are in good agreement with those reported for aluminium castings, suggesting that fatigue behaviour of sintered AMB- 2712 is analogous to that of cast Al alloys. Fatigue life was observed to decrease exponentially with decreasing density – i. e. as porosity increases. The experimentally derived relationship between density and fatigue life may have potential use in predicting the approximate fatigue lives of sintered AMB- 2712 components prior to installation. Oxide films, located in the grain boundaries of intergranularly cracked regions, were observed on the fatigue fracture surfaces of <b>sintered</b> <b>aluminium</b> specimens. It is suggested that the films are artefacts of fatigue testing, which occur due to local fretting of mating fracture surfaces during cyclic loading...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to improve the {{properties}} of pressed and <b>sintered</b> <b>aluminium</b> powder alloys. This improvement was to be achieved using two methods. The first method involved the selection of an alloy system using binary aluminium phase diagrams and {{a knowledge of the}} phase diagram characteristics of ideal sintering systems. The second approach involved the judicious use of selected trace element additions to modify the sintering characteristics of aluminium and its alloys. A trace amount of magnesium was found to be critical to the sintering of aluminium powder due to its disrupting effect on the tenacious oxide layer covering the powder particles. The critical amount of Mg required to optimise both density and mechanical properties is dependent on the specific volume of oxide and the therefore particle size. The optimum concentration is 0. 1 - 1. 0 wt% Mg. The Al-Sn phase diagram exhibits many of the characteristics of an ideal sintering system. Unsurprisingly, Sn was found to be an extremely efficient sintering aid, but only in the presence of Mg. Near full density parts were produced using an Al- 8 Sn- 0. 15 Mg alloy in short sintering times (30 minutes). Additionally, as-sintered ductilities exceeding 20 % were achieved using an Al- 2 Sn- 0. 15 Mg alloy. Alloys based on the Al-Sn-Mg system lend themselves to sintering without compaction and therefore freeformed Al-Sn-Mg alloys have been produced and sintered to near full density from a starting density of ~ 50 %. Trace amounts of Sn (Pb, In, Bi, or Sb) enhance the sintering response of an Al- 4 Cu- 0. 15 Mg alloy via a vacancy binding mechanism. A similar mechanism suppresses natural ageing and stimulates artificial ageing when trace amounts of Sn are added to this alloy. A Sn-modified 2 XXX series alloy has also been produced with mechanical properties nearly 20 % above current commercial alloys.

Heat is released when the gaseous adsorptive (e. g. water vapor) attaches to a microporous adsorbent (e. g. zeolite). The process is reversible, i. e. by supply of heat the adsorptive can be separated from the adsorbent. In a closed system, a thermodynamic cycle can be realised. During adsorption, heat is drawn from an evaporator that supplies the adsorptive. The adsorptive released during desorption is condensed in a condenser, releasing the heat of condensation. Water as adsorptive shows a few big advantages: It is not hazardous nor climate-damaging in its application, it is available ubiquitously and it has the largest enthalpy of evaporation of all known refrigerants. There are several adsorbents that show a large water uptake. One disadvantage is the low vapor pressure and the related low density. Gradients in density or pressure necessary for mass transfer thus limit the adsorption process much earlier than with other adsorptives. Goal of ongoing R&D work are compact adsorption devices with high transformation efficiency also in the low power region. Previous devices usually used an adsorbent pellet bed in a heat exchanger. Due to the typical point contacts between adsorbent grains and the heat exchanger in an adsorbent bed, usually heat transfer is limiting the dynamic adsorption process. A very promising opportunity to overcome this limitation is given by adsorbent coated porous metallic structures, which can enhance heat and mass transfer significantly. For the optimization of such adsorbers, a precise and experimentally validated description of the adsorption kinetics is necessary. Water vapor transport in the macropores of the hierarchical pore structure of such composites takes place in the transitional regime between viscous flow and Knudsen diffusion, in which the mean free path in pure water vapor atmosphere reaches the same order of magnitude as the characteristical geometric dimensions of the structure. In the micropores of the adsorbent crystallites, diffusion and adsorption are unseparably connected. Transport takes place by molecular diffusion and diffusion in the adsorbed phase. Starting from theory of adsorption thermodynamics as well as models of mass transfer, in this thesis a model of non-isothermal adsorption kinetics is developed that includes the influence of mass transfer on two scales (bidisperse model) on the transient adsorption process. Transport parameters needed in this model are derived experimentally by various methods. In particular, two experimental methods used in this thesis are described more in detail: On the one hand, a permeability measurement is presented, in which the porous structures are flowed through with gas in the transition area between viscous flow and Knudsen diffusion (low vacuum). By this method, macropore transport parameters (mean pore diameter, tortuosity) are identified. By comparison to results from porosimetry and microscopy, the results are checked for plausibility. On the other hand, the transient adsorption process of selected samples is measured with a volumetric pressure jump method. By fitting the physical bidispers model of coupled heat and mass transfer to the measurement data, the parameters not accessible by other measurements are identified. By simulation of adsorption cycles, the influence of the various transport processes on the overall adsorption process is quantified. With help of the developed model and the identified transport parameters, a novel adsorber geometry based on the aluminium fibre zeolite composites is studied. It is shown, that apart from heat transfer to the heat exchanger fluid, water diffusion in the micropores of the adsorbent is dominating the transient process, while macropore transport has only little influence for the considered composite thicknesses. A Pareto optimization for the two optimization criteria efficiency (COP) and volumetric power density finally show the huge potential of the novel adsorbent composites and give practical cues for optimal geometries and operating conditions of such a promising fibre composite adsorber...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{investigation}} {{relating to the}} production method and mechanical properties of two types of aluminium/silicon carbide composites. These materials are manufactured using specialised powder metallurgy (P/M) techniques, which includes mixing/milling, powder compaction, sintering and hot extrusion. The first type of composite utilises pure aluminium as the matrix, whilst the other type uses matrix consist of aluminium and in-situ oxide particles, namely <b>sintered</b> <b>aluminium</b> powder (SAP). The second type of composite combines silicon carbon particles with very small in-situ oxide particulates inside the aluminium matrix, creating a dual reinforcement system. These composites are not often characterised in literature as the fabrication process is very challenging, particularly using P/M methods. Therefore, this work offers rare insight into aluminium composites {{with a combination of}} different size reinforcement particles, which is important in establishing more novel aluminium based composites. Composites with nearly full density (> 99 % theoretical density) were successfully produced via this method. The unreinforced aluminium specimens were relatively easy to extrude and defect-free extrusions can be produced in a range of parameters. The composite material not only required a higher extrusion load, but also produced a small amount of surface defects resulting sub-optimal surface finishing. A suitable remedy is to use aluminium foil or an aluminium disc in front of the extrusion for the composite material. The foil or disc acts a solid lubricant for the hard composite material, which significantly improves the surface finishing. Using this method, crack free extrusions can be obtained at reinforcement contents up to 30 volume percent silicon carbide. Microstructural analysis using optical and electron microscopies shows the particle dispersion in the material is relative homogenous. However, particle banding and alignment are observed along the extrusion direction of the specimens. Transmission electron microscope analysis shows the particle/matrix interface is free of any major reaction, but a small layer of inter-diffusion occurred between silicon and aluminium. The sub-structure of the material adjacent to the silicon carbide particle is observed to be sub-micron. This can be related to particle –assisted nucleation during extrusion and possibly the effect of high dislocation density near the particle-matrix interface, which produces a very fine structure. Mechanical testing showed the composite reinforced with silicon carbide (1200 mesh, 13 micron) possessed a significant improvement in mechanical strength and stiffness as compared to the unreinforced material. The improvement did not diminish with increasing in reinforcement volume fraction, but follows a linear trend. This increase is related to the load transfer from the matrix to the reinforcement, the generation of thermal dislocations (which is related to the difference in co-efficient of thermal expansion between the matrix and reinforcement particles) and the small substructure near the particle-matrix interface. However, composites reinforced with the larger 65 micron SiC particle did not show any significant improvement in mechanical strength, but the ductility of the sample was reduced significantly. This is because the large reinforcement particles are easy to fracture during tensile loading because of high intrinsic flaw density. Once particles are broken, the load cannot be effectively transferred from the matrix to the reinforcement, therefore the improvement in mechanical strength is reduced. Short-term corrosion testing in 3. 5 wt. % NaCl solution (24 -hour immersion) of the composite material showed that they did not suffer accelerated corrosion as compare to the unreinforced material. The short term immersion tests were performed because they offer a quick analysis of the corrosion performance of the composite material. The corrosion rate and the polarization resistance of the composite material are similar to the unreinforced material. Although pitting corrosion near the particle-matrix interface are observed in the composite material. However, {{it is likely that the}} volume expansion of the corrosion product has filled up any voids near the interface, which can inhibit further ingress of the corrosive media into the material. The overall electrochemical behaviour of the aluminium was not significantly affected by the reinforcement addition during the short-term corrosion test. Pin on disc wear testing was also conducted on the aluminium composite, using a ruby pin and with the aluminium material as the disc material. The unreinforced aluminium showed high wear rate with continuous delamination. The wear tracks of the specimens are measured to be very deep and wide. However, the composite material with 10 vol. % SiC reinforcement showed substantial improvement in wear resistance with about 4 times lower wear rate. When the volume fraction is increased to 20 %, an order of magnitude reduction in wear rate was obtained and the wear co-efficient is about 7 times lower than as compare to the unreinforced material. However, the corrosion resistance of the composite, especially at high volume fraction is significantly reduced as compare to the unreinforced material...|$|E

40|$|<b>Sintering</b> {{of light}} <b>aluminium</b> alloys powder has been {{investigated}} {{as a way to}} substitute steels in automotive and aerospace industries. Premix Al- 5. 5 Zn- 2. 5 Mg- 0. 5 Cu composite powder called Alumix 431 D was analyzed in this research. Sintering was carried out under ultra high purity nitrogen gas and before reaching sintering temperature, green samples were delubricated at 400 °C for 30 [*]min. The powder possesses high sinterability by reaching 96 % relative density at 580 °C sintering temperature. Formation of liquid phase seems to support achieving high sintering density. Optimum mechanical properties also were obtained under those conditions. T 6 heat treatment was done to improve the mechanical properties by formation of precipitation strengthening, and MgZn 2 appears to be dominant strengthening precipitate.

40|$|The {{effects of}} warm {{compaction}} {{on the green}} density and <b>sintering</b> behaviour of <b>aluminium</b> alloys were investigated. Particular {{attention is paid to}} prealloyed powders, i. e. eutectic and hypereutectic Al-Si alloys, regarding their potential applications in the automotive industry. The effects of chemical composition, alloying method, compacting temperature and the amount of powder lubricant were studied. The compaction behaviour was examined by an instrumented die enabling simultaneous measurement of density, die wall friction coefficient, the triaxial stresses acting on the powder during the course of compaction and ejection pressure. The sintering behiiviour was studied via dilatometeric analysis as. well as normal batch sintering. The results show that warm compaction could be a promising way to increase the green density of aluminium alloys, especially prealloyed powders, and to decrease dimensional instability during sintering. Moreover, it reduces the sliding friction coefficient and the ejection force during the powder shaping process.
