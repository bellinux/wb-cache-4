He taught in Oba for four months, but when an opportunity arose in 1954 to work for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS), he left the school and moved to Lagos.|$|E
5|$|Sources differ {{about the}} cities hosting {{some of the}} early IMOs. This may be partly because leaders are {{generally}} housed well away from the students, and partly because after the competition the <b>students</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> always stay based in one city {{for the rest of the}} IMO. The exact dates cited may also differ, because of leaders arriving before the students, and at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leaders.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Abbe {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom. He went at {{the invitation}} of the London Judo Society (LJS), and was the first master to teach aikido in the UK. That year, he demonstrated aikido at the LJS and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Abbe came to experience two problems at the LJS: first, he felt that the students there were more concerned with competition than his theories, and second, he felt that the <b>students</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> treat him with the appropriate respect for someone of his rank and experience in the martial arts. According to the International Budo Council (IBC), he founded the IBC in 1955.|$|E

50|$|Current {{practice}} is {{to notify the}} student's parent if the <b>student</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> participate {{in the practice of}} religion. Reports can be made, for example, a one-time enrollment at school or in each case. After notification, the school must ensure that the <b>student</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> participate in these events. The school is responsible for student safety, even when the <b>student</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> participate in the school to organize a religious ceremony. The school organizes the student the opportunity for a period of other activities. In high school, notification is made by the student himself.|$|R

5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century the colony's ethnic Chinese {{population}} was severely undereducated, unable to enter schools for either Europeans or natives. Aged ten, Lie {{was enrolled in a}} Calvinist missionary school run by Christiaan Albers. This school had roughly 60male students, mostly Chinese. Under Albers, a fluent speaker of Sundanese, he received his formal education in a curriculum which included the sciences, language, and Christianity– the schools were meant to promote Christianity in the Dutch East Indies, and students were required to pray before class. Lie, as with most <b>students,</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> convert, although biographer Tio Ie Soei writes that an understanding of Christianity likely affected his world view.|$|E

As many as one third of Santa Barbara School District <b>students</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> attend classes.

25|$|This {{phenomenon}} is apparently unrelated to musical training. The skill {{may be associated}} more closely with vocal production. Violin students learning the Suzuki method are required to memorize each composition in a fixed key and play it from memory on their instrument, {{but they are not}} required to sing. When tested, these <b>students</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> succeed in singing the memorized Suzuki songs in the original, fixed key.|$|E
25|$|At {{three o'clock}} Father William Corby, the University president, {{met with his}} wisest assistants and they {{determined}} that nothing could be done but close the college for the year. An hour after he communicated the decision to the students assembled in the church. <b>Students</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to leave, but Fr. Corby {{made it clear that}} the University could not provide any accommodations. Hence, the students were sent home for the semester. The loss was estimated at $200,000 and only $45,000 was recovered from the insurance. It was a terrible blow, for in three hours was wiped out the result of thirty-five years of hard, grueling sacrifice.|$|E

25|$|Given {{that the}} sole purpose of Jamaica College from 1903 onwards was to train {{potential}} university students in the days when the University of the West Indies did not exist, in practice most <b>students</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> go further than fourth or fifth forms. That was considered sufficient education for just about any managerial or clerical job in Jamaica. It was also considered uneconomical to run a school of less than eighty boys, and therefore a deliberate attempt to expand the school to include those of parents who were able to afford the fees was embarked upon. By the 1930s, the student population rose to over one hundred and fifty.|$|E
25|$|In 1769, {{the first}} year of operation, the Schools {{enrolled}} 77 students. By 1830 over 1,500 students had enrolled in the Schools, giving an average intake of 25 students each year. They included men such as John Flaxman, J. M. W. Turner, John Soane, Thomas Rowlandson, William Blake, Thomas Lawrence, John Constable, George Hayter, David Wilkie, William Etty and Edwin Landseer. The term of studentship was at first six years. This was increased to seven years in 1792 and to ten in 1800; it remained at ten till 1853. These figures must be regarded, however, only as years of eligibility. Likely many of the <b>students</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> complete their full term, but there are no records of attendance and termination of studentships from the early years.|$|E
25|$|North Dakota was {{far away}} from the centers of the hippie {{movement}} on the coasts of the United States, but this did not mean that the local <b>students</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{know what was going on}} with their peers at schools such as UC-Berkeley. The combination of tension between the students and the established powers, and the local and state governments' lack of experience in dealing with large gatherings of angry and drunk protesters led to the riot that would put Zap, North Dakota across the headlines of the U.S. newspapers and make it the lead story on the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. What started out as a lark turned into a riot that resulted in thousands of dollars of damage.|$|E

25|$|Private tuition is {{a lucrative}} {{industry}} in Singapore, since many parents {{send their children}} for private tuition after school. A straw poll by The Straits Times newspaper in 2008 found that out of 100 students interviewed, only 3 <b>students</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have any form of tuition. In 2010, the Shin Min Daily News estimated that there were around 540 tuition centres offering private tuition in Singapore. Due to their high demand, tuition centres are able to charge high fees for their services; they have an annual turnover of SGD$110.6 million in 2005. However, this industry is largely unregulated, though tuition centres are required to be registered with the Ministry of Education. There is no such requirement for individual private tutors.|$|E
25|$|Roanoke {{was one of}} the few Southern {{colleges that}} {{remained}} open throughout the American Civil War. The student body was organized into a corps of cadets and fought with Confederate forces near Salem in December 1863. The students were outmatched and quickly forced to surrender, but the Union commander paroled them and allowed them to return to their studies. The college company was formally mustered into the Confederate Army, Virginia Reserves, on September 1, 1864, but the <b>students</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> see combat before the war ended. A monument honoring Salem's Confederate soldiers, dedicated in 1909 by the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, is on the grounds of the former Roanoke County courthouse, which is now a college academic building.|$|E
25|$|Science {{education}} at Yale College came in 1802 with {{the appointment of}} Benjamin Silliman as professor of chemistry. Although Silliman was given a basement laboratory on Old Brick Row, sciences were marginal within the university's buildings and curriculum over {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century. In 1847, the Sheffield Scientific School was founded as a separate school of Yale, and it began expanding its campus between the university's main campus and Sachem's Wood. Although a corporate entity of the university, the school was socially and administratively segregated from the rest of Yale; Yale College <b>students</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> attend its classes, and Sheffield students lived in societies and dormitories separate from the undergraduate college. Over time, the division caused Yale's science education and research efforts to suffer.|$|E

Furthermore, it was contended that this damage constituted a threat to {{public health and safety}} and the MBTA would suffer irreparable harm if the students were allowed to present; that the students converted and trespassed on MBTA property; that the students illegally profited from their activities; and that MIT itself was negligent in supervising the undergraduates and notifying the MBTA.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Match Game {{kept its}} high {{standing}} in the ratings despite a short-lived move ahead one half-hour from August to December 1975. In November 1977, however, CBS made a fatal mistake regarding the show's time slot. Noting a ratings boon resulted when The Price Is Right and Match Game were paired in afternoons, a major hole in the schedule had developed in the morning slot that The Price Is Right had left behind. In an attempt to resolve the crisis, CBS moved Match Game to 11:00 a.m., immediately following The Price Is Right at 10:00 a.m. However, because much of Match Games audience was composed of students who were in school {{at that time of}} day, ratings began to sag and eventually free fall; many of these <b>students</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> return. As a result, Family Feud quickly supplanted Match Game as television's highest-rated game show.|$|E
25|$|On February 3, {{in front}} of Ministry of Education {{headquarter}} in Naypyidaw, the students announced {{that they would be}} resuming their nationwide protests. Earlier that day, the government declared that the second quadripartite meeting was postponed after refusing to allow extra attendees who came along with the students to the meeting. During the meeting, Aung Min read out a letter, which he claimed to have just received from the president. The letter suggested that the meeting should be postponed and the government representatives decided to follow the president’s advice after a discussion. That early afternoon, the Ministry of Information released photos of government delegates standing in an empty room with a caption saying that the <b>students</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> show up to the meeting. Later that day, the government announced that the meeting would be postponed until February 12. The student leaders, meanwhile, declared that they have students ready to continue marching to Yangon from different parts of the country, including Mandalay in the north, Pathein in the southwest and Dawei in the south. On the same day, Aung San Su Kyi confirmed her opinions on the current protests, asking Thein Lwin to resign from his position in the central executive committee if he wanted to pursue his work with NNER. Initially silent on the topic, U Thein Lwin said in a press conference on February 3 that he would accept NLD's decision.|$|E
