40|$|Almost <b>self-centered</b> graphs were {{recently}} introduced as the graphs with exactly two non-central vertices. In this paper we characterize almost <b>self-centered</b> graphs among median graphs and among chordal graphs. In {{the first case}} P 4 and the graphs obtained from hypercubes by attaching to them a single leaf are the only such graphs. Among chordal graph the variety of almost <b>self-centered</b> graph is much richer, {{despite the fact that}} their diameter is at most 3. We also discuss almost <b>self-centered</b> graphs among partial cubes and among k-chordal graphs, classes of graphs that generalize median and chordal graphs, respec-tively. Characterizations of almost <b>self-centered</b> graphs among these two classes seem elusive...|$|R

2500|$|In a [...] {{flight test}} report, Francis Donaldson, the LAA's Chief Engineer, {{declared}} that although some design compromises were [...] "clearly not ideal", [...] overall he felt [...] "very impressed with Michel Colomban's new creation", saying the aircraft [...] "performed as claimed, was practical and fun". [...] Donaldson's major criticism {{was that the}} elevator's GRP spring (to provide <b>self-centering</b> and to impart [...] "feel") was in the cockpit {{and not in the}} tail, so that if the elevator control linkage failed, the aircraft could suffer catastrophic lack of pitch-control as [...] "the Luciole would most likely be totally unflyable". [...] However, Colomban has disclosed plans to [...] "modify the system to relocate the tailplane's <b>self-centering</b> trim spring in the rear fuselage, attaching directly to the tailplane .... so a failure of the (linkage) would no longer be disastrous".|$|E
2500|$|Trapezoidal thread {{forms are}} screw thread {{profiles}} with trapezoidal outlines. They {{are the most}} common forms used for leadscrews (power screws). They offer high strength and ease of manufacture. They are typically found where large loads are required, as in a vise or the leadscrew of a lathe. Standardized variations include multiple-start threads, left-hand threads, and <b>self-centering</b> threads (which are less likely to bind under lateral forces).|$|E
2500|$|The first verifiable {{claim for}} a {{practically}} used bicycle belongs to German Baron Karl von Drais, a civil servant to the Grand Duke of Baden in Germany. [...] Drais invented his Laufmaschine (German for [...] "running machine") in 1817, that was called Draisine (English) or draisienne (French) by the press. Karl von Drais [...] patented this design in 1818, {{which was the}} first commercially successful two-wheeled, steerable, human-propelled machine, commonly called a velocipede, and nicknamed hobby-horse or dandy horse. It was initially manufactured in Germany and France. Hans-Erhard Lessing (Drais' biographer) found from circumstantial evidence that Drais' interest in finding an alternative to the horse was the starvation and death of horses caused by crop failure in 1816, the Year Without a Summer following the volcanic eruption of Tambora in 1815). [...] On his first reported ride from Mannheim on June 12, 1817, he covered 13km (eight miles) in less than an hour. Constructed almost entirely of wood, the draisine weighed 22kg (48 pounds), had brass bushings within the wheel bearings, iron shod wheels, a rear-wheel brake and 152mm (6inches) of trail of the front-wheel for a <b>self-centering</b> caster effect. [...] This design was welcomed by mechanically minded men daring to balance, and several thousand copies were built and used, primarily in Western Europe and in North America. Its popularity rapidly faded when, partly due to increasing numbers of accidents, some city authorities began to prohibit its use. However, in 1866 Paris a Chinese visitor named Bin Chun could still observe foot-pushed velocipedes.|$|E

50|$|A <b>self-centering</b> chuck, {{also known}} as a , uses dogs (usually called jaws), {{interconnected}} via a scroll gear (scroll plate), to hold onto a tool or workpiece. Because they most often have three jaws, the term three-jaw chuck without other qualification is understood by machinists to mean a <b>self-centering</b> three-jaw chuck. The term universal chuck also refers to this type. These chucks are best suited to grip circular or hexagonal cross-sections when very fast, reasonably accurate (±0.005 inch mm TIR) centering is desired.|$|E

A pair of tweezers-type grippers would hold the part while centering it along one axis. However, there are some disadvantages with <b>self-centering</b> mechanical grippers: {{it is possible that the}} gripper edges could have contact with epoxy or solder paste. In addition, extra space is required between the components to accommodate the grippers.|$|E
