5|$|Lead-ions (Pb), like magnesium-ions (Mg), blocks NMDA receptors. Since {{the normal}} Pb {{concentration}} in the extracellular fluid is low (adult average of 120mg), even a low increase in Pb concentration has a <b>significant</b> <b>positive</b> affect on the blockage of NMDA-receptors. Therefore, an increase in Pb concentration, will, effectively, inhibit ongoing long-term potentiations (LTPs), and lead to an abnormal increase long-term depression (LDPs) on neurons on the effected parts of the nervous system. These abnormalities lead to the indirect downregulation of NMDA-receptors, effectively initiating a positive feedback-loop for LDP. The targeting of NMDA receptors {{is thought to be}} one of the main causes for lead's toxicity to neurons.|$|E
