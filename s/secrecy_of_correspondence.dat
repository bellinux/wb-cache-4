50|$|In the United States {{there is}} no {{specific}} constitutional guarantee on the privacy <b>of</b> <b>correspondence.</b> The <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> letters and <b>correspondence</b> is derived through litigation from the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an 1877 case the U.S. Supreme Court stated:No law of Congress can place {{in the hands of}} officials connected with the Postal Service any authority to invade the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> letters and such sealed packages in the mail; and all regulations adopted as to mail matter of this kind must be in subordination to the great principle embodied in the fourth amendment of the Constitution.|$|R

His removal from the position of Royal Governor of Chiloé was related to his violation the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> of local Jesuits.|$|E
50|$|The <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> (Briefgeheimnis, secret de la correspondance) or {{literally}} {{translated as}} secrecy of letters, {{is a fundamental}} legal principle enshrined in the constitutions of several European countries. It guarantees that the content of sealed letters is never revealed and letters in transit are not opened by government officials or any other third party. It is thus the main legal basis for the assumption of privacy of correspondence.|$|E

Pergen wanted to unify the system of internal security in the hereditary lands in a centralized and modernized form. He emphasised the role of discipline, based on the French model. The Emperor originally wanted him to just organise the secret police, while {{the responsibility for the}} rest of the police would fall to the Chancellery (Hofkanzlei). As Joseph's unpopularity increased he came to rely more and more on Pergen who hired more agents. In addition he controlled the Kabinettskanzlei which guarded the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> state <b>correspondence.</b> He was able to use this for his own espionage and had all suspicious mail directed there.|$|R

One, and, {{that the}} highest, of her abstruse negotiations, cherished, labored in, these {{fourteen}} years, she has brought to a victorious issue,--has she not? Her poor Mother, once so radiant, now so dim and angry, shut in the Castle of Ahlden, does not approve this Double-Marriage; not she for her part;--as indeed evil to all Hanoverian interests is now chiefly her good, poor Lady; and she is growing {{more and more of}} a Megaera every day.

A protection {{similar to that of}} correspondence has even been argued to extend to the contents of trash cans outside one's house, although unsuccessfully. Like all rights derived through litigation, the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> is subject to interpretations.

50|$|Classification as a {{dead letter}} {{is one of}} the few {{instances}} where postal personnel are allowed to violate <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>correspondence,</b> ostensibly to search for clues as to the letter's origin or destination.

Some very valuable items have turned up in undeliverable mail, including a stolen painting by Marc Chagall which turned up in a United States Postal Service sorting center in Topeka, Kansas.|$|E

5000|$|Separate {{from the}} {{question}} of whether the database is illegal under FISA, one may ask whether the call detail records are covered by the privacy protection of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. This is unclear.

50|$|Such postal {{censorship}} became common during World War I. Governments {{claimed that the}} total war which was waged required such censorship to preserve the civilian population's morale from heart-breaking news up from the front. Whatever the justification, this meant that not a single letter sent from a soldier to his family escaped previous reading by a government official, destroying any notion of privacy or of <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>correspondence.</b> Post censorship was retained during the interwar period and afterwards, but without being done on such a massive scale.|$|E

It is already illegal to use it in some countries, and export laws are restrictive in others. Citizens in the United Kingdom must, upon request, give keys for decryption of personal systems to authorities. Failing to do this can result in imprisonment for up to two years, without evidence of other criminal activity.|$|E

50|$|Email {{privacy is}} the broad topic dealing {{with issues of}} {{unauthorized}} access and inspection of electronic mail. This unauthorized access can happen while an email is in transit, as well as when it is stored on email servers or on a user computer. In countries with a constitutional guarantee of the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>correspondence,</b> whether email can be equated with letters and get legal protection from all forms of eavesdropping comes under question because of {{the very nature of}} email. This is especially important as relatively more communication occurs via email compared to via postal mail.|$|E

This law proposal was presented to the Italian Parliament by deputy Maurizio Turco in 2006. This law proposal was not accepted.

They {{were published in}} 1971 as Medvedev Papers by Macmillan in London. These works were widely circulated in the USSR among scientists, and this activity resulted in Medvedev's arrest and forced detention in the Kaluga psychiatric hospital in May 1970. However, this action produced many protests from prominent scientists (Academics Andrei Sakharov, Pyotr Kapitsa, Igor Tamm, Vladimir Engelgardt, Boris Astaurov, Nikolai Semyonov, and others) and well-known writers (Solzhenitsyn, Tvardovsky, Vladimir Tendryakov, Vladimir Dudintsev, etc.) which resulted in Medvedev's release (this experience was reflected in Zhores Medvedev's and Roy Medvedev's book A Question of Madness, published by Macmillan in London in 1971).|$|E
50|$|Since Zersetzung as a whole, {{even after}} 1990, was not {{deemed to be}} illegal because of the {{principle}} of nulla poena sine lege (no penalty without law), actions against involvement in either its planning or implementation were not enforceable by the courts. Because this specific legal definition of Zersetzung as a crime didn't exist, only individual instances of its tactics could be reported. Acts which even according to GDR law were offences (such as the violation of Briefgeheimnis, the <b>secrecy</b> <b>of</b> <b>correspondence)</b> needed to have been reported to the GDR authorities soon after having been committed in order not to be subject to a statute of limitations clause. Many of the victims experienced the additional complication that the Stasi was not identifiable as the originator in cases of personal injury and misadventure. Official documents in which Zersetzung methods were recorded often had no validity in court, and the Stasi had many files detailing its actual implementation destroyed.|$|E
