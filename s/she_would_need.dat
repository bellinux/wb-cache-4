5|$|U-30 {{began her}} first patrol {{operating}} from Lorient and her seventh overall on 13 July 1940. During {{a period of}} 12 days, she traveled {{as far south as}} Portugal and sank the 712-ton British ship Ellaroy on the 21st. Three days later, on 24 July, U-30 returned to Lorient, having experienced a malfunction in one of her engines. It then became clear that the boat was suffering a number of mechanical difficulties and as a result it was decided that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to be used sparingly. For her next patrol it was decided that she would leave from Lorient, but would return to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about her}} role in voicing Saya, Mizuki said that she {{initially}} thought <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to reimagine the entire character for her performance as Saya in the movie. It was later decided that the core character had changed little despite {{the events of the}} series finale, so Mizuki did not have to adjust her performance by much. Mizuki worked with the staff to help portray Saya's strained condition and deliberate isolation from others after the trauma of the series' events, although the sense of love still formed a strong part of Saya's character. Hashimoto's role as Mana was her first role in an anime movie, which proved challenging as Hashimoto needed to adjust to a new work environment, in particular performing convincingly without acting physically. She accepted the part based on her liking for CLAMP's manga work, recording all her lines separate {{from the rest of the}} cast. Fukuyama voiced Watanuki, making a cameo appearance from CLAMP's manga series xxxHolic. For the character's role in The Last Dark, Fukuyama needed to portray Watanuki as a mature character despite not aging from his appearance in xxxHolic.|$|E
25|$|Artemis {{believed}} {{that she had been}} chosen by the Fates to be a midwife, particularly since she had assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin brother, Apollo. All of her companions remained virgins, and Artemis closely guarded her own chastity. Her symbols included the golden bow and arrow, the hunting dog, the stag, and the moon. Callimachus tells how Artemis spent her girlhood seeking out the things that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to be a huntress, how she obtained her bow and arrows from the isle of Lipara, where Hephaestus and the Cyclops worked.|$|E
60|$|I pretended, after I {{had been}} there some time, to be {{extremely}} {{in love with the}} dress of the Quakers, and this pleased her so much that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>needs</b> dress me up one day in a suit of her own clothes; but my real design was to see whether it would pass upon me for a disguise.|$|R
60|$|If {{she became}} an heiress <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>need</b> to teach, {{but she was}} not at all {{confident}} of her prospects, and the girl's practical nature prompted her to carry out her plans until she was sure of the future.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Brian Keith kept {{in touch}} with Jones through letters and offered her a young-adult role on The Brian Keith Show (1972-1974). Keith told her <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>need</b> to {{audition}} for the part, but, by then, Jones no longer wanted to work in television.|$|R
25|$|In the 1960s, a {{young woman}} nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is {{institutionalized}} by her abusive widowed stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the fictional Lennox House for the Mentally Insane in Brattleboro, Vermont, after she is blamed for her younger sister's death. The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to attempt an escape.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the end of}} {{her studies}} at the University of Leipzig, Merkel sought an {{assistant}} professorship at an engineering school. As a condition for getting the job, Merkel was told <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to agree to report on her colleagues to the Stasi, the GDR's secret police. Merkel declined, using the excuse that she could not keep secrets well enough to be an effective spy. Merkel worked and studied at the Central Institute for Physical Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin-Adlershof from 1978 to 1990. After being awarded a doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) for her thesis on quantum chemistry in 1986, she worked as a researcher and published several papers.|$|E
25|$|The killings resumed on January 29, 1974, {{with five}} more shootings. Tana Smith, 32, was shot while walking to a fabric store. Vincent Wollin, 69, was shot while walking home. John Bambic, 84, was shot while {{collecting}} discarded bottles and cans. Jane Holly, a 45-year-old housewife, {{was gunned down}} while doing her laundry in a laundromat, and Roxanne McMillian, 23, was shot while carrying items from her car to her new apartment. Of these, only McMillian survived, although <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to use a wheelchair {{for the rest of}} her life. A sixth victim who was shot that night, Thomas Bates, a hitchhiker who survived being shot three times near Emeryville, had earlier been mentioned by author Howard, but not counted by him in that night's totals.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{the false}} church sprang up, and mounted the chair; but, though {{she lost her}} nature, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>needs</b> keep her good name of the Lamb's bride, the true church, and mother of the faithful: {{constraining}} all to receive her mark, either in their forehead, or right-hand; that is, publicly, or privately. But, in deed and in truth, she was mystery Babylon, the mother of harlots, mother of those that, with all their show and outside of religion, were adulterated and gone from the spirit, nature, and life of Christ, and grown vain, worldly, ambitious, covetous, cruel, &c. which are {{the fruits of the}} flesh, and not of the spirit.|$|R
50|$|Jennifer {{tried to}} stop the Thunderbolts from using Man-Thing as their transportation, recalling him to the swamp to fight off an {{invasion}} from the Nexus of All Realities. Eventually, she realized that Man-Thing was willingly working with the Thunderbolts, and that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> simply <b>need</b> to alert him any time someone broke through.|$|R
60|$|Amy was {{concerned}} {{at it as}} well as I, but could not help it; and though it gave us great uneasiness, yet, as there was no remedy, we were bound to make as little noise of it as we could, that it might go no farther. I bade Amy punish the girl for it, and she did so, for she parted with her in a huff, and told her she should see she was not her mother, for that she could leave her just where she found her; and seeing she could not be content to be served by the kindness of a friend, but that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>needs</b> make a mother of her, <b>she</b> <b>would,</b> for the future, be neither mother or friend, and so bid her go to service again, and be a drudge as she was before.|$|R
25|$|Females {{who carry}} one {{copy of the}} {{defective}} gene are carriers with a 50% chance of passing the disease on to their sons. In order for a female to be affected, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to have two copies of the mutated gene, one {{of which would be}} inherited from her father. Males affected with LNS do not usually have children due to the debilitating effects of the disease. It is possible for a female to inherit an X chromosome from her unaffected father, who carries a new mutation of the HGPRT gene. Under these circumstances, a girl could be born with LNS, and though there are a few reports of this happening, it is very rare. The overwhelming majority of patients with LNS are male.|$|E
25|$|According to Xuazang, the {{introduction}} of sericulture to Khotan occurred {{in the first quarter}} of the 5th century. The King of Khotan wanted to obtain silkworm eggs, mulberry seeds and Chinese know-how - the three crucial components of silk production. The Chinese court had strict rules against these items leaving China, to maintain the Chinese monopoly on silk manufacture. Xuanzang wrote that the King of Khotan asked for the hand of a Chinese princess in marriage as a token of his allegiance to the Chinese emperor. The request was granted, and an ambassador was sent to the Chinese court to escort the Chinese princess to Khotan. He advised the princess that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to bring silkworms and mulberry seeds in order to make herself robes in Khotan and to make the people prosperous. The princess concealed silkworm eggs and mulberry seeds in her headdress and smuggled them through the Chinese frontier. According to his text, silkworm eggs, mulberry trees and weaving techniques passed from Khotan to India, and from there eventually reached Europe.|$|E
500|$|In {{support of}} her sixth studio album, Bionic, Aguilera {{announced}} plans for the Bionic Tour. However, on May 24, 2010, the singer and tour promoter Live Nation both posted messages on their websites stating that due to excessive promotion of Bionic and preparing for her upcoming film debut in Burlesque, she felt <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> more time {{to be able to}} put together a show that her fans deserve to see. Aguilera stated that this was not possible to do in less than one month between the release of the album and the start of the tour as <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> more time to rehearse. On the accompanying soundtrack for the film, Aguilera had worked with Tricky Stewart. Stewart was the co-writer and producer of two songs, [...] "Show Me How You Burlesque" [...] and [...] "Express", and also produced a number of tracks, including [...] "Something's Got a Hold on Me", [...] "Tough Lover" [...] and [...] "But I Am a Good Girl".|$|E
50|$|To take an example, Carl agrees {{in writing}} to sell Betty {{a car for}} $1,000, but later, Betty argues that Carl earlier told her that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> only <b>need</b> to pay Carl $800. The parol {{evidence}} rule would generally prevent Betty from testifying to this alleged conversation because the testimony ($800) would directly contradict the written contract's terms ($1,000).|$|R

500|$|In 1950, Heyer {{began working}} on what she called [...] "the magnum opus of my latter years", a medieval trilogy {{intended}} to cover the House of Lancaster between 1393 and 1435. She estimated that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> five years to complete the works. Her impatient readers continually clamored for new books; to satisfy them and her tax liabilities, Heyer interrupted herself to write Regency romances. The manuscript of volume one of the series, My Lord John, was published posthumously.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the turn}} of the millennium, the {{combination}} of hard and fast guitar riffs with classical female lead vocals attracted {{a great deal of attention}} in the metal scene. The new music style of Nightwish quickly achieved critical and commercial popularity; this symphonic metal style was soon dubbed [...] "opera metal". Turunen does not see herself as an opera singer. She has sung excerpts from operas at the Savonlinna Opera Festival, but she stresses that singing opera cannot be performed as a side project. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> special training to perfectly sing an entire opera without a microphone.|$|E
60|$|Various schemes {{were now}} proposed, {{but there were}} {{objections}} to all of them. Everyone was {{agreed that it was}} very unfortunate that this emergency should have arisen just at this time, because as soon as the company got into good working order, and the creek had been up a few times it was probable that Aunt Matilda would really have more money than <b>she</b> <b>would</b> absolutely <b>need.</b>|$|R

My Lord Rochester(8) is dead this morning; they say at one o'clock; and I hear he died suddenly. To-morrow I shall know more. He is a great loss to us: I cannot think who will succeed him as Lord President. I have been writing a long letter to Lord Peterborow, and am dull.|$|R

500|$|Georgette Heyer is {{best known}} for writing romantic stories set in the Regency era, but her body of work {{encompassed}} many different historical periods, including the English Civil War and the Middle Ages. One of her favoured periods centred on the House of Lancaster's peak of power, between 1393 and 1435. In 1950, Heyer began working on what she called [...] "the magnum opus of my latter years", a medieval trilogy intended to cover the House of Lancaster during that period.

500|$|In 2011, Omar {{fled the}} {{fighting}} {{of the civil}} war and moved to Addis Abeba, leaving her family behind, partly to pursue her dream of competing at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom. Now a middle-distance athlete, she was due to begin training with former Olympian Eshetu Tura, who was recommended to her by the prominent Qatar-based Somali track coach Jama Aden and the Olympic medalist Mohamed Suleiman. She was allowed to train with the middle distance Ethiopian team once approval from the Ethiopian Olympic Committee was received. Her personal best time when first meeting with the Ethiopian team was 5 minutes for the 1500 metres; it was made clear that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to meet 4:20 to be competitive.|$|E
50|$|A {{gold medal}} {{favorite}} entering her first Olympics, Kearney had a poor first run {{and did not}} make it out of the qualification round. She stumbled after landing her first jump. Her score of 20.80 points put her in 10th at that point, with 20 skiers left to compete. After the second-to-last skier, she was officially bumped out of the top 20, the ranking <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>needed</b> to advance to the final.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>would</b> be honest. Here, too, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have no <b>need</b> of allowances.

60|$|It is {{a change}} such as History must beg her readers to imagine, undescribed. An {{instantaneous}} change of the whole body-politic, the soul-politic being all changed; such a change as few bodies, politic or other, can experience in this world.

France has looked upon Democracy; seen it face to face.--The Cimmerian Invaders will rally, in humbler temper, with better or worse luck: the wreck and dissolution must reshape itself into a social Arrangement as it can and may.
