Beginning in 2007, Reyna dominated the award and remains the title holder as of 2015.|$|E
25|$|She {{returned}} to action in Toronto, reaching {{the third round}} after beating Elina Svitolina and third seed Petra Kvitová.

25|$|At Wimbledon, Henin lost to Marion Bartoli in {{the semifinals}} 6–1, 5–7, 1–6, one day after Henin {{defeated}} Serena Williams in the quarterfinals.

25|$|That September, {{she lost}} in the final of a $25,000 tournament to compatriot Zheng Jie, before {{returning}} to the WTA circuit, thanks to a wildcard entry into qualifying at the Beijing. There, she defeated Antonella Serra Zanetti, Marta Domachowska, and Nicole Pratt before losing in the deciding-set tie-break after a very close second-round main-draw tussle against newly crowned US Open Champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, during which she held match points against Kuznetsova. The Russian afterwards praised her Chinese opponent, stating that she had felt as though <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> against a top-5 player.|$|E
25|$|On September 1, 1977, Oregon Governor Robert W. Straub, {{a former}} opponent, {{appointed}} Roberts to the Oregon Court of Appeals {{to a new}} position, along with W. Michael Gillette, George M. Joseph, and John Buttler, when the court expanded from six to ten positions. Roberts {{was the first woman}} on that court, as well as the first on any appellate court in Oregon. The next year <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> for election to retain her seat on the court, and won the election to a full six-year term. While on the court she faced discrimination from some judges due to her gender, as the Chief Judge had been against the nomination of a woman to the court.|$|E
25|$|At the 2011 Andalucia Tennis Experience, Azarenka was the {{top seed}} and dropped only {{fourteen}} games {{on her way to}} the final. She defeated Irina-Camelia Begu in the final. Azarenka's victory, and Samantha Stosur's inability to defend her points at Charleston, ensured that Azarenka would reach a career high of world No. 5. She then participated in Belarus' 5–0 win over Estonia in the Fed Cup. In her next tournament the 2011 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, Azarenka retired after winning the first set of her first match, ending her 12-match winning streak. At the 2011 Madrid Masters, Azarenka was seeded fourth. She lost in the final in straight sets to Petra Kvitová, but still rose to a career-high world No. 4. Azarenka then reached the quarterfinals of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome, where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> a set before retiring to eventual champion Maria Sharapova.|$|E

25|$|The first singles {{semifinal}} match saw white group no. 1 Petra Kvitová and red group no. 2 Samantha Stosur. Kvitová was {{the only}} player {{to make it through}} the round robin undefeated, but she showed some cracks in her last match on Friday, falling behind 5–1 in the first set before rallying to beat Agnieszka Radwańska in straights. And although <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> an early break she had somewhat of a slowish start again against a confident Stosur, who came back to take the first set and eventually build a 7–5, 1–0 lead, with a break point to go up 7–5, 2–0. Just like she did before, though, Kvitová came alive when she needed to, winning six of the next eight games to take the second set 6–3, then racing ahead 5–0 in the third. Stosur made things exciting at the end by winning three straight games to close to 5–3, but the Wimbledon champion held on, closing out the US Open champion with a love hold 5–7, 6–3, 6–3. Both Kvitová and Stosur finished with clean winners-to-errors differentials (Kvitová 38–39, Stosur 16–18) but the biggest difference came in creating break point opportunities – Kvitová brought up 11 break points (converting on five) while Stosur only got six break points (converting on three).|$|E
25|$|In 1993, the Australian Government {{decided to}} {{purchase}} two ex-United States Navy Newport-class tank landing ships to replace Tobruk and the navy's training and sealift ship Jervis Bay in 1994. Plans {{were developed to}} place Tobruk in reserve or lease her to the Royal New Zealand Navy. While the New Zealand government was interested in obtaining a sealift ship, the RNZN {{did not feel that}} it could afford to crew and operate Tobruk and the negotiations with New Zealand ended unsuccessfully in September 1994. The unexpected difficulty of converting the two LSTs into the Kanimbla class led to the date of Tobruk retirement being postponed to mid-1996, with the ship continuing normal operations. After the negotiations with New Zealand ended, the RAN opened negotiations with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, which was considering scrapping one of their Round Tables and replacing it with Tobruk. A British team travelled to Australia to inspect the ship in December 1994, but this sale did not eventuate. The Portuguese Navy expressed interest in buying Tobruk in 1995 and sent a team to Sydney in 1996 to inspect the ship. During this period Tobruk remained in active service, and in 1997 the new Liberal Party government decided to retain her until 2010 as the two LSTs could not fully replace her ability to carry heavy equipment. The period of uncertainty about the ship's fate led to a deterioration in her material condition, as she did not receive a major refit during the period <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> for sale.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{her early}} career {{is filled with}} near misses in casting, as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> for {{significant}} roles in films such as 1997's The Postman and The Devil's Advocate and 2000's Meet the Parents, which eventually went to other actresses. In an interview in 2012, Watts said, [...] "I came to New York and auditioned {{at least five times}} for Meet the Parents. I think the director liked me but the studio didn't. I heard every piece of feedback you could imagine, and in this case, it was 'not sexy enough'." [...] Watts recalled her early career in an interview in 2002, saying, [...] "It is a tough town. I think my spirit has taken a beating. The most painful thing has been the endless auditions. Knowing that you have something to offer, but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for things I did not have any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit." [...] Watts studied the Meisner Technique.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{felt that}} comedy {{was more of}} her repertoire, and {{proceeded}} to sign a comedy film titled Slammer, written by Andrew Smith and Ken Finkleman. She wanted to play {{the part of a}} street smart girl called Nikki Finn, who was jailed for a crime she did not commit. However, in light of the bad publicity surrounding her and Penn, and also of the very public failure of Shanghai Surprise, Madonna had to persuade producers Rosilyn Heller and Bernard Williams, as well as Warner Brothers, that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> for the part. In addition, she wanted an old friend, James Foley to direct the film. Foley had previously been Penn's best man at his marriage to Madonna, and had also directed the music videos of Madonna's singles [...] "Live to Tell" [...] (1986) and [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986). He was ecstatic at having the opportunity to make a major feature film, as previously he had only directed the small-budgeted film At Close Range, starring Penn. As author Andrew Morton pointed out in his biography on Madonna, [...] "the combination of a dubiously talented movie star and a first-time movie director hardly guaranteed a box-office hit, but the film received the go-ahead from Warner, who wanted to encache more on Madonna's success." [...] Madonna plowed gamely on, saying: [...] "All Warner's executives were real positive about the project. It was a process—with the writers—of honing the script, making it better." ...|$|E

The role ultimately went to Ellen Page, and Grace later revealed {{that she had}} never been contacted about the role and was surprised to read that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> for the part in question. Grace's next role was in the 2007 independent film Suburban Girl, alongside Sarah Michelle Gellar and Alec Baldwin. In 2007, she starred in The Jane Austen Book Club, based on Karen Joy Fowler's novel of the same name. She is a fan of Jane Austen and had read Fowler's novel when it was released in 2004. When she was given the film's script, she met with the director Robin Swicord, with whom she says she [...] "geeked out", and was given the role of Allegra, an openly lesbian 20-year-old. After the filming of The Jane Austen Book Club was completed, Grace briefly returned to Hawaii to shoot a guest spot on the Lost season 3 episode [...] "Exposé". She starred in the 2008 thriller film Taken with Liam Neeson, who {{was at the top of}} a list of male actors Grace wished to work with that she had written just two months before she was cast. She played the lead in Simon Fellows' 2009 Malice in Wonderland, a modern adaptation of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In 2010, Grace starred in the drama Flying Lessons, and appeared opposite Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz in James Mangold's film Knight and Day, as well as in Faster, with Dwayne Johnson. Grace's busy schedule prevented her from returning as Shannon in [...] "LA X", the season premiere for Losts sixth and final season, but she eventually returned for the series finale [...] "The End".
