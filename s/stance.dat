40|$|In this paper, we {{inquire into}} the <b>stances</b> that {{designers}} take in their design activities. The {{setting in which}} we investigate this question is that of design critiques, where participants make their <b>stances</b> publicly available to one another. During a critique, participants use their bodies {{as a framework for}} mutual orientation and reference. Design concepts are not so much told as they are staged and performed, using multiple semiotic modalities, including gesture, speech, gaze, orientation, inscription, and artifact. In performing their design, participants adopt and shift between several identified <b>stances,</b> which we call inscriptional, third-person, first-person and phenomenal. During the critique, designers often mirror the <b>stances</b> of others, where failing to do so can lead to communication breakdown. Although analyzed in the social setting of the design critique, because these <b>stances</b> are made public, they can thus become internal resources that designers draw upon in design situations in which others are not present. Rather than representing epistemic states or “designerly ways of knowing,” we suggest that these <b>stances</b> represent “designerly ways of being. ...|$|R
