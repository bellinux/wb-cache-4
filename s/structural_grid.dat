2500|$|Arcos, a British-Soviet {{trading company}} that {{temporarily}} served as liaison between two countries without diplomatic ties, declared a public competition for its Moscow headquarters in 1924. The Vesnin brothers easily won the contest with a Brutalist, simple design emphasizing the <b>structural</b> <b>grid</b> of reinforced concrete and wraparound glazing. Moisei Ginzburg criticized the ‘’Arcos’’ draft as lacking any true novelty, which {{was expected of}} constructivist architecture: it {{was little more than}} a traditional office block wrapped in modern materials. Vesnins proposal became a model for numerous practical adaptations as the path of least resistance between novel concrete structure and traditional expectations of a [...] "solid" [...] facade. Critics like Ginzburg dubbed the emerging trend [...] "constructive style", opposed to true [...] "constructivism"; according to them, simple following the function was sufficient and needed no external stylistic cues, no aesthetics whether original or borrowed. According to Khan-Magomedov, by 1927 the Vesnins, fed up with indiscriminate copies of their own work, also subscribed to Ginzburg's opinion. Their Arcos did not materialize; actual Arcos building in Kitai-gorod was designed and built by former neoclassicist Vladimir Mayat in moderate [...] "constructive style".|$|E

50|$|The open {{living room}} is planned around a {{rectilinear}} <b>structural</b> <b>grid</b> whose dimensions are adjusted to suit the disposition of rooms above. This {{is in contrast to}} the conventional Modernist practice exemplified by the work of Le Corbusier by comparison with the sophisticated spatial composition of the ground floor. Aalto varies the dimensions of the <b>structural</b> <b>grid</b> in both directions, and the circular steel columns are randomly placed; in one case, they are tripped clad with wooden strips or bound with rattan, and in the library, one of the three columns in arbitrarily changed to concrete (early sketches also show it as free-form in plan). Aalto is at such pains to subvert any clear geometric reading of the structural and spatial organization that it comes as something of a discovery that the whole plan is in fact regulated by a series of squares. This is in contrast to Mies van der Rohe, by whom the <b>structural</b> <b>grid</b> was conceived as a regular counterpoint to the independent spatial disposition of the ‘free plan’.Although this geometry contributes to the formal discipline which underpins the episodic spatial composition, and is emblematic of an ‘ideal’ house, {{it is only in the}} dining room that one can directly sense the underlying order.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{is presented to}} compute nonlinear aeroelastic trim of highly flexible aircraft by coupling off-the-shelf solvers for structures and aerodynamics.

40|$|<b>Structural</b> <b>grids</b> (grid metastructures) {{supporting}} discrete pressure waves {{similar to}} the pressure waves in continuous media are considered. The grids consist of links capable of transmitting longitudinal pressure waves and nodes providing equal pressures {{on the ends of}} outgoing links. The pressures in the nodes are governed by finite-difference equations approximating, under certain conditions, the wave equation in free space. It is shown that the pressures in the nodes are determined by the acoustic velocities and impedances of links rather than by the coordinates of the nodes and the link lengths. Therefore, a grid approximating pressure waves in a region of uniform homogeneous space can be replaced by an equivalent “deformed” grid with other spatial coordinates of nodes but the same pressure waves in the nodes. In particular, a locally “stretched” equivalent grid can be found that, theoretically, provides a sufficiently large region free from nodes and links. This property makes it possible to use these grids to construct ultrabroadband acoustic cloaks...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the flutter boundary, {{transient}} loads of a supersonic fin, and the flutter with perturbation. Reduced order mode (ROM) based on Volterra Series is presented to calculate the flutter boundary, and CFD/CSD coupling is used to compute the transient aerodynamic load. The Volterra-based ROM is obtained using the derivative of unsteady aerodynamic step-response, and the infinite plate spline is used to perform interpolation of physical quantities between the fluid and the <b>structural</b> <b>grids.</b> The results show that inertia force plays a significant role in the transient loads, the moment cause by inertia force is lager than the aerodynamic force, because of the huge transient loads, structure may be broken by aeroelasticity below the flutter dynamic pressure. Perturbations of aircraft affect the aeroelastic response evident, the reduction of flutter dynamic pressure by rolling perturbation form 15. 4 % to 18. 6 % when Mach from 2. 0 to 3. 0.

CLASP Mk 4b was the incarnation used between 1969 and 1972, measurements were imperial using 4" [...] as the basic unit. Panels were multiples of this - that is 12 inches or 1 foot, 3 foot, 6 foot and 9 foot. The planning grid was 12x12 inches, and a <b>structural</b> <b>grid</b> of 36x36 inches. The preferred floor to ceiling heights were 8 ft and 10 ft. The structure was steel frame with a 6 ft bay. It was hung with external 10 ft by 3 ft pre-fabricated concrete panels. The interior partitions were built using plastic-faced, plasterboard-backed steel Stelvelite panels. There was a hung exposed-T ceiling with 36x36 inch mineral tiles. The void above was used for service ducting, heating, electric power and lighting. The system was not heavy which was important due to the difficult sub-soil, and quick to erect which was important due to the tight time scale. It was designed to have a 60-year life. Hindsight shows that the extensive voids were a design fault, and many CLASP buildings have been destroyed by fire and have posed an asbestos risk.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} the CFD modeling methodology and validation for steady-state, normal operation in a PWR fuel assembly. This work {{is part of}} a program that is developing a CFD methodology for modeling and predicting single-phase and two-phase flow conditions downstream of <b>structural</b> <b>grids</b> that have mixing devices. The purpose of the mixing devices (mixing vanes in this case) is to increase turbulence and improve heat transfer characteristics of the fuel assembly. The detailed CFD modeling methodology for single-phase flow conditions in PWR fuel assemblies was developed using the STAR-CD CFD code. This methodology includes the details of the computational mesh, the turbulence model used, and the boundary conditions applied to the model. The methodology was developed by benchmarking CFD results versus small-scale experiments. The experiments use PIV to measure the lateral flow field downstream of the grid, and thermal testing to determine the heat transfer characteristics of the rods downstream of the grid. The CFD results and experimental data presented in the paper provide validation of the single-phase flow modeling methodology. Two-phase flow CFD models are being developed to investigate two-phase conditions in PWR fuel assemblies, and these can be presented at a future CFD Workshop. 1...|$|R

I then use some frameworks for teaching based on Ference Marton’s notion of variation, some based on George Polya’s descriptions of mathematical thinking, some based on Jerome Bruner’s three modes of re-presentation, and one based on my own work on the structure of attention, in order to provide theory-based justifications for pedagogical and didactic choices that the <b>Structural</b> Variation <b>Grids</b> afford. These frameworks can be used to enhance and enrich the learning potential of particular instances of grids, but also any other mathematical task in any mathematical topic.

Designed within {{the geometry of}} a 17 foot by 17 foot <b>structural</b> <b>grid,</b> the Irregular plan fits within a rectangle measuring 187 feet (11 bays! by 221 feet (13 bays). Distinctive features include the uniquely detailed structural system, flat roofs with parapet embattlements, arcades with segmental arches, and towers topped with red tile roofs and curve linear parapets. The portion of the hotel constructed in 1912 and 1913 was viewed as only an initial phase of development by Dr. Chandler, the owner, and Arthur B, Benton, the architect: [...] "The hotel building will be of {{reinforced concrete}} construction and will have all the latest improvements in hotel buildings. Many of the rooms will be provided with private sleeping balconies. The portion {{which is to be}} built at once includes 35 guest rooms, but plans for the entire structure of about 200 rooms are outlined and so arranged that construction of additional wings and stories can proceed without interfering in any way with the hotel business". The original portion of the hotel is [...] "Z" [...] shaped with the north wing (placed {{on the corner of the}} block north to south, 68 feet by 136 feet extending west and the south wing (placed right up to the southeast corner of the block, 68 feet by 119 feet) extending east. The connecting wing (measuring 51 feet by 85 feet) ts slightly higher but compatible. In plan and elevation the building reflects the original Intention of extending wings to the north and construction of at least one additional floor, with the unusual parapet embattlements really nothing more than the base for the next story. Major additions never occurred because additional rooms were gained by constructing clustered [...] "Bungalows" [...] (eventually numbering 3.0 to the west of the main hotel building. The open spaces formed by the building mass to the northeast and southwest became a patio and a garden respectively. The patio was framed on the north and east by a pergola constructed of Tuscan columns and heavy timber trellis work. The pergola also extended around the east and south facades of the south wing, but only the north portion remains, enclosed as office space. The main image of the building is one of continuous but varied solid and void juxtapositions, with all voids topped by semicircular or segmental arches. On the ground floor this is expressed in the continuous Inset arcade along the south and west sides of the patio leading to the hotel entry. The segmental arches have square piers with beveled corners and corbelled imposts at the spring line. A passageway connects through the building to the west garden and originally connected south through the middle of the south wing to the street.

[...] She recalls that lineage as a prominent {{part of her}} own work, where visually, [...] "The paintings were moving towards white but {{there was some kind}} of grid that kept being laid down and re-established." [...] Scholar Thomas Zummer characterizes those early paintings through their grids: [...] "Thornton's paintings organized a sensual, expressionist hand into strict formal geometric mappings. These works begin with a painterly sensuality set within and against a series of <b>structural</b> <b>grids,</b> so that there is a constant between expressivity and the ineffable." [...] But as her practice developed, he notes, [...] "Painting was a vessel incapable of the containment of the sensate. Language, gesture, emotion the random and inexplicable things and occurrences of the world were among her subjects; painting seemed insufficient. It was a matter of finding an appropriate instrument for her investigations". Painting's insufficiency led Thornton to her first venture in filmmaking, X-TRACTS, in 1975 while studying painting at the Hartford School of Art (though she was familiar with film theory from her undergraduate coursework at SUNY-Buffalo). After graduating, she abandoned painting in favor of filmmaking, which felt to her, despite Zummer's claims, entirely unrelated to her previous practice: [...] "I dropped thinking of what I had been doing with painting once I started the process of making film. I didn't draw comparisons though I probably could now, if I thought about it." [...] Filmmaking has dominated her work since this transition, though she recently began painting again as a hobby.|$|R
