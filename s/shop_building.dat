5|$|Located at 225 North Avenue NW in Midtown Atlanta, it {{was erected}} in 1888 as the Academic Building, with {{classrooms}} {{to complement the}} hands-on training in the adjacent <b>shop</b> <b>building.</b> It was the second edifice completed on the Georgia Tech campus {{and it is the}} oldest surviving one.|$|E
5|$|The EES's {{early work}} was {{conducted}} {{in the basement of}} the <b>Shop</b> <b>Building,</b> and Vaughan's office was in the Aeronautical Engineering Building. By 1938, the EES was producing useful technology, and the station needed a method to conduct contract work outside of the state budget. Consequently, the Industrial Development Council (IDC) was formed. It was created by the Chancellor of the University System and the president of Georgia Power Company, and the EES's director was a member of the council. The IDC later became the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, which currently serves as the sole contract organization for all Georgia Tech faculty and departments.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Georgia Institute of Technology {{can be traced back}} to Reconstruction-era plans to develop the {{industrial}} base of the Southern United States. Founded on October 13, 1885 in Atlanta as the Georgia School of Technology, the university opened in 1888 after the construction of Tech Tower and a <b>shop</b> <b>building</b> and only offered one degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, degrees in electrical, civil, textile, and chemical engineering were also offered. In 1948, the name was changed to the Georgia Institute of Technology to reflect its evolution from an engineering school to a full technical institute and research university.|$|E

5|$|The Human Resources and Research and Development {{buildings}} were originally constructed around 1912 by the MacKay Copper Process Company. The property was acquired in 1923 by the Thermos Company following the foreclosure of the MacKay company. The Human Resources building {{was used by}} the enameling department until its conversion in 1948. The Research and Development building was previously the Engineering building. A one-story hipped frame gatehouse was constructed in the 1920s. The Carpenter <b>Shop</b> (<b>Building</b> 62) was constructed in 1926. The Thermos factory completed construction of a storage building in 1929 (Building 2) and another storage building in 1941 (Building 1). Glass House 1 (Building 5) was constructed in 1939 and incorporates a warehouse dating from 1930 into its construction. Glass House 2 was constructed in 1951 and is connected to the Manufacturing Building by a conveyor.|$|E
5|$|This {{extremely}} long-tracked EF4 tornado {{touched down}} near Raleigh, Mississippi, in Smith County at 5:42p.m. CDT (2242 UTC), and {{continued into the}} Uniontown, Alabama area before dissipating. The tornado initially downed trees, blew skirting from mobile homes, and tore shingles from roofs. The tornado intensified as it moved northeast across Smith County and produced up to EF2 and EF3 damage. One mobile home was picked up, bounced a couple times, and thrown into a tree line, where it was torn apart and debris was scattered up to a mile away, including the frame. The tornado mowed down a stand of pine trees and destroyed two frame houses, with major damage to the interior walls, and the exterior walls completely destroyed. Many power poles were snapped, a mobile home was annihilated, and a large <b>shop</b> <b>building</b> was completely destroyed as well. It then moved into Jasper County and snapped and debarked many pine trees. The first area of EF4 damage was observed near Louin as a frame home and several mobile homes were completely destroyed, with parts of the mobile homes being thrown long distances, {{and some of the}} frame home foundation being swept clean. The tornado caused significant damage to a poultry farm and cattle ranch before it weakened briefly. It then destroyed two mobile homes and caused extensive tree and power line damage. The tornado then produced a relatively narrow path of EF1-strength tree and power line damage for several miles, until re-intensifying near to EF3 strength near Rose Hill.|$|E

25|$|At the {{northwest}} corner of the lot, there is a small wood-frame garage and <b>shop</b> <b>building.</b> The garage was built in 1940. It has a shed-roof with asphalt shingles that slopes from front to back. It has 6-inch horizontal clapboard siding and bay doors. There are two windows one {{on the north side of}} the building and one on the south side. The garage faces east and was originally connected to 12th Street by a gravel driveway. Today, the gravel lane has been replaced by a concrete driveway. Inside the garage there are two areas, a main space for storing a car and a small tool shop area.|$|E
25|$|Graceville Railway Station is {{situated}} between Chelmer and Sherwood stations on the Brisbane-Ipswich line, just over {{eight and a}} half kilometres on from Roma Street passenger station. It comprises two island platforms with dimpled concrete coping and six structures: a brick and concrete station building, four steel-framed platform awnings and a subway system accessed via ramps leading off both Honour Avenue and Appel Street. From Richlands Park in the north to Sherwood Road in the south, these two roadways run parallel to the generally north-west to south-east oriented rail corridor, which contains four tracks. The local terrain is flat, with the Brisbane River only about half a kilometre to the west and just over one kilometre distant to the east. The adjacent intersections are with Rakeevan Road and Verney Road West where there is a small shopping precinct, and Connors Street and Verney Road East, which is residential except for a timber <b>shop</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
25|$|On April 1, 1925 a fire {{destroyed}} {{the interior of}} the agricultural building and with it many research projects and an agricultural museum. The exterior of the building survived leading to the construction of Sikes Hall to hold the library from Tillman Hall. On May 27, 1926 Mechanical Hall was destroyed in a fire. Present-day Freeman Hall was built in 1926 was the reconstructed <b>shop</b> <b>building.</b> In 1928 Riggs Hall was established in honor of Walter Riggs. President Enoch Sikes increased student enrollment by over 1,000 students and expanded the degree programs with an addition of the first graduate degree. The Department of Arts and Sciences was formed in 1926 with the addition of modern languages programs. Programs at Clemson were reorganized into six schools of agriculture, chemistry, engineering, general science, textiles, and vocational studies. In 1927 Clemson received accreditation from the Association of Secondary Schools and Colleges of the Southern States.|$|E

500|$|Vaughan was {{selected}} as the Engineering Experiment Station's acting director in April 1934, and hired 13 part-time faculty and a few graduate assistants. The station's initial areas of focus were textiles, ceramics, and helicopter engineering. The early work of the station was conducted {{in the basement of the}} Old <b>Shop</b> <b>Building</b> next to Tech Tower, and Vaughan's office was in the Aeronautical Engineering Building. The station's name was technically the State Engineering Experiment Station, but it was generally referred to as the Engineering Experiment Station (EES) or simply [...] "the research station".|$|E
500|$|In 1887, {{the state}} of Georgia {{acquired}} [...] of land from Atlanta pioneer Richard Peters that would form the original campus of what was then called the Georgia School of Technology, {{as well as the}} site of its first two structures. The state hired the well-known architectural firm Bruce & Morgan to design an Academic Building, containing [...] "ample accommodations in halls, offices, apparatus rooms, recitation and lecture rooms, free hand and mechanical drawing rooms, library and chapel," [...] as well as a <b>Shop</b> <b>Building,</b> in which [...] "boiler and engine rooms, wood shop, machine shop, forge room and foundry" [...] were located.|$|E
500|$|Both {{buildings}} boasted {{towers and}} edifices of similar design. The complementary names and purposes of these buildings reflected the School's founding principles of valuing both theory and practice, while their similar appearance emphasized the equal standing of these principles. Construction work, contracted by Angus McGilvray with his low bid of US$43,250 ($ in [...] ), {{began with the}} Academic Building in June 1887; the building was completed in September 1888. The <b>Shop</b> <b>Building,</b> completed shortly afterward, was destroyed by fire in 1892 and rebuilt more modestly without a tower. Following this, the Academic Building, later known as Tech Tower, became the oldest building on the Georgia Tech campus, a distinction it continues to hold {{more than a century}} later.|$|E

500|$|Groves sent Kirkpatrick to {{supervise}} construction on Tinian by the Seabees of the 6th Naval Construction Brigade. Four air-conditioned Quonset huts {{of a type}} normally used for bombsight repair were provided for laboratory and instrument work. [...] There were five warehouses, a <b>shop</b> <b>building,</b> and assembly, ordnance and administrative buildings. Ramsey overcame {{the problem of how}} to ship through the San Francisco Port of Embarkation. The port wanted a detailed list of what was being sent so it could track it to ensure delivery, but what needed to be shipped was still subject to last-minute change. He simply designated everything as a [...] "bomb assembly kit". Three of these, one for Little Boy, one for Fat Man and one spare, were shipped to Tinian, which was now codenamed Destination O, commencing in May. Kirkpatrick arranged for everything to be shipped direct to Tinian rather than via Guam, as was usual.|$|E

The American flag and the Arkansas state flag affixed to the right and left sides of the shiny black engine gave a patriotic air to the event. Members of the Cotton Belt Railroad Historical Society invested over 35,000 man-hours into this restoration project. Jake Commer praised the efforts the Cotton Belt Route had extended stating, [...] "They helped us so much I can't even begin to tell you about all of it. If it hadn't been for the railroad, we couldn't have done it." ...|$|E
