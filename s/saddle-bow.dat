60|$|The prince {{leaped from}} his horse, leaving Pepper on the <b>saddle-bow.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{leaned over}} to me, and gripped my hand where it lay on the <b>saddle-bow</b> {{clutching}} the reins.|$|E
60|$|As McLeod spoke, he laid {{hold of a}} scalp {{which still}} dropped fresh blood as it hung at the hunter's <b>saddle-bow.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Australians, {{as is well}} known, {{insist on}} the merits of a [...] "swag," [...] or a long package formed by rolling all their {{possessions}} into their blanket. They carry it over the <b>saddle-bows.</b>|$|R
60|$|Each one of {{the party}} bowed to his <b>saddle-bows</b> as the tearing of {{branches}} was succeeded by a sound like the rushing of the winds, which {{was followed by a}} thundering report, and a shock that caused the very earth to tremble as {{one of the}} noblest ruins of the forest fell directly across their path.|$|R
60|$|The Parson's behests were obeyed. The hounds {{followed}} Mick {{into the}} plantation, and {{were followed by}} {{two or three of}} the more eager of the party, who did not object to receiving wet boughs in their faces, or who delighted in riding for half an hour with their heads bowed close down over their <b>saddle-bows.</b> The rest remained with the whipper, outside.|$|R
60|$|But Don Caesar {{had already}} dismounted, and tied his horse {{to a tree}} with a strong lariat that hung at his <b>saddle-bow.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Va-t-en donc, espece de type!" [...] {{said the}} girl on my <b>saddle-bow,</b> finding her tongue at last. Fear, or girlish modesty, had {{hitherto}} kept her silent.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would you}} saw the axe of King Richard," [...] {{answered}} the Western warrior, [...] "to which that which hangs at my <b>saddle-bow</b> weighs but as a feather." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{they had}} slept awhile, Godwin and Wulf rose and fed their horses. After they had washed and groomed them, they tested and did on their armour, then took {{them down to}} the spring to drink their fill, as their masters did. Also Wulf, who was cunning in war, brought with him four large wineskins which he had {{provided}} against this hour, and filling them with pure water, fastened two of them with thongs behind the saddle of Godwin and two behind his own. Further, he filled the water-bottles at their <b>saddle-bows,</b> saying: ...|$|R
60|$|Next, they {{secured the}} horses, which, being hobbled, {{as we have}} said elsewhere, were easily caught. Then the powder-horns and shot-belts of Bertram's party were found, and, being full of ammunition, were slung across their {{shoulders}} forthwith. Among other things belonging to the same party were discovered a number of blankets, some tea and sugar, {{and a variety of}} other useful articles, besides several packs of furs; all of which were made up into portable bundles that could be easily carried at their <b>saddle-bows.</b> The supply of everything was so ample that it was not necessary to touch a single article belonging to the Indians.|$|R
60|$|They had no sudden {{attack to}} fear from lurking foes, for an act of Edward the First was still in force, by which every highway leading from one market-town to another was always to be kept clear, for two hundred feet on each side, of every ditch, tree, or bush in which a man might lurk to do harm; while, as any ill that {{happened}} to travellers was made payable by the township in which it occurred, {{there was a strong}} personal interest {{on the part of the}} inhabitants to suppress plundering bands in their neighbourhood. Both Edgar and Albert rode in partial armour, with steel caps and breast-pieces, it being an ordinance that all of gentle blood when travelling should do so, and they carried swords by their sides, and light axes at their <b>saddle-bows.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{said the}} wounded man savagely; [...] "let me rest--see, I'm better now. You {{will find a}} flask in the bag at my <b>saddle-bow.</b> Bring it here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dost thou {{anticipate}} difficulty, friend?" [...] {{demanded the}} Italian, leaning forward on his <b>saddle-bow,</b> for his quick observation {{had caught the}} examining glance that the guide threw around at the heavens.|$|E
60|$|And with a {{dexterous}} {{sweep of}} his long whip, the worthy bishop entangled the jerboas long legs, whisked him up to his <b>saddle-bow,</b> and delivered him to the groom and the game-bag.|$|E
2500|$|Statements {{taken by}} Major Edward W. Wynkoop and his {{adjutant}} substantiated the later accounts of survivors. These statements were filed with his reports {{and can be}} found in the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, copies of which were submitted as evidence in the Joint Committee of the Conduct of the War and in separate hearings conducted by the military in Denver. Lieutenant James D. Cannon describes the mutilation of human genitalia by the soldiers, [...] "men, women, and children's privates cut out. I heard one man say that he had cut a woman's private parts out and had them for exhibition on a stick. I heard of one instance of a child, a few months old, being thrown into the feed-box of a wagon, and after being carried some distance, left on the ground to perish; I also heard of numerous instances in which men had cut out the private parts of females and stretched them over their <b>saddle-bows,</b> and some of them over their hats." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the opening}} of the last of these remarks there is much justice. So there is in the {{striking}} suggestion made in another place, that we should not bless erroneous systems for their utility, simply because they help to repair some small part of the mischief of which they have themselves been the principal cause.[61] But on the whole it is obvious that Condorcet was unfitted by his temper, and that of the school to which he most belonged, from accepting religion as a fact {{in the history of the}} human mind that must have some positive explanation. To look at it in this way as the creation of a handful of selfish impostors in each community, was to show a radical incompetence to carry out the scheme which had been so scientifically projected. The picture is ruined by the angry caricature of what ought to have been one of the most important figures in it. To this place the Christian Church is undeniably entitled, however we may be disposed to strike the balance between the undoubted injuries and the undoubted advantages which it has been the means of dealing to the civilisation of the west. Never perhaps was there so thorough an inversion of the true view of the comparative elevation of different parts of human character, as is implied in Condorcet's strange hint that Cromwell's satellites would have been much better men if they had carried instead of the Bible at their <b>saddle-bows</b> some merry book of the stamp of Voltaire's Pucelle.[62] ...|$|R
60|$|As the cavalcade passed {{beneath the}} arch of the great gate, the lively, spirit-stirring horn sounded a fare well air, to which custom had {{attached}} the signification of good wishes. It took the way towards {{the level of the}} Leman by means of a winding and picturesque bridle-path that led, among alpine meadows, groves, rocks, and hamlets, fairly to the water-side. Roger de Blonay and his two principal guests rode in front, the former seated on a war-horse that he had ridden years before as a soldier, and the two latter well mounted on beasts prepared for, and accustomed to, the mountains. Adelheid and Christine came next, riding by themselves, in the modest reserve of their maiden condition. Their discourse was low, confidential, and renewed at intervals. A few menials followed, and then came Sigismund {{at the side of the}} Signor Grimald's friend, and one of the family of Blonay, the latter of whom was destined to return with the baron, after doing honor to their guests by seeing them as far as Villeneuve The rear was brought up by muleteers, domestics, and those who led the beasts that bore the baggage. All of the former who intended to cross the Alps carried the fire-arms of the period at their <b>saddle-bows,</b> and each had his rapier, his couteau de chasse, or his weapon of more military fashion, so disposed about his person as to denote it was considered an arm for whose use some occasion might possibly occur.|$|R
6000|$|And once my arm {{was lifted}} to hew down, [...] A {{cavalier}} from off his <b>saddle-bow,</b> [...] That bore a lady from a leaguer'd town; [...] And then, I know not how, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our united purse," [...] pursued Ned, [...] "hung, {{as you are}} aware, at my <b>saddle-bow,</b> and yon unmitigated villain who {{appropriated}} my good steed, is now {{in possession}} of all our hard-earned gold!" ...|$|E
60|$|Because Gallio prided {{himself on}} his supreme {{disregard}} of human life--though he never extended the theory beyond his own--he naturally rode forty miles to the Mission with a tiny brown girl-baby on his <b>saddle-bow.</b>|$|E
6000|$|And {{indeed the}} zest of adventure, the zest to fight, never dormant, was glowing with {{compelling}} vigour now in those lazy {{eyes of his}} which were resting with such kindliness upon his stricken friend. [...] "Go home, Tony!" [...] he added, [...] "go, you rascal, and collect what things you want, while I send for Hastings and Ffoulkes, and see that four good horses are ready for us within the hour. To-night we sleep at Portishead, Tony. The Day-Dream is lying off there, ready to sail at any {{hour of the day}} or night. The Hollandia has twenty-four hour's start of us, alas! and we cannot overtake her now: but we'll be in Nantes ere those devils can do much mischief: and once in Nantes!... Why, Tony man! think of the glorious escapes we've had together, you and I! Think of the gay, mad rides across the north of France, with half-fainting women and swooning children across our <b>saddle-bows!</b> Think of the day when we smuggled the de Tournais out of Calais harbour, the day we snatched Juliette Déroulède and her Paul out of the tumbril and tore across Paris with that howling mob at our heels! Think! think, Tony! of all the happiest, merriest moments of your life and they will seem dull and lifeless beside what is in store for you, when with your dear wife's arms clinging round your neck, we'll fly along the quays of Nantes on the road to liberty! Ah, Tony lad! {{were it not for the}} anxiety which I know is gnawing at your heart, I would count this one of the happiest hours of my happy life!" ...|$|R
60|$|If, as Viollet-le-Duc {{tells us}} to believe, a {{building}} reflects the character of its inhabitants, it must be impossible for one reared in an Eastern palace to think straightly or speak freely or--but here the annals of Rajputana contradict the theory--to act openly. The cramped and darkened rooms, the narrow smooth-walled passages with recesses where a man might wait for his enemy unseen, the maze of ascending and descending stairs leading nowhither, the ever-present screens of marble tracery that may hide or reveal so much,--all these things breathe of plot and counter-plot, league and intrigue. In a living palace where the sightseer knows and feels that there are human beings everywhere, {{and that he is}} followed by scores of unseen eyes, the impression is almost unendurable. In a dead palace--a cemetery of loves and hatreds done with hundreds of years ago, and of plottings that had for their end, though the greybeards who plotted knew it not, the coming of the British tourist with guide-book and sun-hat--oppression gives place to simply impertinent curiosity. The Englishman wandered into all parts of the palace, for {{there was no one to}} stop him--not even the ghosts of the dead Queens--through ivory-studded doors, into the women's quarters, where a stream of water once flowed over a chiselled marble channel. A creeper had set its hands upon the lattice there, and there was dust of old nests in one of the niches in the wall. Did the lady of light virtue who managed to become possessed of so great a portion of Jey Singh's library ever set her dainty feet in the trim garden of the Hall of Pleasure beyond the screen-work? Was it in the forty-pillared Hall of Audience that the order went forth that the Chief of Birjooghar was to be slain, and from what wall did the King look out when the horsemen clattered up the steep stone path to the palace, bearing on their <b>saddle-bows</b> the heads of the bravest of Rajore? There were questions innumerable to be asked in each court and keep and cell; but the only answer was the cooing of the pigeons.|$|R
60|$|While the maidens of Ruth were {{preparing}} a repast {{suited to the}} hour and {{to the quality of}} the guests, Mark and his son had abundant opportunity to examine the appearance of the strangers. They were men who seemed to wear visages peculiarly adapted to the characters of their entertainers being in truth so singularly demure and grave in aspect, as to excite some suspicion of their being newly-converted zealots to the mortifying customs of the Colony. Notwithstanding their extraordinary gravity, and contrary to the usages of those regions, too, they bore about their persons certain evidence of being used to the fashions of the other hemisphere. The pistols attached to their <b>saddle-bows,</b> and other accoutrements of a warlike aspect, would perhaps have attracted no observation, had they not been accompanied by a fashion in the doublet, the hat, and the boot, that denoted a greater intercourse with the mother country, than was usual among the less sophisticated natives of those regions. None traversed the forests without the means of defence but, on the other hand, few wore the hostile implements with so much of a worldly air, or with so many minor particularities of some recent caprice in fashion. As they had however announced themselves to be officers of the King, they, who of necessity must be chiefly concerned in the object of their visit, patiently awaited the pleasure of the strangers, to learn why duty had called them so far from all the more ordinary haunts of men: for, like the native owners of the soil, the self-restrained religionists appeared to reckon an indiscreet haste in any thing, among the more unmanly weaknesses. Nothing for the first half-hour of their visit escaped the guarded lips of men evidently well skilled in their present duty, which might lead to a clue of its purport. The morning meal passed almost without discourse, and one of the party had arisen with the professed object of looking to their steeds, before he, who seemed the chief, led the conversation to a subject, that by its political bearing might, in some degree, be supposed to have a remote connexion with the principal object of his journey to that sequestered valley.|$|R
60|$|One of Dick's men {{carried a}} flask of some strong cordial, {{and with this}} Dick succeeded in {{reviving}} consciousness. Then he took Joanna's friend upon his <b>saddle-bow,</b> and once more pushed toward the forest.|$|E
6000|$|... "King James {{and all his}} nobles went... Ever the King was bending low [...] To {{his white}} jennet's <b>saddle-bow,</b> [...] Doffing his cap to burgher dame, [...] Who smiling blushed for pride and shame." ...|$|E
6000|$|SECOND ALDERMAN. I {{hear that}} Gardiner, coming with the Queen, And meeting Pembroke, bent to his <b>saddle-bow,</b> As if {{to win the}} man by {{flattering}} him. Is he so safe to fight upon her side? ...|$|E
60|$|After {{that came}} a long ride through that silent night upon the <b>saddle-bow</b> {{in front of}} Diccon Bowman; then a deep, heavy sleep, that fell upon him {{in spite of the}} {{galloping}} of the horses.|$|E
60|$|He {{held up a}} heavy leathern bag. The knight, who {{had come}} prepared, took down another such bag from his <b>saddle-bow.</b> Down went one silver piece from the knight. Down went another from the beggar.|$|E
60|$|The {{nurse was}} slain by a blow with a battle-axe, and Margaret, {{snatched}} from her palfrey, was thrown across the <b>saddle-bow</b> {{of one of}} the mounted men, who then with his comrades dashed off at full speed.|$|E
60|$|They {{settled down}} to listen, Sir Richard bare-headed to the sunshine, dandling the sword in both hands, while the grey horse cropped outside the Ring, and the helmet on the <b>saddle-bow</b> clinged softly each time he jerked his head.|$|E
6000|$|... 'At last,' he went on, 'after {{a year of}} striving and contriving {{and some}} little driving, De Aquila came to the valley, alone and without warning. I saw him first at the Lower Ford, with a swineherd's brat on his <b>saddle-bow.</b>|$|E
60|$|It took Katie {{some time}} to {{convince}} him that, just because he had the licence in his pocket, he could not snatch her up on his <b>saddle-bow</b> and carry her off to the nearest clergyman after the manner of young Lochinvar.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Queen {{sends the}} white {{stallion}} as a farewell gift to her Lord Incubu, and bids me tell my lord {{that he is}} the fleetest and most enduring horse in all the land,' said the soldier, bending to his <b>saddle-bow</b> before us.|$|E
60|$|So Sir Bleoberis untied the goblet {{from where}} it hung at his <b>saddle-bow,</b> and Sir Tristram took the goblet and gave him gramercy for it; and therewith having {{recovered}} their horses, each knight mounted, and betook his way whither he was going.|$|E
60|$|Bobby {{remembered how}} pale and haggard {{he had looked}} and how his hand had by the merest {{instinct}} clutched at the <b>saddle-bow,</b> and then had dropped away from it--helpless and inert. Now he lay quite still with his head resting against Bobby's shoulder.|$|E
