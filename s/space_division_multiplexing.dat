40|$|The {{parallel}} use {{of multiple}} channels in a WDM star network means that too many packets may simultaneously arrive for the same destination station, necessitating {{the implementation of a}} destination-conflict-resolution function somewhere within the network. This thesis considers explicitly, the placement of the destination-conflict-resolution function which specifies the location(s) where it should be performed, and when it should be performed. Traditional placements in which the function is located at all user stations and performed either before packet transmission (using the request-schedule-then-transmit principle) or after a destination conflict has been detected (using the detect-and-retransmit-if-lost principle), is compared with a central placement in which only one central station located {{at the entrance to the}} star coupler is responsible for detecting conflicts and re-scheduling the arrival times of “otherwise lost” packets whilst they are en route to their destinations, so that they arrive when their destinations free to receive them. The networks are evaluated considering their delay and throughput characteristics, the computational complexity of their protocols, and their hardware demands. All numerical results were produced using AKAROA an object-oriented parallel simulation package developed by us for automated precision control of steady-state estimates and automated parallel execution of quantitative simulations. The results presented suggests that significant performance improvements are achievable with the central placement since destination conflicts are resolved without having to retransmit packets nor waiting until the end of a request-broadcast-and-schedule phase before a given packet can be transmitted. The central station works with <b>Space</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Multiplexed</b> signals, just before they enter the star coupler. Its implementation is therefore simpler than when all stations are charged with this task, each of which has to attend to multiple WDM channels.

40|$|We revisit a {{recently}} proposed framework for "massive MIMO" named Joint <b>Space</b> <b>Division</b> and <b>Multiplexing</b> (JSDM), that explicitly distinguishes between long-term channel statistics and instantaneous channel state information. In JSDM, the beamforming function is {{split into two}} components: prebeamforming and multiuser precoding. The pre-beamforming stage depends only on the channel covariance information, which is (locally) time-invariant and can be acquired without significant training overhead by averaging over time. Based on this information, the pre-beamforming stage separates the users into groups without significant mutual interference, irrespectively of their instantaneous random channel realization. Then, inside each user group, a standard multiuser MIMO precoding scheme based on instantaneous channel state information {{can be used in}} order to achieve further multiuser multiplexing gain. JSDM is naturally suited to a Hybrid Digital Analog (HDA) implementation, where the pre-beamforming function can be accomplished through a reconfigurable RF front-end.
