50|$|The Marine Corps has {{the most}} stable and most {{recognizable}} uniforms in the American military; the Blue Dress {{dates back to the}} early 19th century and the service uniform to the early 20th century. Marines' uniforms are distinct in their simplicity; Marines do not wear unit patches or United States flags on any of their uniforms, nor name tags on their service and formal uniforms. Only a handful of skills (parachutist, air crew, explosive ordnance disposal, etc.) warrant distinguishing badges, and rank insignia is not worn on uniform headgear (with the exception of an officer's garrison <b>service</b> <b>cover).</b> While other servicemembers commonly identify with a sub-group as much as or more than their service (Ranger, submariner, aircrew, etc.), Marine uniforms do not reflect such division.|$|E

5000|$|Eastwood {{continued}} {{to expand his}} repertoire by playing opposite Meryl Streep in the love story The Bridges of Madison County (1995). Based on a best-selling novel by Robert James Waller, it relates the story of Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), a photographer working for National Geographic, who has {{a love affair with}} a middle-aged Italian farm wife in Iowa named Francesca (Streep). Eastwood and Streep got along famously during production and such was their on-screen chemistry that a number of people believed that the two were having an affair off-camera, although this was denied by both. The film was a hit at the box office and grossed $71 million in North America. The film, unlike the novel, surprised film critics and was warmly received. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that Clint had managed to create [...] "a moving, elegiac love story at the heart of Mr. Wallers self-congratulatory overkill", while Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal described The Bridges of Madison County as [...] "one of the most pleasurable films in recent memory". Eastwood then directed and starred in the well-received political thriller Absolute Power. The films ensemble cast featured Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, Laura Linney, Scott Glenn, Dennis Haysbert, Judy Davis, and E. G. Marshall. Eastwood played a veteran thief who witnesses the Secret <b>Service</b> <b>cover</b> up a murder the President was responsible for.|$|E
