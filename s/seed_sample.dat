A total of 188 <b>seed</b> <b>samples</b> from various locations, {{collected}} in 1989 (42) and 2002 (146), were tested, using the blotter, dry inspection and washing methods.

Six essential oils of plants were investigated for their inhibitory activity against eight pathogenic fungi. Thirty four and 27 fungal species were found in <b>seed</b> <b>samples</b> of sorghum and pearl millet, respectively. Phoma sp. and Fusarium moniliforme infected 95 to 100 % of the <b>seed</b> <b>samples</b> of both sorghum and pearl millet. Sphacelotheca sorghi and Tolyposporium ehrenbergii were encountered in respectively, 75 and 33 % of <b>seed</b> <b>samples</b> of sorghum. T. penicillariae, Sclerospora graminicola and Claviceps fusiformis were present in 88, 41 and 32 % of <b>seed</b> <b>samples</b> of pearl millet, respectively. Seeds inoculated with Acremonium strictum, Curvularia oryzae, F. equiseti, F. moniliforme and F. subglutinans and sown in sterilized soil, showed considerable mortality of the seedlings. Three essential oils inhibited in vitro the mycelial growth of all the fungi used by 85 to 100 % and reduced significantly sorghum and pearl millet seed infection rates of Phoma sp., Fusarium sp., Curvularia sp., Colletotrichum graminicola and Exserohilum sp. Presence of many pathogenic fungi in considerable number of <b>seed</b> <b>samples</b> indicates the need of field surveys for these and other pathogens.
