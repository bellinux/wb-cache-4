Carry over was initially detected in the <b>solvent</b> <b>blank</b> after each sample injection. For this reason, FI/MS experiments were performed by adding an equilibrium step of 2 min between injections to allow the residual m/z values to be purged from the LC system completely.

40|$|The {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) column is capable of enrichment/pre-concentration of trace impurities in the mobile phase during the column equilibration, prior to sample injection and elution. These impurities elute during gradient elution and result in significant chromatographic peaks. Three types of purified water were tested for their impurity levels, and hence their performances as mobile phase, in HPLC followed by total ion current (TIC) mode of MS. Two types of HPLC-grade water produced 3 - 4 significant peaks in <b>solvent</b> <b>blanks</b> while LC/MS-grade water produced no peaks (although peaks were produced by LC/MS-grade water also {{after a few days}} of standing). None of the three waters produced peaks in HPLC followed by UV-Vis detection. These peaks, if co-eluted with analyte, are capable of suppressing or enhancing the analyte signal in a MS detector. As it is not common practice to run <b>solvent</b> <b>blanks</b> in TIC mode, when quantification is commonly carried out using single ion monitoring (SIM) or single or multiple reaction monitoring (SRM or MRM), the effect of co-eluting impurities on the analyte signal and hence on the accuracy of the results is often unknown to the analyst. Running <b>solvent</b> <b>blanks</b> in TIC mode, regardless of the MS mode used for quantification, is essential in order to detect this problem and to take subsequent precautions.

40|$|The {{application}} of infrared spectroscopy to biological samples {{has been made}} possible largely by the advent of FTIR. The advances in instrumentation which have allowed this application are well documented, however, {{there are still some}} barriers to the full utilization of this technique for biological samples such as proteins. The general objectives are to obtain spectra in the 1700 - 1600 cm - 1 region, where the Amide I band is located. This broad, generally featureless, band is a complex composite of bands which are characteristic of specific types of secondary structure in the protein 1. The problems to be overcome fall into several categories. The need to work in aqueous solutions, where water has a very large absorption band at 1650 cm 4, has been circumvented to a large extent by working in D 20, although it is still necessary to employ short path length cells, as the absorbance of the H-O-D overlaps both the Amide I and Amide II regions. In spite of the similarity of D 20 and H 2 O, there are still advantages to obtaining spectra in both solvents as in D 20 the accessible N-H groups in the peptide bonds will undergo H->D exchange. A comparison between spectra obtained in the two solvents will therefore give information on solvent accessibility of the peptide bonds in the different types of secondary structure and will also assist in assigning bands to particular secondary structures. Coupled with this requirement of short path length cells is the tendency of proteins to denature on surfaces. This requires that demountable cells be used and these cells, especially with 6 - 50 3 ̆bcm spacers, have a variability in path length from sample to sample, and especially from sample to the <b>solvent</b> <b>blank</b> which makes subtraction of the <b>solvent</b> <b>blank</b> very difficult. This problem of solvent subtraction is most acute when H 2 O is the solvent as here the high solvent absorbance is coupled with the smaller, and more variable, path length. Once the sample spectrum minus the solvent has been obtained the broad Amide I band has to be subjected to some type of enhancement procedure, usually Fourier self-deconvolution 2, in order to resolve the bands due to particular types of protein secondary structure. Both the solvent subtraction and the deconvolution are somewhat subjective and open to criticism. In this report we demonstrate that reproducible deconvolved spectra can be obtained in both D 20 and H 2 O. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

30|$|While {{the models}} {{obtained}} for both (C) and (G) appeared well trained and validated, {{we found that}} it was necessary to introduce some noise into the respective models to assess if the models were sensitive to statistical outlier due to repeat analyses using MS, as judged basing on the RMSE values. The inclusion of this additional step was to address concerns associated with possible m/z signal confusion (with instrumental artifacts) discussed by Enot and colleagues for experiments involving no chromatographic step. To achieve the objective of enhanced noise to signal data separation, spectra of <b>solvent</b> <b>blanks</b> (representing noise) comprising 50 : 50 (v/v) mobile phases of 0.1 % formic acid (A) and MeOH (B) were entered into the ANN models, where the process of model training and cross validation was reiterated by utilizing the same K-fold condition and three hidden nodes. As expected, the RMSE and r 2 values for both (C) and (G) basing on the results obtained by applying the individual cross validated model changed from < 4 % to > 10 %, and from 0.9990 to 0.8900, respectively. The increase in RMSE values and reduction in r 2 values suggested that the cross validated models for (C) and (G), when fully optimized, were sufficiently robust in identifying noise in the data. The high sensitivity of the RMSE and r 2 values with respect to noise in the data highlighted the need to perform an additional data pre-processing step prior to performing statistical analyses. Indeed, our observation is in good agreement with protocols reported by other researchers (Enot et al [2006]; Broadhurst and Kell [2006]). One possible solution to achieve data integrity would be to consider applying t-test as a data pre-processing step. In this study, however, no data cleanup was performed, thereby suggesting that the LIT was robust as a tool when applied to perform repeat analyses.|$|R

The glassware’s were then removed from the oven and allowed to cool down and stored in dust-free cabinets. Deionized water was used throughout the study. For the spectrophotometric analysis, reagent blank determinations were used to correct the instrument readings. For validation of the analytical procedure, repeated analysis of the samples against internationally certified/standard reference material (SRM- 1570) of National Institute of Standard and Technology were used.

The ubiquity of DiBP by a non-constant leaching process in the laboratory was detected, which could not guarantee the achievement of a trustworthy quantification. To handle this, {{the assessment of the}} level of DiBP in <b>solvent</b> <b>blanks</b> having fixed the probabilities of false non-compliance (α) and false compliance (β) at 0. 01 was performed. On the other hand, another special case was that of DiNP, in whose chromatogram finger peaks appear because of an array of possible C 9 isomers. PARAFAC, used for the identification and quantification of all the substances, is a useful chemometric tool that enabled a more reliable determination of this analyte since no peak areas were considered but chromatographic and spectral loadings. Since phthalates may migrate from rubber latex items, an evaluation of the existence of matrix effects on the determination of the five analytes was conducted prior to an extraction with hexane from a dummy for infants. As matrix effects were present, the quantification of the compounds under study was performed following the standard addition method using PARAFAC sample loadings as response variable. As a result, the presence of BHT was confirmed, being its concentration equal to 37. 87 μg L− 1.

40|$|A fast {{automated}} extraction and {{clean-up procedure}} for low-level analysis of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (cPCBs) in biological fluids is presented. Online extraction of prepared fluids {{is carried out}} using disposable octadecyl bonded (C- 18) solid-phase extraction columns. Extracts are then cleaned up through disposable multi-layer silica (acidic, basic and neutral) and dispersed PX- 21 carbon columns. This new methodology is compared with classical Soxhlet extraction and manual solid-phase extraction in terms of repeatability, reproducibility, accuracy and recovery rates for reference and certified materials. Robustness is evaluated on different matrices, such as cow's milk, breast milk and human serum. As {{a consequence of the}} reduced number of reusable glassware used, as well as lowering of <b>solvent</b> consumption, recorded <b>blank</b> levels are decreased in favor of limits of detection (LODs). Total analysis time and cost are further reduced using simultaneous sample preparation units and the sample throughput is increased compared to classical methods. As a result, this new approach appears to be suitable for the fast sample preparation often required for such fluids in case of emergency foodstuffs analysis or during large epidemiological studies.

40|$|The {{detection}} of predators by prey species {{is crucial in}} order to escape {{the threat posed by}} a predator. In mammals, the olfactory sensory system is commonly used to detect odors emitted by predators, and to determine how threatening the situation actually is. However, knowledge about this ability is still sparse and in some cases conflicting. The aim {{of the present study was}} therefore to assess whether CD- 1 mice (Mus musculus) show behaviors such as avoidance, anxiety and/or decreased activity when exposed to any of the three odorants: cat bladder urine, horse voided urine or a fruity odor (N-pentyl acetate), with a <b>blank</b> <b>solvent</b> as an alternative in a two-compartment test arena. I found no significant differences between avoidance (the time that the mice spent in the different compartments), anxiety (the numbers of fecal pellets dropped by the mice), or the overall activity (the number of switches between the two compartments), when the mice were exposed to the three different odors. The fact that the cat urine derived from the bladder of the cat may explain the lack of avoidance responses, since bladder urine might not contain the same chemical components as voided urine. Bladder urine might therefore also lack the chemical components that signal “predator” to the mice. In conclusion, mice do not respond differently to the odor of cat bladder urine than to horse voided urine or to the fruity odor of N-pentyl acetate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Studying {{the toxic}} risk of {{pesticide}} exposure to ladybird beetles is important from an agronomical and eco-logical perspective since larval and adult ladybirds are domi-nant predators of herbivorous pest insects (e. g., aphids) in various crops in China. This article mainly {{deals with the}} long-term effects of a single application of the insect growth regulator hexaflumuron on Coccinella septempunctata. A 72 -h and a 33 -day toxicity test with hexaflumuron (single appli-cation) were performed, starting with the second instar larvae of C. septempunctata. Exposure doses in the long-term exper-iment were based on the estimated 72 -h acute LR 50 (applica-tion rate causing 50 % mortality) value of 304 g active ingredient (a. i.) ha− 1 for second instar larvae of C. septempunctata. The long-term test used five hexaflumuron doses as treatment levels (1 / 50, 1 / 100, 1 / 200, 1 / 400, and 1 / 800 of the 72 -h acute LR 50), as well as a <b>solvent</b> control and <b>blank</b> control treatment. Themeasurement endpoints used to calculate no observed effect application rates (NOERs) included devel-opment time, hatching, pupation, adult emergence, survival, and number of eggs produced. Analyzing the experimental data with one-way analysis of variance showed that the single hexaflumuron application had significant effects on C. septempunctata endpoints in the 33 -day test, including effects on development duration (NOER 1. 52 g a. i. ha− 1), hatching (NOER 3. 04 g a. i. ha− 1), pupation (NOER 3. 04 g a. i. ha− 1), and survival (NOER 1. 52 g a. i. ha− 1). These NOERs are lower than the reported maximum field application rate of hexaflumuron (135 g a. i. ha− 1) in cotton cultivation, suggesting potential risks to beneficial arthropods...|$|R
40|$|Background-•Malaria is an {{important}} tropical disease which claims millions of lives in Africa The mortalityratc is estimated tobe over 600000 people per year and this has risen in recent year due to increasing resistance of P. falciparumto ant malarial medicines Malaria control recruits; integrated approach, including prevention(primarily vector control) and prompt treatment effective ant malarial drugs. Although the control measures have to certain extent successful emergency of resistant strains which refuse to respond to currently used ant malarial age; frustrates the effort to eradicate malaria. This has therefore reinvigorated the interest to search new ant malarial agents from natural sources including medicinal plants. Thus, this stud; evaluatedantimalarialactivity of the extracts of Lantana camara (Verbanaceae) flowers, which are ethnomedically used {{in the treatment of}} malaria in the Lake Victoria zone, Tanzania. Objective: This study aims at investigating the in vivo ant malarial activity of Lantana camara flowerextractsin albino mice. Methods: Lantana camera flowers were collectedin Sengerema Mwanza, air dried under shade and then grounded to get powders, and after that the powdered plant materials were extracted by using maceration extraction processes. Then the obtained extracts were tested in vivofor ant malarial activity using Theiler’s albino mice. The extractswere administered to mice orally, four consecutive days for suppressive test after having infected the mice with 2 xlUl (0. 2 ml per mouse) of parasites intravenous. The administrations of extracts started on the day the parasite were inoculated. The extracts were given at the dose of 500 mg/kg hwt, and the control group they were given <b>blank</b> <b>solvent.</b> On day 4 after infection, thin smears of blood films were obtained from the peripheral blood on the tail of each mouse and then parasitemia was determined. Results: Dichloromethane, Ethanol, and Ethyl acetate extracts from Lantana camara flowers were observed to suppress plasmodium berghei parasitaemia in the albino mice by 48. 82 %, 31. 49 %. 53. 27 %, respectively. Conclusion: Ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and ethanolic extracts of Lantana camara L flowers have shown good in vivo ant malarial activity in rodent malaria model. Thus, further studies are needed to evaluate the observed ant malarial activity using human malaria parasites- (P. falciparum) and identifychemical constituents which may be responsible for the observed anti malarial activity...|$|R
30|$|For {{the sample}} {{characterization}} {{according to its}} degree of esterification and amount of pigments, we used the AOAC official method 970.64 with the modifications introduced by Fletcher (2006). The difference with the original method is that the saponification step is omitted and larger volumes of elution solvents are used; also, the final dilution is greater than in the original method. With this method {{we were able to}} separate the fractions, those which had their xanthophylls quantified and those which had their degree of esterification measured. Thus, the pigments were classified as di-esters (E), monohydroxy pigments (MHP), free pigments or dihydroxy pigments (DHP), and residual pigments or polyols (RP). The content of xanthophylls was expressed as equivalents of trans-luteins. To extract the pigments, we dissolved 50  mg of oleoresin and 5  mL of the culture broth sample in 30  mL of HEAT using a 100  mL volumetric flask, adding 2  mL of methanol. After stirring, we left this mix in the dark for 1  h before conducting any analysis. Subsequently, the pigments were separated by open column chromatography. The column was 12.5  mm i.d. X 30  cm, with Teflon stopcock; the column was 2  mm i.d. and 10  cm long. The stationary phase comprised a mixture of silica gel–diatomaceous earth (1 / 1, w/w) activated by drying. The activation was carried out by heating in an oven for 24  h at 90  °C. The mixture was then cooled and stored in a desiccator before use. The column was packed with 7  cm of stationary phase and 2  cm of anhydrous sodium sulfate. After the column was packed and connected to a Buchner flask, an aspirator was connected to one of the ends of the flask to initiate the separation; the amount of sample of the extraction solution was 5  mL. We used four eluents: for carotenes and esters, hexane/acetone (96 / 4, v/v); for MHP, hexane/acetone (90 / 10, v/v); for DHP, hexane/acetone (80 / 20, v/v); for RP, hexane/methanol/acetone (80 / 10 / 10, v/v/v). The eluents were added in the same order until the corresponding fraction was recovered, which was then immediately transferred to the next solvent. Once the desired fraction was obtained, it was diluted with a known volume (25, 50 or 100  mL) of water, and its absorbance was read at 474  nm using the elution <b>solvent</b> as the <b>blank.</b> After determining the amount of pigments in each band or fraction, we calculated their percentage share of the total. In order to obtain ester-free lutein, we saponified a known amount of oleoresin, followed by open column chromatography in which the third band (corresponding to the DHP) was recovered. Lutein was identified by its spectral properties and its chromatographic behavior. No other tests were carried out because we were working with marigold oleoresin, in which lutein represents about 80 % of the pigment content.|$|R
40|$|Risk {{assessment}} for air pollutants remains a complex task. In this project, we aimed to assess air pollutant risk through {{the combination of}} active air sampling, bioanalytical assessment and selective chemical analysis. To achieve this air samples were collected over several weeks from both indoor and outdoor sites and subjected {{to a range of}} bioanalytical assays. Both XAD (gas phase) and filter paper (particles) samples were tested for responses in genotoxicity, Ah-receptor response, estrogenicity and respiratory toxicity assays. The method of sampling, sample extraction and processing principally targeted semivolatile organic chemicals. Phase 1 of the study concerned the set-up of assays, evaluation of blanks and the validation of responses to known chemicals of concerns. Five endpoints were included in the evaluation including non-specific cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, Ah-receptor response, estrogenicity and respiratory immunotoxicity. Dose response assessments for test chemicals were carried out with all assays and standard operating procedures for the testing have been developed. Blank toxicity evaluation found that sampling matrices and the preparation of these requires some attention and it is important to use ultrapure solvent for the preparation of the sampling matrices. Phases 2 and 3 of the project focussed on the testing of actual samples collected at different sites in Queensland and Western Australia. During phase 2, the first evaluation of air samples showed that the assays could detect differences between different sites and in both the gas and particle phase. For example using extracts of filter papers collected from the indoor domestic site a genotoxic and estrogenic response was detectable whereas the extracts of the XAD fraction from the same site registered an effect in the respiratory assay. In the sample collected outdoors at the same location genotoxic and estrogenic responses in the XAD fraction were quantifiable. Phase 3 of the project tested samples collected at a wider range of sites in winter 2007. These sites included an indoor industrial location, two offices, two sites near major roadways, a residential area, light industry and a background site. Selected samples were also subjected to an aqueous extraction for examination of any ionic/water-soluble chemicals present. Results showed that overall, air samples produced a more genotoxic response in terms of direct acting chemicals (-S 9) at both indoor and outdoor sites. In most cases the gas phase fraction of these samples was more toxic than the particle phase. The gas and particles phases of the samples collected at the indoor industrial site and a high traffic site were the most toxic. Interestingly the gas phase from the two office sites and the samples collected at the polluted sites produced similar genotoxic responses. Air samples collected at most sites also produced genotoxic responses for chemicals that required metabolic activation to damage DNA (+S 9). However, in general, toxicity due to these chemicals was lower than that associated with direct acting chemicals. The genotoxic effect of chemicals requiring metabolic activation was detected in both the gas and particle phase of samples. The gas phase samples collected at the offices and at a high traffic site recorded the highest toxicity. However genotoxic effects were also detected in filter papers collected from three outdoor sites. These sites were all located near roadways. These results suggest that even though industrial and vehicular related National Research Centre for Environmental Toxicology Page 3 of 49 activities are associated with the release of genotoxic pollutants, there were also unidentified sources of such chemicals at the office sites. Air samples collected from all sites elicited an Ah receptor response in the CAFLUX bioassay. Results (expressed as TCDD equivalent air concentrations) showed that in contrast to genotoxicity assessed on the umu assay, the Ah-receptor activity was primarily associated with the particle phase of samples. Surprisingly, the sample collected at the high density residential site exceeded equivalent concentrations measured in samples collected at both high traffic sites. Further testing of two samples indicated that the response on CAFLUX was possibly due to chemicals other than dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. All air samples showed a response in the E-screen bioassays for estrogenicity. Results were expressed as estradiol equivalency adjusted for air volume sampled. In all cases the gas phase of air samples was more estrogenic than the particle phase, usually by a factor 2 or more. The gas phase samples collected from indoors exhibited the highest estrogenicity of all samples. Both water and solvent extracts were tested on the respiratory toxicity assay. Water extracts of filter papers from both high traffic sites were significantly different from one of two field <b>blanks.</b> <b>Solvent</b> extracted samples were not significantly different from the corresponding field blanks. Further work is required to determine why certain samples, including the second field blank, tested as cytotoxic. This study demonstrates that we are exposed {{to a wide variety of}} chemical pollutants that have a range of potential health effects. This work has also identified that the gas phase is potentially an important pathway for exposure, particularly for genotoxic effects. Chemicals inhaled via the gas phase are more efficiently transported into the lung and adsorbed by tissue. Traditionally, investigations into the health risk associated with semivolatile organic pollutants in air have not separated the gas and particle phases. A comparison between the umu assay based benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) equivalencies and equivalences determined using chemical analysis showed that in the particle phase only 10 % of chemicals and in the gas phase, less than 1 % of chemicals responsible for the observed effect have been identified. Further work is required to identify the other chemicals that are contributing to the genotoxic response in samples. In contrast, CAFLUX results showed a significant correlation with the PAH analysis, suggesting the dominant component of the samples causing this response were PAHs. This area of research is rapidly producing useful techniques to expand the toolbox available for characterising air quality. Importantly this report shows that the results from such bioanalytical tests could be communicated in terms that were meaningful for air quality managers by using specific chemical equivalencies for comparison to guideline values. This approach has the added advantage of accounting for significantly more of the chemical constituents in a sample. As the comparison to PAH results showed, the traditional approach to air quality management which targets specific chemicals could underestimate the potential risk of exposure at certain sites including indoor locations where humans spend a significant amount of time...|$|R
