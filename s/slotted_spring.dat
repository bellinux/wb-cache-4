40|$|A load–displacement {{prediction}} for a bended {{slotted disc}} using the energy method Noor Fawazi 1, 2, Jung-Youn Lee 3 and Jae-Eung Oh 4 A <b>slotted</b> disc <b>spring</b> {{consists of two}} segments: a coned disc segment {{and a number of}} lever arm segments. In this study, a load–displacement formula for the <b>slotted</b> disc <b>spring</b> is newly developed in the form of energy method by considering both rigid and bending deflections of the two segments. This formula is developed with the aim to further improve the SAE formula which is limited to a straight <b>slotted</b> disc <b>spring.</b> The coned and the lever arm angles of the straight <b>slotted</b> disc <b>spring</b> are the same. They are different for a bended <b>slotted</b> disc <b>spring.</b> Because of this limitation, it is geometrically impractical to employ the SAE formula for a bended <b>slotted</b> disc <b>spring.</b> To achieve the goal of this study, new calculations based on geometric and material properties inputs are developed for a bended <b>slotted</b> disc <b>spring.</b> A firm background study based on the theory of Almen is presented in developing new load–displacement calculations for a bended <b>slotted</b> disc <b>spring...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{calculation of}} the load-displacement prediction for a <b>slotted</b> disc <b>spring</b> is proposed. There {{are two types of}} slotted disc spring; a straight <b>slotted</b> disc <b>spring</b> and a bended <b>slotted</b> disc <b>spring.</b> By considering these two types of <b>slotted</b> disc <b>spring,</b> this work attempts to extend the previous work on load-displacement prediction for the <b>slotted</b> disc <b>spring</b> using the energy method. To show the validity of the improved method, the load-displacement results using the improved computation, the previous proposed method, and the finite element analyses are compared. In this work, the improved computation and the finite element analyses have accounted for the radial deflection of the disc spring which is different in the previous work. The radial deflection of the disc spring was ignored in the previous work and the comparison to the finite element analyses without accounting the radial deflection is not practical. The present work is compared to the finite element analyses which make the comparison to be more reasonable and more practical...|$|R

40|$|Titanium nickelide (nitinol) {{is one of}} {{prospective}} materials for production of special endo-prostheses and other parts and characterized with effect of shape memory. A specific feature of vascular endo-prostheses is the necessity to provide the required rigidity within the temperature interval from 15 to 42 оС. It has been established that titanium nickelide is able to provide the required rigidity but it depends on preliminary heat treatment parameters. So, {{it is important to}} determine rela-tions between rigidity of titanium nickelide wire and its preliminary heat treatment parameters for the given temperature in-terval. The aim of the work is to create devices that allow to estimate radial and flexural rigidity of elements made of flexible nitinol wire for manufacturing various medical products, including endo-prostheses of vessels – stents and stent grafts, filter traps. Laboratory digital scales and a specially developed dynamometer based on a cylindrical <b>slotted</b> <b>spring</b> and inductive displacement transducer have been used for measuring a load. The paper proposes possible variants of device designs used to monitor radial rigidity of blood vessel endo-prostheses, as well as to control flexural rigidity of endo-prosthesis elements and wire for their manufacture. The developed devices allow us to evaluate mechanical characteristics of samples under the desired temperature conditions. An introduction of the developed devices has permitted to carry out an operative control on radial and flexural stiffness of intravascular endo-prostheses elements both under conditions of research investigations and during technological process of their manufacture. Currently, the devices are used to specify heat treatment regimes for nitin-ol wire from various manufacturers while manufacturing vascular endo-prostheses.  </p...|$|E

50|$|The bolt {{closes the}} breech {{end of the}} barrel and {{contains}} the firing pin. The bolt is held in place with a lever that fits into a notch. Moving this lever out of the notch will release the restraint on the bolt, allowing it to be drawn back. An extractor removes the spent cartridge, which is then ejected through the lever <b>slot.</b> A <b>spring</b> {{at the bottom of}} the magazine pushes up the reserve rounds, positioning the topmost between the bolt and the chamber at the base of the barrel. Pushing the bolt lever forward chambers this round and pushing the lever into the notch locks the bolt and enables the trigger mechanism. The complete cycle action also resets the firing pin. The Mauser rifle of the late 19th and early 20th centuries is the most famous of the bolt action types, with most similar weapons derived from this pioneering design, such as the M1903 Springfield and the Karabiner 98 Kurz rifle (abbreviated often as Kar98k or simply K98). The Russian Mosin-Nagant rifle, the British Lee-Enfield, and the Norwegian Krag-Jørgensen are examples of alternate bolt-action designs.|$|R
40|$|Bosch Rexroth in Mellansel {{develops}} and fabricates Hägglunds {{hydraulic motors}} among other things. One {{important component of}} the motor is the cam ring, which commonly affects the life span of the motor. The aim is to create the basis of a testing equipment where a loose cam ring can be tested. Previously, a complete motor has been used in order to test the fatigue resistance of the cam ring. In order to load the cam ring similar to the real case. FEM-analysis was performed to investigate how the cam ring is affected during loading and how the rig should be built for the strains to be similar to the real case. The result of this simulation was compiled in a Haighdiagram in order to get an indication of the magnitude of the stresses. The solution is a testing equipment which consist of a cylinder block which usually is in the motor. The cylinder block is bolted onto a bottom plate where the cam ring has a given position. The cam ring is fixated using a <b>sloted</b> <b>spring</b> pin and a dowel pin that keeps the cam ring in position and prevents potential torque. All pistons should be pressurised by pulsation at the same time using the same pressure, thus, the torque is expected to be zero. One of the holes which is holding the cam ring is oval, this is to allow deformation of the cam ring. The result of this work is a basic plan for the components included which affects the mechanical function of the testing equipment. A limitation of this work has been that the residual stresses in the clearance holes is unknown. These residual stresses have a great importance for fatigue resistance of the cam rings. As a consequence of this, it has been difficult to estimate which working pressure the test rig has to use in order to achieve the desired life span. Experimental testing when using the rig will indicate this. Task monotoring  The testing equipment will generate 1 - 10 million loading cycles before failure of the cam ring occurs. Will be achieved through experimental testing  Testing time should be reasonable, result would preferably be achieved within 2 - 4 weeks. Will be achieved through experimental testing  The testing equipment should be customised for a CA 50 - 50 cam ring. (CA 50 motor series strongest motor 50 Nm/bar) Achieved  Testing equipment should be usable with the current laboratory equipment of Bosh Rexroths (420 bars maximum preassure). Probably achieved  The crack needs to be detected in an appropriate way, to stop the testing. Achieved  The testing equipment {{needs to be able to}} be manufactured by using the developed blueprints. Achieve...|$|R

25|$|When Nintendo {{released}} the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately {{different from that}} of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console <b>slot</b> nickel connector <b>springs</b> would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.|$|R
