60|$|On {{reaching}} the churchyard and turning the corner towards the spot as usual, {{she was surprised}} to perceive another woman, also apparently a respectable widow, and with a tiny boy by her side, bending over Clark's turf, and <b>spudding</b> up with the point of her umbrella some ivy-roots that Selina had reverently planted there to form an evergreen mantle over the mound.|$|E
60|$|Naturally, {{to such a}} boy, {{the great}} {{ambition}} of his life was {{to be released from}} the hoeing and <b>spudding,</b> and set to work at his father's colliery. Great was Geordie's joy, therefore, when at last he was taken on there in the capacity of a coal-picker, to clear the loads from stones and rubbish. It wasn't a very dignified position, to be sure, but it was the first step that led the way to the construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Geordie was now fairly free from the uncongenial drudgery of farm life, and able to follow his own inclinations in the direction of mechanical labour. Besides, was he not earning the grand sum of sixpence a day as picker, increased to eightpence a little later on, when he rose to the more responsible and serious work of driving the gin-horse? A proud day indeed it was for him when, at fourteen, he was finally permitted to aid his father in firing the colliery engine; though he was still such a very small boy that he used to run away and hide when the owner went his rounds of inspection, for fear he should be thought too little to earn his untold wealth of a shilling a day in such a grown-up occupation. Humbler beginnings were never any man's who lived to become the honoured guest, not of kings and princes only, but of the truly greatest and noblest in the land.|$|E
60|$|George Stephenson {{was born}} in June, 1781, {{the son of a}} fireman who tended the pumping engine of the {{neighbouring}} colliery, and one of a penniless family of six children. So poor was his father, indeed, that the whole household lived in a single room, with bare floor and mud wall; and little Geordie grew up in his own unkempt fashion without any schooling whatever, not even knowing A from B when he was a big lad of seventeen. At an age when he ought to have been learning his letters, he was bird's-nesting in the fields or running errands to the Wylam shops; {{and as soon as he}} was old enough to earn a few pence by light work, he was set to tend cows at the magnificent wages of twopence a day, in the village of Dewley Burn, close by, to which his father had then removed. It might have seemed at first as though the future railway engineer was going to settle down quietly to the useful but uneventful life of an agricultural labourer; for from tending cows he proceeded in due time (with a splendid advance of twopence) to leading the horses at the plough, <b>spudding</b> thistles, and hoeing turnips on his employer's farm. But the native bent of a powerful mind usually shows itself very early; and even during the days when Geordie was still stumbling across the freshly ploughed clods or driving the cows to pasture with a bunch of hazel twigs, his taste for mechanics already made itself felt in a very marked and practical fashion. During all his leisure time, the future engineer and his chum Bill Thirlwall occupied themselves with making clay models of engines, and fitting up a winding machine with corks and twine like those which lifted the colliery baskets. Though Geordie Stephenson didn't go to school at the village teacher's, he was teaching himself in his own way by close observation and keen comprehension of all the machines and engines he could come across.|$|E

5000|$|The oldest form of {{drilling}} machinery is the cable tool, still used today. Specifically designed {{to raise and}} lower a bit into the bore hole, the <b>spudding</b> of the drill causes the bit to be raised and dropped onto {{the bottom of the}} hole, and the design of the cable causes the bit to twist at approximately [...] revolution per drop, thereby creating a drilling action. Unlike rotary drilling, cable tool drilling requires the drilling action to be stopped so that the bore hole can be bailed or emptied of drilled cuttings.|$|E
5000|$|The Quick Dump Valve is {{a recent}} {{addition}} to the choices of valves for <b>spudding.</b> A QDV is a spool valve that is balanced under pressure with {{one end of the}} spool oriented toward the barrel. The spool is manually unbalanced allowing pressure between the end of the spool and the projectile in the barrel. The air pressure then forces the spool back and the projectile forward. Since the valve is triggered with no pilot pressure, the valve snaps open with no pilot pressure to hinder it. Currently it is not commercially for sale and must be hand built by the hobbyist like most piston valves.|$|E

That well, and a subsequent one, failed. In 1921 the Union-Bell well blew in as a 2,500-barrel gusher and set off an oil rush by major oil companies and fly-by-night producers. Within a year the Santa Fe Springs oil field {{was considered one of}} the richest pools in petroleum history. Santa Fe Springs became a promoters' paradise. Prospective investors were bused into the field, served a free lunch in circus tents, and told stories about the fortunes made in oil. In 1923 the state legislature limited the amount of stock that could be sold in a well.|$|E

Because of the high production rate {{from the field}} and lack of storage and transport, the State of Texas Railroad Commission - the entity that oversees petroleum production - required a proration of the field {{for the first time in}} Texas history. Under this rule, all operators were given an equal share in the pipeline outlet based on what their wells could produce, based on the total field production. Additionally, operators were restricted in the depth they could drill into the cavernous reservoir, to give each an equal advantage.|$|E

40|$|Two bits were designed. One bit was {{fabricated}} {{and tested}} at Terra-Tek's Drilling Research Laboratory. Fabrication {{of the second}} bit was not completed due to complications in fabrication and meeting scheduled test dates at the test facility. A conical bit was tested in a Carthage Marble (compressive strength 14, 500 psi) and Sierra White Granite (compressive strength 28, 200 psi). During the testing, Hydraulic Horsepower, Bit Weight, Rotation Rate, were varied for the Conical Bit, a Varel Tricone Bit and Varel PDC bit. The Conical Bi did cut rock at a reasonable rate in both rocks. Beneficial effects from the near and through cutter water nozzles were not evident in the marble due to test conditions and were not conclusive in the granite due to test conditions. At atmospheric drilling, the Conical Bit's penetration rate {{was as good as}} the standard PDC bit and better than the Tricone Bit. Torque requirements for the Conical Bit were higher than that required for the Standard Bits. <b>Spudding</b> the conical bit into the rock required some care to avoid overloading the nose cutters. The nose design should be evaluated to improve the bit's <b>spudding</b> characteristics...|$|E

Every petroleum system has a source kitchen, identification of the location of the source kitchen or the direction of the source kitchen fosters better design considerations for exploration strategies, <b>spudding</b> of exploratory and production wells, development of oil fields and application of enhanced oil recovery techniques for fields with declined production rates.|$|E
30|$|The Venelle- 2 well is a {{directional}} {{exploratory well}} re-drilled {{from one of}} the existing dry wells with a total depth of 2200  m and reaching temperatures of approximately 350  °C, within the Lardarello Geothermal field in southern Tuscany in the close vicinity to the San Pompeo 2 well. The <b>spudding</b> operation began in the late August of 2017. The main aim of the project was to drill into the ‘K-horizon’ (i.e., an important seismic marker discovered from other deep drilling ventures in the area) located at depths of around 3000  m and reach supercritical geothermal resources. No production plans were made. During drilling operations, problems with partial and total circulation losses were experienced. One of the main challenges during drilling of the Venelle- 2 well was unexpectedly high pressures, encountered before reaching the target depths, which caused blow-out and eruption of tourmaline-quartz breccia and vein fragments. During cementing of a 7 ″ casing section, unexpected fire occurred around the well site and cementing was interrupted causing failure of casing equipment and slurry entry to the casing. The logging campaign performed after cementing operations proved large voids in cement sheath. The non-cemented sections at depth of 1205  m were cut off, while partially cemented sections between depths of 1205 and 1409  m were milled. Serious problems occurred during circulation stops with high density drilling fluid (1500  kg/m 3), which increased significantly wellhead pressure and caused problems while implementing standard well control procedures. The first stuck pipe incident occurred at a depth of 2695  m, which was attempted to release using firstly jarring and pulling up the drill string assembly and later by the decrease of drilling fluid density to 1350  kg/m 3. Problems with stuck pipe and circulation losses persisted and the well was eventually displaced with water in order to decrease well pressure and drilling fluid losses. Lower fluid pressures emphasized the need for reassessing well control and methods of circulation loss reduction using various squeezing and clogging techniques, which later proved to be unsuccessful. Challenges also occurred with setting up a swellable packer at greater depths in order to perform leak-off tests. Registering reliable temperature measurement was a serious issue in the Venelle- 2 venture, where multiple temperature logging tools and methods were exercised at various drilling depths. Static formation temperatures of 504  °C at a depth of 2815  m and between 507 and 517  °C at a depth of 2894  m were established from available logging tools. The Venelle- 2 well is currently temporarily abandoned with multiple cement plugs (Bretani et al. 2018).|$|E
