5|$|After being {{published}} in Belgium, the story began serialisation in neighbouring France; initially {{appearing in the}} magazine Cœurs Vaillants-Âmes Vaillants from 4 August 1940, the story was ultimately interrupted, and would only recommence in June 1945, {{this time in the}} magazine Message Aux Cœurs Vaillants. From December 1945 to May 1946 it then appeared in a youth <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> newspaper La Voix de l'Ouest under the title of Tintin et Milou au pays de l'or liquide ("Tintin and Snowy in the Land of Liquid Gold").|$|E

5|$|Beatty's first {{newspaper}} was the Beatty Bullfrog Miner, which began publishing in 1905 {{and went out}} of business in 1909. The Rhyolite Herald was the region's most important paper, starting in 1905 and reaching a circulation of 10,000 by 1909. It ceased publication in 1912, and the Beatty area had no newspaper from then until 1947. The Beatty Bulletin, a <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Goldfield News, was published from then through 1956.|$|E
5|$|By the {{conclusion}} of his combat tour in July 1942, Brennan had flown a total of twenty-two operational sorties and was credited with destroying 10 Axis aircraft over Malta, with one probably destroyed and a further 6 damaged. For his efforts {{in the destruction of}} Axis aircraft during this period, Brennan was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The notification of the decoration was published in a <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> London Gazette on 6 October 1942.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, {{a sudden}} {{eruption}} in Beerenberg forced the immediate evacuation of the station. A Hercules was {{dispatched to the}} island and successfully landed on the strip. Thereafter the Hercules became the regular military aircraft at Jan Mayen. Aircraft gradually took over more of the transport to the island, and from 1973 all supplies except diesel and special freight was transported by ship. From 1975 the 333 Squadron would occasionally drop mail and supplies using the P-3 Orion as a <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> landings of the Hercules.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the islanders}} were {{fishermen}} and crofters; some also worked as maritime pilots to guide vessels through the treacherous {{waters of the}} Pentland Firth. The tides and currents meant that shipwrecks were frequent—the most recent occurring in 1993—and salvage provided an additional though often illegal <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> islanders' incomes. A lighthouse was built on Stroma in 1890 and still operates under automation.|$|E
5|$|The journal had {{an archaeological}} and {{historical}} focus, {{and in the}} late nineteenth century that naturally meant that epigraphy (the study of inscriptions as writing rather than as literature) would be one of the principal subjects covered in its pages. Indeed, the Antiquary was the premier source of European scholarship on Indian epigraphy until the twentieth century and the official Indian government journal of epigraphy, the Epigraphia Indica, was published as a quarterly <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Antiquary between 1892 and 1920.|$|E

5|$|As the Great Depression hit the United States, Fairbanks bucked {{the poor}} {{economic}} trend. Thanks to the Alaska Railroad, large gold dredges {{could be brought}} in, and these returned the area's gold mines to profitability. In 1938, Lathrop {{took advantage of the}} good economic situation by reviving the Alaska Miner as a weekly <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> News-Miner. The Miner covered happenings in the gold-mining camps outside Fairbanks and was focused on areas outside the city. In 1939, Fairbanks radio station KFAR was founded, and it shared the Lathrop building with the News-Miner, which occupied the bottom floors of the building.|$|E
5|$|Davison later {{compiled}} {{a handful of}} writings—including letters, an obituary for H. G.

In 2011, Davison's selection of letters and journal entries were published as George Orwell: A Life in Letters and Diaries by Harvill Secker. A selection by Davison from Orwell's journalism and other writings were published by Harvill Secker in 2014 under the title Seeing Things as They Are.|$|E
5|$|In late September {{and early}} October, Wark {{commanded}} {{a company in}} the Ypres sector of Belgium during the Battle of Polygon Wood. On 29 September—the {{first day of the}} battle—Wark's men successfully repelled the leading waves of a German counter-attack and, with artillery support, drove off the remainder. Over the following three days, his constant patrolling and personal reconnaissance of the German positions enabled him to ascertain when they were massing for further counter-attacks; on one occasion he dispersed the assembling German troops with rifle fire and grenades. For his actions during the battle, Wark was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, the details of which were published in a <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> London Gazette on 3 June 1918.|$|E

5|$|On 15 May 1942 {{a special}} <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> London Gazette carried the {{announcement}} of 19 decorations; Frost was awarded the Military Cross (MC), Cook the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) and Cox the Military Medal (MM); there were two other DSCs, two Distinguished Service Medals (DSM), one other MC, two further MMs and nine Mentions in Despatches (MiD). Wing Commander Pickard was also subsequently awarded a bar to his Distinguished Service Order, on 26 May. The success of the raid also prompted the War Office to expand the existing British airborne forces, setting up the Airborne Forces Depot and Battle School in Derbyshire in April 1942, and creating the Parachute Regiment as well as converting a number of infantry battalions to airborne battalions in August 1942.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1918, Maxwell {{commanded}} a scouting patrol that was operating {{to the east}} of Ploegsteert. Having obtained the required information, he ordered the patrol to withdraw. He and three of his men were covering the withdrawal of the main body when he noticed about thirty Germans nearby. Recalling the patrol, he led an attack against the party, which had sheltered in an old trench; the Germans quickly withdrew, leaving three dead and one wounded prisoner of war. Maxwell was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during this engagement, news of which was published in a <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> London Gazette on 13 May 1918.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius {{listed the}} Gospel of the Hebrews in his Antilegomena {{as one of}} the disputed {{writings}} of the early Church. Despite this, the Church Fathers occasionally used it, with reservations, as a source to support their exegetical arguments. Eusebius reports that the 2nd century Church Father Hegesippus used the gospel as a source for writing his Hypomneumata ("Memoranda") in Rome (c.175–180). The Alexandrian Fathers – Clement, Origen, and Didymus the Blind – relied directly on the gospel to provide prooftexts as a <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canonical gospels. Clement quoted from the gospel as part of a discourse on divine Wisdom. Origen used it to compare differing views {{of the relationship between the}} Word and the Holy Spirit. Jerome claimed to have used the gospel as a prooftext, although he may have relied in part on excerpts from the commentaries of Origen. He quoted from it as a proof from prophecy based on Isaiah11.2 to explain how Jesus was the fulfillment of messianic expectations. The Gospel of the Hebrews was excluded from the canon by the Catholic Church with the closing of the New Testament canon at the end of the 4th century, and was no longer cited as a source in Church literature.|$|E
