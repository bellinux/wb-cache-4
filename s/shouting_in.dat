[...] His voice builds with his persona's increasing instability, eventually <b>shouting</b> <b>in</b> the heavy, guitar-backed chorus: [...] "See my only mind explode/ Since I've gone away". [...] After the second chorus there is a softer, creepy keyboard break by Buxton, and when the vocals reappear they repeat [...] "I wanna get out of here", at first tentative and imploring, before climaxing in the character's total mental breakdown {{and a return to}} the chorus.

500|$|Conversely, Todd McCarthy of Variety {{thought that}} the film should have {{remained}} an episode of Tales from the Crypt. Critic James Berardinelli believed that although The Frighteners wasn't [...] "a bad film", it was [...] "a disappointment, following Jackson's powerful, true-life matricide tale, Heavenly Creatures", {{and because of that}} [...] "The Frighteners fell short of expectations by being just one of many in the long line of 1996 summer movies." [...] Chicago Sun-Times Roger Ebert, felt that Jackson was more interested in prosthetic makeup designs, computer animation, and special effects than writing a cohesive storyline. Ebert and critic Gene Siskel gave it a [...] "two thumbs down" [...] rating on their TV show At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. Chicago Reader critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, described the film's special effects as [...] "ugly, aggressive" [...] and [...] "proliferating", saying that [...] "trying to keep interested in [...] was like trying to remain interested in a loudmouth <b>shouting</b> <b>in</b> [...] ear". Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle stated that [...] "instead of moving the horror genre in new directions, The Frighteners simply falls apart from its barrage of visual effects and the overmixed onslaught of Danny Elfman's music score". The Austin Chronicles Joey O'Brien, said that although the screenplay was [...] "practically loaded with wild ideas, knowingly campy dialogue and offbeat characterizations", it [...] "switched gears" [...] too fast and too frequently that [...] "the audience is left struggling to catch up as [...] twists and turns its way unmercifully towards a literally out-of-this-world finale".|$|E
500|$|Fighters Uncaged is a single-player-only {{fighting}} game controlled {{using the}} Kinect, a motion sensing input device. The player controls {{the protagonist of}} the game, Simon, through his attempts to win an illegal fighting tournament to help get his father out of trouble with a crime lord. The game features one gamemode called [...] "Fight" [...] which is only accessible after completing the tutorial. Fighters Uncaged is played in an over-the-shoulder perspective, with the opponent being on the opposite side. Simon {{is able to do}} a range of different actions, including short and long punches, kicks, blocks, dodges, and headbutts. The player can execute special moves via <b>shouting</b> <b>in</b> the direction of the Kinect, once the corresponding bar is full. Fighting consists of looking for telegraphs in the movements of one's opponents to figure out when to dodge or block attacks, then hitting them while they are vulnerable. In the early stages Fighters Uncaged, it is made less difficult to read the telegraphs of the opponent, but as the player progresses, they become increasingly imperceptible. The moves Simon can complete depend on where the opponent is at the time, and therefore only certain moves will land hits at particular moments. Fighters Uncaged features different leagues, with higher leagues being reached by having a certain number of points. Points are obtained by defeating the opponent, while having a good score. Good scores are attained by accomplishing counter attacks, exploiting the enemies weak spots, and correctly completing combos. If a good score is not secured {{at the end of the}} fight, no points are rewarded.|$|E

2500|$|In her own day, Christine de Pizan was {{primarily}} a court writer who wrote commissioned works for aristocratic families, as well as addressing literary debates of the era. In modern times, she has been labeled a poetic mediator who engaged with historical texts to interpolate her royal readers and encourage ethical and judicious conduct. Some rhetorical scholars have concluded, from studying her persuasive strategies, that she forged a rhetorical identity for herself and encouraged women to embrace this identity. Some have argued that Christine de Pizan [...] "began her literary career by singing, alone in her room, and she finished by <b>shouting</b> <b>in</b> the public square." [...] She left an influential footprint {{in the field of}} rhetorical discourse in an otherwise male-dominated literary field. She left forty-one surviving poetic works and a number of prose books.

2500|$|Norwood is a lyric contralto, {{with a range}} {{spanning}} three octaves {{and five}} semitones. Her voice has often been described as soft, raspy, and husky by music critics and Norwood herself.

He further describes her vocal quality, saying, [...] "Like little else in pop-music singing, Brandy's subtle manipulation of timbre and texture rewards close listening. [...] Her main claim of technical virtuosity has always been her long, cascading riffs, a skill many R die-hards revere her for." [...] Norwood is also noted for her use of multitrack recording to create intricate vocal arrangements and layering. Terry Sawyer of PopMatters writes on this skill, remarking, [...] "While it's been said that Brandy's voice isn't exactly a barn burner, it's not mentioned enough that she does more than enough with what she's got. She never leaves her voice hanging in spotlit scarcity, folding its variegated terracing, whispering out the lead track, <b>shouting</b> <b>in</b> the back-up, and piling each song with enough interlocking sounds to create the tightly packed illusion of vocal massiveness." ...|$|E
