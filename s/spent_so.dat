5|$|Leonard (Johnny Galecki), Sheldon, Raj (Kunal Nayyar) and Howard (Simon Helberg) are in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, {{waiting for}} Comic-Con tickets {{to go on}} sale online. After ten minutes of trying, Leonard finally gets in the queue but is 15,211th in line. Tickets run out and the four men are {{disappointed}} {{that they will not}} be able to attend, especially as they had <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> much time on their costumes, intending to go as different versions of the Hulk as portrayed by Lou Ferrigno, Eric Bana, Edward Norton, and Mark Ruffalo.|$|E
25|$|Sylvanus Morley {{was also}} {{to be remembered as}} a {{spokesman}} and representative of the Maya peoples, among whom he <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> much of his time, and who otherwise lacked the means to directly address some of their concerns with the wider public.|$|E
25|$|From 1978–1982, Micelli {{attended}} the University of the Arts in Philadelphia where the vibraphone {{caught his eye}} and ear. He <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> much time on vibraphone that he neglected his study of timpani, snare drum, and marimba. His teacher fought for him, and he passed.|$|E

60|$|Well, the {{skirmish}} {{has cost}} me £200. I wished for information--and I {{have had to}} pay for it. The information is got, the money is <b>spent,</b> and <b>so</b> this is the only mode of accounting amongst friends.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{smallest}} stations / halts, Les Combes, between Château-d'Œx and Rougemont, was given a new, raised platform during Autumn 2011 leaving only the waiting shelter as original, {{quite a lot of}} money <b>spent</b> for <b>so</b> few passengers.|$|R
25|$|Bale {{is a huge}} golf fan and has {{a replica}} of the 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass in his back garden. His love of golf was blamed by the Spanish media as the reason why he has <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> much time out injured for Real Madrid.|$|E
25|$|When the Supreme Court Building {{opened in}} 1935, McReynolds, {{like most of}} the other justices, refused to move his office into the new building; he {{continued}} to work out of the office he maintained in his apartment. His reason was that with the country in the turmoil of the Great Depression, it was unconscionable to have <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> much money on a single building.|$|E
25|$|Post World War II, {{and having}} <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> much time at Los Alamos, New Mexico, in 1947 he sought warmer climes than Rochester {{and moved to}} Kodak's Hollywood office with the {{introduction}} of Kodak's color film processing. Widmer helped introduce the new Eastman Color Negative and Positive Film, a multilayered color motion picture film that changed the dynamics of power in the movie industry.|$|E
50|$|Llewellyn was {{affiliated}} with the Frank Holton Company and worked part-time as a salesman for the Chicago branch of the company, where it is said he sold a remarkable number of instruments {{for the amount of}} time that he <b>spent</b> doing <b>so.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Never {{has there}} been a gayer Court. Twenty {{delightful}} kings did everything they could think of to make themselves agreeable, and after having <b>spent</b> ever <b>so</b> much money in giving a single entertainment thought themselves very lucky if the Princess said [...] "That's pretty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But listen, oh my lord judge!" [...] cried Abdallah. [...] "All {{that this}} man has spent I have given to him--I, who found the money. Yes, my lord, I have given it to him, and myself have <b>spent</b> not <b>so</b> much as single mite." ...|$|R
25|$|Because {{they were}} {{superseded}} {{so early in}} their lives by more modern forms of traction, and because they <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> much of their remaining lives stored for seasonal grain traffic and/or in poor condition, the R class achieved {{one of the lowest}} average mileages of any VR locomotive. The lowest was that of R 716, which recorded just 88,909 miles (143,085km) in just four years of service before being withdrawn in 1956 and scrapped in 1962.|$|E
25|$|According to Mahabharata, when Bhishma has to pick Dhritarashtra's successor, he {{mentions}} to Vidura many of Duryodhana's positive qualities {{in comparison to}} Yudhishthira. Having <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> {{many years in the}} forest, Yudhishthira doesn't have Duryodhana's experience, military expertise, education, and courtly manners. Bhishma adds that Duryodhana is loved by the people, while Yudhishthira is an unknown quantity to them. However, Bhishma ultimately selects Yudhishthira, telling Vidura that in his heart, Duryodhana is a power-hungry, vitriolic individual, while at his core, Yudhishthira is a good man who cares tremendously for his people.|$|E
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the army that Reza Shah had <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> much time and effort creating was humiliating. Many of the military generals had behaved incompetently or secretly sympathised with the British and ended up sabotaging the Iranian resistance. The army generals met in secret to discuss surrender options. When the Shah learned of the generals' actions, he beat {{the head of the}} armed forces General Ahmad Nakhjavan with a cane and physically stripped him of his rank. He was nearly shot by the Shah on the spot, but at the insistence of the Crown Prince, he was sent to prison instead.|$|E
60|$|It {{seems that}} coroner and jury had not <b>spent</b> quite <b>so</b> much time over luncheon {{as the more}} or less {{interested}} spectators. When the crowd began to file back again into the seats, the coroner had already examined and dismissed one witness and was questioning another.|$|R
50|$|The DoubleTap {{is unique}} in that it carries two {{chambered}} rounds, one in each barrel. It also carries two additional rounds in the grip which allow for reloading. The ambidextrous thumb latch releases the action and ejects the <b>spent</b> rounds <b>so</b> that the two backup rounds can be loaded.|$|R
60|$|The United States {{had been}} obliged {{to pay an}} immense sum {{on account of the}} {{contract}} with the War Syndicate, but this was considered money <b>so</b> well <b>spent,</b> and <b>so</b> much less than an ordinary war would have cost, that only the most violent anti-Administration journals ever alluded to it.|$|R
25|$|Finance {{should also}} be {{providing}} the information, analysis and advice to enable the organizations’ service managers to operate effectively. This goes beyond the traditional preoccupation with budgets – how much have we <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> far, {{how much do we}} have left to spend? It is about helping the organization to better understand its own performance. That means making the connections and understanding the relationships between given inputs – the resources brought to bear – and the outputs and outcomes that they achieve. It is also about understanding and actively managing risks within the organization and its activities.|$|E
25|$|Caesar {{felt that}} it would be much safer far away from Sulla should the Dictator change his mind, so he left Rome and joined the army, serving under Marcus Minucius Thermus in Asia and Servilius Isauricus in Cilicia. He served with distinction, winning the Civic Crown for his part in the Siege of Mytilene. He went on a mission to Bithynia to secure the {{assistance}} of King Nicomedes's fleet, but he <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> long at Nicomedes' court that rumours arose of an affair with the king, which Caesar vehemently denied {{for the rest of his}} life. Ironically, the loss of his priesthood had allowed him to pursue a military career, as the high priest of Jupiter was not permitted to touch a horse, sleep three nights outside his own bed or one night outside Rome, or look upon an army.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July 1960, Valentino met Giancarlo Giammetti at the Café de Paris on the Via Veneto in Rome. One {{of three}} children, Giammetti {{was in his}} second year of {{architecture}} school, living at home with his parents in the haut bourgeois Parioli section of Northern Rome. That day Giammetti gave Valentino a lift home in his Fiat and a friendship, as well as a long-lasting partnership, started. The day after, Giammetti was to leave for Capri for vacation and, by coincidence, Valentino was also going there, so they met again on the island 10 days later. Giammetti would shortly thereafter abandon the University to become Valentino's business partner. When Giammetti arrived, the business situation of Valentino's atelier was in fact not brilliant: in one year he had <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> much money that his father's associate pulled out of the business, and had to fight against bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|Shahbaz Khan {{was known}} for his {{generosity}} and liberality and the money he <b>spent</b> was <b>so</b> great that it made the people think that he had in his possession Philosopher's stone. He left behind a huge Jagir , treasures and other wealth. which was seized by Jahangir, son of Emperor Akbar after his death.|$|R
50|$|The city is {{connected}} to neighboring towns, Ilam, Pol Dokhtar and Abdanan by three main roads. The Darreh Shahr-Ilam route has undergone development projects. Since {{the beginning of the}} project about 62 km have been turned into 2+1 highway with reversible lane. The state government has <b>spent</b> $21M <b>so</b> far and it requires $35M more to finish the project.|$|R
60|$|The {{consequence}} was, it put {{arms into}} the hands of his subjects to rebel against him; it embroiled him with his Parliament in England, to whom he was fain to stoop in a fatal and unusual manner to get money, all his own being <b>spent,</b> and <b>so</b> to buy off the Scots whom he could not beat off.|$|R
25|$|In 1937, Ahn {{was invited}} to Dublin, Ireland, to perform Symphonic Fantasy Korea. It easily won the Irish audience, as Ireland had been under British rule just as Korea was under the Japanese rule. He {{then went back to}} Vienna and met with the famous {{composer}} Richard Strauss to discuss his Symphonic Fantasy Korea. At the same time, Ahn was attending the Eötvös Loránd University on a scholarship from the Hungarian government, and, in 1939, Ahn graduated from the University. Complimenting Ahn on his talent, Strauss appointed Ahn to conduct a concert in Budapest in place of himself. Unfortunately, Ahn had <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> many hours in preparing for the concert that he collapsed during the last song. Despite this, the Hungarian newspapers praised Ahn for his efforts. At Strauss's recommendation, the Rome Philharmonic Orchestra gladly accepted Ahn as its conductor; many other orchestras across Europe followed, and Ahn travelled all over Europe to perform.|$|E
25|$|The first {{scheduled}} service with a Class 72 train occurred on 8 August 2002 on the Jæren Commuter Rail. NSB {{stated that they}} had never previously <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> much time testing equipment before putting it into service, and that the Jæren had been chosen for the introduction because the single-line system was easier to operate than the services around Oslo. The company also stated that they hoped all the trains would be in service by the end of 2003. By January 2003, half the trains had been delivered, and were gradually being put into service on the Oslo Commuter Rail. However, on the Gardermoen Line the electronics from the train were interfering with the signaling systems, so the lights would switch from green to red before the train passed, instead of afterwards. This made it impossible for the NSB to put the train into service on Norway's only high-speed line. Another problem was that the trains would not close the doors if they were at a station without level tracks, although this was quickly solved. In 2003, NSB decided to abandon the Puls concept, and revert to the former single-profile strategy.|$|E
25|$|This {{period of}} {{official}} life from 1830 to 1848 was <b>spent,</b> <b>so</b> far as philosophical study was concerned, in revising his former lectures and writings, in maturing them for publication or reissue, and in research into certain periods of the sophical history of philosophy. In 1835 appeared De la Métaphysique d'Aristote, suivi d'un essai de traduction du premier et du douzième livres; in 1836, Cours de philosophie professé à la faculté des lettres pendant l'année 1818, and Œuvres inédites d'Abélard. This Cours de philosophie appeared later in 1854 as Du vrai, du beau, et du bien. From 1825 to 1840 appeared Cours de l'histoire de la philosophie, in 1829 Manuel de l'histoire de la philosophie de Tennemann, {{translated from the}} German. In 1840–1841 we have Cours d'histoire de la philosophie morale au XVIIIe siècle (5 vols.). In 1841 appeared his edition of the Œuvres philosophiques de Maine-de-Biran; in 1842, Leçons de philosophie sur Kant (Eng. trans. AG Henderson, 1854), {{and in the same}} year Des Pensées de Pascal. The Nouveaux fragments were gathered together and republished in 1847. Later, in 1859, appeared Petri Abaelardi Opera.|$|E
60|$|Phoebe looked quite appalled as {{she entered}} the schoolroom, not only at Mervyn's {{fulfilment}} of his threat, but at Bertha's flippancy and shrewdness. Hitherto she had been kept ignorant of evil, save what history and her own heart could tell her. But these ten days had been <b>spent</b> in <b>so</b> eagerly studying the world, that her girlish chatter was fearfully precocious.|$|R
30|$|In {{determination}} of service level based on ATS and PTSF based on HCM 2000, generally, service level based on ATS {{in comparison to}} service level based on PTSF is in better condition, it means that divers have higher average speed and they almost {{pay no attention to}} traffic distance headway and time <b>spent</b> following, <b>so,</b> safety is less and disasters are more.|$|R

25|$|Tailchaser's Song begins, after quoting {{a poem by}} Christopher Smart, with an {{exposition}} of the central elements of the cats' mythology, starting with a creation myth. This both frames the further developments of cat mythology and culture throughout the story and provides necessary backstory for the novel itself. Meerclar Allmother is identified as the primordial creator of all other beings, who brought forth a pair of cats who are the progenitors of the entire species as well as divine figures. Harar Goldeneye is the male, and Fela Skydancer the female. The first litter of this pair are also divine. These three cats are called the Firstborn; the middle child, Grizraz Hearteater, raises a monstrous hound out of jealousy and sets it to attack all cats. The eldest of the three, Viror Whitewind, slays the creature but is himself mortally wounded. Hearteater is driven out and flees beneath the ground where he searches out arcane lore, while Whitewind's death causes his father to flee to the heavens after searching for Hearteater in a murderous rage and causes his mother to be silent {{for the rest of}} his life. His youngest brother, Tangaloor Firefoot, renounced his claim to the throne and fled from the court out of grief. As a result of a further encounter with Firefoot, Hearteater is blinded by sun after having <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> much time beneath the earth, and retreats back beneath the ground, where it is supposed that he plots further destruction.|$|E
500|$|... "He {{described}} the Issaquah crime scene , {{and it was}} almost like he was just there", Keppel said. [...] "Like he was seeing everything. He was infatuated with the idea because he <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> much time there. He is just totally consumed with murder all the time." [...] Nelson's impressions were similar: [...] "It was the absolute misogyny of his crimes that stunned me," [...] she wrote, [...] "his manifest rage against women. He had no compassion at all ... he was totally engrossed in the details. His murders were his life's accomplishments." ...|$|E
500|$|The Second Test in Cape Town saw an Australian victory, {{the first}} in Davidson's 14 Tests. He took 2/31 and 2/18 as South Africa lost by an innings after being forced to follow on. It was during this match that Davidson earned his famous {{reputation}} for injury complaints, something that became {{a constant source of}} humour; he <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> much time on the massage table that his teammates attached a plaque that read [...] "The AK Davidson Autograph Treatment Table". Benaud reported that Davidson persistently complained to captain Craig about an injury before delivering the next ball with high pace and swing.|$|E
25|$|He placed those {{below his}} poverty line {{into two groups}} {{depending}} on the reason for their poverty. Those in primary poverty {{did not have enough}} income to meet the expenditure necessary for their basic needs. Those classed as in secondary poverty had high enough income to meet basic needs but this money was being <b>spent</b> elsewhere <b>so</b> they were unable to then afford the necessities of life.|$|R
