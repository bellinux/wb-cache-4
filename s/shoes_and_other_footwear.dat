50|$|Visitors and worshipers {{to large}} Hindu temples may be {{required}} to deposit their <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>footwear</b> before entering. Where this is expected, the temples provide an area and help staff to store footwear. Dress codes vary. It is customary in temples in Kerala, for men to remove shirts and to cover pants and shorts with a traditional cloth known as a Vasthiram. In Java and Bali (Indonesia), before one enters the most sacred parts of a Hindu temple, shirts are required as well as Sarong around one's waist. At many other locations, this formality is unnecessary.|$|E

30|$|We used a t-test {{to compare}} the peak pressure, peak shear force, and stance time. We also {{calculated}} the cross-correlation coefficient between the waveforms.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the relative prevalences of different types of fetishes, scientists obtained a sample of at least 5000 individuals worldwide from 381 Internet discussion groups. The relative prevalences were estimated based on (a) the number of groups devoted to a particular fetish, (b) the number of individuals participating in the groups and (c) the number of messages exchanged. Using these measures, feet <b>and</b> <b>shoes</b> were found to be the most common target of preferences. This is consistent with an analysis of millions of search queries by users from the USA that were accidentally released during the AOL search data scandal. Sixty-four (64) percent of the sampled population that had a preference for an object associated with the body had a preference for <b>shoes,</b> boots, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>footwear.</b>|$|R
30|$|The subject walked using (a) {{simulated}} barefoot, usual shoes (boots), leather <b>shoes,</b> <b>and</b> therapeutic <b>shoes,</b> respectively. By {{comparing the}} measured values of (a) barefoot {{with those of}} the different footwear, we evaluated the system by examining whether the effect of reducing the pressure and shear force could be measured. By comparing when the usual <b>shoes</b> (boots) <b>and</b> the <b>other</b> <b>footwear</b> were worn, we examined whether their differences caused by the characteristics of the footwear, such as weight, hardness of the heel region and shapes, could be measured. Leather shoes were selected for two major reasons. One was that leather shoes are commonly used. The other is that they are different from boots <b>and</b> therapeutic <b>shoes</b> in terms of the shoelace, weight, hardness of the heel region, etc. Therapeutic shoes used in this evaluation were for prevention of foot ulceration. Generally, the shoes are used with custom-made insoles designed to closely fit the plantar of the patient. Because the subject did not have foot deformities, we used commercially available insoles for the measurement instead of custom-made insoles.|$|R
