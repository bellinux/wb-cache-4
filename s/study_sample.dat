2500|$|In 2003, Spitzer {{published}} {{the paper in}} the Archives of Sexual Behavior. Spitzer's study has been criticized on numerous ethical and methodological grounds, and [...] "press releases from both NGLTF and HRC sought to undermine Spitzer's credibility by connecting him politically to right-wing groups that had backed the ex-gay movement". Gay activists argued that the study would be used by conservatives to undermine gay rights. Spitzer acknowledged that the <b>study</b> <b>sample</b> consisted of people who sought treatment primarily because of their religious beliefs (93% of the sample), served in various church-related functions, and who publicly spoke in favor of changing homosexual orientation (78%), and thus were strongly motivated to overreport success. Critics felt he dismissed this source of bias, without even attempting to measure deception or self-deception (a standard practice in self-reporting psychological tests like MMPI-2). That participants had to rely upon their memories of what their feelings were before treatment may have distorted the findings. It was impossible to determine whether any change that occurred {{was due to the}} treatment because it was not clear what it involved and there was no control group. Spitzer's own data showed that claims of change were reflected mostly in changes in self-labelling and behavior, less in attractions, and least in the homoerotic content during the masturbatory fantasies; this particular finding was consistent with other studies in this area. Participants may have been bisexual before treatment. Follow-up studies were not conducted. Spitzer stressed the limitations of his study. Spitzer said that the number of gay people who could successfully become heterosexual was likely to be [...] "pretty low", and conceded that his subjects were [...] "unusually religious".|$|E

External Validity is very important when it comes to statistical research because you want to make sure that you have a correct depiction of the population. When external validity is low, the credibility of your research comes into doubt. Reducing threats to external validity can be done by making sure there is a random sampling of participants and random assignment as well.|$|E

Benefits of acupuncture for treatment of nystagmus include a reduction in frequency and decreased slow phase velocities which led {{to an increase in}} foveation duration periods both during and after treatment. By the standards of evidence-based medicine, the quality of these studies can be considered poor (for example, Ishikawa has a <b>study</b> <b>sample</b> size of just six, is unblinded and without proper control), and given high quality studies showing that acupuncture has no effect beyond placebo, the results of these studies have to be considered clinically irrelevant until higher quality studies are produced.|$|E

50|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of several small studies does not predict {{the results of}} a single large study. Some have argued that a weakness of the method is that sources of bias are not controlled by the method: a good meta-analysis cannot correct for poor design and/or bias in the original studies. This would mean that only methodologically sound studies should be included in a meta-analysis, a practice called 'best evidence synthesis'. Other meta-analysts would include weaker studies, and add a study-level predictor variable that reflects the methodological quality of the studies to examine the effect of study quality on the effect size. However, others have argued that a better approach is to preserve information about the variance in the <b>study</b> <b>sample,</b> casting as wide a net as possible, and that methodological selection criteria introduce unwanted subjectivity, defeating the purpose of the approach.|$|E

5000|$|Pollock and coauthors {{made three}} key {{contributions}} to community structure theory. First, they conducted {{among the first}} US nationwide and cross-national studies using the community structure model, comparing multiple large metropolitan areas and countries, expanding <b>study</b> <b>sample</b> sizes beyond a focus {{on one or two}} cities. Second, Pollock et al. also evolved the theory to include a Media Vector methodological tool for measuring both content direction and editorial prominence of articles, then combining them into a single score, thereby adding a way to consider editorial evaluation as well as article content. Third, Pollock and coauthor findings often challenged the traditional “guard dog” hypothesis by concluding that media can often reflect the interests of more vulnerable stakeholders. Community structure studies are related to work focusing on the roles of social capital (in political science and sociology literatures) and social determinants of health (in health communication and public health literatures) and social ecological models (in sociology and public health). In 2008, Pollock authored the entry on the [...] "Community Structure model" [...] for the International Encyclopedia of Communication, and in 2013, he authored an authoritative annotated bibliography on Community Structure scholarship for Oxford Bibliographies Online.|$|E
