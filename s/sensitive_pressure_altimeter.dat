40|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} that the minimum surface pressure for hurricane Daisy, observed at 1945 GMT, August 27, 1958, should be 948 mb. and not 935 mb. as reported in [l]. The reason for this error is as follows. The flight altitude pressure on board the aircraft from which the dropsonde determination of the surface pressure was made was given as 485 mb. The <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> altitude was given as 18, 400 ft. This is not possible. In the ICAO Standard Atmosphere, a pressure of 485 mb. corresponds to a <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> reading of 19, 020 it. This value as the corrected <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> altitude, the reported radar altitude of 18, 800 ft., and the temperature and moisture values transmitted by the dropsonde were used to rework the sounding on an adiabatic chart.

50|$|Altitude can be {{determined}} based on the measurement of atmospheric pressure. The greater the altitude, the lower the pressure. When a barometer is supplied with a nonlinear calibration so as to indicate altitude, the instrument is called a <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> or barometric <b>altimeter.</b> A <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> is the altimeter found in most aircraft, and skydivers use wrist-mounted versions for similar purposes. Hikers and mountain climbers use wrist-mounted or hand-held altimeters, {{in addition to other}} navigational tools such as a map, magnetic compass, or GPS receiver.|$|R
50|$|A {{microbarometer}} {{used as a}} <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> {{would be}} able to resolve altitude differences on the order of centimeters, but for the presence of infrasonic noise such as microbaroms.|$|R
50|$|On {{the flight}} deck, the {{definitive}} instrument for measuring altitude is the <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter,</b> {{which is an}} aneroid barometer with a front face indicating distance (feet or metres) instead of atmospheric pressure.|$|R
500|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter,</b> {{also known}} as the {{barometric}} altimeter, is used to determine changes in air pressure that occur as the aircraft's altitude changes. [...] <b>Pressure</b> <b>altimeters</b> must be calibrated prior to flight to register the pressure as an altitude above sea level. [...] The instrument case of the altimeter is airtight and has a vent to the static port. [...] Inside the instrument, there is a sealed aneroid barometer. [...] As pressure in the case decreases, the internal barometer expands, which is mechanically translated into a determination of altitude. [...] The reverse is true when descending from higher to lower altitudes.|$|R
25|$|Later {{the same}} year (1996), Aeroper√∫ Flight 603, also {{operated}} with a Boeing 757, suffered a similar but far more difficult situation (static ports blocked by tape, rendering all airspeed indicators and <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeters</b> unusable) and crashed in the ocean off Peru.|$|R
50|$|The radio {{altimeter}} gave a true {{reading of the}} airplane's altitude {{when it was over}} the sea. Over land, the {{radio altimeter}} only gave the altitude over the land below. Without knowing the elevation of the land, it wasn't possible to know the true altitude. The <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> gave the same readings over land or sea, but it could not distinguish between a change in air pressure caused by a change in altitude and a change in air pressure caused by a change in barometric pressure. Therefore, the <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> was only accurate to a range of altitudes. By using both altimeters together over the ocean, it was possible to determine the true altitude, the true air pressure at that altitude and the pressure at other altitudes at that point.|$|R

50|$|Flight {{levels are}} used to ensure safe {{vertical}} separation between aircraft, despite natural local variations in atmospheric air pressure. Historically, altitude has been measured using a <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter,</b> which is essentially a calibrated barometer. An altimeter measures ambient air pressure, which decreases with increasing altitude following the barometric formula. It then calculates and displays the corresponding altitude.|$|R
50|$|The zero {{reference}} in use is usually implied by context, and these words are added only when clarification is needed. Tire pressure {{and blood pressure}} are gauge pressures by convention, while atmospheric pressures, deep vacuum <b>pressures,</b> and <b>altimeter</b> <b>pressures</b> must be absolute.|$|R
5000|$|Altimeter {{setting is}} the value of the {{atmospheric}} pressure used to adjust the sub-scale of a <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> so that it indicates the height of an aircraft above a known reference surface. This reference can be the mean sea level pressure (QNH), the pressure at the nearby surface airport or the pressure level of [...] which gives the standard flight levels ...|$|R
50|$|Global Positioning System (GPS) {{receivers}} {{can also}} determine altitude by trilateration with {{four or more}} satellites. In aircraft, altitude determined using autonomous GPS is not reliable enough to supersede the <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> without using some method of augmentation. In hiking and climbing, {{it is not uncommon}} to find that the altitude measured by GPS is off by as much as 400 feet depending on satellite orientation.|$|R
50|$|The actual {{height of}} an {{aircraft}} {{is based on}} the use of a <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> (see flight level for more detail). The heights quoted here are thus the nominal heights under standard conditions of temperature and pressure rather than the actual heights. All aircraft operating on flight levels calibrate altimeters to the same standard setting regardless of the actual sea level pressure, so little risk of collision arises.|$|R
25|$|Barometers and <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeters</b> (the {{most basic}} and {{common type of}} altimeter) are {{essentially}} the same instrument, but used for different purposes. An altimeter {{is intended to be}} transported from place to place matching the atmospheric pressure to the corresponding altitude, while a barometer is kept stationary and measures subtle pressure changes caused by weather. The main exception to this is ships at sea, which can use a barometer because their elevation does not change.|$|R
50|$|In 1958 the {{standard}} vertical separation {{was set to}} 1,000 feet from the surface to FL290, and 2,000 feet above FL290. This was because {{the accuracy of the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> (used to determine altitude) decreases with height. Work on reducing this to 1,000 feet at all levels began almost immediately, {{but it was not until}} the 1990s that air data computers (ADCs), altimeters and autopilots became sufficiently accurate to make this a reality.|$|R
25|$|Expert {{commentators}} {{have noted that}} the flight navigator, who was listing the altitude readings on the transcript, {{was referring to the}} radar altimeter (which gives height above ground) rather than the <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter</b> (which would provide the height relative {{to the level of the}} runway). Because the terrain rises up to the runway, this could have had the effect of causing the pilot to fly far too low. The Final Report confirms this is exactly what happened.|$|R

50|$|The {{investigation}} into the accident revealed serious errors made by the crew in the last moments of the flight. Most significant was {{the decision to go}} approach number two, followed the errors in calculating altitude resulting inflated altitude readings resulting in a premature decline at a trajectory too low. The committee in charge of the accident investigation declared that the main cause of the accident was called a premature decline caused by crew error in setting the air <b>pressure</b> <b>altimeter,</b> flying in too dense fog to navigate a visual approach on approach number two. The secondary reason cited was the blatant violation by the crew of the approach procedures and the lack of control by the crew of the aircraft on setting the radio altimeter reduction.|$|R
