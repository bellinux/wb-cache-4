2500|$|Duce was [...] "having a shit day and couldn’t {{be bothered}} to [...] vocal [...] an {{instrumental}} [...] I had," [...] {{which resulted in the}} creation of [...] "Had Enough". According to Thrower, the [...] "distils everything that we’re about." [...] With [...] "Boomerang", the group wanted to, according to Duce, [...] "do a pop track and see what comes out." [...] Discussing [...] "Work for It", Duce explained that you [...] "either have a choice to <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> arse and hope things come your way or get up, get to work and put in the effort and perseverance." [...] The song was initially inspired by Duce's brother and sister receiving their GCSE results, [...] "but it morphed into a song about me sorting my life out and focusing on my career in music." [...] Duce wrote [...] "Could Be Worse" [...] for himself [...] "because things could always be worse." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kim Skotte of Politiken {{wrote that}} [...] "there are images—many images—in Melancholia which {{underline}} that Lars von Trier {{is a unique}} film storyteller", and [...] "the choice of material and treatment of it underlines Lars von Trier's originality." [...] Skotte also compared it to the director's previous film: [...] "Through its material and look, Melancholia creates rifts, but unlike Antichrist I don't {{feel that there is}} a fence pole in the rift which is smashed directly down into the meat. You <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> seat in the cinema and mildly marveled go along in the end of the world." [...] Berlingskes Ebbe Iversen wrote about the film: [...] "It is big, it is enigmatic, and now and then rather irritating. But it is also a visionary work, which makes a gigantic impression." [...] The critic continued: [...] "From time to time the film moves on the edge of kitsch, but with Justine played by Kirsten Dunst and Claire played by Charlotte Gainsbourg as the leading characters, Melancholia is a bold, uneven, unruly and completely unforgettable film." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Come on! We can't {{stay here}} talking. Let's {{go down and}} <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> porch." [...] She {{mechanically}} obeyed him, and they started on together down the hill again; {{but she did not}} offer to take his arm, and he kept the width of the roadway from her.|$|E

6000|$|... "The cares of matrimony age a man rapidly," [...] Pollio said laughing, [...] "though doubtless {{they sit}} lightly on your huge shoulders. Why, you could let my little cousin <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> hand and hold her out at arm's length.

5000|$|Stefon {{returned}} to the Weekend Update desk in a guest appearance along with Amy Poehler to wish Seth Meyers good luck in his final Weekend Update, as Meyers prepares to become the new host of Late Night. Stefons jokes included that the world (outside of SNL) [...] "has everything...", such as homeless weightlifters that look like The Croods, Japanese daredevil YOLO Ono and human DVRs, to which Stefon replied [...] "Its that thing where a midget <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> TV and tells you what happened on Scandal. And like a regular cable box, it goes down all the time". Before Seths final Weekend Update goodbye, he acknowledged Stefon as his husband. In this appearance, Hader again broke character after the human DVR joke.|$|R
6000|$|So {{they waited}} till dark, {{and then the}} Leopard heard {{something}} breathing sniffily in the starlight that fell all stripy through the branches, and he jumped at the noise, and it smelt like Zebra, {{and it felt like}} Zebra, and when he knocked it down it kicked like Zebra, but he couldn't see it.

6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} would succeed yet,--I {{knew you would}}, if I could only have a little patience. I've been scolding myself ever since you went. I {{thought you were going}} to do {{something}} desperate, and I had driven you to it. But Bartley, Bartley! It can't be true, is it? Here, here! Do take this fan.

[...] Madison Vain of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "the brooding, expansive song <b>sits</b> heavy <b>on</b> <b>your</b> chest — and the video matches." ...|$|R
