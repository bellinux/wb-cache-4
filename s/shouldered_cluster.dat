40|$|The {{opportunity}} for obtaining different wines {{from the same}} variety cultivated in the same vineyard is becoming of increasing importance. This is why some wine cellars have started to assay {{the separation of the}} tips and shoulders berries of the clusters of a specific variety with this objective.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a more and more competitive market, the opportunity to obtain different wines from the same variety cultivated in the same vineyard is becoming of increasing importance. In this study the presence of aroma compounds in Gran Negro (Vitis vinifera L.) grapes was investigated in order to obtain its aroma potential fingerprint taking into consideration the separation of apical (tips) and basal (shoulders) berries of the clusters. In the final stages of maturation, differences were searched in the probable alcohol content, total acidity of the must, {{as well as in the}} aromatic composition of skin and flesh from <b>shoulder</b> and <b>cluster</b> tip berries. A GC-MS method was used to determine the aromatic composition. The obtained results showed that there was variability for their aromatic composition. These results are promising for those wine cellars that are considering the separation of berries from tips and <b>shoulders</b> of the <b>clusters</b> for the elaboration of wines with different qualities. For the berries from the tips of the clusters, aromatic alcohols and volatile phenols were mainly found in the flesh (15 and 2 times higher than in the skin, respectively); whereas aldehydes and C 6 alcohols were mainly in the skin (4 and 3 times higher than in the flesh, respectively). For this reason, it could be recommended to separate berry skin before enzymatic maceration of the berry flesh must. For the berries from the <b>shoulders</b> of the <b>clusters,</b> the group of volatile phenols showed 2 times more concentration in the skin than in the flesh; it could be recommended to maintain berry skin during enzymatic maceration of the must. Overall, the tips showed a 40 % lower level of C 6 alcohols (contributing to herbaceous nuances). These results from Gran Negro were compared with those of Brancellao and Mouratón cultivars. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{presence}} of aroma compounds in grapes of Brancellao (Vitis vinifera L.) was investigated {{in order to obtain}} its aroma potential fingerprint. It is well known that differences exist in aromatic compounds amongst grapevine varieties at ripening stages. Within the framework of an increasingly competitive market, the chance of obtaining different wines from vines of the same variety grown at the same vineyard is becoming of increasing importance. This can be done through the managing of the vineyard, but also some wineries have assayed the separation of the tip and shoulder berries of the clusters of a specific variety with this objective. In this work it is evaluated that, {{in the final stages of}} maturation, differences exist in the probable alcoholic degree, total acidity of the must, as well as in the aromatic composition of skin and flesh of berries coming from the tips and <b>shoulders</b> of the <b>clusters.</b> Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to determine the aromatic composition, in the skin and flesh of each sample, either tip or shoulder berries from the clusters. The obtained results showed that there was not variability for the probable alcoholic degree and total acidity between the shoulders and tips, whereas there was variability for their aromatic composition. For the berries from the tips of the clusters most of volatiles were found in the flesh (except aldehydes) and spicy and floral nuances (with the only exception of β-ionone) were in higher proportions. For the berries from the <b>shoulders</b> of the <b>clusters,</b> most of volatiles were found in the skin (monoterpenes, norisoprenoids, aldehydes, and C 6 alcohols), where the flesh was slightly richer in aromatic alcohols, volatile phenols and pantolactone; β-ionone and herbaceous nuances were in higher proportions. These results are promising for those wineries that are considering the chance of separating berries from tips and <b>shoulders</b> of the <b>clusters</b> for the elaboration of different quality wines. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background: Shoulders of {{throwing}} and swimming athletes are highly stressed joints that often show structural abnormalities on {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI). However, while water polo players exhibit a combination {{of throwing}} and swimming move-ments, a specific pattern of pathological findings has not been described. Purpose: To assess specific MRI abnormalities in shoulders of elite water polo players and to compare these findings with a healthy control group. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: After performing a power analysis, volunteers were recruited for this study. Both shoulders of 28 semiprofessional water polo players and 15 healthy volunteers were assessed clinically (based on the Constant score) and had bilateral shoulder MRIs. The <b>shoulders</b> were <b>clustered</b> into 3 groups: 28 throwing and 28 nonthrowing shoulders of water polo athletes and 30 shoulders of healthy control subjects. Results: Twenty-eight male water polo players {{with an average age}} of 24 years and 15 healthy subjects (30 shoulders) with an average age of 31 years were examined. Compared with controls, significantly more MRI abnormalities in the water polo players’ throwing shoulders could be found in the subscapularis, infraspinatus, and posterior labrum (P. 001, P. 024, and P. 041, respectively). Other structures showed no statistical differences between the 3 groups, including the supraspinatus tendon, which had abnormalities in 36 % of throwing versus 32 % of nonthrowing shoulders and 33 % of control shoulders.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} an HST WFPC 2 search for star clusters in active star-formation regions of M 31. Nine of the clusters were previously cataloged and 77 are new. Our 23 fields cover key areas of the galaxy's recent star formation activity. We provide a catalog of positions and integrated magnitudes in four colors, taken with the 336 W, 439 W, 555 W and 814 W filters with the Hubble Space Telescope. A future paper will discuss the results of stellar photometry in some of the clusters in six colors, including two additional uv colors (Bianchi et al. 2010). The integrated magnitudes and colors of the clusters show a range of characteristics, but the mean color is bluer than for previous surveys, reflecting the concentration of our sample on active star forming regions. Absolute magnitudes range from M 555 = - 10. 3 to - 3. 5. The observed luminosity function shows a nearly Gaussian distribution with a peak value at M 555 = - 5. 4 and a <b>shoulder</b> of unusually-bright <b>clusters.</b> We look in detail at two of these unusually bright examples, cluster 45 (C 410) and cluster 10 (BH 05). C 410 lies at the core of a bright HII region. Its absolute magnitude is M 555 = - 10. 3. BH 05 is a similar object, with an absolute magnitude of M 555 = - 8. 9.

40|$|Despite a large {{prevalence}} of rotator cuff impingements or tears {{in the elderly}} population, little {{research has focused on}} understanding how this population adapts to perform tasks of daily living. Past research has focused on the analysis of upper limb kinematics of young healthy individuals while performing these essential tasks (Magermans, 2004, Murray and Johnson., 2004). The purpose of this thesis was to identify kinematic and shoulder loading differences between elderly mobile individuals and elderly individuals with rotator cuff impingements during specific activities of daily living. Motion capture techniques were used in combination with the Shoulder Loading Analysis Modules (Dickerson, 2005, Dickerson et al., 2007) to estimate thoracohumeral kinematics and calculate external joint moments. Two-tailed t-tests with injury status as the factor determined that differences in active range of motion in flexion/extension and humeral rotations existed between the two populations. Results of the ADL analysis showed that the impinged population tended to have decreased plane of elevation and humeral rotations during ADLs. Task was also a main factor for most variables examined. Perineal care, hair-combing and reaching tasks were the most demanding in terms of range of motion necessary to complete the task. The reaching tasks resulted in the highest <b>shoulder</b> moment. K-means <b>clustering</b> techniques proved to be unsuccessful in identifying different motion strategies between the two study groups. This investigation showed that developing adaptations for perineal care, hair-combing and reaching tasks should be considered a priority when working with patients with rotator cuff impingements, as these tasks demanded the largest ranges of motion as well as high shoulder moments...|$|R
40|$|Galicia (N. W. Spain) is a Spanish {{region with}} several old-traditional winegrowing areas. There are {{autochthonous}} grapevine varieties, such as Vitis vinifera L. cv. Mouratón, considered a biodiversity resource in viticulture {{and an opportunity}} for Galician sustainable wine production. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} assess the potential of traditional cultivars to produce quality red wines. In this work, anthocyanin and flavonol evolution was followed in red berries from V. vinifera L. cv. Mouratón. The novelty {{of this study is that}} grapes were separately collected from two different positions (tips and <b>shoulders)</b> within the <b>cluster,</b> over ripening to examine the effects of berry position within the fruit cluster on the flavonoid compounds. Derivatives of five anthocyanins (malvidin, peonidin, petunidin, delphinidin and cyanidin) and derivatives of six flavonols (quercetin, myricetin, kaempherol, laricitrin isorhamnetin and syringetin) were detected in both positions within the cluster. Dynamic of anthocyanins (from 819 mg/kg to 1206 mg/kg in tips; and from 786 mg/kg to 1077 mg/kg in shoulders) and dynamic of flavonols (from 25 mg/kg to 41 mg/kg in tips; and from 18 mg/kg to 21 mg/kg in shoulders) confirmed their upward trends over ripening. Grapes located inside the shoulder bunch receive less sunlight radiation than those located inside the tip bunch and this fact could explain the different accumulation observed for both positions. These results can be useful for winemakers in order to obtain different final red wine quality.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{characteristics of}} body structure and their time trend among young women, we obtained 63 anthropometric measurements from women aged 18 or 19. All the 585 subjects were new {{students in a}} women's university in Kobe, Japan in 1982, 1984, 1987 and 1992. Sixty-three measurements involved items regarding height, length, girth, width, depth and others of diverse parts of the body. The results obtained were summarized as follows : (1) out of 63 items, 37 accepted the null hypothesis that the distribution was a normal one. Most of the items which rejected the hypothesis were those pertaining to width, girth or depth. (2) A total of 51 items increased in an average of the measurement during the 10 -year study period. The largest increase appeared in acromion height, and its value was 2. 3 cm. Twenty-two items including stature and body weight showed an increment over 1 in the absolute values. (3) Seven factors explaining body structure were extracted through factor analysis on the data of 63 measurements for the 585 subjects. Their cumulative contribution rate reached 88 %. Taking the items having factor loadings higher than 0. 4 in respective factors into consideration, we could regard the 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th, 5 th, 6 th and the 7 th factors as size factor, shape factor, shape of the back, shape of the chest, size of shoulders, shape of the neck and slope of <b>shoulders,</b> respectively. (4) <b>Cluster</b> analysis using the factor scores revealed {{that the proportion of}} women having larger size and shape factors increased in these 10 years, and women with enlarged shape of the chests, more slender necks and flat shoulders also increased.
