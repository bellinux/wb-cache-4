40|$|Orifice-to-orifice {{inconsistencies}} in data acquired with an electronically-scanned pressure {{system at the}} beginning of a wind tunnel experiment forced modifications to the standard, instrument calibration procedures. These modifications included a large increase in the number of calibration points which would allow a critical examination of the calibration curve-fit process, and a subsequent post-test reduction of the pressure data. Evaluation of these data has resulted in an improved functional representation of the pressure-voltage signature for electronically-scanned pressures sensors, which can reduce the errors due to calibration curve fit to under 0. 10 percent of reading compared to the manufacturer specified 0. 10 percent of full scale. Application of the improved calibration function allows a more rational selection of the calibration <b>set-point</b> <b>pressures.</b> These pressures should be adjusted to achieve a voltage output which matches the physical shape of the pressure-voltage signature of the sensor. This process is conducted in lieu of the more traditional approach where a calibration pressure is specified and the resulting sensor voltage is recorded. The fifteen calibrations acquired over the two-week duration of the wind tunnel test were further used to perform a preliminary, statistical assessment of the variation in the calibration process. The results allowed the estimation of the bias uncertainty for a single instrument calibration; and, they form the precursor for more extensive and more controlled studies in the laboratory...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} a steady state simulation {{model of a}} multistage crude oil production plant. The unstable reservoir fluid is separated into crude oil and gas in a three stage gas oil separation plant. Peng Robinson Equation of State and successive substitution is used to model the separators. The liquid output for the third stage separators is stable crude oil and the crude oil is sold on the international market. The gas liberated in the separators is compressed by centrifugal compressors and injected into the reservoir. Several methods for modelling centrifugal compressors are discussed. The discussion concludes that Dimensionless Parameters is the best suited method for this case and this method is therefore used. The plant studied has three separation stages at decreasing pressure and the standard control method is to use fixed separator pressure. This is not optimal and brute force optimization is used to find the optimal <b>pressure</b> <b>set-points.</b> Adaptive <b>pressure</b> <b>set-points</b> will improve product separation and therefore increase the profit. The profit is calculated as the income from crude oil sale minus the energy cost. Using this new method, the optimum separator pressures for Snorre A are determined.

In anesthetized, artificially ventilated dogs, we distended the vascularly isolated carotid sinuses with a pulsatile pressure and recorded isometric tension in an upper tracheal segment. The aortic nerves were cut. Increasing mean carotid sinus pressure in steps between 100 and 200 mm Hg decreased tracheal tension, heart rate, and arterial blood pressure; decreasing sinus pressure between 100 and 25 mm Hg had the opposite effect. Changing carotid sinus pressure still evoked tracheal responses when systemic arterial pressure was held constant. Increasing and decreasing carotid sinus pulse pressure around a constant mean pressure evoked similar changes in tracheal tension. All reflex effects were abolished by cutting or cooling (0 Â°C) the carotid sinus nerves; tracheal responses were abolished by cutting the laryngeal nerves or administering atropine.

40|$|In {{variable}} {{air volume}} (VAV) systems, conventional control strategies reset the supply air static pressure {{based on the}} opening degrees of all the VAV dampers. However, such methods are not robust because the supply air static <b>pressure</b> <b>set-point</b> will gradually increase to its high limit in case some VAV terminals are abnormal. Such abnormal happens quite often as a survey reported that 20. 1 % of the VAV terminals were ineffective in the field. This study provides a practically applicable fault tolerant control strategy for VAV systems. Instead of using VAV damper positions which contain limited information of space thermal comfort, the developed strategy utilizes other available information for the optimal control. A statistical method is also used in this strategy. After a throughout in-situ test, the strategy has been permanently implemented in all office floors (142, 000 m 2) in a high-rise building since July of year 2014.

40|$|The use of {{pressure}} control to reduce leakage is well known. The benefit is significantly increased if pressures are controlled {{in response to}} changes in demand or flow. To achieve this, {{it is necessary to}} enable the pressure controller to sense both flows and the corresponding pressures, thereby avoiding unnecessarily high system pressures. In the implementation of a pressure management scheme for leakage reduction, both steady state and dynamic aspects should be considered. The steady state aspects ensure that the <b>set-points</b> of a <b>pressure</b> reducing valve (PRV) are changed according to an optimal profile so as to minimize background leakage and to satisfy pressure requirements at critical points. The dynamic aspects ensure that excessive pressure changes (oscillations) caused by interactions between modulating valves and transients in water networks are not generated across the distribution networks. This paper will focus on the dynamic aspects {{of pressure}} control. A new control scheme is presented to achieve fully flow modulated dynamic pressure control. The proposed controller is based essentially on a PRV dynamic model, and the flow modulated pressure control is achieved using both pressure and flow information.

Eskom {{is under}} {{increasing}} pressure to provide reliable and sustainable electricity. Demand Side Management (DSM), offers a shortâ€“ to mediumâ€“term {{solution to this}} problem. During 2009, the mining sector consumed approximately 16 % of the domestic electricity supplied by Eskom. This made the mining sector {{one of the major}} targets for Eskomâ€“initiated DSM programmes. The mining industry uses compressed air {{for a wide variety of}} applications and production purposes. This creates many opportunities to reduce electricity consumption and operating costs. Reducing the airsystem demand may however not result in significant electrical energy savings, unless the compressedâ€“air supply is accurately managed to meet the reduced demand. Until recently, compressor control in the mining sector generally consisted of operating the compressors continuously, regardless of the actual demand for compressed air. Excessive compressed air is blown off into the atmosphere resulting in energy loss. This usually occurs when the compressors are operated manually. A computerâ€“controlled compressor management solution, which optimises the efficiency potential of the compressedâ€“air supply, is required to obtain significant electrical energy savings. The need for such a solution was addressed by the development of an energy management solution for mine compressor systems. This solution is referred to as Energy Management System (EMS) and is capable of starting, stopping, loading and unloading compressors. In addition to this, compressor output can be controlled to maintain a desired <b>pressure</b> <b>setâ€“point.</b> In this study, the development and implementation of EMS on ten different mine compressor systems is presented. Automatic compressor capacity control was implemented, while an operator manually initiated compressor starting; stopping; loading and unloading, according to EMS control schedules. Centralised compressor control is one of the main advantages offered by EMS, especially for compressedâ€“air systems with multiple compressor systems at different geographic locations.

However, when the <b>set-point</b> for blood <b>pressure</b> is chronically elevated, hypertension occurs. Hypertension if untreated can lead to further complications including heart failure, stroke and kidney failure. Elevated sympathetic outflow is known {{to contribute to the}} development and/or maintenance of hypertension, and while the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), a preautonomic center, has been implicated in the elevation of sympathetic activity during hypertension, the precise pathophysiological mechanisms underlying sympathoexcitation remain unclear. Subthreshold ion channels, including the A-type K +(I A) and the T-type Ca 2 +(I T), are important mechanisms regulating the ability of neurons to generate firing activity, and changes in I Aactivity have been reported during hypertension. Thus, the first aim of the study focused on characterizing the basic biophysical and functional properties of I Ain presympathetic PVN neurons projecting to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (PVN-RVLM). Our studies demonstrated the presence of a functionally relevant I Ain PVN-RVLM neurons, which actively modulated the action potential waveform and firing activity. The second aim {{of the study was to}} determine whether alterations in the biophysical properties of I Acontributed to enhanced neuronal excitability of PVN-RVLM neurons during hypertension. Our studies indicated that diminished I Aavailability constituted a contributing mechanism underlying hyperexcitability in these neurons during hypertension. Previous studies have indicated an opposing balance between the subthreshold ion channels, I Aand I T. Thus, the final aim of the study assessed the biophysical competition between I Aand I T, and functionally addressed the influence of such balance on the activity of PVN-RVLM neurons under normal and hypertensive conditions. Our studies indicated that the balance between I Aand I Twas shifted during hypertension in favor of I Tactivity, resulting in increased I T-dependent low threshold spikes, elevated intracellular calcium levels, and enhanced basal spontaneous firing activity during this condition. Taken together, this study confirms the importance of intrinsic factors, in particular the balance between opposing subthreshold conductances, in regulating the central control of cardiovascular output under normal and pathological conditions...|$|R

We recorded baroreceptor impulses from the left aortic nerve, and measured aortic pressure with a catheter-tip transducer and external aortic diameter with ultrasonic transit-time transducers. Narrow anticlockwise hysteresis loops were evident in the pressure-diameter relationship of the upper thoracic aorta, both during the rapid pulsatile pressure changes of the cardiac cycle and during the slow excursions of mean pressure imposed for construction of baroreceptor pressure [...] response curves. In contrast to the 'phase-lag' response of diameter to pressure, the baroreceptor response was 'phaselead' in character, decreasing when stress-induced creep occurred in the aortic wall. When the mean arterial <b>pressure</b> <b>set-point</b> was increased from 100 to 125 mmHg for 20 min, the hysteresis loops relating mean diameter to mean pressure in the range 60 - 200 mmHg were displaced along the diameter axis in the direction of wall creep. A reduction in the baroreceptor response to pressure (i. e. resetting) always accompanied this displacement. Administration of ouabain (25 - 35 micrograms/kg) had no consistent effect on baroreceptor resetting. It has been suggested that acute baroreceptor resetting is akin to adaptation. To investigate the possibility that the two processes are accompanied by similar changes in aortic wall properties, we converted the aorta into a closed sac and distended it with a square wave of pressure. Like resetting, adaptation of the baroreceptor response to maintained pressure was associated with a small degree of creep of the aortic wall. Our results are compatible with the hypothesis that acute hypertensive resetting of aortic baroreceptors is similar to adaptation, both phenomena being attributable to relaxation of viscoelastic coupling elements, leading to a reduction of strain at the receptor membrane. Whether viscoelastic processes alone can account for acute resetting, or whether changes in ionic balance are involved also, baroreceptor responsiveness {{is a function of the}} stress history of the wall, the pressure-response curve moving along the pressure axis in the direction of the prevailing set-point. Hence, in early hypertension physiological resetting of baroreceptors will precede pathological resetting, and may even promote an upward movement of set-point...|$|R

We discuss knowledges on the short-term control of CV system, focusing on the analysis of CV time-series and control of arterial pressure and RR-interval. In {{the first and second}} sections, we introduce modelling concepts which lead us to the definition of a possible decentralised control of CV system, with several baroreflex control loops, and at a time-discrete approach for the estimation of their sensitivities. We consider two types of vascular compartment: a passive one composed of elastin and collagen fibers, and an active one characterised in addition by smooth muscle. Passive vascular compartment modelling leads us to introduce the classical Windkessel model, widely applied for blood pressure curve analyses. We demonstrate that Windkessel model can be derived from a distributed model of the vascular compartment by a three-point discretisation of the one-dimensional partial differential equations of blood flow. We relate the definition of the vascular resistance and compliance to physical peculiarities of the local vessel wall. Looking for a possible mechano-chemical command of the heart function, we conceive a hierarchical control of the heart, separating the mechanical from the chemical control of the cardiac pump. We model the aortic and carotid baroreceptors, considering the three different steps of transduction: baroreceptor sensitivity to the inside pressure, pressure-deformation transduction process and deformation neural firing rate transduction process. The model is based on accumulated physiological and histological evidences and incorporates a local sympathetic feedback mechanism. We demonstrate that the knowledge {{of the history of the}} time derivative of the vessel wall stress is rich enough to allow the estimation of the inner baroreceptor pressure without the need of a <b>pressure</b> <b>set-point.</b> Active vascular compartment modelling leads us to consider blood pressure in the compartment as an output of the model. Whereas state variables are blood volume of the vascular compartment, the strain and stress of smooth muscles which are controlled by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and by a local control of blood oxygenation. Finally, we conceive the plan of a possible CV controller. In our point of view, the ANS regulates blood flow and pressure in different parts of the CV system with local feedback loops supposed to be fast and efficient. We demonstrate the necessary existence of negative and positive feedbacks: negative for blood pressure and/or flow, positive for blood flow. In the third section, we introduce actual knowledges and clinical relevance of (i) the origin of CV variability and (ii) of baroreflex mechanism, relating these concepts to CV modelling. In the last sections, we develop classical methods of CV spectral and time varying analysis, applying them in clinical conditions. A joint time-frequency distribution, the Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD) and an harmonic analysis method, the Complex Demodulation (CDM), are evaluated on synthetic and real CV time-series. We show the ability of this SPWVD-CDM to estimate the instantaneous amplitude and frequency of CV oscillations and the instantaneous phase between respiratory and CV oscillations...|$|R
