5|$|On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda terrorists {{struck the}} World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people. In response, the United States {{launched}} the War on Terror, which included war in Afghanistan and the 2003–11 Iraq War.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), the {{subsequent}} peace treaties ceded the region to Albania. This turn of events catalyzed an uprising among the local Greeks, which led to the Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence, on February 28, 1914. The International Commission of Control, an organization responsible for securing peace and <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> eventually intervened and the Protocol of Corfu was signed on May 17, 1914. However the protocol’s terms were never implemented because of the politically unstable situation in Albania following the outbreak of World War I, and it was eventually annulled in 1921 during the Conference of Ambassadors.|$|E

40|$|A spatial {{avalanche}} {{model is}} introduced, in which avalanches increase <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>regions</b> where they occur.

These shocks leave behind a signature [...] a distinct power [...] law crossover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> avalanche size distribution.

25|$|Ling Tong {{was more}} than just a {{military}} serviceman – he received high praise from the scholar-gentry for his gracious demeanour, bonhomie and generosity. Even though he had achieved fame and glory when he visited his hometown later in his life, he still treated commoners with utmost respect and humanity. Behind the frontline, Ling Tong conceived a strategy for dealing with and pacifying the Shanyue tribes – impressing them with a show of military might and offering them potential rewards – which led to the Wu government successfully recruiting over 10,000 Shanyue soldiers into their army and maintaining relative <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> Ling Tong was also known for his integrity and loyalty; he, along with Lü Meng, were among Sun Quan's most valued generals.|$|E
25|$|By {{the terms}} of the Protocol of Florence, the Greek {{government}} was obliged to evacuate its forces from the area to the new Greco-Albanian border line. The Greek government however raised concerns about the evacuation process of the Greek forces, pointing out to the Great Powers that the newly established Albanian state was unable to secure the region immediately. In particular the Greek government and the local population feared the possibility of reprisals and atrocities at the hands of Albanian irregular groups. In order to arrange the details of the evacuation with the International Commission of Control, an organization set up by the Great Powers to secure peace and <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> the Greek prefect of Corfu moved to Vlorë, where the provisional government of Albania was based. Meanwhile, the Greek authorities reassured the local Greek population that the Greek government would undertake initiatives to secure for them recognition of minority status and rights in Albanian legislation. The Greek authorities also warned the population of the town of Korçë (Greek: Korytsa) that any action against incorporation into Albania would be fruitless. They also insisted that the Greek army would only hand over control of the region to regular Albanian units led by Dutch officers from the International Commission, whereas the Greek forces would fire upon any irregular Albanian bands who attempted to enter the region.|$|E

500|$|Clark {{returned}} to the European theater and the Balkans following his USSOUTHCOM position when he was appointed to U.S. European Command {{in the summer of}} 1997 by President Clinton. He was, as with SOUTHCOM, not the original nominee for the position. The Army had already selected another general for the post. Because President Clinton and General Shalikashvili believed Clark was the best man for the post, he eventually received the nomination. Shalikashvili noted he [...] "had a very strong role in [...] last two jobs." [...] Clark noted during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services committee of the 105th Congress that he believed NATO had shifted {{since the end of the}} Cold War from protecting Europe from the Soviet Union to working towards more general <b>stability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> Clark also addressed issues related to his then-current command of USSOUTHCOM, such as support for the School of the Americas and his belief that the United States must continue aid to some South American nations to effectively fight the War on Drugs. Clark was quickly confirmed by a voice vote the same day as his confirmation hearing, giving him the command of 109,000 American troops, their 150,000 family members, 50,000 civilians aiding the military, and all American military activities in 89 countries and territories of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The position made Clark the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), which granted him overall command of NATO military forces in Europe.|$|E
