Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune acknowledged it as the [...] "speed metal prototype", but felt the lyrical replication of Judas Priest and the Misfits kept the album short from becoming a classic. In a retrospective review, Billboard praised Kill 'Em All for changing the face of popular music with its unique combination of punk and metal. AllMusic's Steve Huey called it [...] "the true birth of thrash". He praised Hetfield's highly technical rhythm guitar style and said that the band was [...] "playing with tightly controlled fury even at the most ridiculously fast tempos". Rob Kemp, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide, credited the album for consolidating the punk rock and heavy metal scenes, but felt that apart from [...] "Seek & Destroy" [...] and [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth", most of the album had the band [...] "trying to look tough" [...] over enthusiastic but unfinished riff-based songs.

He noted the album did not receive much critical praise {{at the time of its}} release, but said it aged well and opened the doors for the less commercially successful bands. Although McIver credits Venom's Welcome to Hell (1981) as the first thrash metal album, he acknowledged Kill 'Em All as a major influence on the flourishing American heavy metal scene.

[...] A Melody Maker critic awarded the album an unconventional 12/10 and deemed it superior to highly acclaimed predecessor Parklife, while noting that [...] "Blur understand the geometry of the song, and {{the basic principles of}} pop, better than anyone today". Less enthused was <b>Spin</b> journalist <b>Chuck</b> Eddy, who felt the LP ranged from [...] "wonderful" [...] to [...] "detached and emotionally stiff". The Great Escape was named as one of the 10 best records of 1995 in Melody Maker, NME, Q magazine, Raw and Select. NME readers voted it the third-best album of the year.|$|R

500|$|The {{first major}} {{breakthrough}} in the band's critical reception was 1990's NaÃ¯ve, called [...] "one of their strongest releases" [...] by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, [...] "brilliant" [...] by fellow AllMusic critic Ned Raggett, [...] "superb" [...] by Hinds, and [...] "the most fun 'industrial dance' album ever" [...] by <b>Spin</b> critic <b>Chuck</b> Eddy.

Michael Saunders of the Boston Globe said of the band: [...] "It's a small field, but KMFDM is tops in it: makers of dense, danceable, post-industrial torrents of noise.

[...] MacDonald said in 1996, [...] "With Ministry gone grindcore, Skinny Puppy just gone, and Nine Inch Nails a brand name, KMFDM is now the standard bearer of industrial", though Erlewine and Hinds felt the band was losing some steam {{towards the end of the}} decade.|$|R
5000|$|Dusty in Memphis has {{frequently}} been {{named one of}} the greatest albums of all-time; according to Acclaimed Music, it is the 104th most ranked record on critics' all-time lists. NME named it the 54th greatest album ever in their 1993 list, and in 2003, Rolling Stone ranked the record 89th on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Richie Unterberger wrote in AllMusic that the album's reputation has improved significantly over time and felt it was [...] "deserving of its classic status". Tony Scherman from Entertainment Weekly said Dusty in Memphis was a [...] "pure gem", Springfield's greatest work, and perhaps one of the greatest pop records ever recorded, Q took note of its balance between [...] "R&B and sensitive pop dramas", while <b>Spin</b> critic <b>Chuck</b> Eddy viewed it as one of the all-important blue-eyed soul records. In The A.V. Club, Keith Phipps wrote that Springfield and her team of musicians and producers for Dusty in Memphis developed an elegant and distinct fusion of pop and R&B that predated the Philadelphia soul sound of the 1970s. According to Eric Klinger from PopMatters, its sophisticated style of music influenced the sound of 1990s trip hop artists who sampled songs from the album and became a blueprint for British female singers of the 2000s, including Adele, Rumer, and Duffy.|$|R
500|$|The {{media and}} fans alike varied between intrigue and {{skepticism}} at the band's appearance and presentation.

[...] In a 2002 <b>Spin</b> magazine article, <b>Chuck</b> Klosterman wondered, [...] "how can two media-savvy kids posing as brother and sister, wearing Dr. Seuss clothes, represent blood-and-bones Detroit, a city whose greatest resource is asphalt?"

5000|$|As of July 2007, KMFDM {{had sold}} {{approximately}} two million records worldwide. Critics {{have been widely}} positive of KMFDM, though less enthusiastic about the band's earliest work. What Do You Know, Deutschland? was called [...] "less energetic" [...] and Don't Blow Your Top was called [...] "a little flimsy" [...] in comparison to later albums by AllMusic critics Andy Hinds and Vincent Jeffries, respectively. UAIOE, when the band's sound began to develop, was called [...] "more assured" [...] by Hinds and [...] "more representative of KMFDM's true motives" [...] by Thompson, who added that KMFDM's guitar-heavy sound inspired Ministry's own embrace of the instrument after the bands toured together in 1990.The first major breakthrough in the band's critical reception was 1990's NaÃ¯ve, called [...] "one of their strongest releases" [...] by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, [...] "brilliant" [...] by fellow AllMusic critic Ned Raggett, [...] "superb" [...] by Hinds, and [...] "the most fun 'industrial dance' album ever" [...] by <b>Spin</b> critic <b>Chuck</b> Eddy.

Kill Em All was released on July 25, 1983 by Megaforce with an initial pressing of 15,000 copies. Because of the labels financial restrictions, the album was pressed in batches of 500 copies. Kill Em All had sold 17,000 copies in the U.S. by the end of the year. Similarly to punk rock acts, Metallica promoted its material through the tape trading network and independent music magazines such as Metal Forces in the UK and Metal Mania in the U.S. The album did not enter the Billboard 200 chart until 1986, when it peaked at number 155 following Metallicas commercial success with its third studio album Master of Puppets. The 1988 re-issue on Elektra Records also charted on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 120. It was certified 3Ã— Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1999 for shipping three million copies in the United States. Despite being the lowest selling Metallica studio album, it helped the band establish its image and build a fanbase in its inaugural years. Kill Em All, as the first thrash metal album released in the U.S., had substantial impact on the emerging scene and inspired numerous bands with its aggression and austere seriousness. Guitarist Kerry King acknowledged Slayer was still finding its sound while Metallica had already determined its image and musical identity. Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian was impressed by the albums heaviness and songwriting, and said it influenced him as much as the albums by Iron Maiden. Dream Theaters drummer Mike Portnoy observed that Kill Em All surpassed the NWOBHM bands in terms of sheer velocity and cited Burtons bass solo as the albums peak. Guitarist Ulf Cederlund of Swedish black metal band Morbid cited [...] "Motorbreath" [...] and [...] "Metal Militia" [...] as songs that influenced him as a young musician. Kill Em All was ranked at number 35 on Rolling Stones list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the 80s. Additionally, the album placed at number 54 on [...] "The 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time" [...] and again at number 35 on [...] "100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time", two lists compiled by the same magazine. Kerrang! listed the album at number 29 among the [...] "100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time". In 2010, Consequence of Sound ranked it number 94 among its [...] "Top 100 Albums Ever".|$|R
