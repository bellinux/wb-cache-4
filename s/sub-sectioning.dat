40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{preparation}} of wood samples for high-resolution reflected-light microscopy in combination with a species-specific image analysis system is introduced. The method {{is based on an}} ultraprecise single-point diamond flycutter equipped with air bearings and functions {{on the basis of a}} rotating diamond edge. Extensive and very smooth surfaces can be produced on increment cores as well as entire cross sections. Hence, this technique provides the prerequisites for a continuous microscopic analysis across large tree-ring sequences, or entire cross sections. Patching or <b>sub-sectioning</b> is not required. The high-resolution analysis of cell structures of spruce and oak presented here introduces new approaches for describing and predicting reactions of diameter growth to various environmental events...|$|E
40|$|A {{random sample}} of 490 Tabellaria {{specimens}} was analyzed using the harmonic amplitudes of the Fourier transformations of their valve outlines as shape descriptors. Principal component analysis (PCA) {{was applied to the}} sample to reduce dimensionality. The problem of non-normal distribution of these descriptors due to cell division was solved by <b>sub-sectioning</b> the entire data set based on its distribution on the first three components (PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3) of the overall PCA. Each of the subsets was then analyzed by PCA. Shape groups from subset clusters were compared with one another and then similar groups were congregated into one growth series. Eight distinct shape groups were found. The results agree with some previous classical observations on the genus {{and at the same time}} reveal many new morphological characteristics related to valve shape. These new characteristics are impossible to obtain without appropriate specimen sampling, quantitative shape description, and data analysis techniques...|$|E
40|$|Reliability is an {{important}} factor in flexible pavement design to consider the variability associated with the design inputs. In this study, subgrade strength variability and flexible pavement designs are evaluated for reliability. The effects of weak subgrade on pavement design and performance prediction are evaluated through a case study using Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG). Permanent deformation or rutting is very sensitive to subgrade strength. International roughness index (IRI) is sensitive to the subgrade strength. Six existing pavement sections' design data are studied to examine the effect of variability associated with subgrade strength and selection criteria of subgrade strength for design. Parameters such as: mean, maximum likelihood, median, coefficient of variation and density distribution function of R-value are determined. A sub-section procedure is employed to deal with variability associated with subgrade strength in flexible pavement design. A single design for roadway sections does not yield an effective design regarding target reliability, while the <b>sub-sectioning</b> procedure is presented as a better way to deal with the subgrade variability. Minimum R-value assessment for making the decision of sub-excavation is also performed. Design outputs are compared for mean, maximum likelihood and median R-value inputs in terms of reliability and thickness using different design procedures. The reliability of the flexible pavement design is also evaluated for hot mix asphalt (HMA) properties in this study. Alternative designs are recommended for the existing pavements by modifying material inputs to mitigate different distresses with target reliability.

50|$|During World War I, the Propaganda <b>Sub-Section</b> was {{established}} under the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) Military Intelligence Branch within the Executive Division of the General Staff in early 1918. Although they produced most propaganda, the AEF Propaganda <b>Sub-Section</b> {{did not produce}} {{a few of the}} leaflets. General Pershing is supposed to have personally composed Leaflet “Y,” Austria Is Out of the War, which was run off on First Army presses, but distributed by the Propaganda <b>Sub-Section.</b> That <b>Sub-Section,</b> perhaps reflecting some professional jealousy, thought the leaflet sound in principle, but too prolix and a little too “brotherly.” Corps and Army presses issued several small leaflet editions containing a “news flash,” after the <b>Sub-Section</b> had approved their content. But in one or two cases that approval was not obtained, and in one unfortunate example a leaflet in Romanian committed the Allies and the United States to the union of all Romanians in Austria-Hungary with Romania. Such geopolitics was emphatically not the job of AEF propaganda and had the potential to cause serious embarrassment.|$|R
50|$|Sri Krishna Kirtana {{consists}} of 417 Bengali padas (verses) and 133 (total 161, 28 shlokas are repeated twice) Sanskrit shlokas, which were also probably composed by the poet. The extant work {{is divided into}} 13 khandas (sections), namely, Janma (birth), Tamvula (piper betel which was considered as a token of love in that time), Dana (tax-collection), Nauka (boat), Bhara (burden), Vrindavana, Yamuna, Bana (arrow), Vamshi (flute) and Radha Viraha (estrangement of Radha) (the last khanda is not named by the poet). Yamuna khanda is further divided into three <b>sub-sections.</b> The first <b>sub-section</b> is Kaliya Damana khanda (coercion of Kaliya, the snake-demon section), and the third <b>sub-section</b> is Hara khanda (necklace section). The name of the second <b>sub-section</b> has not {{been found in the}} manuscript, but its subject matter is Radha's vastraharana (stealing Radha's robes). Bhara Khanda {{consists of}} a <b>sub-section,</b> named Chatra khanda (umbrella section). Three characters, Krishna, Radha and Badayi, the messenger interrelate the plot of the play. Dialogues and counter-dialogues in payar and tripadi meters have added to the dramatic quality of Sri Krishna Kirtana.|$|R
