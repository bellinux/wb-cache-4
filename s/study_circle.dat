40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis is}} {{about women and}} their {{participation}} in <b>study</b> <b>circles</b> in the industrial town of Deje between 1950 - 1970. The purpose of this Bachelor thesis {{is to examine the}} participation of women in <b>study</b> <b>circles</b> in an industrial town. The research questions for my thesis are the following: 1. How did the participation of <b>study</b> <b>circles</b> look like in the industrial town of Deje between the years 1950 - 1970 ? 2. In which <b>study</b> <b>circles</b> did women participate in during the research period and how can it be understood in relation to the surrounding industrial town? My research includes qualitative studies of literature, protocols, attendance lists and documents concerning ABF’s work that´s archived in Archives centre in Karlstad. My research has also consisted of quantitative studies as interpretive methods have been used in the survey. I have been looking into ABF’s documentation concerning the activity in Deje to see which <b>study</b> <b>circles</b> the people in Deje participated in and compared them to how the choose what they studied. The theory that I have chosen for this thesis is Yvonne Hirdman´s theory about “Gender contract”. The subject I researched in changed a lot during these 20 years that was researched. During the 1950 s, the women was a minority when it came to <b>study</b> <b>circles.</b> Most people who studied consisted in majority of men and there was just a few women in some of the <b>circles.</b> The <b>study</b> <b>circles</b> changed during the 1960 s when women started to study more than earlier. It created more circles that there were only women in and men had since before a lot circles where it rarely appeared women in. This did not create more equal circles during these years, instead it created more <b>study</b> <b>circles</b> that were sex-segregated. It was also during the 1960 s more <b>study</b> <b>circles</b> that was related to work and especially to the paper and mass factory that was in Deje during this time. The <b>study</b> <b>circles</b> which were related to the work place had no female participants, but a few years after got more women into the <b>study</b> <b>circles</b> and whom could be connected with their standard of living in Deje during this time. The results of the research have also shown that Deje alone to have it this way. Both Lesjöfors and Munkfors were towns that had similar standards and that show us that industrial towns work in similar ways during this period...|$|R

A member of the party's <b>Study</b> <b>Circle,</b> he took part in drafting a new party program (a 1935 initiative taken by Ion Mihalache and Mihai Ralea, it also involved the left-wingers Ernest Ene, Mihail Ghelmegeanu, and Petre Andrei).|$|E

Hillman was arrested shortly thereafter for his revolutionary activities and sat in prison for several months, where he learned more about revolutionary social theory from fellow prisoners.|$|E
25|$|By 1899, Junimea {{was again}} merged into the Conservative Party. That year, Catargiu died, leaving open {{the issue of}} his {{succession}} to the Conservative Chairmanship. Carp {{took part in the}} subsequent race, but lost to Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino, who probably received decisive support from King Carol. During the election, Carp found himself a new adversary, in the person of Take Ionescu. This highly popular and young Conservative, who preserved strong links with the PNL, helped swing the vote in favor of Cantacuzino. Carp sincerely believed that Ionescu was a problem for the Conservative Party, and stated that his major goal was proving to the world that Ionescu was not a genuine politician. He was especially vexed by Ionescu's indifference to an unwritten law, according to which the King had an ultimate say in foreign policies. Carp's influence was also being contested by the new current formed around the Conservative <b>Study</b> <b>Circle.</b> Through its speakers Filipescu and Dimitrie S. Nenițescu, the Circle began analyzing the need for complex electoral reforms. Filipescu admired the senior leader, but Carp felt that the generation gap was unbridgeable.|$|E

The system of crossborder <b>study</b> <b>circles</b> development is described {{on the basis of}} local challenges framed in the theory of human and social capital. The educational model of <b>study</b> <b>circles,</b> well developed in Slovenia, is implemented. New dimensions development and empirical data are provided by the EU project. Monitoring evidence stimulated educational demands of the local community on various levels of activity (training programmes for mentors, <b>study</b> <b>circles,</b> stakeholders round tables) {{and at the same time}} stimulated offers as well. The project described demonstrates the possibility of building a local system of <b>study</b> <b>circles</b> linked to local development in the border area via a multi-level approach and the direct involvement of the various stakeholders. The final discussion highlights the importance of vertical and horizontal integration, typical for long-term bottom-up development. The diversity of learning devices and the role of the intermediary level provide a greater degree of creativity and initiative than the formal educational system, but only when it is recognised and empowered by top-down decision making...|$|R
