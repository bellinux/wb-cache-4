Interleaver design can allow the IDMA system to approach near <b>Shannon</b> <b>limits</b> of channel capacity. Interleaver combats against Intersymbol Interference (ISI), channel fading and all sorts of noises. In addition, interleavers provide security to the system users.

40|$|Abstract — The error-correcting {{performance}} of low-density parity check (LDPC) codes, when decoded using practical iterative decoding algorithms, {{is known to}} be very close to <b>Shannon</b> <b>limits</b> in the asymptotic limit of large blocklengths. A substantial limitation to the use of finite-length LDPC codes is the presence of an error floor in the low frame error rate (FER) region. This paper develops two methods, a stochastic one based on importance sampling and a deterministic one based on high SNR asymptotics, as applied to suitably defined absorbing structures within the LDPC code, to predict error floors. Our results are in very close agreement with hardware-based experimental results, and moreover extend the prediction of the error probability to as low as 10 − 30. Our deterministic estimates are guaranteed to be a lower bound to the error probability in the high SNR regime. I...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{construction}} method of non-binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) convolutional codes. Our construction method {{is an extension of}} Felstroem and Zigangirov construction for non-binary LDPC convolutional codes. The rate-compatibility of the non-binary convolutional code is also discussed. The proposed rate-compatible code is designed from one single mother (2, 4) -regular non-binary LDPC convolutional code of rate 1 / 2. Higher-rate codes are produced by puncturing the mother code and lower-rate codes are produced by multiplicatively repeating the mother code. Simulation results show that non-binary LDPC convolutional codes of rate 1 / 2 outperform state-of-the-art binary LDPC convolutional codes with comparable constraint bit length. Also the derived low-rate and high-rate non-binary LDPC convolutional codes exhibit good decoding performance without loss of large gap to the <b>Shannon</b> <b>limits.</b> Comment: 8 pages, submitted to IEICE transactio...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present regular bilayer LDPC {{convolutional}} codes for half-duplex relay channels. For the binary erasure relay channel, we {{prove that the}} proposed code construction achieves the capacities for the source-relay link and the source-destination link provided that the channel conditions are known when designing the code. Meanwhile, this code enables the highest transmission rate with decode-and-forward relaying. In addition, its regular degree distributions can easily be computed from the channel parameters, which significantly simplifies the code optimization. Numerical results are provided for both binary erasure channels (BEC) and AWGN channels. In BECs, we can observe that the gaps between the decoding thresholds and the <b>Shannon</b> <b>limits</b> are impressively small. In AWGN channels, the bilayer LDPC convolutional code clearly outperforms its block code counterpart in terms of bit error rate. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ISIT 201...|$|R

Separable, circulant-based (SCB) codes represent a general family of high-performance, hardware-friendly LDPC codes built out of circulants. A recently proposed technique applies row selection and column elimination methods to SCB codes to dramatically decrease error floors by avoiding certain small dominant absorbing sets in a principled way. This paper focuses on improving the greedy column elimination method to achieve greater flexibility in code rate while provably avoiding small dominant absorbing sets. Flexibility and low implementation complexity are therefore possible without sacrificing SCB code performance. I...|$|R
