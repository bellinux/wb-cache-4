50|$|On 1 January 2010, a 28-year-old Somali Muslim {{intruder}} {{armed with}} an axe and knife entered Westergaard's house and was subsequently shot and wounded by police. Westergaard was unharmed due to security precautions in his house. He escaped to a panic room {{when he saw}} the intruder standing in the hallway wielding an axe. Westergaard was separated from his five-year-old granddaughter who he left behind <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room just meters away from the intruder.|$|E

All the while she is talking, the girl is trying to pry open the trunk, apparently not knowing what's inside. She manages to get it open and out pops Willy Gardner, clean-cut, well-dressed and this girl's wish comes true...|$|E
5000|$|Harrington's {{response}} to {{criticism of the}} graphic images includes the following: [...] People may say they are too graphic, or that they aren't real, but this is undisputed photographic evidence that abortion is an act that kills a baby [...] [...] [...] Very few people will say, 'That's real. That's a baby. I'm still pro-choice,' [...] [...] [...] Instead, they will do {{all they can to}} discredit the argument and ignore that there's a white elephant <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room that cannot be ignored.|$|E
5000|$|The TV cuts to a {{scene of}} a {{reporter}} talking about how [...] "America has been hijacked" [...] and pictures of George W. Bush and Dick Chaney flashing across the screen (a reference to the song No W). The video shows <b>the</b> family <b>sitting</b> together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room, going on about their daily lives. Another explosion occurs with Jourgensen walking by outside. As the family takes cover, the boy {{from the beginning of}} the video (now a man) decides to take action and enlists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Army. The video ends with the young boy/man marching away with the same Army shown at the beginning.|$|R
500|$|Erica Sheen and Annette Davison, <b>in</b> {{their book}} <b>The</b> Cinema of David Lynch: American Dreams, Nightmare Visions, have drawn {{attention}} {{to the use of}} mise en scène early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode. A scene featuring Ferguson, Leland and Sarah Palmer <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Palmers' <b>living</b> room pans across the family's [...] "bric-à-brac". This technique draws {{attention to the}} painting with which Ferguson will be assaulted, and it highlights the similarity between Ferguson and Palmer by focusing on [...] "the famous homecoming queen shot" [...] of Palmer while Ferguson's face is visible. Sheen and Davison argued that the scene highlights the [...] "emotional claustrophobia" [...] felt by Ferguson, and that the set surrounding her was deliberately assembled to create this feeling.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> foyer, {{she runs}} into Sophia, and finds her now {{conscious}} father wrapped <b>in</b> plastic, <b>sitting</b> up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room. Sophia gives Sarah {{a key to}} a box containing pedophilic pictures of Sarah as a little girl, implying that her father sexually abused and photographed her. It is suggested that her recent interactions and hallucinations with the little girl and mystery attacker have {{been a kind of}} traumatic repressed memory. Events at the house have caused this memory to reappear, and Sarah is now exacting her revenge, although she has been confusing the difference between the events that are in her subconscious from her childhood and what she is actually doing now.|$|R

Hassan, who is <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room, starts looking at his wife's picture and starts to {{think of all the}} things that have happened. Hassan realises, even though it was hard to do, that the best course of action is to call the police. After contemplating a few times, Hassan picks up the phone and calls the police.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> epilogue, {{some time}} has passed and Andy and Helen are <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Taylor <b>living</b> room holding hands, {{drinking}} coffee, and commenting on Helen's experience as an author. Andy believes Mr. Bryant is probably working diligently to make Helen's book a bestseller. Helen says she's glad her part is over because she's exhausted. Bee comes downstairs with a large manila envelope and prepares to leave the house. Andy asks if she's written a book and, with some apologetic hesitation, Bee admits it's nothing but a collection of her recipes. Bee leaves for the post office. Opie enters. He's also writing a book, What It's Like to Be the Son of a Sheriff. Helen smiles and thinks Andy {{is going to have}} to get a typewriter, too.|$|R
5000|$|Melanie {{attempts}} {{to break the}} girl's friendship by sending Tracy {{to live with her}} father but he refuses. Meanwhile, Melanie goes over to Brooke's house, with Tracy and Evie, to find out what is going on, because she's been calling Brooke for two weeks. They find that Brooke was hiding because of bad plastic surgery she received. Evie asks Melanie to formally adopt her but Melanie refuses. Tracy meekly supports her mother's decision. Angry and hurt, a tearful Evie storms off. At school, Evie turns all her friends against Tracy and, depressed, Tracy slowly begins to realize the negative effects of her lifestyle when she is told she might have to repeat the seventh grade. To her surprise, Brady finds her walking home from school and takes her home where Melanie, Evie, and Brooke are <b>sitting</b> quietly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room waiting for her.|$|R
60|$|They were <b>sitting</b> {{together}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dim <b>living</b> room {{of their}} quaint old cottage {{down by the}} shore. The window was open and <b>the</b> sea-breeze blew <b>in,</b> stirring <b>the</b> prim white curtains fitfully, and ruffling the little rings of dark hair on Mary Isabel's forehead--rings which always annoyed Louisa. She thought Mary Isabel ought to brush them straight back, and Mary Isabel did so faithfully a dozen times a day; and in ten minutes they crept down again, kinking defiance to Louisa, who might make Mary Isabel submit to her in all things but had no power over naturally curly hair. Louisa had never had any trouble with her own hair; it was straight and sleek and mouse-coloured--what there was of it.|$|R
50|$|Mrs. Dallas would {{occasionally}} {{show up for}} unexpected visits with her son Steve. She was horrified at his slovenly, womanizing ways, and always tried to convince him {{to get married and}} go to church. She appeared as a heavy-set, aproned, fifties-style housewife, except that she also wore Steve's signature black aviator sunglasses. Mrs. Dallas apparently thought Steve's father had died, and had accordingly felt free to remarry five times. Steve eventually revealed that his father had actually been <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room, reading the paper, the entire time. She did not care for Opus, whom she originally thought to be a large rodent. Opus never realized she was referring to him. She also has appeared several times as a manifestation out of Steve's anxiety closet.|$|E
50|$|Eventually Mary has her child, a son Sean. One night Thomas (whom Mary recognizes immediately, {{due to his}} glasses) enters {{her home}} with other IRA members and tells her that Daniel, who is <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room, {{is the one who}} {{reported}} John to the authorities. Daniel argues that he would never do such a thing, but despite support from Mary and Bernadette, is still taken outside and kneecapped ("If This Is What We're Fighting For"). Eventually John is released from prison, but has been radicalized and wants to go to England on an IRA mission. After John gives her his football jersey for their son, Mary gives John a copy of the team photograph telling him that before he goes to England to remember that his true self was his first victim.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the last}} episode's {{penultimate}} and final scenes, Donald Westphall — having just returned to St. Eligius — {{is shown in}} Dr. Auschlander's office pondering the recent death from stroke of his colleague and mentor. With the aria [...] "Chi il bel sogno di Doretta" [...] (Doretta's Beautiful Dream) from Puccini's opera La Rondine playing, Tommy Westphall enters the office and runs to the window, where {{he looks at the}} snow falling outside St. Eligius. An exterior camera shot of the hospital cuts to Tommy Westphall <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room of an apartment building alongside his grandfather, now being portrayed by Norman Lloyd (aka [...] "Daniel Auschlander").

5000|$|I got two dogs, Niggy, {{the little}} black one, and Peewee, a brown one, that's bigger. Me and my wife were <b>sitting</b> here <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room. We heard the dogs get awful restless. My front light was on and Larry Moore ... had his back light on. I glanced {{out the window and}} saw this thing. It had me plumb spellbound. It was bout 20 inches high. It had a long tail, about 14 inches. The color of it was dark. It had a face exactly like a cat. Only I ain't ever seen a cat that big. It was walking around stealthy, sneaky, moving about trying to get to Niggy and Peewee. I jumped for my shotgun and loaded it and went out to shoot it, but it moved into the {{darkness}} right away and I couldn't find him again. [...] A group of hunters from Wilmington including S. W. Garret, G. V. Garret, and Joe Gore spent that night tracking the creature for three miles around swampland. According to them, the tracks showed claws at least an inch long and indicated an 80 lb. to 90 lb. animal. The beast's circling movement suggested it might have had offspring or a mate nearby, the hunters said.|$|R
50|$|The play {{begins with}} Lucy, a four-year-old girl, <b>sitting</b> by herself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room, {{playing with a}} Ken and Barbie. Mr Marmalade appears and the two begin to play tea. Mr Marmalade asks Lucy if she's angry with him, who says she just wishes he wasn't too busy. Sookie, Lucy's mother, {{interrupts}} the tea party and asks Lucy which dress she should wear. Mr Marmalade, who Sookie cannot see, suggests the red one. Sookie leaves and Mr M and Lucy return to their conversation. Mr M tells Lucy he will take her to Mexico, to Cabo San Lucas. Their happiness is put at an end when Mr Marmalade is {{sent back to the}} office, leaving Lucy alone again. Sookie then re-enters and tells Lucy that the babysitter, Emily, will be there in half an hour. Sookie then leaves, leaving Lucy alone once more.|$|R

Mrs Doyle then enters, looking disdainful of Polly's presence and less than polite towards her as she leads her to the spare room. Dougal, meanwhile, has been behind a chair, hiding from [...] "your woman" [...] because he wouldn't {{know what to say to}} her. As Ted begins telling Dougal about Polly, a scream is heard from upstairs; Father Jack is in the spare room bed and is unprepared to move (Ted receives another punch in the nose for trying to move Jack). After they use a [...] "calming" [...] blue card to get Jack out of the room, Mrs Doyle tells Polly to have a lovely stay.|$|E
50|$|The three {{go on the}} run, {{trying to}} escape it. Their goal is to {{discover}} what happened to Dan and his family. There was no clue of where they went in the tapes, however Charlie's informant manages {{to tell him that}} Dan used his money to purchase a home in a new location. The three travel to this spot, and find the house has been burnt down. They locate a storm shelter with electricity and a working camera feed which apparently caught everything going on in the house. They find out that Dan smothered his daughter Tara (Morgan Bastin) and then attempted to choke his wife Rose (Alexandra Holden) to death in a stupor. However, Rose survived Dan's attempt to kill her, and pushed him down a staircase. Dan fell to his death on the stairs, and Rose, clearly stricken with grief, grabbed a red can filled with some kind of fuel, and proceeded to burn the house down, while <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room clutching her daughter's stuffed rabbit.|$|E
50|$|Luc is {{surprised}} when his 16-year-son Lowie is <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room. Many years ago, {{after the divorce}} with his wife Leontien, Lowie was taken abroad. Leontien died and the juvenile court decided Lowie {{had to return to}} his father. Lowie soon starts a relationship with Jana. Jana visits the doctor who confirms she has been pregnant for at least three months, which means Bram is the father. Franky uses Facebook {{to get in touch with}} Bram, although Jana forbids him to do. Next day, Bram returns from Ibiza, which displeases Jana, Lowie and Tibo. At the end, Jana chooses Bram as she thinks her relationship with Lowie will not stand as he is not the father. Lowie is upset and blames Franky as he contacted Bram. Lowie goes to Frens and sneakily mixes whiskey and cognac in his soda drinks. Lowie is taken into hospital after binge drinking. Lowie claims Franky gave him the drinks although Luc already found out the bottles were taken from his private collection. Nevertheless, Luc also claims the pub served spiritual drinks to underage persons. Franky and Jens only get a small administrative penalty as there is not enough proof.|$|E

5000|$|Erik Turner stated, [...] "You {{can hear}} {{and feel the}} {{emotions}} of the last 25 + years of being in this band poured into LHF. The fun and the frustrations, the pleasure and the pain... {{a whole lot of}} blood, sweat, tears and beers went into the making of this album. Love it or hate it, its the real deal, 100% pure melodic hard rock. Hand crafted by five musicians who dedicated their lives to music when they were just little kids with big dreams."Jerry Dixon adds, [...] " [...] 'Louder Harder Faster' is truly one of our best records to date. It has all the classic Warrant ingredients that people have come to know, plus a lot of extras that keep it in the modern realm of todays music. It's a perfect mix between Balls and Ballads. When we started this project over two years ago, we wanted to bring the listener {{back to the days of}} <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room and cranking up a record from start to finish.

5000|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{released}} on May 28, 2011 and shows {{the story of a}} girl who is passionate about her best friend's brother, and who dreams of having a chance to be alone with him. As the song describes him, the boy is six-foot and three inches tall, and is the drummer of a punk rock band. He is muscular, tan skinned, raven haired, and wears black leather vests over white t shirts. In {{the first part of the}} video, we see Victoria and her best friend apparently studying in her friend's bedroom. Victoria leaves to fetch a glass of water in the kitchen, passing her best friend's brother, played by actor/model Daniel Romer who is <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room. Once in the kitchen, she begins to [...] "daydream" [...] and imagines herself sliding into the living room with her socks on the hardwood floor. Victoria is now wearing an oversized oxford shirt and hot pants in an homage to the Tom Cruise film Risky Business as she swings her hair, dances, and sings to the enthusiastic boy. In the second sequence we see Victoria parked outside of the house, text messaging her friend to tell her she has arrived. She then catches a glimpse of the boy's bandmates leaving his garage. The next moment, she has another dream in which she sings on top of the car on the street and he plays drums. The climax of the video takes place in a pizzeria, where Victoria dances to the chorus of the song, when her crush walks up to her and holds her hands, confessing his feelings for her.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Helen {{receives}} a package from a delivery man named Orlando (Moore). Helen scolds {{him for what}} seems as though trying to flirt with her. Madea then recognizes Orlando in a magazine as a successful and wealthy business owner. Helen apologizes to Orlando, but Orlando blocks her advance, claiming that she is only doing so because she {{found out that he}} was rich. Helen finally tells him of her troubles and the two become friends from there on out. Brenda returns once more, this time bringing the paralyzed Charles to Helen, claiming that she can't take care of him anymore and that she's not a care giver. Brenda then leaves quickly as Helen was trying to pull her wig off, like she did when Myrtle told her about Charles, but not before being shot by Madea, who exclaims, [...] "I got her, girl. Let me get the hell out!" [...] Helen talks to Charles and laughs at {{the fact that he is}} now suffering. She leaves him <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> room for days without feeding and bathing him. Charles begins to apologize and begs to just be left to die, but Helen refuses and tells him that she wants him to suffer for everything that he did to her. Later, Madea, who has been captured by the police later in the play for attempted murder, and Daddy Charles, who was sent to a home, work together and deliver letters from Charles job to Helen and make her see that she is now the acting owner of the company and quickly fires someone over the phone (likely Brenda).|$|E
