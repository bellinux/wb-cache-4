5|$|Built to Brigham Young's design, the handcarts {{resembled a}} large wheelbarrow, with two wheels five feet (1.5m) in {{diameter}} and a <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> {{four and a half}} feet (1.4m) wide, and weighing 60 pounds (27kg). Running along each side of the bed were seven-foot (2.1 m) pull shafts ending with a three-foot (0.9m) crossbar at the front. The crossbar allowed the carts to be pushed or pulled. Cargo was carried in a box about three feet by four feet (0.9m by 1.2m), with 8inch (0.2m) walls. The handcarts generally carried up to 250 pounds (110kg) of supplies and luggage, though they were capable of handling loads as heavy as 500 pounds (230kg). Carts used in the first year's migration were made entirely of wood ("Iowa hickory or oak"); in later years a stronger design was substituted, which included metal elements.|$|E

50|$|The {{running gear}} {{of a modern}} railway vehicle comprises, in most instances, a bogie frame with two wheelsets. However there are also wagons with <b>single</b> <b>axles</b> (fixed or movable) and even {{individual}} wheels.|$|R
25|$|The DP.VII's mainwheels were {{mounted on}} a <b>single</b> <b>axle,</b> {{conventionally}} rubber sprung to a cross member attached to the lower fuselage longerons by a V-form pair of struts on each side. Less conventionally, the undercarriage structure was braced by another, transverse, V-strut from the cross piece centre to the longerons. There was a sprung tail skid at the rear.|$|E
25|$|The Kolibri's tail was conventional, with a {{trapezoidal}} plan tailplane and elevators {{mounted on}} top of the fuselage and with a quadrantal fin and a rounded rudder that reached down to the keel. It had a very simple, fixed, tailskid undercarriage with the mainwheels on a short <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> held just below the fuselage underside, making the track narrow.|$|E
25|$|The RK.25 had a {{traditional}} fixed undercarriage with a track of , its mainwheels on a <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> {{supported by a}} pair of V-struts from the lower fuselage. The tops of the forward V-strut members were joined transversely by a beam, free to slide vertically between pairs of fuselage members but restrained by sets of rubber rings which also circled the wing structure as it crossed the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|The C.37 had a fixed {{tailskid}} undercarriage. There were {{pairs of}} main wheels mounted on <b>single</b> <b>axles</b> attached at their centre to a longitudinal bar held under the engine {{at each end}} on short, forward raked V-struts. To prevent nose-overs, there was a fifth wheel mounted under the nose.|$|R

25|$|The pilot's open cockpit {{was under}} the wing cut-out; the {{observer}} sat close behind in a cockpit equipped with twin machine guns on a Scarff ring type mounting. The fin of the C.101 was triangular and broad chord and the rudder had a straight, vertical edge which extended down to the keel. As the rectangular plan tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage, the balanced, overhung elevators had a cut-out for rudder movement. The C.101 had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, with its mainwheels on a <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> which was sprung from V-form struts.|$|E
25|$|As {{locomotive}} types {{began to}} diverge {{in the late}} 19th century, freight engine designs at first emphasised tractive effort, whereas those for passenger engines emphasised speed. Over time, freight locomotive size increased, and {{the overall number of}} axles increased accordingly; the leading bogie was usually a <b>single</b> <b>axle,</b> but a trailing truck was added to larger locomotives to support a larger firebox that could no longer fit between or above the driving wheels. Passenger locomotives had leading bogies with two axles, fewer driving axles, and very large driving wheels in order to limit the speed at which the reciprocating parts had to move.|$|E
25|$|They {{are usually}} 8-car {{articulated}} units (DSB class SA-SB-SC-SD-SD-SC-SB-SA, {{also known as}} Litra SA) supplied by Alstom-LHB and Siemens with prefabricated friction stir welded aluminium roof panels made by Marine Aluminium from Sapa extrusions, and were manufactured from 1996 to 2007. The cars are shorter than conventional railway cars; each has a <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> under one end, the other end being supported by the neighbouring car. (The end cars have two axles each). They have automatic Scharfenberg couplers at the ends; in peak hours most trains consist of two coupled units, giving a total train length of 168 meters. They have video surveillance to ensure passenger and staff security and to prevent acts of vandalism. These trains introduced air conditioning in the interior and regenerative braking to the network, increasing energy efficiency. At present, there are 105 8-car trains (840 cars).|$|E

25|$|The G.I had unstaggered unequal span wings, {{straight}} edged and {{of constant}} chord and with three bays per side defined by parallel interplane struts. Its fuselage was flat sided with a rounded nose whose profile containing the gunner's position. the pilot's cockpit was immediately behind the gunner but {{ahead of the}} wing leading edge. The Maybach Mb.IVa water-cooled six cylinder inline engine was directly behind the pilot driving two propellers placed on outriggers in the inner bays. The fuselage was tapered toward the tail, where a broad chord, triangular fin carried a rectangular rudder that extended below the fuselage. The undercarriage was conventional, with wheels on a <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> mounted {{on a pair of}} V-struts to the fuselage. There was also a tail skid and a pair of smaller wheels mounted under the nose to avoid nose-overs.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} the {{locomotive}} is roughly proportional to the power output; {{the number of axles}} required is determined by this weight divided by the axleload limit for the trackage where the locomotive is to be used. The number of driving wheels is derived from the adhesive weight in the same manner, leaving the remaining axles to be accounted for by the leading and trailing bogies. Passenger locomotives conventionally had two-axle leading bogies for better guidance at speed; on the other hand, the vast increase {{in the size of the}} grate and firebox in the 20th century meant that a trailing bogie was called upon to provide support. In Europe, some use was made of several variants of the Bissel bogie in which the swivelling movement of a <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> truck controls the lateral displacement of the front driving axle (and in one case the second axle too). This was mostly applied to 8-coupled express and mixed traffic locomotives, and considerably improved their ability to negotiate curves whilst restricting overall locomotive wheelbase and maximising adhesion weight.|$|E
25|$|A {{major problem}} left to solve {{was that the}} new {{autorack}} cars did not provide any protection from theft, vandalism, or from severe weather. Individual railroads began installing mesh side screens and solid panels to their racks to protect the vehicles from impact and debris in the late 1960s, and by the early 1970s new racks were being delivered with these side panels. However, thieves and vagrants could still {{gain access to the}} automobiles. In 1973 the first fully enclosed racks with continuous side panels, end doors, and roofs were developed to address this problem. Whitehead & Kales, Ford, N and DT jointly developed a Snap-Pak prototype enclosed tri-level car, NW 400000. The car side was made up of overlapping perforated steel sheets. The ends were protected with two trifold doors, and a corrugated steel roof extended the full length of the car. A competing RailPac prototype was developed by Portec-Paragon, Chrysler, and several railroads. It featured mesh screen side panels, vertically sliding three-piece doors, and a similar roof. The Southern Railway and Greenville Steel Car developed a unique 124-foot articulated three-unit Autoguard car with <b>single</b> <b>axle</b> trucks, SOU 599000-599001.|$|E
2500|$|Behind {{the wings}} the {{fuselage}} tapered gently to a broad, triangular fin which carried a vertical edged balanced rudder that {{reached down to}} the keel. The tailplane [...] was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage so its elevators had a notch for rudder movement. The C.37 had a fixed tailskid undercarriage. There were pairs of main wheels mounted on <b>single</b> <b>axles</b> attached at their centre to a longitudinal bar held under the engine at each end on short, forward raked V-struts.|$|R
50|$|The C.43 had a fixed {{tailskid}} undercarriage. There were {{pairs of}} mainwheels mounted on <b>single</b> <b>axles</b> {{attached to a}} longitudinal bar held under the engine on short V-struts. To prevent nose-overs, there was a fifth wheel mounted under the nose. The wheels could be replaced by flat sided floats, each fixed to the fuselage by two pairs of inverted V-struts, one to {{each side of the}} float. Though in floatplane configuration the C.43 sat level over the water, the tailskid was joined by a small, cylindrical float to protect the tail at take-off.|$|R

500|$|The {{weight and}} size of CMVs are {{restricted}} for practical and safety reasons. CMVs are restricted by gross weight (total weight of vehicle and cargo), and by axle weight (i.e., the weight carried by each tire). The federal weight limits for CMVs are [...] for gross weight (unless the bridge formula dictates a lower limit), [...] for a tandem axle, and [...] for a <b>single</b> <b>axle.</b> A tandem axle is defined as two or more consecutive axles whose centers are spaced more than [...] {{but not more than}} [...] apart. Axles spaced less than [...] apart are considered a <b>single</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
500|$|The rise in {{altitude}} {{to reach}} the mines was accomplished by a gravity worked incline, [...] long, on a gradient of 1 in 4 (25%). To achieve the constant gradient, formidable earthworks were necessary, and construction took four years with a Mr Gunn as the contractor. While {{this was going on}} mining had been proceeding apace and large stocks of ore were waiting at the incline head to be conveyed to the harbour. Ore was brought down the incline while it was being completed, from 31 May 1858, and it was not fully finished until March 1861, when two [...] diameter winding drums were installed on a <b>single</b> <b>axle,</b> located below the track, at Brendon Hill. Public goods traffic was accepted from 28 September 1859.|$|E
500|$|Each Iore {{consists}} of twin units with one driver's cab at each. They normally operate in fixed units of two, making a pair capable of hauling a [...] ore train. Technically an Iore section is also capable {{to operate as}} single locomotive, an option that is seldom used in operation. The units are fed with [...] via a pantograph. The power is transformed and then converted via a single water-cooled gate turn-off (GTO) thyristor based converter per bogie. The converters belong to the Camilla family, which was developed by ABB's Swiss branch as successor for its oil-cooled converters, and found previous use in the FS Class E464. The converters operate independently, with their own cooling and control systems and are shut down automatically in case of failure. The converters consist of seven line-replaceable unit modules to minimize maintenance costs. Each locomotive has six three-phase asynchronous alternating current traction motors, each rated at [...] and each powering a <b>single</b> <b>axle.</b> This gives a Co′Co′ wheel arrangement. The tractive effort of each locomotive is [...] and the maximum dynamic braking effort is [...] There is also a boost function, allowing a temporary traction effort of [...] The units are capable of [...] in single runs, [...] with empty trains and [...] with loaded trains.|$|E
50|$|The chassis is a {{full-length}} backbone tube with independent swing half axles in 4x4, 6x6 and 8x8. 4x4 models had front axle suspension via adjustable torsion bars, 6x6 and 8x8 models {{front and rear}} axles used longitudinal semi-elliptic leaf springs. For 4x4 configuration the rear axle was suspended via air suspension. Full-time all-wheel-drive front twin steer (6x6, 8x8) drive via homo-kinetic drive shafts, drive with the differential locks, inter-axle differentials with locks and planetary hub reductions on all models. Unlike many six-wheeled vehicles, which have a <b>single</b> front <b>axle</b> and tandem rear axles, 6x6 versions used twin steering front axles- as with the 8x8- and a <b>single</b> rear <b>axle.</b>|$|R
50|$|All {{of these}} railcars had a <b>single</b> powered <b>axle</b> (1A-A1 wheel arrangement). Those built in 1930 used a 12V generator, but all {{subsequent}} ones used 24V, after Sentetsu opted to standardise with the L3-type 24V, 900W axle-mounted generator.|$|R

5000|$|Chassis weights were increased, {{front axle}} GAWRs were {{available}} up to 20,000 lb, <b>single</b> rear <b>axles</b> to 23,000 lb as before, and tandem rear axles to 46,000 lb. On tandems a walking beam type was standard and 2 different air suspensions were available.|$|R
25|$|During {{the first}} {{thirteen}} {{years of his}} tenure at the Great Eastern Railway Holden's locomotive designs did not utilise bogies. His predecessors had vacillated between 0-4-4 and 2-4-2 tanks for suburban and branch services, and between both 2-2-2 and 4-2-2, and 2-4-0 and 4-4-0 tender types for express passenger service, but Holden's designs had <b>single</b> <b>axles</b> with side-play rather than a leading or trailing bogie. At {{the beginning of his}} tenure the GER possessed some 75 bogie single or four-coupled engines, {{but by the end of}} 1897 their number had dwindled to twelve. Then, just as the bogie appeared to be doomed to extinction on the GER, Holden introduced over the next three years new 4-2-2 and 4-4-0 passenger and 0-4-4 tank classes.|$|R
