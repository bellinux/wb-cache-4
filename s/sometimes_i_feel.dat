5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{returned}} to baseball in 1995, {{and spent the}} season with the Rookie-level Gulf Coast Yankees. When he {{returned to}} the game, after surgery, he had lost 8mph off his fastball and was unable to throw a curveball for a strike. As a result, in his first season back, he had two wins, five losses, a 6.08 ERA, and 54 walks in 40 innings pitched. The Yankees planned to have Taylor spend the 1996 season with the Double-A Norwich Navigators, but he continued to struggle with his control in spring training, saying at one point, [...] "Sometimes I get the ball across the plate, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like I've never held a ball in my life". He instead spent the year with the Single-A Greensboro Bats and walked 43 batters in 16.1 innings, going 05 with an 18.73 ERA in nine games; the Yankees removed him from their 40-man roster as a result.|$|E

500|$|On the reveal, Dohring {{said in an}} interview: [...] "I’m {{actually}} glad, Rob told {{us about}} episode six or seven that we would get together. We were like, ‘No way!’ But there was something going on there. We could feel it as actors. It was damn cool – these characters {{had some kind of}} connection. So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but <b>sometimes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene.

2500|$|Other {{works such}} as I've Got It All (2000) show Emin with her [...] "legs splayed on a red floor, {{clutching}} banknotes and coins to her crotch. Made {{at a time of}} public and financial success, the image connects the artist's desire for money and success and her sexual desire (her role as consumer) with her use of her body and her emotional life to produce her art (the object of consumption)", while <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> Beautiful (2000) pictures Emin lying alone in a bath. Both these works are examples of her using [...] "large-scale photographs of herself to record and express moments of emotional significance in her life, frequently making reference to her career as an artist. The photographs have a staged quality, as though the artist is enacting a private ritual." ...|$|E
2500|$|Emin {{displayed}} six small watercolours in her Turner Prize {{exhibition in}} 1999, {{and also in}} her New York show Every Part of Me's Bleeding held that same year, known as the Berlin Watercolour series (1998). These delicate, washed out but colourful watercolours include four portraits of Emin's face and were all painted by Emin in Berlin during 1998, adapted from Polaroids of the artist taking a bath. Each unique painting from this series share the same title, Berlin The Last Week in April 1998. Simon Wilson, spokesperson for the Tate, commented that Emin included the set of tiny Berlin watercolours [...] "as a riposte to the accusation {{that there are no}} paintings" [...] in the Turner Prize exhibitions. [...] The bath theme seen in these watercolours was later revisited by Emin in her photographic work <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> Beautiful (2000) and in monoprints such as the Bath White (2005) series. With all these works, Emin explores a Mary Cassatt quality of the [...] "woman in a private moment".|$|E
2500|$|Emin {{frequently}} {{works with}} fabric {{in the form}} of appliqués – material (often cut out into lettering) sewn onto other material. She collects fabric from curtains, bed sheets and linen and has done so for most of her life. She keeps such material that holds emotional significance for later use in her work. Many of her large-scale appliqués are made on hotel linens, for example, It Always Hurts (2005), <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> So Fucking Lost (2005), Volcano Closed (2001) and Helter Fucking Skelter (2001). Hate And Power Can Be A Terrible Thing (2004), part of the Tate's collection of Emin's work, is a large-scale blanket inspired in part by Margaret Thatcher due to her involvement in [...] "an attack on 800 boys and men in the Argentinian navy" [...] and other women for example women who steals their friends' boyfriends, Emin says of this work [...] "about the kind of women I hate, the kind of women I have no respect for, women who betray and destroy the hearts of other women".|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, Wilson intimated: [...] "Once you've {{been labeled}} as a genius, {{you have to}} {{continue}} it or your name becomes mud. I am {{a victim of the}} recording industry. I didn't think I was a genius. I thought I had talent. But I didn't think I was a genius." [...] Parks echoed that Taylor's line [...] "forced Brian Wilson to have to continuously prove that he's a genius and not just a lucky guy with a tremendous amount of talent {{and a lot of people}} collaborating beautifully around him." [...] To expand his creative conceptions, Wilson turned to drugs, which Love says ultimately became his undoing: [...] "It was hard enough to match the Beatles, but now he had to keep up with Mozart?". By 1967, Wilson said that he had run out of ideas [...] "in a conventional sense", and that he was [...] "about ready to die". After 1967's Wild Honey, he relinquished his creative hold on the Beach Boys. } From 1968 onward, his songwriting output declined substantially, but the public narrative of [...] "Brian-as-leader" [...] continued. Following the 1969 termination of their contract to Capitol Records, the band's new contract with Reprise stipulated Brian's proactive involvement with the band in all albums. Producer Terry Melcher remembered how in one recording session from 1975, Wilson refused to go near the mixing board: [...] "He knows his reputation, so he makes a lot of unfinished records; <b>sometimes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that he feels that he's peaked and does not want to put his stamp on records so that peers will have a Brian Wilson track to criticize." ...|$|E
