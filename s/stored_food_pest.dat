These include cereals, pulses, dried seeds and root crops. Insect infestation is {{a major contributor to}} quality deterioration of stored products kept in warm and humid climates. Considerable physical and nutritional loss sustained are due to infestation of <b>stored</b> <b>food</b> products by weevils, bruchids and other insects. Apart from the detrimental economic impact, these losses pose a major threat to food security. Traditional methods of applying spices, medicinal plants and their extractives, and inert materials with pest control potential as storage protectants, have increasingly been explored and exploited in the developing world as alternatives for the control of pests of stored products. In addition to insects, several other organisms attack stored products. These include microorganisms (mainly fungi and bacteria, which cause infection and deterioration), mites, rodents and birds. Plants and plant products can affect insects and other storage pests in various ways by exhibiting pest control activities as toxicants, attractants, repellents, antifeedants and growth regulators; they are also effective as antimicrobials and antifungals. Several kinds of materials are used as a means of <b>stored</b> <b>food</b> protection, including chemical fumigation, treatment with synthetic pesticides, and inert materials. This paper will review research relevant to the application of botanical pesticides, particularly those derived from spices and medicinal plants, and also inert materials, which are traditionally applied to control <b>stored</b> <b>food</b> <b>pests</b> in Thailand...|$|R
40|$|The Coleoptera Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Curculionidae) and Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Steph.) (Laemophloeidae) {{are among}} the most {{important}} primary pests of all types of grain, pasta, flour, legumes, and tobacco. Essential oils, extracted from aromatic plants, due to their repellent properties and very low toxicity to mammalians, could represent a valid, alternative to chemical repellents for the protection of stored foodstuff. In this study, the essential oil extracted from Juniperus macrocarpa Sm. (Cupressaceae) (JEO), native of Mediterranean sand dune habitat, was chemically analyzed and its repellent activity against S. oryzae and C. ferrugineus was evaluated by the Area Preference Method. The results showed that JEO was constituted mainly by mono and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. JEO major chemical was α-pinene, repeatedly reported as a very effective repellent against <b>stored</b> <b>food</b> insect <b>pests.</b> The bioassays indicated that JEO exerts a good repellency against S. oryzae and C. ferrugineus. Interestingly, C. ferrugineus is about 15 times more susceptible to JEO than S. oryzae. The obtained results showed that JEO could represents an effective, broad-spectrum bio-repellent to be used as sustainable alternative to synthetic insect repellents to fight the losses caused to <b>stored</b> <b>food</b> by insect <b>pests...</b>|$|R

Here, we report a 19 year old male who attempted suicide with one tablet of AlP and demonstrated severe hypoglycemia. Despite restoration of blood glucose concentration to normal, he failed to respond to supportive treatment and died. The possible mechanisms leading to severe hypoglycemia are discussed. Though severe hypoglycemia is rare following AlP poisoning, physicians managing such patients should be aware of it...|$|R

Neirl (Cupressaceae) is a {{dioecious}} evergreen shrub species, {{native of}} the Mediterranean region whose extracts, {{from different parts of}} the plant, have been used since ancient times for fragrance, flavoring, medicinal, antibacterial, insecticidal, and cosmetic purposes (1). J. oxycedrus subsp. macrocarpa is distributed from southwestern Spain to Middle East coasts (2). In Italy it is present almost in the entire peninsula including islands where it is characteristic of the consolidated coastal dunes (Habitat 2250 *: Coastal dunes with Juniperus spp.). The rust-red grain beetle, Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Steph.) (Coleoptera Laemophloeidae), is the smallest of the grain beetles (1. 5 - 2 mm), reddish-brown, flat and slender in the in the appearance. It is a worldwidediffused secondary pest that attacks grains, grain products and a multitude of dried vegetables and fruits. Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera Curculionidae) also called lesser rice weevil, is a small (2. 5 - 4 mm), dark brown species with 4 distinct reddish patches on the elytra. S. oryzae {{is one of the most}} important pests of grains, pasta, flour, legumes, baked goods and even tobacco (3). Both species are therefore considered among the most harmful to the <b>stored</b> <b>food</b> causing huge losses wordwide. For these reasons, eco-friendly strategies to prevent such insect attacks to the stored and/or final packaged products are therefore highly foreseen. Due to their repellent properties, essential oils, obtained from aromatic plants, could represent a valid, ecofriendly alternative to synthetic repellents. In this study, the J. oxicedrus subsp. macrocarpa essential oil (JEO) was prepared from leaves and seed cones collected, from individuals growing along the Northern coast of Tuscany (Italy) in the Migliarino, San Rossore, Massaciuccoli Natural Park. JEO chemical composition was assessed by gas chromatography (GC) and by gas chromatography/electron impact mass spectroscopy (GC-EIMS). The repellent activity of JEO, against C. ferrugineus and S. oryzae, was then evaluated, in vitro, by the Area Preference Method (4). The results showed that JEO is constituted mainly by mono and sesqui-terpene hydrocarbons and that is rich in chemical components such as α-pinene that has been shown to be very effective as repellents against <b>stored</b> <b>food</b> insect <b>pests</b> (4). Area preference bioassay indicated that JEO exerts a good repellency against S. oryzae and C. ferrugineus. Interestingly, according to probit analysis, C. ferrugineus is about 15 times more susceptible to JEO than S. oryzae. Since aromatic plants EOs present very low toxicity to mammalians and no significant risks to the environment, JEO could represents an interesting, sustainable alternative to synthetic insects repellents that could contribute to fight the losses caused to <b>stored</b> <b>food</b> by insect <b>pests...</b>|$|R
40|$|Carvacrol is {{an active}} {{ingredient}} of essential oils from different plants, mainly from oregano and thyme species. It poseses biocidal activity agains many artropodes of the importance for veterinary and human medicine. Carvacrol acts as repelent, larvicide, insecticide and acaricide. It acts against pest artropodes {{such as those that}} serve as mechanical or biological vectors for many causal agents of viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases for animals and humans. Therefore, it may be used not only in pest arthropodes control but in vector borne diseases control, too. In the paper carvacrol bioactivity against mosquitoes, house flies, cockroaches, ticks and mites are described. Potencial modes of carvacrol action on artropodes are given, too. Carvacrol reachs its biotoxicity against arthropodes alone or in combination with other active ingredients from the same plant of its origin, such as tymol, cymen or others. The paper explains reasons for frequently investigations on essential oils and other natural products of plant origin to their biotoxicity against <b>food</b> <b>stored</b> <b>pest</b> or pest of medicinal importance, as well as, needs for their use in agriculture, veterinary and human medicine...|$|R

2500|$|The American {{poet and}} travel author Bayard Taylor (1825–1878) was {{astonished}} {{when he discovered}} a Syrian hospital where cats roamed freely. The institution, in which domestic felines were sheltered and nourished, was funded by a waqf, along with caretakers' wages, veterinary care and cat food. Edward William Lane (1801–1876), British Orientalist who resided in Cairo, described a cat garden originally endowed by the 13th-century Egyptian sultan Baibars, whose European contemporaries held a very different attitude towards cats, eating them or killing them under papal decrees. Wilfred Thesiger, in his book [...] "The Marsh Arabs", notes that cats were allowed free entry to community buildings in villages in the Mesopotamian Marshes, and even fed, though dogs and other animals were driven out. Aside from protecting granaries and <b>food</b> <b>stores</b> from <b>pests,</b> cats were valued by the paper-based Arab-Islamic cultures for preying on mice that destroyed books. For that reason, cats are often depicted in paintings alongside Islamic scholars and bibliophiles. The medieval Egyptian zoologist Al-Damiri (1344–1405) wrote that the first cat was created when God caused a lion to sneeze, after animals on Noah's Ark complained of mice.|$|R
