40|$|How do {{financial}} {{development and}} financial integration interact? We focus on Japan’s Great Recession after 1990 {{to study this}} question. Regional differences in banking integration affected how the recession spread across the country: financing frictions for credit-dependent firms were more severe in less integrated prefectures, which saw larger decreases in lending by nationwide banks and lower GDP growth. We explain these cross-prefectural differences in banking integration by reference to prefectures’ different historical pathways to financial development. After Japan’s opening to trade in the 19 th century, silk reeling emerged as the main export industry. The silk reeling industry depended heavily on credit for working capital but comprised many small firms that could not borrow directly from larger banks. Instead, silk merchants in Yokohama, the main export hub for silk, provided silk reelers with trade loans. Many regional banks in Japan were founded as local clearing houses for such loans, and regional banks continued to account for above-average shares in lending in the formerly silk-exporting prefectures long after {{the decline of the}} silk industry. Using the cross-prefectural variation in the number of <b>silk</b> <b>filatures</b> in 1895 as an instrument, we confirm that the post- 1990 decline was worse in prefectures where credit constraints were tightened through low levels of banking integration. Our findings suggest that different pathways to financial development can lead to long-term differences in de facto financial integration, even if there are no formal barriers to capital mobility between regions, {{as is the case in}} modern Japan...|$|R

On laying open the trade, the article of raw silk was instantly enhanced to the Company full eighty per cent. The contract made for that commodity, wound off in the Bengal method, which used to sell for less than six rupees, or thirteen shillings, for two pounds' weight, arose to nine rupees, or near twenty shillings, and the <b>filature</b> <b>silk</b> was very soon after contracted for at fourteen.|$|R

50|$|Jardines were a major {{importer}} and {{exporter of}} {{all manner of}} goods prior to the 1937 Japanese invasion of China. Tea and silk ranked {{high on the list}} of commodities exported. As long ago as 1801, precursor firms to Jardines had secured the first licences from the East India Company to exports teas to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land and when the East India Company's trade monopoly was overturned in 1834, the firm lost no time in expanding its tea business. By the 1890s Jardines were exporting large quantities of Keemun. Soochong, Oolong, Gunpowder, and Chun Mee tea. Ocean steamers laden with these cargoes departed from Fuzhou and Taiwan, as well as from the firms godowns (warehouses) on the Shanghai Bund bound for Europe, Africa, and America. Silk played a prominent role as a commodity during Jardine's first century of operation. Before the Japanese invasion, the firm shipped from Japan to America, France, Switzerland, England, and elsewhere. For many years before war broke out in the late 1930s, the firm operated its own EWO <b>Silk</b> <b>Filature</b> or factory for producing the material.The firm also owned large warehouses in Shanghai, Tientsin, Tsingtao, Hankow, and Hong Kong, which provided access to the products of the cold north, such as wool, furs, soya beans, oils, and oilseeds and bristles as well as the produce of the vast agricultural centre, which included tung and other vegetable oils and oilseeds, egg products, bristles, and beans; and also the marketable yield of the sunny south, its tung oil, aniseed, cassia bark, and ginger. Hongkong and Shanghai were the main import and export centres while branch offices also engaged in these activities on a smaller scale dealing in products from timber to foodstuffs, from textiles to medicines, from metals to fertilizers, and from wines and spirits to cosmetics.|$|E
40|$|Increased {{awareness}} {{and concerns about}} the environment and pollution have paved way for Eco-friendly processes in chemical processing. Conventional soap- soda boiling method of degumming silk has many disadvantages coupled with the convenience of time. The enzymatic degumming processes have been attempted earlier and are gaining importance due to less degradation of silk, ease of process control, better hand properties of silk besides being environmental friendly process. An attempt is made to apply neutral-alkaline protease enzyme SerinzymeÒ for degumming of 4 -ply <b>filature</b> <b>silk</b> yarn and results are compared with the control soap-soda boil method. The degummed silk yarn is analysed for properties related to strength and weight loss. The enzymatic degummed silk yarn showed better control over the conventional process based on the dosage of enzyme and degumming loss. Tenacity and breaking force at 1 % and 2 % enzyme dosage was superior {{in comparison to the}} soap soda method, whiteness of the enzymatic degummed samples was satisfactory.

40|$|The China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone (CSPFTZ) {{has been}} {{established}} on September 29 th 2013 in Shanghai. Shanghai has been the center of many historical events. In the 19 th century, Shanghai was opened up {{to the outside world}} and forced to outside trade relations due to the Nanking Treaty of 1842 after the First Opium War (1839 - 1842) and was selected as a new port: the ‘Shanghai International Settlement’. The British, American and French settled in Shanghai and after 100 years Shanghai developed as the largest foreign trade port in China. Meanwhile, during the first Sino-Japanese War of 1895, China was mauled by a strong, Western influenced Japan. Attempts to reform China into a modern nation failed but after the 1911 Revolution, Shanghai emerged as a center of modern activities. The population doubled between 1895 and 1910 from 245, 675 to 501, 541 people as many Chinese were attracted by the city. During World War I (1914 - 1918) many people left while the diminished supply of Chinese export goods led to a higher demand of these export goods. Especially in the 1920 s and 1930 s, Shanghai grew as many <b>silk</b> <b>filatures,</b> cotton mills, and chemical works emerged. In the 1930 s, Shanghai’s Port served as the main shipping center in the Far East; the city was seen as a cosmopolitan city. However, in 1937 Japan bombed Shanghai and occupied parts of China again, which lasted until 1945. People lived under brutal circumstances under the occupation of Japan and the conditions to develop into a cosmopolitan city moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong. In 1949, the CCP, led by Mao Zedong, took power and focused on rural regions resulting in neglected cities; the nation controlled Shanghai and the city was forced to dispose of its cosmopolitan life. However, when Mao Zedong died in 1976, the balance of power changed: Hua Guofeng established the ‘Open Door’ policy in 1977 before Deng Xiaoping returned to power in 1978. The new policy led to the beginning of its modernization process and several Special Economic Zones (SEZs) were established mainly to attract foreign direct investment. 	Since the opening up until 1997, China attracted billions of foreign investment (US dollars) and by the mid- 1990 s, the economy moved away from a command economy to a functioning market economy. After 1978, China’s modernization process took off really quickly and created a gap between South China including its coastal regions and North-East China as the South and its coastal areas are developing much faster. Therefore, China can be divided into two different phases of modernization according to Rostow’s Five-Stages of Growth (1960). The South and its coastal regions can be assigned to the final phase of modernization while the North-East part of China can be assigned to phase three. The SEZs which have been established since 1978 are particular geographic regions in countries used to encourage export services, industry, and manufacturing. In China, initially four SEZs were established in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Xiamen and Shantou to test the new policies and new institutions for the market-oriented economy in order to improve China’s economy. The role SEZs, and especially Shenzhen, played in China’s modernization process was quite apparent as average annual growth has been 9. 4 percent since the 1980 s: the SEZs boost China’s economy and moved towards a more technology-intensive and higher-value economy. 34 years later, on 29 th September 2013, a new SEZ was established in Pudong, Shanghai: the CSPFTZ. The CSPFTZ {{has been established}} to enhance China’s economic position globally and to develop a new, replicable financial and administrative system which can be implemented in every region of the country. Nevertheless, the privileged status of ‘special’ is diminished since there are already many SEZs in China. However, as analysis shows, the zone operates differently from the majority of the SEZs which enables the CSPFTZ to offer enough advantages to attract foreign investors to be successful. The chances of success nonetheless depend on the government. The government encourages so many aspects and is experimenting with so many measures that the chance of success is questioned. But, if the government is able to achieve its aims, the CSPFTZ can be successful and could contribute to China’s South and coastal regions’ modernization process as the leading sectors shift towards more durable consumer goods and services in Rostow’s final phase. This thesis mainly compared the new Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone of September 2013 with China's previous most important Special Economic Zones...|$|R
