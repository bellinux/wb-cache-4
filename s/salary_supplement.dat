40|$|Working paper {{series on}} health and {{demographic}} change in the Asia-PacificEmerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose international security threats because of their potential to inflict harm upon humans, crops, livestock, health infrastructure, and economies. The following questions stimulated the research described in this paper: What infrastructure is necessary to enable EID surveillance in developing countries? What cultural, political, and economic challenges {{stand in the way}} of setting up such infrastructure? And are there general principles that might guide engagement with developing countries and support EID surveillance infrastructure? Using the U. S. Naval Area Medical Research Unit No. 2 as common denominator, this paper compares barriers to EID surveillance in Cambodia and Indonesia and presents key factors—uncovered through extensive interviews—that constrain disease surveillance systems. In Cambodia, the key factors that emerged were low salaries, poor staff and human resources management, the effect of patronage networks, a culture of donor dependence, contrasting priorities between the government and international donors, and a lack of compensation for animal culling. The Cambodian military has also played a part. The government ceased a merit-based <b>salary</b> <b>supplement</b> scheme for civil servants after the military is alleged to have demanded similar pay incentives that donors had no interest in funding. In Indonesia the key issues emerging as barriers to effective surveillance include poor host-donor relationships, including differing host-donor priorities and a misunderstanding of NAMRU- 2 by Indonesian authorities; low salaries; a decline in the qualifications of personnel in the Ministry of Health; poor compensation for animal culling; and difficulties incentivizing local-level reporting in an era of decentralization. As the interviews with in-country practitioners revealed, low levels of development in general are the main impediments to building EID surveillance infrastructure and are perhaps beyond the scope of health and scientific agencies at this point.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study using self administered questionnaire on locum practice and I sociodemographic and service factors influencing this practice {{as well as}} its effects on productivity and job stress was carried out among all government medical officers in the whole state of Negeri Sembilan and Malacca. Universally chosen samples were made of 335 doctors who hailed from Hospital and Health Divisions and from 154 who responded, only 147 samples were chosen and analyzed in the study. Productivity was measured using 7 productivity indexes and job stress was measured using 'Personal Stress Inventory'. Results revealed that 60. 6 % of medical officers had practiced locum before and 58. 4 % of them were still practicing locum during this study, Locum practice were mainly practiced at private clinics (88. 5 %), after work (94. 3 %), less than 10 hours a week (69. 3 %) and for <b>salary</b> <b>supplement</b> (58. 1 %), whereby, 65. 4 % of them had managed to earn less than RM 1000. Locum were still being practiced by 51. 9 % of male medical officers, 41. 0 % of medical officers aged less than 30 years, 43. 4 % of medical officers who had served less than 5 years and 55. 6 % of medical officers who had earned net income less than RM 1 000. t Meanwhile, 80. 9 % of medical officers who had earned gross income more than : RM 5 000 did not practice locum during the study.

No association was I found between locum practice and job stress (p> 0. 05). Hence, since locum is still being practiced by medical officers to earn extra income, without jeopardizing work productivity or causing job stress, it is suggested that the Ministry of Health should then legalize locum practice.

40|$|Abstract Background In 2004, the Malawian Ministry of Health {{declared}} a human resource crisis {{and launched a}} six year Emergency Human Resources Programme. This included <b>salary</b> <b>supplements</b> for key health workers and a tripling of doctors in training. By 2010, the number of medical graduates had doubled and significantly more doctors were working in rural district hospitals. Yet {{there has been little}} research into the views of this next generation of doctors in Malawi, who are crucial to the continuing success of the programme. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the factors influencing the career plans of medical students and recent graduates with regard to four policy-relevant aspects: emigration outside Malawi; working at district level; private sector employment and postgraduate specialisation. Methods Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with fourth year medical students and first year graduates, recruited through purposive and snowball sampling. Key informant interviews were also carried out with medical school faculty. Recordings were transcribed and analysed using a framework approach. Results Opportunities for postgraduate training emerged as the most important factor in participants’ career choices, with specialisation seen as vital to career progression. All participants intended to work in Malawi in the long term, after a period of time outside the country. For nearly all participants, this was in the pursuit of postgraduate study rather than higher salaries. In general, medical students and young doctors were enthusiastic about working at district level, although this is curtailed by their desire for specialist training and frustration with resource shortages. There is currently little intention to move into the private sector. Conclusions Future resourcing of postgraduate training opportunities is crucial to preventing emigration as graduate numbers increase. The lesser importance put on salary by younger doctors may be an indicator of the success of <b>salary</b> <b>supplements.</b> In order to retain doctors at district levels for longer, consideration should be given to the introduction of general practice/family medicine as a specialty. Returning specialists should be encouraged to engage with younger colleagues as role models and mentors. </p...|$|R

Studies have shown, however, that there is no difference between the wage return to professional baccalauréat holders pursuing further qualifications and the wage return to those who have actually studied for and obtained the 2 -year higher education diploma (around 13 %). Those who continue their studies would be rewarded with better pay in recognition of individual characteristics which are similar to those characteristics of holders of a 2 -year higher education diploma. Professional baccalauréat holders who have not continued to this level would have been weil advised to have done so, since even for courses not leading to a qualification the wage return would be 5. 2 %.

The following questions stimulated the research described in this report: What infrastructure is necessary to enable EID surveillance in developing countries? What are the cultural, political, and economic challenges that are faced? Are there generalizations that may be made to inform engagement with developing countries and support EID surveillance infrastructure? 	Using the U. S. Naval Area Medical Research Unit No. 2 (NAMRU- 2) as a common denominator, this report compares barriers to EID surveillance in Cambodia and in Indonesia and presents key factors—uncovered through extensive interviews—that constrain disease surveillance systems. 	In Cambodia, the key factors that emerged were low salaries, poor staff and human resources management {{and the effect of}} patronage networks, a culture of donor dependence, contrasting priorities between the government and international donors, and the lack of compensation for animal culling. Cambodian authorities have resisted a compensation scheme thus far, with speculation suggesting that {{the reason for this is}} the government’s concern that the possibility for corruption among poultry-holders is too great a risk. The Cambodian military has also played a part. The government ceased a merit-based <b>salary</b> <b>supplement</b> scheme for civil servants (including laboratory employees funded by the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria) after the military is alleged to have demanded similar pay incentives which donors had no interest in funding. In Indonesia, the key issues emerging as barriers to effective surveillance include poor host-donor relationships, including differing host-donor priorities and a misunderstanding of NAMRU- 2 by Indonesian Authorities; low salaries; a decline in the qualifications of personnel in the Ministry of Health; poor compensation for culling; and difficulties incentivizing local-level reporting in an era of decentralization. Conflict between external and host actors was given the greatest emphasis, with “viral sovereignty” the primary problem. The Indonesian government perceived unfair treatment when it was asked to pay millions of dollars for a vaccine developed from a sample it originally provided for diagnostic purposes to the U. S. government through NAMRU- 2. A poor host-donor relationship is a major barrier in Indonesia, which exhibits greater political and financial autonomy than Cambodia and other less-developed countries. 	Ultimately these differences are symptomatic of Cambodia’s and Indonesia’s different levels of development and their roles within the international community. This context demonstrates the primary difference in existing barriers to surveillance between the countries. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that other developing countries face similar barriers along a continuum from one extreme (Cambodia, where a genocide resulted in the death of a quarter of the population) to another (Indonesia, where state-of-the-art-labs can be run by Indonesians educated in countries such as France and Australia with some donor funds). 	Scientists are fully capable of fixing technical problems in surveillance systems, but non-technical barriers have been more difficult to confront. Not surprisingly, the primary challenges impeding surveillance are observed on the human resources side of the equation. 	When it comes to viral sovereignty, technology transfer has been proposed as a possible solution to enable resource-constrained countries to produce their own vaccines. Yet this is easier said than done; international development has tried for more than six decades to raise living standards with limited success. What is certain is that Indonesia’s human resources are already capable of producing some vaccines given sufficient technology, while Cambodia will require a decade or more to develop such a capability. It is clear that in Cambodia, technology transfer is necessary but not sufficient. 	Many of the key factors emerging from interviews with in-country practitioners are the direct result of the existing level of development and, as such, are perhaps beyond the scope of health and scientific agencies at this point. Nevertheless, greater understanding is a critical first step in mitigating negative outcomes. ...|$|E

Pharr, (706) 542 - 5172, pharr@arches. uga. edu CONTACT: David Shipley, (706) 542 - 7140 UGA LAW SCHOOL ANNOUNCES FOUR NEW FACULTY CHAIRHOLDERS ATHENS, Ga. - Four {{faculty members}} at the University of Georgia School of Law have been {{appointed}} to prestigious chaired professorships. They are: C. Ronald Ellington, named as the first holder of the new A. Gus Cleveland Chair of Legal Ethics and Professionalism; Paul J. Heald, named to the Allen Post Professorship; Walter Hellerstein, named Francis Shackelford Professor of Taxation; and Rebecca Hanner White, named to the J. Alton Hosch Professorship. 2 ̆ 2 Endowed chairs are extremely important to the law school because the privately-funded salary supplements enable us {{to attract and retain}} the finest teachers and scholars, 2 ̆ 2 said David Shipley, dean of the UGA law school. 2 ̆ 2 Chairs help assure that you will have someone {{at the top of the}} profession with your school for a long time. I 2 ̆ 7 m particularly pleased that these four chairs have been bestowed to outstanding members of our existing faculty, and I am grateful for the support provided by our generous friends of the law school. 2 ̆ 2 Ellington, formerly a J. Alton Hosch Professor at the School of Law, has been a member of the law school faculty since 1969, and served as dean from 1987 - 1993. He has served as chair of the State Bar of Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s Judicial Procedure and Administration Committee and for 10 years was a member of the Chief Justice 2 ̆ 7 s Commission on Professionalism. He currently serves as reporter for the State Bar of Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s Committee on Standards of the Profession, which is concerned with improving the transition into practice for beginning lawyers. Graduating students have twice selected Ellington as the recipient of the Student Bar Association and Younger Lawyers Section of the State Bar of Georgia Award for the Teaching of Legal Ethics, and he has been the recipient of the Faculty Book Award for Teaching Excellence on three occasions. In 1994, he was chosen as a UGA Senior Teaching Fellow. His areas of teaching and scholarship include Georgia Practice and Procedure, Civil Procedure, and Complex Litigation. Ellington earned his undergraduate degree in political science summa cum laude from Emory University, then earned his law degree from the University of Virginia, where he was inducted into legal education 2 ̆ 7 s highest academic honor society, the Order of the Coif, and served as notes editor of the Virginia Law Review. He studied as a Fellow in Law and Humanities at Harvard University and earned a master of laws degree from Harvard. Ellington was first named to a chaired professorship in 1981, the Law School Association Professorship, then became the Thomas R. R. Cobb Professor of Law in 1983, and a Hosch Professor in 1993. Prior to joining UGA 2 ̆ 7 s faculty, Ellington practiced law three years with the law firm of Sutherland, Asbill 2 ̆ 6 Brennan in Atlanta. 2 ̆ 2 Ron Ellington epitomizes professionalism in and out of the classroom through his teaching, his lectures to practitioners, and his tireless service to the bench and bar, 2 ̆ 2 said Shipley. 2 ̆ 2 He is held in very high regard by our students, UGA law alumni, and lawyers and judges throughout the state. His fit with the Cleveland Chair of Ethics and Professionalism is perfect. 2 ̆ 2 The A. Gus Cleveland Chair was created by a consent order reached in U. S. District Court at the end of 1998. DuPont Co. paid 2. 5 million to each of the state 2 ̆ 7 s four accredited law schools to settle an action seeking sanctions against it for alleged litigation misconduct in earlier product liability cases. Judge Hugh Lawson ordered that the money would be used to endow chairs devoted to teaching professionalism and ethics in the practice of law, and also ordered DuPont to pay 1 million to endow an annual ethics symposium which will be hosted by each law school on a revolving basis. The UGA law school announced in January that its chair would be named in honor of Cleveland, widely regarded as 2 ̆ 7 the father of continuing legal education in Georgia. 2 ̆ 7 Cleveland attended law school at UGA and served as one of the first presidents of its Law School Alumni Association. Heald, who turned 40 this summer, becomes the youngest professor to hold a chaired position in the history of the law school. He joined UGA in 1989 and teaches in the areas of Contracts, Intellectual Property, and Law and Literature. Recent scholarship includes Literature and Legal Problem Solving: Law and Literature as Ethical Discourse, a book to which he contributed and served as editor; and articles on law and literature, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property issues in such publications as the Duke Law Journal, the Supreme Court Review, Virginia Law Review, Texas Law Review and the Iowa Law Review, among many others. Heald earned his undergraduate degree in comparative literature cum laude with departmental distinction from the University of Illinois, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. A master 2 ̆ 7 s degree in comparative literature from the University of Illinois followed, and Heald worked as an English professor in Madrid, Spain and at Florida A 2 ̆ 6 M University for three years before enrolling in law school. He earned his law degree with honors from the University of Chicago, where he served as associate editor of the Chicago Law Review and was inducted as a member of the Order of the Coif. He served as judicial law clerk to the late Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr. of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upon his graduation from law school. During his tenure at UGA, Heald has also served as a visiting professor at the Université de Lyons in France, the University of Regensburg in Germany, and the University of Texas. 2 ̆ 2 Paul Heald is a very productive and eclectic scholar whose writings are having a substantial impact in several areas, including law and literature and the dynamic field of intellectual property, 2 ̆ 2 Shipley said. 2 ̆ 2 He is a rising star in legal education and a vital part of this faculty who more than satisfies the requirements of the Post Professorship. 2 ̆ 2 The Allen Post Professorship was established in September 1986 following Post 2 ̆ 7 s death in January of that same year. The Post family and his firm, Hansell and Post, formally initiated the professorship with a pledge of 100, 000. Post, a well known and respected Atlanta trial lawyer, was a UGA graduate and Rhodes Scholar. Hellerstein, a UGA law faculty member since 1978, is widely regarded as one of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s leading authorities on state and local taxation. He has frequently provided expert advice on tax issues to national policy makers and business leaders and has recently devoted much of his attention to the problems raised by state taxation of electronic commerce. (In June, he was summoned to address the inaugural meeting of the Congressional Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce in Williamsburg, Virginia.) Hellerstein is the author of numerous articles and books on state and local taxation, including the 2 -volume State Taxation (3 rd edition, 1998) and State and Local Taxation, Cases and Materials (6 th edition, 1997), both co-authored with his father, Jerome Hellerstein. Recent scholarship has appeared in the Cornell Law Review, the Tax Law Review, the Michigan Law Review, and the Journal of Taxation. In 1992, he received the Multistate Tax Commission 2 ̆ 7 s 25 th Anniversary Award for Outstanding Contributions to Multistate Taxation, and he is a member of the American Law Institute. Hellerstein earned his bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s degree in government magna cum laude from Harvard College, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He then earned his law degree cum laude from the University of Chicago, where he was elected to the Order of the Coif and served as editor-in-chief of the University of Chicago Law Review. He served as judicial law clerk to the late Chief Judge Henry J. Friendly of the Second Circuit U. S. Court of Appeals following his graduation from law school, then practiced with the law firm of Covington 2 ̆ 6 Burling in Washington, D. C. He was an associate professor at the University of Chicago for two years before joining the University of Georgia law faculty. 2 ̆ 2 Walter Hellerstein is held in high regard by both tax law practitioners and tax law professors around the nation, 2 ̆ 2 said Shipley. 2 ̆ 2 He is known as the last word on state tax issues [...] the nation 2 ̆ 7 s guru of state taxation. Professor Hellerstein 2 ̆ 7 s works have been cited by the United States Supreme Court, and he is having a significant impact on how e-commerce should be taxed. He is an excellent match for the Shackelford Professorship. 2 ̆ 2 The Francis Shackelford Professorship in Taxation was established by the Loridans Foundation of Atlanta in 1974 to provide a <b>salary</b> <b>supplement</b> for the work of a distinguished professor in a tax-related field. This Professorship honors a distinguished member of the bar and great friend of the UGA law school. White, who joined UGA in 1989, becomes the second woman to hold an endowed chair at the law school. She teaches in the areas of Labor Law, Employment Discrimination, Employment Law and Labor Arbitration, and has been selected by graduates five times as the recipient of the Faculty Book Award for Excellence in Teaching. In addition, she has also received the John C. O 2 ̆ 7 Byrne Award for Contributions Furthering Student/Faculty Relations. White 2 ̆ 7 s recent scholarship includes a book, Employment Law 2 ̆ 6 Employment Discrimination: Essential Terms and Concepts, and numerous articles on employment discrimination in such journals as the Emory Law Journal, William 2 ̆ 6 Mary Law Review, North Carolina Law Review, and the Ohio State Law Journal. White earned her undergraduate degree in English from Eastern Kentucky University, where she was named to Phi Kappa Phi. She graduated first in her class from the University of Kentucky College of Law, served as editor-in-chief of the Kentucky Law Journal and was elected to the Order of the Coif. White served as judicial law clerk to the late Chief Judge George C. Edwards of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upon graduation from law school. She then practiced labor and employment law at the law firm of Dinsmore 2 ̆ 6 Shohl in Cincinnati, Ohio before beginning her teaching career at UGA. 2 ̆ 2 Rebecca White is recognized as one of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s top young labor law scholars and a significant player in the discussion of major issues in the field of labor and employment law.

40|$|Strange {{though it}} may be, {{precisely}} todayâat {{a time when the}} Russian economy is making the transition to the marketânumerous zealots concerned with the people's welfare are once again foisting on public opinion the obviously stagnant idea of âthe social protection of the working people. â Before our very eyes, labor, as in the good old days, is once again becoming the object of the post-totalitarian state's social guardianship. We need only recall the notorious wage indexing, the <b>salary</b> <b>supplements</b> for everything possible including long service in the government apparatus, the bread subsidies, and the like. All these measures are portrayed as little less than a fatherly concern for the people. And when do these measures occur? In the middle of implementing market reforms! It is probably no secret to anyone that the lives of those who are so zealously guarded is nonetheless not getting better. In no way are potential raises in pensions, wages, and grants keeping pace with the high cost of living. ...|$|R

30|$|There {{are three}} general terms {{concerning}} teacher pay: compensation, remuneration, and salary. Compensation, a term {{widely used in}} North American, is everything the company provides an employee with in exchange for work. It {{is the sum of}} four components - base <b>salary,</b> <b>supplements,</b> benefits, and deferred compensation (Rowland and Potemski [2009]; Podgursky [2007]; Podgursky and Springer [2007], [2011]). Remuneration, widely used by the ILO ([2012]) and European countries, is interchangeable with the term ‘compensation’ in most contexts. Salary, what an employee can see on their paycheck, does not include any bonuses, benefits, or perks associated with the job. In this paper, compensation refers to the sum of base salary and all of the bonuses, benefits, and other payments (Podgursky and Springer [2007], [2011]). For example, a typical compensation package may include health insurance, performance bonuses, vision and dental insurance, and retirement plans. Each of these has a cost to the company and a value to the employee. But since they are not listed in employee's paycheck, they could not be regarded as ‘salary’.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Improving health workers' {{performance}} {{is vital for}} achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In the literature on human resource management (HRM) interventions to improve health workers' performance in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC), hardly any {{attention has been paid}} to the question how HRM interventions might bring about outcomes and in which contexts. Such information is, however, critical to assess the transferability of results. Our aim was to explore if realist review of published primary research provides better insight into the functioning of HRM interventions in LMIC. Methodology A realist review not only asks whether an intervention has shown to be effective, but also through which mechanisms an intervention produces outcomes and which contextual factors appear to be of critical influence. Forty-eight published studies were reviewed. Results The results show that HRM interventions can improve health workers' performance, but that different contexts produce different outcomes. Critical implementation aspects were involvement of local authorities, communities and management; adaptation to the local situation; and active involvement of local staff to identify and implement solutions to problems. Mechanisms that triggered change were increased knowledge and skills, feeling obliged to change and health workers' motivation. Mechanisms to contribute to motivation were health workers' awareness of local problems and staff empowerment, gaining acceptance of new information and creating a sense of belonging and respect. In addition, staff was motivated by visible improvements in quality of care and <b>salary</b> <b>supplements.</b> Only a limited variety of HRM interventions have been evaluated in the health sector in LMIC. Assumptions underlying HRM interventions are usually not made explicit, hampering our understanding of how HRM interventions work. Conclusion Application of a realist perspective allows identifying which HRM interventions might improve performance, under which circumstances, and for which groups of health workers. To be better able to contribute to an understanding of how HRM interventions could improve health workers' performance, a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods would be needed and the use of common indicators for evaluation and a common reporting format would be required. </p...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundUser fees {{have been}} shown to {{constitute}} a major barrier to the utilisation of health-care, particularly in low-income countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Importantly, such barriers can lead to the exclusion of vulnerable individuals from health-care. In 2008, a donor-funded primary health-care programme began implementing user fee subsidisation in 20 health zones of the DRC. In this study, we quantified the short and long-term effects of this policy on health-care utilisation. MethodsSixteen health zones were included for analysis. Using routinely collected health-care utilisation data before and after policy implementation, interrupted time series regression was applied to quantify the temporal impact of the user fee policy in the studied health zones. Payment of <b>salary</b> <b>supplements</b> to health-care workers and provision of free drugs - the other components of the programme - were controlled for where possible. ResultsFourteen (88 %) health zones showed an immediate positive effect in health-care utilisation rates (overall median increase of 19 %, interquartile range 11 to 43) one month after the policy was introduced, and the effect was significant in seven zones (P < 0. 05). This initial effect was sustained or increased at 24  months in five health zones but was only significant in one health zone at P < 0. 05. Utilisation reduced over time in the remaining health zones (overall median increase of 4 %, interquartile range ¿ 10 to 33). The modelled mean health-care utilisation rate initially increased significantly from 43 consultations/ 1000 population to 51 consultations/ 1000 population during the first month following implementation (P < 0. 01). However, the on-going effect was not significant (P = 0. 69). ConclusionsOur research brings mixed findings on the effectiveness of user fee subsidisation as a strategy to increase the utilisation of services. Future work should focus on feasibility issues associated with the removal or reduction of user fees and how to sustain its effects on utilisation in the longer term...|$|R
