Adequacy of the model to interpret the local phenomenon induced by addition of fillers was questioned. It was demonstrated that incorporation of hard fillers can enhance the <b>scratch</b> hardness of polymers as well as their basic mechanical properties but leads to an increase in <b>scratch</b> visibility due to a change in <b>scratch</b> deformation mode from ductile ploughing to a brittle failure with crack formation.

40|$|This study {{examines}} rock art sites containing <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs in the Bennett Hills, Idaho. Despite their research potential, <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs have received little attention in rock art research or literature. This study contributes valuable data to <b>scratched</b> rock art {{research and the}} corpus of rock art research in general. Two samples of ten <b>scratched</b> petroglyph sites were examined and recorded {{for a total of}} twenty petroglyph sites. Using formal and contextual research methods, multiple attributes of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are identified and analyzed. The formal qualities of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are examined to define the extent and to characterize the motif assemblage. Formal qualities were also studied to test hypotheses concerning the relationship between <b>scratched</b> and pecked petroglyph styles and associations between <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs and other archaeological phenomena. The contexts of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are studied on site and landscape scales to identify correlations with other archaeological phenomena and environments. The formal analyses revealed that there are more <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs in the Bennett Hills than records and literature currently indicate. Few site records document the presence of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs, although {{as a result of this}} analysis it appears to be ubiquitous in the Bennett Hills. It is possible that <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are under recorded in other locales as well, and that further investigations may identify a greater frequency of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs throughout the Great Basin. Proper identification of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs may alter how these properties are evaluated and in turn how they are managed. The Bennett Hills encompass a limited and unique assemblage of <b>scratched</b> petroglyph motifs that are dissimilar to petroglyphs manufactured using other techniques. This is significant in that it helps support the idea that <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are distinct. Rather than just an alternative method to pecking, <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs serve a unique function that is different from and independent of pecked petroglyphs. Contextual analyses indicated that <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are located in patterned and significant associations with artifacts, features, environments, and landscapes. The contextual analysis suggested that <b>scratched</b> rock art was produced in a public context in close proximity to subsistence related activities, perhaps in association with resource gathering events. There are various hypotheses that deal with the interaction between <b>scratched</b> and pecked petroglyph styles. <b>Scratched</b> petroglyphs occur both independent of and in association with other pecked petroglyph styles, although <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs do not commonly occur with any one pecked motif. When <b>scratched</b> and pecked petroglyph styles overlap <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are always later than and superimposed over earlier pecked petroglyphs. Data was collected to test three hypotheses concerning the intention of association between <b>scratched</b> and pecked petroglyphs. It does not appear that <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs serve to obliterate earlier pecked petroglyphs or function as a sketch that would be pecked later. There is evidence that some <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs enhance earlier pecked petroglyphs however, this hypothesis cannot sufficiently describe the range of patterns and associations found in the Bennett Hills <b>scratched</b> petroglyph assemblage. Hypotheses suggesting associations between <b>scratched</b> rock art and other archaeological phenomena were also examined. The association between <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs and <b>scratched</b> stones is deserving of further research. It may also be too soon to dismiss the association between <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs and quartz. The examination of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs in the Bennett Hills provides a unique insight into the minds of the makers of these petroglyphs, contributing valuable data our knowledge of the prehistoric peoples of the Bennett Hills and surrounding areas...|$|R

5|$|Between {{the mid-1980s}} {{and the first}} decade of the 2000s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of how hadrosaurids processed their food followed the model put forward in 1984 by David B. Weishampel. He proposed that the structure of the skull permitted motion between bones that resulted in backward and forward motion of the lower jaw, and outward bowing of the tooth-bearing bones of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed. The teeth of the upper jaw would grind against the teeth of the lower jaw like rasps, processing plant material trapped between them. Such a motion would parallel the effects of mastication in mammals, although accomplishing the effects in a completely different way. Work in the early 2000s has challenged the Weishampel model. A study published in 2008 by Casey Holliday and Lawrence Witmer found that ornithopods like Edmontosaurus lacked the types of skull joints seen in those modern animals that are known to have kinetic skulls (skulls that permit motion between their constituent bones), such as squamates and birds. They proposed that joints that had been interpreted as permitting movement in dinosaur skulls were actually cartilaginous growth zones. An important piece of evidence for Weishampel's model is the orientation of <b>scratches</b> on the teeth, showing the direction of jaw action. Other movements could produce similar <b>scratches</b> though, such as movement of the bones of the two halves of the lower jaw. Not all models have been scrutinized under present techniques. Vincent Williams and colleagues (2009) published additional work on hadrosaurid tooth microwear. They found four classes of <b>scratches</b> on Edmontosaurus teeth. The most common class was interpreted as resulting from an oblique motion, not a simple up-down or front-back motion, which is consistent with the Weishampel model. This motion is thought to have been the primary motion for grinding food. Two scratch classes were interpreted as resulting from forward or backward movement of the jaws. The other class was variable and probably resulted from opening the jaws. The combination of movements is more complex than had been previously predicted.|$|E

30|$|Two <b>scratch</b> directions, {{forward and}} backward, were {{selected}} to <b>scratch</b> the Si surface. As illustrated in Figure 1 a, forward <b>scratch</b> has the sharp cutting edge along the <b>scratch</b> direction, while the backward <b>scratch</b> uses the flat cutting edge facing the <b>scratch</b> direction. The influence of <b>scratch</b> direction {{on the size of}} the <b>scratched</b> geometry was initially investigated. The AFM images of the typical grooves in both directions are given in Figure 1 b, along with the corresponding cross-section profiles of the grooves as shown in Figure 1 c, where the <b>scratch</b> was performed at 1 μm/s of the <b>scratching</b> speed and 10 μN of the applied normal force. The cross-section profiles are V-shaped in both <b>scratch</b> conditions. However, the depth of the groove generated in the forward <b>scratch</b> is clearly deeper than that in the backward direction, as seen in Figure 1 c. This could be attributed to the sharpness of the tip in the forward direction, where the effective normal force was higher and a deeper groove was thus produced [27]. A similar phenomenon was observed in the investigation of AFM <b>scratch</b> on Si surface with diamond-coated Si tip [22 – 24, 28]. The pyramidal tip has three <b>scratching</b> faces as shown in Figure 1 d, the inclination angle, θ, is defined as the angle between the directions of <b>scratching</b> and cutting face. In the case of the backward direction, the tip <b>scratch</b> face is perpendicular to the <b>scratch</b> direction, i.e., the inclination angle, θ, equals 90 °, which satisfies the requirement to become orthogonal cutting. The protuberances are created evenly along two sides of the grooves. On the other hand, if <b>scratching</b> is in the forward direction, the <b>scratching</b> face is composed of two inclination angles, i.e., one is - 30 ° and the other is 30 °. As a result, the protuberances are squeezed evenly onto the two sides of the groove <b>scratched.</b> Since the 30 ° or - 30 ° inclination angle provides much more favorable stress states to squeeze the materials onto the two sides as compared with that of the 90 ° inclination angle, the protuberances created in forward <b>scratching</b> is more or larger than that of the backward direction.|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a larger}} effort to {{understand}} the fundamental knowledge of polymer <b>scratch</b> behavior, this dissertation is focused on both experimental study and numerical analysis of <b>scratch</b> deformation of a broad range of polymers, with an emphasis on the mechanical understanding of how the scratch-induced damage is formed. An instrumented progressive load <b>scratch</b> method recommended by ASTM/ISO standards was adopted for the experimental work. The commercial finite element (FE) method package ABAQUS was employed as a numerical simulation tool to describe the stress-strain fields, and it analyzes the deformation mechanisms during the <b>scratch</b> process. A thorough parametric study has been performed to assess the influence of material parameters and surface properties, such as Young's modulus, yield strength, and friction coefficient, on the polymer <b>scratch</b> behavior. Upon investigation of the <b>scratch</b> behaviors of a broad range of polymer materials, various kinds of <b>scratch</b> damage features are identified and correlated with the mechanical characteristics of the polymers. A generalized <b>scratch</b> damage mechanism map for polymers is presented. Correlation between different material types and <b>scratch</b> damage mechanisms is made. It is found that both the material characteristics and the stress state exerted on the <b>scratched</b> surface are responsible for the observed <b>scratch</b> damage mechanisms. The phenomenological deduction of the <b>scratch</b> damage process based on the stick-slip mechanism is established. A more realistic material law for the <b>scratch</b> analysis is also provided. To evaluate the polymer resistance against <b>scratch</b> visibility quantitatively, an entirely new automated on-set <b>scratch</b> visibility determination methodology is developed based on typical visual characteristics of human eyes.
