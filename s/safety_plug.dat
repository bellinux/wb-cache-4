He also effected many improvements in pneumatic ore stamps, finally perfecting and patenting those now known as Husband's oscillating cylinder stamps.|$|E
50|$|Domestic {{electrification}} simplified {{the operation}} of percolators by providing for a self-contained, electrically powered heating element that removed the {{need to use a}} stovetop burner. A critical element in the success of the electric coffee maker was the creation of safe and secure fuses and heating elements. In an article in House Furnishing Review, May 1915, Lewis Stephenson of Landers, Frary and Clark described a modular <b>safety</b> <b>plug</b> being used in his company's Universal appliances, and the advent of numerous patents and innovations in temperature control and circuit breakers provided for the success of many new percolator and vacuum models. While early percolators had utilized all-glass construction (prized for maintaining purity of flavor), most percolators made from the 1930s were constructed of metal, especially aluminum and nickel-plated copper.|$|E

5000|$|Second Lieutenant Jeppson, {{along with}} then Captain William [...] "Deak" [...] Parsons of the U.S. Navy were {{responsible}} for arming the atomic bomb [...] "Little Boy" [...] on the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber during the flight from Tinian to Japan. The bomb was protected from premature in-flight detonation by inserting three safety plugs into the electrical connection from its internal battery to the firing mechanism. This was designed to prevent a firing voltage from reaching the mechanism. Each plug was about {{the size and shape}} of a car cigarette lighter (approximately three inches in length), with a green cap for the <b>safety</b> <b>plug</b> and a red cap for the arming plug. Jeppson's role was to climb into the bomb bay and remove the three green safety plugs from the bomb and to replace them with the three red plugs just before the aircraft climbed to high altitude close the target area, a job that later caused controversy.|$|E

5|$|Parsons, the Enola Gays weaponeer, was {{concerned}} about the possibility of an accidental detonation if the plane crashed on takeoff, so he decided not to load the four cordite powder bags into the gun breech until the aircraft was in flight. Parsons and his assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, made their way into the bomb bay along the narrow catwalk on the port side. Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer wires, removed the breech plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the breech plug, and reconnected the wires. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three <b>safety</b> <b>plugs</b> between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red.

This fuel would still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back, consuming still more fuel. Replacing the pump would take hours; moving the Fat Man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well, as the bomb was live. 509th Composite Group Commander Colonel Paul Tibbets and Sweeney therefore elected to have Bockscar continue the mission.|$|R

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 August 1945, a second B-29 (Bockscar), piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, lifted off with Fat Man on board. This time, Ashworth served as weaponeer and Kokura was the primary target. Sweeney took off with the weapon already armed but with the {{electrical}} <b>safety</b> <b>plugs</b> still engaged. When they reached Kokura, they found cloud cover had obscured the city, prohibiting the visual attack required by orders. After three runs over the city, and with fuel running low, they headed for the secondary target, Nagasaki. Ashworth decided that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured, but a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed a visual approach as ordered. The Fat Man was dropped over the city's industrial valley midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works {{in the south and}} the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works in the north. The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT, roughly the same as the Trinity blast, but was confined to the Urakami Valley, and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, resulting in the destruction of about 44% of the city. The bombing also crippled the city's industrial production extensively and killed 23,200–28,200 Japanese industrial workers and 150 Japanese soldiers. Overall, an estimated 35,000–40,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{published}} literature assessing the efficacy {{and safety of}} lacrimal drainage system plug insertion for dry eye in adults. METHODS: Literature searches of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were last conducted on March 9, 2015, without date restrictions and were limited to English language abstracts. The searches retrieved 309 unique citations. The primary authors reviewed the titles and abstracts. Inclusion criteria specified reports that provided original data on plugs {{for the treatment of}} dry eyes in at least 25 patients. Fifty-three studies of potential relevance were assigned to full-text review. The 27 studies that met the inclusion criteria underwent data abstraction by the panels. Abstracted data included study characteristics, patient characteristics, plug type, insertion technique, treatment response, and safety information. All studies were observational and rated by a methodologist as level II or III evidence. RESULTS: The plugs included punctal, intracanalicular, and dissolving types. Fifteen studies reported metrics of improvement in dry eye symptoms, ocular-surface status, artificial tear use, contact lens comfort, and tear break-up time. Twenty-five studies included <b>safety</b> data. <b>Plug</b> placement resulted in ≥ 50 % improvement of symptoms, improvement in ocular-surface health, reduction in artificial tear use, and improved contact lens comfort in patients with dry eye. Serious complications from plugs were infrequent. Plug loss was the most commonly reported problem with punctal plugs, occurring on average in 40 % of patients. Overall, among all plug types, approximately 9 % of patients experienced epiphora and 10 % required removal because of irritation from the plugs. Canaliculitis was the most commonly reported problem for intracanalicular plugs and occurred in approximately 8 % of patients. Other complications were reported in less than 4 % of patients on average and included tearing, discomfort, pyogenic granuloma, and dacryocystitis. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of level II and III evidence in these studies, plugs improve the signs and symptoms of moderate dry eye that are not improved with topical lubrication, and they are well tolerated. There are no level I studies that describe the efficacy or safety of lacrimal drainage system plugs...|$|R

40|$|Hydrate {{plugging}} is {{a substantial}} problem in {{the oil and gas}} industry, both economically, environmentally and <b>safety</b> wise. <b>Plugging</b> may occur as a result of agglomeration of hydrate particles, deposition of hydrates on the pipeline wall, large hydrate particle loadings or a combination of the three. It would be an advantage to have the hydrates following the flow as a dispersion, instead of agglomerating and depositing onto the pipeline wall. This would prevent plugging. To do this, knowledge about the force between the hydrate and the pipeline material is required; A reduction in the brinewall adhesive force is likely to indicate that the pipeline is less subjected to hydrate deposition. In this work, the forces between hydrates or droplets of brine were investigated in various ways. A stirred beaker setup was developed to easily investigate the effect of flow on hydrate deposition. The goal was to create a large data set of the flow rate required to detach a hydrate particle or droplet from various surfaces. To do this, a flow loop is often involved, but such a setup has been found difficult use for this purpose. A setup where the surface material could be easily changed was required and developed. The setup lived up to its expectations, but has to be refined. The model used in these experiments was 15 wt% TBAB (Tetrabutylammonium bromide) in petroleum ether, and the solid surfaces investigated were glass, stainless steel, aluminum, brass and epoxy. The static contact angles of brine of different surfaces were measured, and the results were used to calculate the adhesion energy. It was found that the epoxy surface is the only oil-wet surface, with a low adhesion energy. The brass surface is slightly water-wet, while glass, stainless steel and aluminum all have low contact angles, and corresponding high adhesion energy. This indicates that a water droplet will adhere less strongly to a epoxy surface, compared to the other surfaces in question. Hydrates, in form of brine, hydrates grown on a surface and deposited hydrates, with and without acid in the oil phase, were tried detached from different surfaces, using the stirred beaker setup. A CFD model of the setup was used to determine the velocity of the fluid over the particle, and the drag force acting on the particle was calculated. It was found that the force needed to detach a water droplet and a deposited hydrate follows the trend of the calculated adhesion force between the solid surfaces and brine. It was also found that a hydrate grown on a surface adheres very strongly to the surface, while a deposited dry particle adhere very poorly. A wet hydrate, on the other hand, detaches at the same Reynolds number as a droplet of brine, which indicates that capillary forces are the governing adhesion mechanism. The stirred beaker setup was used to measure the dynamic contact angles of droplets of brine on various surface. An algorithm was used to calculated the force needed to dislodge the droplets. This force followed the trend of the calculated adhesion force between brine and the solid surfaces. There was {{reason to believe that the}} calculated forces were not correct, however, the fact that they followed the trend indicates that the setup can be used to make a trend. To calculated the exact forces, the algorithm has to be further developed...|$|R
