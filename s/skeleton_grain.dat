40|$|The {{consolidation}} {{problem in}} a plane strain porous elastic medium is treated by adopting a consistent formulation of the finite element model. To this purpose, the fluid-phase behaviour is modelled in static terms through a piecewise linear description of the pore pressure field and the behaviour of the two-phase medium is consistently modelled through rigorously equilibrated pie&cgrave;ewise linear stress distribution. Incompressibility of the pore fluid and of the <b>skeleton</b> <b>grains</b> is assumed, as is linear elastic behaviour of the solid phase. After a compact description of the model, the governing equations for the continuum problem are recalled and the solution system for the discretized problem is obtained following Galerkin's method of weighted residuals.

60|$|Thus, in all {{the great}} periods of the earth's history of which we know anything, {{a part of the}} then living matter has had the form of polypes, {{competent}} to separate from the water of the sea the carbonate of lime necessary for their own <b>skeletons.</b> <b>Grain</b> by grain, and particle by particle, they have built up vast masses of rock, the thickness of which is measured by hundreds of feet, and their area by thousands of square miles. The slow oscillations of the crust of the earth, producing great changes in the distribution of land and water, have often obliged the living matter of the coral-builders to shift the locality of its operations; and, by variation and adaptation to these modifications of condition, its forms have as often changed. The work it has done in the past is, for the most part, swept away, but fragments remain, and, if there were no other evidence, suffice to prove the general constancy of the operations of Nature in this world, through periods of almost inconceivable duration.|$|R
40|$|Ary Bruand : Present Address : Institut des Sciences de la Terre d'OrléansInternational audienceThin {{sections}} of soil surrounding maize roots were studied in {{scanning electron microscopy}} using the backscattered electron mode. The soil is a fine-loamy, mixed, mesic, Typic Eutrochrept. Backscattered electron scanning images (BESI) of the porosity surrounding a selected maize (Zea mays L.) root were studied by image analysis at the scale of micro- and mesopores. Image analysis of BESI revealed that the porosity was 22 to 24 % less within the soil surrounding the root than in the bulk soil. The bulk density increased up to 1. 80 Mg m− 3 close by the root-soil interface, although it was 1. 54 Mg m− 3 in the bulk soil. The porosity reduction consisted of a removal of the mesopores {{and a decrease in}} micropores, which resulted from the packing of <b>skeleton</b> <b>grains</b> with the porous clayey phase. The micropores were affected, although they are usually thought to be altered only with difficulty under natural conditions.

40|$|Suffusion is {{one major}} reason for {{dysfunctions}} of earth dams and embankments. Suffusion as a self-filtration process occurs when loose grains are mobilised and transported {{through a series of}} pores interconnected by pore constrictions formed by the skeleton. For the assessment of suffusion, the grain size distribution is divided into two parts: (i) skeleton, which transfers the load and forms the basic soil skeleton; and (ii) loose grains, which can be mobilised and removed by seepage flow. To date, most suffusion assessment methods based on self-filtration criteria assume that there is a sharp boundary in grain size distribution between soil <b>skeleton</b> and loose <b>grains</b> fraction. This paper suggests a new self-filtration criterion for suffusion assessment which was developed on a numerical approach on the grain scale. The major difference to existing criteria is the introduction of a smooth boundary between the <b>skeleton</b> and loose <b>grain</b> fraction. The new method has been tested with data from some experimental studie...|$|R
40|$|Palygorskite forms crusts or cutans on the {{surfaces}} of soil peds from two regions in Australia, Alice Springs (Northern Territory) and Eastern Riverina (New South Wales). Electron microscope examina-tion ofreplicas prepared from cutans showed the palygorskite fibers to be arranged in parallel orienta-tion within thick mats. Fibers were occasionally observed on top of coarse-grained <b>skeleton</b> <b>grains.</b> X-ray diffraction showed that, while the cutans contain almost exclusively palygorskite, the mineral is absent from within the soil peds. The chemical composition of crusts, determined by electron microprobe analysis, corresponds to that of Mg-rich palygorskite. Chemical examination of transects through crusts indicates that while the palygorskite content of the Northern Territory crusts is fairly constant, the mineralogically pure palygorskite in {{the periphery of the}} Riverina crust is becoming gradually intermixed with illite within the crust. The equilibrium constant of a pure Australian palygorskite (Mt. Flinders) was determined by dissolution in distilled water under air and nitrogen. The standard free energy of formation (aAFto) is- 1131. 5 kcal/mole. The information from the solubility experiments was used to construct stability diagrams showing the stability of palygorskite as a function of pH, pMg, and pSi. The composition of I:l water extracts from soil horizons containing palygorskite coatings, plotted onto one of these diagrams, falls within the stability field for palygorskite. It is concluded that soil water with a suitable composition, and not only lake water, can satisfy the conditions required for the formation of paly-gorskite, and that the pedogenic formation of that mineral is therefore feasible...|$|R
40|$|Although {{integrated}} clast macro and microfabric {{studies have}} been used to provide evidence of palaeo-ice flow directions, to discriminate between diamictons deposited in differing sedimentary environments, and to model the response of tills to subglacial deformation, such studies have typically only examined the ‘bulk’ fabric developed within the diamicton, largely ignoring the potential for several phases of fabric development within these typically polydeformed deposits. We present a new graphical method for the identification, description and analysis of clast microfabrics in polydeformed tills. This method utilises high resolution digital scans of orientated thin sections imported into a standard computer graphics package to measure the orientation of long axes of detrital (<b>skeleton)</b> <b>grains</b> included within the till. These data are then used to identify the main clast microfabrics present within the till, allowing the delineation of clast microfabric domains in which elongate grains share a similar preferred orientation. This process leads to the identification, characterisation and, most importantly, the interrelationships between the various generations of microfabrics. The relationships between these clast microfabrics and other microstructures (e. g. plasmic fabrics, turbate structures, shears, folds, faults…etc) can also be examined, providing a detailed microfabric-microstructural map of the thin section. Clast long axis orientation data collected for different parts of a thin section are plotted on a series of rose diagrams allowing the variation in clast microfabric orientation to be displayed graphically. A new set of terminology for the description of clast microfabrics in tills, which is based upon the system used by metamorphic petrologists, is also presented. Three case studies of the fabrics present within subglacial sediments of Pleistocene age as well as the present are used as examples of how to apply this methodology. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{petrographic}} and geochemical {{characterization of}} core materials used to craft bronze artworks represents a recognized tool in archaeometallurgical studies. It can provide relevant {{contributions to the}} solution of knowledge problems such as those related {{with the development of}} art foundry, as well as provenance, attribution and dating of the object under study (e. g. [1] and references therein). Notwithstanding, till today only a few investigations have been carried out on the topic, mainly concerning ancient age artistic productions. Overviews regarding core materials used in Renaissance bronzes have been reported by some Authors [2, 3, 4], but further insights are needed in order to achieve a deeper knowledge on 15 th and 16 th centuries art foundry, especially concerning large bronze artworks. Here we report a petrographic study of casting cores of masterpieces by Lorenzo Ghiberti (Sacrificio di Isacco, 1401, and Porta del Paradiso, 1425 - 1452), Donatello (David and Amore-Attis, 1430 - 1450), Andrea del Verrocchio (Incredulità di San Tommaso, 1466 - 1483), Giovan Francesco Rustici (Predica del Battista, 1506 - 1511) and Vincenzo Danti (Decollazione del Battista, 1570 - 1571). Samples were taken from these artworks and studied by means of polarized light microscopy in thin (cross) section, computerized image analysis, XRD, SEM-EDS. The core materials of these sculptures show remarkable petrographic similarities, thus suggesting a well established tradition in the selection and processing of raw materials, kept during the whole period analysed. The collected data suggest the general use of silty-sandy clays, provided from the origin with a certain content of natural temper components, to which variable contents of chamotte fragments and organic fibres have been purposely added. In some artworks, a further addition of sand can be hypothesized. Gypsum additions have been observed in Verrocchio’s and Rustici’s sculptures. Probable differences in supply localities of raw materials are testified by weak differences in composition of matrix and <b>skeleton</b> <b>grains,</b> being anyway coherent with the Florentine geological background. Colour, mineralogical association and microstructure are quite variable among different artefacts and sometimes within a single artefact, strongly depending on the distance from the metal wall (i. e. transient heating produced by metal pouring), on the presence of organic matter and on the exposition (closed or open shapes, or possible pre-cooking before the casting). General and peculiar features pointed out in the present work provide important data on the evolution of the art foundry during the Renaissance and Mannerism...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring {{compaction}} band formation various mechanisms can {{be involved}} at different scales. Mechanical and chemical {{degradation of the}} solid <b>skeleton</b> and <b>grain</b> damage are important factors that may trigger instabilities {{in the form of}} compaction bands. Here we explore the conditions of compaction band formation in quartz- and carbonate-based geomaterials by considering the effect of chemical dissolution and grain breakage. As the stresses/deformations evolve, the grains of the material break leading to an increase of their specific surface. Consequently, their dissolution is accelerated and chemical softening is triggered. By accounting for (a) the mass diffusion of the system, (b) a macroscopic failure criterion with dissolution softening and (c) the reaction kinetics at the micro level, a model is proposed and the conditions for compaction instabilities are investigated. Distinguishing the micro-scale (grain level) from the macro-level (Representative Elementary Volume) and considering the heterogeneous microstructure of the REV it is possible to discuss the thickness and periodicity of compaction bands. Two case studies are investigated. The first one concerns a sandstone rock reservoir which is water flooded and the second one a carbonate rock in which CO 2 is injected for storage. It is shown that compaction band instabilities are possible in both cases...|$|R

40|$|In this {{contribution}} the hydro-mechanically coupled behaviour of a sand is experimentally investigated {{with the}} focus on settlements induced by changes in degree of saturation and suction. This phenomenon, referred to as collapse behaviour, is attributed to rearrangements of the <b>grain</b> <b>skeleton</b> due to changing capillary effects on wetting of the soil. For the experimental investigation of the collapse behaviour of a medium coarse sand cyclic drying-wetting tests are performed under oedometric conditions. In the test set-up a sand specimen, subjected to a constant small vertical stress, is cyclically dried and wetted by volume control of the pore water, whereas matric suction is measured using a tensiometer implemented to the specimen loading plate (topcap tensiometer). The test procedure, originally designed to investigate the hysteretic nature of the soil-water characteristic curve of the sand, allows to measure the one dimensional volume change of the specimen as evoked by the applied hydraulic paths under constant net stress. By varying the specimen void ratio the impact of density on the collapse behaviour can be assessed. The test data {{is important for the}} development of a mechanical constitutive model which can take the volume change behaviour due to suction changes into account...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the microstructure on the tolerance of WC-Co cemented carbides to corrosion damage was studied by using residual strength as the critical design parameter. In doing so, samples were immersed in synthetic mine water solution for different times, and changes induced by corrosion exposure were assessed. A detailed 3 D FIB/FESEM tomography characterization of corrosion damage-microstructure interactions is included. Results reveal that corrosion damage may result in relevant strength degradation {{on the basis of}} stress rising effects associated with the formation of surface corrosion pits. Thus, as immersion time increases strength gradually decreases. Fractographic examination reveals the formation of semi-elliptical and sharp corrosion pits for studied medium- and ultrafine-sized cemented carbides, respectively. The latter has a much more pronounced stress rising effect, and consequently higher strength losses were determined for ultrafine grades. Corrosion process consists of a selective attack of the binder that is dissolved in the corrosive media. Initially, it is located at centres of binder pools and as exposure time in the media increases, corrosion evolves consuming the rest of the pools which finally leaves an unsupported WC <b>grain</b> <b>skeleton</b> at the surface.

It is well established that when the pore fluid pressure rises, the shear resistance of fluid-filled granular systems decreases, {{and as a result}} catastrophic events such as soil liquefaction, earthquakes, and accelerating landslides may be triggered.

40|$|Abstract There {{is little}} {{data on the}} {{mineralogy}} of carbonate pedofeatures in the calcareous soils in Hungary which belong to the European prairie ecodivision. The aim {{of the present study}} is to enrich these data. The mineralogical composition of the carbonate pedofeatures from characteristic profiles of the calcareous soils in Hungary was studied by X-ray diffractometry, thermal analysis, SEM combined with microanalysis, and stable isotope determination. Regarding carbonate minerals only aragonite, calcite (+ magnesian calcite) and dolomite (+proto-dolomite) were identified in carbonate <b>grains,</b> <b>skeletons</b> and pedofeatures. The values relating, respectively, to stable isotope compositions (C 13, O 18) of carbonates in chernozems and in salt-affected soils were in the same range as those for recent soils (latter data reported earlier). There were no considerable differences between the values for the carbonate nodules and tubules from the same horizons, nor were there significant variations between the values of the same pedofeatures from different horizons (BC-C) of the same profile. Thus it can be assumed that there were no considerable changes in conditions of formation. Tendencies were recognized in the changes of (i) carbonate mineral associations, (ii) the MgCO 3 content of calcites, (iii) the corrected decomposition temperatures, and (iv) the activation energies of carbonate thermal decompositions among the various substance-regimes of soils. Differences were found in substance-regimes types of soils rather than in soil types. ...|$|R

The thixotropic microstructures obtained were characterized in detail and linked to the corresponding tensile properties. When the liquid fraction increased (the solid fraction decreased), an initial reduction in the tensile properties was perceived. The lowest tensile properties were obtained at liquid fractions of 35 % (610 °C), 25 % (623 °C), and 40 % (585 °C) for AA 2024, AA 6061, and A 356 alloys, respectively. For the AA 6061 and A 356 alloys, a further increase in the liquid fraction resulted in improvement of the tensile properties. However, for the AA 2024 alloy, the samples could not withstand their own weight at higher liquid fractions that further tensile tests were rendered. It was concluded that for alloys below the liquid fraction corresponding to the minimum tensile properties, the structural properties of interconnected <b>grains</b> (<b>skeletons),</b> and the quenched liquid eutectic phase located at the grain boundaries (liquid film) controlled the fracture behavior.

Viscous-like behavior dominates under well-drained conditions and leads to a linear relationship between pore pressure and volumetric strain rate. Numerical simulations reveal the possibility of liquefaction under drained and initially over-compacted conditions, which were often believed to be resistant to liquefaction. Under such conditions liquefaction occurs during short compactive phases that punctuate the overall dilative trend. In addition, the previously recognized generation of elevated pore pressure under undrained compactive conditions is observed.
