In attempt to get Billy to speak, Doggett keeps his backpack from him. This infuriates Lisa and leads Scully to question Doggett’s expertise in child abduction cases. Scully suggests that Billy is an alien abductee, but Doggett believes Ronald Purnell, a local , may {{have been involved in the}} boy's disappearance. Doggett questions Purnell, who expresses confusion when the agent suggests that he should meet Billy.

The FBI locate Dees' home, but his electronic surveillance had alerted him long before, and he has escaped before they even arrive. However, as Black <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car, he receives a call from Dees, who has booby-trapped the car. The FBI are able to monitor this call with Dees' equipment. Dees tells Black that they will both soon be famous, letting Black know that he has a remote detonator for the car's explosives. Before he can use it, he is killed by a police marksman.|$|E

Clark expresses fear that Lana is {{drifting}} away because of his secret, so he decides to reveal his powers to her. Clark then uses the coal to make a diamond ring and proposes marriage. Afterward, Clark reveals {{what he did to}} his parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole), who tell him that he is old enough to make decisions on his own without the advice of his father.

5|$|Mr. Connors {{is fired}} by the school board due to the {{violence}} associated with wrestling, after the board fails {{to make a distinction}} between what he teaches and professional wrestling (as do the town bar regulars). They also find videos of Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling on his iPhone and mistake them for gay pornography. The boys are excited to learn WWE Chairman Vince McMahon has heard of their federation and will be scouting one of their shows. Mr. Connors <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> apartment surrounded by awards for wrestling and in tears over his termination and what wrestling has become. Vengeful, he plans to sabotage the event in a personal vow to restore the integrity of the wrestling sport. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny secretly decide to relegate Butters, Jimmy and Token to smaller roles, thinking that it will give themselves a better opportunity to impress McMahon. They hold tryouts {{in the manner of a}} theater audition in order to find new talent for their show, which is now more reminiscent of musical theatre than wrestling.|$|E

The woman <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and rests by the fire. The beast watches her from his hall of mirrors and contemplates approaching her but is ashamed of his appearance. She later is seen having a bath interspersed with the police officers finding the dead officer's body and preparing to raid the castle. She is later seen trying to sleep while being seduced by 3 vampy women while the Beast {{sits in a chair}} (a reference to Dracula and the Brides). The Beast leaves the room and, seeing his reflection, begins to smash up the mirrors. The woman, hearing the noise, comes out and follows him into a presumable living room. The Beast observes her from above and levitates the chaise she is sitting on.|$|E

25|$|In {{the middle}} of the {{controversy}} and court appeal, Panahi broke the ban imposed on him from making films and made the documentary feature This Is Not a Film (2011) in collaboration with Iranian filmmaker Mojtaba Mirtahmasb. This film was made for €3,200 and shot on a digital camcorder and, partly, an iPhone. It was shot in four days over a ten-day period in March 2011 and its title was inspired by René Magritte's painting The Treachery of Images. In the film, Panahi <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> apartment making phone calls about his court case, watching TV news stories, interacting with his neighbors, talking about his past films and describing scenes from the film that he had begun shooting when he was arrested (much as he had described scenes from films to his sisters as a child). Ten days before the opening of the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, This Is Not a Film was announced as a surprise entry into the festival. It was smuggled out of Iran on a USB thumb drive that had been hidden inside a cake. Panahi's wife and daughter attended the festival. In December 2012 it was shortlisted as one of 15 films eligible for Best Documentary Feature at the 85th Academy Awards.|$|E
500|$|As a distraught Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> apartment, he {{receives}} {{a phone call}} from Kritschgau, who tells him that [...] "they" [...] may be listening. Mulder, spotting a small hole in his ceiling, rushes upstairs and bursts into the apartment above his and kills government employee Scott Ostelhoff. He tells Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) about the incident, telling her that Ostelhoff had made numerous calls to the FBI.|$|E
500|$|A concept album, Man on the Moon: The End of Day is an autobiographical track {{series of}} moody dark {{material}} that is separated into five acts that all surround [...] "Day 'n' Nite" [...] with an arcane account. One reviewer summed up the story to be: [...] " [...] lonely guy <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> room and dreams of success. He uses drugs to calm his fears and fend off night terrors. He eventually gets recognized as the star he always knew he was, and lives the superstar life… or maybe he's still dreaming about that stage of his life, and we're just witnessing what his dreams sound like." [...] According to Cudi, more lively songs had to be added so that listeners did not feel like they were listening to a [...] "slit-your-wrists album". It was observed by a reviewer that on Man on the Moon: The End of Day, Cudi neither raps nor sings, instead he goes [...] "puzzling through some third way: a sort of loose, hazily melodic talking." [...] Musical collaborators included Kanye West, Ratatat and MGMT, among others, and the record is narrated by Common. Lyrically, he raps about anxiety and his frequent nightmares.|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] {{said the}} Blacksmith who made Death <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> pear-tree until the wind whistled through his ribs--"that, methinks, {{is a better}} thing to tell for a sermon than a story." ...|$|R

500|$|Chief among Burroughs' {{complaints}} was Long's {{questioning of}} the role of instinct in animal learning, something that Burroughs and many scientists of the day accepted without doubt. Long had written that after many years of studying wild animals, he was [...] "convinced that instinct plays a much smaller part than we have supposed; that an animal's success or failure in the ceaseless struggle for life depends, not upon instinct, but upon the kind of training which the animal learns from its mother." [...] In reply to this assertion, Burroughs wrote in [...] "Real and Sham Natural History": [...] "The crows do not train their young. They have no fortresses, or schools, or colleges, or examining boards, or diplomas, or medals of honor, or hospitals, or churches, or telephones, or postal deliveries, or anything of the sort. Indeed, the poorest backwoods hamlet has more of the appurtenances of civilization than the best organized crow or other wild animal community in the land!" [...] Burroughs summed up by deeming Long a fraud, stating that his [...] "book reads like that {{of a man who has}} really never been to the woods, but who <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> study and cooks up these yarns from things he has read in Forest and Stream, or in other sporting journals. Of real observation there is hardly a vestige in his book; of deliberate trifling with natural history there is no end".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1920s, Ernst Krenek criticized {{a certain}} unnamed brand of {{contemporary}} music (presumably Schoenberg and his disciples) as [...] "the self-gratification {{of an individual}} who <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> studio and invents rules according to which he then writes down his notes." [...] Schoenberg took offense at this masturbatory metaphor and answered that Krenek [...] "wishes for only whores as listeners" [...]|$|E
2500|$|Aschenbach <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{chair on}} the Lido beach, {{watching}} Tadzio and his friends play. Aschenbach's thoughts (voiced by the chorus) are of the gods Phaedra, Apollo and Hyacinthus, their actions mirroring those of Tadzio. The boys compete {{in a variety of}} sports: running, long jump, discus, javelin and wrestling. Tadzio wins conclusively, and Aschenbach is inspired artistically by the boy's beauty, as [...] "...thought becomes feeling, feeling thought". Aschenbach determines to congratulate Tadzio on his victory, but when the opportunity arises, he cannot bring himself to speak. Almost choking on the words, Aschenbach realises the truth: [...] "I – love you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stan is {{described}} as [...] "opinionated and curmudgeonly" [...] retired Billingsgate fishmonger with a manipulative side. He {{is said to be}} [...] "delighted" [...] to be around his children again, as he has been lonely since his wife left him 30 years ago. A show spokesperson said, [...] "Stan is no fluffy old man in a cardigan, and it won't be long before he starts manipulating the whole Carter clan from the comfort of his armchair." [...] Executive producer, Dominic Treadwell-Collins, introduced Stan as part of his plan to reinvigorate the show's older generation and teased Stan would [...] "start to fill in some holes in the dark Carter family history." [...] Treadwell-Collins based Stan on his own grandfather, saying [...] "Stan Carter is my grandfather, a former Billingsgate fish porter who was a big powerful man and now <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair still trying to rule his family." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl {{resolve to}} defeat Frank D'Amico {{once and for}} all. Hit-Girl infiltrates Frank's headquarters, and kills {{numerous}} guards and henchmen before running out of bullets. When she is cornered by the thugs, Kick-Ass arrives on a jet pack fitted with miniguns and kills the remaining thugs. Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl then take on Frank and Red Mist. Kick-Ass fights Red Mist and they knock each other out. Frank overpowers an exhausted Hit-Girl. Before he can kill her, Kick-Ass regains consciousness and shoots him with a bazooka. Frank is blasted {{out of the window}} and explodes in mid-air. Dave and Mindy retire from crime-fighting. Marcus becomes Mindy's guardian, and she enrolls at Dave's school. Meanwhile, Chris D'Amico <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> father's office, dressed in an upgraded suit. Facing the camera, he says, [...] "as a great man once said, wait'll they get a load of me," [...] before firing a gun at the audience.|$|E
2500|$|In one {{incident}} Dermot Whelan, Dave Moore and Siobhan O'Connor of radio station 98FM rewrote the Steps song [...] "Tragedy" [...] to include lyrics which make personal references to Tubridy before playing {{it on their}} morning radio show. The song pokes fun at his famous ears {{as well as his}} hairstyle with the line: [...] "His ears stand up like the FA Cup, he <b>sits</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair chatting with Holy Communion-style hair". Tubridy himself rang the show to congratulate Dermot, Dave and Siobhan on their achievement of [...] "taking the mick out of him" [...] with a song of [...] "pure ego" [...] that caused him to [...] "burst out laughing when I saw it". He was less pleased when Gordon Ramsay, appearing as a guest on The Late Late Show, poked fun at his ears and weight; Tubridy later remarked on The Ray D'Arcy Show: [...] "I thought he was a bit, em, British for my liking. I won’t be buying the books [...] In fact, I didn't take the free one".|$|E
