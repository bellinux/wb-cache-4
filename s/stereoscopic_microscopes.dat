5000|$|Abbe in 1880 {{designed}} an orthoscopic eyepiece for <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>microscopes</b> which minimized distortion. The {{term was}} also used in stereoscopy by Heine [...] for the condition when the perceived depth in a stereogram {{is the same as}} that in the actual view of the scene. Such a perceptual report by an observer must be distinguished from what Moritz von Rohr called homeomorphic view, in which the depth in a stereoscopic 3D reconstruction is merely geometrically true, see Stereoscopic Depth Rendition. The difference between [...] homeomorphic and orthoscopic is typical of the divide in psychophysics between the world of physical stimuli and the world of subjects' percepts, see Gustav Fechner.|$|E
40|$|The {{prospects}} for allotransplantation of pancreatic islets in man {{depend on the}} development of methods that provide sufficient quantities of pancreatic islets from a single donor, which are capable, when transplanted, of achieve the normalization of carbohydrate metabolism. Objective: Evaluate the efficacy of the isolation of Langerhans islets from dogs, by means of mechanical-enzymatic separation technique with stationary digestion using collagenase, and purification with a discontinuous dextran density gradient. Methods: The counting of islet numbers and evaluation of their sizes was accomplished by staining with diphenylthiocarbazone and using <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>microscopes</b> equipped with eyepiece reticule for the measurement of average diameters of stained islets. Results: The results disclosed that the average number of islets isolated was 81032. 20 ± 24736. 79 and the average number of islets isolated per kg of body weight was 6938. 70 ± 1392. 43. The average number of islets isolated per kg of body weight showed significant correlation with body weight and weight of the pancreas resected. Conclusion: The number of islets isolated, of a single donor, by mechanical-enzymatic separation, stationary collagenase digestion and discontinuous dextran density gradient purification can be sufficient to success of pancreatic islets transplant in dogs...|$|E

This work presents a morphological description of Amblyomma brasiliense larvae (F 1) and a redescription of nymphs (F 1). A. brasiliense is reported {{as one of the most}} aggressive ticks to humans in Brazil.

30|$|This study {{observed}} the air-drying of self-etching primer using the MoraVision™ 2 3 D video microscope system. This system has two main components: MoraScope™ and MoraVu 3 D™. The MoraScope {{is made of}} two self-contained digital <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>microscopes</b> in one housing. It combines two zoom stereo microscopes and their high definition (HD) video cameras into one compact (applox. 13  cm) cube to provide magnification levels from 0.5 to 30 × [37]. The MoraVu 3 D is a real time stereoscopic display module. 3 D real-time images are projected to the liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor when the dentist and their dental assistants wear 3 D glasses [38]. With typical microscopes, {{it is necessary to}} illuminate the surgical field with a high intensity LED light source when the expanded surgical field of view is used, because the high magnification images are darker than the normal images. Since restorative composite material will be polymerized by the LED illuminator, it is impossible to spend a long time shaping and contouring the composite restoration under the expanded surgical microscope field. On the other hand, MoraVision 2 microscope can project a clear image even with relatively weak illumination. Therefore, in a clinical situation, it is possible to spend more time shaping the anatomical contours under the expanded operating view.|$|E

40|$|Rotylenchulus reniformis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} nematode pests of pigeonpea. A simple greenhouse technique has been developed to aid evaluation of pigeonpea genotypes for resistance to R. reniformis. In greenhouse pot experiments, eggsacs of R. reniformis in pigeonpea (cv. ICPL 87) roots were counted by eye and with the aid of a <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>microscope</b> at 15, 30 and 45 days after seedling emergence in soils infested with various numbers of vermiform R. reniformis. Seedlings were rated for the number of eggsacs per root system on a one (no eggsacs) to nine (more than 50 eggsacs) scale. Eggsac ratings were more uniform when roots were evaluated at 30 – 45 days than at 15 days and an inoculum of 15 to 30 individuals/cm 3 soil also helped reduce variability. Eggsacs were not easily visible without the aid of a <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>microscope.</b> Of the 14 stains tested, exposure of nematode-infected roots to 0. 25 % trypan blue for three min was effective in staining the eggsacs blue without staining the roots.

30|$|The {{mineralogy}} {{of individual}} ash particles was investigated by <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>microscope</b> observation (on particles > 125  µm) and SEM–EDS semiquantitative analysis focusing on textures, shapes, color, and chemical composition. The ash morphology was observed using <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>microscope</b> and a {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM, JSM- 6610 LV with a tungsten filament; JEOL Co.) at Akita University. Semiquantitative microprobe analysis was carried out with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, INCA X-act; Oxford Instruments) attached to the SEM. Semiquantitative analysis was carried out at an acceleration voltage of 15  kV, a probe current of 2.2  nA, a working distance of 10  mm, and a live time of 20  s.
