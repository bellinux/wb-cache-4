40|$|A {{theoretical}} calculation is presented of current noise which is due charge fractionalization, in two interacting edge channels in the integer quantum Hall state at filling factor ν= 2. Because of the capacitive coupling between the channels, a tunneling event, {{in which an}} electron is transferred from a biased <b>source</b> <b>lead</b> {{to one of the}} two channels, generates propagating plasma mode excitations which carry fractional charges on the other edge channel. When these excitations impinge on a quantum point contact, they induce low-frequency current fluctuations with no net average current.

30|$|The {{value of}} {{speed of the}} heat source has {{significant}} effects on all the studied functions. Increasing {{the values of the}} speed of the heat <b>source</b> <b>leads</b> to decreasing the temperature increment values and the absolute values of the stress before the peaks, while after the peaks, the increase of the speed of the heat <b>source</b> <b>leads</b> to increases in them. Increasing the values of the speed of the heat <b>source</b> <b>leads</b> to decreasing of the strain and the displacement values. The results and the figures have max or min points because the effect of the heat source is working in the interval x < υ t so the temperature increment increases rapidly, while in the interval x >υ t the heat source disappears, which makes the temperature increment decrease rapidly. Accordingly, all the other functions will be affected by this attitude. In other words, the value of the position x = υ t is a critical position because it separates between the existence of the heat source and its disappearance. The effects of the moving heat source of the current results agree with the results in (Youssef [22 – 24]; Youssef, Al-Lehaibi [25]).|$|R

When applying rare-earth doped fiber lasers as the pump source, the strong temporal fluctuations in the pump <b>source</b> <b>lead</b> to spectral broadening in co-pumped manner, while the natural low-pass filter in countered-pumped case can still ensure single-frequency operation. Furthermore, applying temporal stable laser, such as single-frequency fiber laser or narrow band fiber laser spectral broadened by phase modulation technique, as the pump source would be superior for high-performance single-frequency RFA for the both two pump manners.

During this process, the highly regioselective nitrogen-centred radical addition to internal and terminal alkynes generating vinyl radicals {{and the next}} explicit migration of aryl group from the nitrogen <b>source</b> <b>lead</b> the following efficient desulfonylation, oxygenation, and semi-pinacol rearrangement.

We find that by using a non-halide lead <b>source</b> (<b>lead</b> acetate) instead of lead chloride or iodide, the perovskite crystal growth is much faster, which allows us to obtain ultrasmooth and almost pinhole-free perovskite films by a simple one-step solution coating with only a few minutes annealing.

40|$|A unique {{reconstruction}} {{of the image of}} a high redshift source galaxy responsible for multiple long arcs in the z = 0. 4 cluster 0024 + 1654 is obtained by inverse lensing. Deep B and I imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope (Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, under NASA contract NAS 5 - 26555) enables high resolution of the arcs due to strong gravitational lensing of the background source. The gravitational lens in the foreground cluster is thus used to obtain a magnified view of the distant source. Four strongly lensed images of the <b>source</b> <b>lead</b> to a unique reconstruction. Each of the long arcs, when unlensed, leads to the same reconstructed source image exhibiting a beaded ring-like morphology. The U luminosity of the ring alone is equivalent to a normal galaxy.

40|$|We study {{theoretically}} the entanglement {{created in}} a scattering between an electron, incoming from a <b>source</b> <b>lead,</b> and another electron bound {{in the ground}} state of a quantum dot, connected to two leads. We analyze {{the role played by}} the different kinds of resonances in the transmission spectra and by the number of scattering channels, into the amount of quantum correlations between the two identical carriers. It is shown that the entanglement between their energy states is not sensitive to the presence of Breit-Wigner resonances, while it presents a peculiar behavior in correspondence of Fano peaks: two close maxima separated by a minimum, for a two-channel scattering, a single maximum for a multi-channel scattering. Such a behavior is ascribed to the different mechanisms characterizing the two types of resonances. Our results suggest that the production and detection of entanglement in quantum dot structures may be controlled by the manipulation of Fano resonances through external fields.

Assuming that the fragmentation proceeds statistically and that the collisions in the <b>source</b> <b>lead</b> to a Boltzmann-like distribution of the internal energy, a characteristic parameter, the effective temperature, is introduced to describe the internal energy distribution of the ions observed. The hypotheses, advantages and drawbacks of {{the implementation of the}} method that uses substituted benzylpyridinium salts as thermometer ions are discussed. Use is made of two matrices that produce no matrix cations in MELDI and are suitable for small cationic salts. The actual value of this effective temperature significantly depends on an accurate determination of the threshold dissociation energies and on the time spent in the source, in addition to the statistical hypothesis itself. The method could be applied to normalize spectra in order to compare results issued from different instruments. Peer reviewe...|$|E

30|$|The organic {{matters in}} {{secondary}} effluents are commonly low {{to meet the}} demands of electron donors for anoxic denitrification and energy for cell growth and maintenance (Hallin et al. 2006). Hence, external organic carbon is required for wastewater tertiary denitrification process to avoid incomplete denitrification and nitrite accumulation. The external organic carbon always includes common organic carbon source (e.g. methanol, acetate and ethanol) and alternative carbon source (e.g. hydrolysis products of primary sludge and solid waste, glycerin-based byproduct of biofuel production) (Cherchi et al. 2009; Lu et al. 2014). Under a given plant size, hydraulic load, influent water quality and operation conditions of a denitrification process, the types of external organic carbons pose significant impacts on the external carbon dosage, nitrogen removal efficiency, denitrifying rates and bio-kinetics (Hallin et al. 1996; Hallin and Pell 1998; Cherchi et al. 2009; Rocher et al. 2015). Such effects could mainly be attributed to that different electron donors (external carbon <b>source)</b> <b>lead</b> to different denitrifying microbial ecosystems (Guven 2009; Lu et al. 2014).

40|$|SummaryDecision {{making in}} superorganisms such as honey bee colonies often uses {{self-organizing}} behaviors, feedback loops {{that allow the}} colony to gather information from multiple individuals and achieve reliable and agile solutions. Honey bees use positive feedback from the waggle dance to allocate colony foraging effort. However, the use of negative feedback signals by superorganisms is poorly understood. I show that conspecific attacks at a food <b>source</b> <b>lead</b> {{to the production of}} stop signals, communication that was known to reduce waggle dancing and recruitment but lacked a clear natural trigger. Signalers preferentially targeted nestmates visiting the same food source, {{on the basis of its}} odor. During aggressive food competition, attack victims increased signal production by 43 fold. Foragers that attacked competitors or experienced no aggression did not alter signal production. Biting ambush predators also attack foragers at flowers. Simulated biting of foragers or exposure to bee alarm pheromone also elicited signaling (88 -fold and 14 -fold increases, respectively). This provides the first clear evidence of a negative feedback signal elicited by foraging peril to counteract the positive feedback of the waggle dance. As in intra- and intercellular communication, negative feedback may play an important, though currently underappreciated, role in self-organizing behaviors within superorganisms...|$|E
