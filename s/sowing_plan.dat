40|$|Climate {{change is}} the main topic in the broad {{scientific}} community for its natural, social and economical consequences {{and its impact on}} human lives. The global carbon cycle is a major component in these problems. High rates of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions have been partly restrained by terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding carbon flows and mechanisms in different land use is essential for mitigation of further changes. This diploma thesis applies soil organic matter model RothC- 26. 3 to simulate the effect of awaited climate change on two agricultural sites in the Czech Republic - Ruzyně and Lukavec, from 1990 until 2065. Simulations were executed for three sowing plans: traditional Norfolk, canola cultivation and change from agricultural land to a grassland. In Ruzyně, the accumulation of total on-site carbon was observed in all these three sowing plans for the whole time period. In Lukavec, the Norfolk <b>sowing</b> <b>plan</b> showed a slight loss of carbon, the carbon in the canola <b>sowing</b> <b>plan</b> stagnated and in the land-use change case the carbon rose. The main difference between the sites is the clay content percentage, however, clay is not responsible for such a difference between the sites. There was not much comparison between measured and modelled data as yet; this is planned to be done in further research to [...] .

Maximum attention must {{be paid to the}} selection of sunflower sowing areas, because of the possibilities of spreading of some infection agents through infected plant waste. Overgrowing of areas on which sunflower <b>sowing</b> is <b>planned</b> {{must be taken into account}} since for some weed there aren’t enough quality solutions and often on some areas crop collection has been cancelled owing to strong overgrowing. In moist years various diseases, that can significantly reduce takings, especially when measures of fungicide protection are not carried out, present a serious problem.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{describe}} and sum up the risk of an increased occurrence of maize in a <b>sowing</b> <b>plan</b> at BUREŠ farm in Švábenice in Vyškov area. The sum of effective temperature (SET) was calculated for the period between 1 st January 2014 and the first appearance of western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera). The temperature was measured in 0, 3 m, 2 m and in the effective height using HOBO sensors. The data from a multi-purpose station from Teranos ALA network located at the farm and from the nearest meteorological station in Ivanovice na Hané was processed. Then the SET was calculated for lower threshold temperature development 5 and 10 degrees. The figures were interpreted {{and can be used}} to predict the occurrence of the corn rootworm in next years...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{compaction}} {{occurs when}} soil particles are pressed together, thus reducing pore spaces between them. Compaction {{is caused by}} the use of heavy machinery, pressure from wheels, tillage equipment, trampling by animals reduced use of organic matter, frequent use of chemical fertilizers and ploughing at the same depth for many years. The signs of soil: Slow plant emergence, thin stands, uneven early growth, small grain heads, abnormal rooting patterns and reduced nutrients offtake can be a reflection of compation. Excessive soil compaction impedes root growth and therefore limits the amount of soil explored by roots. Soil compaction is a problem of global concern and very few have worked on this issue in Pakistan. Therefore this research work was conducted to investigate and document the deleterious effects of subsurface soil compaction on crop and soil properties, as well as to evaluate best and cheap improvement measures for reducing subsurface soil compaction Two field experiments were conducted during the year 2002 - 03 and repeated during the year 2003 - 04 at the Agriculture Research Station, Mingora, Pakistan. In first experiment the effects of subsurface soil compaction were studied. In second experiment the effects of improvement measures applied to the artificially compated subsurface soil were investigated. In first experiment, the 0. 1 m surface horizon was removed from all the plots with the help of scraper. The subsurface was compated using 7. 0 tons roller. The number of passes of roller measured the level of compation. The experiment consisted of four treatments. The subsurface soil was compacted with two passes of roller in T 1, four passes of roller in T 2 and six passes of roller in T 3, while no compaction was applied to T 4 (control). The topsoil was evenly applied to the whole plot and wheat variety Fakhri Sarhad was grown. In second experiment, the 0. 1 meter surface soil was removed with a scrper. Different improvement measures were applied to subplots according to <b>sowing</b> <b>plan.</b> The experiment consisted of five treatments. T 1 received deep ploughing (D. P), T 2 received D. P+FYM at 14000 kg/ja, T 3 received D. P+Gypsum at 4000 kg/ha, T 4 received D. P +FYM+Gypsum at the rates mentioned above while T 5 (control) no addition of improvement measure was made. The subsurface of the whole plot was then compacted with 4 passes of a 7. 0 tons roller. The 0. 1 m surface soil was uniformly distributed in the plot with blade mounted tractor and scraper. Lay out was again carried out and deep ploughing was given to all the sub plots with chisel plough to a depth of 20 cm except control. Wheat variety Fakhri Sarhad was frown in all the plots with a seeding rate of 140 kg/ha- 1 In first experiment compaction of the subsurface significantly affected days to anthesis, days to maturity, plant height spikes m- 2, grains per spike, thousand grain weight, biological yield, grain yield, harvest index, crop growth rate (CGR), root length, subsurface soil bulk density, subsurface soil porosity, percent grain protein, N concentration in plants (...|$|E
50|$|The first {{evidence}} of plant domestication comes from emmer and einkorn wheat found in pre-Pottery Neolithic A villages in Southwest Asia dated about 10,500 to 10,100 BC. The Fertile Crescent of Western Asia, Egypt, and India were {{sites of the}} earliest <b>planned</b> <b>sowing</b> and harvesting of plants {{that had previously been}} gathered in the wild. Independent development of agriculture occurred in northern and southern China, Africa's Sahel, New Guinea and several regions of the Americas. The eight Neolithic founder crops (emmer wheat, einkorn wheat, barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax) had all appeared by about 7000 BC. Horticulture first appears in the Levant during the Chalcolithic period about 6 800 to 6,300 BC. Due to the soft tissues, archeological evidence for early vegetables is scarce. The earliest vegetable remains have been found in Egyptian caves that date back to the 2nd millennium BC.|$|R
40|$|This paper compares two {{previously}} established meteorological modelling methods when determining {{areas in}} Western Australia (WA) where conditions are favourable for infection of wheat (Triticum aestivum) by Tilletia indica, {{the cause of}} Karnal bunt. There was a strong correlation (r = 0. 83) between the Humid Thermal Index (HTI) model, which used long-term, average-monthly data, and the rainfall model, {{which was based on}} the per cent chance of at least three Suitable Rain Events (SRE) during the susceptible period (August to October). Results suggest that northern wheat growing areas are too hot and dry (HTI 3, chance of SRE 68 - 97 %), eastern areas are marginal to too hot and dry (HTI around 2. 2, chance of SRE 24 - 50 %), and western areas are suitable (HTI between 2. 2 and 3. 3, chance of SRE 41 - 78 %). The between and within year analysis indicated that infection was more likely to occur if anthesis occurred in northern areas in August, in October in southern areas, in September in eastern areas, and in August, September, and October in western and south-eastern areas. Model results suggest that data on HTI and SRE within each year may be more accurate in determining climatic suitability for Karnal bunt in WA, compared to long-term, average data. In the event that T. indica does successfully enter WA, {{it may be possible to}} limit spread of Karnal bunt through carefully <b>planned</b> <b>sowing</b> schedules...|$|R
