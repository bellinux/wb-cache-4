50|$|The <b>black-throated</b> <b>finch</b> (Poephila cincta), or parson finch, is {{a species}} of estrildid finch found in grassy {{woodlands}} throughout north-east Australia from Cape York Peninsula to north-east New South Wales. It is declining and its habitat is threatened by development.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Black-throated</b> <b>Finch</b> (<b>Southern)</b> (Poephila cincta cincta) is {{threatened}} by the substantial landscape changes in northern Australia. We developed 16 polymorphic microsatellite markers using 454 -shotgun whole-genome sequencing technology. We identified an average of 4. 7 alleles per locus based on 63 wild caught individuals from Townsville, Queensland. Thirteen and 9 markers were also successfully cross-amplified in two confamilial species, the Double-barred Finch (Taeniopygia bichenovii) and the chestnut-breasted Mannikin (Lonchura castaneothorax) with 11 and 5 were polymorphic, respectively. These markers will help understand the population genetic structure of the endangered <b>Black-throated</b> <b>Finch</b> and determine genetic consequences of landscape changes for the species.

50|$|A genetic study {{published}} in 2005 showed that the two subspecies of the long-tailed finch were separated from each other by the Kimberley Plateau-Arnhem Land Barrier around 340,000 years ago, and their ancestors diverged from the <b>black-throated</b> <b>finch</b> (P. cincta) across the Carpentarian Barrier 600 thousand years ago.|$|R

40|$|Where {{threatened}} biodiversity is {{adversely affected}} by development, policies often state that "no net loss" should be the goal and biodiversity offsetting is one mechanism available to achieve this. However, developments are often approved on an ad hoc basis and cumulative impacts are not sufficiently examined. We demonstrate the potential for serious threat to an endangered subspecies when multiple developments are planned. We modelled {{the distribution of the}} <b>black-throated</b> <b>finch</b> (Poephila cincta cincta) using bioclimatic data and Queensland's Regional Ecosystem classification. We overlaid granted, extant extractive and exploratory mining tenures within the known and modelled ranges of <b>black-throated</b> <b>finches</b> to examine the level of incipient threat to this subspecies in central Queensland, Australia. Our models indicate {{that more than half of}} the remaining P. cincta cincta habitat is currently under extractive or exploratory tenure. Therefore, insufficient habitat exists to offset all potential development so "no net loss" is not possible. This has implications for future conservation of this and similarly distributed species and for resource development planning, especially the use of legislated offsets for biodiversity protection...|$|R

50|$|The {{total number}} of species {{recorded}} on Bird Island in November 1998 was 27, of which 25 bred or were probably breeding. Macaroni penguin, ruddy-headed goose, canary-winged <b>finch,</b> <b>black-throated</b> <b>finch</b> and Falkland steamer duck are present but their status is uncertain or populations {{are too small to}} qualify. The congregation of seabirds on this island exceeds 10,000 breeding pairs, making the site classifiable under the A4iii criterion. Bird Island {{is one of the most}} important breeding sites for the striated caracara and it is considered that the population here is at least as dense as on any offshore island around the Falklands, possibly due to the very large population of thin-billed prions, an important prey species.|$|R

40|$|Conservation {{agencies}} are often {{faced with the}} difficult task of prioritizing what recovery actions receive support. With the number of species under threat of decline growing globally, research that informs conservation priorities is greatly needed. The relative vulnerability of cryptic or nomadic species is often uncertain, because populations are difficult to monitor and local populations often seem stable in the short term. This uncertainty can lead to inaction when populations are in need of protection. We tested the feasibility of using differences in condition indices as an indication of population vulnerability to decline for related threatened Australian finch sub-species. The Gouldian finch represents a relatively well-studied endangered species, which has a seasonal and site-specific pattern of condition index variation that differs from the closely related non-declining long-tailed finch. We used Gouldian and long-tailed finch condition variation as a model to compare with lesser studied, threatened star and <b>black-throated</b> <b>finches.</b> We compared body condition (fat and muscle scores), haematocrit and stress levels (corticosterone) among populations, seasons and years to determine whether lesser studied finch populations matched the model of an endangered species or a non-declining species. While vulnerable finch populations often had lower muscle and higher fat and corticosterone concentrations during moult (seasonal pattern similar to Gouldian finches), haematocrit values did not differ among populations in a predictable way. Star and <b>black-throated</b> <b>finch</b> populations, which were predicted to be vulnerable to decline, showed evidence of poor condition during moult, supporting their status as vulnerable. Our findings highlight how measures of condition can provide insight into the relative vulnerability of animal and plant populations to decline and will allow the prioritization of efforts towards the populations most likely to be in jeopardy of extinction...|$|R

40|$|Landscape {{genetics}} investigates {{relationships between}} population processes and landscape structure. I use {{this approach to}} understand the role of specific landscape features and environmental conditions in affecting population connectivity, gene flow and movements of a threatened species. The <b>Black-throated</b> <b>Finch,</b> both northern (Poephila cincta atropygialis) and southern subspecies (P. c. cincta), has subjected to many threatening processes over the last decade, especially the southern form. The decline of P. c. cincta {{is believed to be}} primarily due to overgrazing of riparian grassland, clearing and habitat fragmentation. The genetic consequence of the decline is unknown. I use molecular data to identify population structure; to quantify gene flow between remnant populations; and to understand how these dynamics are related to landscape features. With the analysis of landscape genetics, I can understand the extent of genetic impacts from environmental disturbance, the way in which birds use landscapes, and how viable and differentiate the existing populations are...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Australia’s savanna is still a highly {{connected}} landscape dominated by native vegetation, {{over a quarter of}} Australia’s granivorous birds have declined in abundance or experienced range contractions over the last fifty years. It is widely assumed that cattle grazing and changed fire regimes have lowered the quality of savanna habitats for grass-seed eating species by lowering the productivity of important grasses. However, the relative impacts of changed land use on granivores such as finches remains poorly defined because of difficulties in monitoring the abundance of these semi-nomadic birds in remote areas. Consequently, my study compares the health measures of finch populations to determine if the timing and severity of changes in health indicators coincide with differing land management. The relative number of unhealthy animals can indicate a population’s probability of decline, as sick or chronically stressed individuals are less likely to survive and breed. I monitored a variety of finch species in order to describe relative granivore responses to land management. Declining species are characterized by specialized diets, prolonged breeding seasons and strictly timed moulting periods, while non-declining species have opportunistic feeding, breeding and moult strategies which could aid them in responding to the seasonal savanna environment and recent habitat changes in Northern Australia. This led me to hypothesize that health patterns would differ between these species seasonally. Therefore I monitored finches during the peak breeding season, when food resources are plentiful just after the wet growing season, and again in the non-breeding season, when grass seeds become scarce, and most finches are moulting. Based on the theory that grazing and burning lowers the quality of finch habitat, I also hypothesized that finches would show differences in health between populations living in areas of differing land management. Finches were monitored for two years in three study areas in the Northern Territory and three in Queensland; one site per state was conservation managed (without grazing and fire), one was pastoral (grazed but without fire), and one was aboriginal (with frequent burning, but without high grazing). The health of declining Gouldian finches and non-declining Long-tailed and Masked finches were monitored in the Northern Territory while declining Star and <b>Black-throated</b> <b>finches</b> were monitored in Queensland. Health indices included body condition measures (body mass, fat stores and muscle contour), haematocrit and stress response to capture using plasma corticosterone (CORT) and binding globulin levels. Finch habitat was surveyed in the Northern Territory in order to describe any differences in the grass layer in response to grazing or fire and among land tenures. Health monitoring results suggest that all finch species have better body condition during breeding seasons and declining species have a possible pattern of chronic stress during non-breeding seasons. All finch species had higher body mass and muscle scores and lower fat stores during breeding compared to non-breeding. Measures of CORT showed that Gouldian, Star, and <b>Black-throated</b> <b>finches</b> have stress response patterns opposite to that seen in most passerine studies; low stress responses during breeding and high stress during non-breeding. This pattern suggests that declining species are experiencing chronic stress during non-breeding, possibly due to low food resource availability during this time of year. Non-declining Long-tailed and Masked finches had a normal stress response pattern, opposite to declining species. High stress, low body condition and unusually high haematocrit were found in Gouldian finches monitored on pastoral land during a non-breeding season. Gouldian finches surveyed on aboriginal land during this season also had lowered body condition and unusually high haematocrit compared to birds sampled on conservation land. Habitat surveys showed that annual grass cover was low on pastoral land and perennial grass cover and productivity was low on aboriginal land compared to conservation managed land. These low grass measures coincided with the poor health of Gouldian finches on pastoral and aboriginal land, suggesting lowered grass abundance as a likely cause of poor <b>finch</b> health. Though <b>Black-throated</b> <b>finch</b> body condition and haematocrit were similar between land tenures, stress responses were higher on pastoral land compared to conservation managed land during the non-breeding season in 2007. This suggests that <b>Black-throated</b> <b>finches</b> may be sensitive to grazing effects during some years. Star Finches monitored in open grasslands tended to have higher haematocrit levels, suggesting a lifestyle with higher energy demands. No consistent {{significant differences were found between}} the health measures of Long-tailed or Masked finches sampled on different land tenures. ix The results of this study suggest that tropical finch species have seasonal health variation which implies poorer condition during non-breeding compared to breeding seasons and a possible pattern of chronic stress in three declining species. This supports my hypothesis that declining species are more sensitive to seasonal changes. Coinciding differences in finch health, land tenure and grass cover estimates suggest that non-conservation management adversely affects finch health and grasses important to finches. This was particularly evident for the declining Gouldian finch and indicates a probability of future finch population declines on non-conservation managed land. Thus this research provides evidence of the threat of intensification of pastoral practices and continued frequent burning to declining savanna species. This study also reveals the utility of using health indices to determine the sensitivity of birds to environmental perturbations...|$|R
5|$|Males’ {{differential}} {{recognition of}} local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations: one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) {{and the other in}} the southern United States (North Carolina). An asymmetry of response has been found between the two populations. The northern black-throated blue warbler responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly to the song of southern warblers. In contrast, a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the north and the south. A potential explanation of this asymmetry is the difference in female preference between the northern and <b>southern</b> <b>black-throated</b> blue warblers. Females from the north are less likely to mate with a “heterospecific” male from the south; therefore it is not necessary for a northern male to respond strongly to the song of a southern challenger. It is possible that a barrier to gene flow from south to north exists while a barrier to the reverse does not. Therefore, female choice of male songs is likely {{to play a role in}} gene flow and reproductive isolation, which may eventually lead to diversification.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{movement}} patterns and home range of species is paramount in ecology; {{it is particularly}} important for threatened taxa {{as it can provide}} valuable information for conservation management. To address this knowledge gap for a range-restricted endangered bird, we estimated home range size, daily {{movement patterns}} and habitat use of a granivorous subspecies in northeast Australia, the <b>black-throated</b> <b>finch</b> (Poephila cincta cincta; BTF) using radio-tracking and re-sighting of colour banded birds. Little is known about basic aspects of its ecology including movement patterns and home range sizes. From 2011 - 2014 we colour-banded 102 BTF and radio-tracked 15 birds. We generated home ranges (calculated using kernel and Minimum Convex Polygons techniques of the 15 tracked BTF). More than 50 % of the re-sightings occurred within 200 m of the banding site (n = 51 out of 93 events) and within 100 days of capture. Mean home-range estimates with kernel (50 %, 95 % probability) and Minimum Convex Polygons were 10. 59 ha, 50. 79 ha and 46. 27 ha, respectively. Home range size differed between two capture sites but no seasonal differences were observed. BTF home ranges overlapped four habitat types among eight available. Habitat selection was different from random at Site 1 (χ 2 = 373. 41, df = 42, p< 0. 001) and Site 2 (χ 2 = 1896. 1, df = 45, p< 0. 001); however, the preferred habitats differed between the two sites. BTF moved further than expected on the basis of current knowledge, with three individuals being resighted over 15 km from the banding location. However, BTF maintain small home ranges over short time-frames. Occasional long-distance movements may be related to resource bottleneck periods. Daily movement patterns differed between sites, which is likely linked {{to the fact that the}} sites differ in the spatial distribution of resources. The work provides information about home range sizes and local movement of BTF that will be valuable for targeting effective management and conservation strategies for this endangered granivore...|$|R

40|$|Extract] The Australian Centre for Tropical Freshwater Research (ACTFR), James Cook University of North Queensland, Townsville, {{was engaged}} by the Department of Natural Resources to {{undertake}} a flora and fauna survey of two parcels of land, the Inkerman and Molongle blocks, associated with the potential future development of the Elliott Main Channel. The study area lie within the Brigalow Belt bioregion, a large and complex area that encompasses much of the 500 - 750 mm per annum rainfall country from the Queensland-New South Wales border to Townsville. The survey of the Inkerman and Molongle blocks was required, via field survey and literature review, to: identify common and significant flora and fauna species, habitat and communities; identify core and non-core conservation areas including significant communities, wildlife corridors or other areas of value requiring protection or careful management; and provide recommendations for the future sustainable management of the study areas. The vegetation survey identified a rare grass species, (POACEAE Dichanthium setosum) in the understorey of vegetation type Melaleuca spp., Corymbia tessellarisand vine thicket species on creek banks (Inkerman community description 7 and Molongle 5 a community description 5). In addition, four plant species collected were new records for the North Kennedy region: Malvaceae Abelmoschus moschatus; Marsileaceae Marsilea drummondii; Poaceae Sporobolus disjunctus; and Combretaceae Terminalia platyphylla. A total of 15 broad vegetation types were recorded from the study areas: in Molongle 5 a, six vegetation types, five of which were of bioregional conservation status and four of provincial (moderate to high) conservation significance; Molongle 5 b, eight vegetation types, three of which were of bioregional conservation status and seven of provincial (moderateto very high) conservation significance; and in Inkerman, eleven vegetation types, six of which were of bioregional conservation status and four of provincial conservation significnace. The vertebrate fauna survey recorded a total of 138 vertebrate fauna species, comprising of 24 mammal species, 101 bird species, 6 amphibian species and 7 reptile species were recorded during the field survey. In addition, 41 specimens (comprising 14 mammals, 16 birds, 1 amphibians, 10 reptiles) were identified for the areas from the Queensland Museum database {{and a total of}} 392 species (292 birds, 56 mammals, 34 reptiles and 10 amphibians) for the Lower Burdekin Region from literature sources. From the field survey and a review of secondary sources 13 species of conservation significance were identified for the Inkerman and Molongle areas: Northern Quoll Dasyurus hallucatus; Squirrel Glider Petaurus norfolcensis; Greater Glider Petauroides volans; Spectacled hare-wallaby Lagorchestes conspicillatus; Koala Phascolarctus cinereus; Bare-rumped Sheath-tailed BatSaccolaimus saccolaimus; Red Goshawk Erythrotriorchis radiatus; Square-tailed Kite Lophoictinia isura; Black-chinned Honeyeater Melithreptus gularis; <b>Black-throated</b> <b>Finch</b> Poephila cincta cincta; Ground Cuckoo-shrike Coracina maxima; Squatter Pigeon (southern subspecies) Geophaps scripta scripta; and Rufous Owl (eastern subsp.) Ninox rufa queenslandica. The report recommends that any future development in these areas associated with the extension of the Elliott Main Channel should incorporate a reserve systems that: •protects all 'endangered' regional ecosystems and a proportion of those that are 'of concern' that maximises their representation; •represents the diversity of regional ecosystems and vegetation types in the area and should also include portions of those regional ecosystems of 'no concern at present' and examples of all significant habitat types; that is connected to larger areas of more intact vegetation and habitat outside the development blocks; •has at least one continuous link from coastal to upland areas to act as a wildlife corridor; •is of a viable size that will again prevent its susceptibility to degradation via stochastic events and support in itself a stable fauna assemblage. In addition, the following recommendations were made in regards to the sustainable management of the study area for nature conservation: •develop and implement clear guidelines for the management and monitoring of these reserves such a new or pre-existing Environmental Management Plan; •consider the prospect of rehabilitation of degraded sites within the study area, particularly if some sites of conservation significance will be degraded or disturbed {{as a consequence of the}} Elliott Main Channel extension; •develop complementary community education programs to educate of local land-owners and community members as to the values and importance of conservation reserves in their local area; and •develop of long-term monitoring programs examining the viability and functioning of flora and fauna communities, together with an assessment of the effectiveness of environmental management guidelines, within any reserve systems...|$|R
