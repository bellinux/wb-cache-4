5|$|Gilbert's final {{disposition}} of the libretto came in 1911, when it {{was included in the}} fourth volume of his Original Plays. However, Gilbert died before he could correct proofs for that edition, and so it reprinted the 1871 text, correcting only a few <b>spelling</b> <b>mistakes.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1875, a {{detailed}} {{list of all}} passengers and crew was published by J.H. Lewis, Printer & Publisher, albeit with several errors and <b>spelling</b> <b>mistakes.</b> That document {{was used as the}} main source of the following survivors' table.|$|E
5|$|In mid-December 1982 {{the author}} and future Holocaust denier David Irving was also {{involved}} in tracking the existence of diaries written by Hitler. Priesack had previously told Irving {{of the existence of}} one of the diaries with a collector in Stuttgart. In a visit to Priesack to assess his collection of Nazi documents, Irving found out Stiefel's phone number, from which he worked out the address; he also obtained photocopies of some of the diary pages from Priesack. Irving visited Stiefel unannounced and tried to find out the name of the source, but the collector misled him as to the origin. Irving examined Priesack's photocopies and saw a number of problems, including <b>spelling</b> <b>mistakes</b> and the change in writing style between certain words.|$|E

25|$|Neither Pliny's nor Ptolemy's {{lists of}} Scandinavian tribes include the Suiones {{mentioned}} by Tacitus. Some early Swedish scholars of the Swedish Hyperborean school {{and of the}} 19th-century romantic nationalism period proceeded to synthesize the different versions by inserting references to the Suiones, arguing that {{they must have been}} referred to in the original texts and obscured over time by <b>spelling</b> <b>mistakes</b> or various alterations.|$|E
25|$|However, a Commission of Enquiry, which Parnell had requested, {{revealed}} in February 1889 after 128 sessions that {{the letters were}} a fabrication created by Richard Pigott, a disreputable anti-Parnellite rogue journalist. Pigott broke down under cross-examination after the letter was {{shown to be a}} forgery by him with his characteristic <b>spelling</b> <b>mistakes.</b> He fled to Madrid where he committed suicide. Parnell was vindicated, to the disappointment of the Tories and the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury.|$|E

500|$|The Bermúdez {{album was}} {{borrowed}} by the Academy for the 1863 edition. The original titles or captions were etched onto the plates, even with Goya's <b>spelling</b> <b>mistakes.</b> One title was changed, one plate had work added, and the printing {{was carried out}} with much more ink on the plates (producing [...] "surface tone") than in the proofs, in accordance with mid-century taste. The Bermúdez set is considered [...] "uniquely important... because it shows the series as Goya must have intended to publish it, {{and the way he}} intended the plates to be printed". There is therefore a distinction between the published edition of 1863, with 80 plates, and the full series in the album, which contains 82 (ignoring the three small Prisioneros).|$|E
500|$|The {{stress and}} {{uncertainty}} of captivity took {{their toll on}} Anastasia {{as well as her}} family. [...] "Goodby [...] ", she wrote to a friend in the winter of 1917.

500|$|Neal Chandran at RPGFan called Ever 17 [...] "a fantastic {{adventure}} game", {{and one of}} {{the best}} Japanese games in the genre that are available in English, describing it as a [...] "must-play". He liked the game's writing, finding the conversations with other characters to be deep, philosophical, and intellectual, and said that each character was interesting. He found the conversations to reading [...] "like conversation should", but also found the English localization to contain multiple flaws, including <b>spelling</b> <b>mistakes</b> and grammatical errors, such as the misuse of the words [...] "your" [...] and [...] "you're". Jason Young at GameZone called the game an [...] "all-age masterpiece [...] is nearly flawless in every regard", and said that it was the best visual novel that was available in English. He said that it was one of the video games with the best characterization in history, and called the game's plot twist [...] "mind-blowing".|$|E

500|$|Boosinger {{said that}} while the game retains the comedy of the Ace Attorney series and has great {{character}} writing, he found the story to be dull, slow, and too long. Ronaghan called the dialogue funny, and said that the game was well-paced, long, and enjoyable. Goldstein called the story interesting, but said that it at times plays out [...] "like a bad soap opera". Walker appreciated the choice to make Edgeworth the game's lead character, and called Kay a fantastic addition. He found the translation of the game to be incredible, despite a number of <b>spelling</b> <b>mistakes.</b> Hopper appreciated that the game has a new protagonist and setting, and called the dialogue [...] "cheesy but charming". On the other hand, he said {{that there is a lot}} of superfluous text in the game, making the cases longer than they need to be. Parker said that it takes some time to get used to playing as Edgeworth, saying that he is not as immediately engaging as Phoenix and Apollo. She called the story deep and intricate, and slow but solid. Ronaghan called the art style and presentation wonderful, and said that each character [...] "oozes with personality", but that the animation, while better than that in previous titles, was limited to only a few frames at a time. Goldstein called the characters colorful, but found the locations to be uninteresting. Hopper called the game's aesthetic [...] "anime-esque" [...] and clean, and said that the static images were decent. Parker liked the game's presentation, and called the environments [...] "beautifully drawn".|$|E

2500|$|Several {{slightly}} different renderings {{of the original}} version, , have been published, some with older spellings modernised and so on. The very first version published had some errors. In addition to <b>spelling</b> <b>mistakes</b> ("imbasor" [...] for [...] "invasor" [...] in the printed version, but not the manuscript), an error that was particularly unfortunate in light of later conflicts was [...] "Buenos--Ayres se opone a la frente de los pueblos ..." [...] in the manuscript instead of [...] "... se pone ..."; [...] "Buenos Aires opposes {{the front of the}} peoples" [...] instead of [...] "Buenos Aires puts itself {{at the front of the}} peoples". A [...] "corrected" [...] original version bearing the same date of 14 May 1813 (still with some clear errors, such as sonóro, cien for temples of the head, and inconsistencies such as both alas and álas) is transcribed below, as printed.|$|E

2500|$|The song {{includes}} {{a line that}} {{has given rise to}} controversy: Buenos--Ayres se pone á la frente De los pueblos de la ínclita union. In the manuscript and an early printed song-sheet the word opone is used; a slightly later version of the song-sheet correcting obvious errors such as <b>spelling</b> <b>mistakes</b> was issued with the same date of 14 May 1813, but with opone changed to pone. The meaning reverses: [...] "Buenos Aires opposes the front {{of the people of the}} union" [...] to [...] "Buenos Aires positions itself at the front ...". The original opone [...] has been interpreted as advancing part of the centralist views in Buenos Aires, but has also been considered a [...] "tragical misprint". In many other lines the anthem goes beyond the Argentine theater of the Spanish American wars of independence and references events in Mexico, Central America, Northern South America, and Upper Peru. The growing ideas of independence are reflected in lines such as [...] "On the surface of the earth rises a glorious new nation, her head is crowned with laurels, and a Lion lies defeated at her feet". This portrays not just Spanish absolutism, but Spain itself, as the enemy.|$|E
2500|$|When John Hill filed his wife's last {{will and}} {{testament}} {{shortly after her}} death, Ash Robinson quickly produced another will, which he said had been written at the time Joan was separated from Hill. The will made Robinson her executor, left everything to him, and asked that Robinson and his wife have custody of the Hills' son, Robert. It was signed by two of Robinson's friends, one a former employee. Hill believed the will to be a forgery and hired three handwriting experts to attest to that fact. Thompson observes that Robinson Hill's signature was different to that in a previous will, and that the will had been [...] "clumsily typed, replete with <b>spelling</b> <b>mistakes</b> and language more likely to be used by someone imitating legal terminology". Hill asked the District Attorney's office to investigate, but Cecil Haden, who was serving on the grand jury at the time, suggested the matter be dealt with once the issue of Robinson Hill's death had been addressed. Robert Hill contested the will in 1978, claiming that it was a forgery, but a probate jury found in favor of Robinson.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1999 at {{the height}} of Emin's Turner Prize fame, she created a number of monoprint {{drawings}} inspired by the public and private life of Princess Diana for a themed exhibition called Temple of Diana held at The Blue Gallery, London. Works such as They Wanted You To Be Destroyed (1999) related to Princess Diana's bulimia eating disorder, while other monoprints included affectionate texts such as Love Was on Your Side and a description of Princess Diana's dress with puffy sleeves. Other drawings highlighted The things you did to help other people written next to a drawing by Emin of Diana, Princess of Wales in protective clothing walking through a minefield in Angola. Another work was a delicate sketch of a rose drawn next to the phrase [...] "It makes perfect sence to know they killed you" [...] (with Emin's trademark <b>spelling</b> <b>mistakes)</b> referring to the conspiracy theories surrounding Princess Diana's death. Emin herself described the drawings, saying they [...] "could be considered quite scrappy, fresh, kind of naive looking drawings" [...] and [...] "It's pretty difficult for me to do drawings not about me and about someone else. But I have did have a lot of ideas. They're quite sentimental I think and there's nothing cynical about it whatsoever." ...|$|E

After that, Inspiration came to me regularly. I wrote the whole of 'Humble Heroisms' like that. It was a great success, and so has everything been that I have written since."
