6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Harry, [...] "we've {{seen the}} schooner, a boat, and a fire upon the beach, but, after all, that's {{not a great}} deal to go upon. We want to make <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> putting ashore." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was still}} as if, for an instant, Milly {{had to be}} <b>sure</b> of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant; but there it {{presently}} was. [...] "If she did care Mrs. Condrip would have told me." ...|$|R
60|$|Master Busy up aloft {{was quite}} <b>sure</b> that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> heard {{was a few}} sheep and cattle of Sir Marmaduke's who were out to grass in a field close by, and had been scared into a canter.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Sabin {{regarded}} her with some faint indication of surprise. He was not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant. Did she expect {{a reward for}} her warning, he wondered. Her words would seem to indicate something of the sort, and yet he was not sure.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's how she was. You {{could never}} be <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{would be up to}} next. There are ships {{difficult}} to handle, but generally you can depend on them behaving rationally. With that ship, whatever you did with her you never knew how it would end. She was a wicked beast. Or, perhaps, she was only just insane." ...|$|E

60|$|Alora did {{not reply}} to that. She was eager to begin packing and hurried through her breakfast. All the things she might need on a journey she put into one trunk. She was not quite <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> ought to take, and her father was still more ignorant {{concerning}} a little girl's wardrobe, but finally both trunks were packed and locked and then Mr. Jones called a wagon and carted away the extra trunk of Alora's and several boxes of his own to be deposited in a storage warehouse.|$|E
6000|$|She was by {{no means}} <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was going to do; she had hoped there would be some leading on his part that would make it easy for her to do right, {{whatever}} the right was, but her heart sank at sight of him. He looked defeated and harassed. But there was no help for it. She must speak, and speak unaided; the only question was whether she had better speak before dinner or after. She decided to speak after dinner, and then all at once she was saying: [...] "Brice, I have brought something dreadful on myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, I {{was over}} to her place two, tree times," [...] began Juan, {{brightening}} with each word. [...] "I drive en to many horse to her ranch.

6000|$|Old Granny Fox {{smiled to}} think <b>what</b> a fright <b>she</b> had had and then,--well, she didn't {{know whether she}} was really awake or still dreaming! No, Sir, she didn't.

6000|$|... "I don't suppose I {{shall have}} above twenty pounds left when we've sold up—but she's {{got plenty of}} money to start with—if she has me—in Canada. I could get well off—and she could have—what she wanted—I'm <b>sure</b> she'd have <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted." ...|$|R
60|$|Bellairs {{promised to}} call Ethel, {{to be with}} her young lady as early as might be, {{reporting}} that she was sound asleep. And sleep continued to shield her till past her usual hour, so that Ethel was up, and had been with Dr. May, before she was summoned to her, and then she found her half dressed, and hastening that she might not make Dr. May late for breakfast, and in going to his patients. There was an elasticity in the happily constituted young mind that could not be entirely struck down, nor deprived of power of taking thought for others. Yet her eyes looked wandering, and unlike themselves, and her words, now and then, faltered, as if she was not <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing or saying. Ethel told her not to mind--Dr. Spencer would take care of the patients; but she did not seem to recollect, at first, who Dr. Spencer was, nor to care for being reminded.|$|E

She wants to make <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> sees is how it actually appears. Eagle wants her paintings to say [...] "here I am, as I really am." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No more do I, my dear. I've {{spent my}} life in trying, in vain, to discover. Like nothing--more's the pity.

5000|$|Another {{reviewer}} {{wrote about}} the camera work in that film in this way: (In) Patrick Stettner’s The Business of Strangers, you {{learn a lot about}} Julie. She’s on the move, traveling first class, but everywhere she goes looks the same; all the restaurants, boardrooms, and hotel suites feature the same bland décor. As Julie click-clicks through a starkly white airport, Teodoro Maniaci’s camera tracks behind her, then moves around to reveal her game face: prepared and in control. The problem is, she can never be <b>sure</b> just <b>what</b> <b>she’s</b> prepared for and in control of, but that is the precise nature of her business, which is characterized by treachery and tension. Indeed, minutes after Julie’s in-charge intro, things start to go wrong.... Cynthia Fuchs, editor, review at ...|$|R

5000|$|In the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences panel {{discussion}} {{that took place}} between seasons six and seven, Alyson Hannigan revealed that getting the shot of Tara's blood spraying onto Willow's shirt was incredibly difficult. Because they only had two shirts, the wardrobe department kept washing the shirts but {{did not have time}} to dry them, so the shirt was wet in most of the takes. Hannigan joked that when they finally got the take she wasn't <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing acting-wise, she was just concerned with, [...] "Was that blood good? OK, good.

At first Vivian thinks this must be some sort of joke, but she discovers that Reggie is indeed dead, and as she calls her best friend Louise (Paige Turco) to figure out what might have happened and what to do, it occurs to her that she blacked out after too much wine the night before and isn't <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did before she passed out.
