500|$|Each puppet's {{head was}} fitted with about 10 thin {{tungsten}} steel wires. During the filming, dialogue was played {{into the studio}} using modified tape recorders that converted the feed into electronic pulses. Two of the wires relayed these pulses to the internal solenoid, completing the Supermarionation process. The wires, which were sprayed black to reduce their visibility, were made even less noticeable {{through the application of}} powder paint that matched the background colours of the set. Glanville explained the time-consuming nature of this process: [...] " [...] used to spend over half an hour on each shot getting rid of these wires, looking through the camera, puffing a bit more [...] here, anti-flare there; and, I mean, it's very depressing when somebody will <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> 'Of course the wires showed.'" [...] Positioned on an overhead gantry with a hand-held cruciform, the puppeteers co-ordinated movements {{with the help of a}} viewfinder-powered CCTV feedback system. As filming progressed, the crew started to dispense with wires and instead manipulate the puppets from the studio floor using rods.|$|E

6000|$|Major Clarke was {{the only}} member of all that company who knew we were to set out at this time, and he {{remained}} in close conversation with Simon Kenton a good half hour after Paul and I had taken our places in the dugout.

6000|$|The face of {{external}} nature teaches the same lesson. Nature {{will not have}} us fret and fume. She does not like our benevolence or our learning much better than she likes our frauds and wars.

A movie about faith and forgiveness, There Be Dragons is a project that Joffé says has a message he's proud <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on film.

5000|$|French poet Guy Allix {{said about}} Barron's poetry: [...] " [...] To born is {{to arrive late}} already [...] ", Néstor <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in a desperation taken with courage of fully assumed man. There is in this poetry {{something}} radical and rough that, beyond the distresses of an epoch, plunges in our more secret and more terrible depths and seems to find there, paradoxically, an antidote against the pain of living, an indomitable energy. This shows a way without complacency, a way of real bravery in these times of widespread resignation.|$|R

6000|$|I {{am quite}} {{aware that they}} do not state their case {{precisely}} in this way.

As we seek to do that we find that Scripture pushes <b>us</b> <b>to</b> apply its teaching to situations of our own time. In this course we will learn how to relate the teachings of God's Word to the situations we face in contemporary ministry, including new developments in culture, philosophy and models of ministry. We will also assess what the Reformed tradition <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> as we carry the Gospel to people today...|$|R
