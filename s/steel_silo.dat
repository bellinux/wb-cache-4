40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the finite element modeling of the experiments on cone-cylinder-skirt-ring transition junctions in steel silos under simulated bulk solid loading presented in the companion paper. Before presenting the finite element results, the issue of modeling the interaction between the stored solid and the shell wall throughout the loading process is first examined. Results from nonlinear bifurcation analyses using the perfect shapes and nonlinear analyses using the measured imperfect shapes are then presented and compared with the experimental results. These comparisons show that despite the structural complexity of <b>steel</b> <b>silo</b> transition junctions, their behavior can be satisfactorily predicted by finite element analyses taking into account a number of important factors including geometric imperfections, effects of welding and the interaction between the junction and the stored solid. Next, the paper presents results of nonlinear analyses of these junctions with assumed eigenmode-affine imperfections. These results shed considerable light on the effect of ring buckling on the load-carrying capacity of transition junctions. Finally, the implications of the experimental and finite element results for the design of <b>steel</b> <b>silo</b> transition junctions are discussed.

40|$|Purpose. The work {{sets forth}} the search results of new, more {{efficient}} design solutions for metal silos, namely, {{the analysis of}} existing types of profiles cross-section in a steel wall of such silo and development of less material-intensive section of corrugated profile. Methodology. To achieve the set goal there were researched the existing types of capacitive structure profiles and their strain-stress state under the load. The analysis {{was performed on the}} results of computational experiments. The prototype object was mathematical computer models. The calculations were made using the finite-element method. For computational experiment there was used the design-computing system Structure CAD for Windows. Findings. In this work there were obtained the data allowing to assess work of the profiles and to find more effective type of cross-section in terms of its material consumption. In the process of joint study of the authors a new type of profile for capacitive structures was developed; it has higher utilization efficiency and the attachment point of individual steel sheets with this type of profile. Both solutions are easy to install, reliable in operation and can be manufactured in the conditions of modern industrial production using standard equipment, materials and components. Originality. A new type of corrugated profile cross-section for <b>steel</b> <b>silo</b> walls was proposed; it has higher load carrying capacity and rigidity and allows reducing the metal thickness without changing the structure carrying capacity that results in material consumption reduction of the whole structure. For this and similar types of profiles there was designed and proposed the attachment point of individual corrugated sheets screwed with extending flange, which enables the unit connection in case of small size corrugations, where the distance is not sufficient to accommodate the bolt cap between the individual corrugations. Practical value. Application of the proposed solutions can increase efficiency, manufacturability and maintainability of <b>steel</b> <b>silo</b> wall structures. The results obtained during the research show promise for further development of research on finding new and more economic solutions for corrugated <b>steel</b> <b>silo</b> wall design, as well as other ways to reduce material consumption of bulk material storage structures...|$|E

40|$|Generally, {{the decisive}} design state of locally {{supported}} axially compressed <b>steel</b> <b>silos</b> is buckling. To predict the elasto-plastic buckling load with sufficient accuracy, {{it is recommended}} to replace conservative hand calculations by computer simulations. In this way, the buckling load can be predicted based on the actual stress distribution and stress concentrations in the shell wall {{taking into account the}} effect of imperfections. The latter is of particular importance, since thin-walled shells are extremely prone to small deviations relative to the perfect shell wall. However, to regard the numerical results as sufficiently accurate and reliable, a validated numerical model is required. In this paper, the validation of a shell based FEM model of locally supported <b>steel</b> <b>silos</b> is done by comparing experimental to numerical results. For this, a total of seven experiments were performed on scale models. In these, two configuration types of locally supported <b>steel</b> <b>silos</b> were considered with engaged columns and partial-height U-shaped longitudinal stiffeners, respectively. Geometrically and materially non-linear shell behaviour was used for the numerical simulations, taking into account the measurement of the initial imperfections as measured prior to the experiments and the real stress-strain relationship. A good correspondence is shown between the experimental and numerical results, proving that the numerical model is suitable for the simulation of the failure behaviour of locally supported stiffened steel barrels...|$|R

In steel plants, steel silos are used for the storage of bulk materials. However, steel silos differ principally from their concrete counterparts in physical properties like the high strength per unit weight and ductility. The high yield and ultimate strength result in slender sections. Being ductile the steel structures give sufficient advance warning before failure by way of excessive deformations. <b>Steel</b> <b>silo</b> is elevated and supported by frames.

40|$|The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has a need {{to develop}} and field a {{low-cost}} option for the long-term storage {{of a variety of}} radiological material. The storage option’s primary requirement is to provide both environmental and physical protection of the materials. Design criteria for this effort require a low initial cost and minimum maintenance over a 50 -year design life. In 1999, Argonne National Laboratory-West was tasked with developing a dry silo storage option for the BN- 350 Spent Fuel in Aktau Kazakhstan. Argon’s design consisted of a carbon steel cylinder approximately 16 ft long, 18 in. outside diameter and 0. 375 in. wall thickness. The carbon <b>steel</b> <b>silo</b> was protected from corrosion by a duplex coating system consisting of zinc and epoxy.

In 2012, NNSA tasked Idaho National Laboratory (INL) with reinvestigating the silo storage concept and development of alternative corrosion protection strategies. The 2012 study, “Silo Storage Concepts, Cathodic Protection Options Study” (INL/EST- 12 - 26627), concludes that the option which best fits the design criterion is a passive cathotic protection scheme, consisting of a carbon steel tube coated with zinc or a zinc-aluminum alloy encapsulated in either concrete or a cement grout.
