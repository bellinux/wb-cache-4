40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} <b>Sing</b> <b>Master</b> - a new mobile {{application}} that allows singing enthusiasts {{to fulfill their}} dream: to learn singing. <b>Sing</b> <b>Master</b> is a game-like singing tutor that presents a series of singing exercises focused on musical intervals (e. g. major third). Furthermore, we motivate the use of software to evaluate and teach singing compared to a conventional singing coach. Further, we summarise some very similar software applications and outline what are the benefits of <b>Sing</b> <b>Master</b> compared to them. We finish by describing <b>Sing</b> <b>Master's</b> most useful feature to 'hear' the melody being sung and the algorithm, which 'hears' the musical pitch...|$|R
