40|$|Abstract — The {{stability}} {{and performance of}} visual <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> strongly depend on the delays caused by image processing. In order to accelerate the visual feedback, the distributed computational power across networks and appropriate data transmission mechanism are of particular interest. In this paper, a novel distributed computation with data scheduling is proposed for networked visual <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> (NVSCSs) aiming at improving the control performance. A realtime transport protocol is developed for image data transmission. For a NVSCS which is modeled as a continuous-time system with computation, transmission and holding delays, a switching control law is applied. A probabilistic sampling scheduler is derived such that the control performance and the network load caused by image data transmission are balanced. Experiments on two 1 -DoF linear modules equipped with a camera are conducted to validate the proposed approach. A visual servo system without data scheduling is implemented for comparison. The experimental results demonstrate a comparable control performance of the proposed approach with an advantage of reduced network load. I...|$|R

The engine was cooled by exhaust ejectors, producing an energy saving that increased payload by 800 pounds.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{networked}} visual <b>servo</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> with distributed computation {{is proposed}} {{to overcome the}} low sampling rate problem in vision-based control systems. A real-time image data transmission protocol based on Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP) is developed.

Thus, a high sampling rate of the visual feedback is achieved under a cloud image processing architecture. The varying image processing delay caused by the varying number of extracted features and the random transmission delay are modeled as a random process with Bernoulli distribution.
