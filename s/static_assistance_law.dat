This principle was universal principle, every law country used this principle without any doubt. In our law, there also law certainty principle in order to fulfil human rights and freedom. In Law Judicial Procedure, there is a term stated that “ubi jus ibi remedium” which means where the rights located, there also possibility to get, pursue, or fix it while it was broken. So, in order to guarantee law certainty and protection to human rights as the law dreamed, so that needed several instruments with strong foundation, like law officers, starting from police, prosecutor, judge, and lawyer. This law officers should have a good moral and ethic to form law destination. There still some defendants who didn’t understand their rights in investigation, so that the defendants rejected <b>law</b> <b>assistance</b> who was prepared by investigator, by making “Letter of <b>Law</b> <b>Assistance</b> Rejection”, stated the rejection {{to be accompanied by}} lawyer when investigated.

The writer could make problem statements : how the investigation effort to give free <b>law</b> <b>assistance</b> to the defendants who was threatened by 15 years punishment and why the defendants who was threatened by minimum 15 years punishment in investigation.

With the goal of making the environment visually uncluttered, we present a first user study to explore the visual parameters of VTE that affect the performance of the technique.
