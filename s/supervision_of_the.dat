40|$|Feelings of {{incompetence}} (FOI) are {{a pervasive}} self-care issue for practitioners of psychotherapy, independent of {{their levels of}} experience (Theriault & Gazzola, 2008). Supervision may be an effective strategy for alleviating <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> FOI; however, {{it is unclear how}} FOI are managed in supervision and how therapists experience their struggles with FOI in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>supervision.</b> <b>The</b> researcher conducted semi-structured interviews with six Master's level counselling interns (5 female, 1 male) who were receiving individual supervision. A modified grounded theory analysis (Corbin & Strauss, 2008) yielded five major categories: Properties of Intern FOI that Required Management in and/or out <b>of</b> <b>Supervision,</b> Actions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Intern that Pertain to <b>the</b> Management <b>of</b> FOI in <b>Supervision,</b> Attributes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Intern That Influence FOI-Management in <b>Supervision,</b> Aspects <b>of</b> <b>Supervision</b> That are Helpful to <b>the</b> Management <b>of</b> FOI, and Aspects <b>of</b> <b>Supervision</b> That Hinder <b>the</b> Management <b>of</b> FOI. Implications for counsellor supervisors, counsellor educators, and counselling interns themselves are discussed...|$|R
