In 1999, Morley returned to Coronation Street in the spin-off show Coronation Street: After Hours alongside former Coronation Street actress Julie Goodyear.

40|$|Background: The most {{desirable}} effect following cataract {{surgery in the}} presence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is to obtain an improvement in distance resolution acuity, and the only optical solution to this is the use of telescopic magnification. The {{purpose of the study was}} to develop and verify the clinical utility of inducing low-grade telescopic magnification (< 33 %) at the time of cataract surgery by the choice of an appropriate intraocular lens power and <b>spectacle</b> <b>glasses</b> in patients with AMD and cataract. Methods: The design was a prospective, nonrandomized, interventional case series involving 6 patients aged 74 - 86 (mean 80; SD 4) years with AMD and cataract. Participants were males and females, equal in number, who had visual acuity of less than 20 / 400 in the weaker eye. Standard cataract surgery was performed in the weaker eye. The power of the intraocular lens was derived from the reduced Gullstrand model of the eye in such a way that at the intraocular lens plane a minus lens was created, which, together with a plus lens in matching glasses, formed a Galilean telescopic system with magnification of up to 33 %. Outcome measures were visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and activities of daily living (ADL) scores. Results: The mean power of the implanted intraocular lenses was 6. 31 (SD 2. 42) diopters and, according to the theoretical derivations, achieved magnification between 20 % and 30 % (mean 26 %; SD 4. 92 %). Visual acuity improved for the group from a mean of 20 / 525 (logMAR 1. 48; SD 0. 13) to a mean of 20 / 290 (logMAR 1. 20; SD 0. 21). Contrast sensitivity improved significantly (p < 0. 001) only in the lower spatial frequencies. Postoperatively, ADL scores improved significantly in all patients except one. At the end of the follow-up period, 3 patients reported that they would like to proceed with similar surgery for the other eye. Interpretation: An optimal surgical telescopic device based on low-grade telescopic magnification may improve functional vision for usage in all tasks in AMD patients. All patients from this study were satisfied following surgery and viewed study outcomes as positive and beneficial, and some patients responded with enthusiasm. Surgeons are encouraged to use this modified technique of cataract surgery in low-vision patients with AMD and cataract. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

5000|$|Bioptics, {{also known}} as a bioptic in the singular, and {{sometimes}} more formally termed a bioptic telescope, is a term for a pair of vision-enhancement lenses. They magnify between two and four times, and are used to improve distance vision for those with severely impaired eyesight, especially those with albinism. They can either be a combination of head-mounted eyeglasses (termed the [...] "carrier") and binoculars, or be designed to attach to existing glasses. Some use monoculars which have small telescopes mounted on, in, or behind their regular lenses, so that they can look through either the regular lens or the telescope. Newer designs use smaller lightweight mini telescopes magnifying up to six times, which can be embedded into the <b>spectacle</b> <b>glass</b> and improve aesthetic appearance.

40|$|Researchers in Germany, at the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology (IGB), have {{developed}} {{new types of}} membrane adsorbers {{that are capable of}} separating unwanted particles from water whilst at the same time removing dissolved substances such as bisphenol A or toxic lead. In January 2015 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) lowered the threshold value for bisphenol A in packaging. The hormonally active bulk chemical is, amongst other things, a basic material for polycarbonate from which, for example, CDs, plastic tableware or <b>spectacles</b> <b>glasses</b> are manufactured. Because of its chemical structure, bisphenol A is not completely degraded in the biological stages of treatment plants and is discharged into rivers and lakes by purification facilities. Activated carbon or adsorber materials are already used to remove chemicals, antibiotics or heavy metals from wastewater or process water. However, a disadvantage of these highly porous materials is the long contact time that the pollutants require in order to diffuse into the pores. To ensure that as many of these harmful substances are captured as possible ‚Äì even during a short period ‚Äì treatment plants use large quantities of adsorbers in correspondingly large treatment basins. However, activated carbon can be only regenerated with a high energy input, resulting, for the most part, in the need to dispose of large quantities of material contaminated with pollutants. Although filtration, using nanofiltration or reverse osmosis membranes can remove the contaminating substances, is not yet cost-effective for the removal of dissolved molecules from high-volume flows such as process or wastewater...|$|R

While telescopes were introduced soon after their invention in amazing quantitites, it took more than a century for the first imports of microscopes to take place because they were considered to be less useful. For similar reasons the import of magnifying glasses was interrupted in 1668 when the Tokugawa regime declared a series of commodities to be unnecessary and therefore not welcome any more.

40|$|Myopia is a {{significant}} public health problem and its prevalence is increasing over time and genetic factors in disease development are important. The prevalence and incidence of myopia within sampled population often varies with age, country, sex, race, ethnicity, occupation, environment, and other factors. Myopia growth is under a combination of genes and their products {{in time and space}} to complete the coordination role of the guidance. Myopia-related genes include about 70 genetic loci to which primary myopias have been mapped, although the number is constantly increasing and depends to some extent on definition. Of these, several are associated with additional abnormalities, mostly as part of developmental syndromes. These tend to result from mutations in genes encoding transcriptional activators, and most of these have been identified by sequencing candidate genes in patients with developmental anomalies. Currently, COL 1 A 1 (collagen alpha- 1 chain of type I), COL 2 A 1 (collagen alpha- 1 chain of type II), ACTC 1 (actin, alpha, cardiac muscle 1), PAX 6 (paired box gene 6) and NIPBL (nipped-B homolog), and so on have been mapped.

We evaluated the effect of prescription eyewear in attenuating ocular exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in the sunlight portions of the ultraviolet spectrum (295 - 350 nm).
