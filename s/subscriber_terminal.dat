AUTOSEVOCOM-I was a non-tactical network, that enabled users to discuss classified or sensitive information over the telephone. The network consisted of switching centres, transmission facilities and <b>subscriber</b> <b>terminals.</b> <b>Subscribers</b> were homed either on an AUTOSEVOCOM switch, on an Automatic Voice Network (AUTOVON) switch, or a Joint Overseas Switchboard (JOSS), which were for example operated and maintained by numerous Signal Battalions in Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|Since September 2007, the Russian government's Resolution No 575 {{introduces}} new regulation {{rules of}} telematics services. Network operators (ISPs) can now legally limit individual {{actions of the}} subscriber's network activity, if such actions threaten the normal functioning of the network. ISPs are obliged to exclude the possibility of access to information systems, network addresses, or uniform pointers which a subscriber informs the operator of communication in the form specified in the contract. The subscriber is obliged to take actions to protect the <b>subscriber</b> <b>terminal</b> from the impact of malicious software and {{to prevent the spread}} of spam and malicious software to its <b>subscriber</b> <b>terminal.</b> In reality, most Russian ISPs shape the traffic of P2P protocols (like BitTorrent) with lower priority (P2P is about of 80% of traffic there). Also, there is popular method, called retracker, for redirecting some BitTorrent traffic to the ISP's cache servers and other subscribers inside of a metropolitan area network (MAN). Access to MANs is usually with greater speed (2x-1000x or more, specified in the contract) and better quality than the rest of the Internet.|$|E

50|$|Along with {{dramatic}} advances in satellite technology {{over the past}} decade, ground equipment has similarly evolved, benefiting from higher levels of integration and increasing processing power, expanding both capacity and performance boundaries.The Gateway—or Gateway Earth Station (its full name)—is {{also referred to as}} a ground station, teleport or hub. The term is sometimes used to describe just the antenna dish portion, or it can refer to the complete system with all associated components. In short, the gateway receives radio wave signals from the satellite on the last leg of the return or upstream payload, carrying the request originating from the end-user's site. The satellite modem at the gateway location demodulates the incoming signal from the outdoor antenna into IP packets and sends the packets to the local network. Access server/gateways manage traffic transported to/from the Internet. Once the initial request has been processed by the gateway's servers, sent to and returned from the Internet, the requested information is sent back as a forward or downstream payload to the end-user via the satellite, which directs the signal to the <b>subscriber</b> <b>terminal.</b> Each Gateway provides the connection to the Internet backbone for the gateway beam(s) it serves.The system of gateways comprising the satellite ground system provides all network services for satellite and corresponding terrestrial connectivity. Each gateway provides a multiservice access network for <b>subscriber</b> <b>terminal</b> connections to the Internet.In the continental United States, because it is north of the equator, all gateway and subscriber dish antenna must have an unobstructed view of the southern sky. Because of the satellite's geostationary orbit, the gateway antenna can stay pointed at a fixed position.|$|E

The analysis refers to a particular wireless communication scheme where the main transmitter (<b>subscriber</b> <b>terminal)</b> communicates with a main receiver (base station) via a cluster of cooperative network elements. The resulting cooperative network consists {{of a large number of}} array elements which are located in the proximity of the subscriber. The performance measures considered are the outage probability, the bit error rate, and the ergodic capacity, yielding closed-form expressions which offer useful off-line assessment of the deployed scheme. The resulting analysis shows that considerable performance gains can be achieved for a small amount of phase feedback information, such that the overall performance approximates the ideal case with full phase feedback information.|$|E

We assume that a time-division duplex terminal has incomplete uplink channel knowledge obtained by measuring the downlink channel during basestation transmissions. The basestation transmissions employ cyclic delay diversity, of which the terminal is unaware. The distribution of uplink power received at the basestation, with and without downlink cyclic delay diversity and with various types of power constraints at the terminal, allow us to make some surprising conclusions about how the power constraints and cyclic delay influence the performance of beamforming. We show that beamforming gains {{need to be examined}} critically beyond simple average performance metrics to conclude that they are superior to simpler channel-unaware methods. We also conclude that cyclic delay on the downlink is very beneficial to beamforming on the uplink, even with restrictive types of power constraints. I...|$|E

BFWA networks of current interest are mainly operated above 10 GHz assuming line-of-sight (LoS) connection between the base station and the <b>subscriber</b> <b>terminal.</b> In these network configurations, rain attenuation is the dominant fading mechanism and its statistical behavior severely aggravates the nominal interference environment due to the spatial inhomogeneity of rain. The BEP of a coherent QPSK demodulator in the presence of Gaussian noise, cochannel interference and rain attenuation is determined and is related to the relevant performance masks recommended by ITU-R. Numerical results of the proposed model examine how the frequency of operation, the clear-sky interference levels, the length of the interfering path and the climatic conditions affect the QoS of BFWA channels. The spectral and spatial coexistence of BFWA networks and point-to-point links is investigated...|$|E
3000|$|While {{the major}} {{cellular}} mobile operators globally {{are coming down}} on the side of rolling out LTE for future broadband communications, there is a real market opportunity for fixed broadband by WiMAX, the IEEE 802.16 wireless standard. Complementing broadband fixed line xDSL solutions, it is an immediate attractive solution in populous, and not so populous, areas without any significantly pervasive broadband access network infrastructure. Designing a scaled broadband fixed wireless access (BFWA) network based on WiMAX for populous Bangkok megacity, with its some 10 million inhabitants, is the challenge addressed by Pichet Ritthisoonthorn et al. of the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), Thailand. In their paper [...] "Planning of efficient wireless access with IEEE 802.16 for connecting home network to the internet", they set out a method for planning such a BFWA network. By defining population density-based environments, they subdivide the megacity into more manageable internally homogenous areas. They analyse relationships between coverage area and access rate for subscribers in each kind of environment area. With the inclusion of studies on throughput and channel capacity under different access rates, and also of considerations on both non-engineering and engineering factors—such as frequency bandwidth and spectrum allocation for the former, and estimation of traffic per subscriber and choice of adaptive modulation from <b>subscriber</b> <b>terminal</b> for the latter—they show that while the BFWA is a capacity limited system, a scaled WiMAX network plan is feasible and has a real potential as a broadband Internet access solution for individual homes.|$|E
30|$|The {{emergence}} of IEEE 802.16 wireless standard technology (WiMAX) has significantly increased {{the choice to}} operators for the provisioning of wireless broadband access network. WiMAX is being deployed to compliment with xDSL in underserved or lack of the broadband network area, in both developed and developing countries. Many incumbent operators in developing countries are considering the deployment of WiMAX {{as part of their}} broadband access strategy. This paper presents an efficient and simple method for planning of broadband fixed wireless access (BFWA) with IEEE 802.16 standard to support home connection to Internet. The study formulates the framework for planning both coverage and capacity designs. The relationship between coverage area and access rate from subscriber in each environment area is presented. The study also presents the throughput and channel capacity of IEEE 802.16 in different access rates. An extensive analysis is performed and the results are applied to the real case study to demonstrate the practicality of using IEEE 802.16 for connecting home to Internet. Using empirical data and original subscriber traffic from measurement, it is shown that the BFWA with IEEE 802.16 standard is a capacity limited system. The capacity of IEEE 802.16 is related to different factors including frequency bandwidth, spectrum allocation, estimation of traffic per subscriber, and choice of adaptive modulation from <b>subscriber</b> <b>terminal.</b> The wireless access methods and procedures evolved in this research work and set out in this paper are shown to be well suited for planning BFWA system based on IEEE 802.16 which supports broadband home to Internet connections.|$|E
