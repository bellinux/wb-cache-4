40|$|Coffee {{is one of}} the world’s {{most popular}} beverages, {{representing}} a major source of income for many producing countries. The typical aroma is certainly the reason of its success: it depends on the coffee variety, with its specific set of chemical precursors, {{as well as on the}} processing and consumption phases [1]. In the Harenna Forest, in the Bale National Park of Ethiopia, at an altitude of around 1800 meters, an Arabica wild coffee grows spontaneously: the Harenna Forest Wild Coffee Presidium recognizes the value of this unique and high quality product, which has been bestowed the Slow Food Presidium in 2012. It is naturally dried in loco and its exports volumes are limited, as its availability is greatly variable. The aroma of coffee is a complex bouquet of odorants of different origin: the evaluation of its composition could be used as a tool for the coffee industry to control desirable flavor outcomes of coffee through processing or other farm management technique. In this perspective, the Head-Space analysis could represent a simple, fast and accurate technique to evaluate the development of flavor-active compounds in all the phases of the coffee production. In the present study, the volatile aroma profile of Harenna wild coffee has been analysed by means of HS-SPME-GC/MS from the coffee cherry to the coffee cup, all throughout the processing phases which lead to the final product. The dried green cherries, rich in monoterpenes (especially dihydro myrcenol and limonene), esters (mainly cis- 2 -tertbutyl- cyclohexanol acetate), alkanes, and phenylpropanoids, also contain the precursors for the aroma compounds formation through the Maillard reaction, which takes place during the roasting phase. Pyrazines (mainly 2, 6 -dimethylpyrazine, 2 -ethyl- 6 -methylpyrazine, and 2, 3, 5 -trimethyl pyrazine) begin to be detected at 100 °C, to become the most abundant chemical class on the later roasting phases, when the temperature reaches 160, 180, and 204 °C, the final roasting temperature. Pyridines (mostly pyridine) are also developed during the roasting phase: they are only detected in the samples roasted over the temperature of 160 °C. Furans (mostly 2 -furan methanol, 5 -methyl furfural and furfuryl acetate) are also developed through thermal treatment, while monoterpenes decrement as they are volatilized very soon in the roasting process. This is also confirmed by their detection in the coffee <b>silverskins,</b> for which the volatiles emission profile is similar to the green cherries one: they retain the early-released volatiles as they are soon separated from the cherries in the roaster...|$|R

40|$|Corn cobs, coffee <b>silverskin,</b> and {{cork oak}} {{were used as}} support and {{nutrient}} source during the fructooligosaccharides (FOS) production by Aspergillus japonicus, under solid-state fermentation (SSF) conditions. The objectives of this study consisted in evaluating the possibility of improving the FOS yield and productivity, besides to finding an alternative to reduce the production costs, and add value to these agro-industrial residues. Fermentation assays were performed by using the materials as solid support, supplemented or not with nutrients. For comparison, assays were also performed using a synthetic material as solid support, under the same operational conditions. All the material residues acted as nutrient source for the microorganism, since FOS production occurred when {{all of them were}} used without nutrient supplementation, but not when the synthetic material was used. Among the evaluated materials, coffee <b>silverskin</b> gave the most interesting fermentation results, with a FOS production similar in both supplemented and non-supplemented media.

The sustainability of coffee production can be achieved introducing new applications for the valorization of coffee by-products. Coffee <b>silverskin</b> is the by-product generated during roasting, and because of its powerful antioxidant capacity, coffee <b>silverskin</b> aqueous extract (CSE) may be used for other applications, such as antiaging cosmetics and dermaceutics. This study aims to contribute to the coffee sector’s sustainability through the application of CSE to preserve skin health. Preclinical data regarding the antiaging properties of CSE employing human keratinocytes and Caenorhabditis elegans are collected during the present study. Accelerated aging was induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) in HaCaT cells and by ultraviolet radiation C (UVC) in C. elegans. Results suggest that the tested concentrations of coffee extracts were not cytotoxic, and CSE 1 mg/mL gave resistance to skin cells when oxidative damage was induced by t-BOOH. On the other hand, nematodes treated with CSE (1 mg/mL) showed a significant increased longevity compared to those cultured on a standard diet.

Aim of this study was the evaluation of the effects on the quality properties of bakery products added with coffee <b>silverskin</b> (CS). A model sponge cake formulation was used and products with 5 % of CS (% on the flour weight) or without CS (reference) were prepared. In order to increase the nutritional value, CS was subjected to a alkaline hydrogen peroxide treatment. Chemical, physical and physico-chemical analyses (before and after the pre-treatment of the film) of CS were performed. Texture, image analysis and sensory tests of the CS-added and reference sponge cake were carried out. Results of the analyses evidenced that the addition of CS was an interesting ingredient. No main differences were determined on the chemical properties. Dynamometric measurements showed slight differences due to CS addition on texture while colour was mainly affected as the coffee silver skin led to a yellow-brown colour of the cake.

In this sense {{the possibility of using}} the roasted coffee <b>silverskin</b> (CS), a byproduct of roasted coffee beans, as an antiglycative ingredient has been evaluated, but maintaining an environment friendly method of extraction. CS is the outer layer of the roasted coffee beans. Water soluble fraction from an Arabica roasted CS was obtained, freeze-dried, and characterized by its antioxidant activity. Antiglicative activity of CS extract was evaluated in BSA-glucose (21 days; Ext/Emm. 360 / 420) and BSA-methylglyoxal (14 days; Ext/Emm. 340 / 420) assays in the range of 0. 5 to 25 mg/mL. Reaction mixtures were prepared containing 10 mg BSA in 100 mM saline phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4) containing sodium azide, EDTA, and penicillin-G and incubated at 37 °C. Then, triplicate 100 ¿L aliquots were removed and their fluorescence intensity and scan of fluorescence (emission) was measured in a spectrofluorometer platereader (Synergy-MX, BioTek Instruments, USA). In both assays, aminoguanidine (0. 4 mg/mL, > 90 % inhibition) was used as reference. To determine whether the extracts themselves interfered with fluorescence (quenching), each extract was tested in the absence of BSA for 14 and 21 days. Glycated BSA is an indicator of the extent of the reaction and was reduced significantly in presence of the aqueous extract from CS. IC 50 was 8. 2 ± 0. 26 mg/mL and 3. 9 ± 0. 1 mg/mL for BSA-MGO and BSA-Glc assays, respectively. In the reaction media, IC 50 values represent an effective concentration of 1. 17 mg of CS extract per 10 mg BSA and 0. 23 mg MGO for the BSA-MGO assay; and 0. 56 mg CS extract per 10 mg BSA and 100 mg glucose for the BSA-Glc assay. Intrinsic fluorescence was subtracted from calculation and represent 2. 4 % and 8. 2 % for BSA-MGO and BSA-Glc, respectively at 1 mg/mL. CS could offer a potential therapeutic approach for the prevention of diabetic or other pathogenic complications induced by AGEs.

SSF reaches also the highest annual profit (6. 55 M) and presents the lowest payback time (2. 27 years).

40|$|The {{conditions}} of temperature, moisture content, and inoculum rate able {{to maximize the}} production of fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and β-fructofuranosidase (FFase) enzyme by solid-state fermentation were established. Fermentation assays were performed using the support material (coffee <b>silverskin)</b> moistened to 60, 70, or 80 % with a 240 -g/l sucrose solution and inoculated with a spore suspension of Aspergillus japonicus to obtain 2 × 10 5, 2 × 10 6, or 2 × 10 7 spores/gram dry material. The fermentation runs were maintained under static conditions at 26, 30, or 34 °C during 20 h. The moisture content did not influence the FOS and FFase production; however, temperature between 26 and 30 °C and inoculum rate of approximately 2 × 10 7 spores/gram dry material maximized the results (FOS = 208. 8 g/l with productivity of 10. 44 g/l h; FFase = 64. 12 units U/ml with productivity of 4. 0 U/ml h). These results are considerably higher than those obtained under no optimized fermentation conditions and represent an important contribution {{for the establishment of}} a new industrial process for FOS and FFase production.

40|$|Significant {{amounts of}} wastes are {{generated}} by the coffee industry, among of which, coffee <b>silverskin</b> (CS) and spent coffee grounds (SCG) are the most abundantly generated during the beans roasting and instant coffee preparation, respectively. This study evaluated the sugars metabolism and production of ethanol by three different yeast strains (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia stipitis and Kluyveromyces fragilis) when cultivated in sugar rich hydrolysates produced by acid hydrolysis of CS and SCG. S. cerevisiae provided the best ethanol production from SCG hydrolysate (11. 7 g/l, 50. 2 % efficiency). On the other hand, insignificant (<= 1. 0 g/l) ethanol production was obtained from CS hydrolysate, for all the evaluated yeast strains, {{probably due to the}} low sugars concentration present in this medium (approx. 22 g/l). It was concluded {{that it is possible to}} reuse SCG as raw material for ethanol production, which is of great interest for the production of this biofuel, as well as to add value to this agro-industrial waste. CS hydrolysate, in the way that is produced, was not a suitable fermentation medium for ethanol production; however, the hydrolysate concentration for the sugars content increase previous the use as fermentation medium could be an alternative to overcome this problem.
