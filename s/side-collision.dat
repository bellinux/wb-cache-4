40|$|Because the {{snowplow}} operator's {{tasks are}} predominately visual, warnings presented visually {{may interfere with}} critical tasks. Auditory warnings could reduce visual load if they are meaningful, effectively signal danger, and are not annoying. We conducted a driving simulation experiment-using a 210 -degree forward field-of-view driving simulator-and a field test to investigate using auditory icons as side- and forward-collision avoidance warnings. Participants in the experiment drove on simulated snow-covered roads in 105 -meter (344 -feet) visibility conditions. Analysis of data from 28 participants showed the <b>side-collision</b> avoidance warnings were equally effective; lane change response times were approximately 1. 1 seconds for both a single- 187 / double-beep car horn warning-although participants said the double-beep warning sounded more urgent. Analysis of the forward-collision avoidance warning data, obtained from 32 participants, showed the mean response time with a warning consisting of two bursts of screeching-tire sounds was significantly faster than with a singlescreech warning-with both warnings significantly faster than the mean time obtained when no warning was given. The poorest collision outcomes occurred with no warning-outcomes were better with the single-screech warning, and better still with the double-screech warning (which the participants said sounded more urgent than the single-beep warning). In the field test, six of seven snowplow operators preferred the double-beep <b>side-collision</b> warning. We recommend an auditory icon sounding like the double-beep of a car horn {{be used as a}} <b>side-collision</b> avoidance warning and an auditory icon sounding like two successive bursts of screeching tires should be used as a forward-collision avoidance warning. A driving simulation experiment was conducted to investigate auditory icons as side- and forward-collision avoidance warnings. The auditory warnings produced significantly faster mean response times than with no warning, and participants preferred a double-beep side collision warning over a single-beep warning. Researchers recommend a double-beep auditory warning similar to the double-beep of a car horn for <b>side-collision</b> avoidance and a forward-collision avoidance warning similar to two successive bursts of screeching tires.

40|$|The {{first phase}} {{in a study}} of traffic {{accidents}} in the province of Noord-Brabant, in which Noord-Brabant was compared with the other provinces, has been completed. In Noord-Brabant there are more fatalities in traffic accidents outside built-up areas; also many fatalities occur in dusk and darkness and rear collisions and <b>side-collisions</b> occur. In the morning peak-hour there are many fatalities among cyclists and moped riders. In {{the second phase of the}} study some of these differences will be studied. From the point of view of the size of the province, the number of inhabitants and the length of the road network Noord-Brabant is one of the least safe provinces...|$|R
40|$|The {{first phase}} {{in a study}} of traffic {{accidents}} in the province of Noord-Brabant, in which Noord-Brabant was compared with the other provinces in the Netherlands, has been completed. On the basis of {{the results of this study}} recommendations are made for phase 2, in which a selection will be made for further research. Research will be done in particular on: (1) front-rear collisions and <b>side-collisions,</b> (2) traffic accidents in dusk and darkness, (3) traffic accidents at junctions, (4) traffic accidents on the different days of the week and (5) traffic accidents in which one vehicle is involved. This research results in measures and recommendations for allocation of priorities to prevent accidents. For parts I and II see IRRD abstract no 224121...|$|R
