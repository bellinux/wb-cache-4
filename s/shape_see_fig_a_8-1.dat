40|$|Abstract. Paramecium trichocysts are unusual {{secretory}} organdies in that: (a) their crystalline contents {{are built}} {{up from a}} family of low molecular mass acidic proteins; (b) they have a precise, genetically determined shape; and (c) the crystalline trichocyst contents expand rapidly upon exocytosis to give a second, extracellular form which is also an ordered array. We report here the first step of our study of trichocyst structure. We have used a combination of x-ray powder diffraction, freeze-etching, and freeze-fracture electron microscopy of isolated, untreated trichocysts, and density measurements to show that trichocyst contents are indeed protein crystals and to determine the elementary unit cell of both the compact intracellular and the extended extracellular form. C ELLS package the proteins they export in a variety of physical states. Although the basic mechanisms involved in the synthesis, concentration, storage, and secretion of these proteins are essentially the same in all instances (Palade, 1975), the contents of a secretory granule may be a solution of macromolecules, a charge-neutralized precipitate that is either soluble or insoluble once it has left the cell, or a crystal (Poisner and Trifar 6, 1982). The trichocysts of Paramecium, like other protozoan "extrusosomes" (Hausmann, 1978), are secretory organelles in which proteins are packaged with crystalline organization. Unlike any known metazoan secretory granule, the trichocyst contents not only remains insoluble upon secretion, but undergoes a rapid change of state (mediated by Ca ++ and involving uptake of 1 - 120 by the structure) to give an extended extracellular form which is also an ordered army. The crystalline contents of the secretory vesicle have <b>a</b> precise <b>shape</b> (<b>see</b> <b>Fig.</b> 1 <b>A).</b> On average ~ 3 ~tm long and 1 ~trn across at the widest point, the body of a trichocyst (intracellular form) is shaped like a carrot with an elaborate tip at the wide end, by which it is attached to preformed cortical sites to await exocytosis. This shape may be altered by single gen...|$|R

Figure 3 displays the Lagrange-type and augmented Lagrange-type shape functions for a two-node beam element.

40|$|As {{described}} {{in the text of}} the main paper, this baseline is a sanity check to assure the difficulty of generating prototypical shapes. We manually partition the images into the “ideal ” clusters, so that each cluster has 100 % purity, and then simply average the aligned edge images, using the confidence weights given by the Pb detector [1]. The sanity check baseline helps to indicate the contribution made by our fragment weighting and prototype formation. Fig. 1 (a-c) show the prototypical shapes formed by the baseline on the Caltech images, ETHZ bounding box regions, and ETHZ expanded regions, respectively. For the Caltech images, the baseline clearly cannot discover the shape agreement, even though the input clusters were perfect. The baseline does pretty well to discover shape on the ETHZ bounding box regions, which is expected, since those regions are scalenormalized and aligned. The baseline performs worse on the ETHZ expanded regions due to clutter in the images; it discovers shapes with some accuracy for only a couple of categories (Applelogos and Bottles).
