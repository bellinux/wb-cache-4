In this article, I discuss the production of truth in the case of Marie Blomme, who claimed to have born a child of the treasurer of the Flemish town of Kortrijk, Joseph Coppieters, in the 1720 <b>s.</b> <b>I</b> analyse four <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> truth production: court, reputation, confession and self-reflection. Of each <b>of</b> these <b>forms,</b> importance, precise object, method of producing truth, and status as truth are investigated. Finally, I propose that the conflicting truths in which these <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> truth production resulted, suggest a lack of concern for authenticity in the early eighteenth century. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Let S be {{a set of}} n {{points in}} RdUnknown control {{sequence}} ", and let r be a parameter with 1 ¿=¿r¿=¿n. A rectilinear r-partition for S is a collection ¿(S) :¿=¿(S 1,b 1),…,(S t,b t), such that the sets <b>S</b> <b>i</b> <b>form</b> a partition <b>of</b> <b>S,</b> each b <b>i</b> is the bounding box of <b>S</b> <b>i,</b> and n/ 2 r¿=¿|S i |¿=¿ 2 n/r for all 1 ¿=¿i¿=¿t. The (rectilinear) stabbing number of ¿(S) is {{the maximum number of}} bounding boxes in ¿(S) that are intersected by an axis-parallel hyperplane h. We study the problem of finding an optimal rectilinear r-partition—a rectilinear partition with minimum stabbing number—for a given set S. We obtain the following results. • Computing an optimal partition is np-hard already in R 2 Unknown control sequence ". • There are point sets such that any partition with disjoint bounding boxes has stabbing number O(r 1 ¿-¿ 1 /d), while the optimal partition has stabbing number 2. • An exact algorithm to compute optimal partitions, running in polynomial time if r is a constant, and a faster 2 -approximation algorithm. • An experimental investigation of various heuristics for computing rectilinear r-partitions in R 2 Unknown control sequence "...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} its author {{presents}} the first theoretical study of audio description (AD) in the Czech Republic. The {{aim of this}} paper is to summarize current international knowledge of AD, explore the status quo in the Czech Republic, assess applicability of the international experience in the Czech environment and, finally, propase further steps to be taken in order to enhance AD practice and theoretical research in the Czech Republic. Audio description <b>i</b> <b>s</b> a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> translation where, to quote J oel Snyder' s pa per, visual is made verbal. As such, it plays an important role in today's society: to people with visual impairment AD conveys information that would otherwise be inaccessible. Audio description facilitates access to culture and, in a broader sense, helps integrate the visually impaired into the society. In addition, AD in some countries serves as a learning tool for non-native speakers and for students with learning difficulties. Given its integrative potential, it is highly desirable to promote audio description and ensure its professional quality. As of today, several major countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Germany have taken a clear structured approach to audio description. The model for development of AD is the United Kingdom, where a tenth of digital [...] ...|$|R
