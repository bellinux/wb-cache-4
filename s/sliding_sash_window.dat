50|$|A single-hung {{sash window}} {{is a window}} that has one sash that is movable (usually the bottom one) and the other fixed. This is the earlier form of <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>window,</b> and is also cheaper.|$|E
50|$|A {{horizontal}} <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> has {{two or more}} sashes that overlap slightly but slide horizontally {{within the}} frame. In the UK, these are sometimes called Yorkshire sash windows, presumably because of their traditional use in that county.|$|E
5000|$|The first storey facade, set between 2 pilasters with {{decorative}} caps, {{is based}} on the Dutch gable style. There is a centrally placed oriel window with a pressed metal base and corrugated iron hipped roof. The side lights are single 4:1 pane timber vertical sliding sashes and the front light is a pair of 6:1 pane timber vertical sliding sashes. There is a single 4:1 pane vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> placed symmetrically either side of the oriel. These windows have a hood supported on decorative brackets. Above the oriel there are the initials [...] "H.A.C.B.S." [...] in raised lettering inside a curved boarder. There is a single shamrock {{on the face of the}} pilasters.|$|E
5000|$|... {{reinstatement}} {{of painted}} timber windows {{to the original}} design. These will in most, but not all cases be vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The {{house has}} timber <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> and timber doors. The street entry door has stained glass set in timber surrounds. The house {{contains}} some fine pressed metal wall and ceiling sheeting.|$|R
50|$|The hotel {{contains}} two {{bars on the}} ground floor, and accommodation upstairs. The principal bar, which is entered from the street corner, displays evidence of having once been two rooms, with an original timber archway and new post and beam replacing the wall. The bar has French doors and <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows,</b> and arched <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> {{either side of the}} corner entrance. The entry vestibule to the upstairs accommodation to the south of the bar has a decorative arch above the foot of the timber stairs. The stairs have a carved balustrade, and a stained glass window at the half-landing.|$|R
50|$|A chainlink fence {{sets off}} the {{building}} itself and its short concrete walk from the sidewalk. It is a log cabin, 16 by 18 ft, one storey high on a concrete foundation topped by a shingled hipped roof. Two small planters and a low wooden stoop are in front.The main entrance is in {{the centre of the}} east (front) facade; it is set with a door of untreated vertical board and padlocked. The bay to its west has a wooden interpretive plaque where a window was once located. On the south facade there is a horizontal double-hung <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> with six square panes on the west and four on the east set in a plain wooden surround. On the opposite side is a single six-pane casement window with the same wooden surround and wooden paneling covering the logs below. The west (rear) facade also has a single window. A narrow plain frieze {{at the end of the}} eave sets off the roofline.|$|E
50|$|The front (west) {{elevation}} comprises a two-storeyed decorative gable {{structure with}} asymmetric single-storeyed wing walls to the side. The ground floor and wing walls are of rendered masonry construction, {{while the first}} storey decorative gable is formed in pressed metal sheeting over timber. The ground floor has a centrally placed open entrance, over which is a cantilevered awning with pressed metal detailing. There are two symmetrically placed windows with decorative architraves. The window {{on the south side}} is a 6:9 pane timber vertical sliding sash, the window on the north side is a 6:1 pane timber vertical sliding sash. The side wing walls are terminated by a pilaster with a decorative cap. The north wall which has a pair of vertical timber doors, acts purely as a screen wall with no building behind. The south wall has a 6:4 pane timber vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> and a timber door giving access to a store room.|$|E
50|$|Internally, {{the ground}} floor has a {{full-length}} hall {{on the west side}} with a steep timber staircase running up the side wall. The single- flight staircase has four stairs turning onto the first floor landing, and has a turned newel post and simple stick balusters. The hall has a timber arch with decorative brackets separating vestibule from stairwell. The vestibule has a s decorative plaster ceiling; the remainder of the hall (ceiling and walls) is covered in fibrous-cement or ply-wood sheeting with timber battens. Two rooms, one front and one back, open off the hall on {{the ground floor}}. The front room has two timber 6 over 6 timber vertical sliding sash windows to the front (south) elevation and 1 to the side elevation. The ceiling is lined in jointed timber boarding with a decorative timber (gas) vent. The walls are lined with ply-wood timber sheeting with battens. The north dividing wall has double and single leaf 4 panel timber doors leading to the room at the rear. The rear room has a single 6:6 timber vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> to the side elevation, and a blocked window to the rear (north) elevation. There is a fireplace with early timber fire surround. The ceiling is lined with timber boarding with central timber decorative (gas) vent. The walls are lined with plywood sheeting with timber battens.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is significant as a substantially intact, small rural school {{building of the}} early 20th century. Evidence of its early open-air form remains in the extant <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> which replaced the original canvas blinds in 1924.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{is supported by}} a steel frame, with socle (plinth) of dressed granite, marble columns and plastered brickwork. The roof is pitched, which distinguishes it from the multitude of later, taller buildings which had flat concrete roof construction. Timber-framed <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> provide elegant fenestration.|$|R
50|$|The {{classrooms}} {{are lined}} and rendered internally, and have sheeted ceilings. All the classrooms are accessed {{from both sides}} via timber double doors. The rooms have two types of grided timber windows; paired <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows,</b> and high-set grided timber windows with an inward tilting panel.|$|R
40|$|Residence in Parktown, 1902. A {{good example}} of the late Victorian house, built on a large scale in south Africa, from 1890 to 1905. Foundations and plinths are of stone, while red brick was contrasted with white wooden werandah pillars and parapet {{railings}} in stock geometric patterns. Other features include <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows,</b> these being crowned with finials...|$|R
50|$|The {{upper level}} has glazed timber French doors leading onto the verandah, {{the lower level}} has timber <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> and timber doors. The {{sandstone}} is square-snecked coursed, and has been recently repointed. The north-west {{corner of the house}} has a corrugated iron wash house incorporated into the base of a water tank on tall timber stumps.|$|R
50|$|Types {{include the}} eyebrow window, fixed windows, single-hung and double-hung <b>sash</b> <b>windows,</b> {{horizontal}} <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows,</b> casement windows, awning windows, hopper windows, tilt and slide windows (often door-sized), {{tilt and turn}} windows, transom windows, sidelight windows, jalousie or louvered windows, clerestory windows, skylights, roof windows, roof lanterns, bay windows, oriel windows, thermal, or Diocletian, windows, picture windows, emergency exit windows, stained glass windows, French windows, panel windows, and double - and triple paned windows.|$|R
50|$|The house {{comprises}} {{a picturesque}} composition of steep, decorated gables, encircled by verandahs. To the north, {{the line of}} the verandah roof is broken by an entry portico with a hipped roof. The residence is lined with deep chamferboard, has <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows,</b> and sits on a brick base. The verandah has a gently curved corrugated roof, and cast iron valances and balustrades.|$|R
50|$|Further {{dendrochronology}} {{performed in}} the roof structure indicated that significant changes {{were made to the}} building between 1767 and 1768. These changes include; extending the dwelling on the east by 6 ft and on the west by 12 ft, extending the loft to a full story across the south facade only, the addition of two outward flanking chimney stacks, encasing the south facing facade with brick nogging and a veneer brick, adding 16/16 common <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> of the first floor and 9/9 common <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> on the second floor. The veneer brick and addition of solid masonry were set in an artful Flemish bond pattern with glazed headers, queen course and oyster shell lime mortar with a grapevine joint. During this expansion it is assumed that the northward ell was not modified, however this portion of the building was removed in a subsequent renovation likely to have occurred circa 1897.|$|R
50|$|Along {{both sides}} of the hall are further windows with timber hoods. The {{projecting}} wings generally have aluminium-framed, <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows.</b> On either side of the building is a timber-framed deck providing access to the hall interior via original timber braced and board double doors with glazed fanlights. Across the rear elevation is a timber-framed verandah providing access {{to the back of the}} stage. The rear elevation has a door to the understorey.|$|R
50|$|Few {{significant}} external alterations {{were subsequently}} {{made to the}} building. The tile hanging {{on the east side}} of the house and the horizontal <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> of the kitchen (east wing) are of 19th century origin, as are the French doors in the ground floor north room at the west side of the house. The glazing of the French doors is consistent with an Arts and Crafts era and this may be attributable to Arthur Weekes and his wife Jessie Nelson Weekes, resident together from the date of their marriage in 1888 until Arthur’s death in 1917.|$|R
50|$|The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage {{describes}} it as a detached three-bay, two-storey house, built c. 1840, having a front porch, two-storey extension on the southern side, and u-plan hipped slate roof with rendered chimney stacks. Two-storey outbuildings are arranged around a rear courtyard, {{one of which is}} a former barn with stone steps leading to its western elevation. To the south-east is the remains of a red-brick walled garden. Square-profile entrance gate piers adjoin the roadway. Set within its own grounds, the timber <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> and extensive range of outbuildings add context to its setting.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has an L-shaped plan form, {{with the former}} Post Office at the western end, and the remainder formerly the residence. The gabled roof, clad in corrugated iron, follows {{the form of the}} building and accentuates the projecting bay of the office. The building features three open verandahs, to the front and rear of the residence, and the side of the office. The external walls are clad in weatherboards, punctuated by vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows,</b> with timber-framed window hoods to those of the north-eastern elevation. The building is low set, now supported on steel posts, with timber steps to each verandah and the entry porch.|$|R
50|$|Among other characteristics, First Period {{houses have}} a steeply pitched roof; a {{slightly}} asymmetrical plan; and a central chimney. The first period house is distinguished from later houses by its exposed (often decorated or chamfered) frame in the interior. Some early windows in modest houses {{may have had}} no glazing, but the standard first period window, until at least 1700, was the diamond-paned casement. No example {{of this type of}} window survives in situ; all current examples date to (at the very earliest) the late 19th century. Multiple-light, <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> started to appear around 1700, and by about 1750 had supplanted the earlier type.|$|R
5000|$|As of 2016, the Diamond Bar remains open. Some older {{exterior}} {{features are}} still visible, including the front bay-window and an iron ring {{attached to the}} front wall where horses would have been tied, which still {{as they were in}} 1922. The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage listing describes the building as a [...] "detached three-bay two-storey house, built in 1840, with shopfront to front (north-west) elevation and single-storey extension to side (south-west) [...].and.. timber <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows,</b> attractive tripartite pubfront window opening and render detailing." [...] The Diamond Bar organises traditional Irish road bowling events and offers tours of the Collins' ambush site.|$|R
50|$|Each street {{facade of}} the two-storeyed corner block is divided into six bays by {{rendered}} pilasters. Between is tuck-pointed brickwork and pairs of vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> with projecting sills and bracketed heads. Above is a projecting cornice, and a parapet with open circular motifs and finials with four-sided triangular pediments, however the finials of the south wing have been removed. The parapet has higher bays in brickwork emphasising the ends and {{the corner of the}} two-storey block. The present awning is cantilevered, replacing an earlier posted version, and supports some timber farm relics. Above the awning is a row of small clerestory-like windows with arched brick lintels, which light the ground floor.|$|R
5000|$|The street {{elevation}} {{at ground}} level has three separate entries and windows. To the western end is a four-panelled door with tilting fanlight beside a small vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>sashed</b> <b>window.</b> To the centre is a similar door, with [...] "Plumb's Chambers" [...] painted to the fanlight, {{and a group of}} three windows beside. To the eastern end is a timber shopfront which angles back to the recessed entry of panelled French doors. The underside of the verandah is of ripple iron with internal gutters and a moulded plaster cornice at the wall. The verandah is accessed at the upper level by four pairs of glazed French doors. Only the stonework to this street elevation has been painted.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} of the central area is also an open space with 190mm stop-chamfered timber posts {{supporting}} steel roof beams lined with timber boards. Over the new stair, there is evidence in the tongue and groove ceiling of the former location of the building's lift. To the south-east corner are partitions enclosing the toilets and a caged service hoist. Vertical <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> continue on those sides not fronting the streets but with less frequency, and from here can be seen the corrugated iron roofs of the single-storey wings. These are a series of parallel hipped structures with gutters between, and rooflights interrupting the ridges. These rooflights are small rectangular pavilions with windows on all four sides, and hipped roofs featuring acroteria to the gutter corners.|$|R
50|$|The {{verandah}} sits at half level above Gloucester St, and is accessed via stone stairs. It has timber rectangular columns with timber capitals, and an unpainted timber boarded ceiling. The dormer above has a hipped roof, and the half-round guttering {{is decorated}} with cresting at the corners. A sandstone and brick chimney rises above the roofline. The windows are multi-paned timber <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows,</b> and have textured sandstone lintels, quoins and sills; the doors also have textured sandstone surrounds. The eastern attic window is flanked by two timber rails {{which may have been}} a lifting device. The rear wing has a hipped corrugated iron roof which adjoins that of its neighbour. A small brick and corrugated iron outhouse sits {{to the west of the}} kitchen.|$|R
500|$|Built in 1818, the Gurdon Bill Store is a [...] by [...] -story clapboarded store. The {{walls extend}} higher up than the ceiling to an attic for {{additional}} storage space. The wood-shingled gable roof {{also has a}} smaller pent roof on the front facade that projects about [...] beyond the wall, which is unusual in New England architecture. The foundation of the store is built upon fieldstone and has stone blocks above the ground; the store has a full cellar. The main facade has two large twelve-by-twelve light <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> {{on the left side}} that can be covered with three-part batten shutters. The main door is a Dutch door with a plain frame and to its right is a smaller six-by-six <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> without a batten shutter. The rear facade is plain and devoid of any windows. The north end of has four windows, two for the attic, and the south end has only two windows for the attic, all with six-over-six sash.|$|R

50|$|Grange Lane, {{which is}} home to the area's oldest {{building}} - Grange Lodge, is noted for a series of cottage and farm buildings. The oldest of these, the Grade II listed Paradise Cottages, were built {{at the beginning of the}} eighteenth century from rough sandstone, with ashlar lintels above the windows and boarded and studded doors. Also Grade II listed are the York cottages, which were built in the early nineteenth century. Set back from the road itself, the buildings are noted for their arched doors, blind fanlights and <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows.</b> A later addition were the Soarer Cottages, which were constructed by William Hall Walker - later to come Baron Wavertree - in 1896. These 'model' cottages were built adjacent to a series of polo stables, which are today known as Grange Mews, that had been constructed for Walker in 1895. The Soarer cottages were designed in Tudor Style with an open front courtyard and built from brick, with panelled stone-mullioned windows.|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} of the cabin is partitioned into three rooms. The interior petitions are made of peeled stacked logs with mortar chinking between logs. The front room (office) is at north end of building. The bedroom takes up the southwest quarter and the kitchen is in the southeast quarter. A steel cable connects the two long walls to keep the winter snow load from forcing {{the sides of the}} cabin apart. The floor is covered with 4 in tongue-and-groove fir planks. The cabin has three doors: a front door facing west, a back door facing east, and a kitchen door facing south. The office has two casement windows. The bedroom and kitchen each have two horizontal <b>sliding</b> <b>sash</b> <b>windows.</b> The kitchen has built-in knotty pine cupboards and the bedroom has a built-in knotty pine dresser. The bedroom also has a built-in closet with knotty pine doors. The ceiling is covered with 4 in-wide tongue-and-groove fir boards.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} {{has evolved from}} an open sided kiosk, and the main section is formed by two adjoining similar kiosk structures, with a two-storeyed service wing to the rear and an addition to the northeast. The kiosk section has <b>sliding</b> multi-paned <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> which can be concealed within the solid balustrade below, and multi-paned fanlight glazing above. The balustrade has fibrous cement panels with timber mouldings. The service wing and northeast addition have weatherboard cladding, with a brick base to the northeast.|$|R
50|$|Jalousie windows {{maximise}} {{natural ventilation}} by allowing airflow {{through the entire}} window area. Historically made only of wooden slats or glass panes, they are well suited to mild-winter climates. With mass production they became very common throughout homes in mid-20th-century Florida, Hawaii, southern California, the deep South, and Latin America. In cooler regions they were rapidly adopted to porches and sunrooms. They were also widely used in mobile homes during the 1950s and 1960s before most manufacturers began switching to <b>sliding</b> and <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> in subsequent decades.|$|R
50|$|The Homestead (1897) (Bldg 8124) is a low-set timber building, also Federation style, {{constructed}} as a residence for {{the principal of}} the college.
