In {{order to}} know the sealing ability under axial {{alternating}} tension load, a 88. 9 mm√ó 6. 45 mm P 110 premium tubing connection is established with multiple linear elastic plastic finite element model, stress and contact pressure on sealing surface and torque shoulder are analyzed under axial alternating tension load and 80 MPa inner pressure. The results show that tubing connection slide by the axial tension, while the maximum contact pressure on <b>seal</b> <b>surface</b> reduced. With the increasing of alternating cycle, the maximum equivalent stress on <b>seal</b> <b>surface</b> increased and the maximum contact pressure on <b>seal</b> <b>surface</b> decreased.

40|$|This paper aims at a {{theoretical}} {{explanation of the}} following two experimental observations of radial lip seals: fluid film formation and upstream pumping action. The origins of these observations are still poorly understood. A hydrodynamic analysis is presented for the fully flooded contact zone of a smooth shaft surface running against a rough <b>seal</b> <b>surface.</b> Four roughness structures are considered: one-dimensional sinusoidal and two-dimensional sinusoidal seal roughness structures both without and with a tangential <b>seal</b> <b>surface</b> displacement. The tangential <b>seal</b> <b>surface</b> displacement is chosen asymmetric with the axial position in the contact. It follows that the tangential deformation of the one- and two-dimensional seal roughness structures used in this paper can explain the aforementioned experimental observations and simulate the observed order of magnitude of load-carrying capacity, pump rate, and friction torque found in the literature...|$|E

The study results show that local contact situation of the spherical mechanical seal is in the outside of the seal rings, and both maximum contact pressure and temperature appearat the same position. As sea water pressure and stern shaft rotary speed are increased, the contact pressure and temperature of the spherical <b>seal</b> <b>surface</b> are raised, and when the contact pressure of <b>seal</b> <b>surface</b> is 0, the spherical <b>seal</b> <b>surface</b> forms two zones including contact one and clearance zone.

40|$|Friction-induced {{vibrations}} may {{in certain}} conditions cause squeal noise to occur. Squeal may be generated in partly wet glass-run window systems {{due to the}} friction between the <b>seal</b> <b>surface</b> and the window. Squeal noise causes annoyance and conveys a subjective impression of poor vehicle quality. ^ The transient vibrations and sound featured an increase in amplitude with high fundamental frequency in the experiment of a seal sample and a moving glass panel. Multiple harmonics of the fundamental frequency and frequency jumps were observed in vibration frequency spectra. The frequency decreased as the amplitude of the vibration increased, which is characteristic of stick-slip oscillations. The vibrations occurred {{when there was a}} large decrease of the friction force during a surge in speed. ^ An approximate expression for the frequency of the stick-slip oscillations was obtained in a single-degree of freedom model. The model indicated that the frequency decreased as the normal force and the difference between the static and kinetic friction coefficients were increased. ^ The seal was idealized as a continuous one-dimensional rod, and the glass was represented as a sliding, concentrated contact force. The system became unstable when the magnitude of the normal force and the magnitude of the negative slope in the friction law were large. Harmonics of the fundamental frequency were observed in spectrograms of the responses. The frequency was shifted between modal frequencies because of modal amplitude variations with the position of the contact force. ^ Stick-slip oscillations were simulated in a finite element model using an explicit time marching method. Slipping occurred locally in regions of the <b>seal</b> <b>surface</b> where the elastic force overcame the static friction force. The stick-slip phenomenon was found to propagate between the speeds of dilatational and transverse waves. The motion of the seal at the slipping phase was in the direction of friction force. The peak frequency was found to vary according to the glass position on the <b>seal</b> <b>surface.</b> It was suggested that both periods of stick motion and slip motion should be considered in order to estimate the frequency of the stick-slip oscillations. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{primary purpose}} of valve seals in {{inhalation}} and other drug dispensing devices is to inhibit leakage of highly volatile formulation from pressurised canisters. This requirement often conflicts with smooth operation of valves because of poor lubrication of seals. The repercussions {{of this can be}} variability in dispensed dose as well as loss of prime and gradual wear of seals. Although a good volume of literature is available for general purpose o-ring seals, the characteristic behaviour of those used in pharmaceutical devices deviate from this significantly. The paper studies tribology of such seals, subjected to global fitment and canister pressure deformation and localised conjunctional elastohydrodynamic pressures. It is shown that ideally smooth seals would operate under iso-viscous elastic (soft EHL) regime of lubrication. However, the predicted ultra-thin films are insufficient to ensure fluid film lubrication because of rough micro-scale nature of elastomeric <b>seal</b> <b>surface</b> and poor lubricity of the usual bio-compatible formulations. The paper also shows that siliconisation of elastomeric contacting surface only marginally improves its tribological performance...|$|E
40|$|In general a road {{cannot be}} {{maintained}} indefinitely through routine, minimum maintenance because only {{the surface is}} being maintained while the underlying layers continue to deteriorate. This phenomenon is not usually reflected in the performance models used in pavement management and design systems. Similarly, it is often common practice to <b>seal</b> <b>surface</b> cracks {{in order to keep}} water out of the base and prevent softening. Once again, the effect (in this case reduction in deterioration) on the base is seldom modeled. These are examples of strong interactions between the rate of deterioration of one layer and the level of deterioration in another. This paper discusses interactivity among individual components or deterioration modes of a pavement structure and presents a method for the modeling of this. In addition, we demonstrate the use of the model for determining an optimum maintenance strategy over an analysis period, and discuss the practical implementation of the method. Performance prediction is one of the fundamental requirements for generating an optimum construction and rehabilitation strategy for a pavement (Haas, 1994). This prediction is necessar...|$|E

40|$|The {{expansion}} of urban areas {{has a negative}} impact on the environment. The increase of impervious or <b>sealed</b> <b>surfaces</b> is directly proportional to this expansion. The estimation of <b>sealed</b> <b>surfaces</b> has often been executed using remote sensing imagery, although only on a local to regional scale, using medium and recently available high resolution images like LANDSAT TM and IKONOS. In order to develop a global policy and strategy on urban expansion matters, consistent time series of area statistics on urban land use on a national and global level will become indispensable. This research explores the possibilities of SPOT VEGETATION imagery, with a spatial resolution of 1 km, for urban monitoring in order to generate statistics of <b>sealed</b> <b>surfaces</b> over larger zones. While low resolution imagery offers the advantage of covering a large area in small temporal intervals, its spatial resolution is too coarse to monitor most urban objects. In order to tackle this problem, a sub-pixel classification was applied and unmixed <b>sealed</b> <b>surface</b> area statistics were produced. Endmember selection is a key element in the sub-pixel classification process in which the spectrally complex <b>sealed</b> <b>surface</b> class should be distinguished from other general classes. To find the most favourable temporal interval or period for endmember selection, several datasets were developed and explored. SPOT-VEGETATION images were acquired in summer and winter for Flanders (Belgium). This region is characterised by a highly fragmented urban land-cover and large availability of reference data. Spectral unmixing of the multitemporal datasets illustrates that the endmember spectra differs for three different endmember selection techniques, affecting the quality of the final sub-pixel classification.
