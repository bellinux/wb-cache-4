40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of sophiite, Zn 2 (SeO 3) Cl 2 (a = 10. 251 (4), b = 15. 223 (2), c = 7. 666 (5) A, Z = 8) was solved in space group Pccn from single crystal X-ray data, and refined to R = 0. 053 for 666 Fo> 4 op,. The mineral belongs to layer compounds. The threefold coordinated Se atom {{is at the}} apex of a pyramid, the base of which is formed by three O atoms; Se-O = 1. 69 ~. Zn cations occupy two positions with distorted tetrahedral nd octahedral coordinations. In the tetrahedra, Zn cations are surrounded by two O (2. 02 A) and two Ci (2. 224 ~) atoms. Zn octahedra contain four O atoms (2. 07 A) and two CI atoms (2. 701 ~). The atomic arrangement is characterized byrings containing two Se pyramids linked by their corners to two Zn tetrahedra. The rings are linked by their edges and corners to Zn octahedra toform layers parallel to (010). The layers are interconnected byresidual Van der Waals bonds. Experimental results on thermal phase transformations and deformations, crystal optics and other physical properties of sophiite are presented. A structural aspect of their anisotropy is discussed. KEYWOROS: sophiite, {{crystal structure}}, Tolbachik volcano, Kamchatka. Occurrence and paragenesis SOPHIITE is the first selenium-bearing mineral occurring as a result of fumarolic activity of the Tolbachik Main Fracture Eruption, Kamchatka, Russia (Fedotov, 1984). The mineral occurs at a temperature of 180 - 230 ~ on lava flows in the <b>second</b> <b>slag</b> cone of the North Break as well as in a fumarolic field of a slag cone of the South Break (Vergasova et al., 1989). Associated minerals are cotton-like hygroscopic emanations bearing zinc and chlorine which, together with sophiite, fill small fractures and interstices between clasts of igneous rocks. Besides ophiite and white cotton-like emanations, in products of fumarolic activity confined to linear subsidences in the second cone...|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  5 c, the {{reaction}} degree of slag in ternary blended paste {{is similar to}} that in cement-slag binary blended paste. First, decreasing of CH content in ternary blended paste will lower the reaction rate of <b>slag.</b> <b>Second,</b> the dilution effect of limestone will increase the capillary water concentration in ternary blends, and increase the reaction rate of slag. Due to the combined actions of increasing factor and decreasing factor, the reaction degree of slag in ternary blended paste is similar with that of binary blended paste. Weerdt et al. (2011) also reported that similar experimental results (the reaction degree of fly ash in cement-fly ash-limestone ternary paste is almost same as that in fly ash blended ternary paste).|$|R
40|$|The {{project scope}} {{consists}} of collecting a 20 -ton sample of slag (primary slag), processing it for chart removal, and subjecting it to pyroprocessing to produce expanded slag aggregates of various size gradations and unit weights, ranging from 12 to 50 lb/fg{sup 3 }. A <b>second</b> smaller <b>slag</b> sample {{will be used}} for confirmatory testing. The expanded slag aggregates will then be tested for their suitability in manufacturing precast concrete products (e. g., masonry blocks and roof tiles) and insulating concrete, first at the laboratory scale and subsequently in commercial manufacturing plants. These products will be evaluated using ASTM and industry test methods. Technical data generated during production and testing of the products will be used to assess the overall technical viability of expanded slag production. In addition, a market assessment will be made based on an evaluation of both the expanded slag aggregates and the final products, and market prices for these products will be established in order to assess the economic viability of these utilization technologies. Relevant cost data for physical and pyroprocessing of slag to produce expanded slag aggregates will be gathered for comparison with (1) the management and disposal costs for slag or similar wastes and (2) production costs for conventional materials which the slag aggregates would replace. This will form the basis for an overall economic evaluation of expanded slag utilization technologies...|$|R

Immediately after the grand final, Lindström released the coronation song [...] "Coming True" [...] which debuted at number 1 on the Swedish singles chart, held the top spot for seven weeks and was certified double platinum. His self-titled debut album Daniel Lindström was released in early December and this too hit number 1. It went on to be certified Platinum, selling over 50,000 copies. His <b>second</b> album Nån <b>slags</b> verklighet was released in August 2006 and peaked at number 3. Recorded completely in his native language, it was less successful than his debut but gained a gold certification. After over two years away from the music industry, Lindström's third album D-Day was released on January 29, 2009. Despite critical acclaim however, the album failed to achieve commercial success, peaking at number 25 and selling less than 5,000 copies.|$|R
40|$|Integrated-gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) {{technology}} is an emerging technology that utilizes coal for power generation {{and production of}} chemical feedstocks. However, the process generates large amounts of solid waste, consisting of vitrified ash (slag) and some unconverted carbon. Slag undergoes expansion and forms a lightweight material when subjected to controlled heating in a kiln. The potential exists for using expanded slag {{as a substitute for}} conventional lightweight aggregates (LWA). The technology to produce lightweight and ultra-lightweight aggregates (ULWA) from slag was subsequently developed. The project scope consists of collecting a 20 -ton sample of slag (primary slag), processing it for char removal, and subjecting it to pyroprocessing to produce expanded slag aggregates of various size gradations and unit weights, ranging from 12 to 50 lb/ft{sup 3 }.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effect and possibility of using Portland slag cement in the production of interlocking paving units. Paving units consist of two layers. Four mixes were cast. The first mix was the control mix, in which Portland cement was used in the two layers. In the <b>second</b> mix, Portland <b>slag</b> cement was used in the upper layer, Portland cement was used in the backing layer. In the third mix, Portland cement was placed in the upper layer, while Portland slag cement was used in the backing layer. Finally, in the fourth mix, Portland cement was fully replaced by Portland slag cement in both layers. Tests were carried out in order to investigate the properties of the manufactured specimens at ages 28 and 180 days, respectively. Compressive strength and abrasion resistance were conducted according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM C 140 and ASTM C 418). Water absorption, split tensile strength, abrasion resistance, as well as, skid resistance were performed according to both Egyptian Standard Specifications (ESS 4382) and European Standard (EN 1338). The Egyptian standard is identical with the European standard. The results indicate that it is feasible to use Portland slag cement in the manufacture of paving blocks as the conditions of the conducted tests were satisfied at age 180 days except for the minimum splitting tensile strength test...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experimental}} studies of metal solubility in slags were carried out at 1473 K (1200 °C). In the first one the solubility of lead in the PbO-ZnO-CaO-SiO 2 -“Fe 2 O 3 ” slag system under a reducing atmosphere (PCO/PCO 2 = 2. 45) was studied. In the <b>second</b> part, <b>slags</b> of the CaO-SiO 2 -“Fe 2 O 3 ” system were equilibrated with Pb - 1. 3 mass % Ag alloys under an inert atmosphere. In both cases the CaO/SiO 2 mass ratio was from 1. 0 to 1. 6 and Fe/SiO 2 mass ratio was 1. 1 and 1. 7. The lead solubility in the slags of both experimental parts diminishes with increasing the slag basicity (CaO/SiO 2) and diminishing the Fe/SiO 2 ratio. Lead oxide is the only compound that can be reduced under the reducing atmosphere and at the temperature at the tuyeres level, 1473 K. Silver solubility in slags decreases with increasing both CaO/SiO 2 and Fe/SiO 2 ratios in the slags of the CaO-SiO 2 -“Fe 2 O 3 ” system. Se realizaron dos estudios experimentales de solubilidad de metal en escorias a 1. 473 K (1. 200 °C). En el primero se estudió la solubilidad de plomo en el sistema PbO-ZnO-CaO-SiO 2 -“Fe 2 O 3 ” bajo una atmósfera reductora (PCO/PCO 2 = 2, 45). En la segunda parte, escorias del sistema CaO-SiO 2 -“Fe 2 O 3 ” fueron equilibradas con aleaciones Pb - 1, 3 % Ag en atmósfera inerte. En ambos casos la relación CaO/SiO 2 fue variada de 1. 0 a 1. 6 y la relación Fe/SiO 2 fue de 1, 1 y 1, 7. La solubilidad de plomo en las escorias de ambas etapas experimentales disminuye con el incremento de la basicidad (CaO/SiO 2) y la disminución de la relación Fe/SiO 2. El óxido de plomo es el único compuesto que puede ser reducido bajo la atmósfera reductora y a la temperatura en el nivel de las toberas del horno alto, 1. 473 K. La solubilidad de la plata en la escoria decrece con el aumento de las relaciones CaO/SiO 2 y Fe/SiO 2 en las escorias del sistema CaO-SiO 2 -“Fe 2 O 3 ”...|$|R
