5|$|During the flyby of July 14, 2005, the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) found a warm region {{near the}} south pole. Temperatures {{in this region}} ranged from 85–90 K, with small areas showing as high as , much too warm to be {{explained}} by solar heating, indicating that parts of the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> are heated from the interior of Enceladus. The presence of a subsurface ocean under the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> is now accepted, but it cannot explain {{the source of the}} heat, with an estimated heat flux of 200mW/m2, which is about 10 times higher than that from radiogenic heating alone.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, the Hubble Space Telescope {{detected}} {{water vapor}} plumes above the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> of Europa, one of Jupiter's Galilean moons.

40|$|The first {{maps are}} {{presented}} {{of the north}} and <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>regions</b> of Mars. The thermal properties of the midlatitude regions from - 60 deg to + 60 deg latitude were mapped in previous studies. The presented maps complete the mapping of entire planet. The maps for the north and <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>regions</b> were derived from Viking Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) observations. Best fit thermal inertias were determined by comparing the available IRTM 20 micron channel brightness within a given region to surface temperatures computed by a diurnal and seasonal thermal model. The model assumes no atmospheric contributions to the surface heat balance. The resulting maps of apparent thermal inertia and average IRTM measured solar channel lambert albedo for the north and <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>regions</b> from the poles to +/- 60 deg latitude...|$|R
40|$|The second Mercury {{encounter}} {{has resulted}} in the acquisition of about 360 pictures of the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>regions</b> which provide a reliable cartographic and geologic tie between {{the two sides of the}} planet photographed on the first encounter. Stereoscopic coverage of large areas of the southern hemisphere was obtained by combining Mercury 1 and 2 pictures taken at different viewing angles. The <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>regions</b> consist of heavily cratered terrain and intercrater plains interspersed with patches of smooth plains. No large areas of smooth plains similar to those surrounding Caloris occur in the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>regions.</b> No new types of terrain have been recognized, but lobate scarps are common. The second largest basin seen by Mariner 10 (∼ 600 -km diameter) has been confirmed on the new photography. At high solar elevations the surface displays an abundance of rays and rayed craters...|$|R
5|$|Enceladus {{is losing}} mass {{at a rate}} of 200kg/second. If mass loss at this rate {{continued}} for 4.5 Gyr, the satellite would have lost approximately 30% of its initial mass. A similar value is obtained by assuming that the initial densities of Enceladus and Mimas were equal. It suggests that tectonics in the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> is probably mainly related to subsidence and associated subduction caused by the process of mass loss.|$|E
5|$|These geyser observations, {{along with}} the finding of {{escaping}} internal heat and very few (if any) impact craters in the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>region,</b> show that Enceladus is currently geologically active. Like many other satellites in the extensive systems of the giant planets, Enceladus is trapped in an orbital resonance. Its resonance with Dione excites its orbital eccentricity, which is damped by tidal forces, tidally heating its interior, possibly driving the geological activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{expanded}} surface coverage {{provided by}} Cassini has {{allowed for the}} identification of additional regions of smooth plains, particularly on Enceladus's leading hemisphere (the side of Enceladus that faces the direction of motion as it orbits Saturn). Rather than being covered in low-relief ridges, this region is covered in numerous criss-crossing sets of troughs and ridges, similar to the deformation seen in the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>region.</b> This area is {{on the opposite side}} of Enceladus from Sarandib and Diyar Planitiae, suggesting that the placement of these regions is influenced by Saturn's tides on Enceladus.|$|E

5|$|Following Voyager's {{encounters}} with Enceladus {{in the early}} 1980s, scientists postulated {{that it may be}} geologically active based on its young, reflective surface and location near the core of the Ering. Based on the connection between Enceladus and the Ering, scientists suspected that Enceladus was the source of material in the Ering, perhaps through venting of water vapor. Readings from Cassini's 2005 passage suggested that cryovolcanism, where water and other volatiles are the materials erupted instead of silicate rock, had been discovered on Enceladus. The first Cassini sighting of a plume of icy particles above Enceladus's south pole came from the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) images taken in January and February 2005, though the possibility of a camera artifact delayed an official announcement. Data from the magnetometer instrument during the February 17, 2005, encounter provided a hint that the feature might be real when it found evidence for a planetary atmosphere. The magnetometer observed an increase in the power of ion cyclotron waves near Enceladus. These waves are produced by the interaction of ionized particles and magnetic fields, and the waves' frequency can be used to identify their composition, in this case ionized water vapor. During the two following encounters, the magnetometer team determined that gases in Enceladus's atmosphere are concentrated over the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>region,</b> with atmospheric density away from the pole being much lower. The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) confirmed this result by observing two stellar occultations during the February 17 and July 14 encounters. Unlike the magnetometer, UVIS failed to detect an atmosphere above Enceladus during the February encounter when it looked over the equatorial region, but did detect water vapor during an occultation over the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> during the July encounter.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} of the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> {{is marked by a}} pattern of parallel, Y- and V-shaped ridges and valleys. The shape, orientation, and location of these features suggest they are caused by changes in the overall shape of Enceladus. As of 2006 there were two theories for what could cause such a shift in shape: the orbit of Enceladus may have migrated inward, leading to an increase in Enceladus's rotation rate. Such a shift would lead to a more oblate shape; or a rising mass of warm, low-density material in Enceladus's interior may have led to a shift in the position of the current south polar terrain from Enceladus's southern mid-latitudes to its south pole. Consequently, the moon's ellipsoid shape would have adjusted to match the new orientation. One problem of the polar flattening hypothesis is that both polar regions should have similar tectonic deformation histories. However, the north polar region is densely cratered, and has a much older surface age than the south pole. Thickness variations in Enceladus's lithosphere is one explanation for this discrepancy. Variations in lithospheric thickness are supported by the correlation between the Y-shaped discontinuities and the V-shaped cusps along the south polar terrain margin and the relative surface age of the adjacent non-south polar terrain regions. The Y-shaped discontinuities, and the north-south trending tension fractures into which they lead, are correlated with younger terrain with presumably thinner lithospheres. The V-shaped cusps are adjacent to older, more heavily cratered terrains.|$|E

(A group of similar – and larger – features were sighted in the north polar region in February 2007.) The possibility that these sea-sized features are either completely or partially filled with liquid hydrocarbons is significantly strengthened by subsequent observations by other Cassini instruments.|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of climate changes, induced by orbital oscillations, on Martian surface heat flow. It was found that the climatological component of the surface heat flow can be larger than the expected internal geothermal heat flow. We suggest that measurements of surface heat flow be targeted for equatorial and <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>regions</b> to avoid climatic effects and that care be taken in interpreting measurements in mid-latitude and north <b>polar</b> <b>regions...</b>|$|R
25|$|Mars has ice caps at {{its north}} pole and south pole, which mainly consist of water ice; however, there is frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice) present on their surfaces. Dry ice accumulates {{in the north}} polar region (Planum Boreum) in winter only, {{subliming}} completely in summer, while the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> additionally has a permanent dry ice cover up to eight meters (25feet) thick. This difference {{is due to the}} higher elevation of the south pole.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of this variability {{is believed to}} occur due {{to changes in the}} viewing geometry. Uranus is an oblate spheroid, which causes its visible area to become larger when viewed from the poles. This explains in part its brighter appearance at solstices. Uranus is also known to exhibit strong meridional variations in albedo (see above). For instance, the <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>region</b> of Uranus is much brighter than the equatorial bands. In addition, both poles demonstrate elevated brightness in the microwave part of the spectrum, whereas the polar stratosphere is known to be cooler than the equatorial one. So seasonal change seems to happen as follows: poles, which are bright both in visible and microwave spectral bands, come into the view at solstices resulting in brighter planet, whereas the dark equator is visible mainly near equinoxes resulting in darker planet. In addition, occultations at solstices probe hotter equatorial stratosphere.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} some reasons to believe that {{seasonal}} changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus {{is known to have}} a bright <b>south</b> <b>polar</b> <b>region,</b> the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above. During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim. This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox. Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes of brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the albedo patterns. In addition, the microwave data showed increases in pole–equator contrast after the 1986 solstice. Finally in the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright), whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity, such as cloud formations and stronger winds, having bolstered expectations that it would brighten soon. In particular, an analog of the bright polar collar present in its southern hemisphere at −45° was expected to appear in its northern part. This indeed happened in 2007 when Uranus passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, whereas the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained asymmetric, with northern winds being slightly slower than southern.|$|E

40|$|Specific {{reference}} {{figures are}} recommended for consistent use in geophysics and geodesy.

500|$|In 2006, NASA {{reported}} that Cassini had {{found evidence of}} liquid water reservoirs that erupt in geysers on Saturn's moon Enceladus.

The November 2005 images showed the plume's fine structure, revealing numerous jets (perhaps issuing from numerous distinct vents) within a larger, faint component extending out nearly 500km from the surface. The particles have a bulk velocity of 1.25 ±0.1km/s, and a maximum velocity of Mach 10 (3.40km/s).
