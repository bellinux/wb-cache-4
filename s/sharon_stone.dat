5|$|In April 2007, The Guardian {{reported}} that British screenwriter Rupert Walters {{was writing a}} movie based on Riefenstahl's life which would star actress Jodie Foster. The project did not receive Riefenstahl's approval prior to her death, as Riefenstahl asked for a veto on any scenes to which she did not agree. Riefenstahl also wanted <b>Sharon</b> <b>Stone</b> to play her rather than Foster, which ultimately resulted in the cancellation of the project.|$|E

5|$|The town of Redemption was {{designed}} by Patrizia von Brandenstein, known for her work on Amadeus (1984) and The Untouchables (1987).

Instead, Sony chose The Computer Film Company to create the VFX sequences. Pick-up scenes took place through November - December 1994. This included an extended duel between <b>Sharon</b> <b>Stone</b> and Gene Hackman.|$|E

5|$|DiCaprio's first {{effort of}} 1995 was Sam Raimi's The Quick and the Dead, a western film. Sony Pictures was dubious over DiCaprio's casting, {{and as a}} result, co-star <b>Sharon</b> <b>Stone</b> decided to pay the actor's salary herself. The film was {{released}} to a dismal box office performance, barely grossing US$18.5 million in the US, and received mixed reviews from critics. DiCaprio next starred in Total Eclipse, a fictionalized account of the homosexual relationship between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. He replaced River Phoenix, who died during pre-production on the project. A minor art-house success, the film grossed US$0.34 million throughout its domestic theatrical run.|$|E

500|$|The {{opening of}} Part Two, wherein Smithers {{realizes that he}} merely dreamed about {{shooting}} Mr. Burns, is {{a reference to the}} episode [...] "Blast from the Past" [...] from Dallas, in which the events of the entire ninth season were explained away as being merely a character's dream. The dream itself, in which Smithers and Burns are undercover detectives on the 1960s Speedway racing circuit, parodied The Mod Squad.

5000|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{mentioned}} the controversy in his review, saying [...] "As for the allegedly offensive homosexual characters: The movie's protesters might {{take note of}} the fact that this film's heterosexuals, starting with Douglas, are equally offensive. Still, there is a point to be made about Hollywood's unremitting insistence on typecasting homosexuals - particularly lesbians - as twisted and evil." [...] Camille Paglia denounced gay activist and feminist protests against Basic Instinct, and called <b>Sharon</b> <b>Stone's</b> performance [...] "one of the great performances by a woman in screen history", praising her character as [...] "a great vamp figure, like Mona Lisa herself, like a pagan goddess".|$|R

25|$|Seven years later, Crichton {{published}} Sphere, a novel which {{relates the}} story of psychologist Norman Johnson, who is required by the U.S. Navy to join {{a team of scientists}} assembled by the U.S. Government to examine an enormous alien spacecraft discovered on the bed of the Pacific Ocean, and believed to have been there for over 300 years. The novel begins as a science fiction story, but rapidly changes into a psychological thriller, ultimately exploring the nature of the human imagination. The novel was adapted into the film Sphere in 1998, directed by Barry Levinson, with a cast including Dustin Hoffman as Norman Johnson, (renamed Norman Goodman), Samuel L.

25|$|Casino (1995), like The Age of Innocence before it, {{focused on}} a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is {{disrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to fans of the director who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. Casino was a box office success, but the film received mixed notices from critics. In large part this was due to its huge stylistic similarities to his earlier Goodfellas, and its excessive violence that garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film ever made. Indeed, many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Pesci once again playing an unbridled psychopath. <b>Sharon</b> <b>Stone</b> was nominated for the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance. During the filming Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.|$|E

Her film career reached its peak {{by the beginning of}} the 1960s, and she achieved later success with her television role as Constance MacKenzie on Peyton Place from 1964 to 1968. Less active in her later years, Malone returned to films in 1992 as the friend of <b>Sharon</b> <b>Stone's</b> character in Basic Instinct.|$|R

[...] and [...] "From now on, we're going to unleash the truth about her". Lee spoofs <b>Sharon</b> <b>Stone's</b> interrogation scene from the 1992 film Basic Instinct. According to the singer's agency, {{two versions of the}} music video, a story-centered one and a choreography-centered one, would be released.
