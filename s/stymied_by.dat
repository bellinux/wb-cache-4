5|$|Heading into halftime losing 24–3, the team, led by Sanchez, {{engineered}} {{a comeback}} following a heartfelt speech {{given by the}} quarterback at halftime. Although the Jets' defense did not allow Pittsburgh to score in the second half, the team fell short as their final offensive drive was <b>stymied</b> <b>by</b> the Steelers' defense and the Jets lost 24–19.|$|E
5|$|After Philippi, a new {{territorial}} {{arrangement was}} made {{among the members}} of the Second Triumvirate. Gaul and the provinces of Hispania and Italia were placed in the hands of Octavian. Antony traveled east to Egypt where he allied himself with Queen Cleopatra VII, the former lover of Julius Caesar and mother of Caesar's infant son Caesarion. Lepidus was left with the province of Africa, <b>stymied</b> <b>by</b> Antony, who conceded Hispania to Octavian instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, Harrison and Gresham {{competed for}} {{influence}} at the 1884 Republican National Convention; the delegation ended up supporting James G. Blaine, the eventual nominee. In the Senate, Harrison achieved passage of his Dependent Pension Bill, {{only to see}} it vetoed by President Grover Cleveland. His efforts to further the admission of new western states were <b>stymied</b> <b>by</b> Democrats, who feared that the new states would elect Republicans to Congress.|$|E
50|$|The Chifley Government was {{determined}} that post-war aviation would be a state monopoly. Its legislation was <b>stymied,</b> however, <b>by</b> the Airline Operators Secretariat, which argued that the Constitution guaranteed freedom of commerce between states. The High Court agreed in its Airlines Case decision.|$|R
50|$|Any {{plans of}} further electoral success were <b>stymied</b> only <b>by</b> {{his death in}} 1963. Thirty years after his {{departure}} from the ALP, he was still disliked by many Laborites with long memories. Ross McMullin, in his history of the Labor Party, The Light on the Hill, describes {{him as one of}} the worst Labor leaders federally or in any state.|$|R
5000|$|While evading {{authorities}} {{for over three}} years, Casso maintained control over the Lucchese family. In the process, he ordered 11 mob slayings as well as plotting with Genovese leader Vincent [...] "the Chin" [...] Gigante to murder John Gotti. Casso and Gigante were deeply disgusted that Gotti had murdered Paul Castellano without the sanction of the Mafia's Commission. All attempts on Gotti's life were <b>stymied,</b> however, <b>by</b> the constant presence of news reporters around the Gambino boss.|$|R
5|$|It {{was also}} {{intended}} to develop reconnaissance and bomber versions, but these plans were disrupted by the German invasion in June 1941. The project was <b>stymied</b> <b>by</b> {{the failure of}} its intended inline engine, the Mikulin AM-37, and its performance was disappointing when a second prototype was built later with M-82 radial engines. It was cancelled in 1943 after at least two prototypes were built.|$|E
5|$|Several twentieth-century writers {{explored}} {{possibilities of}} wheeled creatures. L. Frank Baum's 1907 children's novel Ozma of Oz features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers. Their wheels {{are composed of}} keratin, which has been suggested by biologists {{as a means of}} avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels. Despite moving quickly on open terrain, the Wheelers are <b>stymied</b> <b>by</b> obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs, and they cannot cross sand.|$|E
5|$|Mississippi scored another {{touchdown}} before halftime, and the Hokies {{clung to}} a 17–14 lead {{at the beginning}} of the second half. That three-point lead quickly evaporated, however, as 21seconds into the third quarter, Mississippi's Steve Hindman ran for 79yards and a touchdown to give Mississippi a 21–17 lead. Ole Miss added 13 more points before the game was over and earned the victory, 34–17. The Virginia Tech offense was <b>stymied</b> <b>by</b> repeated turnovers. Tech fumbled the ball threetimes and Tech quarterback Humphries threw twointerceptions. Tech committed 120yards in penalties and was held to just twopassing yards for the entire game.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there were a}} number of {{unfavorable}} reviews. Stephen Holden of The New York Times did not give the film a very favorable review, criticizing the film's sense of humor by calling it [...] "only as broad as the Mona Lisa's smile" [...] and criticizing Affleck's portrayal of Jim. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly awarded the film a grade of C-, writing that director Steve Buscemi [...] "is <b>stymied</b> here <b>by</b> the inertia of his material".|$|R
50|$|The Raiders were <b>stymied</b> {{almost totally}} <b>by</b> the Jaguars in Week 16. The Raiders defense allowed seven touchdowns: two passing TDs each from David Garrard and Jaguars backup QB Quinn Gray, and three rushing TDs. The Raiders only managed 215 yards of total offense.|$|R
50|$|Ryan Gracie, who {{had fought}} on the same card and emerged victorious, issued a {{challenge}} to Sakuraba and the two were subsequently scheduled to meet at Pride 12 - Cold Fury. Due to a shoulder injury, the fight was limited to a single 10-minute round, where Ryan's spirited efforts were generally <b>stymied</b> and controlled <b>by</b> Sakuraba, who noticeably avoided attacks on his younger opponent's injured arm.|$|R
5|$|On the ground, Auburn {{running back}} Ronnie Brown led all rushers with 68yards on 14carries. Second was Auburn's Carnell Williams, who gained 61yards on 19carries. Bryan Randall was the Hokies' leading rusher, accumulating 45yards on nine carries. Tech's two running backs, Mike Imoh and Cedric Humes, were <b>stymied</b> <b>by</b> the Auburn defense and managed just 26yards on 12combined carries. Virginia Tech wide {{receiver}} Josh Morgan finished {{the game with}} three receptions for 126yards and two touchdowns, making him the game's most prolific receiver. Auburn's Courtney Taylor was second, with five catches for 87yards, and Tech's Josh Hyman was third with five catches for 71yards.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{signing the}} Kano Accord, Libya was incensed that the GUNT {{did not include}} any {{of the leaders of}} the Volcan Army and had not {{recognized}} Libyan claims on the Aouzou Strip. Since 13 April there had been some minor Libyan military activity in northern Chad, and support was provided to the secessionist movement in the south. However, a major response came only after 25 June, when the ultimatum of Chad's neighbors for the formation of a new, more inclusive coalition government expired. On 26 June, 2,500 Libyan troops invaded Chad, heading for Faya-Largeau. The Chadian government appealed for French help. The Libyan forces were first <b>stymied</b> <b>by</b> Goukouni's militiamen, and then forced to retreat by French reconnaissance planes and bombers. In the same month, the factions excluded by the GUNT founded a counter-government, the Front for Joint Provisional Action (FACP), in northern Chad with Libyan military support.|$|E
5|$|Each cavalry {{regiment}} was {{to consist}} of four cavalry squadrons, a machine gun squadron, and an engineer squadron. Shortly before the war, an abortive {{attempt was made to}} motorise the 1st Cavalry Division, but this was <b>stymied</b> <b>by</b> a lack of motor transport and the division largely remained a horsed formation throughout its existence. The 1st Cavalry Division was also never equipped with the planned motorised anti-tank battery, and the divisional artillery battalion was largely equipped with World War I-vintage pieces. Two peacetime components of the division, the 2nd Cavalry Brigade and 3rd Cavalry Regiment, were earmarked to join other formations when they were mobilised, so the primary fighting formation of the 1st Cavalry Division was the 1st Cavalry Brigade, commanding the 2nd, 6th and 8th Cavalry Regiments.|$|E
40|$|Aluminium {{adjuvants}} potentiate {{the immune}} response, thereby ensuring the potency {{and efficacy of}} typically sparingly available antigen. Their concomitant critical importance in mass vaccination programmes may have prompted recent intense interest in understanding how they work and their safety. Progress in these areas is <b>stymied,</b> however, <b>by</b> a lack of accessible knowledge pertaining to the bioinorganic chemistry of aluminium adjuvants, and, consequently, the inappropriate application and interpretation of experimental models of their mode of action. The objective herein is, therefore, to identify the many ways that aluminium chemistry contributes to the wide and versatile armoury of its adjuvants, such that future research might be guided towards a fuller understanding of their role in human vaccinations...|$|R
25|$|The Uptown Theatre is {{currently}} closed {{and in a}} state of decay, but efforts have been made by Friends of the Uptown and other local groups to halt deterioration, restore and reopen the theater. Progress was <b>stymied</b> for years <b>by</b> various legal issues, including disputes by multiple mortgage holders and city liens. However, on August 18, 2008, the Uptown Theatre was sold to Jam Productions Ltd, a Chicago-based music promoter. Jam Productions plans to restore the building and will seek development funds from the City of Chicago to help with this effort.|$|R
40|$|It would {{valuable}} to have early warning of disruptions to the Internet. One aspect of Internet function is the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which handles {{the delivery of}} packets between various autonomous domains. In particular, autonomous routers use BGP communications for “announcements ” and “withdrawals”, that is, to announce the detected availability or unavailability of various Internet routes. Certain statistics of these announcements and withdrawals might be useful in dis-tinguishing between normal and abnormal operation of the Internet[3]. Practical use of these statistics in real-time monitoring is <b>stymied,</b> however, <b>by</b> the need for robust pattern recognition methods that can operate under conditions of extreme skew. In other words, the disruptions, though critical when they occur, nonetheless are occuring {{only a tiny fraction}} of the time: in the last decade of Internet activity, there has been roughly twenty cumulative days of “disruption”, an incidence rate of 0. 5 %. This problem of imbalanced data afflicts many applications, and is becoming even more prevalent as data volumes grow. “Bagged ” ensembles of decision trees have been shown to be a simple, robust an...|$|R
5|$|For five months, Henry took {{no action}} on the accusations against his archbishop. The {{conspiracy}} was finally revealed to Cranmer by the king himself. According to Cranmer's secretary, Ralph Morice, sometime in September 1543 the king showed Cranmer a paper summarising the accusations against him. An investigation was to be mounted and Cranmer was appointed chief investigator. Surprise raids were carried out, evidence gathered, and ringleaders identified. Typically, Cranmer put the clergymen involved in the conspiracy through immediate humiliation, but he eventually forgave them and continued to use their services. To show his trust in Cranmer, Henry gave Cranmer his personal ring. When the Privy Council arrested Cranmer {{at the end of}} November, the nobles were <b>stymied</b> <b>by</b> the symbol of the king's trust in him. Cranmer's victory ended with two second-rank leaders imprisoned and Germain Gardiner executed.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Sir Norman Brook {{attempted}} to have Gowing {{retained in the}} Cabinet Office as the permanent historian, but was <b>stymied</b> <b>by</b> the Treasury and the Civil Service Commission. In 1951, she was told {{that she had no}} chance of being appointed to the grade of Principal, which would have carried retirement benefits with it. She later said that her years at the Cabinet Office were the happiest of her life, but she began looking for another position. In 1955, she applied for a chair in economic history at Oxford, and for a position as a reader at LSE, but was unsuccessful. Sir Norman exploited various administrative loopholes to allow her to be retained at the Cabinet Office, and was prepared to make her the Cabinet Office Archivist, but he could not offer her a pension.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Cincinnati 28-yard line, and the Bearcats' offense began its first possession of the second quarter. Pike threw an incomplete pass, then connected on a 10-yard throw for a first down. That gain was countered on the next play by a 10-yard holding penalty against the Bearcats. Cincinnati was unable to regain the yardage lost to the penalty and punted. Following the kick, Virginia Tech was similarly <b>stymied</b> <b>by</b> consecutive penalties and a sack of Taylor by Cincinnati's Terrill Byrd. Tech punted, and the kick {{was returned}} by Cincinnati wide receiver D.J. Woods to the Virginia Tech 45-yard line. Despite starting in Virginia Tech's half of the field, Cincinnati was unable to capitalize and went three and out. The Bearcats' punt was downed at the Virginia Tech three-yard line, and the Hokies' offense returned to the field.|$|E

40|$|Expanded space {{utilization}} {{for exploration}} or exploitation has been <b>stymied</b> partially <b>by</b> {{the high cost}} of space access. These high costs are driven primarily by the technical challenge of space flight and the low launch rates. Since the Apollo era, numerous efforts have been under taken to significantly reduce the cost of space access. The assumption has been that development of a low cost launch system will stimulate demand, enabling new uses of space for the betterment of mankind. The retirement of the space shuttle and the transition to the VSE provides a unique opportunity for America to encourage competitive, commercial launch resulting in a stronger, healthier, more robust launch industry. Such a robust, commercial launch industry reduces launch costs for all. This unique opportunity consists of opening the ISS service requirements and elements of the exploration program to commercial competition. Combined, the ISS servicing and exploration launch requirements offer the opportunity to increase America’s competitive launch demand by more than a factor of four. Such a huge increase in launch demand offers the opportunity to provide a solid foundation from which industry can make investment decisions and dramatically lower cost...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{assesses the}} legal {{challenges}} that cities can face {{in trying to}} deal with predatory lending. Part I provides an overview of the problem. Part II focuses on the common law and statutory claims that cities might bring, with particular emphasis on the evidentiary isses that cities can face and the requirements of standing that could severely limit the effectiveness of lawsuits brought by municipalities. The Article then turns to city efforts to regulate predatory lending pursuant to their home rule authority, efforts than can be <b>stymied</b> both <b>by</b> state laws that supersede municipal ordinances and federal regulations that preempt state and local initiatives. Part III focuses on home rule, explaining that most courts that have addressed the question have held municipal initiatives to be preempted by state laws. Part IV shows that the federal government might override much of what cities and states try to do to attack the problem. The Article concludes that, despite the legal obstacles facing cities that want to regulate predatory lending, local efforts have served as a catalyst for predatory lending policies at the state level and might stimulate more effective national policies as well...|$|R
5|$|As these {{secondary}} {{objectives were}} attacked, a single glider landed {{on top of}} the Fort, from which emerged Oberleutnant Rudolf Witzig. After his glider had unintentionally landed in German territory, he had radioed for another tug, and it landed in the field with a replacement glider. Once the airborne troops had broken down fences and hedges obstructing the aircraft, they boarded the new glider and were towed through anti-aircraft fire to the fort. Having achieved their primary objectives of disabling the artillery pieces possessed by the fort, the airborne troops then held it against Belgian counter-attacks, which began almost immediately. These counter-attacks were made by Belgian infantry formations without artillery support and were uncoordinated. This allowed the airborne troops to repel them with machine-gun fire. Artillery from several smaller Forts nearby and Belgian field artillery units also targeted the airborne troops, but this too was uncoordinated and achieved nothing and often aided the airborne troops in repelling counter-attacks by Belgian infantry units. Patrols were also used to ensure that the garrison stayed in the interior of the fort and did not attempt to emerge and mount an attempt to retake the fort. Any attempt by the garrison to launch a counter-attack would have been <b>stymied</b> <b>by</b> the fact that the only possible route for such an attack was up a single, spiral staircase, and any embrasures looking out onto the Fort had either been captured or disabled. The plan for the assault had called for Group Granite to be relieved by 51st Engineer Battalion within a few hours of seizing the Fort, but the Group was not actually relieved until 7:00 on 11 May. Heavy Belgian resistance, as well as several demolished bridges over the River Meuse, had forced the battalion to lay down new bridges, delaying it significantly. Once the airborne troops had been relieved, the battalion, in conjunction with an infantry regiment that arrived shortly after the engineers, mounted an attack on the main entrance to the fort. Faced with this attack, the garrison surrendered at 12:30, suffering sixty men killed and forty wounded. The Germans captured more than a thousand Belgian soldiers. Group Granite suffered six killed and nineteen wounded.|$|E

50|$|When Kiam and Sullivan {{tried to}} sell the team to {{interests}} in Jacksonville, Kraft effectively <b>stymied</b> the deal <b>by</b> refusing to let the team out of an ironclad commitment {{to serve as the}} stadium's main tenant until 2001. As a result, when Kiam himself was crippled by financial troubles, he sold the Patriots to James Orthwein in 1992. After only two seasons, Orthwein tried {{to get out of the}} lease in order to clear the way for the Patriots to move to St. Louis, but Kraft refused to let the Patriots out of their lease. Orthwein then put the team on the market. However, due to the wording of the operating covenant, any prospective buyer would have had to negotiate with Kraft. With this in mind, Kraft swooped in and bought the team himself.|$|R

50|$|The SR-71, {{while much}} more capable than the Lockheed U-2 {{in terms of}} range, speed, and survivability, {{suffered}} {{the lack of a}} data link, which the U-2 had been upgraded to carry. This meant that much of the SR-71's imagery and radar data could not be used in real time, but had to wait until the aircraft returned to base. This lack of immediate real-time capability was used as one of the justifications to close down the program. Attempts to add a datalink to the SR-71 were <b>stymied</b> early on <b>by</b> same factions in the Pentagon and Congress who were already set on the program's demise, even in the early 1980s. These same factions also forced expensive sensor upgrades to the SR-71, which did little to increase its mission capabilities, but could be used as justification for complaining about the cost of the program.|$|R

40|$|By {{precisely}} {{manipulating the}} expression of individual genetic elements thought to be important for ecological performance, reverse genetics {{has the potential to}} revolutionize plant ecology. However, untested concerns about possible side-effects of the transformation technique, caused by Agrobacterium infection and tissue culture, on plant performance have <b>stymied</b> research <b>by</b> requiring onerous sample sizes. We compare 5 independently transformed Nicotiana attenuata lines harboring empty vector control (EVC) T-DNA lacking silencing information with isogenic wild types (WT), and measured a battery of ecologically relevant traits, known to be important in plant-herbivore interactions: phytohormones, secondary metabolites, growth and fitness parameters under stringent competitive conditions, and transcriptional regulation with microarrays. As a positive control, we included a line silenced in trypsin proteinase inhibitor gene (TPI) expression, a potent anti-herbivore defense known to exact fitness costs in its expression, in the analysis. The experiment was conducted twice, with 10 and 20 biological replicates per genotype. For all parameters, we detected no difference between any EVC and WT lines, but could readily detect a fitness benefit of silencing TPI production. A statistical power analyses revealed that the minimum sample sizes required for detecting significant fitness differences between EVC and WT was 2 - 3 orders of magnitude larger than the 10 replicates required to detect a fitness effect of TPI silencing. We conclude that possible side-effects of transformation are far too low to obfuscate the study of ecologically relevant phenotypes...|$|R
40|$|Adults and Technology 2 The {{proliferation}} {{of technology and}} online learning has created a wealth of learning opportunities for educational institutions, businesses and adult learners. As more and more adult learners seek to gain knowledge through formal and informal training delivered through self-paced distance learning, barriers to successful learning continue to crop up {{and have to be}} dealt with by instructional designers. Because computer-based learning involves learning both a the system of content delivery and the content itself, many adult learners are <b>stymied</b> and frustrated <b>by</b> the learning system due to a lack of prior experience with technology and assistance from course instructors. This paper outlines the factors that cause “technophobia ” or computer anxiety in adult learners, and suggests several methods of coping with that anxiety so that it does not cripple the adult learner. Preparing them to utilize the technology involved in a non-threatening context that will allow them to succeed is critical to foster positive attitudes in adults towards technology and learning...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Despite policy {{commitments}} and legislated mechanisms, {{the system of}} participatory democracy in post- 1994 South Africa is largely considered to have failed. In order to understand how underlying ideas can help to explain weaknesses in practice, this article examines how participatory democracy is understood by the ruling African National Congress (ANC). It shows that the multiple intellectual traditions shaping the participatory model {{have led to a}} set of policy initiatives that are not without internal tension. In part, the technocratic creep associated with improving public sector performance has <b>stymied</b> participatory efforts <b>by</b> placing efficiency and delivery over democracy and empowerment. Alongside this, however, the ANC’s own conception of ‘democracy’ remains interwoven with its mass movement history – linking the role of popular participation to the extension of its own hegemony. The intent of policy to deepen democracy through structures of participatory governance is thus undermined by a teleological framing of participation as an intra-movement activity...|$|R
