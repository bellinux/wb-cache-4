40|$|The eradicative {{effect of}} two strobilurin {{fungicides}} (kresoxim-methyl and trifloxystrobin) and difenoconazole on activity of apple <b>scab</b> <b>spots</b> was studied in greenhouse and field conditions. The reaction of mycelium and sporulation of Venturia inaequalis after fungicides applications {{were observed in}} light and scanning electron microscope. Mixture of strobilurin fungicide and difenoconazole applied twice, in 5 days interval, gave the best eradicative effect. The inhibition of sporulation was long lasting and it was observed even 3 and 5 weeks after treatments. The conidiophores, conidia and mycelium were damaged. Also difenoconazole showed good eradicative activity, in field condition up to 5 weeks after application. Trifloxystrobin significantly {{reduced the number of}} active scab lesions and the effect was visible even 3 weeks after treatment. Kresoxim-methyl in both tested doses (0, 2 and 0, 3 kg/ha) was slightly less effective...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 English holly {{culture in}} Oregon has been {{threatened}} {{by the development of}} red leaf spots which prevent sale of cut holly. Chemical, mechanical and insect injury and boron deficiency have been shown in the past to cause different types of red leaf spotting, but the cause of holly scab, a widely prevalent type of red leaf spotting, had not been determined. The objectives of this study were to determine the cause of holly scab and to investigate the factors that influence its development. Holly <b>scab</b> <b>spots</b> are irregular, translucent, or red-black swollen areas principally on the lower leaf surface, although some varieties show spotting on both leaf surfaces. Observation of scab development on trees in a variety plot showed that the size and color of holly <b>scab</b> <b>spots</b> varies considerably on different varieties of holly. Green stem hollies appear to be as susceptible to scab as the brown or blue stem varieties but form less pigmentation. No promising resistant varieties were observed. Nutritional vigor of the host did not affect susceptibility to infection. When nitrogen, calcium or boron deficient plants and normal plants were exposed to natural inoculum in the field all plants became infected. Over 100 different organisms were isolated from leaves affected with holly scab and inoculation attempts were made with 28 of the isolates. Only a species of Sclerophoma produced holly scab. Attempts to identify the fungus repeatedly lead to Phoma and Phyllosticta. Because of significant differences from characteristics of these genera, however, cultures were sent to B. C. Sutton of the Commonwealth Mycological Institute for identification. Sutton acknowledged that the fungus was not a Phoma or Phyllosticta. He pointed out its similarity to Sclerophoma pithyophila (Cda.) Hohn. and listed it as a Sclerophoma species with accession number IMI 107649. The fungus in culture has pycnidia that are non-ostiolate, spherical to pyriform, ranging in size from 75 microns to 200 microns. Spores are hyaline, ovoid-oblong, guttulate, 2 - 4 x 5 - 7 microns with no visible sporophores at maturity but are embedded in a gelatinous matrix. The fungus grows slowly on streptomycin-PDA over a range of 15 ° to 25 ° C but does not grow at 30 ° C. It grew best on media with an initial pH from 4 to 7. The holly Sclerophoma did not sporulate under normal laboratory conditions, but sporulated readily when KNO₃ was used as a nitrogen source or following exposure to prolonged periods of near-ultraviolet. Sporulation has not been observed in infected leaves. Comparison of the holly Sclerophoma with descriptions of the Sclerophoma species listed by Grove showed distinct differences in host range and morphology which would support the establishment of a new species. Unfortunately cultures of other Sclerophoma species were not available for comparison, and further attempts to clarify the taxonomic status of the holly Sclerophoma are pending receipt of collections from Europe. Attempts to control the disease, with spring and summer sprays were inconclusive {{due to a lack of}} natural infection within the test plots, but provided information on three other non-pathogenic leaf-spots. Purple blotch is a physiological imbalance that shows only with the ripening of the berries and colder weather. Copper injury occurred when fixed copper was used at normal recommendations in spring and fall spray applications. Leaf spotting associated with summer application of nabam was observed and is being studied further...|$|E

40|$|Pear <b>scab,</b> {{or black}} <b>spot,</b> {{is caused by}} the fungus Venturia pirina. It infects leaves, shoots, {{blossoms}} and fruit, and can cause serious crop loss especially in wet seasons when control measures are inadequate.

The fungus is closely related to apple scab, but although many similarities exist, cross-infection from one host to the other cannot occur...|$|R
40|$|A {{new model}} has been {{developed}} for assessing day-to-day variation in risk of infection of apples by Venturia inaequalis, the <b>scab</b> or black <b>spot</b> pathogen. The model comprises three components, ascospore availability, wetness-based infection risk based on “Mills periods ” and susceptible leaf area. The ascospore and wetness-based infection risk components were adapted from previous models, whereas the susceptible leaf area component is new. When the model used weather data from Hawke’s Bay and Nelson in spring 2003, the predicted risk incidence was determined mostly by wetness-based infection risk, but the magnitude of risk periods was greatly influenced by predicted ascospore release. The susceptible leaf area component predicted a hitherto unidentified increase in infection risk, after the peak in ascospore maturation rate had occurred. The model is intended to assist in fungicide selection and timing for scab control in New Zealand apples, but needs to be field tested before implementation...|$|R
40|$|Mango (Mangifera indica L.) {{is universally}} {{considered}} one of the most important fruit crop in Egypt. Egypt produces 232, 000 tone of mangos annually and exports moderate amounts (1500 tones) to 20 countries in the near East and Europe, FAO, 2000. It is expected that commercial and backyard plantings of mango trees will continue to increase. Mango suffers from several diseases at all stages of its life. All the parts of the plant, namely, trunk, branch, twig, leaf, petiole, flower and fruit are attacked by a number of pathogens including fungi, bacteria and algae. They cause several kinds of rot, die back, anthracnose, malformation, <b>scab,</b> necrosis, blotch, <b>spots,</b> mildew, etc. This fact sheet concentrates on the symptoms of the important mango diseases, the weather conditions conducive to disease development, and methods for control. ANTHRACNOSE Anthracnose, the most important mango disease, is caused by the fungus Colletotrichum gleosporioides. Flower blight, fruit rot, and leaf spots are among the symptoms of this disease (Arauz, 2000). Infection...|$|R
40|$|Ascospores of Venturia inaequalis {{constitute}} the principal source of primary inoculum for epidemics of apple black <b>spot</b> (<b>scab).</b> Mathematical models that describe ascospore release {{have been developed}} in USA, New Zealand and Italy. These models are based upon degree-day accumulation. In this work, the seasonal pattern of released ascospores of V. inaequalis in Vacaria, Brazil, was evaluated. During four apple growth seasons (2009 to 2012) the natural release of ascospores from ive orchards was recorded. The cumulative percentage of ascospore release was predicted using three different degreeday models. The released ascospore data showed the best it to the model developed in Italy, with a start date of 22 August rather than the phenological stage of apple bud break. It is concluded that in regions with warm winter temperatures, models that use bud break to initiate ascospore maturation will tend to underestimate availability of ascospores {{at the beginning of}} the apple growth season. 201...|$|R
40|$|Species of Elsino€e are phytopathogens causing <b>scab</b> and <b>spot</b> {{anthracnose}} on many plants, {{including some}} economically important {{crops such as}} avocado, citrus, grapevines, and ornamentals such as poinsettias, field crops and woody hosts. Disease symptoms are often easily recognisable, and referred to as signaturebearing diseases, for the cork-like appearance of older infected tissues with scab-like appearance. In some Elsino€e-host associations the resulting symptoms are better described as spot anthracnose. Additionally the infected plants may also show mild to severe distortions of infected organs. Isolation of Elsino€e in pure culture can be very challenging and examination of specimens collected {{in the field is}} often frustrating {{because of the lack of}} fertile structures. Current criteria for species recognition and host specificity in Elsino€e are unclear due to overlapping morphological characteristics, and the lack of molecular and pathogenicity data. In the present study we revised the taxonomy of Elsino€e based on DNA sequence and morphological data derived from 119 isolates, representing 67 host genera from 17 countries, including 64 ex-type cultures. Combined analyses of ITS, LSU, rpb 2 and TEF 1 -α DNA sequence data were used to reconstruct the backbone phylogeny of the genus Elsino€e. Based on the single nomenclature for fungi, 26 new combinations are proposed in Elsino€e for species that were originally described in Sphaceloma. A total of 13 species are epitypified with notes on their taxonomy and phylogeny. A further eight new species are introduced, leading to a total of 75 Elsino€e species supported by molecular data in the present study. For the most part species of Elsino€e appear to be host specific, although the majority of the species treated are known only from a few isolates, and further collections and pathogenicity studies will be required to reconfirm this conclusion. This study was partially financed by the China Scholarship Council (CSC). [URL] and Plant Patholog...|$|R
40|$|Citrus {{exports to}} foreign markets are {{severely}} limited today by fruit diseases. Some of them, like citrus canker, black <b>spot</b> and <b>scab,</b> are quarantine for the markets. For this reason, {{it is important}} to perform strict controls before fruits are exported to avoid the inclusion of citrus affected by them. Nowadays, technical decisions are based on visual diagnosis of human experts, highly dependent on the degree of individual skills. This work presents a model capable of automatic recognize the quarantine diseases. It is based on the combination of a feature selection method and a classifier that has been trained on quarantine illness symptoms. Citrus samples with citrus canker, black <b>spot,</b> <b>scab</b> and other diseases were evaluated. Experimental work was performed on 212 samples of mandarins from a Nova cultivar. The proposed approach achieved a classification rate of quarantine/not-quarantine samples of over 83 % for all classes, even when using a small subset (14) of all the available features (90). The results obtained show that the proposed method can be suitable for helping the task of citrus visual diagnosis, in particular, quarantine diseases recognition in fruits. Fil: Stegmayer, Georgina.
