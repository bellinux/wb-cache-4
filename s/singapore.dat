5|$|Although XXBomber Command began {{preparations}} {{to attack}} on <b>Singapore</b> Naval Base again on 6February, this raid was cancelled {{on the third}} of the month by Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the commander of Allied forces in the Southeast Asian theatre. Mountbatten ordered that the naval installations at <b>Singapore</b> and Penang not be targeted as they would be needed by Allied forces following the projected liberation of Malaya and <b>Singapore</b> later in 1945. After requesting clarification of this order, Ramsey met with Mountbatten at Kandy. In this meeting Mountbatten assigned targets in the Kuala Lumpur area as XXBomber Command's first priority, while second priority was given to carefully selected areas of <b>Singapore.</b> These areas excluded the King GeorgeVI Graving Dock and several other docks and areas with heavy machinery, but allowed attacks on the West Wall area of <b>Singapore</b> Naval Base, naval oil stores and commercial dock facilities. Saigon was assigned as XXBomber Command's third priority and fourth priority was given to oil storage dumps on islands near <b>Singapore.</b>|$|E

5|$|As English courts do {{not form}} part of Singapore's {{hierarchy}} of courts, decisions of such courts are not binding on <b>Singapore</b> courts.

Judicial precedents from other jurisdictions may also be persuasive in specific areas of <b>Singapore</b> law.
