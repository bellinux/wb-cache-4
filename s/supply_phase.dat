40|$|There {{are many}} applications, such as paper mills, {{locomotive}} traction and machine tools, which require high performance control {{of more than}} one electric motor. These multi-motor drives are generally available in two configurations. The first one consists of a number of three-phase voltage source inverters (VSI) connected in parallel to a common DC link, each inverter feeding a three-phase AC motor. This configuration allows independent control of all machines by means of their own three-phase VSIs. The second method comprises one inverter, which feeds multiple parallel-connected three-phase motors. However, this configuration does not allow independent control of each motor and is suitable only for traction. This thesis explores a novel concept for multi-motor drive systems, based on utilization of multi-phase machines and VSIs, and series connection of all the machines in the group. Application of a single multi-phase VSI in conjunction with multi-phase machines generates additional degrees of freedom. The research presented here utilises these additional degrees of freedom to control a number of machines independently within a novel multi-phase multi-machine drive. The concept is {{based on the fact that}} independent flux and torque control of any AC machine, regardless of the number of stator phases requires control of only two stator current components. This leaves the remaining current components free to control other machines within the group. It is shown that it is possible to connect the machines in such a way that what one machine sees as the flux/torque producing components the other machines see as non-flux/torque producing components, and vice versa. Therefore it is possible to connect in series a number of multi-phase machines and independently control each machine while supplying them from a single multi-phase inverter. Different configurations of the multi-motor drive are possible depending on certain properties of the <b>supply</b> <b>phase</b> number. In general, higher the <b>supply</b> <b>phase</b> number is, higher the number of connectable machines is. However, some phase numbers are more favourable than others, as discussed in detail in the thesis. Simulation studies are provided for five, six, seven, nine, ten and fifteen phase configurations in order to verify the concept. It is shown that the concept is independent of the type of AC machines used and the only requirement is that they all have sinusoidal distributed magnetomotive force. Current control in both the stationary and rotating reference frames is considered and it is concluded that current control in the rotating reference frame requires compensation of the additional voltage drops caused by the series connection. Two possible methods of compensating for these voltage drops are suggested and verified by simulation. Finally, a laboratory rig is described, which utilises two three-phase inverters connected in such a way as to form a single six-phase inverter. A six-phase two-motor drive comprising a symmetrical six-phase induction machine and a three-phase induction machine or a three-phaseP MSM is investigatede xperimentally. An analysis of the performance of the two-motor drive is presented and it is shown that decoupled control of each machine is achieved...|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Wireless {{communication}} systems {{are required for}} many applications. There are different standards for these systems. IEEE 802. 15. 4 defines the communication system standard for zigbee. This study discussed designing one of the blocks of zigbee transceiver which is the Phase Locked Loop (PLL). A major target for any {{communication systems}} is saving battery power, especially for zigbee as {{it is meant to}} be a low cost communication system. Phase Locked Loop is responsible on carrier frequency selection in a communication system. It is the most power consumer block in the transceiver as well. The objective of this study was designing a low power fully integrated integer-N PLL frequency synthesizer targeting the 2. 4 GHz band IEEE 802. 15. 4 Std zigbee. Approach: Minimizing total power consumption of PLL was achieved by introducing a novel design of Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) and modifying the rest of the PLL blocks. The proposed PFD uses only 12 transistors and it preserved the main characteristics of the conventional PFD with a simple architecture. The Charge Pump (CP) was single-ended source switch to save power and minimize mismatches. The Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) spans from 4. 737 - 4. 977 GHz band using LC resonator. The VCO worked at double the frequency band to avoid local oscillator leakage and feed through. The integer N divider used a 15 / 16 dual modulus.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Changes in {{sediment}} {{supply and}} caliber during the last, 130 ka {{have resulted in}} a complex architectural evolution of the Y channel system on the western Niger Delta slope. This evolution consists of four phases, each with documented or inferred changes in sediment <b>supply.</b> <b>Phase</b> 1 flows created wide (1, 000 m), low-sinuosity (1. 1) channel forms with lateral migration and little to no aggradation. During Phase 2, the Y channel system began to aggrade, creating more narrow (300 m) and sinuous (1. 4) channel forms with many meander cutoffs. This system was abandoned at, 130 ka, perhaps related to rapid relative sea-level rise during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5. Phase 3 flows were mud-rich and deposited sediment on the outer bends of the channel form, resulting in the narrowing (to 250 m), straightening (to a sinuosity of 1. 22), and aggradation of the Y channel system. Renewed influx of sand into the Y channel system occurred with Phase 4 at, 50 ka, during MIS 3 sea-level fall. The onset of Phase 4 is marked by the initiation of the Y 9 tributary channel, which re-established sand deposition in the Y channel system. Flows entering the Y channel from the Y 9 channel were underfit, resulting in inner levee deposition that is most prevalent on outer banks, acting to further straighten (1. 21) and narrow (to 200 m wide) the Y channel. The inner levees accumulated quickly as the flows sought equilibrium, with deposition rates. 200 cm/ky. Marked by the presence of the last sand bed, abandonment occurred at, 19 ka in the Y channel and, 15 ka in the Y 9 channel and is likely related to progressive abandonment due to shelf-edge delta avulsion and/or progressive sea level rise associated with Melt Water Pulse 1 -A.

40|$|Purpose ‐ In {{the last}} decade, the Italian natural gas market has {{undergone}} profound changes. The slow ongoing process of liberalization {{that began in}} 2000 has produced many changes in the industry as companies have had {{to react to the}} new regulatory framework. Many companies have sought agreements, alliances and mergers to consolidate their position in the market, other companies have sought to diversify their product range by becoming multi-utility companies, others, unable to react to the new competitive pressures, have gone bankrupt. The aim of the work is to analyse the performance of natural gas retail companies after the liberalization of the sector. Design/methodology/approach ‐ The authors carry out a financial statement analysis for indexes in order to evaluate business management in terms of the financial, profitability and liquidity aspects. The authors analysed a sample of 111 companies operating in Italy for a six-year period (2004 - 2009) following the full liberalization of the sector (January 1, 2003). Findings ‐ Results show that many of the firms in the sample are suffering from a reduction in profits and present serious financial weaknesses. In particular, the companies that perform the worst are the small, new entrants and those in the south of Italy. In regard to the new entrants {{it should be noted that}} although more than ten years have passed since the beginning of the liberalization process, entry barriers are still present. As regards the business diversification, the best financial and operating results are achieved by large firms, listed companies and those which grew mainly through M&As. Research limitations/implications ‐ Even though there are numerous theoretical and empirical studies on the effects of diversification strategies and M&As, very few researchers have analyzed these effects in the context of a liberalization process of an energy sector. Starting from this gap in the literature, the work aims to analyse the strategies implemented by the Italian companies in the natural gas retail segment. Practical implications ‐ The empirical findings will help the policy makers of Italy in understanding that more than ten years since the beginning of the natural gas market liberalization, entry barriers are still present. Although all consumers have been free to choose their supplier since 2003, the incumbent firms have maintained a dominant position in the market, thanks to a "weak" unbundling (often the incumbent retail operator belongs to the same group as the distribution network operator) and to the advantage in the <b>supply</b> <b>phase</b> by means of a long-term contract with a "take or pay" clause. Originality/value ‐ Italy has always been characterized by the centrality of natural gas in its energy basket and it is the third European country for annual consumption.

Ten physically active (VO 2 max 3. 9 [0. 49] l·min- 1), healthy men (mean age [SD]: 25. 3 [4. 6] yrs.), participated in the study. All participants performed two maximal cycle ergometric exercise tests under normoxic as well as hypoxic conditions (FiO 2 = 14 %). Blood lactate concentration, heart rate, gas exchange data, and power output at maximum and the first and the second lactate turn point (LTP 1, LTP 2), the heart rate turn point (HRTP) and the first and the second ventilatory turn point (VETP 1, VETP 2) were determined. Since in normobaric hypoxia absolute power output (P) was reduced at all reference points (max: 314 / 274 W; LTP 2 : 218 / 184 W; LTP 1 : 110 / 96 W), as well as VO 2 max (max: 3. 90 / 3. 23 l·min- 1; LTP 2 : 2. 90 / 2. 43 l·min- 1; LTP 1 : 1. 66 / 1. 52 l·min- 1), percentages of Pmax at LTP 1, LTP 2, HRTP and VETP 1, VETP 2 were almost identical for hypoxic as well as normoxic conditions. Heart rate was significantly reduced at Pmax in hypoxia (max: 190 / 185 bpm), but no significant differences were found at submaximal control points. Blood lactate concentration was not different at maximum, and all reference points in both conditions. Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (max: 1. 28 / 1. 08; LTP 2 : 1. 13 / 0. 98) and ventilatory equivalents for O 2 (max: 43. 4 / 34. 0; LTP 2 : 32. 1 / 25. 4) and CO 2 (max: 34. 1 / 31. 6; LTP 2 : 29. 1 / 26. 1) were significantly higher at some reference points in hypoxia. Significant correlations were found between LTP 1 and VETP 1 (r = 0. 778; p < 0. 01), LTP 2 and HRTP (r = 0. 828; p < 0. 01) and VETP 2 (r = 0. 948; p < 0. 01) for power output for both conditions. We conclude that the lactate turn point determination according to the three-phase-model of energy supply is valid in normobaric, normoxic as well as hypoxic conditions. The turn points for La, HR, and VE were reproducible among both conditions, but shifted left to lower workloads. The lactate turn point determination may therefore be used for the prescription of exercise performance in both environments...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the supply of markers for the identification of syringes distributed by pharmacy needle exchanges and to determine if this product and service delivery offers a feasible method of marking syringes to promote the reduction of accidental sharing of syringes and needles amongst injecting drug users (IDU) and thereby reduce the risk of transmission of blood borne viruses (BBVs) and other related infections. This study involves the assessment, implementation and evaluation of syringe markers as a pilot study within three community pharmacy sites in Glasgow. The secondary aims of the study were to identify whether the supply of syringe markers from community pharmacy needle exchanges was acceptable to IDU and if it enabled them to mark their syringes. The literature review demonstrates that providing a means of identification of personal injecting equipment has been proposed as a viable option that should be promoted to prevent the inadvertent accidental sharing of syringes within a group setting. Needle exchanges (NEX) are important component parts of the harm reduction responses designed to reduce the physical health harms caused to individuals through injecting drug use. The literature is reviewed on BBV transmission and the historical, legal and policy context associated with the development of NEXs. Community pharmacies act as a source of health advice and can help to facilitate access to treatment services for those attending the NEX. However the specific {{aim of this}} study is not to investigate the totality of the benefits of a NEX but to examine the supply of a potential means of reducing accidental and unintentional sharing of all injecting equipment and thereby contribute to minimising some of the health harms linked to injecting drug use. Three established community pharmacies were identified as suitable sites to pilot the supply of syringe markers. A number of criteria were used to select the sites. These included an assessment of the geographic locations, staffing arrangements, NEX attendances and transactional activity and the availability of private consultation facilities. The health board central database which holds records on a range of factors including, the characteristics of those who attend NEX and detailed information on all transactions, was used to identify the most suitable sites to pilot the new intervention. This indicated that the characteristics of those who attended the three chosen sites were broadly similar to the wider NEX attending population. The evaluation was conducted in two separate periods. The first 4 week period was the <b>supply</b> <b>phase</b> where markers were distributed over this period to all patients receiving NEX packs from the 3 pharmacies. The second data collection phase was undertaken in the following 4 week period. Data was collected by means of a structured questionnaire. In order to reduce the potential interviewer bias it was decided to incorporate the use of peer researchers in the administration of the questionnaire. The Scottish Drugs Forum (SDF) was approached and agreement was reached to use members of the Service User Involvement Group (SUIG) to assist with the design and administration of the questionnaire.

Aside from literature review, semi-structured interview were conducted to two project’s team in order to gain insight review on the initiatives implemented by each of the party during the construction <b>supply</b> chain <b>phase.</b> The study suggests that the level of adoption of GSCM in the Malaysian construction industry was still at the development phase. The initiatives of GSCM implemented was not as a whole and restricted to several <b>supply</b> chain <b>phase</b> only mainly green design, green purchasing and green construction. It is hoped that, the study information will be useful in promoting GSCM amongst the Malaysian construction industry players...|$|R
40|$|Balanced {{operation}} of three phase synchronous motors have {{been dealt with}} extensively in the literature. However, unbalanced operation has not received as much attention. One of the interesting unbalanced modes of these motors is their operation from a single <b>phase</b> <b>supply.</b> Such a mode of operation can be of special importance in remote areas where only single <b>phase</b> <b>supply</b> is available {{or in the case}} of an open circuited single line fault. In this paper, the possibility of operating three phase synchronous motors from a single <b>phase</b> <b>supply</b> through the use of a phase balancer capacitor is explored. The criteria for selecting the required phase balancer capacitor is presented, and the analysis of the behaviour of such motors during the starting process is carried out. For this purpose, a rigorous state space mathematical model has been developed. The validity of this model have been verified experimentally. IEE...|$|R
40|$|A {{scheme for}} fast {{starting}} of three phase induction motors is proposed. This scheme {{is based on}} starting the motor from a single <b>phase</b> <b>supply</b> {{with the help of}} a phase balancer properly selected for achieving maximum starting torque. As the speed reaches a predetermined value, a simple centrifugal switch is used to reconnect the motor to the three <b>phase</b> <b>supply.</b> The feasibility of the proposed scheme is proven through the development of a rigorous state space mathematical model and its associated digital simulation, followed by experimental verification...|$|R
