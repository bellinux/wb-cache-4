5|$|France even {{linked the}} issue of the seat to the ongoing dispute {{regarding}} the seat of the European Parliament. Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg has a banking tradition that wasn't <b>so</b> <b>careful.</b> London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone. It was also seen as important to locate the bank in a city not already hosting a national government or EU institution, in order to emphasise its independence. Others, such as {{the former head of the}} Bundesbank Karl Otto Pöhl, favoured a small country with a stable currency. The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists. While there was seen by some as little to gain in terms of attracting other banks and financial institutions, others saw it as affecting which cities would be financial hubs in the years to come.|$|E
25|$|Consumers {{who keep}} their account in good order by always staying within their credit limit, and always making {{at least the}} minimum monthly payment will see {{interest}} as the biggest expense from their card provider. Those who are not <b>so</b> <b>careful</b> and regularly surpass their credit limit or are late in making payments are exposed to multiple charges that were typically as high as £25–35 until a ruling from the Office of Fair Trading that they would presume charges over £12 to be unfair which led the majority of card providers to reduce their fees to £12.|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} {{degree of}} treatment for the collected dried feces depends entirely on whether this product will be reused in agriculture. If it is not reused, but only buried, then no further treatment is required. The dried feces are in almost all cases not entirely sanitized when removed from a vault of the UDDT, <b>so</b> <b>careful</b> handling is obligatory. In scenarios wherein excreta is to be reused in agriculture, a secondary treatment of fecal matter and storage of urine is advisable to ensure adequate sanitization. Fecal material from single vault UDDTs must always be post-treated, even if just via prolonged storage. Fecal material from double vaults has typically passed a certain storage time and is therefore already more sanitized. However, a secondary form of treatment is optional but recommended for household systems and required for large-scale systems.|$|E

25|$|All {{the work}} {{related to the}} Parallel Postulate {{revealed}} that it was quite difficult for a geometer to separate his logical reasoning from his intuitive understanding of physical space, and, moreover, revealed the critical importance of doing <b>so.</b> <b>Careful</b> examination had uncovered some logical inadequacies in Euclid's reasoning, and some unstated geometric principles to which Euclid sometimes appealed. This critique paralleled the crisis occurring in calculus and analysis regarding the meaning of infinite processes such as convergence and continuity. In geometry, {{there was a clear}} need for a new set of axioms, which would be complete, and which in no way relied on pictures we draw or on our intuition of space. Such axioms, now known as Hilbert's axioms, were given by David Hilbert in 1894 in his dissertation Grundlagen der Geometrie (Foundations of Geometry). Some other complete sets of axioms had been given a few years earlier, but did not match Hilbert's in economy, elegance, and similarity to Euclid's axioms.|$|E
25|$|After his {{personal}} tragedies while he remaining locked in his room, Blackford {{began working on}} a book to report the important decisions of the Supreme Court and provide a legal source to the state lawyers and judges. He was meticulous and precise in his writing. His biographer attributed his ability to write concisely {{to the fact that he}} never practiced law extensively, and never developed the habit of writing lengthy arguments, but instead kept his thoughts clear and precise. Each volume he authored covered a decade of court decisions and were published four years after the decade was complete. <b>So</b> <b>careful</b> was Blackford in ensuring the quality and accuracy of the work, he regularly held up printing to make corrections found after a few volumes were printed, and after they were printed, if an error was reported, he would destroy the existing copies and have new ones made. He used his own savings to have the books published with the intention of selling them to lawyers in Indiana. The sale of the books brought Blackford a substantial income, and he earned between $1,500 and $2,000 annually on royalties.|$|E

500|$|Weezer {{turned down}} a video {{treatment}} for lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] proposed by Spike Jonze, who had previously helped raise the band's status with his videos for [...] "Undone – The Sweater Song" [...] and [...] "Buddy Holly". Cuomo explained: [...] "I really don't want the songs to come across untainted this time around... I really want to communicate my feelings directly and because I was <b>so</b> <b>careful</b> in writing that way. I'd hate for the video to kinda misrepresent the song, or exaggerate certain aspects." [...] The final video featured the band playing in an assembly hall in Los Angeles, surrounded by light fixtures flashing {{in time to the}} music. Mark Romanek, the video's director, quit after numerous arguments with Cuomo, leaving Cuomo to edit the video himself. The video debuted on MTV's 120 Minutes and received moderate airplay.|$|E
500|$|It was {{followed}} that {{year by the}} neo-noir crime thriller Mulholland Falls, which featured the murder of Allison Pond (Connelly), mistress of General Timms (John Malkovich), and the investigation {{by a group of}} detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nick Nolte). New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond: [...] "This footage is actually dirty. That is, it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it, but it's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away". About nudity in the movie, Connelly said: [...] "It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie, because I had always been <b>so</b> <b>careful</b> about nudity, it was {{very much a part of}} this character and I couldn't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn't work. It was sort of a challenge I wanted to take on, I guess".|$|E
500|$|The studio {{originally}} dismissed The Lion King as a risk because, at the time, it {{was believed}} that the greatest films starred people. Concerned about the novelty of the film, Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg decided to divide the studio into two separate animated films, The Lion King and Pocahontas, the latter of which was dubbed [...] "the home run" [...] because it was expected to be the more successful of the two projects. Naturally, Disney's more seasoned and experienced animators gravitated towards Pocahontas, while the studio's newer animators were relegated to working on The Lion King, dubbing themselves the [...] "B-team". However, Allers received Katzenberg's decision positively as an opportunity for [...] "newer animators ... to step up to leadership roles", among them Andreas Deja, who became Scar's supervising animator. Well known for animating several Disney villains, Deja summarized the experience as [...] "more fun than drawing heroes" [...] because [...] "You have so much more to work with in terms of expressions and acting and drawing-wise than you would have with a nice princess or a prince ... where you have to be ever <b>so</b> <b>careful</b> with the draftsmanship".|$|E

[...] Nathaniel Rogers of The Film Experience gave the film a negative review and wrote: [...] "Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone is as bland as movies can get." [...] Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine wished that the film had been directed by Tim Burton, finding the cinematography [...] "bland and muggy," [...] and the majority of the film a [...] "solidly dull celebration of dribbling goo." [...] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times was highly negative about the film, saying [...] " [...] is like a theme park that's a few years past its prime; the rides clatter and groan with metal fatigue every time they take a curve." [...] He also said it suffered from [...] "a lack of imagination" [...] and wooden characters, adding, [...] "The Sorting Hat has more personality than anything else in the movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{keep the}} {{matrices}} circulating smoothly throughout the machine, {{it is necessary}} that oil not be allowed anywhere near the matrix path. If oil is found in the matrix's path (due to careless maintenance or over-lubrication of nearby parts), it combines with dust, forming a gummy substance that is eventually deposited in the magazine by the matrices. The most common result is that the matrix will not be released from the magazine at its usual speed, and almost always results in a letter or two arriving out of sequence in the assembler — a [...] "matrix transposition". When these machines were in heavy use, it was not uncommon for an operator to set type at the rate of over 4,000ems per hour, with the fastest operators being able to exceed 10,000ems per hour (approximately 10 to 30 Words Per Minute in today's units) <b>so</b> <b>careful</b> lubrication and regular cleaning were essential to keep these machines operating at their full potential.|$|E
2500|$|After {{their return}} to New York City from a brief visit to Mar del Plata in 1930, {{the family moved to}} Little Italy in lower Manhattan. In 1932 Piazzolla {{composed}} his first tango, [...] "La Catinga". The following year he took music lessons with the Hungarian classical pianist Bela Wilda, a student of Rachmaninoff who taught him to play Bach on his bandoneon. In 1934 he met Carlos Gardel, {{one of the most important}} figures in the history of tango, and played a cameo role as a paper boy in his movie El día que me quieras. Gardel invited the young bandoneon player to join him on his [...] tour. Much to Piazzolla's dismay, his father decided that he was not old enough to go along. The disappointment of being forbidden to join the tour proved to be fortunate, as it was on this tour in 1935 that Gardel and his entire orchestra perished in a plane crash. In later years, Piazzolla made light of this near miss, joking that if his father had not been <b>so</b> <b>careful,</b> Piazzolla would be playing the harp rather than the bandoneon.|$|E
