It is capped by a blue mosaic dome beneath which 3,000 Muslims may offer prayer. The Abu Darweesh Mosque, noted for its checkered black-and-white pattern, has an architectural style that is unique to Jordan. The mosque is situated on Jabal Ashrafieh, the highest point in the city. The mosque's interior is marked by light-coloured walls and Persian carpets. It was built by a Circassian resident of Amman. During the 2004 Amman Message conference, edicts from various clergy-members afforded the following schools of thought as garnering collective recognition: Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi'i, Ja'fari, Zahiri, Zaydi, Ibadi, tassawuf-related Sufism, Muwahhidism and <b>Salafism.</b> Amman also has a small Druze community.|$|E

25|$|Non-sectarian Muslims who {{reject the}} {{authority}} of hadith, known as Quranists, Quraniyoon, or Ahl al-Quran, are also present in Egypt. During the early 20th century, the ideas of Egyptian Quranists like Muhammad Tawfiq Sidqi (1881–1920) {{are thought to have}} grown out of <b>Salafism</b> – specifically a rejection of taqlid. Notable Egyptian Quranists include Sidqi, Rashad Khalifa, Ahmed Subhy Mansour, and Tawfik Hamid.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} trend of Islamic fundamentalism, <b>Salafism,</b> {{is based upon}} a literal reading of the Qur'an and Sunnah without relying on the interpretations of Islamic jurists or Imams, rejecting the need for Taqlid. Fundamentalist Protestantism is similar, in that the 'traditions of men' and the Church Fathers are {{rejected}} {{in favor of a}} literalist interpretation of the Bible, which is seen as inerrant. Islamic Fundamentalists and Protestant Fundamentalists often reject contextual interpretation.|$|E
25|$|It was {{the first}} of several Islamic {{movements}} – including secularism, Islamism and <b>Salafism</b> – that emerged {{in the middle of the}} 19th century in reaction to the rapid changes of the time, especially the perceived onslaught of Western Civilization and colonialism on the Muslim world. Founders include Muhammad Abduh, a Sheikh of Al-Azhar University for a brief period before his death in 1905, Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani, and Muhammad Rashid Rida (d. 1935).|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} variation {{as to how}} the above sources are interpreted by Orthodox Muslims, both Sunni and Shi'aapproximately 90% of the world's Muslim populationand ideological fundamentalists, most notably those subscribing to Wahhabism or <b>Salafism,</b> who comprise roughly 9% of the total. In particular, Wahhabis and Salafists tend to reject mysticism and theology outright; this has profound implications for the way that women are perceived within these ideological sects. Conversely, within Islamic Orthodoxy, both the established theological schools and Sufism are at least somewhat influential.|$|E
25|$|Often {{viewed as}} a {{minority}} figure in his own times and in the centuries that followed, Ibn Taymiyyah {{has become one of}} the most influential medieval writers in contemporary Islam, where his particular interpretations of the Qur'an and the Sunnah and his rejection of some aspects of classical Islamic tradition are believed to have had considerable influence on contemporary Wahhabism, <b>Salafism,</b> and Jihadism. Indeed, particular aspects of his teachings had a profound influence on Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the founder of the Hanbali reform movement practiced in Saudi Arabia known as Wahhabism, and on other later Wahabi scholars. Moreover, Ibn Taymiyyah's controversial fatwa allowing jihad against other Muslims is referenced to by Al-Qaeda and other jihadi groups.|$|E
25|$|However, since 2001 {{the civil}} society in the three {{southern}} Thai provinces has experienced a widespread imposition of legalistic Salafi norms and the reality {{on the ground is}} today very different from what it was in former southern Thailand. <b>Salafism</b> has heavily eroded Patani cultural identity and current insurgent groups have extreme religious goals, such as an Islamic Caliphate, to the detriment of Patani nationalism. Although some of the present-day insurgents are very likely former PULO members, it is still unclear whether they fight for PULO's cause and it is likely that many may have become part of the more active and religious organisations that have overtaken PULO. In recent years PULO's leadership has largely lost control over its insurgents and has a very limited overall degree of influence over the insurgency in southern Thailand.|$|E
25|$|The post-revolution Tunisia has {{witnessed}} an unprecedented rise in radical Islamism, known as <b>Salafism,</b> with increasing militant activity, weapons smuggling from Libya {{and involvement in}} the political scene. They range from self-claimed moderate parties like Ennahda to the more hard-line Ansar al-Sharia and Hizb ut-Tahrir. Most of them denounced violence {{as a way to}} reach their goals and have advocated democracy. However, some have been engaged in numerous clashes with security forces mainly in the south and north-west of the country resulting in numerous casualties on both sides in a conflict that is often related to the wider Maghreb insurgency. Several attacks by jihadist factions took place in the Mount Chaambi national park on the border with Algeria. On 29 July 2013, a military convoy was ambushed by militants resulting in a number of deaths with many of the victims found beheaded and others mutilated. A week later, the Tunisian Armed Forces responded with an army offensive and air strikes to clear out the mountains of Islamist elements responsible for the assaults.|$|E

2500|$|Sufism {{continued}} {{to remain a}} crucial part of daily Islamic life until the twentieth century, when its historical influence upon Islamic civilization began to be undermined by modernism as well as be combated by the rise of <b>Salafism</b> and Wahhabism. Islamic scholar Timothy Winter has remarked: [...] " [...] classical, mainstream, medieval Sunni Islam ... 'orthodox Islam' would not ... without Sufism," [...] and that the classical belief in Sufism being an essential component of Islam has only weakened in some quarters of the Islamic world [...] "a generation or two ago" [...] with the rise of <b>Salafism.</b> In the modern world, the classical interpretation of Sunni orthodoxy, which sees in Sufism an essential dimension of Islam alongside the disciplines of jurisprudence and theology, is represented by institutions such as Egypt's Al-Azhar University and Zaytuna College, with Al-Azhar's current Grand Imam Ahmed el-Tayeb recently defining [...] "Sunni orthodoxy" [...] as being a follower [...] "of any of the four schools of [...] thought (Hanafi, Shafi’i, Maliki or Hanbali) and ... of the Sufism of Imam Junayd of Baghdad in doctrines, manners and [...] purification." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alongside notable Islamists like Maulana Mawdudi, Hasan al-Banna, and Ruhollah Khomeini, Qutb is {{considered}} one of the most influential Muslim thinkers or activists of the modern era, not only for his ideas but also for what many see as his martyr's death. According to authors Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, [...] "it was Sayyid Qutb who fused together the core elements of modern Islamism: the Kharijites' takfir, ibn Taymiyya's fatwas and policy prescriptions, Rashid Rida's <b>salafism,</b> Maududi's concept of the contemporary jahiliyya and Hassan al-Banna's political activism." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2004 {{according}} to Saudi Arabia's newspaper [...] "The Arab News" [...] based in New York and Jeddah, over 2,500 Muslim intellectuals from 23 countries signed a petition {{addressed to the}} United Nations to raise awareness {{on the use of}} religion for incitement to violence. Al-Qaradawi was mentioned among “the sheikhs of death,” as the signatories defined those who manipulate religion to incite violence, for “providing a religious cover for terrorism.” A charge al-Qaradawi dismissed as baseless and slanderous.

2500|$|Virtually all Saudi {{citizens}} are Muslim (officially, all are), {{and almost all}} Saudi residents are Muslim. Estimates of the Sunni population of Saudi Arabia range between 75% and 90%, with the remaining 10–25% being Shia Muslim. The official and dominant form of Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia {{is commonly known as}} Wahhabism (proponents prefer the name <b>Salafism,</b> considering Wahhabi derogatory) and is often described as 'puritanical', 'intolerant', or 'ultra-conservative' by observers, and as [...] "true" [...] Islam by its adherents. It was founded in the Arabian Peninsula by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab in the eighteenth century. Other denominations, such as the minority Shia Islam, are systematically suppressed.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{difference}} between Shia fundamentalism in Iran and mainstream Islamic fundamentalism is that the former {{has nothing to do}} with <b>Salafism.</b> According to Gary Legenhausen: [...] "The term Islamic Fundamentalism is one that has been invented by Western journalists by analogy with Christian Fundamentalism. It is not a very apt term, but it has gained currency. In the Sunni world it is used for groups descended from the Salafiyyah movement, such as the Muslim Brotherhood." [...] It is worth noting that the concept of [...] "Salaf" [...] (السلف) does not exist in Shia theology in contrast to Sunni Islam as well as Christianity (a similar concept referred to as [...] "original Christianity").|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, the niqab {{became the}} centre of debate at Cairo University. In March 1987, 5000 {{students}} demonstrated {{for three days and}} abused the dean of the Faculty of Medicine for barring a face-veiled student from campus. The mufti of Egypt ruled that the campus ban on the niqab did not contravene the Sharia, but in March 1988 the Council of State's Administrative Court overturned the ban. The niqāb, commonly associated as a sign of <b>Salafism</b> and Muslim Brotherhood sympathies, still remains {{the centre of}} debates on the Islamisation of society.

2500|$|One {{ideology}} that {{plays a role}} in terrorism by using the name of Islam, is Wahabism. Wahabism and its allies including <b>Salafism</b> (Salafi jihadism) supports war against any one and every one who is not like them. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, al-Qaeda, Al-Shabaab (militant group), Boko Haram, Indonesian Mujahedeen Council, Taliban, Sipah Sahaba, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Hizbul Mujahideen follow intolerant Wahabi or Salafi ideology which is opposed by other Muslims. Non-Muslims, Sufis, and Shias are attacked by hard-core Wahhabis, Deobandis, and jamaatis {{in the same way that}} socialists and other leftist proletarians were assaulted by Mussolini's bandits, Jews and others by the Nazis, and [...] "bourgeois", [...] "kulak", intellectual, Jewish, [...] "Menshevik", and [...] "Trotskyist" [...] dissenters were assaulted by Stalinists. In India, Wahabism was spread in the name of Deobandi movement, which was opposed by more tolerant Sufi oriented Indian Muslims.|$|E
2500|$|Whether Salafis/Wahhabis are a {{majority}} in Saudi Arabia is disputed, with one estimate putting their number at only 22.9% of the native population (concentrated in Najd). The Wahhabi mission has been dominant in Najd for two hundred years, but in most {{other parts of the}} country—Hejaz, the Eastern Province, Najran—it has dominated only since 1913-1925. Most of the 15 to 20 million Saudi citizens are Sunni Muslims, while the eastern regions are populated mostly by Twelver Shia, and there are Zaydi Shia in the southern regions. [...] According to a number of sources, only a minority of Saudis consider themselves Wahhabis, although according to other sources, the Wahhabi affiliation is up to 40%, making it a very dominant minority, at the very least using a native population of 17 million based on [...] "2008-9 estimates". In addition, the next largest affiliation is with <b>Salafism,</b> which encompasses all of the central principles of Wahhabism, with a number of minor additional accepted principles differentiating the two.|$|E
2500|$|The Nahda period {{sought to}} {{modernize}} Islam and society. Thinkers and religious reformers rejected traditional views and encourage modernization through {{the abandonment of}} taqlid (imitation, conformity to legal precedent) and emphasis on ijtihad (intellectual effort, reasoning and hermeneutics), which they saw as a return to Islamic origins. The Islamic Modernist movement, also {{sometimes referred to as}} Modernist <b>Salafism,</b> has been described as [...] "the first Muslim ideological response to the Western cultural challenge" [...] Islamic modernism was the first of several movements – including secularism, Islamism and <b>Salafism</b> – that emerged {{in the middle of the}} 19th century in reaction to the rapid changes of the time, especially the perceived onslaught of Western Civilization and colonialism on the Muslim world. The founders of Islamic modernism include Muhammad Abduh, a Sheikh of Al-Azhar University for a brief period before his death in 1905, Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani, and Muhammad Rashid Rida (d. 1935). The movement started with Rifa'a al-Tahtawi but gained popularity when al-Afghani organized a group of Muslim scholars to discuss the socio-political and theological challenges that Islam was facing. The movement attempted to reconcile Islamic faith with modern Western values such as nationalism, democracy, civil rights, rationality, equality, and progress. It featured a [...] "critical reexamination of the classical conceptions and methods of jurisprudence" [...] and a new approach to Islamic theology and Quranic exegesis (Tafsir). Islamic modernism and liberal nationalism were interconnected, both were factors in the retreat of Islamic orthodoxy and the decline of the absolutist state. Although Middle Eastern liberal nationalism took Western liberalism as inspiration, favoring national integration via cultural and educational reforms, the promotion of indigenous national languages, and the separation of religion and politics, concepts of nationalism, and the principles of democratic institutions. It was a response to colonialism and interventionism and collided with Western interests in the region. In Egypt, Islamic modernism let liberal nationals reach a wider audience. This ended in the 1920s and 1930s when liberal nationalism took a strong secularist orientation, weakening Islamic modernism. All these changes in the Muslim world created a sense of crisis within Islam that favored Islamic revivalism.|$|E
2500|$|The {{predominant}} {{religion in}} Benghazi is Islam. Practically {{all of the}} city's inhabitants are Sunni Muslims. During Islamic holidays such as Ramadan, most abstain from food; restaurants are usually empty during the day, {{with the exception of}} some expatriates and tourists. Alcohol is banned by law in Benghazi and throughout Libya in accordance with Islamic principles. The conservative Islamic nature of Benghazi creates a strong sense of family life in the city – [...] practically all teenagers and young adults live at home until they get married. Many Muslims in Benghazi adhere to the traditional Maliki school of religious law, however much less so than in decades past. In recent years, more people are beginning to practice <b>Salafism</b> with the spread of literalist inclined Islamic television channels. It is not uncommon therefore to see woman wearing black niqabs and men with full beards in Benghazi because of the existence of such schools, although not exclusively for that purpose. The Senussi order from which the royal dynasty sprang has traditionally enjoyed strong support in Benghazi and the Cyrenaica.|$|E
2500|$|Of humble origin, Ibn al-Qayyim's {{father was}} the {{principal}} (qayyim) of the School of Jawziyya, which {{also served as a}} court of law for the Hanbali judge of Damascus during the time period. Ibn al-Qayyim {{went on to become a}} prolific scholar, producing a rich corpus of [...] "doctrinal and literary" [...] works. As a result, numerous important Muslim scholars of the Mamluk period were among Ibn al-Qayyim's students or, at least, greatly influenced by him, including, amongst others, the Shafi historian Ibn Kathir (d. 774/1373), the Hanbali hadith scholar Ibn Rajab (d. 795/1397), and the Shafi polymath Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d. 852/1449). In the present day, Ibn al-Qayyim's name has become a controversial one in certain quarters of the Islamic world due to his popularity amongst many adherents of the Sunni reform movements of <b>Salafism</b> and Wahhabism, who see in his criticisms of such widespread orthodox Sunni practices of the medieval period as the veneration of saints and the veneration of their graves and relics a classical precursor to their own perspective.|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens, though {{preferring to}} speak of [...] "fascism with an Islamic face", a {{variation}} on the phrase [...] "Islam with a fascist face" [...] deployed by Fred Halliday to describe developments in Iran after the overthrow of the Shah in 1979, insisted that Bin Ladenism and <b>Salafism</b> shared similarities with clerical fascism, a term already used by Walter Laqueur to refer to the recent form a resurgent Islamic fundamentalism was taking. Such clerical fascism was, he argued, like Islamic fundamentalism, had a devotion to a charismatic leader, a point contested by Frederick W. Kagan, trusted in the authoritative power of one book, was queasy about sexual deviance, contemptuous of women, hostile to modernity. nostalgic for past glories, toxicly Judeophobic, obsessed with old grievances, real and imagined, and addicted to revenge. Islamofascism was, he allowed, not perfectly congruent, with European fascism, in that the latter idealized the nation-state. Islam has no concept of a master race. On the other hand, he affirmed, the notion of a revived Caliphate might lend itself to an analogy with Hitler's Greater Germany, and Mussolini's desire to revive the Roman Empire, as Islamic rhetoric about the pure believers as opposed to the kuffār suggests a non-ethnic based form of cleansing.|$|E
2500|$|Al-Qaradawi {{has been}} a staunch critic of <b>Salafism</b> (Wahhabism). He says this group stems its roots from Saudi Arabia and is just 200-years-old since its {{establishment}} compared to Islam which have existed for over 1,400 years who've lived in peace and harmony with Christians, Jews and other faiths. He says this group was created by Saudi Arabia's founder Ibn Saud together with Salafi (Wahhabi) founder Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab whom was all from Najd (today Riyadh) {{with the help of}} British after toppling the legitimate Islamic Empire of Ottomans which was mainstream Sunni Islam at that time and that it also see the oust of Hussein bin Ali (Sharif of Mecca) who're the original Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in charge of Makkah's Al-Masjid al-Haram and Madinah's Al-Masjid an-Nabawi for over a thousand years since the time of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad whom is also the Prophet's direct descendant; the Hashemites, which now resides and rule over Jordan which have no natural resources and regarded as the poorest Arab countries in the Middle East. Qaradawi warns the world that it's Salafist (Wahhabist) that has caused terrorism all over the world especially groups like Islamic State, Boko Haram, Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Al-Shabaab, Abu Sayyaf and other similar groups alike. He also said that Israel and America heavily exploits from these groups by funding them since the 1970s until the present-day to pursue their (Western) political agenda in controlling the vast wealth of oil, gas, coal and mine to further destabilized the natural-resource-rich Middle East and beyond. Qaradawi also said that if more terrorist attacks were to occurred, Israel will greatly benefit from it as it will give boosts to the sales of Israeli security companies and firms to promote their high-tech equipment globally in both hard and software forms. Qaradawi says the deceitful evil implications of those countries' complicity with this group is irreversible and has no end in sight. He compares them (takfiri groups) to dogs from Hell-fire for using religion to kill the innocents. He further says that Ash'aris, Maturidis can overcome their tiny existence. He issued a fatwa (edict) in 2014 denouncing the Islamic State (Daesh) declaration of [...] "caliphate" [...] and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as [...] "invalid, null and void" [...] from every aspect, every angle of the Islamic Sharia Law.|$|E
