40|$|Journal articlePurpose: Monte Carlo (MC) {{simulation}} can be {{used for}} accurate electron beam treatment planning and modeling. Measurement of large electron fields, with the applicator removed and secondary collimator wide open, has been shown to provide accurate simulation parameters, including asymmetry in the measured dose, for the full range of clinical field sizes and patient positions. Recently, disassembly of the treatment head of a linear accelerator has been used to refine the simulation of the electron beam, setting tightly measured constraints on source and geometry parameters used in simulation. The simulation did not explicitly include the known deflection of the electron beam by a fringe magnetic field from the bending magnet, which extended into the treatment head. Instead, the <b>secondary</b> <b>scattering</b> foil and monitor chamber were unrealistically laterally offset to account for the beam deflection. This work is focused on accounting for this fringe magnetic field in treatment head simulation. Methods: The magnetic field below the exit window of a Siemens Oncor linear accelerator was measured with a Tesla-meter from 0 to 12 cm from the exit window and 1 - 3 cm off-axis. Treatment head simulation was performed with the EGSnrc/BEAMnrc code, modified to incorporate the effect of the magnetic field on charged particle transport. Simulations were used to analyze the sensitivity of dose profiles to various sources of asymmetry in the treatment head. This included the lateral spot offset and beam angle at the exit window, the fringe magnetic field and independent lateral offsets of the <b>secondary</b> <b>scattering</b> foil and electron monitor chamber. Simulation parameters were selected within the limits imposed by measurement uncertainties. Calculated dose distributions were then compared with those measured in water. Results: The magnetic field was a maximum at the exit window, increasing from 0. 006 T at 6 MeV to 0. 020 T at 21 MeV and dropping to approximately 5 % of the maximum at the <b>secondary</b> <b>scattering</b> foil. It was up to three times higher in the bending plane, away from the electron gun, and symmetric within measurement uncertainty in the transverse plane. Simulations showed the magnetic field resulted in an offset of the electron beam of 0. 80 cm (mean) at the machine isocenter for the exit window only configuration. The fringe field resulted in a 3. 5 %- 7. 6 % symmetry and 0. 25 - 0. 35 cm offset of the clinical beam R-max profiles. With the magnetic field included in simulations, a single (realistic) position of the <b>secondary</b> <b>scattering</b> foil and monitor chamber was selected. Measured and simulated dose profiles showed agreement to an average of 2. 5 %/ 0. 16 cm (maximum: 3 %/ 0. 2 cm), which is a better match than previously achieved without incorporating the magnetic field in the simulation. The undulations from the 3 stepped layers of the <b>secondary</b> <b>scattering</b> foil, evident in the measured profiles of the higher energy beams, are now aligned with those in the simulated beam. The simulated fringe magnetic field had negligible effect on the central axis depth dose curves and cross-plane dose profiles. Conclusions: The fringe magnetic field is a significant contributor to the electron beam in-plane asymmetry. With the magnetic field included explicitly in the simulation, realistic monitor chamber and <b>secondary</b> <b>scattering</b> foil positions have been achieved, and the calculated fluence and dose distributions are more accurate.

30|$|Maternal {{abdominal}} lead shielding {{has been}} reported to be an effective way of reducing fetal scatter radiation [22]. Circumferential lead covering yields in a double dose reduction to the fetus in comparison with anterior shielding only [65]. The contribution to the fetal dose of <b>secondary</b> internally <b>scattered</b> radiation increases with increasing lead thickness but reaches a plateau at a certain thickness of lead. The component resulting from <b>secondary</b> internally <b>scattered</b> radiation is much smaller in magnitude than the external and primary internal scatter radiation. The primary internal scatter radiation can be seen as independent of the thickness of lead used for shielding [66]. Of course, allowing the shielding to reach the direct radiation exposure field must be carefully avoided because the automatic tube current regulation would immediately cause a tremendous increase in the applied dose.|$|R

40|$|Uniquely {{fractured}} target rocks {{known as}} shatter cones {{are associated with}} more than one half the world's 120 or so presently known impact structures. Shatter cones are a form of tensile rock failure in which a positive conical plug separates from a negative outer cup or mold and delicate ornaments radiating from an apex are preserved on surfaces of both portions. Although distinct, shatter cones are sometimes confused with other striated geologic features such as ventifacts, stylolites, cone-in-cone, slickensides, and artificial blast plumes. Complete cones or solitary cones are rare, occurrences are usually as swarms in thoroughly fractured rock. Shatter cones may form in a zone where an expanding shock wave propagating through a target decays to form an elastic wave. Near this transition zone, the expanding primary wave may strike a pebble or other inhomogeneity whose contrasting transmission properties produce a <b>scattered</b> <b>secondary</b> wave. Interference between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>scattered</b> waves produce conical stress fields with axes perpendicular to the plane of an advancing shock front.

The narrow collimated beam method made corrections from multiple and small-angle scatterings of photons unnecessary. The attenuation depended on the chemical composition and densities of the wood species. The linear attenuation coefficients of wood species at 50 – 150 keV were highest for Pterygota macrocarpa (4. 53 m− 1) and lowest for Antiaris africana (1. 24 m− 1); the mass attenuation coefficient was highest for Triplochiton scleroxylon (17. 62 m 2 /kg) and lowest for Nesogordonia papaverifera (2. 27 m 2 /kg).

40|$|The {{modeling}} of large-amplitude internal waves (LAIWs) propagating in the Strait of Gibraltar {{is carried out}} using a fully nonlinear nonhydrostatic numerical model. The focus of the modeling efforts was on three-dimensional peculiarities of LAIW evolution, namely, cross-strait variability, interaction with lateral boundaries (including wave breaking and water mixing), radiation of secondary waves from orographic features, and interaction of <b>secondary</b> <b>scattered</b> internal waves. The along-channel propagation of packets of LAIWs reveals remarkable three-dimensional behavior. Due to the Coriolis force and multiple reflections from the lateral boundaries, the largest leading LAIW loses its energy much faster than that in the packet tail, which captures the scattered energy from the leading wave as it propagates and grows in amplitude. As {{a result of the}} energy transfer, the initially rank-ordered wave packet loses its regular structure to evolve into a non-rank-ordered wave train.
