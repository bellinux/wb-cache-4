2500|$|Richard Taylor, a CMS missionary from Whanganui, {{attempted}} {{to persuade the}} Ngāti Tama and Ngāti Rangatahi to leave the disputed land. Eventually Grey paid compensation for the potato crop they had planted on the land. He also gave them 300acres at Kaiwharawhara by the modern ferry terminal. Chief Taringakuri agreed to these terms. But when the settlers tried to move onto the land they were frightened off. On 27 February the British and their Te Ati Awa allies burnt the Māori Pa at Maraenuku in the Hutt Valley, which had been built on land that the settlers claimed to own. [...] The Ngati Rangatahi retaliated on 1 and 3 March by raiding settlers’ farms, destroying furniture, smashing windows, killing pigs, and threatening the settlers with death if they gave the alarm.

The "No Passing Zone" sign was formulated and approved by the <b>Governor's</b> <b>Safety</b> Committee a short time prior to the experimental erection of the signs. The <b>Governor's</b> <b>Safety</b> Committee adopted this sign as they felt that such a sign should be distinctive (not similar to any other type of sign) and easily visible to a driver attempting a passing maneuver...|$|R
