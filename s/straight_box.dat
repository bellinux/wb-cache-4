25|$|The DH.6 was {{specifically}} {{designed as a}} military trainer, {{at a time when}} it was usual for obsolete service types to be used in this role. Geoffrey de Havilland seems to have had two design criteria in mind. The first was that it should be inexpensive and easy to build, and above all, simple to repair after the mishaps common in training units. The top and bottom wings were square-cut and interchangeable, hence roundels often located in unusual positions. They were heavily cambered, and braced with cables rather than streamlined wires. On the original version of the type there was no stagger. Even the fin and rudder, on the prototype of the usual curved de Havilland outline, were cut square on production machines. The fuselage structure was a <b>straight</b> <b>box</b> with no attempt at refinement of outline – instructor and pupil sat in tandem on basketwork seats in a single cockpit, spartan even by the standards of the time. The standard engine was the readily-available 90hp (67kW) RAF 1a. Because of its use in the B.E.2 the engine was familiar to RFC mechanics. No cowling was used, and upswept straight exhaust pipes were fitted. When stocks of the RAF 1a ran short, other engines were fitted, including the 80hp (60kW) Renault.|$|E
25|$|In {{its second}} weekend, the film {{expanded}} to 4,022 theaters, thereby breaking its own record {{of being the}} widest Universal Pictures release ever, and earned an estimated $59.6 million, declining by 60%, which is the third best second weekend holdover for a pre-summer film release. It became the highest-grossing film in the Fast & Furious franchise, doing so only in ten days (the previous record which was held by Fast & Furious 6 took fifteen weeks to reach its entire lifetime gross of $238.67 million). It also set {{the record for the}} biggest second-weekend April gross. It topped the box office for four consecutive weekends, becoming the first film to top the box office for four consecutive weekends since The Hunger Games in March 2012 and one of only 29 films since 1985 to have had four <b>straight</b> <b>box</b> office wins during their theatrical runs, although this highly depends on many factors, including the release time and the competition around. It ended its theatrical run on July 24, 2015, playing in theaters for a total of 112 days and became the thirty-first highest-grossing film of all time, the fifth highest-grossing film of 2015, the highest-grossing film in The Fast and the Furious franchise, the second highest-grossing Universal film of 2015 (behind Jurassic World), and the fifth highest-grossing film distributed by Universal.|$|E
60|$|Maraton {{replaced}} {{the letters in}} their envelopes and turned with them in his hand, towards Julia. She had moved a little towards the open French windows. Every one seemed to have made their way out on to the lawn. Chinese lanterns were hanging {{from some of the}} trees and along the <b>straight</b> <b>box</b> hedge that led to the rose gardens. The women were strolling about in their evening gowns, without wraps or covering, and the men had joined them. Servants were passing coffee around, served from a table on which stood a little row of bottles, filled with various liqueurs. Some one in the drawing-room was singing, but the voice was suddenly silenced. Every one turned their heads. A little further back in the woods, a nightingale had commenced to sing.|$|E

50|$|Georgia Five is a 5-digit numbers game. Georgia 5 {{is drawn}} twice daily; {{it has a}} top prize of $10,000. It was {{introduced}} on August 1, 2010. Georgia Five is different from most pick-3 and pick-4 games; players do not choose <b>straight,</b> <b>box,</b> or similar wagers.

However, when people begin to question the authenticity of the win due to Maeda being two weight categories heavier than Hatanaka and him not fighting in a <b>straight</b> <b>boxing</b> match Maeda forces Hatanaka to fight him again. This time Hatanaka easily defeats the emaciated Maeda. He leaves Teiken to train at boxing at a prestigious college by the sea. He is very easy-going and cheerful, but can be moved to anger. He used to be one mistake away from being expelled from Teiken High. According to Hatanaka, Maeda has been the only one to knock him down yet in a boxing match and that no one at his college compares to him.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, the {{straight}} payout is over $250, {{and the box}} payout (where the three digits are different) averages $38. Unlike most lotteries, New Jersey pays winners of Pick-3 and Pick-4 on a parimutuel basis. Multiple wagers of the same number increase winnings.

5000|$|Film critic Dennis Schwartz {{discussed}} {{that the}} film had a definite sociopolitical {{point of view and}} praised Garfields work. He, wrote, [...] "Robert Rossens Body and Soul becomes more than a boxing and film noir tale, as screenwriter Abraham Polonsky makes this into a socialist morality drama where the pursuit of money becomes the focus that derails the common man in his quest for success ... Garfield is seen as a victim of the ruthless capitalistic system that fixes everything including athletic events, as the little guy is always {{at the mercy of the}} big operator. Its the kind of liberalism that was common in the dramas made in the 1930s. Its more a film about corruption and the presence of violence everywhere in America rather than a <b>straight</b> <b>boxing</b> film ... Body and Soul viewed at this late date lacks much relevancy and now only seems gripping because of Garfields gritty performance, and not because of the intense script that once made waves in powerful circles.|$|R
50|$|St. George's Church {{was officially}} {{established}} in 1852 with {{the appointment of}} the parish's first full-time priest, The Reverend Thomas W. Marsh. The first St. George's Church {{was built in the}} late eighteen forties on land donated to the church by Mr. and Mrs. George Kennedy. The original church was a plain frame structure with tower and spire. It contained <b>straight</b> <b>box</b> pews and in the centre was a square enclosure used by the choir; the music being supplied by a small cabinet organ.|$|E

The independent front suspension to Alviss own design is by transverse leaf springs. The semi-elliptic rear springs are underslung. Luvax hydraulic shock absorbers control the springing. A fully floating rear axle is fitted. Wire wheels with bolt-on hubs are supplied fitted with extra low-pressure tyres. Four-wheel, self-energising Girling brakes have large diameter drums which are ribbed for cooling.|$|E
50|$|The {{architect}} firm Klemming och Thelaus {{was awarded}} a contract from Umeå city to study {{the environmental impacts of}} a bridge placed next to the church, and to propose a design of the bridge and its abutment. The findings were, amongst other things, reported with a model in scale 1:400, with floor plans and a memorandum. The memorandum emphasized that the bridge should be parallel to Tegsbron, to fit into the orthogonal and regular structure of the land use in the city. It was also concluded that it was important that the bridge would be given a visual connection or relationship with Tegsbron. Therefore, the firm proposed a bridge with a <b>straight</b> <b>box</b> girder with straight vertical support.|$|E
5000|$|As in Pick-3, {{the most}} common Pick-4 wager is <b>Straight</b> and <b>Box</b> {{combined}} for $1.00 (some players will make separate [...] "straight" [...] and [...] "box" [...] wagers for the same Pick-4 number, so that the [...] "box" [...] wager, if won, can be collected without filling out a tax form.) Typically, the straight payout is over $2,000. Multiple wagers of the same number increase winnings.|$|R
5000|$|The M1 carbine entered {{service with}} a {{standard}} <b>straight</b> 15-round <b>box</b> magazine. The introduction of the select-fire M2 carbine in October 1944 also brought into service the curved 30-round magazine or [...] "Banana Clip".

50|$|After a {{few weeks}} the film went <b>straight</b> to video. <b>Box</b> office sales {{the first week in}} {{circulation}} were $19,528. Total sales for the run were $109,261 and in its widest release the film appeared in seven theatres.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, {{three more}} models were to follow. The M4 and M5 sought to become {{improvements}} on the M2, with stronger materials and better reliability. The new versions {{have a more}} rectangular look and are usually of blackened steel finish, while M1 - M3 were usually painted olive-green colour. Gepárd M5 is a bolt-action rifle for military sharpshooters and weighs only 13 kilograms, while the M4 is a semi-automatic anti-materiel rifle. The massive 10-round drum magazine, so characteristic of the M2 and M3, was replaced with a <b>straight</b> <b>box</b> magazine design with a capacity for five rounds. The later M4 and M5 can fire either Russian or NATO 12.7 mm ammunition as the gun barrel is field replaceable.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, {{three other}} {{variants}} of the vz. 61 {{were developed in}} Czechoslovakia: the vz. 64 (chambered for the [...]380 ACP (9×17mm Short) pistol cartridge), the vz. 65—designed for use with the 9×18mm Makarov cartridge, and the vz. 68 (in 9×19mm Parabellum); however, production of these variants was never undertaken. In the 1990s Česká zbrojovka offered the following submachine guns: the vz. 61 E (.32 ACP version with a plastic pistol grip), the vz. 82 (chambered in 9×18mm Makarov and featuring a 113 mm barrel) and the vz. 83 (for the [...]380 ACP cartridge). A semi-automatic only variant known as the CZ-91S was developed for the civilian market, available in the aforementioned calibers.

50|$|Even though Norway {{had adopted}} the repeating Jarmann rifle in 1884, {{it was soon}} {{clear that it was}} at best an interim weapon. Ole Krag, captain in the Norwegian Army and {{director}} of Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk (the government weapons factory), therefore continued the development of small arms, as he had since at least 1866. Not satisfied with the tubular magazine of the Jarmann rifle and his earlier Krag-Petersson rifle (adopted by the Royal Norwegian Navy in 1876), he enlisted the help of master gunsmith Erik Jørgensen. Together they developed the capsule magazine. The principal feature of the capsule magazine was that instead of being a <b>straight</b> <b>box</b> protruding below the stock of the rifle, it wrapped around the bolt action. Early models contained ten rounds and were fitted to modified versions of the Jarmann—though they could be adapted to any bolt-action rifle.In 1886, Denmark {{was on the verge of}} adopting a new rifle for its armed forces. One of the early prototypes of the new rifle was sent to Denmark. The feedback given by the Danes was vital in the further development of the weapon. The test performed in Denmark revealed the need to lighten the rifle, as well as the possible benefits of a completely new action. Krag and Jørgensen therefore decided to convert the magazine into what they referred to as a 'half-capsule', containing only five rounds of ammunition instead of the previous ten. They also, over the next several months, combined what they considered the best ideas from other gunsmiths with a number of their own ideas to design a distinct bolt action for their rifle. The long extractor, situated on top of the bolt, was inspired by the Jarmann mechanism, while the use of curved surfaces for cocking and ejecting the spent round was probably inspired by the designs from Mauser. For a time after the weapon was adopted by Denmark they experimented with dual frontal locking lugs, but decided against it on grounds of cost and weight. The ammunition of the day did not need dual frontal locking lugs, and the bolt already had three lugs—one in front, one just in front of the bolt handle, and the bolt handle itself—which were considered more than strong enough.|$|E

This paper {{presents the results}} of an experimental investigation and analytical studies. Based on the model experiment, the results and conclusions of shear lag in curved box girder with prestressing force are presented that prestressing force has changed shear lag distribution. The prestressing force action on box girder shall be considered comprehensively, structural force shall be analyzed accurately, optimize prestressing tendons shall be set rationally which would make force more rationally. The results highlighted that the impact factors of a curved box girder bridge have been observed to be generally very high, while those of the other responses are also relatively higher than that of corresponding <b>straight</b> <b>box</b> girder bridge...|$|E
