The samples in a packed bed of silicon had significantly higher mass gains compared to samples not in a packed bed. Comparison to diffusion studies suggest that the increase in mass gain of embedded samples is due to a higher silicon activity from the gas phase reaction with silicon.

This article {{describes how the}} electrical resistance of metal nanowire networks evolve under thermal annealing. Understanding the behavior of such films is crucial for the optimization of transparent electrodes which find many applications. An in-depth investigation of silver nanowire networks under different annealing conditions provides a case study demonstrating that several mechanisms, namely local sintering and desorption of organic residues, {{are responsible for the}} reduction of the systems electrical resistance. Optimization of the annealing led to specimens with transmittance of 90 % (at 550 nm) and sheet resistance of 9. 5 Omega sq(- 1).
