The holes were bent up at their edges so that the beveled edge stiffened the area around the hole. In some mats a T-shaped stake could be driven at intervals through the holes to keep the assembly in place on the ground. Sometimes the sheets were welded together.|$|E

50|$|In Germany {{the most}} popular home canning system is Weck jar. This system uses glass jars (80ml-2.5l) and glass bottles (200ml-1l), {{reusable}} rubber seals, glass lids, and a water bath canning sterilization process. During the canning process the lids are secured by <b>steel</b> tension <b>clips</b> which can be removed once a vacuum seal has formed. During storage the vertical position of the rubber seal's external tongue indicates {{the status of the}} sealing. Weck products are still produced and are available from German hardware stores. Used equipment is frequently sold on online auction sites and in opportunity shops. They can be used for water bath canning and pressure canning. For water bath canning use two <b>steel</b> tension <b>clips</b> and for pressure canning use three <b>steel</b> tension <b>clips.</b> Remove them after vacuum has formed.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the large}} amounts of heat given off by {{internal}} combustion engines, heat shields are used on most engines to protect components and bodywork from heat damage. As well as protection, effective heat shields can give a performance benefit by reducing the under-bonnet temperatures, therefore reducing the intake temperature. Heat shields vary widely in price, but most are easy to fit, usually by stainless <b>steel</b> <b>clips</b> or high temperature tape. There are two main types of automotive heat shield: ...|$|R
50|$|The nut {{is usually}} {{slightly}} {{loose in the}} cage to allow for minor adjustments in alignment. This reduces {{the likelihood that the}} threads will be stripped during equipment installation and removal. The dimensions of the spring <b>steel</b> <b>clip</b> determines thickness of the panel to which the nut may be clipped. In the case of square-hole cage nuts, the clip dimensions determine the range of hole sizes to which the clip will securely hold the nut. In the case of slide-on cage nuts, the clip dimensions determine the distance from the panel edge to the hole.|$|E

5000|$|An {{asymmetrical}} spring <b>steel</b> <b>clip</b> of ten {{rounds in}} a double-staggered column {{would then be}} inserted, feed end up, into the magazine against the spring pressure of the magazine follower; when fully inserted the clip would be caught and held by a catch. (Note: this clip, like the clip used in the Austrian Model 95 rifle, could only be inserted one way and thus could potentially cause confusion under the stress of combat). Unloading the magazine would be done by (if necessary) retracting and holding open the breech mechanism, then pushing the trigger forward from its neutral position; the clip and any remaining cartridges would be ejected upward.|$|E

50|$|Butterfly {{bombs in}} a submunitions {{container}} {{could have a}} mixture of different fuzes fitted to increase disruption to the target. Additionally, when a single fuze type with two operating functions was fitted (e.g. type 41), bombs in a submunitions container could have either or both possible fuze settings selected by the Luftwaffe ground crew. Fuze variants such as the 41A, 41B, 70B1, 70B2, etc., also existed. These variants were inserted into the fuze pocket via a bayonet fitting (the fuze was held in place via two <b>steel</b> <b>clips)</b> but otherwise functioned identically.|$|R
5000|$|The endoclip {{was first}} {{described}} by Hayashi and Kudoh in 1975, [...] and was termed the [...] "staunch clip". Initial attempts {{to incorporate the}} clip into applications in endoscopy (such as clipping bleeding blood vessels) were limited by the applicator system of the clip. [...] However, by 1988, an easy to use applicator delivery system was developed, and a functional reloadable endoclip system was described. [...] This consisted of a stainless <b>steel</b> <b>clip</b> (of size approximately 6 mm long and 1.2 mm wide at the prongs) with a metal deployment device (that {{could be used to}} insert the clip into the endoscopic camera, and deployed outside the camera) enclosed in a plastic sheath. [...] These clips were initially reloadable.|$|E
50|$|The medal {{is round}} {{and made of}} bronze from {{captured}} French cannons, medals for officers were gilded. The medal is 1+7/20 in in diameter. The obverse depicts, in a left facing profile, the fallen Duke of Brunswick, Frederick William. Around the edge is the inscription, in German Script, FRIEDRICH WILHELM HERZOG. The reverse of the medal bears the date 1815 in the centre, surrounded by a wreath of oak and laurels. Around {{the outside of the}} wreath is the inscription, Braunschweig Seinen Kriegern (Brunswick to her Warriors) above, and Quatrebras und Waterloo below. The medal is suspended from a <b>steel</b> <b>clip</b> and ring attached to a ribbon 1+1/2 in wide. The ribbon is yellow with blue edge stripes 3/8 in wide.|$|E
5000|$|Shuttles were {{constructed}} from a dense heavy hardwood with metal tips. The wood was traditionally box. Imported timbers such as persimmon and cornel were also commonly used. The shuttle was shaped and hollowed using conventional wood working techniques, the metal tips are pressed onto the block. Strips of fox fur or similar were {{stuck to the}} inside of a shuttle to stop the thread ballooning as it left the pirn. There are many designs of shuttle. The Pemberton Loom needed a shuttle with a hinged shuttle-peg to hold the pirn; the later Draper loom shuttles clasped metal rings on the head of the pirn using a spring <b>steel</b> <b>clip.</b> The Draper Company claimed it had developed over 5000 different types of shuttle to meet [...] "the needs of the mills and the whims of the weavers".|$|E

5000|$|... 1929: The {{introduction}} of the cable binding allowed the Christie turn to become a standard on downhill runs, and to further support this style of skiing the Swiss racer Guido Reuge in 1929 invented a cable binding with <b>steel</b> <b>clips</b> below the boot heel to enable clamping the heel down for downhill portions. He named the product [...] "Kandahar" [...] for the international Kandahar Cup ski races. In use in alpine races, the Kandahar binding led to serious leg injuries, and by 1939 experimentation began in earnest on bindings that would release the boot in a fall.|$|R

50|$|The medal was minted of silver. The {{design of}} the obverse {{contained}} a laurel wreath with mural crown {{at the top of}} a shield with the inscription KELAT-I-GHILZIE. The reverse has a trophy of arms on top of a plaque bearing the inscription 'INVICTA MDCCCXLII'. The medal is suspended by a pin, which passes through a <b>steel</b> <b>clip</b> attached to the top of the medal. The ribbon is the watered rainbow colored ribbon common to most East India Company medals. It is red on the left edge fading into white, which changed to yellow in the center, fading back to white, until finally changing to blue at the right edge. The medals were engraved with the name of the recipient in script on the edge for the medals issued to British personnel. The medals issued to the indigenous troops were not engraved with names.|$|E
50|$|This problem {{persists}} {{today in}} spite of the many different retention systems that have been engineered. Hubcaps generally use either clip-on retention, where some type of spring <b>steel</b> <b>clip</b> (or plastic clip in the case of plastic hubcaps) engages a groove in the wheel; or bolt-on retention, where a threaded fastener retains the hubcap, or a plastic washer attached to the lugnut itself holds the hubcap on. Honda and, to a lesser degree, Hyundai tend to use the latter system. Clip-on hubcaps tend to pop off suddenly when the wheel impacts a pothole or curbstone, while bolt-on hubcaps are more likely to vibrate loose over time, and tend to rattle and squeak. To prevent loss, many owners attach plastic wheel trims to the wheel itself using an electrical zip tie, which are sold in a silver colour for this very purpose. Enterprising manufacturers also sell a small kit consisting of spare zip ties, a pair of cutting pliers and latex gloves to allow a trim thus secured to be removed easily {{in the event of a}} puncture.|$|E
40|$|Background We {{tested the}} {{hypotheses}} that long-term ad-ministration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor fosinopril will regress hypertrophy, modify the tran-sition to heart failure, and prolong survival in rats with chronic left ventricular (LV) pressure overload due to ascending aortic stenosis. Methods and Results Aortic stenosis {{was created in}} wean-ling male Wistar rats by a stainless <b>steel</b> <b>clip</b> placed on the ascending aorta. Age-matched control animals underwent a sham operation (Sham group, n= 57). Six weeks after surgery, rats with aortic stenosis were randomized to receive either oral fosinopril 50 mg * kg 1 Ì€ d- 1 (Fos/LVH group, n= 38) or no drug (LVH group, n= 36) for 15 weeks.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} SIMM sockets were conventional push-type sockets. These {{were soon}} replaced by ZIF sockets {{in which the}} SIMM was inserted at an angle, then tilted into an upright position. To remove one, the two metal or plastic clips at each end must be pulled to the side, then the SIMM must be tilted back and pulled out (low-profile sockets reversed this convention somewhat, like SODIMMs - the modules are inserted at a [...] "high" [...] angle, then pushed down to become more flush with the motherboard). The earlier sockets used plastic retainer clips which were found to break, so <b>steel</b> <b>clips</b> replaced them.|$|R
