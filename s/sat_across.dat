5|$|Tank was a {{commercial}} success and {{is credited with}} buoying the finances of the newly merged Atari at a critical time for the company. It sold over 10,000 units, considered a large hit at the time, though Ralph H. Baer claims that was only the 1974 sales, with a further 5,000 sold in 1975. Atari produced a second version of the game, a cocktail cabinet form {{in which the two}} players <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> a circular table from each other. A sequel, Tank II, was released in 1974 to sales of around 1,000 units; gameplay was identical, though the maze could be changed to a new format by modifying the circuitry and more sound effects were added. It was followed by three further sequels: Tank III in 1975, the first game to be third in a series; the color Tank 8 in 1976, which featured eight tanks and players simultaneously; and Ultra Tank in 1978, which reverted to a two-player black and white game with the ability to select multiple different maze types and have invisible tanks.|$|E

Interviewers take turns {{to ask the}} candidate set questions and rate their responses on a Likert scale. Interviews last between 15–30 minutes. Questions cover a range of desirable criteria that future doctors should possess.|$|E
25|$|Several {{hours after}} the ambush, {{suspected}} CJNG gunmen based in Zacoalco de Torres killed Miguel Ángel Caicedo Vargas, the police chief of that municipality. According to investigators, the police chief was kidnapped and tortured before being killed. The assassins stabbed cardboard onto the corpse with a written message warning law enforcement that he was killed {{for the death of}} El Gringo. His body was dumped in a car wash shop in Zacoalco de Torres. Witnesses stated that the assassins were driving a white Suburban with Sinaloa license plates. Jalisco authorities stated that this execution and the ambush were both doings of the CJNG. Municipal authorities from Zacoalco de Torres refused to provide details on the murder, and did not say if they were planning to host a memorial ceremony for Caicedo Vargas. Citizens from Zacoalco de Torres said they were worried about the situation in their town; in 15 days, the town hosted the shootout where El Gringo was killed and the murder of its local police chief. Locals stated that there was a strong presence of the Jalisco State Police following both incidents. A memorial service was carried out at the city's convention center on April 8. The police department where Caicedo Vargas worked, which <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> the street from the convention center, placed a black ribbon in front of their main entrance. The PGR took over the ambush case, and stated that it would charge the suspects with organized crime, illegal possession of firearms, and homicide. This placed the investigation under federal jurisdiction.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1981 and 1987, {{the pair}} {{performed}} [...] "Nightsea Crossing" [...] in twenty-two performances. They <b>sat</b> silently <b>across</b> {{from each other}} in chairs for seven hours a day.|$|R
25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E
500|$|Arriving in {{the city}} with just ₤3, he moved into lodgings at 48 Langham Street, near Great Titchfield Street, a penny bus ride from the British Museum. The house <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> an alley from the Yorkshire Grey pub, which made an {{appearance}} in the Pisan Cantos, [...] "concerning the landlady's doings / with a lodger unnamed / az waz near Gt Titchfield St. {{next door to the}} pub".|$|E
500|$|On June 18, 1779, {{shortly after}} the Battle of Stony Point, Howe was ordered to assist General Israel Putnam in assaulting a British {{fortification}} at Verplanck's Point, which <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> the Hudson River from Stony Point. [...] Howe was charged with commanding the artillery barrage and infantry assault of that position, but was given too few field pieces, entrenching tools, provisions, and little ammunition to make a serious attempt at taking the fortification. He advised Washington that an assault would be unfeasible and called off the siege with Washington's consent. Historians have noted that Howe's inability to take the British fortifications damaged his career {{and that he was}} never again given a major command. [...] Contemporaries such as General William Irvine criticized Howe as [...] "having a talent...of finding many supposed obstructions, and barely plausible pretences for his delay" [...] in assaulting Verplanck's Point.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh yes! Do!" [...] he begged, and she <b>sat</b> down <b>across</b> {{the table}} from him. [...] "I'm ashamed to make this trouble for you," [...] he added. [...] "I didn't know it was so late." ...|$|R
60|$|A silence followed, {{which she}} endeavoured to break, but she <b>sat</b> still <b>across</b> the little table from him where the shaded lamp spread its glow, leaving {{the rest of}} the room, with its red {{curtains}} and its sketches pinned about, in a warm, luxurious shadow. Her eyes fell, and she did not speak.|$|R
500|$|After {{the birth}} of their child, the Fitzgeralds moved to Great Neck, New York, on Long Island, in October 1922. The town was used as the scene of The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald's neighbors in Great Neck {{included}} such prominent and newly wealthy New Yorkers as writer Ring Lardner, actor Lew Fields, and comedian Ed Wynn. These figures were all considered to be [...] "new money", unlike those who came from Manhasset Neck or Cow Neck Peninsula, places which were home to many of New York's wealthiest established families, and which <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> the bay from Great Neck. This real-life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for [...] "West Egg" [...] and [...] "East Egg". In this novel, Great Neck (King's Point) became the [...] "new money" [...] peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington (Sands Point) the old-money East Egg. Several mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby's home, such as Oheka Castle and Beacon Towers, since demolished.|$|E
2500|$|Paul Fannin, Harrison Schmitt, Roger Jepsen, and Steve Symms all {{continued}} the new candy desk tradition, in that order, after Murphy's one term was over. Fannin, Schmitt, and Jepsen supplied only hard candy, but Symms {{was the first}} to stock sweets supplied by [...] "candy and chocolate associations." [...] During the tenures of these senators, the candy desk was not fixed to one particular spot. Senate seating charts show Schmitt, during his time with the candy desk, sat one seat to the right of its traditional spot for the 95th Congress, and then <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> the aisle from the traditional spot for the 96th.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know, really," [...] he answered, {{glancing at}} {{her where she}} <b>sat</b> erect <b>across</b> the table from him, with {{her hand on the}} lid of the coffee-pot, and her eyes downcast; it was the face of silent {{determination}} not to be put off, which he knew. [...] "I don't suppose you care, mother," [...] he added pleasantly.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{order the}} outfit in the morning," [...] he said presently, glancing toward {{a man who}} <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> the room. [...] "Do you think that fellow Clarke can hear? I've a notion that he's been {{watching}} us." ...|$|E
60|$|Dick Hardman <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> {{the room}} from Pan and behind the teacher's back he made ugly faces at Pan and, more than that, put his nose to his thumb. Pan {{understood}} that, and quick as a flash, he returned the compliment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on," [...] said Cavor, as I <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> {{the edge}} of the manhole, and looked down into the black {{interior}} of the sphere. We two were alone. It was evening, the sun had set, and the stillness of the twilight was upon everything.|$|E
60|$|Hetty {{was married}} in haste, {{without benefit of}} clergy, while several men, with {{resolute}} faces, kept watch outside the judge's door, and two who were mounted <b>sat</b> gazing <b>across</b> the prairie on a rise outside the town. After the declarations were made and signed, the judge turned to Hetty, who stood smiling bravely, though her eyes were a trifle misty, by Larry's side.|$|R
5000|$|Anya Liftig's work {{focuses on}} the body and its {{relationship}} to other bodies, other people, and the built environment. She is perhaps best known for her 2010 performance entitled [...] "The Anxiety of Influence," [...] in which she <b>sat</b> directly <b>across</b> from artist Marina Abramovic {{for most of the day}} at the Museum of Modern Art (New York) during Abramovic's performance entitled [...] "The Artist Is Present." ...|$|R

Do my utmost, Louisa, I couldn't compass a thrill." ...|$|R
60|$|The Old Gentleman <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> {{the table}} glowing like a smoked pearl at his corner-stone of future ancient Tradition.

60|$|She mothered {{him with}} her voice, with an ineffable {{tenderness}} in it that I yearned to appropriate. I glanced at him.

[...] He had sat down with his hat on, as his {{absent-minded}} habit was, and he now braced his knees {{against the edge of}} the table. Cynthia <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> it from him with her head drooped over it, drawing vague figures on the board with her finger. [...] "What are you goin' to do?" ...|$|E
40|$|Variations in sea ice freeze onset and {{regional}} sea surface temperatures (SST) in Baffin Bay and Greenland Sea {{are linked to}} autumn surface air temperatures (SAT) around coastal Greenland through 500 hPa blocking patterns, 1979 - 2014. We find strong, statistically significant correlations between Baffin Bay freeze onset and SSTs and <b>SATs</b> <b>across</b> the western and southernmost coastal areas, while weaker and fewer significant correlations are found between eastern SATs, SSTs, and freeze periods observed in the neighboring Greenland Sea. Autumn Greenland Blocking Index (GBI) values and the incidence of meridional circulation patterns have increased over the modern sea ice monitoring era. Increased anticyclonic blocking patterns promote poleward transport of warm air from lower latitudes and local warm air advection onshore from ocean-atmosphere sensible heat exchange through ice-free or thin ice-covered seas bordering the coastal stations. Temperature composites by years of extreme late freeze conditions, occurring since 2006 in Baffin Bay, reveal positive monthly SAT departures that often exceed one standard deviation from the 1981 - 2010 climate norma...|$|R
60|$|The Pole gulped down a hasty meal, {{talking as}} he ate. Cole <b>sat</b> silently <b>across</b> from him, not eating or speaking. His old {{clothing}} {{had been taken}} away and new clothing given him. He was shaved and rubbed down. His sores and cuts were healed, his body and hair washed. He looked much healthier and younger, now. But he was still stooped and tired, his blue eyes worn and faded. He listened to Sherikov's account {{of the world of}} 2136 AD without comment.|$|R
60|$|Molly <b>sat</b> {{staring out}} <b>across</b> the garden. At first, every word {{had been a}} stab. Several times, she {{had been on the}} point of crying out that she could bear it no longer. But, gradually, a {{numbness}} succeeded the pain. She found herself listening apathetically.|$|R
60|$|A wild {{little village}} came in sight. This was the destination. Again no. Only the tall, {{handsome}} mountain youth who had <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> from her, descended grumbling because the 'bus {{had brought him}} past his road, the driver having refused to pull up. Everybody expostulated with him, and he dropped into the shadow. The big priest squeezed into his place. The 'bus wound on and on, and always towards that hollow sky-line between the high peaks.|$|E
60|$|However {{there was}} no use in {{stopping}} where I was, so I came down the mountain and found myself in a flat plain which was bounded by the sea. I travelled towards it, and {{was pleased to see}} a vessel moored about half a mile from shore. There were no waves, so I broke off the branch of a tree, and dragging it down to the water's edge, <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> it, while, using two sticks for oars, I rowed myself towards the ship.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{his home}} coming {{proved to be}} a happier event than he had ever dared to hope for. Lucy was quiet and ate but little. At times Pan caught her {{stealing}} a glimpse at him, and each time she blushed. She could not meet his eyes again. Alice too stole shy glances at him, wondering, loving. Bobby was hungry, but he did not forget that Pan <b>sat</b> <b>across</b> from him. Mrs. Smith watched Pan with an expression that would have pained him had he allowed remorse to come back then. And his father was funny. He tried to be natural, to meet Pan on a plane of the old western insouciance, but it was impossible. No doubt such happiness had not reigned in that household for years.|$|E
50|$|Chrysler-Simca's {{planners}} {{also wanted}} {{a car with}} more than just two seats. Guédon agreed, {{but he was also}} not satisfied with the 2+2 arrangement used in the M530, feeling that the rear seats were too small to be really useful. The solution came to him on a lengthy trip he took in a Ford Taunus station wagon with two colleagues. The back of the car was so full that the travelers <b>sat</b> three <b>across</b> {{in the front of the}} car. The M550 sat three abreast.|$|R
60|$|Still, {{there was}} no sign of discouragement in the voices or the faces--it may be said, in the souls--of the man and woman who <b>sat</b> there talking <b>across</b> a table. He was as full of hope as ever he was, and she as full of faith.|$|R
60|$|There {{was another}} burst of laughter; and when Mr. Oliver {{had taken his}} place, with the boys seated near him, Frank noticed {{for the first time}} that Mr. Barclay {{occupied}} a chair close by. Then he also saw that Mr. Marston, who had written to him, <b>sat</b> almost opposite <b>across</b> the table.|$|R
