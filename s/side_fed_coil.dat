This antenna consists of a printed monopole, {{with one or two}} sleeves on each <b>side,</b> <b>fed</b> by a coplanar waveguide (CPW) line. Switches are used to control the length of the monopole and the sleeves and to tune the resonant frequencies of the antenna. In the case of the double-sleeved antenna, the switch is used to connect or disconnect a second sleeve in the cactus antenna. Measurement results show that the cactus antenna maintains the dipole-like ra-diation patterns for all the different resonant frequencies.

The proposed protective concept implements a simple current signal sequential over lapping derivative, SOD transform to detect transmission line transient disturbances.

The proposed unit protective relaying concept is applied to two <b>sides</b> <b>fed</b> transmission lines. The simulation results presented show that the protective concept is simple with high reliability, sensitivity and achieve an extra high speed relaying.

American naval and Marine aviation made Rabaul a frequent bombing target.A Japanese airfield was spotted under construction at Guadalcanal. The Americans made an amphibious landing in August 1942 to seize it, sent in the Cactus Air Force and started to reverse the tide of Japanese conquests. As a result, Japanese and Allied forces both occupied various parts of Guadalcanal. Over the following six months, both <b>sides</b> <b>fed</b> resources into an escalating battle of attrition on the island, at sea, and in the sky, with eventual victory going to the Americans in February 1943. It was a campaign the Japanese could ill afford. A majority of Japanese aircraft from the entire South Pacific area was drained into the Japanese defence of Guadalcanal. Japanese logistics, as happened time and again, failed; only 20% of the supplies dispatched from Rabaul to Guadalcanal ever reached there.|$|R
5000|$|The {{colonial era}} Hindu revivalism and mobilisation, along with Hindu nationalism, states Peter van der Veer, was {{primarily}} a reaction to and competition with Muslim separatism and Muslim nationalism. The successes of each <b>side</b> <b>fed</b> the fears of the other, leading {{to the growth of}} Hindu nationalism and Muslim nationalism in the Indian subcontinent. In the 20th century, the sense of religious nationalism grew in India, states van der Veer, but only Muslim nationalism succeeded with the formation of the West and East Pakistan (later split into Pakistan and Bangladesh), as [...] "an Islamic state" [...] upon independence. Religious riots and social trauma followed as millions of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs moved out of the newly created Islamic states and resettled into the Hindu-majority post-British India. After the separation of India and Pakistan in 1947, the Hindu nationalism movement developed the concept of Hindutva in second half of the 20th century.|$|R

50|$|Gusev, who was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} colonel-general on 18 June, was ordered to continue the offensive further north to break the Finnish defences at the villages of Tali northeast of Vyborg and at Ihantala north of Vyborg. The renewed offensive began on 25 June against IV Corps’ defences in the Tali area. After four days of intense fighting, during which both <b>sides</b> <b>fed</b> reserves into the battle, the Finns were pushed back, but their lines did not break. On 3 July, 21st Army attacked Finnish defensive positions at Ihantala, but the attack had been anticipated by the Finns and after several days of effort, 21st Army’s forces had made few gains. By 6 July, after four weeks of intense fighting and after having sustained heavy casualties, 21st Army’s offensive capacity was exhausted. Within days some of 21st Army’s best units were being withdrawn for deployment to other Soviet armies further south, and by mid-July the offensive in the Karelian Isthmus had been terminated. 21st Army remained with Leningrad Front until the end of September 1944, when it was again returned to the high command reserve.|$|R
