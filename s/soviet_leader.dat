[...] This {{was followed by the}} maiden visit to India of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders,</b> Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev in 1955. Jawaharlal Nehru, frankly put forward to the visiting <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> that the Communist Party of India was claiming to receive direction from the CPSU.|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} posited that Lavrenty Beria, Nikita Khrushchev and others conspired to use {{warfarin}} to poison <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> Joseph Stalin. Warfarin is tasteless and colourless, and produces symptoms {{similar to those}} that Stalin exhibited.|$|E

50|$|Lunacharsky's {{notion that}} {{religion}} was a complex phenomena with many aspects stood {{in contrast to}} the views of other <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> {{in the early days of}} the USSR who thought religion would disappear with the changing material conditions, under the Marxist presumption that religion and all ideology was simply a product of material conditions. Lunacharsky's ideas concerning the complex nature of religious existence was later adopted by other <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders.</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{the success}} of Sputnik 1 in October 1957, Nikita Khrushchev, the <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader,</b> wanted a {{spacecraft}} launched on 7 November 1957, the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

5|$|In {{dealing with}} Stalin, Truman {{decided to give}} the <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> vague hints about the {{existence}} of a powerful new weapon without going into details. However, the other Allies were unaware that Soviet intelligence had penetrated the Manhattan Project in its early stages, so Stalin already knew of the existence of the atomic bomb but did not appear impressed by its potential.|$|E
5|$|The primary <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> was Marshal Semyon Timoshenko, {{a veteran}} of World War I and the Russian Civil War. Timoshenko had {{achieved}} some success at the Battle of Smolensk in 1941 but was eventually defeated. Timoshenko orchestrated the victory at Rostov during the winter counter-attacks and more success in the spring offensive at Kharkov before the battle itself. Overseeing {{the actions of the}} army was Military Commissar Nikita Khrushchev.|$|E

50|$|Despite initial {{fears of}} greater instability, the {{deployment}} of GLCM ultimately caused <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> {{to enter into negotiations}} for, and finally signature of, the INF treaty. The recognition by <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> of the threat posed by the GLCM and Pershing II missiles made them far more inclined to agree to negotiate their own intermediate-range weapons, especially the SS-20, out of service, in exchange for the elimination of the threat posed by the GLCM and the Pershing II.|$|R
5|$|After {{the death}} of Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev became the <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> {{following}} the deposition and execution of Lavrentiy Beria and the pushing aside of rivals Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov. On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party by cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes. As part of a campaign of de-Stalinization, he declared {{that the only way}} to reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past.|$|E
5|$|American {{journalist}} H. R. Knickerbocker, who had met both Hitler and Hess, {{speculated that}} Hitler had sent Hess {{to deliver a}} message informing Winston Churchill of the forthcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, and offering a negotiated peace or even an anti-Bolshevik partnership. <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> Joseph Stalin believed that Hess's flight had been engineered by the British. Stalin persisted in this belief as late as 1944, when he mentioned the matter to Churchill, who insisted {{that they had no}} advance knowledge of the flight.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the dimes were released, {{relations}} with the USSR were deteriorating, and Sinnock's initials, JS, were deemed by some to refer to <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> Joseph Stalin, placed there by a communist sympathizer. Once these rumors reached Congress, the Mint sent out press releases debunking this myth. Despite the Mint's denial, there were rumors into the 1950s {{that there had been}} a secret deal at the Yalta Conference to honor Stalin on a U.S. coin. The controversy was given fresh life in 1948 with the posthumous release of Sinnock's Franklin half dollar, which bears his initials JRS.|$|E
50|$|After Brezhnev's {{death in}} 1982 Ryabenko {{supervised}} security of dachas of <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders.</b> He retired in 1987 {{and died in}} March 1993, aged 77.|$|R
50|$|In the USSR, the karakul hat {{became very}} popular among Politburo members. It became common that <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> {{appeared}} in public, wearing {{this type of}} hat. The hat probably gained its prestige among Party leaders {{because it was an}} obligatory parade attribute of the czar and Soviet generals. By wearing the karakul hat, <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> wanted to underline their high political status. In the Soviet Union this hat also took the nickname the pie-hat because it resembled traditional Russian pies.|$|R

5|$|During the Second World War, Sikorski became Prime Minister of the Polish Government in Exile, Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces, and a {{vigorous}} {{advocate of the}} Polish cause in the diplomatic sphere. He supported the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, which had been severed after the Soviet pact with Germany and the 1939 invasion of Poland— however, <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> Joseph Stalin broke off Soviet-Polish diplomatic relations in April 1943 following Sikorski's request that the International Red Cross investigate the Katyń Forest massacre.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{was aware}} that the Americans {{were working on the}} atomic bomb and, given that the Soviets' own rival program was in place, he reacted to the news calmly. The <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> said he was pleased by the news and {{expressed}} the hope that the weapon would be used against Japan. One week {{after the end of the}} Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan.|$|E
5|$|Viktor Ilyin, a disenfranchised Soviet soldier, {{attempted}} to assassinate Brezhnev on 22 January 1969 by firing shots at a motorcade carrying Brezhnev through Moscow. Though Brezhnev was unhurt, the shots killed a driver and lightly injured several celebrated cosmonauts of the Soviet space programme {{who were also}} travelling in the motorcade. Brezhnev's attacker was captured, and interrogated personally by Andropov, then KGB chairman and future <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader.</b> Ilyin was not given the death penalty because his desire to kill Brezhnev was considered so absurd that {{he was sent to}} the Kazan mental asylum instead for treatment.|$|E
5000|$|... "We {{believe that}} recent events do not {{indicate}} that the USSR has ceased to desire a conference at the summit or lower level negotiations on matters in which the <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> have an interest. At the same time, the <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> may have concluded prior to undertaking their recent moves that, since the chances of an early summit conference on their terms were waning, they could more easily accept the political losses they would suffer in international affairs by pursuing a harder policy in Eastern Europe." ...|$|R

5|$|While {{during the}} late 1920s and early 1930s {{relations}} with the Soviet Union became normalized to a degree, from 1938 on, the Soviets, anxious that Finland {{could be used as}} a springboard for an invasion, started negotiations to conclude a military agreement. At the same time, <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> Joseph Stalin's desire to recover the territories of Tsarist Russia lost during the chaos of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War made Finland an obvious target. Due to the nature of Soviet demands, which included the installation of Soviet military facilities on Finnish soil, these negotiations went nowhere.|$|E
5|$|Before Gorbachev's {{visit to}} Washington, D.C., {{for the third}} summit in 1987, the <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> {{announced}} his intention to pursue significant arms agreements. The timing of the announcement led Western diplomats to contend that Gorbachev was offering major concessions to the United States on the levels of conventional forces, nuclear weapons, and policy in Eastern Europe. He and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) at the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START I; Reagan insisted that {{the name of the}} treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{skepticism}} in the West, the new <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> {{proved to}} be committed to reversing the Soviet Union's deteriorating economic condition instead of continuing the arms race with the West. Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions. Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption {{at the top of the}} Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee. Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations.|$|E
