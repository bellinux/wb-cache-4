40|$|AbstractCarvedilol (Kredex, Coreg) is a {{multiple}} action antihypertensive drug {{that has been}} shown to protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidative damages. In this study the physical and structural effects of carvedilol on lipid bilayers are investigated by fluorescence techniques, differential scanning calorimetry and other physical methods. Carvedilol binds to liposomal membranes (9 : 1 DMPC:DMPG) strongly with an apparent binding constant on the order of 104 M− 1 in PBS (pH 7. 4). The characteristic changes in its intrinsic fluorescence properties when bound to liposomes suggest that this compound is situated in a non-polar environment. The <b>Stern-Volmer</b> and <b>bimolecular</b> <b>quenching</b> constants, determined using nitrate as the fluorescence quencher, for the free and bound carvedilol indicate that the carbazole moiety is at a depth of > 11 Å in the lipid bilayer. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements show that, unlike the membrane probes DPH and TMA-DPH, carvedilol is relatively mobile, and does not have a rigidly-defined molecular orientation in the bilayers. Differential scanning calorimetry results indicate that carvedilol is an effective membrane ‘fluidizer’ as it dose-dependently lowers the gel to liquid crystalline transition temperature and broadens the endothermic transition. Comparative studies of interactions of carbazole, 4 -OH carbazole and carvedilol with the model liposomal membranes reveal a possible role of membrane-partitioning in their antioxidant efficacy. These findings are discussed in perspective with the membrane biophysical properties of different classes of therapeutic significant lipid antioxidants in mind...|$|R

The structures of [Re(N) (dmppe) 2 Cl]+ and [Re(O) 2 (dmppe) 2]+ have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The electronic absorption bands of the nitrido complexes at ca. 230 - 300 nm are assigned as intraligand and ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transitions [p(π) (N 3 -) → d(π*) (Re) and p(π) (Cl-) → d(π*) (Re) ] and the weak absorption at ca. 360 - 480 nm as a (d(xy)) 2 → (d(xy)) 1 (d(π*)) 1 transition (d(π*) = d(xz), d(yz)).

Evidence of ligand-induced (oleic acid) {{structural changes}} in serum albumin are shown in both time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence quenching and anisotropy measurements of tryptophan 214 (Trp 214). These studies were augmented with column chromatography separations. It was found that both the steady-state and time-resolved Stern-Volmer collisional <b>quenching</b> <b>studies</b> of Trp 214 with acrylamide pointed {{to the existence of}} an oleate-dependent structural transformation. The <b>bimolecular</b> <b>quenching</b> rate constant of defatted human serum albumin, 1. 96 × 109 M− 1 s− 1, decreased to 0. 94 × 109 M− 1 s− 1 after incubation with oleic acid (9 : 1). Furthermore, Stern-Volmer <b>quenching</b> <b>studies</b> following fractionation of the structural forms by hydrophobic interaction chromatography were in accordance with this interpretation. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements of the Trp 214 residue yielded information of motion within the protein together with the whole protein molecule. Characteristic changes in these motions were observed after the binding of oleate to albumin. The addition of oleate was accompanied by an increase in the rotational diffusion time of the albumin molecule from ∼ 22 to 33. 6 ns. Within the body of the protein, however, the rotational diffusion time for Trp 214 exhibited a slight decrease from 191 to 182 ps and was accompanied by a decrease in the extent of the angular motion of Trp 214, indicating a transition after oleate binding to a more spatially restricted but less viscous environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{theory for}} {{quenching}} of fluorescently labeled membranes by dynamic quenchers is described for a three-phase system: a fluorescently labeled membrane, a nonlabeled membrane, and an aqueous phase. Two different experimental protocols are {{possible to determine}} quenching parameters. Using the first protocol, partition coefficients and <b>bimolecular</b> <b>quenching</b> constants were determined for a hydrophobic quencher in carbazole-labeled membranes {{in the presence of}} an unlabeled reference membrane. These parameters determined for 1, 1 -dichloro- 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDE) using this three-phase analysis were in good agreement with values determined by a two-phase analysis without the reference lipid. Hence, the theory was verified. In the second protocol, the quencher partition coefficient was determined for unlabeled membranes {{in the presence of a}} carbazole-labeled reference membrane. Partition coefficients for DDE determined by this method were the same as partition coefficients determined for carbazole-labeled membranes using the two-phase analysis. The greater ease in determining partition coefficients and <b>bimolecular</b> <b>quenching</b> constants by the three-phase analysis and, in particular, the ability to determine the partition coefficient in unlabeled membranes make the three-phase analysis especially useful. This method was used to study the effect varying the membrane lipid composition has on the partition coefficient. The data indicate that partition coefficients of DDE in fluid membranes are not dramatically dependent upon polar head group composition, fatty acid composition, or cholesterol content. However, partitioning into gel-phase lipids is at least 100 -fold less than fluid-phase lipids...|$|R

Stern–Volmer analysis of the luminescence quenching data provides rate constants for the <b>bimolecular</b> excited-state <b>quenching</b> reactions. H/D kinetic isotope effects for the pyridylphenols are on the order of 2. 0, and the <b>bimolecular</b> <b>quenching</b> reactions are up to 100  times faster with the pyridylphenols than with the reference phenols. This observation is attributed to the markedly less positive oxidation potentials of the pyridylphenols with respect to the reference phenols (≈ 0. 5  V), which in turn is caused by proton coupling of the phenol oxidation process. Transient absorption spectroscopy provides unambiguous evidence for the photogeneration of phenoxyl radicals, that is, the overall photoreaction is clearly a proton-coupled electron-transfer process...|$|R

Currently, this protein-protein interaction is poorly characterized and {{this study was}} aimed at identifying the contact sites between eEF 2 and the catalytic domain of ETA (PE 24 H, an ETA from P. aeruginosa, a 24 kDa C-terminal fragment containing a His 6 tag). Single-cysteine residues were introduced into the toxin at 21 defined surface-exposed sites and labelled with the fluorophore, IAEDANS [5 -(2 -iodoacetylaminoethylamino) - 1 -napthalenesulphonic acid]. Fluorescence <b>quenching</b> <b>studies</b> using acrylamide, and fluorescence lifetime and wavelength emission maxima analyses were conducted in the presence and absence of eEF 2. Large changes in the microenvironment of the AEDANS [5 -(2 -aminoethylamino) - 1 -naphthalenesulphonic acid] probe after eEF 2 binding were not observed as dictated by both fluorescence lifetime and wavelength emission maxima values. This supported the proposed minimal contact model, which suggests that only small, discrete contacts occur between these proteins. As dictated by the <b>bimolecular</b> <b>quenching</b> constant (k(q)) for acrylamide, binding of eEF 2 with toxin caused the greatest change in acrylamide accessibility (> 50 %) when the fluorescence label was near the active site or was located within a known catalytic loop. All mutant proteins showed a decrease in accessibility to acrylamide once eEF 2 bound, although the relative change varied for each labelled protein. From these data, a low-resolution model of the toxin-eEF 2 complex was constructed based on the minimal contact model {{with the intention of}} enhancing our knowledge on the mode of inactivation of the ribosome translocase by the Pseudomonas toxin...|$|R

The tetramisole derivative quenched the fluorescence of the intramembrane probe 8 -(2 -anthryl) -octanoic acid. The quenching process could be rationalized by a model for dynamic quenching in which an intermediate excited-state non-emitting complex (PQ) * between neutral quencher (Q) and excited probe (P*) is involved: Q(A) half-arrow-right-over-half-arrow-left Q(L) + P(L) * k(-d) half-arrow-right-over-half-arrow-left k(d) (PQ) L* [...] > k(i) P + Q where k(d), k(-d) and k(i) represent the rate constants of complex formation, dissociation and deactivation, respectively. The subscripts A and L denote the aqueous and lipid phases, and the asterisk indicates the excited state. Linear Stern-Volmer plots were obtained from quenching experiments of fluorescence intensities and fluorescence lifetimes. The slopes of the plots were dependent on the lipid volume fraction of the liposomes. Measurement of the reciprocal of the apparent <b>bimolecular</b> <b>quenching</b> rate constant at various lipid volume fractions yielded the partition coefficient K(p) and the overall quenching rate constant k(q) [k(q) = k(d) k(i) /(k(i) + k(-d) ] of the tetramisole derivative. The steady-state measurements were performed at three different pH-values. Time-correlated single photon counting measurements revealed a single-exponential fluorescence decay for 8 -(2 -anthryl) -octanoic acid in the presence and absence of quencher. The quenching results were in accordance with the model that only the neutral form is capable of partitioning into the lipid phase.

The lowest energy triplet state (T 1) of each species was formed by intersystem crossing from a laser-excited singlet state. Transient triplet-triplet absorption spectroscopy was then {{used to measure the}} decay kinetics of the triplet state. The data were analyzed using an expanded kinetic model of C 60 and C 70 triplet relaxation in solution. This model includes not only unimolecular T 1 → S 0 radiationless relaxation, but also three <b>bimolecular</b> <b>quenching</b> processes: triplet-triplet annihilation, oxygen quenching and self-quenching. Under experimental conditions that suppress these <b>bimolecular</b> <b>quenching</b> processes, the exponential lifetimes of T 1 are found to be 133 μ s for C 60 and > 2. 2 ms for C 70. Triplet C 60 and C 70 are self-quenched with rate constants of 1. 5 x 107 M- 1 s-l and 8. 5 x 107 M- 1 s-l, respectively. Triplet-triplet annihilation occurs with bimolecular rate constants of 5. 4 x 109 M-ls-l for C 60 and 1. 2 x 1010 M-ls-l for C 70. Mixed solutions of C 60 and C 70 are found to exhibit unusual kinetics. A kinetic model featuring efficient and reversible electronic excitation transfer between nearly isoenergetic triplet states is quantitatively successful in accounting for the observed behavior.

For Phen and CPhen where the energy gap between the first excited singlet and the nearest lower triplet state is small, an induced intersystem crossing was suggested. Finally, the quenching process was discussed in terms of the free energy dependence (ÃŽÂ”G) of the electron transfer from nitroxide radicals to the excited hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|Diethylamino-substituted oligophenylenevinylene (OPV) {{building}} blocks {{have been prepared}} and used for the synthesis of two [60]fullerene-OPV dyads, F-D 1 and F-D 2, which exhibit different conjugation length of the OPV fragments. The electrochemical properties of these acceptor-donor dyads have been studied by cyclic voltammetry. The first reduction is always assigned to the fullerene moiety and the first oxidation centered on the diethylaniline groups of the OPV rods, thus making these systems suitable candidates for photoinduced electron transfer. Both the OPV and the fullerene-centered fluorescence bands are quenched in toluene and benzonitrile, which suggests the occurrence of photoinduced electron transfer from the amino-substituted OPVs to the carbon sphere in the dyads in both solvents. By means of <b>bimolecular</b> <b>quenching</b> experiments, transient absorption spectral fingerprints of the radical cationic species are detected in the visible (670 nm) and near-IR (1300 - 1500 nm) regions, along with the much weaker fullerene anion band at max= 1030 nm. Definitive evidence for photoinduced electron transfer in F-D 1 and F-D 2 comes from transient absorption measurements. A charge-separated state is formed within 100 ps and decays in less than 5 ns...|$|R
40|$|In this {{investigation}} we report {{the synthesis of}} optically coupled hybrid architectures based on a new biomimetic fluorescent protein rec 1 -resilin and nanometer-scale gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in a one-step method using a non-covalent mode of binding protocol. The presence of uniformly distributed fluorophore sequences, –Ser(Thr) -Tyr-Gly- along the molecular structure of rec 1 -resilin provides signnificant opportunity to synthesize fluorophore-modified AuNPs bioconjugates with unique photophysical properties. The detailed analyses of the AuNP-bioconjugates, synthesized under different experimental conditions using spectroscopic, microscopic and scattering techniques demonstrate the organizational pathways and the electronic and photophysical properties of the developed AuNP-rec 1 -resilin bioconjugates. The calculation of the <b>bimolecular</b> <b>quenching</b> constant using the Stern–Volmer equation confirms that the dominant mechanism involved in quenching of fluorescence of rec 1 -resilin {{in the presence of}} AuNP is static. Photoacoustic infrared spectroscopy was employed {{to understand the nature of}} the interfacial interaction between the AuNP and rec 1 -resilin and its evolution with pH. In such bioconjugates the quenched emission of fluorescence by AuNP on the fluorophore moiety of rec 1 -resilin in the immediate vicinity of the AuNP has significant potential for fluorescence-based detection schemes, sensors and also can be incorporated into nanoparticle-based devices. ...|$|R

40|$|Conformational {{fluctuations}} of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides {{were studied}} {{in aqueous solution}} by monitoring contact-induced fluorescence quenching of the oxazine fluorophore MR 121 by intrinsic guanosine residues (dG). We applied fluorescence correlation spectroscopy as well as steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to analyze kinetics of DNA hairpin folding. We first characterized the reporter system by investigating <b>bimolecular</b> <b>quenching</b> interactions between MR 121 and guanosine monophosphate in aqueous solution estimating rate constants, efficiency and stability for formation of quenched complexes. We then studied the kinetics of complex formation between MR 121 and dG residues site-specifically incorporated in DNA hairpins. To uncover the initial steps of DNA hairpin folding we investigated complex formation in ssDNA carrying one or two complementary base pairs (dC–dG pairs) that could hybridize to form a short stem. Our data show that incorporation of a single dC–dG pair leads to non-exponential decays for opening and closing kinetics and reduces rate constants by one to two orders of magnitude. We found positive activation enthalpies independent {{of the number of}} dC–dG pairs. These results imply that the rate limiting step of DNA hairpin folding is not determined by loop dynamics, or by mismatches in the stem, but rather by interactions between stem and loop nucleotides...|$|R

40|$|Quenching of Trp {{phosphorescence}} in proteins by {{diffusion of}} solutes of various molecular sizes unveils the frequency-amplitude of structural fluctuations. To cover the sizes gap between O 2 and acrylamide, we examined the potential of acrylonitrile to probe conformational flexibility of proteins. The distance dependence of the through-space acrylonitrile quenching rate was determined in a glass at 77 K, with the indole analog 2 -(3 -indoyl) ethyl phenyl ketone. Intensity and decay kinetics data were fitted to a rate, k(r) = k 0 exp[−(r − r 0) /re], with an attenuation length re = 0. 03 nm and a contact rate k 0 = 3. 6 × 1010 s− 1. At ambient temperature, the <b>bimolecular</b> <b>quenching</b> rate constant (kq) was determined {{for a series of}} proteins, appositely selected to test the importance of factors such as the degree of Trp burial and structural rigidity. Relative to kq =  1. 9 × 109 M− 1 s− 1 for free Trp in water, in proteins kq ranged from 6. 5 × 106 M− 1 s− 1 for superficial sites to 1. 3 × 102  M− 1 s− 1 for deep cores. The short-range nature of the interaction and the direct correlation between kq and structural flexibility attest that in the microsecond-second timescale of phosphorescence acrylonitrile readily penetrates even compact protein cores and exhibits significant sensitivity to variations in dynamical structure of the globular fold...|$|R
