5|$|Balaenopterids are the rorquals. These animals, {{along with}} the cetotheriids, rely on their throat pleats to gulp large amounts of water while feeding.

Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure <b>small</b> <b>animals</b> to within striking distance of the fish.|$|E

5|$|Since the Cambrian {{explosion}} {{there have}} been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions.

5|$|As {{is typical}} for such <b>small</b> <b>animals,</b> {{there are no}} {{respiratory}} or circulatory organs. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one {{on either side of}} the pharynx, connected by a commissure. From these lead a pair of nerve cords which run along either side of the body beside the longitudinal muscle bands. The primary sensory organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface which function as mechanoreceptors. There are also ciliated pits on the head, simple ciliary photoreceptors and fleshy appendages which act as chemoreceptors.|$|E

Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe laxative effects on <b>small</b> <b>animals.</b> Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.|$|E
