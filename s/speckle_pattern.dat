2500|$|The <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern</b> {{which is}} seen when using a laser pointer is another {{diffraction}} phenomenon. It {{is a result}} of the superposition of many waves with different phases, which are produced when a laser beam illuminates a rough surface.

Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) of the measurement channels {{is achieved by}} recording <b>speckle</b> <b>patterns</b> from objects illuminated by intensity-modulated sources. Each source is modulated at a discrete frequency, which {{is less than half}} of the camera frame rate, and a bank of images of the modulated <b>speckle</b> <b>patterns</b> is captured.

The mutual coherence between the measuring matrix and the sparsifying dictionary matrix is minimized to obtain the required <b>speckle</b> <b>patterns.</b> Simulation and experimental results are presented, both showing {{that the quality of}} the reconstructed results obtaiiied with the optimized <b>speckle</b> <b>patterns</b> is much improved in comparison with that obtained with the general unoptimized ones.

2500|$|The {{effects of}} {{diffraction}} are {{often seen in}} everyday life. The most striking examples of diffraction are those that involve light; for example, the closely spaced tracks on a CD or DVD act as a diffraction grating to form the familiar rainbow pattern seen when looking at a disc. This principle can be extended to engineer a grating with a structure such that it will produce any diffraction pattern desired; the hologram on a credit card is an example. Diffraction in the atmosphere by small particles can cause a bright ring to be visible around a bright light source [...] like the sun or the moon. A shadow of a solid object, using light from a compact source, shows small fringes near its edges. The <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern</b> which is observed when laser light falls on an optically rough surface is also a diffraction phenomenon. [...] When deli meat appears to be iridescent, that is diffraction off the meat fibers. All these effects are {{a consequence of the}} fact that light propagates as a wave.|$|E

If the observer has perfect vision, {{the image of the}} surface is also formed on the retina, and movement of the head will result in the <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern</b> and the surface moving together so that the <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern</b> remains stationary with respect to the background.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that dynamic <b>speckle</b> <b>patterns</b> {{can be used to}} {{identify}} the temporal evolution of an active sample and some desired properties of the sample may therefore be detected via the dynamic laser speckle analysis. Mathematically understand the structure of sample surface which gives arise to the dynamic <b>speckle</b> <b>patterns</b> is crucial to the analysis. In this paper, a simulation model of the dynamic <b>speckle</b> <b>patterns</b> for plant leaves is proposed. The developed model is derived from the principle of coherent electromagnetic wave scattering off a randomly textured and time varying surface and is demonstrated via the simulation of dynamic <b>speckle</b> <b>patterns</b> of a fresh unattached leaf surface along the true laser speckle measurements. Both simulated and true measurements of the dynamic <b>speckle</b> <b>patterns</b> of the leaf are analyzed via several statistical techniques and a consistent agreement between the results of the two is observed. The proposed statistical model is helpful to gain the insight of the relationship between speckle dynamics and the activity of the leaf surface which is supposed to be an measurement of plant water stress and water status...|$|R

5000|$|When a {{rough surface}} which is {{illuminated}} by a coherent light (e.g. a laser beam) is imaged, a <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern</b> is {{observed in the}} image plane; {{this is called a}} “subjective speckle pattern” - see image above. It is called [...] "subjective" [...] because the detailed structure of the <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern</b> depends on the viewing system parameters; for instance, if the size of the lens aperture changes, the size of the speckles change. If the position of the imaging system is altered, the pattern will gradually change and will eventually be unrelated to the original <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E
5000|$|When {{laser light}} {{which has been}} {{scattered}} off a rough surface falls on another surface, it forms an “objective speckle pattern”. If a photographic plate or another 2-D optical sensor is located within the scattered light field without a lens, a <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern</b> is obtained whose characteristics depend on the geometry {{of the system and}} the wavelength of the laser. The <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern</b> in the figure was obtained by pointing a laser beam at the surface of a mobile phone so that the scattered light fell onto an adjacent wall. A photograph was then taken of the <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern</b> formed on the wall (strictly speaking, this also has a second subjective <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern</b> but its dimensions are much smaller than the objective pattern so it is not seen in the image) The light at a given point in the <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern</b> is made up of contributions from the whole of the scattering surface. The relative phases of these waves vary across the surface, so that the sum of the individual waves varies randomly. The pattern is the same regardless of how it is imaged, just {{as if it were a}} painted pattern.|$|E

The rough surface, and the dichromatic <b>speckle</b> <b>patterns,</b> and trichromatic <b>speckle</b> <b>patterns</b> are simulated, {{and the effects of}} different radius of curved surface on <b>speckle</b> <b>patterns</b> and <b>speckle</b> elongation ratio are discussed. The results show that the larger curvature radius is, the larger speckle elongation becomes, and the smaller the deviation of measured surface roughness is. Therefore, {{influence of}} curvature of rough surface on measurement precision should be taken into consideration during measuring process...|$|R

It is roughly equal to the inverse of the number of speckle (see <b>Speckle</b> <b>pattern)</b> from which light is collected.

5000|$|In {{the fields}} of {{cardiology}} and medical imaging, Speckle Tracking Echocardiography (STE) is an echocardiographic imaging technique that analyzes the motion of tissues in the heart by using the naturally occurring <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern</b> in the myocardium or blood when imaged by ultrasonic. This novel method of documentation of myocardial motion represents a noninvasive method of definition of vectors and velocity. When compared to other technologies seeking noninvasive definition of ischemia, speckle tracking seems a valuable endeavor. This <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern</b> {{is a mixture of}} interference patterns and natural acoustic reflections. These reflections are also described as ‘‘speckles’’ or ‘‘markers’’. The pattern being random, each region of the myocardium has a unique <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern</b> (also called ‘‘patterns’’, ‘‘features’’, or ‘‘fingerprints’’) that allows the region to be traced from one frame to the next, and this <b>speckle</b> <b>pattern</b> is relatively stable, at least from one frame to the next. In post processing this can be tracked consecutively frame to frame and ultimately resolved into angle-independent two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional strain-based sequences (3D) [...] These sequences provide both quantitative and qualitative information regarding tissue deformation and motion.|$|E
