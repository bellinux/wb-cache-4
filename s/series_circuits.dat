50|$|<b>Series</b> <b>circuits</b> were {{formerly}} {{used for}} lighting in electric multiple unit trains. For example, if the supply voltage was 600 volts {{there might be}} eight 70-volt bulbs in series (total 560 volts) plus a resistor to drop the remaining 40 volts. <b>Series</b> <b>circuits</b> for train lighting were superseded, first by motor-generators, then by solid state devices.|$|E
50|$|Incandescent lamps were {{primarily}} used for street lighting until {{the advent of}} high-intensity discharge lamps. They were often operated at high-voltage <b>series</b> <b>circuits.</b> <b>Series</b> <b>circuits</b> were popular since the higher voltage in these circuits produced more light per watt consumed. Furthermore, before the invention of photoelectric controls, a single switch or clock could control all the lights in an entire district.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>series</b> <b>circuit's</b> main {{disadvantage}} or advantage, {{depending on}} its intended {{role in a}} product's overall design, is that because {{there is only one}} path in which its current can flow, opening or breaking a <b>series</b> <b>circuit</b> at any point causes the entire circuit to [...] "open" [...] or stop operating. For example, if even one of the light bulbs in an older-style string of Christmas tree lights burns out or is removed, the entire string becomes inoperable until the bulb is replaced.|$|R

50|$|The {{contacts}} {{of one or}} more relays can be used {{to drive}} the coil of another relay. To make an OR gate for example, the contacts of several input relays may be placed in parallel circuits and used to drive the electromagnet of a third relay. This, along with <b>series</b> <b>circuits</b> and more complicated schemes such as multiply wound electromagnets, allows the creation of AND gates, OR gates and Inverters (using the normally closed contact on a relay). Using these simple circuits in combination with De Morgan's Laws, any combinational function can be created using relays.|$|E

40|$|Characteristics of {{variable}} threshold voltage CMOS (VTCMOS) in the <b>series</b> connected <b>circuits</b> are investigated {{by means of}} device simulation. It is newly found that the performance degradation due to the body effect in <b>series</b> connected <b>circuit</b> is suppressed by utilizing VTCMOS. Lowering the threshold voltage (Vth) enhances the drive current and alleviates the degradation due to the series connected configuration. Therefore, larger body effect factor (γ) results in lower Vth and higher on-current even in the <b>series</b> connected <b>circuits.</b> These characteristics are attributed to the velocity saturation phenomenon which reduces the drain saturation voltage (Vdsat).

5000|$|The MOSFETs are n-type {{enhancement}} mode transistors, {{arranged in a}} so-called [...] "pull-down network" [...] (PDN) between the logic gate output and negative supply voltage (typically the ground). A pull up (i.e. a [...] "load" [...] that {{can be thought of}} as a resistor, see below) is placed between the positive supply voltage and each logic gate output. Any logic gate, including the logical inverter, can then be implemented by designing a network of parallel and/or <b>series</b> <b>circuits,</b> such that if the desired output for a certain combination of boolean input values is zero (or false), the PDN will be active, meaning that at least one transistor is allowing a current path between the negative supply and the output. This causes a voltage drop over the load, and thus a low voltage at the output, representing the zero.|$|E

A pump recirculated up to 100,000 gallons per hour from the pool in the 120 ft basin. [...] The fountain also had 88 incandescent lamps on the inner edge of the basin's concrete coping, and the Brooklyn Heights and the Nassau Electric railroads donated the electricity.|$|E
