The throttle is usually a conventional carburetor as used on radio control models schemes that couple limited rudder and/or aileron, and variable leadout position are often found on carrier planes as well as elevator and flaps/Monoline control works by twisting the single line. The pilot holds a handle with a twisted flat piece of metal on bearings in one hand, and a [...] "bobbin" [...] in the other. Moving bobbin towards or away from the handle twists the line. Inside the airplane, the rotating line rotates a <b>spiral</b> <b>scroll</b> with a follower. The follower moves toward {{and away from the}} pivot of the scroll, and has a pushrod attached. Then, as the scroll rotates, the pushrod moves fore and aft. The rest of the system is like the two-line system. The control of a monoline system is much less precise than a two-line system because the line itself tends to twist up before it moves the scroll, leading to a somewhat vague control response with considerable lag. It does however have the advantage of not requiring as much line tension to move the controls, and the single line has less drag than the two slightly smaller lines used in conventional two-line control.|$|E

The {{shape of}} a hydro-electric (hydel) power station {{particularly}} the concrete around spiral case and generator foundation is so complex that the determination of actual stresses is very complicated and time-consuming process since it is essentially a three-dimensional problem. The stress variations in the structure have been studied using three-dimensional photoelastic method in few small scale models only. In the present study, finite element and boundary element analyses of <b>spiral</b> (<b>scroll)</b> case and generator foundation of a large hydel power station considering generator loads {{have been carried out}}. A simple and efficient method of slices for the geometric representation of the structure has been developed. Linear elastic analyses have been carried out using well established existing finite element and boundary element computer programs and two pre-processing computer programs have also been developed to support the 3 -D finite element program. Almost all of the present analyses show the same pattern of stresses and only their values differ, while most of the existing photoelastic study results indicate stresses with different pattern.

40|$|The {{beating of}} the heart is a {{synchronized}} contraction of muscle cells (myocytes) that are triggered by a periodic sequence of electrical waves (action potentials) originating in the sino-atrial node and propagating over the atria and the ventricles. Cardiac arrhythmias like atrial and ventricular fibrillation (AF,VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) are caused by disruptions and instabilities of these electrical excitations, {{that lead to the}} emergence of rotating waves (VT) and turbulent wave patterns (AF,VF).

50|$|The {{so-called}} Golden Horn ware was {{a variation}} on the blue-and-white decoration that was popular from the late 1520s to 1550s. Golden Horn ware was so named because sherds in this style were excavated in the Golden Horn area of Istanbul. It was later realized that the pottery was made in İznik as some motifs on the vessels closely resembled those used on other blue-and-white Iznik pottery. The decoration consists of a series of thin spirals adorned with small leaves. The narrow rims of dishes are painted with a meandering pattern. The design is similar to the illuminated <b>spiral</b> <b>scrolls</b> used as a background to Sultan Suleymans Tuğra, or imperial monogram. Julian Raby has used the term Tuğrakeş spiral ware as the tuğrakeş were the specialist calligraphers in the Ottoman court.

40|$|Abnormal {{electrical}} activity from {{the boundaries of}} ischemic cardiac tissue is {{recognized as one of}} the major causes in generation of ischemia-reperfusion arrhythmias. Here we present theoretical analysis of the waves of {{electrical activity}} that can rise on the boundary of cardiac cell network upon its recovery from ischaemia-like conditions. The main factors included in our analysis are macroscopic gradients of the cell-to-cell coupling and cell excitability and microscopic heterogeneity of individual cells. The interplay between these factors allows one to explain how spirals form, drift together with the moving boundary, get transiently pinned to local inhomogeneities, and finally penetrate into the bulk of the well-coupled tissue where they reach macroscopic scale. The asymptotic theory of the drift of <b>spiral</b> and <b>scroll</b> waves based on response functions provides explanation of the drifts involved in this mechanism, with the exception of effects due to the discreteness of cardiac tissue. In particular, this asymptotic theory allows an extrapolation of 2 D events into 3 D, which has shown that cells within the border zone can give rise to 3 D analogues of <b>spirals,</b> the <b>scroll</b> waves. When and if such scroll waves escape into a better coupled tissue, they are likely to collapse due to the positive filament tension.

40|$|Cardiac arrhythmias, such as {{ventricular}} tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), {{are among the}} leading causes {{of death in the}} industrialized world. These are associated with the formation of <b>spiral</b> and <b>scroll</b> waves of electrical activation in cardiac tissue; single <b>spiral</b> and <b>scroll</b> waves are believed to be associated with VT whereas their turbulent analogs are associated with VF. Thus, the study of these waves is an important biophysical problem. We present a systematic study of the combined effects of muscle-fiber rotation and inhomogeneities on scroll-wave dynamics in the TNNP (ten Tusscher Noble Noble Panfilov) model for human cardiac tissue. In particular, we use the three-dimensional TNNP model with fiber rotation and consider both conduction and ionic inhomogeneities. We find that, in addition to displaying a sensitive dependence on the positions, sizes, and types of inhomogeneities, scroll-wave dynamics also depends delicately upon the degree of fiber rotation. We find that the tendency of scroll waves to anchor to cylindrical conduction inhomogeneities increases with the radius of the inhomogeneity. Furthermore, the filament of the scroll wave can exhibit drift or meandering, transmural bending, twisting, and break-up. If the scroll-wave filament exhibits weak meandering, then there is a fine balance between the anchoring of this wave at the inhomogeneity and a disruption of wave-pinning by fiber rotation. If this filament displays strong meandering, then again the anchoring is suppressed by fiber rotation; also, the scroll wave can be eliminated from most of the layers only to be regenerated by a seed wave.

40|$|Regular {{electrical}} activation {{waves in}} cardiac tissue {{lead to the}} rhythmic contraction and expansion of the heart that ensures blood supply to the whole body. Irregularities in the propagation of these activation waves can result in cardiac arrhythmias, like ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), which are major causes {{of death in the}} industrialised world. Indeed there is growing consensus that <b>spiral</b> or <b>scroll</b> waves of electrical activation in cardiac tissue are associated with VT, whereas, when these waves break to yield spiral- or scroll-wave turbulence, VT develops into life-threatening VF: in the absence of medical intervention, this makes the heart incapable of pumping blood and a patient dies in roughly two-and-a-half minutes after the initiation of VF. Thus studies of spiral- and scroll-wave dynamics in cardiac tissue pose important challenges for in vivo and in vitro experimental studies and for in silico numerical studies of mathematical models for cardiac tissue. A major goal here is to develop low-amplitude defibrillation schemes for the elimination of VT and VF, especially in the presence of inhomogeneities that occur commonly in cardiac tissue. We present a detailed and systematic study of spiral- and scroll-wave turbulence and spatiotemporal chaos in four mathematical models for cardiac tissue, namely, the Panfilov, Luo-Rudy phase 1 (LRI), reduced Priebe-Beuckelmann (RPB) models, and the model of ten Tusscher, Noble, Noble, and Panfilov (TNNP).

Most of the inhabitants of Manchuria, except for the wild Jurchens, were at peace with China. Yet a suitable relationship between Ming China and their neighbors to the northeast had not been established. The guard system had scarcely reached into northern Manchuria, and the regulations for tribute and commerce were still relatively uniformed. The Yongle Emperor once again was responsible for devising the framework for Ming-Jurchen relations. He sought peace with the Jurchens and tried to prevent them from allying with the Mongols or the Koreans to pose threats to the Chinese borderlands. One way of winning over the Jurchens was to initiate a regular system of tribute and trade, a boon to these northeastern neighbors, {{as well as to the}} Ming, which needed and coveted certain Jurchen products. Finally, the emperor distinguished between Liaodong and the other Jurchen areas farther to the north.

40|$|Functional {{materials}} that are active at nanometer scales and adaptive to environment have been highly desirable for a huge array of novel applications ranging from photonics, sensing, fuel cells, smart materials to drug delivery and miniature robots. These bio-inspired features imply that the underlying structure {{of this type of}} materials should possess a well-defined ordering as well as the ability to reconfigure in response to a given external stimulus such as temperature, electric field, pH or light. In this thesis, we employ computer simulation as a design tool, demonstrating that various ordered and reconfigurable structures can be obtained from the self- and directed-assembly of soft matter nano-building blocks such as nanoparticles, polymer-tethered nanoparticles and colloidal particles. We show that, besides thermodynamic parameters, the self-assembly of these building blocks is governed by nanoparticle geometry, the number and attachment location of tethers, solvent selectivity, balance between attractive and repulsive forces, nanoparticle size polydispersity, and field strength. We demonstrate that higher-order nanostructures, i. e. those for which the correlation length is much greater than the length scale of individual assembling building blocks, can be hierarchically assembled. For instance, bilayer sheets formed by laterally tethered rods fold into <b>spiral</b> <b>scrolls</b> and helical structures, which are able to adopt different morphologies depending on the environmental condition. We find that a square grid structure formed by laterally tethered nanorods can be transformed into a bilayer sheet structure, and vice versa, upon shortening, or lengthening, the rod segments, respectively. From these inspiring results, we propose a general scheme by which shape-shifting particles are employed to induce the reconfiguration of pre-assembled structures. Finally, we investigate the role of an external field in assisting the formation of assembled structures that would not be accessible from self-assembly. As an example, we show the assembly of magnetic Janus particles with a highly ordered alignment and a tunable gradient density, which are likely to be applicable to photonic band gap materials. Our results and proposed methods serve not only as proofs of concept for designing functional nanostructured materials via "bottom-up" approaches, but also to inspire further theoretical and experimental investigations...|$|R
