In this work the main purpose is to know the mechanical behavior of a dissimilar weld between HSLA Steel and Superduplex Stainless Steel (SDSS) to establish if the joint is feasible or not. The alloys were welded with GTAW process using a 60 -deg and 90 -deg single-V groove test specimens in order to observe the effect of the weld pass.

Design/methodology/approach: In presented study duplex stainless steels were obtained through powder metallurgy starting from austenitic, ferritic base powders by controlled addition of alloying elements, such as Cr, Ni, Mo and Cu. In the studies apart from the preparation of mixes, <b>Schaeffler’s</b> <b>diagram</b> was taken into consideration. Prepared mixes have been compacted at 800 MPa and sintered in a vacuum furnace with argon backfilling at temperatures from 1200 °C to 1285 °C for 0. 5, 1 and 2 h. After sintering different cooling cycles were applied using nitrogen under pressure from 0. 6 MPa to 0. 002 MPa in argon atmosphere. Produced duplex stainless steels have been studied by scanning and optical microscopy and EDS chemical analysis of microstructure components. Findings: Obtained microstructure and mechanical properties of sintered duplex stainless steel strictly depend on the density and the pore morphology present in the microstructure and especially on cooling rate directly from sintering temperature in sinter-hardening process. The lowest cooling rate - applied gas pressure, the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance decrease due to precipitation of sigma phase. Proper bi-physic microstructure was obtained using nitrogen under pressure of 0. 6 and 0. 2 MPa.

40|$|Transition {{joints between}} {{austenitic}} stainless steels and ferritic low alloy steels are extensively utilized in many high-temperature applications in energy conversion systems. Problems related {{to the use of}} such dissimilar metal welds (DMWs) have long been recognized, because of premature failures often occurring during service, connected to thermal stresses generated at the weld interface and to metallurgical changes (carbon migration, carbide precipitation) observed after prolonged exposure to high temperature. This paper reports the results of an investigation on DMWs carried out on plates and tubes by a deep penetration laser beam welding (LBW) process, within the framework of researching innovative welding procedures to allow for a better control of metallurgical changes and a minimization of thermal stresses. The experimental work included metallographic observations, hardness tests, x-ray diffractometry and estimation of phases on melt zones. These data are compared with the ev aluation given by the <b>Schaeffler</b> <b>diagram.</b> The results show the possibility of obtaining chemical compositions and phases according to predictions.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of delta ferrite fraction {{was measured with}} the magnetic method in specimens of different stainless steel compositions cast by the investment casting (lost wax) process. Ferrite fraction measurements published in the literature for stainless steel cast samples {{were added to the}} present work data, enabling an extensive analysis about practical methods to calculate delta ferrite fractions in stainless steel castings. Nineteen different versions of practical methods were formed using Schaeffler, DeLong, and Siewert diagrams and the nickel and chromium equivalent indexes suggested by several authors. These methods were evaluated by a detailed statistical analysis, showing that the Siewert diagram, including its equivalent indexes and iso-ferrite lines, gives the lowest relative errors between calculated and measured delta ferrite fractions. Although originally created for stainless steel welds, this diagram gives relative errors lower than those for the current ASTM standard method (800 /A 800 M- 01), developed to predict ferrite fractions in stainless steel castings. Practical methods originated from a combination of different chromium/nickel equivalent indexes and the iso-ferrite lines from <b>Schaeffler</b> <b>diagram</b> give the lowest relative errors when compared with combinations using other iso-ferrite line diagrams. For the samples cast in the present work, an increase in cooling rate from 0. 78 to 2. 7 K/s caused a decrease in the delta ferrite fraction, but a statistical hypothesis test revealed that this effect is significant in only 50 % of the samples that have ferrite in their microstructures.

40|$|With {{advent of}} new {{stainless}} steels, {{a wider range}} of alloys must be considered in predicting ferrite BY D. L. OLSON ABSTRACT. Diagrams, such as the <b>Schaeffler</b> and DeLong <b>diagrams,</b> have been used to assist in the proper selec-tion and use of austenitic filler materials and to predict weld metal microstruc-tures and properties. These diagrams have been very successful in predicting the amount of delta ferrite in stainless steel weld metal. This paper is concerned with the predictability of austenitic weld metal microstructure and properties over a larger compositional range. There are two main different types of phase transformations associated with austenitic weld metal. Existing analytical methodology has been successful at pre-dicting quantitatively the nature of the liquid to delta ferrite transformation. But the austenite to martensite transforma-tion for high alloy weld metal needs to be better understood if welding consuma-bles for new high manganese ferrous alloys are to be developed to achieve optimum properties and service behav-ior. In this paper, new expressions are introduced to predict the martensite start room temperature composition or the martensite start temperature. Some of these high manganese ferrous alloys are the basis for the new "no chromium" stainless steel. Various available diagrams, which allow for the prediction of weld metal microstructure, will be given. New mathematical forms for expres-sions to predict weld metal phase stability and microstructure, based on solution thermodynamics and kinetics, will be introduced. These new expressional forms should allow for better predictabil-ity over a larger alloy range. The non-homogeneous (cored) nature of the weld metal composition will also be consid-ered. These new forms can allow funda-mental alloying and solid solution infor-mation to be obtained from the micro-structure or property correlations with the weld metal compositions...|$|R
40|$|This Master’s Thesis {{consists}} of two separate and independent studies: One metallurgical study and one industrial buying behaviour study. Both studies concern continuous casting rolls. Metallurgical Study: The first objective {{of this study was}} to investigate two continuous casting rolls, consisting of different steel tubes with different martensitic stainless steel weld overlays. The second objective was to evaluate the methods employed in the study. The weld overlaps are clearly the weakest points of the weld overlay. They are sensitive to corrosion attacks, mainly due to sensitisation. The delta ferrite present in the welded overlay of both rolls is a preferential site for the corrosion attacks and the delta ferrite content depends primarily on the chemical composition of the weld overlay. The welding temperature may also have some influence on the delta ferrite content, but this has not been observed in this study. Both rolls have similar surface hardness. Roll no. 2 has more generalized corrosion attacks than roll no. 1. This is due to a higher delta ferrite content in roll no. 2 than in roll no. 1. The methods employed during the study proved to be adequate. In any future study, on condition that the visual inspection, diameter measurements, ultrasonic testing and surface hardness measurements show that all positions on the roll are similar, it will be sufficient to cut a bead and overlap sample from only one position. The rolls were investigated using macro etching, optical microscopy, Vickers hardness testing, ultrasonic testing ICP-OES analysis of nickel and chromium content and carbon content analysis by wet chemical method. Delta ferrite content was also calculated theoretically using a <b>Schaeffler</b> – DeLong <b>diagram</b> and a semi-empirical model. Industrial Buying Behaviour Study: The aim of this study is to investigate the industrial buying behaviour in slab casting steelworks in Western Europe when buying roll-lines. Case studies have been conducted at four steelworks belonging to different companies. Data was collected through personal interviews with people from production, maintenance and purchasing department and intermediate level management. A test consisting of a smaller amount of rolls is always performed before buying any larger quantities of rolls. Even though the test order has relatively low economic value, compared to a full-scale order, it is during this process that the relationships are established between the buying and the selling company. Findings show that the industrial buying behaviour of steelworks in Western Europe agrees well with the theory in this field. The buying process follows the steps in the buygrid model with only a few exceptions. The decision-making power lays in the intermediate level management, even though approval is required from upper level management. The most important factors affecting the buying behaviour are the relationship between the buyer and the seller, service-life and life cycle cost of the roll-line. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
