5|$|The {{history of}} Highway3 dates back over 200 {{years to the}} {{pioneering}} settlement era of Upper Canada following the American Revolution and the resulting influx of United Empire Loyalists. Thomas Talbot, an influential scion who joined the British army {{at the age of}} 11, would challenge the government, the terrain, and the forces of nature to <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> his road be built. Due to his family legacy, Talbot worked through the ranks quickly and found himself a personal aide to John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. He returned to England after Simcoe fell ill, but vowed to return to the hinterland he had come to love.|$|E

40|$|Stit theory, {{based on}} the notion of an agent's {{capacity}} for seeing <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> something holds, provides a rich semantic framework for manipulating agent ability. Its potential for representing nested statements readily draws stit theory onto uncomfortable ground with syntactically well formed constructs where one agent <b>sees</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> another agent <b>sees</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> something holds. This is uncomfortable because in systems of simple reactive agent it involves compromising the agency of the other agent. We introduce an alternative reading for stit using the notion of influence and this does not result in compromised agency. After introducing influence we briefly outline some of its logical properties and discuss results of exploratory experiments...|$|R

25|$|The World Cup {{was also}} criticised by the BCCI for its format because India failed {{to move on}} from the group stage after losing two of their three matches. The BCCI later claimed it would <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the ICC alter its format for the 2011 Cricket World Cup.

The Prime Minister later criticised journalists for carrying out demonstrations and at other times praised them for raising awareness. In a widely repeated quote in connection with the case, she said the government could not protect everyone by posting a guard outside their bedrooms. She also told party members that more journalists were killed when her political opponents were in power.|$|E
25|$|Recto {{is not a}} good speaker, no. He will arouse no mob. But heaven {{help the}} one whose pretensions he chooses to demolish. His {{sentences}} march like ordered battalions against the inmost citadel of the man's arguments, and reduce them to rubble; meanwhile his reservations stand like armed sentries against the most silent approach and every attempt at encirclement by the adversary. The reduction to absurdity of Nacionalista senator Zulueta's conception of sound foreign policy was a shattering experience, the skill that goes into the cutting of a diamond went into the work of demolition. There was no slip of the hand, no flaw in the tool. All was delicately, perfectly done... Recto cannot defend the indefensible, but what can be defended, he will <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> it will not be taken.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} {{now that the}} present {{situation}} cannot be allowed to continue. It is evident also that the Stormont government {{is no longer in}} control of the situation. Indeed, the present situation is the inevitable outcome of the policies pursued for decades by successive Stormont governments. It is clear also that the Irish Government can no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse. It is obvious that the RUC is no longer accepted as an impartial police force. Neither would the employment of British troops be acceptable nor would they be likely to restore peaceful conditions, certainly not in the long term. The Irish Government have, therefore, requested the British Government to apply immediately to the United Nations for the urgent dispatch of a Peace-Keeping Force to the Six Counties of Northern Ireland and have instructed the Permanent Representative to the United Nations to inform the Secretary General of this request. We have also asked the British Government to <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> police attacks on the people of Derry should cease immediately.|$|E

500|$|George and May {{had five}} {{sons and a}} daughter.

[...] In reality, there is no direct source for the quotation and it is likely that George's parenting style was little different from that adopted by most people at the time.|$|E
500|$|Boston Bruins governor, Charles Adams {{had long}} disliked the {{defensive}} tactic of shooting the puck {{the length of}} the ice ("icing") to relieve pressure.

[...] True to his word, the Bruins iced the puck 87 times in a 0–0 tie at Madison Square Garden.

500|$|In Canada, public {{sentiment}} widely supported the players. Opinion polls {{taken in the}} aftermath of the brawl saw 87–92% of respondents supporting their actions. Don Cherry's passionate defence of the Canadian team led to a sharp increase in his popularity. Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard had special gold medals made up for the Canadian team. Ballard stated that [...] "I believe the Canadian boys deserve the gold medal and I'm going to <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> they get them. Imagine how these Russians engineered this whole thing over there just because they've got a lousy team and were scared to go home finishing in sixth place." ...|$|E
500|$|The last {{ordinary}} dictator {{was appointed}} in 202 BC. After 202 BC, extreme emergencies were addressed through {{the passage of}} the senatus consultum ultimum ("ultimate decree of the senate") which suspended civil government, and declared something analogous to martial law. It declared [...] "videant consules ne res publica detrimenti capiat" [...] ("let the consuls <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the state suffer no harm") which, in effect, vested the consuls with dictatorial powers. There were several reasons for this change. Up until 202 BC, dictators were often appointed to fight plebeian unrest. In 217 BC, a law was passed that gave the popular assemblies the right to nominate dictators. This, in effect, eliminated the monopoly that the aristocracy had over this power. In addition, a series of laws were passed, which placed additional checks on the power of the dictator.|$|E

The statement said, [...] "Kodnani was tremendously favoured by the then investigating agencies (before the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team took over). All care, at the cost of the duty of the investigating officer and even the interest of the victims, was taken to <b>see</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Kodnani's involvement does not come on the books. This, in fact, comes in the way to believe that Kodnani was ever a victim of any politics." ...|$|E
