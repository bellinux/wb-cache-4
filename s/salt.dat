5|$|Himalayan <b>salt</b> is Pakistan's {{best known}} rock <b>salt.</b> It {{is used for}} cooking, as bath <b>salt,</b> as brine and as a raw {{material}} for many industries, including a soda ash plant set up by AkzoNobel in 1940. <b>Salt</b> from Khewra mine {{is also used to}} make decorative items like lamps, vases, ashtrays and statues, which are exported to the United States, India and many European countries. The use of rock <b>salt</b> to make artistic and decorative items started during the Mughal era, when many craftsman made tableware and decorations from it. Warth introduced the use of a lathe to cut out art pieces from the rock <b>salt,</b> as he found it similar to gypsum in physical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{civil disobedience}} spread {{throughout}} India as millions broke the <b>salt</b> laws by making <b>salt</b> or buying illegal <b>salt.</b> <b>Salt</b> was sold illegally {{all over the}} coast of India. A pinch of <b>salt</b> made by Gandhi himself sold for 1,600 rupees (equivalent to $750 at the time). In reaction, the British government arrested over sixty thousand people {{by the end of}} the month.|$|E

50|$|Solid <b>salts</b> do not conduct electricity. However, liquid <b>salts</b> do. Moreover, {{solutions}} of <b>salts</b> also conduct electricity.|$|R
5|$|<b>Salt</b> {{has long}} held an {{important}} place in religion and culture. At {{the time of}} Brahmanic sacrifices, in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks {{at the time of}} the new moon, <b>salt</b> was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of <b>salt</b> and water and some people think this to be the origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith. In Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over <b>salt</b> and <b>salt</b> water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Salt</b> is {{considered}} to be a very auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. In Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of <b>salt</b> before a deity to signify their devotion and <b>salt</b> is sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. <b>Salt</b> is believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition, and when returning home from a funeral, a pinch of <b>salt</b> is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. In Shinto, <b>salt</b> is used for ritual purification of locations and people (harae, specifically shubatsu), and small piles of <b>salt</b> are placed in dishes by the entrance of establishments for the two-fold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Salt</b> {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea <b>salt</b> and freshly mined <b>salt</b> (much {{of which is}} sea <b>salt</b> from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined <b>salt</b> is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. <b>Salt</b> crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of <b>salt</b> is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, <b>salt</b> crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of <b>salt,</b> and the boiling point of saturated <b>salt</b> solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E
25|$|<b>Salts</b> of {{imidazole}} {{where the}} imidazole ring {{is in the}} cation are known as imidazolium <b>salts</b> (for example, imidazolium chloride). These <b>salts</b> are formed from the protonation or substitution at nitrogen of imidazole. These <b>salts</b> {{have been used as}} ionic liquids and precursors to stable carbenes. <b>Salts</b> where a deprotonated imidazole is an anion are also well known; these <b>salts</b> are known as imidazolates (for example, sodium imidazolate, NaC3H3N2).|$|R
50|$|The {{fermentation}} of salty foods (such as soy sauce, Chinese fermented beans, <b>salted</b> cod, <b>salted</b> anchovies, sauerkraut, etc.) {{often involves}} halobacteria, as either essential ingredients or accidental contaminants. One example is Chromohalobacter beijerinckii, found in <b>salted</b> beans preserved in brine and in <b>salted</b> herring. Tetragenococcus halophilus {{is found in}} <b>salted</b> anchovies and soy sauce.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{varieties}} of <b>salts.</b> <b>Salts</b> that hydrolyze to produce hydroxide ions when dissolved in water are alkali salts; those that hydrolyze to produce hydronium ions in water are acidic <b>salts.</b> Neutral <b>salts</b> are those <b>salts</b> that are neither acidic nor basic. Zwitterions contain an anionic centre and a cationic centre {{in the same}} molecule, but are {{not considered to be}} <b>salts.</b> Examples of zwitterions include amino acids, many metabolites, peptides, and proteins.|$|R
5|$|<b>Salt</b> is {{processed}} from <b>salt</b> mines, {{and by the}} evaporation of seawater (sea <b>salt)</b> and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine; <b>salt</b> is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products. Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of <b>salt,</b> only about 6% is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible <b>salt</b> is sold in forms such as sea <b>salt</b> and table <b>salt</b> which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, <b>salt</b> is present in many processed foods.|$|E
5|$|<b>Salt</b> {{may have}} been used for barter in {{connection}} with the obsidian trade in Anatolia in the Neolithic Era. Herodotus described <b>salt</b> trading routes across Libya back in the 5th century BC. In {{the early years of the}} Roman Empire, roads such as the Via Salaria were built for the transportation of <b>salt</b> from the <b>salt</b> pans of Ostia to the capital. <b>Salt</b> was included among funeral offerings found in ancient Egyptian tombs from the third millennium BC, as were salted birds, and <b>salt</b> fish. From about 2800 BC, the Egyptians began exporting <b>salt</b> fish to the Phoenicians in return for Lebanon cedar, glass, and the dye Tyrian purple; the Phoenicians traded Egyptian <b>salt</b> fish and <b>salt</b> from North Africa throughout their Mediterranean trade empire.|$|E
5|$|<b>Salt</b> mining: Ancient China {{was among}} the {{earliest}} civilizations {{in the world with}} cultivation and trade of <b>salt</b> mining. They first discovered natural gas when they excavated rock <b>salt</b> as the Chinese writer, poet, and politician Zhang Hua of the Jin Dynasty wrote in his book Bowuzhi how people in Zigong, Sichuan excavated natural gas and used it to boil a rock <b>salt</b> solution. The ancient Chinese gradually mastered and advanced the techniques of producing <b>salt.</b> <b>Salt</b> mining was an arduous task for the ancient Chinese, where they faced geographical and technological constraints. <b>Salt</b> was mainly extracted from the sea and <b>salt</b> works in the coastal areas in late imperial China equated to more than 80 percent of national production. In conjunction to this, the Chinese made use of natural crystallization of <b>salt</b> lakes and constructed some artificial evaporation basins close to the shores. In 1041, during the medieval Song dynasty, the Chinese drilled a well with a diameter {{about the size of a}} bowl and several dozen feet deep was drilled for <b>salt</b> production. In Southwestern China, natural <b>salt</b> deposits were mined with bores that could reach to a depth of more than 1000 meters but the yields of ground and <b>salt</b> were relatively low. As <b>salt</b> was a necessity of life for human civilization, <b>salt</b> mining played a pivotal role as one of the most important sources of Imperial Chinese government revenue and state development.|$|E

50|$|Some acid <b>salts</b> {{are used}} in baking. They are found in baking powders and are {{typically}} divided into low-temperature (or single-acting) and high-temperature (or double-acting) acid <b>salts.</b> Common low-temperature acid <b>salts</b> react at room temperature to produce a leavening effect. They include cream of tartar, calcium phosphate, and citrates. High-temperature acid <b>salts</b> produce a leavening effect during baking and are usually aluminium <b>salts</b> such as calcium aluminium phosphate. Some acid <b>salts</b> may {{also be found in}} non-dairy coffee creamers.|$|R
5|$|The Khewra <b>Salt</b> Mine is {{also known}} as Mayo <b>Salt</b> Mine, in honour of Lord Mayo, who visited it as Viceroy of India. The mine is a part of a <b>salt</b> range that {{originated}} about 800 million years ago, when evaporation of a shallow sea followed by geological movement formed a <b>salt</b> range that stretched for about 300 kilometers (185 miles).|$|E

5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, <b>salt</b> {{spreader}} or <b>salt</b> truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock <b>salt),</b> onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The <b>salt</b> is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E
50|$|Quaternary {{ammonium}} <b>salts</b> {{are used}} as disinfectants, surfactants, fabric softeners, and as antistatic agents (e.g. in shampoos). In liquid fabric softeners, the chloride <b>salts</b> are often used. In dryer anticling strips, the sulfate <b>salts</b> are often used. Spermicidal jellies also contain quaternary ammonium <b>salts.</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose of this {{research}} was to know formaldehyde content, pesticides (organochlorine and organofosfat), and molds on various type of dried <b>salted</b> fish.

5|$|After making <b>salt</b> at Dandi, Gandhi {{continued}} southward {{along the}} coast, producing <b>salt</b> and addressing meetings on the way. The Congress Party planned {{to stage a}} satyagraha at the Dharasana <b>Salt</b> Works, 25 miles south of Dandi. However, Gandhi was arrested on the midnight of 4–5 May 1930, {{just days before the}} planned action at Dharasana. The Dandi March and the ensuing Dharasana Satyagraha drew worldwide attention to the Indian independence movement through extensive newspaper and newsreel coverage. The satyagraha against the <b>salt</b> tax continued for almost a year, ending with Gandhi's release from jail and negotiations with Viceroy Lord Irwin at the Second Round Table Conference. Over 80,000 Indians were jailed {{as a result of the}} <b>Salt</b> Satyagraha. However, it failed to result in major concessions from the British.|$|E

5|$|Ballpark is a {{light rail}} station in the People's Freeway {{neighborhood}} of <b>Salt</b> Lake City, Utah, in the United States, served by all three lines of Utah Transit Authority's TRAX light rail system. The Blue Line provides service from Downtown <b>Salt</b> Lake City to Draper. The Red Line provides service from the University of Utah to the Daybreak Community of South Jordan. The Green Line provides service from the <b>Salt</b> Lake City International Airport to West Valley City (via Downtown <b>Salt</b> Lake City).|$|E
5|$|Ballpark is {{near the}} point where the <b>Salt</b> Lake and Utah {{interurban}} streetcar line crossed the first mainline built south from <b>Salt</b> Lake City (which has been known by many names, but is most associated with the Union Pacific Railroad). The TRAX tracks north of the station follow the old route of the <b>Salt</b> Lake and Utah, while the tracks south of the area follow those used by Union Pacific. The electrified spur track visible to the northwest of the current station is the northern continuation of the original Union Pacific mainline; only a few traces of the southern continuation of the <b>Salt</b> Lake and Utah line (which headed due southwest to the vicinity of UTA's Redwood Junction station before turning south) remain.|$|E
5|$|Bounded on each {{sides by}} {{military}} training grounds, the I-80 corridor is overflown by commercial airliners traveling west from <b>Salt</b> Lake City International Airport. The freeway veers north around the Cedar Mountains {{in a small}} gap {{between them and the}} Lakeside Mountains. Further east, the highway passes the Stansbury Mountains, which are located in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. After the mountain ranges, the freeway arrives at the southern shore of the Great <b>Salt</b> Lake and closely follows the shore towards the western suburbs of <b>Salt</b> Lake City. However, the historical routes from which the route of I-80 was derived were routed further from the lake, passing through the towns of Grantsville and Tooele before crossing a bottleneck between the Oquirrh Mountains and Stansbury Island in the Great <b>Salt</b> Lake. These communities are now served by SR-138 and SR-36 respectively.|$|E
50|$|The {{reactivity}} of pyrylium <b>salts</b> toward nucleophiles makes them useful materials for producing other compounds with stronger aromatic character.
