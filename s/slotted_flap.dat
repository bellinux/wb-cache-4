50|$|A {{gap between}} the flap and the wing forces high {{pressure}} air from below the wing over the flap helping the airflow remain attached to the flap, increasing lift compared to a split flap. Additionally, lift across the entire chord of the primary airfoil is greatly increased as the velocity of air leaving its trailing edge is raised, from the typical non-flap 80% of freestream, {{to that of the}} higher-speed, lower-pressure air flowing around {{the leading edge of the}} <b>slotted</b> <b>flap.</b> Any flap that allows air to pass between the wing and the flap is considered a <b>slotted</b> <b>flap.</b> The <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> was a result of research at Handley-Page, a variant of the slot that dates from the 1920s, but wasn't widely used until much later. Some flaps use multiple slots to further boost the effect.|$|E
5000|$|The {{body of the}} 488 {{has been}} {{designed}} to increase downforce by 50% over the 458 while reducing aerodynamic drag. A new front double splitter serves two functions: increasing radiator cooling by forcing air into them and also channeling the air over the underbody vortex generators to create ground effect without adding unwanted drag. A newly designed blown rear spoiler (actually a <b>slotted</b> <b>flap)</b> integrated into the rear decklid and bumper increases downforce without requiring a raised wing. The central [...] "Aero Pillar" [...] deflects air under the flat body of the car while two vents in the bonnet provide an exit for air from the dual intakes of the front bumper, further reducing air pressure over the front of the car.|$|E
5000|$|In a July 2016 review, Flying {{magazine}} writer Pia Bergqvist generally {{praised the}} aircraft, but found fault with the flap mechanism and resulting pitch changes with flap deployment. She wrote, [...] "One thing {{that takes a}} bit of getting used to is the flap mechanism. Flaps are adjusted with a large handle in the upper left corner of the cockpit. The location of the handle {{makes it easy to}} access, and each flap setting is in a notch to prevent slippage. To get the first flap in position, you have to push slightly forward before grabbing the trigger to release the latch. For the second and third notches, however, you need to pull back before the handle will release. It took a few approaches {{to get used to the}} opposite action. The new <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> design allows for air from the underside of the wing to flow over the flap surface. With the additional lift, the pitch increases a great deal with each flap setting. president Randy Lervold advised me to fly with some nose-down trim before adding flaps. Without using that technique, retrimming was definitely required after each notch to prevent going too slow." ...|$|E

A. 23012 airfoils equipped with center-section and tip-section flaps were tested. The results showed that the changes in lift and drag due to changes in flap span for both rectangular and tapered wings having partial-span <b>slotted</b> <b>flaps</b> were similar to those for corresponding wings having partial-span split or plain flaps. For the two wings tested, higher values of maximum lift were obtained with center-section <b>slotted</b> <b>flaps</b> than with tip-section <b>slotted</b> <b>flaps</b> of the same size. The highest values of lift-drag ratio at maximum lift for the rectangular wing were obtained with center-section flaps and, for the tapered wing, with tip-section flaps. Center-section flaps on the tapered wing gave higher values of drag at maximum lift than tip-section flaps; no great difference in drag at maximum lift was apparent for either center-section or tip-section <b>slotted</b> <b>flaps</b> on the rectangular wing...|$|R
50|$|To achieve long range, the {{aircraft}} {{was designed for}} efficient cruising with the engines at half power. This required careful streamlining, both for the shaping of the fuselage and also for careful surface finishing. Induced drag was reduced by {{the small size of}} the wings and their high wing loading of 32 lb/sq ft. This would otherwise make {{the aircraft}} difficult to handle, especially with a high landing speed, but this was countered by the new development of the Fairey-Youngman flap, eventually patented in 1941. These flaps were large, around 1/3rd of the wing chord. Their movement went in two phases, controlled by a linkage; firstly the flap lowered below the wing and approximately parallel, making the aircraft almost a sesquiplane. This gave improved lift, but with little extra drag, and was used for landing. The flaps could be extended further for landing, now rotating downwards to 30° as a <b>slotted</b> <b>flap.</b> With the use of flaps, wing loading was reduced to the equivalent of 25 lb/sq ft and also gave a gain in lift coefficient of around 31%. The Fairey-Youngman flap and its initial downward parallel movement was superseded for other aircraft by the Fowler flap, which too had an initial parallel movement, although rearward sliding. Fairey did use this flap design for other aircraft though, such as the Fairey Barracuda dive bomber, as the design could be modified to also tilt the extended flap upwards, acting as a dive brake.|$|E

The usual effect of power in increasing the directional stability was also shown. Deflection of the single <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> produced negative dihedral effect, but increased the directional stability. The effects of deflecting the double <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> were erratic and marked changes in both effective dihedral and directional stability occurred.

With both types of flap the decrease in the angle of attack, for maximum section lift coefficient, with flap deflection is large for the NACA 27 - 212 airfoil as compared with the NACA 23012 airfoil.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made in}} the LMAL 7 - by 10 -foot wind tunnel of a NACA 23021 airfoil with a double <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> having a chord 32 percent of the airfoil chord (0. 32 c) to determine the aerodynamic section characteristics with the flaps deflected at various positions. The effects of moving the fore flap and rear flap as a unit and of deflecting or removing the lower lip of the slot were also determined. Three positions were selected for the fore flap and at each position the maximum lift of the airfoil was obtained with the rear flap at the maximum deflection used at that fore-flap position. The section lift of the airfoil increased as the fore flap was extended and maximum lift was obtained with the fore flap deflected 30 deg in the most extended position. This arrangement provided a maximum section lift coefficient of 3. 31, which was higher than the value obtained with either a 0. 2566 c or a 0. 40 c single-slotted-flap arrangement and 0. 25 less than the value obtained with a 0. 4 c double-slotted-flap arrangement on the same airfoil. The values of the profile-drag coefficient obtained with the 0. 32 c double <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> were larger than those for the 0. 2566 c or 0. 40 c single slotted flaps for section lift coefficients between 1. 0 and approximately 2. 7. At all values of the section lift coefficient above 1. 0, the 0. 40 c double <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> had a lower profile drag than the 0. 32 c double <b>slotted</b> <b>flap.</b> At various values of the maximum section lift coefficient produced by various flap defections, the 0. 32 c double <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> gave negative section pitching-moment coefficients that were higher than those of other slotted flaps on the same airfoil. The 0. 32 c double <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> gave approximately the same maximum section lift coefficient as, but higher profile-drag coefficients over the entire lift range than, a similar arrangement of a 0. 30 c double <b>slotted</b> <b>flap</b> on an NACA 23012 airfoil...|$|E

40|$|This work {{introduces}} the work {{conducted in the}} EU JTI project ANOLOCO, which has aimed at an assessment of aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of several high-lift configurations of a regional aircraft.

The aerodynamic performance is assessed from steady state RANS calculations up to maximum lift. The aeroacoustic performance is based on hybrid RANS-LES calculations for flow-induced noise generation, and using acoustic analogy methods for far-field noise propagation. Three different analogy methods are evaluated and compared. The assessment shows that the configuration with a Krueger flap gives the best performance.
