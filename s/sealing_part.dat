40|$|The paper, part 1, has {{proposed}} a mathematical model of rotor motion for piston rod driving type bent axis type axial piston pump in order to study lubrication characteristics between rotor and spherical valve plate. The numerical calculations {{have been carried out}} under operating conditions and specifications. The calculation results have been compared with experimental ones given by previous papers. It is found that (1) the rotor moves to delivery area and its axis tilts to one with its rotation, (2) film thickness between the rotor and the spherical valve plate minimizes at inside <b>sealing</b> <b>part</b> and the center of fluctuation locates near neutral point of the delivery area, and (3) the minimum film thickness and friction moment are greatly influenced by rotational speed, viscosity and dimension of <b>sealing</b> <b>part</b> on the spherical valve plate...|$|E
40|$|From experiments, {{it appears}} to be {{possible}} to stimulate a neuron by depolarisation of the lower membrane patch, the <b>sealing</b> <b>part</b> of the membrane, using a nano-ampere current through the extracellular electrode. Also, a stimulation window is observed. These findings can be explained by a finite element model of the neuron-electrode interface which permits geometry based dynamic modeling of the neuron-electrode interface and can be used to explore the requirements for lower membrane stimulation in more detail. An intracellular action potential develops if the current through the lower membrane is able to depolarize the upper membrane sufficiently...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Extracellular {{stimulation}} of single cultured neurons which are completely sealing a microelectrode is usually performed using anodic or biphasic currents {{of at least}} 200 nA. However, re-cently obtained experimental data demonstrate the possibility to stimulate a neuron using cathodic current pulses with less ampli-tude. Also, a stimulation window is observed. These findings {{can be explained by}} a finite-element model which permits geometry-based electrical representation of the neuron–electrode interface and can be used to explore the required conditions for extracellular stimu-lation in detail.

30|$|This paper aims to develop, {{demonstrate}} and validate {{an optimal}} design method of SPMC with the sealing performance. Based on the sealing structure of SPMC and static metal sealing mechanism, the critical condition of static metal seal is established for SPMC. On {{the base of}} superposition theorem of elasticity and compression experiment of the pipeline material, the minimum mean contact pressure of 8.625 inch SPMC is calculated. The parametric model of SPMC is created in APDL for optimization, with structure parameters of the <b>sealing</b> <b>part</b> as design variables, mean contact pressures and plastic strains on two sealing surfaces and variance of contact pressure on the second sealing surface as constrained variables, and minimum variance of contact pressure on the first sealing surface as objective function. The optimization is conducted by the zero-order method in ANSYS and water pressure experiments and bending experiments are carried out.|$|E
40|$|Although forces {{outside our}} control shape our industry, {{turbomachine}} sealing research, design, and customer agendas established in 1978 by Ludwig, Campbell, and Smith {{in terms of}} specific fuel consumption and performance remain as objectives today. Advances have been made because failures {{of the space shuttle}} main engine turbomachinery ushered in a new understanding of sealing in high-power-density systems. Further, {{it has been shown that}} changes in sealing, especially for high-pressure rotors, dramatically change the performance of the entire engine or turbomachine. Maintaining seal leakages and secondary flows within engine design specifications remains the most efficient and cost effective way to enhance performance and minimize maintenance costs. This three-part review summarizes experiences, ideas, successes, and failures by NASA and the U. S. aerospace industry in secondary flow management in advanced turbomachinery.
