40|$|A {{conventional}} {{argument in}} the child-labor debate is that improvements in access to schools are {{an effective way to}} reduce the labor force participation of children. It is argued that schooling competes with economic activity in the use of children's time, and enhanced access to schools, interpretable as reduction in <b>schooling</b> <b>costs,</b> may raise school attendance at the expense of child labor. In this paper, we draw a distinction between child labor within the household (intra-household) and child work in the labor market (extra-household), and examine the separate effects of <b>schooling</b> <b>costs</b> on the two types of child labor. Consistent, at least in part, with our theoretical framework, we find that extra-household child labor and <b>schooling</b> <b>costs</b> are positively related while intra-household child labor is insensitive to changes in the costs of schooling. Our results suggest that reduction in <b>schooling</b> <b>costs</b> will have limited success in the abatement of child labor in rural Pakistan. Labor and Human Capital,...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} held that work by {{children}} obstructs schooling, so that working children in impoverished families {{will find it}} difficult to escape poverty. If children's school attendance and work were highly substitutable activities, it would be advisable to quell work in the interest of schooling and, if less child work were desirable for its own sake, to boost school attendance so as to reduce child work. Hence, this article examines the effects of <b>schooling</b> <b>costs</b> upon both children's propensities to work and to attend school in rural northern India in a bid to assess the extent of trade-off between the activities. Analyses of data from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, two Northern Indian states, reveal a positive relation between child work and <b>schooling</b> <b>costs,</b> a negative relation between school enrollment and <b>schooling</b> <b>costs,</b> and that the decrease in the probability of child work from a decrease in <b>schooling</b> <b>costs</b> is comparable in magnitude to the corresponding increase in the probability of school enrollment, implying children's work and school attendance are strongly substitutable activities. Thus, unlike recent studies of child work in India's South Asian neighbors of Bangladesh and Pakistan, this paper uncovers evidence of substantial trade-off between child work and school attendance...|$|E

40|$|Could {{a partial}} subsidy for child {{education}} increase children's participation in paid work? In contrast {{to much of}} the theoretical and empirical child labor literature, this paper shows that child work and school participation can be complements under certain conditions. Using data from the randomized evaluation of a conditional cash transfer program in the Philippines, the analysis finds that some children, who were in neither school nor work before the program, increased participation in school and work-for-pay after the program. Earlier cash transfer programs, notably those in Mexico, Brazil, and Ecuador, increased school attendance while reducing child labor. Those programs fully offset <b>schooling</b> <b>costs,</b> while the transfers under the Philippine transfers fall short of the full costs of schooling for a typical child. As a result, some beneficiary children from poor Philippine households increased work to support their schooling. The additional earnings from this work represent a substantive share of the shortfall in the <b>schooling</b> <b>costs</b> net of transfer. The paper rules out several potential alternative explanations for the increase in child labor, including changes in household productive activities, adult labor supply, and household expenditure patterns that, in principle, can arise after a cash transfer and may also affect the supply of or demand for child labor...|$|E

The model demonstrates that the child wage rate, which is also the opportunity cost of schooling, is a crucial determinant of total fertility. An increase in the child wage rate leads to lower schooling investments and higher fertility levels. However, changes in <b>schooling</b> <b>costs</b> have no impact on fertility decisions.

40|$|In recent {{time there}} has been a great concern about the rising <b>schooling</b> <b>costs</b> and rates of {{absenteeism}} and dropout among ward secondary school students. The objective {{of this study was to}} trace the increase in costs of schooling for the last five years, proportion of pupils dropping out due to costs of schooling, and examining the relationship between parental level of education, income and students dropout rates. The study employed quantitative research method in collecting and analyzing data where, documentary review guides were used to 9 heads of schools, 18 class teachers, 3 ward educational officers and 36 students as key informants of the study, from 9 sampled ward secondary schools in Morogoro Urban District. Findings revealed that, there was an increase in school expenses for an average of 51 percent from 2008 to 2012. Also, the proportion of pupils’ dropout rates due to costs of schooling accounted for 24 percent as a second reason, preceded by truancy (48. 8 percent) which is also quite conceivable to be contributed by students’ inability to meet costs of schooling. Moreover, 55 percent and 63 percent of dropout students had fathers and mothers with only primary level of education respectively. Furthermore, 73. 6 percent of dropout students had parents with poor income. This indicates that, many students quit schooling due to their poor family socioeconomic background. The study recommends to government to eliminate all unnecessary <b>schooling</b> <b>costs</b> so as to ensure maximum students’ accessibility and completion rates at secondary level of education especially to students from poor families...|$|E
40|$|Summary This paper {{considers}} {{evidence for}} the effects of policies on gender gaps in education, distinguishing between policies that are ostensibly gender neutral and those that explicitly target girls. The demand for girls' schooling is often more responsive than boys' to gender neutral changes in school distance, price, and quality, patterns which can be explained in a human capital investment model through assumptions about girls' and boys' <b>schooling</b> <b>costs</b> and returns. Among policies that target girls' enrollments, price incentives to households or schools and the provision of female teachers appear to be effective. Other interventions hold promise but have not been the subject of rigorous evaluation, pointing to an important agenda for future research. education gender human capital investments...|$|E
