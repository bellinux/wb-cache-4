Conservation trusts often, but not always, target lands adjacent to or within existing protected areas. However, land areas that are particularly valuable in terms of natural or cultural resources or are home to endangered plant or wildlife are good candidates for receiving protection efforts.|$|R
30|$|Currently, we {{are trying}} to assess whether current habitat {{conservation}} plans (HCPs) in southern California provide long-term protection to covered species, as well as preserve ecosystem function. Federal and state laws require that HCPs be implemented within an adaptive management framework. This framework represents an iterative approach, where an information feedback loop between monitoring and management improves understanding of species dynamics and ecological systems (Atkinson et al. 2004). The future scenario of increased wildfires should be incorporated into this framework (Regan et al. 2008). This will likely require creativity in implementing fire minimization measures, creating fire-safe refugia in <b>natural</b> <b>areas,</b> and working with local and state firefighting agencies to include plans for defense of <b>sensitive</b> <b>natural</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R

40|$|Wherever human {{land use}} is located near <b>sensitive</b> <b>natural</b> <b>areas,</b> such as wetlands, it has {{significant}} impacts on biodiversity in those areas. Both species richness and species composition are affected. As biodiversity is lost, conservation efforts increase {{and act as}} a constraint on land use options. Given these links, land use is a central factor in an ecological-economic analysis of biodiversity.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{findings}} of a study examining tourism operators 2 ̆ 7 responses to environmental regulation. Using evidence from five case studies in Eastern Australia, we assess how the three variables of the perceptions of environmental regulation, the perceptions of the regulatory agency, and the relationship between the operators and the regulators, can affect the responses of operators in <b>sensitive</b> <b>natural</b> <b>areas.</b> Our findings extend current literature on environmental regulation and highlight how operators 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of environmental regulation significantly influence their responses to regulation. The paper illustrates the need to understand the regulatory relationship from the perspectives of both regulators and tourism operators. It concludes by addressing the practical issue of improving the regulatory relationship and the broader question of the human side of environmental regulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} article proposes {{an assessment}} of the use of the « Espaces Naturels Sensibles » (<b>Sensitive</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Areas)</b> or ENS programme within the five “départements” (counties) of the region “Pays de la Loire”. We started from the observation of an unequal and diversified use of the programme among counties. That disparity reveals large differences in the appropriation of ENS concerning the aims (whether legal or administrative) as well as the stakeholders/users. We were able to put forwards a common feature {{in the evolution of the}} criteria for the selection of ENS sites : the growing importance of ecological criteria. This tendency illustrates the drift from identifying emblematic sites – natural, scenic, cultural or historical sites – as heritage to identifying biodiversity in an area as heritage. The two tests sites’ analysis (Maine-et-Loire and Loire-Atlantique), and in particular of their mediation mechanisms, will be the opportunity of illustrating this new tendency, but more importantly, of highlighting a relevant change in values for the use of these areas. We will then be able to refine our understanding of how the identification of nature as heritage works...|$|R
40|$|The {{conservation}} and management of wildlife species is contingent on estimating distribution and abundance. Sampling of wildlife requires repeated visits to accurately determine species occurrence and to quantify abundance across temporal and spatial scales. The use of trails to sample wildlife populations is increasing and offers opportunities to potentially sample more frequently, with increased ease of access, and less disturbance to habitats, which can be important in <b>sensitive</b> <b>natural</b> <b>areas.</b> We examined capture dataof terrestrial salamanders within Great Smoky Mountains National Park to determine if detection and abundance estimates from trail and non-trail transects were significantly different. Across two, 3 -week periods during June and July 2012, we sampled 195 transects (70 along trails and 125 within non-trail habitat) on multiple occasions. We found that most microhabitat variables associated with salamander detection and abundance did not differ between trail and non-trail transects. Further, our models indicate detection and abundance of terrestrial salamanders {{were not significantly different}} on trail and non-trail transects. These results suggest trails can be used to accurately estimate abundance of terrestrial salamanders and may reduce the need to sample for plethodontid salamanders in sensitive habitat...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} use of {{mosquito}} traps {{as an alternative to}} spraying insecticide in Camargue (France) following the significant impacts observed on the non-target fauna through Bti persistence and trophic perturbations. In a village of 600 inhabitants, 16 Techno Bam traps emitting CO 2 and using octenol lures were set from April to November 2016. Trap performance was estimated at 70 % overall based on mosquitoes landing on human bait in areas with and without traps. The reduction of Ochlerotatus caspius and Oc. detritus, the two species targeted by Bti spraying, was, respectively, 74 % and 98 %. Traps were less efficient against Anopheles hyrcanus (46 %), which was more attracted by lactic acid than octenol lures based on previous tests. Nearly 300, 000 mosquitoes from nine species were captured, with large variations among traps, emphasizing that trap performance is also influenced by surrounding factors. Environmental impact, based on the proportion of non-target insects captured, was mostly limited to small chironomids attracted by street lights. The breeding success of a house martin colony was not significantly affected by trap use, in contrast to Bti spraying. Our experiment confirms that the deployment of mosquito traps can offer a cost-effective alternative to Bti spraying for protecting local populations from mosquito nuisance in <b>sensitive</b> <b>natural</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{tropical forest}} landscape change and deforestation trends in Nigeria. Emphasis’ {{are on the}} issues, the environmental analysis of the trends, factors influencing it, and community agroforestry efforts. The time frame and setting for the study runs through the west African nation of Nigeria during the periods of 1976 through 2005 at the national and state levels. In fact, Nigeria was once covered by widespread vegetation comprising of humid tropical forests {{in the south and}} savannah grasslands in the north rich in biodiversity. A great percentage of this luxurious vegetation has been cleared by the pressures mounted by human activities with eventual degradation. In terms of methods, the paper uses mixscale approach based on descriptive statistics, temporal spatial analysis and mapping, and photographic images to analyze the trends associated with tropical deforestation. The results show visible changes in the form of large scale decline of Nigeria’s forest landscape over the years. This resulted in the disappearance of forest resources and vegetation cover with mounting threats to <b>sensitive</b> <b>natural</b> <b>areas.</b> Aside from the socio-economic elements linked with the problem, community efforts at the margin using agroforestry systems showed some promise with many benefits to stem the tide of deforestation. To remedy the problems, the paper offered some recommendations ranging from policy overhaul to education...|$|R
40|$|Emission {{of ammonia}} (NH 3) from animal husbandry, and {{specially}} from the dairy sector, contributes significantly to acidification and eutrophication, and affects <b>sensitive</b> <b>natural</b> <b>areas.</b> In the nineties Monteny (1998) introduced a mechanistic model {{to understand and}} predict the NH 3 emissions from cubicle dairy cow houses. Although a limited sensitivity analysis was carried out, we still lack information that essential for further development of the model. Our aim is that the model can predict and assess the NH 3 emission from dairy cow houses under practical circumstance. The objective {{of this research was}} 1) to determine the relevance and irrelevance of a limited set of input factors, and 2) assess options for further development of the model for use in practice. A full factorial sensitivity analysis was carried out for eight variables related to NH 3 emission from a urine puddle on the floor. Relative importance and R 2 of the regression model factors were determined. The NH 3 emission varied strongly with both high and low emissions. Strongly contributing process variables were puddle pH, initial urea concentration, urination frequency, puddle depth and puddle area. We conclude that deviations in these influencing variables lead to large fluctuations in the NH 3 emission, which means that precise quantification of these variables in practice is essential for accurate predictions. Moreover, the results also show that the model may be over-parameterized, having several inputs that seem hardly relevant for the level of NH 3 emission...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{disasters}} have {{an effect}} on many important economic and social parameters, which are related to a wide spectrum of geosciences. The complexity of natural disasters concerning each of the five phases in their lifecycle (prevention, mitigation, preparedness, emergency management, recovery) leads to the selection of strong and capable tools, which contribute towards their management. Nowadays the most appropriate tools for this purpose are the Web-based Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Such a system, named SyNaRMa (Information System for Natural Risk Management in the Mediterranean) is being presented in this paper. SyNaRMa features include collection and analysis of many categories of data related to earthquake, landslide and forest fire, simulation of natural disaster effects resulting from realistic scenarios and prediction of their impact on the urban and/or natural environment on given pilot areas. Furthermore, it contains an effective database tool for recording and evaluating the actual damage of buildings due to a disaster. Overall, the system targets to the management of natural disasters, with an emphasis on the preparedness, response and recovery phase. The system structure is described through the following entities: 1. Event, defined as an independent natural disaster occurrence; 2. Damage, defined as the effect of an event on the built and natural environment; 3. Hazard sites, defined as sites with high probability of causing a dangerous event at a certain time and area; 4. Vulnerable sites, which may be either <b>sensitive</b> <b>natural</b> <b>areas</b> or human constructions that could possibly be affected {{in the case of an}} event; 5. Preparedness, where the user may access the scenario layers (maps) in combination with active events and damage using the GIS tools and 6.

40|$|In June of 2011, Florida Governor Rick Scott {{signed into}} law a piece of legislation, HB 7207, that {{severely}} curtailed the landmark Growth Management Act of 1985 (GMA), which through a policy combining consistency, concurrency, and compact development, had aimed to ensure the proper balancing of development and growth controls to promote socially responsible growth in the state {{for years to come}} (Pittman 2011). With his signature, Gov. Scott rendered toothless a piece of growth management legislation which had pioneered state growth efforts (along with the Oregon Land Use Act of 1973) and served as a model for numerous other states seeking to limit the deleterious environmental and social impacts of urban sprawl and wasteful land consumption and eliminated the agency, the Department of Community Affairs (DCA), that oversaw its implementation (Pittman 2011; Ben-Zadok 2005, 2167). While much has been written debating the GMA’s effectiveness in managing growth, its potential impact on housing affordability, and its broader impacts of Florida’s economic competitiveness, at this critical juncture in Florida’s history, it is appropriate to reflect upon the preceding four decades of planning for growth in the state. The act broadly sought to protect agricultural lands, environmentally <b>sensitive</b> lands, and <b>natural</b> <b>areas</b> from the pressures of development, instead directing growth to locations of higher density, thought more suitable to the long-term objectives of the public welfare. An added benefit of these efforts, of course, was the protection of taxpayers from financial strains of sprawling infrastructure...|$|R
