25|$|Human {{diseases}} {{transmitted by}} microtine rodents include cystic hydatid disease, tularemia, bubonic plague, babesiosis, giardiasis and the Lyme disease <b>spirochete</b> Borrelia burgdorferi.|$|E
25|$|B. burgdorferi is {{injected}} into the skin by the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. Tick saliva, which accompanies the <b>spirochete</b> into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response {{at the site of}} the bite. This provides a protective environment where the <b>spirochete</b> can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the dermis. The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion. Neutrophils, however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in the developing EM lesion. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body.|$|E
25|$|While Lyme spirochetes {{have been}} found in insects, as well as ticks, reports of actual {{infectious}} transmission appear to be rare. Lyme <b>spirochete</b> DNA has been found in semen and breast milk, but transmission has not been known to take place through sexual contact.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether relapsing fever-like <b>spirochetes</b> associated with hard ticks may infect Ixodes ricinus ticks in central Europe, we screened questing ticks for 16 S rDNA {{similar to that}} of Asian and American relapsing fever-like <b>spirochetes.</b> We compared the prevalence of these <b>spirochetes</b> to that of Lyme disease <b>spirochetes</b> transmitted by the same vector. Relapsing fever-like <b>spirochetes</b> infect 3. 5 % of questing vector ticks in our three central European sites near the Rhein Valley. These <b>spirochetes</b> differ genetically from their American and Asian analogs while being relatively homogeneous in the region we sampled. The Lyme disease genospecies most commonly detected in central Europe are distributed broadly, whereas those that are less frequently found appear to be place-specific. The absence of co-infected ticks suggests that relapsing fever-like and Lyme disease <b>spirochetes</b> may not share hosts. Exposure risk for relapsing fever-like <b>spirochetes</b> is {{similar to that of}} certain Lyme disease genospecies. Although many persons may be bitten by ticks infected by relapsing fever-like <b>spirochetes,</b> health implications remain unknown...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether and which <b>spirochetes</b> are cleared from Ixodes ricinus ticks during feeding on ruminants, ticks {{were removed from}} goats and cattle grazing on tick-infested pastures. Although {{about a quarter of}} ticks questing on the pasture were infected by <b>spirochetes,</b> no molted ticks that had previously engorged to repletion on ruminants harbored Lyme disease <b>spirochetes.</b> Borrelia miyamotoi <b>spirochetes,</b> however, appear not to be eliminated. Thus, the more subadult ticks are diverted from reservoir-competent hosts to zooprophylactic ruminants, the smaller the risk of infection by Lyme disease <b>spirochetes</b> is...|$|R
40|$|Humoral {{antibodies}} and {{in vitro}} blastogenic responses {{of patients with}} moderate to advanced periodontitis and of orally healthy (control) individuals to 11 <b>spirochetes</b> were assayed. Eight isolates of Treponema denticola, two isolates of T. vincentii, and one isolate of T. phagedenis were grown anaerobically, sonicated, and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. The blastogenic responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes were measured by [3 H]-thymidine uptake. Antibody titers (immunoglobulins A, G, and M) to the <b>spirochetes</b> were measured with the micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Dark-field microscopic enumeration of <b>spirochetes</b> was made from subgingival plaque. <b>Spirochetes</b> comprised 20 % {{of the total number}} of microorganisms seen in plaque from the patients, whereas no <b>spirochetes</b> were seen in plaque from the controls. The blastogenic responses to the <b>spirochetes</b> were not statistically different (P greater than 0. 05) between patients and controls. The immunoglobulin G and M antibody titers of the patients were generally lower than the titers of the controls, but the differences were rarely statistically significant. In contrast, the patients possessed significantly higher immunoglobulin A titers to seven <b>spirochetes</b> (T. denticola). No correlation was found between the percentage of <b>spirochetes</b> in the plaque sample and the blastogenic responses or titers of antibodies from an individual to the 11 <b>spirochetes...</b>|$|R
25|$|Leptospirosis causes similar {{symptoms}} {{and is also}} carried by rodent vectors, but it {{is due to a}} bacterial <b>spirochete</b> rather than a virus. Presumptive treatment of leptospirosis with penicillin (and other) antibiotics is often started for severe symptoms when a diagnostic dilemma between the two diseases is encountered.|$|E
25|$|B. burgdorferi {{can spread}} {{throughout}} the body {{during the course of}} the disease, and has been found in the skin, heart, joints, peripheral nervous system, and central nervous system. Many of the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are a consequence of the immune response to the <b>spirochete</b> in those tissues.|$|E
25|$|Days to weeks {{following}} the tick bite, the spirochetes spread via the bloodstream to joints, heart, nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence {{gives rise to}} the variety of symptoms of the disseminated disease. The spread of B. burgdorferi is aided by the attachment of the host protease plasmin {{to the surface of the}} <b>spirochete.</b>|$|E
40|$|Do <b>spirochetes</b> contain microtubules or filaments? The {{source of}} <b>spirochetes</b> is a termite colony {{in the lab}} of Lynn Margulis at Boston University. Lynn Margulis speaks on the {{necessity}} of cytoskeleton in chromosomal division. If microtubules came from <b>spirochetes</b> then mitosis may have developed by symbiosis...|$|R
40|$|Of 33 rabbits inoculated with Lyme disease <b>spirochetes,</b> two {{developed}} erythema chronicum migrans at {{the site}} of inoculation. <b>Spirochetes</b> were seen in skin biopsies of one of the lesions with immunoperoxidase and Warthin-Starry stains. <b>Spirochetes</b> were also recovered from the blood of two additional rabbits two weeks post-inoculation. These findings are characteristic of early Lyme disease in humans...|$|R
40|$|A direct {{fluorescent}} antibody test was developed for the identification of large <b>spirochetes</b> which {{are considered to be}} the cause of swine dysentery. Sera from swine which had recovered from swine dysentery and had been hyperimmunized by the intravenous and intraperitoneal injection of filtered <b>spirochetes</b> were used for conjugation with fluorescein isothiocyanate. A bright greenish fluorescence of large <b>spirochetes</b> was observed with the conjugated serum from hyperimmunized pig No. 1 when diluted 1 : 8 and hyperimmunized pig No. 2 when diluted 1 : 2. Pig No. 1 had developed a serum titer of 1 : 64 using the indirect {{fluorescent antibody}} test for large <b>spirochetes.</b> The conjugated serum from the three swine which had recovered from swine dysentery fluoresced <b>spirochetes</b> only when undiluted. The conjugated serum from the two swine treated while having a hemorrhagic diarrhea did not fluoresce <b>spirochetes.</b> No immunofluorescence of Vibrio spp. was observed...|$|R
25|$|Except for {{one study}} in Europe, {{much of the}} data implicating lizards is based on DNA {{detection}} of the <b>spirochete</b> and has not demonstrated lizards are able to infect ticks feeding upon them. As some experiments suggest lizards are refractory to infection with Borrelia, it appears likely their involvement in the enzootic cycle is more complex and species-specific.|$|E
25|$|Inside {{the cell}} is the cytoplasmic region that {{contains}} the genome (DNA), ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions. The genetic material is freely found in the cytoplasm. Prokaryotes can carry extrachromosomal DNA elements called plasmids, which are usually circular. Linear bacterial plasmids {{have been identified in}} several species of <b>spirochete</b> bacteria, including members of the genus Borrelia notably Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. Though not forming a nucleus, the DNA is condensed in a nucleoid. Plasmids encode additional genes, such as antibiotic resistance genes.|$|E

40|$|Outer surface protein A (OspA), {{which is}} abundantly {{expressed}} in cultured Borrelia burgdorferi, {{appears to be}} down-regulated or masked following low-dose infection, and OspA immunization did not prevent infection, dissemination, or disease development with host-adapted <b>spirochetes.</b> Seroconversion of mice to B. burgdorferi OspA depended on dose and viability of inoculated <b>spirochetes.</b> Mice inoculated with > 10 (4) live <b>spirochetes</b> and > 10 (7) heat-killed <b>spirochetes</b> seroconverted to OspA, but mice inoculated with fewer <b>spirochetes</b> did not seroconvert to OspA at 2 weeks after inoculation. Growth temperature of <b>spirochetes</b> was not a factor for infectious dose or seroconversion to OspA. <b>Spirochetes</b> grown at 30, 34, or 38 degrees C had the same median infectious dose. Growth temperature did not influence infectious dose when mice were inoculated intraperitoneally or intradermally and did not influence dose-related immunologic recognition of OspA. Mice hyperimmunized with recombinant OspA-glutathione S-transferase (GT) fusion protein or GT (controls) were challenged by syringe inoculation with 10 (3) <b>spirochetes</b> or by transplantation of infected skin from syngenic mice infected for 2 or 8 weeks. OspA-GT-immunized mice resisted syringe challenge but developed disseminated infections following transplantation of infected skin. Identical results were obtained in mice passively immunized with hyperimmune serum to OspA-GT or GT and then challenged by syringe or infected skin transplant. The number of <b>spirochetes</b> in infected skin, determined by quantitative PCR directed toward both plasmid and genomic targets, was less than the syringe challenge dose...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{real-time}} PCR {{was used}} to assay <b>spirochetes</b> in feeding ticks. <b>Spirochetes</b> in tick midguts increased sixfold, from 998 per tick before attachment to 5, 884 at 48 h of attachment. <b>Spirochetes</b> in tick salivary glands increased > 17 -fold, from 1. 2 per salivary gland pair before feeding to 20. 8 at 72 h postattachment. The period of the most rapid {{increase in the number}} of <b>spirochetes</b> in the salivary glands occurred from 48 to 60 h postattachment; this time period coincides with the maximal increase in transmission risk during nymphal tick feeding...|$|R
40|$|A bibliographical {{study was}} made on the {{taxonomy}} of the <b>Spirochetes.</b> Three main problems were discussed as follows : 1) A place for the <b>Spirochetes</b> {{in the world of}} microbes, whether they belong in the protozoa or bacteria, was discussed. The author's opinion was that they belong in the latter. 2) Differentiation between the <b>Spirochetes</b> and the Spirilla was also discussed. Two important points of differences could be noticed in the structural characteristics. Namely, the former possesses the axial flagella and the latter the terminal flagella. Concering the cell membrane, the former has an in sufficient one called as the wall membrane complex, and the latter has a complete one, same as in the Gram-negative bacteria. 3) The classification of the <b>Spirochetes</b> was also discussed, and new idea on this matter was proposed. From these discussions, a newer definition of the <b>Spirochetes</b> was established, after rearrangement and unification of several theories in the taxonomy of the <b>Spirochetes...</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1913, Noguchi {{demonstrated}} {{the presence of}} Treponema pallidum (syphilitic <b>spirochete)</b> in the brain of a progressive paralysis patient, proving that the <b>spirochete</b> {{was the cause of}} the disease. [...] Dr. Noguchi's name is remembered in the binomial attached to another <b>spirochete,</b> Leptospira noguchii.|$|E
2500|$|Bacteria {{which are}} the {{etiological}} cause for a disease are often referred to by the disease name followed by a describing noun (bacterium, bacillus, coccus, agent or {{the name of their}} phylum) e.g. cholera bacterium (Vibrio cholerae) or Lyme disease <b>spirochete</b> (Borrelia burgdorferi), note also rickettsialpox (Rickettsia akari) (for more see [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Although over 200 serotypes of Leptospira {{have been}} described, {{all members of}} the genus have similar morphology. [...] Leptospira are spiral-shaped {{bacteria}} that are 6-20 μm long and 0.1 μm in diameter with a wavelength of about 0.5 μm. [...] One or both ends of the <b>spirochete</b> are usually hooked. [...] Because they are so thin, live Leptospira are best observed by darkfield microscopy.|$|E
40|$|Lyme disease <b>spirochetes,</b> Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, are {{maintained}} in zoonotic cycles involving ticks and small mammals. In unfed ticks, the <b>spirochetes</b> produce one outer surface protein, OspA, but not OspC. During infection in mammals, immunological {{data suggest that}} the <b>spirochetes</b> have changed their surface, now expressing OspC but little or no OspA. We find by in vitro growth experiments that this change is regulated in part by temperature; OspC is produced by <b>spirochetes</b> at 32 - 37 degrees C but not at 24 degrees C. Furthermore, <b>spirochetes</b> in the midgut of ticks that have fully engorged on mice now have OspC on their surface. Thus two environmental cues, an increase in temperature and tick feeding, trigger a major alteration of the spirochetal outer membrane. This rapid synthesis of OspC by <b>spirochetes</b> during tick feeding may play an essential role in the capacity of these bacteria to successfully infect mammalian hosts, including humans, when transmitted by ticks...|$|R
40|$|Background: Oral <b>spirochetes</b> play a {{definitive}} {{role in the}} etiology of periodontitis. But their study is hampered due to difficulty in cultivating them and molecular methods are expensive. Hence the study explores {{the possibility of using}} staining as a screening procedure for the study of oral <b>spirochetes.</b> Experimental approach: The study included 100 patients with chronic periodontitis and 100 controls. Subgingival plaques were collected and silver nitrate staining was performed. The positive slides were screened for density of organisms and an attempt was also made to determine the relative size of <b>spirochetes</b> and their predominance. Findings: There was {{a significant difference in the}} positivity rate between the patients and controls. Higher number of patients had greater density of <b>spirochetes.</b> The presence of large <b>spirochetes</b> in controls was significantly higher. Conclusions: Silver nitrate staining is a useful screening method for detection of <b>spirochetes.</b> It can also be used to assess the cell size, density and post therap...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{studies were}} {{performed}} on the following spirochetes: three Lyme disease <b>spirochetes</b> isolated from Ixodes ticks and from human spinal fluid; three species of North American borreliae; four species of Treponema; and two species of Leptospira. The mol% G+C values for Lyme disease <b>spirochetes</b> were 27. 3 to 30. 5 %, similar to values of 28. 0 to 30. 5 % for Borrelia species but different from the values of Leptospira or Treponema species which ranged from 35. 3 to 53 %. Lyme disease <b>spirochetes</b> represent a new species of Borrelia, with DNA homologies of 31 to 59 % with the three North American strains of Borrelia studied. These studies also showed that Lyme disease <b>spirochetes</b> from three sources constituted a single species, with DNA homologies ranging from 76 to 100 %. A high degree of relatedness was also seen between the three North American borreliae, with homology varying from 77 to 95 %, indicating that these <b>spirochetes</b> represent a single species. Lyme disease <b>spirochetes</b> and Borrelia species exhibited almost no homology with Leptospira and Treponema species (0 to 2 %). Plasmids were detected in the three Lyme disease <b>spirochetes</b> and in the three North American borreliae...|$|R
2500|$|Polymerase chain {{reaction}} (PCR) tests for Lyme disease {{have also been}} developed to detect the genetic material (DNA) of the Lyme disease <b>spirochete.</b> PCR tests are susceptible to false positive results from poor laboratory technique. Even when properly performed, PCR often shows false negative results with blood and cerebrospinal fluid [...] specimens. Hence, PCR is not widely performed for diagnosis of Lyme disease, but it may {{have a role in}} the diagnosis of Lyme arthritis because it is a highly sensitive way of detecting ospA DNA in synovial fluid.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Steere, et al., {{began to}} test {{antibiotic}} regimens in adult patients with Lyme disease. In the same year, New York State Health Dept. epidemiologist Jorge Benach provided Willy Burgdorfer, {{a researcher at}} the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, with collections of I. dammini [...] from Shelter Island, NY, a known Lyme-endemic area as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In examining the ticks for rickettsiae, Burgdorfer noticed [...] "poorly stained, rather long, irregularly coiled spirochetes." [...] Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the [...] "long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease." [...] Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and sera from patients diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour [...] "offered his expertise to culture and immunochemically characterize the organism." [...] Burgdorfer subsequently confirmed his discovery by isolating, from patients with Lyme disease, spirochetes identical to those found in ticks. In June 1982, he published his findings in Science, and the <b>spirochete</b> was named Borrelia burgdorferi in his honor.|$|E

40|$|Of 33 rabbits inoculated with Lyme disease <b>spirochetes,</b> two {{developed}} erythema chronicum migrans at {{the site}} of inoculation. <b>Spirochetes</b> were seen in skin biopsies of one of the lesions with immunoperoxidase and Warthin-Starry stains. <b>Spirochetes</b> were also recovered from the blood of two additional rabbits two weeks post-inoculation. These findings are characteristic of early Lyme disease in humans. In this study, we attempted to develop an animal model of Lyme disease.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of these {{findings}} we believe that we are Justified in saying that the immune serum of Weil's disease is capable of destroying the <b>spirochetes</b> found within the organs in man, {{with the exception of the}} kidneys, and that the action of the serum upon the <b>spirochetes</b> is spirochetolytic and spirocheticidal. The scattered <b>spirochetes</b> in the kidney, on the other hand, are resistant to the action of the immune serum. The <b>spirochetes</b> disappear almost completely from the organs during the convalescent stage of Well's disease, even when no serum has been administered. The only organ to be excepted is again the kidney, but no comparison between. serum-treated and non-serum-treated cases should be made in this respect, for <b>spirochetes</b> are found numerously in the kidneys even with serum treatment. The disappearance of the <b>spirochetes</b> from the organs and tissues in Well's disease seems to be not so marked with the subcutaneous serum treatment as with the intravenous method, but the manner of their disappearance is about the same...|$|R
