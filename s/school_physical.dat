5|$|After {{graduating from}} Abha {{teachers}} college in 1999, Wail al-Shehri {{took a job}} as an elementary <b>school</b> <b>physical</b> education teacher at the Khamis Mushait airbase. Five months into the job, Shehri took leave due to mental illness and depression. Rather than conventional therapy, Wail sought consultation with Muslim clerics, and hoped that a visit to Medina would help. His treatment involved verses from the Qur'an read to him by a sheikh. He traveled to Medina together with Waleed. After the September 11 attacks, others recalled seeing the Shehri brothers in Medina.|$|E

25|$|In the US, trampolining {{was quickly}} {{introduced}} into <b>school</b> <b>physical</b> {{education programs and}} was also used in private entertainment centers. However, following a number of injuries and lawsuits caused by insufficient supervision and inadequate training, trampolining is now mostly conducted in specialist gyms with certified trainers. This has caused a large {{reduction in the number}} of competitive athletes in the United States and a consequent decline from the earlier American prominence in the sport. Elsewhere in the world the sport was most strongly adopted in Europe and the former Soviet Union. Since trampolining became an Olympic sport in 2000, many more countries have started developing programs and China's program developed World Champion athletes in less than a decade.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} {{following}} its opening in 1927, the high <b>school</b> <b>physical</b> plant {{was more than}} sufficient {{for the needs of}} its population. Although four classrooms and a shop were added to the structure in 1939, it was not until 1958 that a large addition (now C Wing) was constructed to accommodate a burgeoning student body. By 1964, the dimensions of a new population explosion were perceived, and a special Board of Education committee was formed to investigate the needs of Columbia High School in the 1970s. As a result of this study, it was calculated that further additions would be required. During the 1970−71 school year, B and D Wings were added at a total cost of $5,250,000.|$|E

500|$|The Cycle Center avoided {{much of the}} {{controversy}} that beset most of Millennium Park by remaining open during the paid rental of {{a large portion of}} the park by Toyota on September 8, 2005. What proved more controversial were McDonald's claims that, since it is providing a healthier menu and fostering grade <b>school</b> <b>physical</b> education in an effort to help its customers improve their health, sponsoring bicycle and exercise activity in the park augments the company's other initiatives. Longtime writer for the Chicago Tribune and current Tribune health and fitness reporter, Julie Deardorff, described the move as a continuation of the '"McDonaldization" [...] of America' and as somewhat [...] "insidious" [...] because the company is making itself more prominent as the social sentiment is to move away from fast food.|$|E
500|$|Varian and {{her parents}} began using the farm name [...] "Varian Arabians" [...] in 1954. She {{credited}} her parents for helping her believe that she could do whatever {{she wanted to do}} and for trusting her own judgement, which gave her confidence in her own ability to work with horses. They worked as a team to build a horse business; Eric, an electrical contractor, built fences and managed the land, Wenonah studied pedigrees, and Sheila handled the horses. In time, their ranch expanded from 21 to 150 acres. As a young adult, Varian completed college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and taught high <b>school</b> <b>physical</b> education for three years, until 1963, when running the Varian Arabian ranch became her full-time job. The ranch was self-supporting from 1963 on, with the short-term assistance of loans from Sheila's aunt, Dorothy Varian, which were promptly repaid. Ultimately, the ranch grew to 230 acres.|$|E
500|$|Planning for the Cycle Center {{was part}} of the larger [...] "Bike 2010 Plan", in which the city aimed to make itself more {{accommodating}} to bicycle commuters. This plan (now replaced by the [...] "Bike 2015 Plan") included provisions for front-mounted two-bike carriers on Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses, permitting bikes to be carried on Chicago 'L' trains, installing numerous bike racks and creating bicycle lanes in streets throughout the city. Additionally, the Chicago metropolitan area's other mass transit providers, Metra and Pace, have developed increased bike accessibility. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley was an advocate of the plan, noting it is also an environmentally friendly effort to cut down on traffic. McDonald's controversially claimed that, since it is providing a healthier menu and fostering grade <b>school</b> <b>physical</b> education in an effort to help its customers improve their health, sponsoring bicycle and exercise activity in the park augments the company's other initiatives.|$|E

By the 1850s, the <b>school</b> <b>physical</b> plant had been expanded to three buildings: a main building, a music building, and a chapel which included the largest auditorium in eastern Alabama and a fully equipped chemistry laboratory.

2500|$|Throughout his petition, Mr. Gettman {{argues that}} while many people [...] "use" [...] cannabis, few [...] "abuse" [...] it. He appears to equate abuse {{with the level}} of {{physical}} dependence and toxicity resulting from cannabis use. Thus, he appears to be arguing that a substance that causes only low levels of physical dependence and toxicity must be considered to have a low potential for abuse. The Secretary does not agree with this argument. Physical dependence and toxicity are not the only factors that are considered in determining a substance's abuse potential. The actual use and frequency of use of a substance, especially when that use may result in harmful consequences such as failure to fulfill major obligations at work or <b>school,</b> <b>physical</b> risk-taking, or even substance-related legal problems, are indicative of a substance's abuse potential. [...] The same and much worse can also be said about the clear abuse of alcohol by many Americans.|$|E
