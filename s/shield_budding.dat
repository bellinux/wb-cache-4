50|$|Propagation {{is usually}} from seed, which can retain {{viability}} {{for several months}} and require around 30 days for germination. Some trees are seedless however, and can be propagated by air-layering or <b>shield</b> <b>budding.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Shield</b> <b>budding,</b> {{also known}} as T-budding, is a {{technique}} of grafting to change varieties of fruit trees. Typically used in fruit tree propagation, {{it can also be}} used for many other kinds of nursery stock. An extremely sharp knife is necessary; specialty budding knives are on the market. A budding knife is a small knife with a type of spatula {{at the other end of}} the handle. The rootstock or stock plant may be cut off above the bud at budding, or one may wait until it is certain that the bud is growing.|$|E
50|$|S. aucuparia is {{planted in}} {{mountain}} ranges to fortify landslides and avalanche zones. It {{is also used}} as an ornamental plant in parks, gardens, or as an avenue tree. Ornamental cultivars include 'Asplenifolia', which has divided and sharply serrated leaflets, 'Blackhawk', which has large fruit and dark green foliage, 'Fastigiata', which has an upright columnar form, 'Fructu Luteo', which has orange yellow fruit, 'Michred', which has brilliant red fruit, 'Pendula', which is a weeping tree, 'Sheerwater Seedling', which is upright and slender, and 'Xanthocarpa', which has orange yellow fruit. Cultivars are vegetatively propagated via cuttings, grafting, or <b>shield</b> <b>budding.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{primordial}} {{germ cells}} (PGCs) in zebrafish were described histologically using eosinophilic granules as a marker. PGC-like cells (PL-cells) with eosinophilic granules were identified initially at the sphere stage (4 -hr postfertilization), and were observed until the bud stage, the earliest stage to which PGCs with proper morphology could be traced. The morphology {{and distribution of}} eosinophilic granules in PL-cells changed during epiboly. Mitoses of PL-cells were observed only from the <b>shield</b> to <b>bud</b> stage, after eosinophilic granules aggregated to the perinuclear region in PGCs. These shifts of eosinophilic granules corresponded histologically to those of germ plasm described in Xenopus. These results suggest that eosinophilic granules represent germ plasm in fish and that PL-cells with these granules correspond to the PGCs or presumptive PGCs (pPGCs) ...|$|R
40|$|When mysterious aliens {{land on a}} misty {{spring morning}} in Central Park, eat brunch, and {{promptly}} disappear, the lives of James Whitewood, a public school Latin teacher, Owen Smith, a teenage football player and Joe Boniface, a New York City cop, become inescapably intertwined as they search for meaning in this potentially apocalyptic event. Upper West Side native James Whitewood finds himself approaching middle age steeped in mediocrity and stunted desires {{until the day he}} witnesses an extraterrestrial invasion of his beloved Central Park. Owen Smith, a small town Missouri boy with dreams of someday falling in love, is wrenched from a promising high school football career and converted to an evangelical religion that looks to alien messiahs for salvation. Joe Boniface, an NYPD officer and veteran of the recent war, tries desperately to <b>shield</b> his <b>budding</b> family in the wake of this startling phenomenon. Following their exposure to these otherworldly beings, the seemingly stagnant futures of James, Owen and Joe are suddenly stirred up by the tendrils of the unimaginable...|$|R
40|$|Mango {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tropical fruits grown in southeast provinces of Iran (Sistan Baluchestan & Hormozgan). Due to the favorable coastal climate conditions in the region mango is extensively grown in these areas. This experiment was carried out at the tropical fruit research station of Bahokalate in Sistan Baluchestan province between 1997 and 1998, using 8 -month-old seedlings raised from local mango trees. The experiment was conducted in a split plot at randomized complete block design, with 3 replications. Grafting was made at 6 fortnight intervals between April 4 and June 19, employing three methods including side grafting, softwood grafting and <b>shield</b> <b>budding.</b> Results showed that the highest percentage of grafting success (67. 2 %) was obtained with grafting in April 4, and side graftings and softwood graftings generally gave higher success rates after 90 days than <b>shield</b> <b>budding</b> (side graftings 65. 8 %, softwood grafting 63. 7 % and <b>shield</b> <b>budding</b> 47. 5 %). After 180 days, the percentage of the grown scions and the length of those grafted in April 4 were 55 % and 57. 9 cm, respectively. After this period, the percentage of the grown scions and the length of the scions in the side grafting method were 65. 6 % and 60. 6 cm, respectively, indicating better results for this method over the other two...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{interest}} {{has been shown}} towards {{the development of the}} saskatoon, Amelanchier alnifolia Nuttal, into a major fruit crop and as an ornamental shrub for the Great Plains region of North America. In much of this region blueberries lack sufficient hardiness or the soil is too calcareous while the saskatoon is widely adapted. The collection and breeding of saskatoons dates back to 1918 at Beaverlodge, Alberta. Only very recently, however, have the problems facing the development of a commercial saskatoon crop been actively investigated. Of the many problems involved in such an endeavor perhaps the one which should have top priority is the production of uniform planting stock by an efficient method. In order to determine how best to satisfactorily propagate clonal stocks of saskatoon, a propagation study including cuttings and <b>shield</b> <b>budding</b> was conducted from May 1975 to September 1976 at the Department of Horticulture Science, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan...|$|E
40|$|The red bud borer Resseliella oculiperda (Rübs.) is a pest insect {{of apple}} trees when {{rootstocks}} are grafted with scion buds by <b>shield</b> <b>budding.</b> The female midges {{are attracted to}} the wounds of the grafted buds where they lay their eggs. The larvae feed on the cambium and destroy the buds completely or partially, leading to bad union of the buds with the rootstocks. Budding strips are used very often by growers to bind scion buds to rootstocks. These strips cannot prevent midges from reaching the damaged tissue. Chemical treatments applied to the grafts {{and other types of}} strip do not provide better protection against the pest and may cause other risks for growers. In orchard experiments in 2000 and 2001, the authors evaluated the repellent action provided by three essential oils and five compounds of plant origin against the midges by impregnating budding strips with them. The essential oils of lavender, Lavandula angustifolia (P. Mill.), and -terpineol decreased the infestation of buds by more than 95 and 80 % respectively. The other potential repellents tested [the essential oil of Juniperus virginiana (L.), citronellal, the essential oil of Cinnamomum camphora (L.) J. Presl, R-carvone, linalool and R-fenchone] decreased infestation by 67, 66, 51, 45, 37 and 25 % respectively. The formulation and commercial development of budding strips impregnated with lavender oil is discussed...|$|E
40|$|BAR domains {{can prevent}} {{membrane}} fission through {{their ability to}} <b>shield</b> necks of <b>budding</b> vesicles from fission-inducing factors. However, the physiological role of this inhibitory function and its regulation is unknown. Here we identify a checkpoint involving the BAR-domain-containing protein Arfaptin- 1 that controls biogenesis of secretory granules at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). We demonstrate that protein kinase D (PKD) phosphorylates Arfaptin- 1 at serine 132, which disrupts the ability of Arfaptin- 1 to inhibit the activity of ADP ribosylation factor, {{an important component of}} the vesicle scission machinery. The physiological significance of this regulatory mechanism is evidenced by loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion due to granule scission defects in pancreatic β cells expressing nonphosphorylatable Arfaptin- 1. Accordingly, depletion of Arfaptin- 1 leads to the generation of small nonfunctional secretory granules. Hence, PKD-mediated Arfaptin- 1 phosphorylation is necessary to ensure biogenesis of functional transport carriers at the TGN in regulated secretion...|$|R
