2500|$|On August 25th, 2002, the Dillinger Escape Plan made {{national}} United Kingdom headlines when at {{the prestigious}} Reading Festival, the band's vocalist Greg Puciato defecated in full view onstage, {{put it into a}} bag, and threw it into the crowd before smearing the rest onto himself, proclaiming [...] "This is a bag of shit, I just wanted to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> so you'll recognize it later on throughout the day" [...] referring to the {{to the quality of the}} music he felt was appearing that day of the festival. The act nearly got the band banned from the U.K. for violation of public-decency laws, despite this the band's set was one of the highest reviewed of the entire festival that year, and was later included in a list of the top one hundred Reading or Leeds performances of the decade and was regarded as one of [...] "The 20 Grossest Moments in Rock" [...] by NME, ranking at number 6. Upon returning to Reading in 2016, Puciato played the opening song [...] "Prancer" [...] sitting on an onstage couch reading a newspaper and drinking tea.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, {{of course}} I ain't scared to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> bill, Ralph," [...] {{returned}} Uriah, hurriedly. [...] "Say!" [...] he burst out, excitedly. [...] "It's a good bill, ain't it?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I dare say; we {{have them}} at much higher prices. I <b>showed</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>this</b> only that <b>you</b> might see that OUR SIXTIES are as {{handsome}} as MR. LACE'S sixty-FIVES. What {{do you think of}} THIS?" ...|$|R
60|$|THIRD. The {{third thing}} that I am {{to speak to}} is, {{that there is a}} fear of God in the heart of some men that is good and godly, but yet doth not for ever abide so. Or you may take it thus--There is a fear of God that is godly but for a time. In my {{speaking}} to, and opening of <b>this</b> to <b>you,</b> I shall observe this method. First. I shall <b>show</b> <b>you</b> what <b>this</b> fear is. Second. I shall <b>show</b> <b>you</b> by whom or what this fear is wrought in the heart. Third. I shall <b>show</b> <b>you</b> what <b>this</b> fear doth in the soul. And, Fourth, I shall <b>show</b> <b>you</b> when <b>this</b> fear is to have an end.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Does it not <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>this?</b> That, {{as every}} {{conceivable}} right {{section of the}} cone discloses the circle, so in all which is fair and symmetric you will discover Deity, if you but analyse it in a right and symmetric direction?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since it is you, sir, I {{may tell}} you that the officer I spoke of is Colonel Hume, and that he bade me <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> ring, which he said you would know, as a token that my story was a correct one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> list, papa," [...] said Patience. Sir Thomas took the list, {{and found that it}} {{contained}} various articles for bedroom and kitchen use,--towels, sheets, pots and pans, knives and forks, and even a set of curtains and a carpet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, I am not dreaming nor am I mad," [...] said Little John, [...] "and if thou wilt {{come with}} me, I will <b>show</b> <b>thee</b> <b>this</b> fair sight, for I {{have seen it}} with mine own eyes. But thou must come alone, good master, lest the others frighten them and they get away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am no {{judge in}} such matters, {{but they are}} ladies {{connected}} and esteemed, who might befriend and counsel you in case of need, and at any rate, {{it is much more}} suitable that you should be on terms of friendly intercourse with them. I am heartily glad they have <b>shown</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> attention." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't do a thing," [...] he declared, [...] "to get Mr. Parker {{into any}} trouble --for a nicer, freer-handed gentleman never came inside the hotel; but I don't know as there's much harm in <b>showing</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> being as you're a friend. I {{picked it up}} in the sitting room after they'd gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May I <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> {{wonderful}} township?" [...] interrupted one of {{the railroad}} magnates approaching with a bow. [...] "Mr. Ralph Lorimer, I am desired to invite you to the celebration dinner. It's the chief's especial wish {{that you should be}} present," [...] and he drew Alice away, leaving my uncle and myself alone.|$|E
6000|$|... 77. And accordingly, when I now <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> {{sketch of}} my {{favorite}} Holbein, {{and tell you that}} it is entirely disgraceful he should not know what a wing was, better, I don't mean that it is disgraceful he should not know the anatomy of it, but that he should never have looked at it to see how the feathers lie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but I don't {{know how}} far you will thank me," [...] {{answered}} Mareschal, [...] "when I <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> letter which I received just before we sat down. My servant {{told me it was}} delivered by a man he had never seen before, who went off at the gallop, after charging him to put it into my own hand." ...|$|E

60|$|Second, I {{now come}} to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> wherein <b>this</b> unity and peace consists, and this I shall {{demonstrate}} in five particulars.|$|R
500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} take white trash T-shirts and {{make it into a}} video. I wanted it to look as phony as possible, I wanted the clouds to go one direction, the {{mountains}} to go one direction, the horses to go over there, cause I want to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> that <b>this</b> is The Hunger Games. I want to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> that <b>this</b> is the type of imagery that's been presented to all of us. And the only difference is a black dude in the middle of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The modesty {{of great}} imagination;' {{that is to}} say, of the power which conceives all things in true relation, and not only as they affect ourselves. I can <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> most {{definitely}} by taking {{one example of the}} modern, and unschooled temper, in Bewick;[AW] and setting it beside Botticelli's treatment of the same subject of thought,--namely, the meaning of war, and the reforms necessary in the carrying on of war.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} {{that you will have}} {{everything}} to do with it. There, Miss Burton, I brought you here to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> very spot, and to make to you my confession here, and to get from you, here, one word of confidence, if you will give it me." [...] Florence was trembling now outwardly as well as inwardly. [...] "You know my story--as far, I mean, as I had a story once, in conjunction with Harry Clavering?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will <b>show</b> <b>you.</b> <b>This</b> {{evening after}} the assault I chanced {{to walk with}} some of my fellows, round yonder small fort upon the knoll {{to see if we}} could spy a weak spot in it. Some of them came to the wall to curse us, and among them whom should I see but a big man with a white face, red hair and a touch of Anthony's fire upon his cheek? What make you of that, Squire Nigel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An {{incident}} like that," [...] Maraton continued, [...] "may <b>show</b> <b>you</b> what <b>this</b> country must lose, for her rivals do {{not give}} away a million pounds for nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will now}} <b>show</b> <b>you</b> why <b>this</b> room {{is called the}} {{laughing}} chamber. Lie down upon the bed a moment--but don't get your shoes against the clean covers." ...|$|R
60|$|SECOND. And {{thus have}} I <b>showed</b> <b>you</b> what <b>this</b> throne of grace is, {{and where it}} stands. And now I shall come to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how you shall find it, and know when you are come to it, by several other things.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, {{pretty well}} I think," [...] said he, sighing, {{as if he}} cared little about the matter. [...] "I wanted to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> Henrietta." [...] And he took up a book where he had marked a passage for her. She saw several paper marks in some other books, and {{perceived}} with shame {{that he had been}} reading yesterday, and choosing out what might comfort her, his selfish sister, as she could not help feeling herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Mr. Stanbury, we {{had better}} <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> telegram," [...] said Sir Marmaduke, who had been {{standing}} with the scrap of paper in his hand since the ring of the bell had been heard. Hugh took the message and read it. [...] "I {{do not know what}} should have made my daughter mention your name," [...] continued Sir Marmaduke;--"but as she has done so, and as perhaps the unfortunate invalid himself may have alluded to you, we thought it best to send for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I brought you," [...] went on Ayesha presently, [...] "that ye {{might look}} upon the most {{wonderful}} sight that ever the eye of man beheld--the full moon shining over ruined Kôr. When ye have done your eating--I would that I could teach you to eat naught but fruit, Kallikrates, but that will come after thou hast laved in the fire. Once I, too, ate flesh like a brute beast. When ye have done we will go out, and I will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> great temple and the God whom men once worshipped therein." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Breakfast Club West explain the concept for the video. [...] "I wanted to take white trash T-shirts and {{make it into a}} video. I wanted it to look as phony as possible, I wanted the clouds to go one direction, the mountains to go one direction, the horses to go over there, cause I want to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> that <b>this</b> is The Hunger Games.

6000|$|... "Because in {{a vision}} she <b>showed</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> monastery, and {{led you to}} a spot beyond the {{mountains}} where she vanished, <b>you</b> hope that <b>this</b> woman whom <b>you</b> saw die is re-incarnated yonder. Why not? In this there is nothing impossible {{to those who are}} instructed in the truth, though the lengthening of her last life was strange and contrary to experience. Doubtless you will find her there as you expect, and doubtless her khama, or identity, is the same as that which in some earlier life of hers once brought me to sin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Vimpany, of course. Oh! {{give him}} the credit where real cleverness is concerned. Vimpany {{suggested}} the thing. He found me well-nigh as desperately hard up as he is himself. He suggested it. At first, I confess, I did not like it. I refused to listen to any more talk about it. But, you see, when one meets destitution face to face, one will do anything--everything. Besides, as I will <b>show</b> <b>you,</b> <b>this</b> {{is not really a}} fraud. It is only an anticipation of a few years. However, there was another reason." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't mean to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> but it's {{the best}} way of {{explaining}} what I think," [...] Jake said with some diffidence. [...] "I'm weak in technique, because I haven't been taught, but I imagine I've got sensibility. It's plain that when you paint a portrait you must study form and color, but there's something else that you can only feel. I don't mean the character that's expressed by the mouth and eyes; it's something vague and elusive that psychologists give you a hint of when they talk about the aura. Of course you can't paint it, but unless it, so to speak, glimmers through the work, your portrait's dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 157. You {{probably}} have never noticed the extreme awkwardness of Holbein in wearing this new dress; you would the less {{do so because}} his own people think him all the finer for it, as the farmer's wife would probably think her daughter. Dr. Woltmann, for instance, is enthusiastic in praise of the splendid architecture {{in the background of}} his Annunciation. A fine mess it must have made in the minds of simple German maidens, in their notion of the Virgin at home! I cannot <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> Annunciation; but I have under my hand one of Holbein's Bible cuts, of the deepest seriousness and import--his illustration of the Canticles, showing the Church as the bride of Christ.|$|E
5000|$|The Long Island Press said [...] "If {{you never}} see another <b>show,</b> <b>you</b> must see <b>this</b> one" ...|$|R
60|$|Third, Having <b>shown</b> <b>you</b> wherein <b>this</b> unity consists, I {{now come}} to the third general thing propounded, and that is, to <b>show</b> <b>you</b> the fruits and {{benefits}} of unity and peace; together with the mischiefs and inconveniences that attend those churches where unity and peace are wanting.|$|R
6000|$|MRS BAINES. Well, won't {{you help}} me {{to get at the}} people? They won't break windows then. Come here, Price. Let me <b>show</b> <b>you</b> to <b>this</b> gentleman [Price comes to be inspected]. Do you {{remember}} the window breaking? ...|$|R
