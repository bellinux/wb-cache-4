Two <b>gyros</b> <b>stabilize</b> {{the stable}} {{platform}} {{and provide for}} various compensations to be introduced, keeping the stable platform level with respect to earth instead of inertial space, and providing a coordinate reference system of three axes. The gyros each have two degrees of freedom, and are oriented so that the spin axes are 90 degrees apart. The upper gyro has its spin axis oriented along the north-south grid coordinate axis and is sensitive to torques (airplane rotations) about the east-west and vertical coordinate axes. The lower gyro has its spin axis oriented along the east-west grid axis and is sensitive to torques about the north-south and vertical axes. Therefore the two gyros control all three axes.|$|R
40|$|Using VLF frequencies, {{transmitted}} by the Navy`s network, for airborne remote sensing of the earth`s electrical, magnetic characteristics was first {{considered by the}} United States Geological Survey (USGS) around the mid 1970 s. The first VLF system was designed and developed by the USGS for installation and operation on a single engine, fixed wing aircraft used by the Branch of Geophysics for geophysical surveying. The system consisted of five channels. Two E-field channels with sensors consisting of a fixed vertical loaded dipole antenna with pre-amp mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and a <b>gyro</b> <b>stabilized</b> horizontal loaded dipole antenna with pre-amp mounted on a tail boom. The three channel magnetic sensor consisted of three orthogonal coils mounted on the same <b>gyro</b> <b>stabilized</b> platform as the horizontal E-field antenna. The main features of the VLF receiver were: narrow band-width frequency selection using crystal filters, phase shifters for zeroing out system phase variances, phase-lock loops for generating real and quadrature gates, and synchronous detectors for generating real and quadrature outputs. In the mid 1990 s the Branch of Geophysics designed and developed a two-channel E-field ground portable VLF system. The system was built using state-of-the-art circuit components and new concepts in circuit architecture. Small size, light weight, low power, durability, and reliability were key considerations {{in the design of the}} instrument. The primary purpose of the instrument was for collecting VLF data during ground surveys over small grid areas. Later the system was modified for installation on a Unmanned Airborne Vehicle (UAV).
