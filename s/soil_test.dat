2500|$|The term 'cyclic liquefaction' {{refers to}} the {{occurrence}} {{of a state of}} soil when large shear strains have accumulated in response to cyclic loading. A typical reference strain for the approximate occurrence of zero effective stress is 5% double amplitude shear strain. [...] This is a <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> based definition, usually performed via cyclic triaxial, cyclic direct simple shear, or cyclic torsional shear type apparatus. These tests are performed to determine a soil's resistance to liquefaction by observing the number of cycles of loading at a particular shear stress amplitude before it 'fails'.

40|$|Soil {{health is}} an {{essential}} requirement of a sustainable, functioning agroecosystem. Tracking soil health to determine sustainability {{at the local level}} largely falls to farmers, even though they often lack access to critical information. We examine farmers’ participation in gathering soil information at the farm and paddock scale {{over the last two decades}} in Australia and the United States, by reviewing national-level reporting of farmer use of <b>soil</b> <b>testing</b> and farm planning as well as qualitative research on farmer perspectives. The level of participation in <b>soil</b> <b>testing</b> and farm planning has remained stable in the last two decades, with only 25 % and 30 % of landholders, respectively, participating nationally, in either country. The review revealed national-level reporting has a number of limitations in understanding farmers’ use of soil information and, in particular, fails to indicate the frequency and intensity of <b>soil</b> <b>testing</b> as well as farmer motivation to <b>test</b> <b>soil</b> or what they did with the soil information. The main use of <b>soil</b> <b>testing</b> is often stated as “determining fertilizer requirements”, yet data show <b>soil</b> <b>testing</b> is used less commonly than is customary practice. In Australia and in the United States, customary practice is three and half times more likely for decisions on fertilizer application levels. The rhetoric is heavy on the use of <b>soil</b> <b>testing</b> as a decision tool, and that it guides best practices. However, given that only a quarter of farmers are <b>soil</b> <b>testing,</b> and doing so infrequently and in low densities, the level of information on soil health is poor. While farmers report consistent monitoring of soil conditions, few have consistent records of such. In contrast to the information on the poor state of soil health, there is strong farmer interest in procuring soil health benefits through changes in farm practices such as conservation tillage or cover crops, even if they are unable to demonstrate these soil health benefits through <b>soil</b> <b>testing.</b> Many farmers report the use of observation in lieu of laboratory testing. Finally, we point to the need for soil information to include observational indicators to best allow a blend of traditional extension strategies with digital technology to create communities of interest in soil management. This would transcend the boundaries between those with expertise and those with experience in soil health management...|$|R
