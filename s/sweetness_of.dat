Today music, as it becomes continually more complicated, strives to amalgamate the most dissonant, strange and harsh sounds. In this way we come ever closer to noise-sound.|$|E

Ratna had no further acting roles, although in 1950 she became Indonesia's first female director with Sedap Malam (<b>Sweetness</b> <b>of</b> the Night), for Djamaluddin Malik's company Persari. Ali, Iskandar, and Djauhari remained active as actors, Ali and Iskandar through the 1960s and Djauhari until the 1970s.

5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the bacon highlights the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> the ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening the bacon, {{in a similar manner}} to pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E

Carrots can also be used alone or blended with fruits in jams and preserves. Carrot juice is also widely marketed, especially as a health drink, either stand-alone or blended with juices extracted from fruits and other vegetables.|$|E
5|$|Andjar's {{screenplay}} Dr Samsi {{was finally}} adapted {{as a film}} in 1952 by Ratna Asmara, who had become Indonesia's first female film director with her 1950 film Sedap Malam (<b>Sweetness</b> <b>of</b> the Night). The adaptation starred Ratna and Raden Ismail. It would prove Andjar's last screenwriting credit during his lifetime. Although no longer writing films, Andjar remained active in the country's film industry. In 1955 he headed the inaugural Indonesian Film Festival, which was criticized when it gave the Best Picture Award to two films, Usmar Ismail's Lewat Djam Malam (After the Curfew) and Lilik Sudjio's Tarmina. Critics wrote that Lewat Djam Malam was easily the stronger of the two and suggested that Djamaluddin Malik, Tarmina producer, had influenced the jury's decision.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up the <b>sweetness</b> <b>of</b> the wine.|$|E

50|$|From these {{beginnings}} in {{the early}} 20th century, the theory <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> enjoyed little further academic attention until 1963, when Robert Shallenberger and Terry Acree proposed the AH-B theory <b>of</b> <b>sweetness.</b> Simply put, they proposed that to be sweet, a compound must contain a hydrogen bond donor (AH) and a Lewis base (B) separated by about 0.3 nanometres. According to this theory, the AH-B unit of a sweetener binds with a corresponding AH-B unit on the biological sweetness receptor to produce the sensation <b>of</b> <b>sweetness.</b>|$|R

This study investigated (a) the dynamics of {{the formation}} of oral oil coatings formed by o/w emulsions and (b) the effect of oral oil coatings on subsequent <b>sweetness</b> perception <b>of</b> sucrose solutions. In vivo fluorescence was used to quantitate the oil fraction deposited on the tongue after oral processing of oil-in-water emulsions for different times. A trained panel evaluated <b>sweetness</b> perception <b>of</b> sucrose solutions after orally processing the emulsions. The oil fraction reached its maximum value within the first 3 s of oral processing. The oil fraction did not significantly affect subsequent <b>sweetness</b> perception <b>of</b> sucrose solutions. It is suggested that the oil droplets deposited on the tongue did not form a hydrophobic barrier that is sufficient to reduce the accessibility of sucrose to taste buds...|$|R

Study of Cilembu sweet potato based on land characteristics on cultivation location and sweetness quality along storage periods between different cultivation locations is limited. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determined influence of land characteristics of cultivation locations and storage periods on <b>sweetness</b> quality <b>of</b> Cilembu sweet potato. Samples were taken from harvested tubers from Cilembu, Rancakalong, Sukasari, Cicalengka, and Jalaksana cultivation location using purposive sampling method.

It is widely assumed that sensing a liked food or drink evokes a pleasurable experience, but the only psychological evidence for this assumption has been tongue movements that are elicited specifically by sweet taste in animals and human neonates. We found that adults felt such movements in response to drinking juice at both their personally preferred level <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> and levels they deemed so sweet as to be undrinkable. Yet only the intolerably strong level <b>of</b> <b>sweetness</b> elicited enjoyment <b>of</b> the experienced movements, elevation of mood, and a sense of smiling.
