[...] Shipwreck historian Frederick Stonehouse wrote: As reported in the local papers, ‘the barge blew three whistles, the Alberta answering, and checked down to seven miles per hour, but in a moment the Osborn appeared under the Alberta’s bow and the latter struck her midway between the main and mizzen masts on the starboard <b>side,</b> <b>cutting</b> her almost in twain.’ [...] When the larger , 2,282 ton, steel steamer Alberta rammed the smaller , 891 ton, wooden Osborn, she penetrated [...] {{to the center of}} the ship cutting her almost in two.

[...] Alberta stayed locked with Osborn long enough for Captain Wilford and his wife to transfer to her. One of the Alberta’s passengers jumped to the Osborn to save three lives, including Captain Wilford’s children. While this rescuer from Alberta was still below decks, the Osborn broke free and sank, taking his life along with those of two crewmen.|$|E

Documents regarding its earliest dates of construction have been lost; it is first mentioned in 1393. Parts of the castle were built during the Renaissance and baroque periods.

The castle remained in private hands till 1921, when it was deeded to the city of Bochum. In 1961, a museum of local history was installed, including a large collection of 16th to 20th century musical instruments. A collection of East Asian objects is also now located there, as well as a satellite of the Bochum Museum and an art exhibition space. There is also a restaurant on site.

50|$|The 109th and 110th Regiments of the 28th Division, however, fared worse, as {{they were}} spread so thinly that their {{positions}} were easily bypassed. Both offered stubborn resistance {{in the face of}} superior forces and threw the German schedule off by several days. The 110th's situation was by far the worst, as it was responsible for an 11 mi front while its 2nd Battalion was withheld as the divisional reserve. Panzer columns took the outlying villages and widely separated strong points in bitter fighting, and advanced to points near Bastogne within four days. The struggle for the villages and American strong points, plus transport confusion on the German side, slowed the attack sufficiently to allow the 101st Airborne Division (reinforced by elements from the 9th and 10th Armored Divisions) to reach Bastogne by truck on the morning of 19 December. The fierce defense of Bastogne, in which American paratroopers particularly distinguished themselves, made it impossible for the Germans to take the town with its important road junctions. The panzer columns swung past on either <b>side,</b> <b>cutting</b> off Bastogne on 20 December but failing to secure the vital crossroads.|$|E

Firstly the cutting forces were measured using dynamometer which is taken from reference, then finite element method (FEM) was used to obtain the cutting tool deflection which is finite element analysis (FEA).

40|$|For a {{solid carbide}} tapered end-mill, every flute {{includes}} a flute surface and a rake face along a helical <b>side</b> <b>cutting</b> edge, and the end-mill core {{is at the}} center and is tangent to all the flutes. The flutes significantly affect the tools cutting performance and life, and the core radius mainly affects the tools rigidity. Mainly, two methods are adopted in industry to grind the flutes; these are: the direct method and the inverse method. In the direct method, a flute is ground using a standard grinding-wheel moving in multi-axis machining to generate the rake face and the flute surface. However, the flute is the natural outcome of the grinding process without any control. On the other side, the inverse method employs the concept of inverse engineering to build a grinding-wheel that accurately grinds the end-mill flutes. This yields a free-form grinding-wheel profile that is used on a 2 -axis grinding machine; however, the flute shapes are only exact on one section of the end-mill; when the grinding-wheel moves along the <b>side</b> <b>cutting</b> edge to smaller sections; the deviation of the generated flute from the designed one will be increased. Thus, neither can this method grind the rake face with the prescribed normal rake angle, nor generate the <b>side</b> <b>cutting</b> edge in good agreement with its design. Moreover, the grinding-wheel profile is very difficult and expensive to make. To address these problems, a practical and optimal approach for five-axis grinding of prescribed end-mill flutes is proposed by; first, establishing a 5 -axis flute grinding theory describing the wheels locations and orientations during grinding the rake faces with constant normal rake angles; Second, introducing a simple grinding-wheel consisting of lines and circular arcs; and finally, applying an optimization algorithm to optimize the grinding-wheel shape and path. Overall, this approach significantly advances the CNC programming technique for the 5 -axis flute grinding, and can substantially increase the quality of the solid carbide end-mills and lays a good foundation for the CAD/CAE/CAM of end-mills. The advantages of this approach over the other approaches are verified using computer simulation...|$|E
