50|$|MIMO is a {{technology}} that uses multiple antennas to coherently resolve more information than possible using a single antenna. One way it provides this is through Spatial Division Multiplexing (SDM), which spatially multiplexes multiple independent data streams, transferred simultaneously within one spectral channel of bandwidth. MIMO SDM can significantly increase data throughput {{as the number of}} resolved spatial data streams is increased. Each <b>spatial</b> <b>stream</b> requires a discrete antenna at both the transmitter and the receiver. In addition, MIMO technology requires a separate radio-frequency chain and analog-to-digital converter for each MIMO antenna, making it more expensive to implement than non-MIMO systems.|$|E

Again, MU-MIMO beamforming is used to enable the base station to transmit independent data streams to multiple handsets on the same channel at the same time.

Changes compared to 802.11n include wider channels (80 or 160 MHz versus 40 MHz) in the 5 GHz band, more spatial streams (up to eight versus four), higher-order modulation (up to 256-QAM vs. 64-QAM), {{and the addition of}} Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO). As of October 2013, high-end implementations support 80 MHz channels, three spatial streams, and 256-QAM, yielding a data rate of up to 433.3 Mbit/s per <b>spatial</b> <b>stream,</b> 1300 Mbit/s total, in 80 MHz channels in the 5 GHz band.

50|$|MU-MIMO {{is part of}} the IEEE 802.11ac {{standard}}, {{the first}} Wi-Fi standard to offer speeds in the gigabit per second range. MU-MIMO enables an access point (AP) to transmit to up to four client devices simultaneously. This eliminates contention delays, but requires frequent channel measurements to properly direct the signals. Each user may employ up to four of the available eight spatial streams. For example, an AP with eight antennas can talk to two client devices with four antennas, providing four spatial streams to each. Alternatively, the same AP can talk to four client devices with two antennas each, providing two spatial streams to each. Multi-user MIMO beamforming even benefits single <b>spatial</b> <b>stream</b> devices. Prior to MU-MIMO beamforming, an access point communicating with multiple client devices could only transmit to one at a time. With MU-MIMO beamforming, the access point can transmit to up to four single stream devices at the same time on the same channel.|$|E
5000|$|IEEE 802.11af, also {{referred}} to as [...] "White-Fi" [...] and [...] "Super Wi-Fi", is an amendment, approved in February 2014, that allows WLAN operation in TV white space spectrum in the VHF and UHF bands between 54 and 790 MHz. It uses cognitive radio technology to transmit on unused TV channels, with the standard taking measures to limit interference for primary users, such as analog TV, digital TV, and wireless microphones. Access points and stations determine their position using a satellite positioning system such as GPS, and use the Internet to query a geolocation database (GDB) provided by a regional regulatory agency to discover what frequency channels are available for use at a given time and position. The physical layer uses OFDM and is based on 802.11ac. The propagation path loss as well as the attenuation by materials such as brick and concrete is lower in the UHF and VHF bands than in the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands, which increases the possible range. The frequency channels are 6 to 8 MHz wide, depending on the regulatory domain. Up to four channels may be bonded in either one or two contiguous blocks. MIMO operation is possible with up to four streams used for either space-time block code (STBC) or multi-user (MU) operation. The achievable data rate per <b>spatial</b> <b>stream</b> is 26.7 Mbit/s for 6 and 7 MHz channels, and 35.6 Mbit/s for 8 MHz channels.

Based on their performance on the LiSN-S test, participants with normal and impaired <b>spatial</b> <b>stream</b> segregation ability were assigned to the control group (n= 12) and the FM group (n= 10) respectively. Participants from the latter group were provided with and required to use the personal ear-level FM devices during school time for a period of eight weeks. The impact of the FM systems was determined by both quantitative and qualitative data, which were gathered at three sampling points: (1) Before FM trial; (2) At the end of the FM trial (i. e. after eight weeks of use); and finally (3) At eight weeks following withdrawal of the FM systems. Results: Results revealed children with APD improved on their ability to segregate spatial streams following the use of personal FM devices, whereas control participants did not exhibit this change. The personal FM devices seemed to provide the greatest benefit to the younger participants. Qualitative measures, including individualised Goal Attainment Scales (GAS), indicated positive improvements in auditory behaviours following the use of FM devices in all participants.

Compared with previous IEEE standards, this significant performance improvement {{can be attributed to}} the novel physical and medium access control (MAC) features, such as multi-user multiple-input multiple-output transmissions, the frame aggregation, and the channel bonding. In this paper, we first briefly survey the main features of IEEE 802.11 ac, and then, we evaluate these new features in a fully connected wireless mesh network using an analytic model and simulations. More specifically, the performance of the MAC scheme defined by IEEE 802.11 ac, which employs the explicit compressed feedback (ECFB) mechanism for the channel sounding, is evaluated. In addition, we propose an extended request-to-send/clear-to-send scheme that integrates the ECFB operation to compare with the IEEE 802.11 ac-defined one in saturated conditions. The comparison of the two MAC schemes is conducted through three <b>spatial</b> <b>stream</b> allocation algorithms. A simple but accurate analytical model is derived for the two MAC schemes, the results of which are validated with simulations.

However, the exact details of the mapping are not specified. Interleaving of <b>spatial</b> <b>streams</b> across antennas is important to achieve spatial diversity for MIMO systems. for MIMO. Starting on page 362, the vertical encoder proposed for spatially-multiplexed MIMO systems does not specify details of the blocks shown in Figure 251 c, i. e. the Encoder, Modulation, Demux and Sub-carrier mapping/PRBS blocks. It is important to design these blocks carefully to fully exploit spatial and frequency diversity with all types of receivers. In this contribution we propose space-frequency bit-interleaved coded modulation (SF-BICM) “vertical-encoded ” architecture which interleaves FEC blocks across both <b>spatial</b> <b>streams</b> and frequency tones. <b>Spatial</b> <b>streams</b> are multiple data streams transmitted over multiple antennas, both in open-loop and closed-loop modes. Space-frequency interleaving provides spatial diversity in addition to frequency diversity, especially with minimum mean squared error (MMSE) spatial filters per tone.

40|$|To {{approach}} the potential MIMO capacity while optimizing the system {{bit error rate}} (BER) performance, the joint transmit and receive minimum mean squared error (MMSE) design has been proposed. It is the optimal linear scheme for spatial multiplexing MIMO systems, assuming a fixed number of <b>spatial</b> <b>streams</b> {{as well as a}} fixed modulation and coding across these <b>spatial</b> <b>streams.</b> However, state-of-the-art designs arbitrarily choose and fix the value of the number of <b>spatial</b> <b>streams,</b> which may lead to an inefficient power allocation strategy and a poor BER performance. We have previously proposed to relax the constraint of fixed number of streams and to optimize this value under the constraints of fixed average total transmit power and fixed spectral efficiency, which we referred to as spatial-mode selection. Our previous selection criterion was the minimization of the system sum MMSE. In the present contribution, we introduce a new and better spatial-mode selection criterion that targets the minimization of the system BER. We also provide a detailed performance analysis, over flat-fading channels, that confirms that our proposed spatial-mode selection significantly outperforms state-of-the-art joint Tx/Rx MMSE designs for both uncoded and coded systems, thanks to its better exploitation of the MIMO spatial diversity and more efficient power allocation. </p...|$|R
