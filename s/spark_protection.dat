40|$|ABSTRACT: A novel {{read-out}} architecture {{has been}} developed for the Micromegas detector. The anode element is made of a resistive layer on a ceramic substrate. The detector part is entirely separated from the read-out element. Without significant loss, signals are transmitted by capacitive coupling to the read-out pads. The detector provides high gas gain, good energy resolution and the resistive layer assures <b>spark</b> <b>protection</b> to the electronics. This assembly could be combined with modern pixel array electronic ASICs. This readout organization is free on how the pixels are designed, arranged and connected. We present first results taken with a Medipix 2 read-out chip...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} prototypes of GEM-like detectors with resistive electrodes {{to be used}} as RICH photodetectors equipped with CsI photocathodes. The main advantages of these detectors are their intrinsic <b>spark</b> <b>protection</b> and possibility to operate at high gain (~ 10 E 5) in many gases including poorly quenched ones, allowing for the adoption of windowless configurations in which the radiator gas is also used in the chamber. Results of systematic studies of the resistive GEMs combined with CsI photocathodes are presented: its quantum efficiency, rate characteristics, long-term stability, etc. On the basis of the obtained results, we believe that the new detector will be a promising candidate for upgrading the ALICE RICH detecto...|$|E
40|$|Piggyback Micromegas {{consists}} {{in a novel}} readout architecture where the anode element is made of a resistive layer on a ceramic substrate. The resistive layer is deposited on the thin ceramic substrate by an industrial process which provides large dynamic range of resistivity (10 ^ 6 to 10 ^ 10 MΩ/square). The particularity of this new structure is that the active part is entirely dissociated from the read-out element. This gives a large flexibility {{on the design of}} the anode structure and the readout scheme. Without significant loss, signals are transmitted by capacitive coupling to the read-out pads. The detector provides high gas gain, good energy resolution and the resistive layer assures <b>spark</b> <b>protection</b> for the electronics. This assembly could be combined with modern pixel array electronic ASICs. First tests with different Piggyback detectors and configurations will be presented. This structure is adequate for cost effective fabrication and low outgassing detectors. It was designed to perform in sealed mode and its long term stability has been extensively studied. In addition perspectives on the future developments will be evoked. Comment: 7 pages, prepared for the MPGD 2013 conferenc...|$|E
50|$|Former Justice Minister Liang Qichao {{saw through}} the ruse and {{encouraged}} the Yunnan clique to rebel against Yuan, <b>sparking</b> the National <b>Protection</b> War. The war went badly for Yuan, as he faced almost universal opposition. Most of his lieutenants deserted him. In {{order to win}} them back he announced {{the end of the}} Empire of China on March 22, 1916. However, his enemies called for his resignation as president. In June, Yuan died of uremia, leaving a fractured republic in his wake.|$|R
50|$|As {{a member}} of the MIT Outing Club during the late 1950s and early 1960s, Crowther also played an {{important}} role in the development of rock climbing in the Shawangunks in New York State. (Waterman, 1993, p. 146) He began climbing there in the 1950s and continues to climb today. He made the first ascent of several classic routes including Arrow, Hawk, Moonlight, and Senté. Some of these routes <b>sparked</b> controversy because <b>protection</b> bolts were placed on rappel; a new tactic that Crowther and several others began to use at the time. The community reaction to this technique was an important part of the evolution of climbing ethics in the Shawangunks and beyond.|$|R
25|$|Wildlife {{conservation}} in Canada was <b>sparked</b> by the <b>protection</b> of animals for tourism and recreation. Howard Douglas, an appointed superintendent of Rocky Mountains Park in 1897 {{first began to}} expand and preserve wildlife to attract more visitors to the park. However, between 1900 and 1920 Canada saw {{a dramatic change in}} national attitudes from focus in tourism {{to the creation of the}} National Parks Branch, world's first governmental organization dedicated to parks, and the development of other governmental organizations like the Commission of Conservation. Canadian Commission of Conservation that established in 1909 was intended to be an independent body dealing with questions of natural resource {{conservation in}} Canada. In the early years of the Commission, wildlife investigations were mostly focused on resource-commodity species such as fish and fur-bearing animals and later developed to include greater variety of species.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays RPCs are in {{a booming}} phase: they are {{successfully}} used in many experiments, including LHC; there are ambitious plans to use them in several upgrade detectors and in some new experiments {{as well as in}} various applications. The aim {{of this paper is to}} highlight the main challenges which the RPC community may face in the next few years and which were addressed in talks presented at this conference. Examples could be: new and difficult requirements from experiments (and their upgrades) and applications, optimization and improvements of the existing traditional detector designs, improvement of their characteristics (timing /rate performance, aging, dark current and so on), implementation of new more sensitive electronics, investigation of new materials, development of large- area detectors. We will also review the fast and very promising developments of another type of resistive electrode gaseous detector -micropattern detectors having at least one of their electrodes made of resistive materials. These innovative detectors combine in one design the best features of RPC (<b>spark</b> <b>protection)</b> and micropattern detectors (high granularity-high position resolution).

40|$|Aging {{studies of}} the first resistive-micromegas quadruplet at GIF++: {{preliminary}} results A resistive-micromegas quadruplet built at CERN, serving as prototype of the ATLAS micromegas, has been installed at the new CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF++) {{with the aim of}} carrying out a long-term aging study. The detector has four active layers about 0. 5 m 2 each equipped with 1024 read-out strips and sputtered resistive layer for <b>spark</b> <b>protection.</b> It is exposed to an intense gamma irradiation (~ 50 MHz/cm 2 provided by the 16. 65 TBq 137 Cs source of GIF++), corresponding to ~ 10 times more the expected counting rate at High-Luminosity LHC. Two smaller resistive bulk-micromegas produced at the CERN PCB workshop have also been installed at GIF++ in order to provide a comparison of the aging behavior with the micromegas quadruplet. We will give an overview of the aging properties of the resistive micromegas after few months of irradiation at GIF++. Detector aging evolution will be presented in terms of dark and amplification currents, efficiency and noise stability {{as a function of the}} integrated charge. A first measurement of the sensitivity of the micromegas quadruplet to 137 Cs gammas will also be presented...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the most recent}} efforts made by various groups in implementing resistive electrodes in micropattern gaseous detectors with the aim to combine in the same design the best features of RPCs (for the example, their robustness and <b>spark</b> <b>protection</b> property) with the high granularity and thus the good position resolution offered by microelectronic technology. In the stream of this activity, we have recently developed two novel detectors with resistive electrodes: one was based on resistive micromeshes and the second one is a MSGC with resistive electrodes. We have demonstrated that the resistive meshes are a convenient construction element for various designs of spark protective detectors: RPCs type, GEM type and MICROMEGAS type. These new detectors enable to considerably enhance the RPC and micropattern detectors applications since they feature not only a high position resolution but also a relatively good energy resolution (25 - 30 persent FWHM at 6 keV) and, if necessary, they can operate in cascaded mode allowing the achievement of a high overall gas gain. The main conclusion from these studies is that the implementation of resistive electrodes in micropattern detectors makes them fully spark protected; on this basis we consider this direction very promising...|$|E
40|$|The goal of ranking and {{selection}} (R&S) procedures {{is to identify}} the best stochastic system from among a finite set of competing alternatives. Such procedures require constructing estimates of each system's performance, which can be obtained simultaneously by running multiple independent replications on a parallel computing platform. However, nontrivial statistical and implementation issues arise when designing R&S procedures for a parallel computing environment. This dissertation develops efficient parallel R&S procedures. In this dissertation, several design principles are proposed for parallel R&S procedures that preserve statistical validity and maximize core utilization, especially when large numbers of alternatives or cores are involved. These principles are followed closely by the three parallel R&S procedures analyzed, each of which features a unique sampling and screening approach, and a specific statistical guarantee {{on the quality of}} the final solution. Finally, in our computational study we discuss three methods for implementing R&S procedures on parallel computers, namely the Message-Passing Interface (MPI), Hadoop MapReduce, and Apache Spark, and show that MPI performs the best while <b>Spark</b> provides good <b>protection</b> against core failures at the expense of a moderate drop in core utilization. 2021 - 02 - 0...|$|R
