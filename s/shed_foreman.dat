5000|$|Working {{conditions}} in the shed were extremely poor and the <b>Shed</b> <b>Foreman</b> later wrote [...] "The {{conditions in}} which the boiler washers and tube cleaners worked in winter beggared description with boilers being emptied and blown down, others being washed out and steam and water everywhere" [...] This state of affairs led to the preparation of plans to modernize the depot.|$|E
5000|$|In 1914 the District Locomotive Superintendent was {{responsible}} for the shed which at this point employed 260 footplate staff with a further 50 at the various out stations such as Cromer, Mundesley, Sheringham, Dereham, Foulsham and Forncett. The DLS had a running <b>shed</b> <b>foreman</b> and two other foremen who looked after the sheds at Lowestoft and Yarmouth. In addition to the footplate staff there were 120 fitting staff who were under the control of another foreman. These staff were actually located in the adjacent [...] "factory" [...] building where the major repairs were carried out.|$|E
50|$|The last <b>shed</b> <b>foreman</b> was Pete Hodges and {{the last}} person to sign on at Barrow Hill was Joe Denston for the up sidings preparer. The last {{locomotives}} to use the shed on its final day of operation were four diesels. Class 58, number 58 016 came on shed at 11:00. Class 58, number 58 027 came on shed at 11:30 and coupled up to 58016. Both Class 58s left for Worksop at 11:40. Class 20, numbers 20 197 and 20 073 arrived on shed at 12:00. Both Class 20 locomotives left for Worksop at 12:10, driven by driver Bob Hill.|$|E
50|$|Sibanda {{was born}} in Filabusi, Matabeleland South. He worked on the Rhodesia {{railways}} (National Railways of Zimbabwe after 1980) and was a trade unionist before going into politics as Welfare Secretary of ZAPU (being jailed by the Rhodesian government from 1976 to 1979. After independence in 1980 he continued {{his work as a}} train driver at the NRZ. During his time at the NRZ he was active in the trade union and became the ZCTU president. At the same time he was promoted to Running <b>Shed</b> <b>Foreman</b> at the NRZ by the time he won the 2000 parliamentary elections as an MP for Nkulumane constituency.|$|E
50|$|The {{excursion}} train (even in the 15-vehicle form {{in which}} it set off) {{should have been able}} to climb Armagh bank at about 15 mph (24 km/h). The inspector considered that its failure to do so must have been due to some want of proper management of the engine by its insufficiently experienced driver. The locomotive <b>shed</b> <b>foreman</b> at Dundalk was criticised for want of judgement in not sending a more experienced driver and in his choice of engine. The 2-4-0 supplied would have had insufficient margins (even when hauling a 13-vehicle excursion train) to be sure of maintaining a safe speed over the more onerous gradients further up the line. For a 15-vehicle excursion, assistance should have been given by the engine of the regular train.|$|E
5000|$|For {{several years}} after 1849 engines were stabled in the open on a siding set aside for this purpose. The first shed was a wooden {{structure}} opened in [...] by the London and Birmingham Railway which was blown down in 1852. A brick built replacement was provided in 1855 which was later enlarged in 1870 to receive extra locomotives from [...] shed which closed in 1874. In 1881, a large 10-road replacement shed was constructed in the triangle of lines {{to the south of}} the station, with the 1855 shed subsequently used for carriage storage. This shed, which was often referred to as Bridge Street, was located near the Grand Union Canal and could accommodate 50 engines. Measuring 228 x 132 ft with a 42 ft turntable, the shed was initially coded as No. 5 and became No. 6 on the opening of Bescot. For administrative purposes, it was merged with Colwick shed upon the grouping and both remained {{under the control of the}} same <b>shed</b> <b>foreman</b> until Colwick's closure in 1932. Northampton was coded 2C in 1935 when it was merged with Rugby shed; it remained 2C until December 1963 when it was recoded 1H by British Railways.|$|E
