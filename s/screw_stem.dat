40|$|Abstract. Based on monofactorial {{comparison}} experiment, {{the following}} two excellent technological formations was derived {{for the production of}} starch-based totally-biodegradable tray via extruding, pelleting, slicing, and sucking molding: The first formulation: 40 % of starch, 12. 5 % of DOP, 5 % of EVA, 15 % of polyvinyl alcohol, 20 % of talc power and calcium carbonate, and 7. 5 % of other materials. The material temperature in high-speed kneader was about 90 ˚C, rotation velocity was 600 r/min, kneading duration was 5 ~ 10 minutes, diameter of <b>screw</b> <b>stem</b> of extruder was 90 mm, ratio of length versus diameter of <b>screw</b> <b>stem</b> (L/D) was 44, rotation velocity of the screws stem was 40 ~ 50 r/min. Temperature in four segments of extruder were 145 ˚C, 155 ˚C, 150 ˚C, and 160 ˚C respectively, and temperature in extruder head was 170 ˚C; the material rod extruded was set while passing a cold water bath, and then was cut to pellets whose size was 3 mm× 3 mm; the latter was transformed into slices and subject to sucking molding after predrying; temperature of sucking molding was 180 ~ 190 ˚C, and sucking molding duration was 15 ~ 20 seconds.

30|$|After the {{self-drilling}} screws fractures, the shear connectors failed. However, {{screw caps}} of Group E and <b>screw</b> <b>stems</b> of Group F were still {{embedded in the}} concrete and they kept sliding along with the C-Channels. The parts of these screws were like minor shear connectors until they were secondly cut. This is why the data of specimens with shear connectors is more irregular than it of Group C during this process.|$|R
50|$|Auger {{drilling}} is {{done with}} a helical screw which is driven into the ground with rotation; the earth is lifted up the borehole by the blade of the <b>screw.</b> Hollow <b>stem</b> auger drilling is used for softer ground such as swamps where the hole will not stay open by itself for environmental drilling, geotechnical drilling, soil engineering and geochemistry reconnaissance work in exploration for mineral deposits. Solid flight augers/bucket augers are used in harder ground construction drilling. In some cases, mine shafts are dug with auger drills. Small augers can be mounted {{on the back of}} a utility truck, with large augers used for sinking piles for bridge foundations.|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{studying}} bone remodeling around prostheses, a segmental replacement for the goat tibia was designed, using a conical, screw-threaded, hydroxyapatite-coated stem for fixation. Eight goats were provided with the implant, seven of which loosened within 10 days post-operatively, displaying progressive radiolucency and gross rotational motion. The eighth one also loosened radiographically, but developed a stabilizing callus bridge to prevent motion. A second design of similar shape and coating, but lacking the screw threads, was designed and also applied in eight animals. In this case, no loosening occurred in the first 6 weeks post-operatively. It is concluded that the application of <b>screwed</b> intramedullary <b>stems</b> for prosthetic fixation is not a viable concept, because the threads prevent the stem from subsiding and restabilizing when minor initial interface stress-relaxation and remodeling has occurred...|$|R

The present report describes a case of failure of the screw coupling between the stem and the femoral component. The cause of the failure is surmised with outline of the treatment in this case with extensive femoral bone loss. Revision implant stability was augmented {{with the use of}} a cemented femoral <b>stem,</b> <b>screw</b> fixation and the metaphyseal sleeve of an S-ROM modular hip system (DePuy international Ltd) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{hospital}} {{suffered a}} major fire in 1765 and was rebuilt again {{according to the}} style of French architecture, that is to say, with large walls composed of rough stone called rubble that had been squared and covered in plaster. The architecture, which is very utilitarian, is rudimentary and has little ornamentation. The gable roof prevents the accumulation of snow in winter. The structure, being less massive and simpler to build meant a lower risk of fire. Finally, esses are used to reinforce the structure with <b>stems</b> <b>screwed</b> into the wood frame.|$|R
30|$|The {{stability}} of the implant-abutment connection comes from both the screw function and the frictional resistance between the conical, contacting metallic surfaces of the connection [10]. An abutment screw provides stability via a clamping force [11, 12]. When rotational torque {{is applied to the}} screw, the screw elongates and causes stress on the stem and threads. After that, elastic recovery of the <b>screw</b> occurs, the <b>stem</b> and threads of the screw are in tension and a clamping force is created, pulling the abutment and the implant together. This clamping force is parallel to the axis of the implant and is also known as preload. The preload value is directly proportional to screw elongation. The more screw elongation remains after elastic recovery, the greater is the preload value.|$|R
40|$|Osseointegration {{is vital}} to the success of total knee arthroplasty. This {{intimate}} bone integration however, mostly occured on the femoral component but not on the tibial component. Failure to achieve sufficient primary fixation of the tibial component has been regarded as the major factor affecting bone growth. The problem would be more apparent under eccentric loading which created complex rocking motions in both flexion and extension during gait. Fixation features in terms of protrusion on the undersurface of the tibial component include flange, <b>screws</b> and <b>stem.</b> In this study, the effect of three fixation features under physiological loading was analysed using non-linear contact finite element analysis. Three dimensional model of a human tibia was reconstructed from CT dataset. Three different tibial compartments â€” the cross-flange, the linear flange and the tapered cylindrical shaft â€” were modeled without the polymeric tibial insert. The component was then positioned on the tibial plateau and bone preparation was virtually simulated. Each model was then meshed with solid tetrahedrals and material properties were assigned to the bone and the prostheses. Coefficient of friction between the bone and the implant was set to 0. 3. Pressure was applied on the medial plateau with magnitude corresponds to an eccentric load of 1250 N. Non-linear contact analysis was performed on each of the three components, together with a validated micromotion algorithm to predict instability at the bone-implant interface. Results showed that the cross flange was the most stable under eccentric load with micromotion values did not exceed the threshold limit for osseointegration...|$|R
40|$|Coating {{characteristics}} such as composition, crystallite features and topography collectively impact the cell response. The influence from splats {{has not yet been}} assessed for hydroxyapatite (HAp) thermal spray coatings. The objective of this work is to (a) survey the topography on commercial implants, (b) ascertain topography formation from single splats, and (c) determine the osteoclast resorption pattern on a topographically refined coating compared to dentine. Coatings on dental implants, an orthopedic <b>screw,</b> a femoral <b>stem</b> and a knee implant were studied for reference. The effects of substrate pre-heat, roughness, spray distance and particle size on the coating roughness and topography were studied. Human-derived osteoclasts were placed on a coating with refined topography and compared to dentine, a polished coating and polished sintered HAp. A pre-heat of at least 200 °C on titanium was required to form rounded splats. The greatest influence on coating roughness and topography arose from particle size. A 2 -fold increase in the mean particle size from 30 to 72 μm produced a significant difference (P< 0. 001) in roughness from 4. 8 and 9. 7 μm. A model is shown to illustrate topography formation, nanostructure evolution on single splats, and the topography as seen in commercial implants. Osteoclasts showed a clear preference for activity on coatings with refined topography. A one-way ANOVA test revealed a significantly greater pit depth (P= 0. 022) for dentine (14 μm) compared to the as-sprayed and polished coating (5 μm). Coatings with topography display a similar number of resorption pits with dentine, but a 10 -fold greater number than polished coatings, emphasizing the importance of flattened droplet topography on implant surfaces.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of the {{mechanical}} testing of a new generation modular endoprosthesis, which has been designed to improve the results of mandibular reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The new cementless endoprosthesis consists of a male part, a female part (both with <b>screws</b> on the <b>stems),</b> connected via a dove-tailed connection and secured with a coronal screw. The endoprosthesis was fitted into standardized blocks of synthetic bone (Synbone AG, Malans, Switzerland). The set-up was fixed to an ElectroPuls testing machine at one end and loaded at the other end 25 mm away. Three specimens were loaded continuously until failure to determine the average load to failure of the construct. Five specimens were then loaded cyclically between 10 and 150 N until either failure or 500, 000 cycles. A finite element analysis was also performed on the set-up. RESULTS: Of the five specimens in the fatigue testing, only one survived while the other four either were bent or fractured at the stem of the clamped portion. The specimen that survived had very good bony contact with the prosthesis at the lower border. The connection of the modules via the dove-tailed design did not show any loosening. Finite element analysis showed areas of stress concentration at the superior surface of the stems to 188. 8 MPa. This was well below the yield strength of titanium alloy of 897 MPa. Statistical analysis performed for specimens 1 to 4 to calculated lower tolerance bounds on cycles to failure, representing the estimated minimum achievable cycles to failure at 90, 95, and 99 % of the population at 90 and 95 % confidence levels, showed that the estimated mean cycles to failure was 10, 132 cycles at the mean, minimum and maximum loads of 120 N and 18. 4 N respectively. CONCLUSION: Good bony contact seems to be essential at the lower border for long-term survival of the reconstruction. Small gaps increase the bending forces and thus shear stresses at the stem. The new design of the modular endoprosthesis is prone to stress concentrations at the superior surface of the stems. This is accentuated by the sharp screw threads of the stems. The loosening of the module connection seemed to have been stopped with the dove-tailed design...|$|R
