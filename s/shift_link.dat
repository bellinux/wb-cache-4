40|$|Price: $ 30 - 264 pages This {{an ambitious}} and thought-provoking book that proposes a major {{hypothesis}} concerning {{the architecture of}} the language faculty, namely that asymmetric relations are basic in linguistic computation, and the only ones allowed in morphology (the Asymmetry Hypothesis), considered as an independent module of grammar. The author develops this hypothesis through a set of explicit assumptions, based on the framework of the Minimalist Program (Chomsky, 1995), and on her own Asymmetric Theory. From the former, she borrows a derivational model that takes lexical items and processes them to yield linguistic objects understandable at the auditory-articulatory and conceptual-intentional interfaces through an operation labeled Spell-out. From the latter, she assumes the existence of a multiplanar derivational model, where syntax and morphology are two independent components of grammar that work in parallel-even though each domain may interact with the other, a point which we will return to later-, with different requirements concerning the primitives, the specific implementation of generic operations, and the nature of interface representations. The book is clearly organized in eight chapters with concluding remarks. The first three chapters introduce the fundamental precepts of Asymmetry Theory, whose basic machinery and main empirical and theoretical consequences are developed in the subsequent chapters. Chapter 1 thus introduces us to the role of asymmetry in grammar, extending the basic insights of (Kayne, 1994); chapter 2 formulates the three generic rules of grammar, <b>Shift,</b> <b>Link,</b> and Flip; an...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} terrestrial radiations is the diversification of the flowering plants (Angiospermae) in the Cretaceous period. Early angiosperms {{appear to have been}} limited to disturbed, aquatic or extremely dry sites, suggesting that they were suppressed in most other places by the gymnosperms that still dominated the plant world. However, fossil evidence suggests {{that by the end of}} the Cretaceous the angiosperms had spectacularly taken over the dominant position from the gymnosperms around the globe. Here, we suggest an ecological explanation for their escape from their subordinate position relative to gymnosperms and ferns. We propose that angiosperms due to their higher growth rates profit more rapidly from increased nutrient supply than gymnosperms, whereas at the same time angiosperms promote soil nutrient release by producing litter that is more easily decomposed. This positive feedback may have resulted in a runaway process once angiosperms had reached a certain abundance. Evidence for the possibility of such a critical transition to angiosperm dominance comes from recent work on large scale vegetation <b>shifts,</b> <b>linking</b> long-term field observations, large scale experiments and the use of simulation models...|$|R

40|$|Printed {{literature}} and electronic literature, especially hypertexts, bring into play diverse issues {{of time and}} space. When approaching them, we should use different critical frameworks, at least in one respect: the analysis of a hypertext cannot forget considerations about time and space {{in the act of}} reading – or performing – the text. Hypertexts generate many different possible readings thanks to the changing and <b>shifting</b> <b>links</b> which move in hyperspace. Therefore, if in considering these issues in electronic literature we can obviously apply all the critical categories we use with printed works, here we cannot avoid considering the time and the space that are not “inside” the text but “outside” the text. This essay tries to explain the relationship between these external and internal time-space issues in electronic literature, how they interlink and mutually change, and how the act of reading both modifies and is modified by them. In particular, we will consider the web-based poetry When the Sea Stands Still (1997), by John Cayley and Yang Lian, and Rice (1998), by the artist known as Geniwate, basing the analysis on the studies by Espen Aarseth, Wolfgang Iser, Frank Kermode, Ted Nelson, and Edward Said. </p...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{monitoring}} {{revealed a}} regular decrease in herbicide concentration in Lake Geneva since last decades {{that may be}} linked to an ecotoxic restoration of nontarget phytoplanktonic communities. The Pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) approach was tested as a tool to monitor the ecotoxic restoration of Lake Geneva for herbicides from 1999 to 2011. We conducted monthly assessments in 1999 and in 2011 for the tolerance of the phytoplankton communities to two herbicides (atrazine and copper), using PICT bioassays. The taxonomical composition of the communities was determined on the same collecting dates. The herbicide concentration decrease during the 12 years significantly influenced the composition of communities. The PICT monitoring indicated that a significant tolerance decrease in the community to both herbicides accompanied the herbicide concentration decrease. PICT measurements for atrazine and copper also changed at the intra-annual level. These variations were mainly due to community composition <b>shifts</b> <b>linked</b> to seasonal phosphorus and temperature changes.

Recent decades have seen the rise of both community partnerships and the carceral state. Community policing in Los Angeles arose after the 1992 uprisings and was built on two conceptual building blocks—the territorial imperative and community partnership—which remain central more than 20 years later. At the same time, LA has undergone a significant black-to-Latino demographic <b>shift</b> <b>linked</b> with its restructured economy. This article discusses these changes using archival analysis and 5 years of participant observation in one South LA precinct. Police help to reshape the demography of South LA in ways conducive to post-Fordist economic shifts. The “community” concept appropriated by urban governance initiatives is composed against the unwanted “anticommunity,” which serves to heighten territorial control over black and Latino residents. Rather than encourage community cogovernance over the institution of policing, community rhetoric facilitates racial preference in neighborhood transition {{under the auspices of}} an increasingly bifurcated labor market.

40|$|On {{one night}} per year, at a {{specific}} point in the lunar cycle, {{one of the most}} extraordinary reproductive events on the planet unfolds as hundreds of millions of broadcast spawning corals release their trillions of gametes into the waters of the tropical seas. Each species spawns on a specific night within the lunar cycle, typically from full moon to third quarter moon, and in a specific time window after sunset. This accuracy is essential to achieve efficient fertilization in the vastness of the oceans. In this report, we use transcriptome sequencing at noon and midnight across an entire lunar cycle to explore how acroporid corals interpret lunar signals. The data were interrogated by both time-of-day-dependent and time-of-day-independent methods to identify different types of lunar cycles. Time-of-day methods found that genes associated with biological clocks and circadian processes change their diurnal cycles {{over the course of a}} synodic lunar cycle. Some genes have large differences between day and night at some lunar phases, but little or no diurnal differences at other phases.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{distinctive}} {{features of the}} critical agenda associated with the ‘Social Life of Methods’. I argue that although this perspective {{can be associated with}} the increasing interest, often associated with scholars in Science and Technology Studies, to reflect on how methods can become objects of inquiry, it also needs to be rooted in the current crisis of positivist methods. I identify the challenge for positivism in terms of the decreasing ability of its procedures to effectively organize increasingly ‘lively’ sources of standardized data, which can now be assembled using aesthetic registers. In developing this argument, I dispute the idea that this development is due to historical <b>shifts</b> <b>linked</b> to the way that methodological devices are playing an increasingly significant role in contemporary social life, which might be argued by writers such as Thrift or Castells. I also argue that by opening up issues of method to the aesthetic, we also recast the relationship between theory and method, pointing to the exhaustion of a certain kind of cultural theory within the social sciences. I contextualize these issues by considering how methods are implicated in the intellectual differentiation between scientific and humanities expertise. Rather than conceiving the ‘Social Life of Methods’ in terms of the rise of instrumentalist modes of governance, it is preferable to place it within the dialectic of transparency and the relationship between the implicit and explicit.

40|$|Trophic spectra {{represent}} {{the distribution of}} biomass, abundance, or catch by trophic level, and {{may be used as}} indicators of the trophic structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems in a fisheries context. As a theoretical background, we present a simple ecosystem model of biomass flow reflecting predation and ontogenetic processes. Biomass trophic spectrum of total biomass can be modelled as the result of three major factors and processes: trophic efficiency, transfer kinetics, and extent of top-down control. In the simulations, changes in the spectrum highlight fishing impacts on trophic structure and reveal some functional characteristics of the underlying ecosystem. As examples of potential applications, three case studies of trophic spectra are presented. Catch trophic spectra allow description of structural differences among European fishing areas and periods. Abundance trophic spectra of coral-reef fish assemblages display different trophic signatures, characterizing different reef habitats in New Caledonia and highlighting fishing effects in a marine protected area context. Biomass trophic spectra of demersal resources off Northwest Africa show a shift in ecosystem structure that {{can be attributed to the}} rapid increase in fishing pressure during the past few decades. Off Senegal, total biomass remained fairly constant, suggesting a strong top-down control linked to fisheries targeting high trophic level species. Off Guinea, exploitation rates are spread over a wider range of trophic levels, and the total biomass of demersal resources tended to decrease. The trophic spectrum is concluded to be a useful indicator describing and comparing systems in time and space, detecting phase <b>shifts</b> <b>linked</b> to natural or anthropogenic perturbations, and revealing differences in ecosystem functioning...|$|R

I will particularly focus on community development and media use and impact in neighbourhoods and local communities in the Netherlands. This paper is the first outline for a wider empirical researchproject being set up at Utrecht University of Applied Sciences on impact of media in neighbourhoods and on work of social professionals.. People in local settings like to use (social) media to be in contact with eachother. In many cities people can watch and listen to neighbourhood Radio and TV. Film and video are used to start dialogue and conversation between people with different cultural backgrounds. Young people make their own youtube films often not knowing what the destructive strength of images can be. For social workers media are tools to raise awareness on for instance alcohol abuse. Media can also make assets of local citizens visible, empower communities and give visibility and influence processes of community development. Civic journalism through websites and social media open windows to the world, enabling individuals and local groups to show who they are, what they do or whom {{they want to be}} both in a local and transnational settings. The economic and political crisis, the downsizing of the Welfaresystem and the withdrawal of the state with regard to the organization of social work lead to new forms of selforganization, self responsibility and social innovation.
