500|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} on Lee and LeFevre's On the Road to Freedom album in November 1973, and as the A-side of a single the following month. The album was critically well received, and Billboard included [...] "So Sad" [...] among its recommended singles for the week of 22 December 1973. Writing in Rolling Stone, Bud Scoppa paired the track with the Wood-composed [...] "Let 'Em Say What They Will" [...] as [...] "two non-originals [...] are beauties", adding: [...] "George Harrison's 'So Sad (No Love of His Own)' <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> {{one of his best}} songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Roddenberry said of Christianity, [...] "How can I {{take seriously}} a God-image that {{requires}} that I prostrate myself every seven days and praise it? That <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a very insecure personality." [...] At one point, he worked a similar opinion, {{which was to}} have been stated by a Vulcan, into the plot for Star Trek: The God Thing. Before his death, Roddenberry became close friends with philosopher Charles Musès, who said that Roddenberry's views were [...] "a far cry from atheism". Roddenberry explained his position thusly: [...] "It's not true that I don't believe in God. I believe in a kind of God. It's just not other people's God. I reject religion. I accept the notion of God." [...] He had an ongoing interest in other people's experiences with religion, and called Catholicism [...] "a very beautiful religion. An art form." [...] However, he said that he dismissed all organized religions, saying that for the most part, they acted like a [...] "substitute brain... and a very malfunctioning one". Roddenberry was also critical of how the public looked at certain religions, noting that when the King David Hotel bombing took place in 1946, the American public accepted it as the action of freedom fighters, whereas a car bombing by a Muslim in Beirut is condemned as a terrorist act. While he agreed that both parties were wrong in their use of violence, he said that the actions of both were undertaken because of their strong religious beliefs.|$|E
500|$|... "For June Bolan, {{the alarm}} bells began to sound only when Syd kept his girlfriend under {{lock and key}} for three days, {{occasionally}} shoving a ration of biscuits under the door." [...] A claim of cruelty against Barrett committed by the groupies and hangers-on who frequented his apartment during this period was described by writer and critic Jonathan Meades. [...] "I went [...] to see Harry and there was this terrible noise. It sounded like heating pipes shaking. I said, 'What's up?' and he sort of giggled and said, 'That's Syd having a bad trip. We put him in the linen cupboard'". Storm Thorgerson responded to this claim by stating [...] "I do not remember locking Syd up in a cupboard. It <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> pure fantasy, like Jonathan Meades was on dope himself." [...] Other friends assert that Barrett's infamous flatmates, [...] "Mad Jock" [...] and [...] "Mad Sue," [...] believed that acid held all the answers and thought of Barrett as a genius or [...] "god," [...] and were spiking his morning coffee with LSD every day without his knowledge, leaving him in a never-ending trip. He was later rescued from that flat by friends and moved elsewhere, but his erratic behavior continued. Watkinson and Anderson included quotes from a story told to them by Thorgerson that underscored how volatile Barrett could be. [...] "On one occasion, I had to pull him off Lindsay (Barrett's girlfriend at the time) because he was beating her over the head with a mandolin". On one occasion, Barrett threw a woman called Gilly across the room, because she refused to go to Gilmour's house. These strange behaviors contradicted Barrett's usually gentle nature. According to Gilmour in an interview with Nick Kent, the other members of Pink Floyd approached psychiatrist R. D. Laing with the 'Barrett problem'. After hearing a tape of a Barrett conversation, Laing declared him [...] "incurable".|$|E

6000|$|... "It <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the {{tones of}} an oracle--the whisperings of fancy--the very words of truth! It {{was a strange}} and persuasive voice!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Malladi {{currently}} {{resides in}} Denmark {{with her husband}} and two sons. She has said that [...] "When I first moved <b>to</b> Denmark... Danish <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the buzzing of bees".|$|R
2500|$|One {{composer}} Culshaw {{had nothing}} to do with was Mahler. He had a strong aversion to Mahler's music, writing that it made him feel sick: [...] "not metaphorically but physically sick. I find his strainings and heavings, juxtaposed with what always <b>sounds</b> (<b>to</b> <b>me)</b> <b>like</b> faux-naif music of the most calculated type, downright repulsive".|$|E
2500|$|On “Can You Learn,” {{which was}} {{originally}} {{going to be}} the title-track, T.I. and R. Kelly talk to the ladies from a different perspective: [...] "This record <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> what you would expect to hear if Tupac collaborated with Nate Dogg,” said T.I. of the DJ Montay-produced track, which was inspired by his own leading lady, Tameka [...] "Tiny" [...] Cottle. [...] "I really feel the connection between the music and the listener, especially if the listener is a lady or a gentleman who has had a lady who stuck by him through all of the ups and downs, the peaks and valleys that life has to offer. She’s proven herself to be a rider." ...|$|E
2500|$|Quinn’s {{argument}} against the obscenity charges was based upon claims that the prurient material in Ulysses was actually a deterrent rather than a pernicious influence. He made further arguments that one needed {{to be acquainted with}} the city of Dublin to truly understand the work and that the sporadic punctuation, and the perceived incomprehensibility of the novel, was due to Joyce’s poor eyesight. At one point in the trial Quinn confessed that [...] "I myself do not understand Ulysses—I think Joyce has carried his method too far,” whereupon one of the presiding judges replied, “Yes, it <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the ravings of a disordered mind—I can’t see why anyone would want to publish it".|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you could}} sleep," [...] said Sarah, [...] "you were more {{fortunate}} than Frances and myself; every murmur {{of the night}} air <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> {{the approach of the}} rebel army." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then it was I {{appealed to}} Doctor Warren, telling him we Minute Boys {{were eager to}} be up and doing, and that {{it seemed as if}} we might be of {{assistance}} as spies; but he cut short the conversation by saying in what <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> an odd tone: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are to have}} {{a meeting}} to-night at the old ship-yard, near to Luke Wright's home," [...] Archie said, evidently {{thinking}} we had {{spent too much time}} over the gaining of this one recruit, and as we hurried away Seth cried, in what <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> an odd tone: ...|$|R
2500|$|New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said, [...] "it <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> {{excessive}} force was used," [...] {{and called the}} shooting [...] "inexplicable" [...] and [...] "unacceptable". Ex-New York State governor George E. Pataki also stated that he thought the shooting was excessive. NYC police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, has put the five officers involved on paid administrative leave and stripped them of their weapons, a move the New York Times called [...] "forceful". [...] He told the Times that the officers were stripped of their guns because [...] "there were, and are, too many unanswered questions". Both Bloomberg and Kelly have {{also noted that the}} shooting was possibly in violation of department guidelines prohibiting shooting at a moving vehicle, even if the vehicle is being used as a weapon. [...] The Public Advocate extended condolences to Bell's former fiancée and family following the killing.|$|E
2500|$|Speculation has {{sometimes}} focused on Rosario, Hedgepeth's roommate at the time, {{due to her}} 9-1-1 call, the last texts sent from Hedgepeth's phone to her former boyfriend suggesting [...] " [...] needs you more than you know", the woman addressed as [...] "Rosie" [...] on the voicemail conversation and her decision to leave the apartment unlocked with, she claims, a sleeping Hedgepeth inside, to go sleep somewhere else at 4:30 {{the morning of the}} killing. Although she has left North Carolina and said very little about the case since then, Gasparoli wrote in 2017 that he learned from his police sources that they still regularly speak with her, and she cooperates. [...] "They do believe there is more Rosario can tell them," [...] he says. [...] " [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> [...] has been in the crosshairs ... as a key figure who knows more than she says she knows." ...|$|E
6000|$|Kate stoutly confronted him. [...] "Perhaps {{the fame}} {{you give her}} will destroy her. It <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> notoriety rather than fame. This poor child {{has a right to}} herself, and I will help her assert it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The words [...] "too late," [...] <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the doom of fate; and had my simple-minded {{companion}} but the tithe of {{the observation}} which he so much vaunted, he must have seen my agitation. I had advanced so far, however, that I determined to learn the worst, whatever pain it might cost me.|$|R
25|$|The Felt {{theory was}} a strong one... Felt had a {{personal}} motive for acting. After the death of J. Edgar Hoover... Felt {{thought he was a}} leading candidate to succeed Hoover... The characteristics were a good fit. The trouble with Felt's candidacy was that Deep Throat in All the President's Men simply did not <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a career FBI man.|$|R
6000|$|I {{learned this}} fact {{now for the}} first time; but, with Mrs. Makely's warning eye upon me, I could not say so, and I made what <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a Gothic murmur of acquiescence. It sufficed for Mrs. Makely's purpose, at any rate, and she went on, without giving the Altrurian a chance to say what he thought the {{educational}} effect of wall-paper would be: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What in hell is {{this fellow}} driving at, Paret?" [...] he demanded. [...] "It <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the ranting of a lunatic dervish. If he thinks so much of us, {{and the way we}} run the town, what's he squawking about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I do not {{understand}} you there!" [...] the other man exclaimed. [...] "What you say <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a reflection upon the honour of your country. Do you mean to insinuate that she would possibly--that she would ever for a moment contemplate breaking her pledged and sealed word?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Thomas, [...] "this <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> an {{illustrated}} post-card from South Boston with 'We're {{having a good}} time here' written on it. I don't know the game. Is this ten thousand dollars money, or do I have to save so many coupons to get it?" ...|$|E
60|$|L. That <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> more <b>like</b> three {{questions}} than one, Mary. If {{it is only}} one, it is a wide one.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, that squares with {{something}} I once heard," [...] cried Walt Baxter. [...] "I met Professor Duke {{down at the}} barn one day where he was waiting to have Nixon drive him down to town. The professor was walking around, wringing his hands and muttering to himself. He looked all out of sorts, and he said something that <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> 'I don't see how I can do it! I don't see how I can really attempt it!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Mousie,' says Bill, 'the {{hole in the}} wainscoting for yours. Your dogmas and inculcations <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> {{the last}} words of a bicycle pump. What has your high moral, elevator-service system of pillage brought you to? Penuriousness and want. Even Brother Peters, who insists upon contaminating the art of robbery with {{theories}} of commerce and trade, admitted {{he was on the}} lift. Both of you live by the gilded rule. Brother Peters,' says Bill, 'you'd better choose a slice of this embalmed currency. You're welcome.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lewis said to me, 'Why do {{you talk}} 'Venetian' (such as I could [...] talk, not very fine to be sure) to the Venetians, and not the usual [...] Italian?' I answered, partly from habit and partly to be understood, [...] if possible. 'It may be so,' said Lewis, 'but it <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> [...] talking with a 'brogue' to an Irishman.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a word {{more to be}} spoken!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "There's more {{behind this}} scheme of Maraton's than he's willing to have us understand! It looks to me and it <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a piece of dirty, underhand business. I'll ask you a question, Maraton. Were you at the Ritz Hotel one night about two months ago, with the {{ambassador}} of a foreign a country?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to hear the lake-view {{connected}} with anything so horrible as the idea of murder," [...] she said. [...] "And if Count Fosco must divide murderers into classes, I think {{he has been very}} unfortunate in his choice of expressions. To describe them as fools only seems like treating them with an indulgence to which they have no claim. And to describe them as wise men <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a downright contradiction in terms. I have always heard that truly wise men are truly good men, and have a horror of crime." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you minded to stop here, lad?" [...] I {{asked in}} a low tone, and he replied with what <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> much <b>like</b> an odd {{inflection}} of the voice: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't {{say that}} I know exactly," [...] the latter answered, [...] "but I guess we'll {{find out where}} that cry came from. <b>Sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> uncommonly <b>like</b> a human effort." ...|$|R
60|$|An ear {{for music}} is a very {{different}} thing from a taste for music. I have no ear whatever; I could not sing an air to save my life; but I have the intensest delight in music, and can detect good from bad. Naldi, a good fellow, remarked <b>to</b> <b>me</b> once at a concert, that I did not seem much interested with a piece of Rossini's which had just been performed. I said, it <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> nonsense verses. But I could scarcely contain myself when a thing of Beethoven's followed.|$|R
60|$|I fear I {{was born}} a parson; but I live very near upon the margin (though, by your leave, I may outlive you all!), and too much rigour in these daily things <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> clatter on the kitchen dishes. If it might be--could it not be smoothed? This very day my father writes me he has gone to see, upon his deathbed, an old friend to whom for years he has not spoken or written. On his deathbed; no picking up of the lost stitches; merely to say: my little fury, my spotted uprightness, after having split our lives, have not a word of quarrel to say more. And the same post brings me the news of another--War! Things in this troubled medium are not so clear, dear Henley; there are faults upon all hands; and the end comes, and Ferrier's grave gapes for us all.|$|E
6000|$|WISE MAN [turning {{over the}} pages of a book]. Where is that passage I am to explain to my pupils to-day? Here it is, and the book says that it was written by a beggar on the walls of Babylon: [...] "There are two living countries, the one visible and the one invisible; and when it is winter with us it is summer in that country; and when the November winds are up among us it is lambing-time there." [...] I wish that my pupils had asked me to explain any other passage, for this is a hard passage. [The FOOL comes in and stands at the door, holding out his hat. He has a pair of shears in the other hand.] It <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> foolishness; and yet that cannot be, for the writer of this book, where I have found so much knowledge, would not have set it by itself on this page, and {{surrounded}} it with so many images and so many deep colors and so much fine gilding, if it had been foolishness.|$|E
60|$|Let us {{get back}} to that tent with its songs and cheery conversation. Courage. I do not think it is to be got by your {{becoming}} solemn-sides before your time. You must have been warned against letting the golden hours slip by. Yes, but some of them are golden only because we let them slip. Diligence--ambition; noble words, but only if 'touched to fine issues.' Prizes may be dross, learning lumber, unless they bring you into the arena with increased understanding. Hanker not too much after worldly prosperity--that corpulent cigar; if you became a millionaire you would probably go swimming around for more like a diseased goldfish. Look to it that what you are doing is not merely toddling to a competency. Perhaps that must be your fate, but fight it and then, though you fail, you may still be among the elect of whom we have spoken. Many a brave man has had to come to it at last. But there are the complacent toddlers from the start. Favour them not, ladies, especially now that every one of you carries a possible marechal's baton under her gown. 'Happy,' it has been said by a distinguished man, 'is he who can leave college with an unreproaching conscience and an unsullied heart.' I don't know; he <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a sloppy, watery sort of fellow; happy, perhaps, but if there be red blood in him impossible. Be not disheartened by ideals of perfection which can be achieved only by those who run away. Nature, that 'thrifty goddess,' never gave you 'the smallest scruple of her excellence' for that. Whatever bludgeonings may be gathering for you, I think one feels more poignantly at your age than ever again in life. You have not our December roses to help you; but you have June coming, whose roses do not wonder, as do ours even while they give us their fragrance--wondering most when they give us most--that we should linger on an empty scene. It may indeed be monstrous but possibly courageous.|$|E
60|$|Thus ended Sir Fredericks story, whose tale <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> {{one told}} in a vision; and I could hardly {{bring myself to}} believe that I saw his daughter's form once more before me in flesh and blood, though with diminished beauty and sunk spirits. The buoyant vivacity with which she had {{resisted}} every touch of adversity, had now assumed the air of composed and submissive, but dauntless resolution and constancy. Her father, though aware and jealous {{of the effect of}} her praises on my mind, could not forbear expatiating upon them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rosy, dear," [...] {{said the}} worthy relict, {{as soon as}} she saw Mulford stretch his fine frame on his bed of canvas, {{speaking}} {{at the same time in}} a low, confidential tone to her niece, [...] "what was it that Harry was telling you a little while ago? It <b>sounded</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> rank nonsense; and men will talk nonsense to young girls, as I have so often warned you, child. You must never listen to their nonsense, Rosy; but remember your catechism and confirmation vow, and be a good girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{ranch in}} Texas," [...] sighed Aunt Ellen. [...] "It <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> more <b>like</b> a {{liability}} than an asset. Those are {{the places where}} the centipedes are found, and cowboys, and fandangos." ...|$|R
