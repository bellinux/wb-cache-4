40|$|Abstract. In {{the last}} twenty years, {{numerous}} researches have been devoted throughout Europe to the behaviour of semi-rigid and partial-strength joints in steel structures. These efforts progressively led to the publication of normative documents, design recommendation and guidelines and {{to the development of}} various design tools for practitioners. On the contrary rather little {{attention has been paid to}} the design of <b>simple</b> <b>joints.</b> In this paper, design recommendations for such joints are presented. They result from deep comparative studies of existing national codes and extensive discussions within the Technical Committee 10 « Connections » of the European Convention for constructional Steelwork (ECCS). The publication of this material as “European recommendations for the design of <b>simple</b> <b>joints</b> in steel structures ” should be achieved in 2008. ...|$|R

50|$|The nasal {{is short}} and broad like Mei, and bears a row of {{foramina}} like other troodontids. Also like other troodontids, the frontal curves backwards smoothly on the outer margin which borders the eye socket. On {{the bottom of the}} bone, there is a prominent ridge known as the crista cranium, which diverges gradually from the rim of the eye socket towards the midline {{of the back of the}} bone. The front tip of the ridge contacts the lacrimal, with a relatively <b>simple</b> <b>joint</b> unlike that of Troodon. The inner surface of the frontal suggests details about the braincase, including the widened olfactory tract and back of the cerebrum. Like other troodontids, there is a ridge on the forward-projecting branch of the jugal. Also like other troodontids, there is a depression on the short and deep backward-projecting process, where the bone is overlapped by the quadratojugal. The subtriangular and curved backward branch of the quadrate, which articulates with the pterygoid, is located closer to the bottom of the bone than in most other theropods. Compared to Sinovenator, the long jugal branch of the postorbital is not as long.|$|E

40|$|Welding is {{a widely}} used method of {{connecting}} components because of its efficiency, great value and almost endless possibilities of join types. A great variability of geometrical configurations of welds is problematic due to {{the assessment of the}} weld joint. Depending on this topic this thesis was focused on the assessment of weld joints statically and cyclically. Work in the first part deals with the search of methods for evaluation of welds and depending on identified options is subsequently selected American standard AISC assessment of welded joints. The method is applied into FEA analysis and <b>simple</b> welded <b>joints</b> are evaluated. Using FEM are computed three examples on which a comparative analysis was performed. Comparisons were made with the analytical solution based on changes in the parameters of the computational model. The change is primarily related to material properties, mesh size and division of the weld on segments. On the basis of knowledge from analysis of <b>simple</b> <b>joints,</b> method was extended to more general welded joints with the possibility of determining the maximum loading force...|$|R
2500|$|A {{butt joint}} is a {{technique}} in which two pieces of wood [...] are joined by simply placing their ends together without any special shaping. The name 'butt joint' comes {{from the way the}} wood is joint together. The butt <b>joint</b> is the <b>simplest</b> <b>joint</b> to make since it merely involves cutting the wood [...] to the appropriate length and [...] butting them together. It is also the weakest because unless some form of reinforcement is used (see below) it relies upon glue alone to hold it together. Because the orientation of the wood usually presents only one end to long grain gluing surface, the resulting joint is inherently weak.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} biochemical {{predictors of}} spinal bone mineral {{growth and the}} development of spinal osteoporosis in children with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) treated with glucocorticoids. METHODS: Bone mass measurements were made at 3 monthly intervals for one year in 31 children. At each visit, blood and urine were obtained for assessment of laboratory indices related to the acute phase response and bone remodelling rates. Assessments were also made of joint inflammation (<b>simple</b> <b>joint</b> count). RESULTS: Plasma albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations contributed independently of height velocity to the prediction of lumbar spinal bone mineral growth, but only when averaged over the year of observation. The <b>simple</b> <b>joint</b> count did not usefully predict spinal bone mineral changes in the individual patient, nor did any measured index normally related to bone turnover (plasma osteocalcin, 25 (OH) vitamin D, urinary hydroxyproline). Mean values of the <b>simple</b> <b>joint</b> count were predicted by mean CRP and CRP trends. Joint count trends were predicted by hemoglobin trends. None of these relationships, although statistically significant, was strong enough to predict individual outcomes precisely. CONCLUSIONS: Failure of spinal bone mineral growth is related to failure of growth in height and weight but also to biochemical markers for the activation of the acute phase response. Failure of bone growth to correlate with increased hydroxyprolinuria or plasma osteocalcin concentrations may be attributed to the confounding effect of glucocorticoid treatment on plasma osteocalcin levels in children whose bone resorption is little changed from normal levels despite their reduced growth. Biochemical measurements are weak substitutes for bone densitometry in monitoring spinal growth in these children...|$|E

40|$|This Thesis {{is about}} the {{application}} of Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) {{to the study of}} noise and vibration in motor vehicles. Methods for predicting the transmission of structural waves between body panels in motor cars are given. A complex joint technique based on the wave dynamic stiffness approach is discussed in detail. This technique can account for the complexities of the joint structures found in motor vehicles. Transmission of vibration energy between panels connected by a curved section of panel has been investigated using the complex joint modelling technique. Wave Intensity Analysis(WIA) and SEA were used to calculate the coupled panel vibration levels based on transmission coefficients calculated using the complex joint techniques. Energy Level Differences (ELDs) were measured for comparison with predicted results using laboratory models. SEA failed to accurately predict the ELDs except at low frequencies. However WIA was able to predicted the ELDs with reasonable accuracy using an existing expression for transmission at a panel corner joint. Two SEA models of a small passenger car have also been constructed. One assumes <b>simpler</b> <b>joint</b> configurations when calculating transmission coefficients and the other uses the complex joint technique. Panel ELDs were measured using a small passenger car. The SEA model using the complex joint method gives better agreement with measured ELDs than did the model using the <b>simpler</b> <b>joints.</b> saloon Sound Pressure Level (SPL) as a result of engine noise was measured. Both SEA models of the vehicle gave good agreement between measured and predicted Saloon SPL. A noise problem associated with exhaust misalignment is also investigated.
