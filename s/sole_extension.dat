40|$|AbstractTransmembrane receptors are {{integral}} components of sensory pathways in prokaryotes. These receptors {{share a common}} dimeric architecture, consisting in its basic form of an N-terminal extracellular sensor, transmembrane helices, and an intracellular effector. As an exception, we have identified an archaeal receptor family—exemplified by Af 1503 from Archaeoglobus fulgidus—that is C-terminally shortened, lacking a recognizable effector module. Instead, a HAMP domain forms the <b>sole</b> <b>extension</b> for signal transduction in the cytosol. Here, we examine the gene environment of Af 1503 -like receptors and find a frequent association with transmembrane transport proteins. Furthermore, we identify and define a closely associated new protein domain family, which we characterize structurally using Af 1502 from A. fulgidus. Members of this family are found both as stand-alone proteins and as domains within extant receptors. In general, the latter appear as connectors between the solute carrier 5 (SLC 5) –like transmembrane domains and two-component signal transduction (TCST) domains. This is seen, for example, in the histidine kinase CbrA, which is a global regulator of metabolism, virulence, and antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonads. We propose that this newly identified domain family mediates signal transduction in systems regulating transport processes and name it STAC, for SLC and TCST-Associated Component...|$|E
5000|$|Ski {{bindings}} {{evolved from}} the cable binding system of the 1950s, which looped around behind the boot and {{over the back of}} the sole. Many boots of the 1950s and 60s included a semi-circular indentation in the sole to provide a better fit for the cable. Early releasing bindings were designed to fit into this groove or over the sole, like a cable, often using a metal roller about the same size as the cable, the Look Nevada's [...] "Gran Prix" [...] release heel being a typical example. When plastic boots were introduced, they too provided similar <b>sole</b> <b>extensions</b> for mounting the bindings.|$|R
40|$|As {{of today}} the {{programming}} {{language of the}} vast majority of the published source code is manually specified or programmatically assigned based on the <b>sole</b> file <b>extension.</b> In this paper we show that the source code programming language identification task can be fully automated using machine learning techniques. We first define the criteria that a production-level automatic programming language identification solution should meet. Our criteria include accuracy, programming language coverage, extensibility and performance. We then describe our approach: How training files are preprocessed for extracting features that mimic grammar productions, and then how these extracted grammar productions are used for the training and testing of our classifier. We achieve a 99 percent accuracy rate while classifying 29 of the most popular programming languages with a Maximum Entropy classifier. Comment: 13 pages, 4 tables, 4 example...|$|R
60|$|Johnny's friends {{stood by}} him loyally. On {{the first day}} Keogh strolled into the store in a casual kind of way about once every hour, and bought shoes. After he had {{purchased}} a pair each of <b>extension</b> <b>soles,</b> congress gaiters, button kids, low-quartered calfs, dancing pumps, rubber boots, tans of various hues, tennis shoes and flowered slippers, he sought out Johnny to be prompted as to the names of other kinds that he might inquire for. The other English-speaking residents also played their parts nobly by buying often and liberally. Keogh was grand marshal, and made them distribute their patronage, thus keeping up a fair run of custom for several days.|$|R
40|$|The phase-variable locus lex 2 is {{required}} for expression of a Haemophilus influenzae lipopolysaccharide (LPS) epitope of previously unknown structure. This epitope, which is reactive with monoclonal antibody (MAb) 5 G 8, {{has been associated with}} virulence of type b strains. When strain RM 118 (from the same source as strain Rd), in which the lex 2 locus and MAb 5 G 8 reactivity are absent, was transformed with lex 2 DNA, transformants that were reactive with MAb 5 G 8 were obtained. Surprisingly, the 5 G 8 reactivity of these transformants was phase variable, although the lex 2 locus lacked tetrameric repeats and was constitutively expressed. This phase variation was shown {{to be the result of}} phase-variable expression of phosphorylcholine (PCho) such that MAb 5 G 8 reacted only in the absence of PCho. Structural analysis showed that, compared to RM 118, the lex 2 transformant had acquired a tetrasaccharide, Gal- 1, 4 -Gal- 1, 4 -Glc- 1, 4 -Glc- 1, 4, linked to the proximal heptose (HepI). A terminal GalNAc was detected in a minority of glycoforms. LPS derived from a mutant of RM 7004, a virulent type b strain which naturally expresses lex 2 and has LPS containing the same tetrasaccharide linked to HepI as the <b>sole</b> oligosaccharide <b>extension</b> from the inner core, confirmed that GalNAc is not a part of the MAb 5 G 8 -reactive epitope. Thus, MAb 5 G 8 specifically binds to the structure Gal- 1, 4 -Gal- 1, 4 -Glc- 1, 4 Glc- attached via a 1, 4 linkage to HepI of H. influenzae LPS, and we show that the ability to synthesize this novel tetrasaccharide was associated with enhanced bacterial resistance to complement-mediated killing...|$|R
