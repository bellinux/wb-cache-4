5|$|A Tarbosaurus skull {{found in}} 1948 by <b>Soviet</b> <b>and</b> Mongolian {{scientists}} (PIN 553-1, originally called Gorgosaurus lancinator) included the skull cavity {{that held the}} brain. Making a plaster cast, called an endocast, of the inside of this cavity allowed Maleev to make preliminary observations about {{the shape of a}} Tarbosaurus brain. A newer polyurethane rubber cast allowed a more detailed study of Tarbosaurus brain structure and function.|$|E
5|$|As Brezhnev {{replaced}} Khrushchev {{as the new}} General Secretary of the Communist Party, he held ultimate {{political authority}} {{as the leader of}} the Soviet Union. However, he shared collective leadership with Nikolai Podgorny (the Chairman of the Supreme <b>Soviet</b> <b>and</b> nominal head of state) and Alexsei Kosygin, the Premier. Brezhnev soon would maximize his grip on power and would be the dominating authority in the collective leadership.|$|E
5|$|Human rights {{organizations}} documented a wide number {{of human rights}} violations and abuses committed by <b>Soviet</b> <b>and</b> Azerbaijani forces. These included forced deportations of civilians, unlawful killings, torture, kidnapping harassment, rape and the wanton seizure or destruction of property. Despite fierce protests, no measures were taken either to prevent the human rights abuses or to punish the perpetrators. Approximately 17,000 Armenians living in twenty-three of Shahumyan's villages were deported out of the region.|$|E

In 1964, ESRO was established as a Western European reaction to the rapidly developing <b>Soviet</b> <b>and</b> American space programs.

However, Norwegian space research scientists participated in ESRO programs.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{small amounts}} of {{rutherfordium}} were produced in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in the former Soviet Union and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. The priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between <b>Soviet</b> <b>and</b> American scientists, {{and it was not}} until 1997 that International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established rutherfordium as the official name for the element.|$|E
5|$|In the film, Stromberg's {{scheme to}} destroy {{civilisation}} by capturing <b>Soviet</b> <b>and</b> British nuclear submarines {{and have them}} fire intercontinental ballistic missiles at two major cities is actually a recycled plot from Gilbert's previous Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which involved stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the Americans. The similarity was apparent in the climax; both films involved an assault on a heavily fortified enemy that had taken refuge behind steel shutters.|$|E

5|$|Kaganovichs radar suite is unknown, but it {{is likely}} she was {{equipped}} {{with a mix of}} <b>Soviet</b> <b>and</b> British and American Lend-Lease radars.

5|$|After Soviet units {{completed}} the {{operation in the}} towns, they ordered a full-scale deportation of all resident Armenians in the two towns, helicoptering them to Nagorno-Karabakh's capital, Stepanakert, and later to Armenia proper. Supplanting the previous occupants were Azerbaijani refugees who had fled from Armenia to Azerbaijan during the previous three years of fighting. Initial public outcry denounced the launching of the operation as the <b>Soviet</b> <b>and</b> Azerbaijani governments went on to defend it, stating that the villagers of Shahumyan were providing aid and harboring the militias in their homes. The Armenian government, along with the Soviet media, including Pravda and the Moskovskiye Novosti, condemned the operation and described the acts of violence {{carried out by the}} army and OMON as excessive and unnecessary; the operation continued until the first week of May.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{becoming}} a naturalized American citizen in 1916, Raymond became the honorary consul for the Czechoslovak Republic, representing {{the government of}} T. G. Masaryk. This gave him influence outside those circles normally associated with an architect of his age. From 1928 to 1930, Raymond designed and remodelled the American, <b>Soviet</b> <b>and</b> French embassies. He also undertook work for the Rising Sun Petroleum Company, designing 17 earthquake-proof and fireproof employee houses, the general office building, the manager's residence and two prototype service stations, one in steel {{and the other in}} concrete. All were constructed in an International Modern Style.|$|E

5|$|During {{the same}} period, the North Vietnamese were {{recovering}} from losses incurred during the Easter Offensive of 1972 by replacing personnel and modernizing their equipment. Weapons improvement {{was due to}} a new influx of <b>Soviet</b> <b>and</b> Chinese military aid. During 1973, North Vietnam received 2.8million metric tons of goods (worth $330million) from communist-bloc countries, a 50 {{percent increase over the}} previous year. In 1974 that total increased to 3.5million metric tons ($400million) (according to CIA), while the South's aid was slashed to only $965 million per year, down from $2.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|Early on, many barracks at Birkenau {{were taken}} apart by civilians {{who used the}} {{materials}} to rebuild their own homes, levelled out {{in the construction of}} Auschwitz II. The poorest residents sifted the crematoria ashes in search of nuggets from melted gold, before the warning shots were fired. The POW camp for the German prisoners of war was used by the Soviet NKVD until 1947. In the two years, the Soviets dismantled and exported the IG Farben factories to the USSR. Meanwhile, <b>Soviet</b> <b>and</b> Polish investigators worked to document the war crimes of the SS.|$|E
5|$|However, {{contrary}} to their stated objectives, Soviet {{troops and the}} predominantly Azerbaijani soldiers in the AzSSR OMON and army forcibly uprooted Armenians living in the 24 villages strewn across Shahumyan {{to leave their homes}} and settle elsewhere in Nagorno-Karabakh or in the neighboring Armenian SSR. British journalist Thomas de Waal has described Ring as the Soviet Union's first and only civil war. Some authors have also described the actions of the joint <b>Soviet</b> <b>and</b> Azerbaijani force as ethnic cleansing. The military operation was accompanied by systematic and gross human rights abuses.|$|E

The following year, Canada implemented a national team program, led by Father David Bauer. Canada would not win another world championship gold until 1994. In 1962, the World Championships were held in North America for the first time. The tournament was held in Denver, United States, and was boycotted by the <b>Soviet</b> <b>and</b> Czechoslovak teams.

5|$|In February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania, while Western Allies entered western Germany {{and closed}} to the Rhine river.

In early April, the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg, while <b>Soviet</b> <b>and</b> Polish forces stormed Berlin in late April. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April. On 30 April 1945, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany.|$|E
