25|$|For the Norton Bavant Chalk Downland Edge, the 'character' of {{this area}} {{encompasses}} three distinctive, steeply sloping hills (Middle Hill, Scratchbury Hill, and Cotley Hill), which form a distinct and somewhat isolated unit of Chalk Downland Edge. The hills are covered with long fields, which are predominantly arable, with occasional patches of rough remnant chalk grassland and scrub situated {{on the top of}} the hills. Many chalk grassland slopes in England show the mark of centuries of grazing by sheep, the slopes bearing a stepped or striped appearance formed by a mixture of <b>soil</b> <b>creep</b> and sheep paths, and such erosion is visible on the slopes of Scratchbury Hill. Regular patches and belts of mixed woodland populate parts of the lower slopes. Imber military range perimeter paths run across the top of the hills, providing public access to the area.|$|E

Despite the {{importance}} of these processes as hazards and in sculpting landscapes, there is no agreed upon model that captures the full range of behavior. Here we examine the physical origins of hillslope soil transport by granular simulations, and re-analysis of measurements in natural landscapes. We find creep for slopes below a critical gradient, where average particle velocity (sediment flux) increases exponentially with friction coefficient (gradient). At critical there is a continuous transition to a dense-granular flow rheology, consistent with previous laboratory experiments. Slow earthflows and landslides thus exhibit glassy dynamics characteristic {{of a wide range of}} disordered materials; they are described by a two-phase flux equation that emerges from grain-scale friction alone. This glassy model reproduces topographic profiles of natural hillslopes, showing its promise for predicting hillslope evolution over geologic timescales...|$|R

The majority of this landscape are found along coastal barangays of San Luis, Ditumabo, L. Pimentel, Real, and Dibalo. These are categorized severely dissected high volcanic and metamorphic hills with rolling to very steep slopes. The foothill landscape was formed through volcanic uplift and subsequent tensional forces and compression whose surface configuration has eventually been carried out by erosion, landslide, rock fall faulting folding <b>soil</b> <b>creeping</b> and deepening of water channels. The elevation ranges from 50 to 500 meters above sea level. It was a mixed lithology of four (4) different rocks formation dated from Miocene to Recent. These are the Oligocene-Miocene (NI), Basement Complex (BC), Meta-volcanic (Kv), undifferentiated (Kpg), Cretaceous Paleocene (Ue), and Recent. Igneous and metamorphic rocks dominate the rocks formation and with composition that includes basalt, gabbro, ultrabasic, volcanic breccia, greywackes, peridotite, andesitic lava, metamorphosed shale, quarts, feldspar, slate, amphibolite, and phyllite.|$|R

40|$|The {{calculation}} of the consolidation settlement of clayey <b>soils</b> with <b>creep</b> behaviour has been a challenging issue with a long history. After a brief review the assumptions made in the two methods based on Hypothesis A and Hypothesis B, the authors present a new simplified hypothesis B method for {{calculation of}} consolidation settlement of a clayey <b>soil</b> with <b>creep.</b> Equations of this method are derived based on the “equivalent time” concept for different stress–strain states. This simplified Hypothesis B method is then {{used to calculate the}} consolidation settlement of a number of typical consolidation problems. The approximation and verification of this simplified method are examined by comparing the calculated settlements with settlements computed using two fully coupled finite element (FE) consolidation analysis programs using elastic viscoplastic (EVP) constitutive models (Hypothesis B) and the Hypothesis A method. It is found that the curves calculated using the new Hypothesis B simplified method with a factor α = 0. 8 are close to curves from two FE model simulations with relative errors in the range 0. 37 %~ 8. 42 % only for three layers of Hong Kong marine clay (HKMC). In overall, the settlements calculated using Hypothesis A method are smaller than those from the two FE simulations with relative error in the range 6. 52 %~ 46. 17 % for the three layers of HKMC. In addition, this new simplified Hypothesis B method is used to calculate the average strain of consolidation tests done by Berre and Iversen in 1972. The calculated results are compared with the test data, and values from a fully coupled finite difference (FD) consolidation analysis using Yin and Graham’s EVP constitutive model (Hypothesis B), and Hypothesis A method. It is found that, again, the results from the new simplified Hypothesis B method are very close to the measured data.

The newly exposed in situ soil slopes along National Highway- 40 {{are on the verge}} of shear instability, and slope failures occur due to heavy earth cuttings. As a consequence, the road corridor witnesses several geotechnical failures during rainy seasons. The blasting activities initiated and propagated the <b>soil</b> <b>creeps</b> and falls resulting road blockades. Even a small rain shower is enough to undercut and uproot trees and transport boulders and surrounding earth materials up to the corridor.

Therefore, the present study is aimed to investigate the stability of the hill cut soil slopes and to suggest possible stabilisation measures. The study also highlighted that steep soil slopes with high moisture content are prone to landslides mainly due to infiltration, and water flows on the slopes during high and prolonged rainfall. The highly plastic soils rich in silt and clay size particles with high moisture content cause soil/debris slide and flow. The numerical modelling of slopes using Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC) codes (version 4. 0) indicates failures in excavated high angle cut slopes.

For this reason {{should be developed}} an effective warning system of the main pipelines‘  failures and accidents not only in design and operation but also in selected repair. Changing of linear, unloaded by bending position leads to the change of stress and strain state of pipelines.

The article presents mathematical model of pipeline’s section straining in viscoelastic setting taking into account <b>soils</b> <b>creep</b> and high-speed stress state of pipeline with the purpose of stresses evaluation and load-supporting capacity of repairing section of pipeline, depending on time.  Stress and strain state analysis of pipeline includes longitudinal and circular stresses calculation  with  account of axis-asymmetrical straining and  was  fulfilled  on  the base of momentless theory of shells. To prove the consistency of data there were compared the calcu- lation results and the solution results by analytical methods for different cases (long pipeline’s section strain only under influence of cross-axis action; long pipeline’s section strain under in- fluence of longitudinal stress; long pipeline’s section strain; which is on the elastic foundation, under influence of cross-axis action).

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. An experimental program was conducted to study the penetration behavior of mines in soft sediment. Model tests were conducted on sediments collected from the Gulf of Mexico seabed. The size of the model mine was approximately one third of that of actual mines. The factors selected for the investigation were mine weight, preburial condition of the mine, mine orientation, impact velocity of the mine and shear strength and creep characteristics of the soil. Only the geotechnical aspects of the problem were investigated. The model tests were divided into nonimpact and impact tests. In the nonimpact tests, the mine penetration behavior qualitatively follows the theoretical predictions of pipe penetration. Normalized mine weight vs. normalized penetration curve has a steeper slope when the penetration is less than one mine radius. When the penetration is more than one mine radius the mine tends to penetrate more readily with increasing mine weight. The preburial condition of the mine does not influence the penetration behavior, especially for long term penetration. Mine orientation plays a role in immediate penetration, but when the mine is in full contact with the soil, it does not influence penetration significantly. Creep behavior of the Gulf of Mexico soil was found to be of a terminating nature, which contributes significantly to long term penetration. In impact tests, the impact velocity of the mine plays the most important role in mine penetration. The acceleration induced in the mine due to free fall becomes negative after some amount of penetration. The mine gains ultimate penetration immediately after hitting the mud and does not penetrate further as time passes. So, <b>soil</b> <b>creeping</b> does not contribute to penetration when the mine is being impacted on sediment...|$|R
