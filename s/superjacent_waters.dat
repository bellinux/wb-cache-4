5000|$|Article 1 of the {{convention}} defined the term shelf in terms of exploitability rather than relying upon the geological definition. It defined a shelf [...] "to the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas adjacent to the coast but outside {{the area of the}} territorial sea, to a depth of 200 meters or, beyond that limit, to where the depth of the <b>superjacent</b> <b>waters</b> admits of the exploitation of the natural resources of the said areas" [...] or [...] "to the seabed and subsoil of similar submarine areas adjacent to the coasts of islands".|$|E
40|$|Shebandowan Lakes, Ontario, are {{the site}} of at least 49 shallow (2 - 12 m) {{ferromanganese}} concretion deposits, widely distributed throughout the 48 km of the watercourse. X-ray diffraction and Mossbauer methods have revealed the presence of goethite {{in some of the}} concretions. Chemical analyses of the acid soluble portions of 72 samples gave an average composition of 43. 1 % Fe and 5. 65 % Mn with a low content of trace elements. The Shebandowan concretions are among the richest in iron of lake concretions reported, possibly because only the acid soluble portion was analysed. Their low content of trace elements suggests rapid growth rates and a relatively young age. A positive correlation was found between Mn and K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Ni, and Co and the relationship between the last three and Mn was deemed significant. Zn was independent of association with either Mn and Fe, probably due to the presence locally of zinc sulphide deposits. Analyses of lake bottom and influent waters suggested that frequent resampling of the sites would be required throughout the year to permit meaningful interpretation of the effect of water composition of concretions. Analyses of sediment cores from 20 concretion sites indicated an upward increase in Fe and Mn and in the Mn/Fe ratio, consistent with the model of upward migration of the elements, where Mn is more mobile than Fe. This study concludes that a considerable proportion of the elements have been supplied to the Shebandowan concretions via the diagenetic process; generally a minor fraction of the elements has been abstracted directly from the <b>superjacent</b> <b>water...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Heidelberg and University of Chile in fulfillment of requirements for the academic degree of Master in International Law, Trade, Investments and Arbitration. On 23 rd June, 1947 the Chilean President Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla declared the national sovereignty over the entire continental shelf adjacent to its coast and islands, the soil and subsoil and the <b>superjacent</b> <b>waters</b> to a distance of 200 nautical miles from baselines in order to reserve, protect, preserve and utilize natural resources, giving {{the starting point of}} the exclusive economic zone doctrine. Peru and Ecuador, later on, also made statements along the same lines, and, based on these national backgrounds, the three countries signed the Declaration of Santiago on Maritime Zone, on 18 th August 1952, by which they proclaimed their sovereignty and exclusive jurisdiction over the sea that bathes the coasts to a minimum distance of 200 nautical miles from the related costs, including soil and subsoil that relate to it in order to prevent irrational exploitation of the natural resources located in it and so important for the development of their peoples. Together with this Declaration, several Agreements were signed and a Regional body was created -The Permanent Commission for the South East Pacific- starting a process of regional cooperation and integration, to which Colombia acceded on 1978, that developed the concept of this new maritime space and spread it around the world. The figure created by these countries was finally recognized in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea adopted on 1982, whose figure of the exclusive economic zone was inspired in the principles and institutions created by the South East Pacific Countries. However, during the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru did not share the same view as to the legal nature of the 200 miles zone [...] Peru and Ecuador supported a territorial doctrine, which would give an exclusive sovereign position to coastal States over an area of 200 maritime miles, while Chile and Colombia maintained the idea that in this zone, State competences were sovereign but not for all purposes. Even when these different positions never affected the cooperation and friendly relations among these countries, the different approaches with respect to the legal nature of the zone were transferred to the domestic legislation of the States and, until today, {{can be found in the}} national legislation of these countries. To us, being the South East Pacific countries the proponents of the 200 miles doctrine, it seems important that they try to maintain harmony in the concept of this maritime zone. Until today, Chile is the only country who had ratified the Conventio...|$|E
