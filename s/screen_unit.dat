Using probabilistic approach, the differential equations are developed. These equations are then solved using normalizing conditions to determine the steady state availability of the <b>screening</b> <b>unit.</b> The performance behavior of each subsystem of the <b>screening</b> <b>unit</b> has also been analyzed using Genetic Algorithm. So, the findings of the present paper will be highly useful to the plant management for the timely execution of proper maintenance decisions and hence to enhance the system performance...|$|R

5000|$|The {{patented}} [...] system operates {{through the}} detection of urine temperature, with sensors integral to the <b>screen</b> <b>unit</b> which is positioned above the bowl, {{in front of the}} user. The unit contains a 12-inch LED display, and an Intel Atom Dual-Core processor with a Windows operating system. The hardware is enclosed in a waterproof and vandal-proof, IP65 rated case. The screen is ‘retrofittable’, requiring only power input and internet connection. Projected light points or stickers placed in the bowl indicate to users where to direct their stream in order to play. While the idea predominantly appeals to male competitive instincts, the system can also be installed in female washrooms. These in general are positioned beside the mirrors and hand-dryers, aiming to alleviate boredom experienced whilst queuing by displaying video and visual content.|$|E

40|$|The UK breast {{screening}} programme (UK BSP) is {{organised into}} {{a large number of}} individual <b>screening</b> <b>units.</b> Decision makers need to ensure these units are producing efficiently, particularly as the programme is anticipated to expand. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) was applied to investigate: the relative efficiency of screening units; the impact of <b>screening</b> <b>unit</b> size on efficiency; and how individual units could improve. Sixty-four <b>screening</b> <b>units</b> were categorised into 33 large and 31 small. Data were collected using a national survey and routinely collected data. The overall median efficiency score was 91 %, 39 units were inefficient. Variation in efficiency scores was wide. Large units had a median efficiency score of 100 % and 12 units were inefficient. Smaller units had a median efficiency score of 95 % and 19 were inefficient. This difference was not statistically significant (Mann–Whitney, P= 0. 076). Forty-two percent of large units and 21 % of small units were operating at constant returns to scale (mean difference 0. 20, 95 % CI: 0. 15 – 0. 43). Although there is no systematic difference in efficiency by size of <b>screening</b> <b>unit</b> there are inefficiencies in both large and small units and there is scope for many individual units to improve their use of current resources.

40|$|Rationale and Objectives Women who {{are invited}} {{for breast cancer}} {{screening}} should get enough information about the {{benefits and harms of}} screening to make an informed decision on participation. Personal invitations are an important source of information, because all invited women receive them. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the information breast cancer <b>screening</b> <b>units</b> send to women invited for screening in Finland. Materials and Methods A questionnaire was sent to all breast cancer <b>screening</b> <b>units</b> in Finland in 2005 and 2008, and the information (eg, invitations, results letters, leaflets) the units sent to women was collected. Results from 2005 were sent as feedback to the units. Data were analyzed descriptively, and results from the 2 years were compared. Results <b>Screening</b> <b>units</b> sent personal invitation letters usually providing fixed appointment times. Most units informed about participation free of charge and the benefits of detecting breast cancer early. Harm associated with screening was seldom mentioned; no unit mentioned the possibility of false-negative results or overtreatment.

50|$|During his twenties, LeBoit (who {{had changed}} his name, along with his sister, Shirley, a {{commercial}} artist) developed skills as a draftsman, printer's devil and lithographer. In the mid-1930s, Joseph Lebowitz changed his last name to LeBoit; whether this was to avoid anti-semitism, or to capitalize on interest in French artists is not known. He was drawn to graphic arts, which he believed to be more democratic than painting, as works could be widely disseminated and inexpensive. In 1935 he joined the Graphic Arts Project of the Works Progress Administration. Under these auspices he produced about 25 lithographs, etchings and woodcuts, some {{in the style of}} social realism, others presenting urban life in New York City. He had an administrative role in the Silk <b>Screen</b> <b>Unit</b> under the direction of Anthony Velonis, from 1938 on. Three silk screen prints by LeBoit appear in an article on the early history of that medium. During this time he married Lilian Moore, a teacher and children's author, whose works include the Little Raccoon series; the latter was among the most widely published in children's literature in the former Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|Between 1935 and 1942, Mandelman was {{employed}} the Works Progress Administration's Federal Arts Project (WPA), {{first as a}} muralist and later as a printmaker. In 1937-38 she was sent by the WPA to Butte, Montana, {{to work in the}} Project Art Center teaching art to children and adults. Upon returning to New York, she resumed her studies at the Art Students League to learn printmaking, and joined the WPA Graphic Arts Division. She became one of the original members of the Silk <b>Screen</b> <b>Unit,</b> who, under the leadership of Anthony Velonis, transformed what had been primarily a commercial medium into an artistic one. Her work in this new medium received an immediate and enthusiastic response. By 1941, her work was associated with the early phase of the New York School, and by the early 1940s her prints began to be acquired by museums and were included in exhibitions at major venues such as the Chicago Art Institute, Museum of Modern Art (New York) and the National Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C.). Mandelman worked for the WPA until 1942, when it was disbanded. Although her style would gradually evolve from Social Realism to abstraction, her works from this period reflect a leftist political bent that continued throughout her life, and would resurface later in a series of collages against the Vietnam War that she created in the 1960s and 70s.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To elicit women's {{preferences}} for {{delivery of the}} National Health Service (NHS) Breast Screening Programme. DESIGN: Interview survey. SETTING: Private households in the UK. POPULATION: Five hundred and ninety-seven women aged 45 - 75 interviewed {{as part of the}} National Statistics Omnibus Survey, December 2008 and January 2009. OUTCOMES: Preferred setting (hospital or community) and preferred type of <b>screening</b> <b>unit</b> (mobile or permanent). Rated importance of distance, time, convenience and cost of travelling to a <b>screening</b> <b>unit.</b> RESULTS: Forty per cent of women did not mind whether the <b>screening</b> <b>unit</b> was based in a community or hospital setting, and 52 % did not mind whether the unit was permanent or mobile. Among those who expressed a preference, 59 % preferred a hospital to a community setting, and 62 % preferred a permanent to a mobile unit. Many women (63 %) said distance to a breast <b>screening</b> <b>unit</b> was an important factor, as was time to travel (58 %). Among those with access to a car, 80 % regarded the availability of parking as important, but only 40 % regarded the cost of car travel as important. Among women with no access to a car, there was a similar pattern for ease of public transport (76 %) and cost of public transport (48 %). CONCLUSIONS: Many women were unconcerned about the type and setting of breast <b>screening</b> <b>units.</b> Among those who were concerned, most preferred hospital over community settings and permanent over mobile units, but nonetheless most women said time and distance were important.

40|$|Usim Pac mineral {{processing}} plant simulation software {{is used by}} the University of Minnesota's Coleraine Minerals Research Laboratory Concentrator Modeling Center to simulate taconite plant operations. Its ability to simulate fine screening is limited, since the present suitable models assume a constant partition curve for a given set of screens and do not account for changes in operating conditions. As {{it is well known that}} the fine <b>screen</b> <b>unit</b> operation is sensitive to operating conditions such as feed density, loading, and size, it becomes clear that for accurate simulations, the model will require modifications. Consequently, a series of tests was performed on a pilot scale unit where several of the operating conditions were varied.

40|$|Introduction: If a {{focus of}} {{suspicion}} is classified as being B 3 - 5 by a punch biopsy {{as part of a}} mammography screening, a treatment recommendation will be given in the preoperative conference of the <b>screening</b> <b>unit.</b> In the presented work these recommendations were compared with the final therapeutic approach taken at a certified breast center. Furthermore, it was investigated whether and which additional examinations were performed on patients, depending on compliance with the recommended treatment. Method: The data from 272 patients, who were admitted by the <b>screening</b> <b>unit</b> to the interdisciplinary breast center of the Charité Berlin for further operative investigation from May 2007 to December 2009, was analyzed retrospective. The patients took part in the screening programs of four <b>screening</b> <b>units</b> in Berlin. Additionally data of two patients from one respective <b>screening</b> <b>unit</b> in two other federal states was analyzed. Results: The punch biopsy done in the <b>screening</b> <b>unit,</b> revealed a B 3 -lesion in 48 patients. In all these cases an open biopsy was recommended. Post-operative histological malignancy appeared in 4 of these 48 patients, which ultimately resulted in breast-preserving surgery. In 5 other cases, the punch biopsy was not feasible and an open biopsy was carried out initially. In 2 of these 5 cases the biopsy findings reported as benign, whereas in the other 3 cases, an invasive cancer with the need for breast-preserving surgery was found. In 219 cases the lesion was histologically classified as B 4 or B 5 by the <b>screening</b> <b>unit.</b> In 11. 0 % of these cases (24 / 219) a deviation was found between the ultimately carried out procedure and the preoperative recommendation. In 82. 2 % (180 / 219) there was conformity between planned and performed procedures. Recommendation for additional examination was given in 6. 9 % (15 / 219) cases. A total of 126 additional examinations were performed in 88 of the 219 patients. Clear treatment recommendations were given in 204 of these cases by the <b>screening</b> <b>unit.</b> In 76 of the 204 cases additional examination was performed. In these patients deviation between treatment and recommendation was higher 21. 1 % (16 / 76) than in patients without additional examination 6. 3 % (8 / 128). Conclusion: In order to guarantee optimum treatment the examiner has to be aware of general screening limitations. Therefore interdisciplinary care and close cooperation with radiologists is essential and additional examinations must be conducted if needed, as findings could possibly lead to a change in treatment...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesIssues such as {{specimen}} adequacy and diagnostic yield {{have rarely}} {{been studied in}} rural regions. This study investigated specimen adequacy and the diagnostic yield of cervical smears from outreach screening services in remote regions in eastern Taiwan. Materials and methodsThere were 5670 smears from outreach screening services; 649 smears were taken in mobile <b>screening</b> van <b>units</b> or in temporary walk-in clinics. The quality, compromising factors, and positive rates of smears from mobile <b>screening</b> van <b>units</b> and temporary walk-in clinics were compared with those obtained in physician offices. ResultsThe quality of smears from physician offices {{was better than the}} quality from mobile van <b>screening</b> <b>units</b> and temporary walk-in clinics; the satisfactory rates were 72 %, 54 %, and 53 %, respectively (χ 2  =  109. 9910, p <  0. 0001; df =  4). The most important limiting factor, absence of endocervical component (ECC), was reported in 56 %, 57 %, and 73 % of suboptimal smears at physician offices, mobile van <b>screening</b> <b>units,</b> and temporary walk-in clinics, respectively (χ 2  =  25. 2780, p <  0. 001; df =  2). Poor fixation compromised 18 %, 18 %, and 14 % of smears taken at physician offices, mobile van <b>screening</b> <b>units,</b> and temporary walk-in clinics, respectively. For smears taken in physician offices, the odds ratio for positivity of suboptimal smears with ECC was nine times the odds ratio of suboptimal smears with no ECC. ConclusionThe issue of quality of specimens from outreach services in rural areas needs to be emphasized to improve the sensitivity of the test. In future studies, the difficulties that health workers encounter when taking smears in outreach services and the underlying sociocultural and demographic barriers need to be elucidated...|$|R

40|$|Web {{appendix}} Appendix 1 : Detailed {{justification for}} state transition parameters {{in the model}} Time from onset of symptoms to treatment with and without Find and Treat To {{assess the impact of}} the mobile <b>screening</b> <b>unit,</b> both mobile unit-screened cases and passively presenting controls from the retrospective cohort were divided into three groups: (i) asymptomatic on presentation, (ii) diagnostic delay of up to 131 days, and (iii) diagnostic delay of greater than 131 days. The cut-off of 131 days was used to separate cases that were exceedingly unlikely to present passively from those with shorter delays. The value of 131 days was based on the upper limit of the interquartile range of delays to start of treatment (median 67 days, lower limit 30 days) in a study of the effect of socio-economic deprivation on tuberculosis treatment delays in England in 2000 - 2005 1. Exponential curves (representing models with a constant probability of diagnosis per patient per unit time) were fitted to the proportion of patients still untreated by time since onset of symptoms. Data were aggregated into categories of 10 days length for this purpose. A good fit was found to data from all passively presenting controls, as well as to mobile <b>screening</b> <b>unit</b> cases with delays of up to 131 days (Figure A 1 - 1). A separate exponential curve with a shallower slope fitted the diagnostic delay for mobile <b>screening</b> <b>unit</b> cases with delays of greater than 131 days.
