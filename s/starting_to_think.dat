Cook managed to post his half century and soon England were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about a victory. However, Warne got Bell caught by Langer for a well composed 87. That left England on 170/2 with Paul Collingwood coming in, looking {{to continue the}} good work. There was a period where Collingwood seemed so intent on staying in, he forgot to score. England went into tea at 170/2, having scored 81 runs for 1 wicket in the session.|$|E

500|$|While the video's metamessage {{was clearly}} threatening, it {{remained}} too vague {{to draw any}} definitive conclusions about what the makers' intent might have been. Since it was publicized {{a few weeks before}} Halloween, there was speculation that it could be an Internet prank related to the holiday. After initially being disturbed when the threatening messages were decoded, Krahbichler said, [...] "I'm <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> again it's just an elaborate joke". However, he did not think it was one aimed at him specifically, since if the sender [...] "knew me personally, they would know I don't have the expertise to crack it, at least not the whole thing".|$|E

Like her father, inheriting the Akimichi's clan fighting style, she never turns down an invitation when it comes to food and is quite confident and self-assured about herself, a trait she perhaps inherited from her mother. But during the events of Naruto Gaiden: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, Chocho becomes conscious of her weight while <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that she might be an adopted child. Chocho accompanies her friend Sarada in search of her father, Sasuke, believing the trip to be in search of her [...] "real" [...] father instead. When she witnesses her father's slender figure, she becomes eager to learn the technique.

500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} season, the writers had the idea one of the {{background}} survivors would emerge and receive an on-island flashback episode to help answer the question, [...] "What the hell is going on with the other 35 people who nothing ever happens to?" [...] The first of those was Leslie Arzt, only for him to explode a few episodes later. It was originally conceived only a woman, who was previously an actress, would be introduced into the main storyline, but the idea later changed to include her boyfriend as well. Nikki and Paulo were also originally set [...] "to have anchored a winking arc of stories". However the writers instead decided to tell their story in one episode and quickly remove the characters, due to complaints about the characters and the third season's decline in viewership. It also became a running gag that Sawyer did not know who Nikki and Paulo were, calling them [...] "Nina" [...] and [...] "Pablo" [...] and asking [...] "who the hell [...] ". Lindelof later stated, [...] "We had the feeling with Nikki and Paulo that it wasn't right about a month before the fans started reacting. We were already <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> 'Maybe our instinct here has been wrong.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the lyrics}} were {{composed}} by Batmanglij and Koenig in Batmanglij's apartment (a former factory building in Brooklyn) and at a rented cottage on Martha's Vineyard. The lyrics explore more mature, world-weary themes such as growing old and disillusionment with American foreign policy. The album eschewed the theme of privileged youth from their first two albums in favor of characters with adult responsibilities and reflections on the passage of time. Faith and mortality are recurring themes on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", [...] "Worship You", and [...] "Everlasting Arms". Koenig likened their first three albums to Brideshead Revisited: [...] "The naïve joyous school days in the beginning. Then {{the expansion of the}} world, travel, seeing other places, learning {{a little bit more about}} how people live. And then the end is a little bit of growing up, <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> more seriously about your life and your faith. If people could look at our three albums as a bildungsroman, I’d be O.K. with that." [...] According to Brice Ezell from PopMatters, Modern Vampires of the City is [...] "very much an indie rock record" [...] because of Koenig's voice and diction, which reveals [...] "the youth that he and his bandmates so often strive to shrug off." [...] Ezell asserts that, on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", the [...] "reckless abandon" [...] expressed by the lyrics reveals [...] "the group's grasp on the genuine rebellion that indie rock ought to strive for." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Cherokee Rose" [...] {{attained}} favorable {{reviews from}} television critics. Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, {{and felt that}} it gave an accurate depiction of the characters. He opined: [...] "I {{had a problem with}} the show's tendency to wander into cul-de-sacs in the first season, mainly because so much of it felt redundant, the work of writers who had no real idea how to construct narrative television. But this season, I'm <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> they're getting a handle on things, and [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] is the sort of episode I'd like to see more off [...] as The Walking Dead continues." [...] Paste Josh Jackson asserted that the episode was superior to preceding installments, describing it as [...] "simply a catch of breath." [...] Similarly, Josh Wigler of MTV evaluated that despite less violence than usual, the quality of [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] improved from the previous episode. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall echoed analogous sentiments, and argued that while the show's character still need more development, the development displayed in the episode was a [...] "definite {{step in the right direction}} on that front." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings concluded that the episode contained many powerful scenes. Eric Goldman of IGN was critical of the episode, ultimately giving it a seven out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "good" [...] rating. Goldman felt that [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] was a disappointment, citing that it lack any focus or direction. Henry Hanks, writing for CNN, said that the episode was the weakest of the season.|$|E

In the past using the negative sentiment towards the colonial era was often used as an excuse to disregard protests against the demolition of historical buildings.

2500|$|King was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{about being}} an artist, though this was really a second choice. But art was {{something}} she could do with minimal resources, so {{long as she could}} support herself. King was influenced both by mediaeval sculpture and by Expressionist sculpture, an important part of German avant-garde art, and particularly by the work of the wood-carver, Ernst Barlach (1870–1938). The Nazis considered such art to be decadent (Entartete Kunst) and later attempted to suppress it. King went to see the artist Käthe Kollwitz (1867–1945), whose work she admired. Kollwitz’ advice to King about a career in art was “Don’t do it if you can help it. It is so difficult”. Nevertheless, King did go on. She said: “I haven’t regretted it. I agree with her, it’s difficult.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Laplace's early {{published}} work in 1771 started with differential equations and finite differences {{but he was}} already <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about the mathematical and philosophical concepts of probability and statistics. However, before his election to the Académie in 1773, he had already drafted two papers that would establish his reputation. The first, Mémoire sur la probabilité des causes par les événements was ultimately published in 1774 while the second paper, published in 1776, further elaborated his statistical thinking and also began his systematic work on celestial mechanics and the stability of the Solar System. The two disciplines would always be interlinked in his mind. [...] "Laplace took probability as an instrument for repairing defects in knowledge." [...] Laplace's work on probability and statistics is discussed below with his mature work on the analytic theory of probabilities.|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, Mailer was outspoken {{about his}} mistrust of {{politics}} in general {{as a way of}} meaningful change in America. [...] In Miami and the Siege of Chicago (1968) he explained his view of [...] "politics-as-property" [...] where he likened politicians to property holders who are [...] "never ambivalent about his land, he does not mock it or see other adjacent estates as more deserving than his own". [...] Thus politics is just people trading their influence as capital in an attempt to serve their own interests. [...] This cynical view of politicians serving only themselves perhaps explains his views on Watergate. [...] Mailer saw politics as a sporting event: [...] "If you played for a team, you did your best to play very well, but there was something obscene… with in <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> there was more moral worth to Michigan than Ohio State." [...] Mailer thought that Nixon lost and was demonized only because he played for the wrong team. [...] President Johnson on the other hand, Mailer thought, was just as bad as Nixon had been, but he had had good charisma so all was forgiven.|$|E

2500|$|On a September 2007 {{edition of}} The Radio Factor, while having a {{discussion}} about race with fellow Fox News commentator and author Juan Williams about a meal he shared with Al Sharpton, O'Reilly said [...] "You know when Sharpton and I walked in, it was like... big commotion and everything. But everybody was very nice. And I couldn't get {{over the fact that}} there was no difference between Sylvia's Restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City. I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship." [...] He commented that no one in Sylvia's [...] was [...] "screaming 'M'Fer, I want more iced tea.'" [...] He further added, [...] "I think that black Americans are <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> more and more for themselves, getting away from the Sharptons and the Jacksons and people trying to lead them into a race-based culture. They're just trying to figure it out. 'Look, I can make it. If I work hard and get educated, I can make it.'" [...] The statement drew criticism from a number of places. Roland S. Martin of CNN said that the notion that black people are just now starting to value education is [...] "ridiculous" [...] and that the notion that black people let Sharpton or Jackson think for them is [...] "nuts". Media Matters for America covered the story on a number of occasions. O'Reilly responded, saying, [...] "It was an attempt to tell the radio audience that there is no difference—black, white, we're all Americans. The stereotypes they see on television are not true" [...] and also called out Media Matters, claiming that [...] "Media Matters distorted the entire conversation and implied I was racist for condemning racism." [...] Juan Williams said the criticism of O'Reilly was [...] "rank dishonesty" [...] and that the original comments [...] "had nothing to do with racist ranting by anybody except by these idiots at CNN." [...] Williams went on to say it was [...] "frustrating" [...] that the media try to criticize anyone who wanted to have an honest discussion about race.|$|E
