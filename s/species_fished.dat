25|$|There {{are many}} evidences {{that have been}} {{discovered}} {{in the last decade}} about the Hoko River Community. As archeologists are able to excavate the location and sites surround this river, more information can be gathered about the people that lived along this beautiful river banks. As mentioned in the previous passage, the wet sites provided excellent preservation for artifacts. The rock shelter and the wet sites created extension of the preservation times of these artifacts and items found alongside the river. Evidence shows that Halibut and Cod were the main <b>species</b> <b>fished</b> in this region. Hoko River community fished Halibut and Cod, the preservation of these types of fish was needed to make through the off-season months when fish was scarce. Wooden drying racks were found during one of the excavation sites along the river. The racks provided safe drying area where fish were dried in the sun. This made the preservation of the fish to be extended. Hooks, floats, and cordage were also found along the river that suggests fishing was main source of living for Hoko River Community. This also suggests that there was a social ranking was present during this time.|$|E

5000|$|Many sea {{cucumbers}} are valued as food {{and as a}} source of medicine, and Stichopus is a commonly exploited genus. S. monotuberculatus is used for both food and medicine. Stichopus species are important in traditional medicine practices in Malaysia.

One <b>species</b> <b>fished</b> as gamat is S. horrens. This species is also harvested for food in Samoa. The parts considered edible are the viscera, especially the intestine. A fisher will take the cucumber from the water and place it in a bucket for a few hours to let it pass any sand from its gut. The fisher will then cut out its intestine and sometimes its respiratory system and gonads, as well, and release the still-living animal. The viscera are eaten raw and fresh, or bottled and sold in the community. Apparently, most cucumbers survive this treatment, {{at least in the short}} term.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The fish {{communities}} of all Austrian natural lakes (n 43) larger than 50 ha in surface area were assessed {{and the historical}} fish communities in c. 1850 were reconstructed. During the last 150 years, the fish {{communities of}} Austrian lakes have altered: in 49 % of lakes at least one indigenous <b>fish</b> <b>species,</b> usually sensitive or small-bodied taxa, is now missing. Conversely, {{in all but one}} of the 43 lakes the number of <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> has increased. In particular, certain <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> of interest to angling and commercial fisheries now occur in more lakes. Generalised linear models were used to identify variables that would explain the loss of <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> using categories of lake use (ranking score). The category human population density around the lakes seemed to be one of the main causes for the loss of <b>fish</b> <b>species.</b> KEYWORDS: Directive. <b>fish</b> communities, human impact, indigenous <b>fish</b> <b>species,</b> loss of <b>fish</b> <b>species,</b> Water Framewor...|$|R

Nephrops is a widely distributed species but despite its common name, the “Dublin Bay Prawn”, this species is not found in Dublin Bay.

40|$|Abstract: The Pacific jack Caranx caninus is {{a common}} <b>species</b> <b>fished</b> by artisanal {{fishermen}} {{off the coast of}} Colima, México. During 2002, monthly samples of morphometric data and otoliths were taken to determine age and growth. Seven age groups were identified. The highest growth, 14. 4 cm, takes place {{during the first year of}} life. During the second year, C. caninus grows 11. 76 cm; the third year 9. 61 cm; the fourth 7. 85 cm; the fifth 6. 41 cm and sixth year 5. 24 cm. The constants of von Bertalanffy´s growth equation were: L ∞ = 83. 26 cm, W ∞ = 18. 138 g, K = 0. 202, to =- 0. 283 and A 0. 95 = 15 years. Growth curves of other species of the same genus were calculated in order to compare them with the one obtained in the present work.
