6000|$|To this {{accident}} of Saupe's little Book there was, meanwhile, added another not less unexpected: a message, namely, from Bibliopolic Head-quarters {{that my own}} poor old Book on Schiller was to be reprinted, and that in this [...] "People's Edition" [...] it would want (on deduction of the German Piece by Goethe, which {{had gone into the}} [...] "Library Edition," [...] but which had no fitness here) some sixty or seventy pages for the proper size of the volume. Saupe, which I was still reading, or idly reading-about, offered the ready expedient:—and here accordingly Saupe is. I have had him faithfully translated, and with some small omissions or abridgments, slight transposals here and there for clearness' sake, and one or two elucidative patches, gathered from the three <b>subsidiary</b> <b>Books</b> already named, all duly distinguished from Saupe's text;—whereby the gap or deficit of pages is well filled up, almost of its own accord. And thus I can now certify that, in all essential respects, the authentic Saupe is here made accessible to English readers as to German; and hope that to many lovers of Schiller among us, who are likely to be lovers also of humbly beautiful Human Worth, and of such an unconsciously noble scene of Poverty made richer than any California, as that of the elder Schiller Household here manifests, it may be a welcome and even profitable bit of reading.|$|R

Multinational Enterprises and Tort Liabilities employs an interdisciplinary and comparative perspective to shed light on why thus far, no innovative solutions have been identified. The thesis of the book is twofold. First, the legal conception of MNEs is said to misalign with the actual horizontal organizational and ownership structure of MNEs. Second, as a result, the liability theories that have been developed on the basis of this legal concept are inapt to make for a just liability regime for tort victims, because they allow MNEs to effectively evade liability for torts arising out of the actions by their <b>subsidiary</b> companies. The <b>book</b> is structured in three parts: ‘Concept of Multinational Enterprise’,‘Exploring the Tort Liability of Multinational Enterprises’, and ‘A Way Forward’. status: publishe...|$|R
