40|$|The paper {{begins with}} the {{plausible}} view that criminal responsibility should track moral responsibility, and explains its plausibility. A necessary distinction is then drawn between liability and answerability as two dimensions of responsibility, and is shown to underpin the distinction in criminal law between offences and defences. This enables us to distinguish strict liability from strict answerability, and to see that whilst <b>strict</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> seems inconsistent with the principle that criminal responsibility should track moral responsibility, strict criminal answerability is not. We must ask, therefore, whether, when and why strict criminal responsibility is unacceptable...|$|E

40|$|The law {{has long}} {{recognized}} a presumption against <b>criminal</b> <b>strict</b> <b>liability.</b> This Note situates that presumption {{in terms of}} moral intuitions {{about the role of}} intention and the unique nature of criminal punishment. Two sources-recent laws from state legislatures and recent advances in moral philosophy-pose distinct challenges to the presumption against strict liability crimes. This Note offers a solution to the philosophical problem that informs how courts could address the legislative problem. First, it argues that the purported problem from philosophy stems from a mistaken relationship drawn between criminal law and morality. Second, it outlines a slightly more nuanced moral framework that both accommodates recent thinking in philosophy and preserves the correspondence between moral theory and criminal law that underwrites the presumption against <b>criminal</b> <b>strict</b> <b>liability.</b> Finally, it considers how the contours of this moral framework could inform judicial efforts to accommodate and constrain new <b>criminal</b> <b>strict</b> <b>liability</b> laws...|$|R

40|$|H. L. A. Hart {{argues that}} <b>strict</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> often {{undermines}} the moral condemnation associated with punishment and therefore its capacity for deterrence. Hart explains that insofar as legal punishment expresses the 2 ̆ 2 odium, {{if not the}} hostility 2 ̆ 2 of a community towards those who break its laws strict liability forces us to either condemn {{those who are not}} deserving of condemnation or to negate the moral condemnation of the law in general. One choice is immoral and the other reduces the effectiveness of a significant deterrent and is therefore counterproductive. Either way, the consequences of strict liability are undesirable. In this paper, I will defend Hart 2 ̆ 7 s thesis against its objectors. I will also propose and defend an original reason to believe Hart 2 ̆ 7 s thesis.

Suppose an actor commits an intentional assault or rape, and accidentally brings about a death. Punishing the actor more seriously because the death resulted is sometimes justifiable, even absent proof of his independent culpability as to the death. But what punishment is proportionate for such an actor? Should he be punished as harshly as an intentional or knowing killer? This article offers a framework for analysing these difficult questions. After rejecting a broad forfeiture justification for strict liability in grading, it articulates a more promising set of arguments, premised on the actor’s ‘change of normative position’ by choosing to commit a crime. Three principles of culpability sometimes justify strict liability in grading: holistic culpability, attention to the degree of unjustifiability of the risk, and rough comparability in culpability. Strict liability in grading can be appropriate when the risk of committing the more serious crime (i) is a risk intrinsic to the less serious crime or (ii) is minimally foreseeable. The article also addresses the relevance of moral luck, ie the principle that the fortuitous occurrence of a result or circumstance increases the actor’s just deserts. Even if moral luck is recognized, it cannot fully justify strict liability in grading...|$|E

40|$|The {{basis of}} this thesis is an {{investigation}} of Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) administrative and criminal enforcement files, relating to UK detentions and prosecutions. It would appear {{that this is the}} first time that such an analysis has been made. The thesis is divided into four parts of which Part B and C form the heart of the work. These two consider administrative (Part B) and criminal (Part C) enforcement measures and discusses their legal basis. But before these subjects are dealt with in more detail, enforcement personnel and their roles are analysed (Part A), and their role is compared to inspectors of the Health and Safety Executive and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB). Human rights and their impact on both enforcement process and inspectors of MCA and MAIB are addressed within the context of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 and Regulations issued under the Act. The thesis identifies inconsistencies of UK legislation when compared with European law and apparent lack of clarification within UK law. The analysis of administrative enforcement measures focuses on detentions of merchant ships whereas the discussion of criminal enforcement measures concentrates on the areas which the files suggested were the most affected by investigations and prosecutions, namely groundings, violations of the Collision Regulations and pollution incidents. It becomes clear from the research that detentions by far outweigh prosecutions, that MCA policy supports this approach and that enforcement personnel indicate a preference for such administrative enforcement measures. However, a large number of Detention Notices were found non-compliant with legal requirements. Still only one case was identified, documented and discussed where the MCA was taken to arbitration by the owner affected by a detention. The thesis offers suggestions as to how the work of MCA enforcement personnel can be improved and (Part D) what measures would seem to be appropriate for the lawmakers to take in the future. It is suggested that the approach taken in recent European oil pollution legislation to focus on serious negligence rather than on <b>strict</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> could offer a suitable way forward. Throughout this work I have endeavoured to state the law as at 31 October 2008. In a number of cases it has been possible to take account of developments since that date as my viva voce only took place in June 2009. I have made reference to new European and UK pollution legislation (see Chapter 13, fn 1) which came into force or will come into force in the course of 2009. I also used the decision in TS Lines Ltd v. Delphis NV (The TS Singapore), [2009] EWHC B 4 (Comm) in Chapter 8. 6. 2. to help clarify the discussion about the quantum of compensation in an arbitration over a detention. But I did not carry out a detailed analysis of the new legislation and that case. The decision in Club Cruise Entertainment and Travelling Services Europe BV v. The Department For Transport [2008] EWHC 2794 (Comm) of 18 November 2008, however, was fully analysed and relevant aspects found their way into the discussion in the thesis.

40|$|Serious {{forms of}} crime have {{abandoned}} the merely national dimension and become transnational: think of terrorism, organized crime, computer crime, trafficking in human beings, {{just to name a}} few. In order to adequately fight this kind of phenomena, criminal law should do the same and not be so tied to the merely national dimension. European citizens ask for security and their request should be interpreted as expressing the need for regulatory interventions in the criminal field. Of course they deserve certainty as to the fact that appropriate sanctioning measures will be taken by all the Member States of the European Union (EU) in order to effectively deal with crime. Anyway, one should remember that criminal law must not be dissociated from the protection of fundamental rights because that would result in the denial of basic values inherent in democratic societies, first of all the rule of law. Then, the need for an axiological horizon and principles which found and limit the EU criminal system arises. So, my research question is: what are the axiological horizon and the principles which found and limit the EU criminal system? This work focuses on the precedents of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), so on a judge-made law whose development has basically been made possible thanks to the preliminary ruling procedure. No one denies that case law should remain bound to the specific case, inasmuch the extension of the ratio decidendi to other cases always is the result of selective operations. However, the presentation of the topics in this PhD thesis shows not only that the judgments of the ECJ in the criminal field are numerous, but also that they are characterized by the progressive emergence of a criminal law consciousness, a criminal law sensibility, and the will to create a system which is intrinsically consistent. The case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) is also taken into account in light of the phenomenon called cross-fertilization. The works of Italian and European legal scholars are considered too. So, after an Introduction on the relationship between globalization, crime, and competences of the EU in criminal matters, the thesis deals with the concept of criminal law (First Chapter), the principles of legality of criminal offences and penalties (Second Chapter), offensiveness (Third Chapter), guilt (Fourth Chapter), and proportionality (Fifth Chapter) in the case law of the ECJ. In the Conclusion, an assessment of the results is provided. As problematic as it seems, the search for an axiological horizon and principles of EU criminal law has proven fruitful. In the first chapter, I found out {{that it is possible to}} identify two notions of criminal law which have been developed by the ECJ in the last twenty-five years. According to the former, criminal law is that branch of law which aims at protecting the values that are deemed fundamental by national communities. According to the latter, the criminal nature of a sanction should be asserted in light of the so-called Engel criteria as developed by the EctHR (legal classification of the offence under national law, very nature of the offence, and degree of severity of the sanction). The latter approach is now prevailing. At first sight, they do not look so different, but I think the latter should be preferred because of the different axiological horizon. The former approach relies on the values that are deemed fundamental by national communities, while the latter one implicitly relies on the European Convention on Human Rights. So, it is characterized by an inclusive dimension which may lack in the former one, since fundamental national values may not be consistent with human rights (think of the case of Hungary). The second chapter is devoted to the principle of legality of criminal offences and penalties and takes into account five major issues: the interpretative incidence of EU directives in criminal matters (the prohibition of determining or aggravating the liability in criminal law and the duty of conforming interpretation); the interpretative incidence of EU regulations and frameworks decisions (the duty of conforming interpretation); the integrating incidence of EU law (how EU law shapes the meaning of national legislation); the disapplying incidence (in case national provisions are not consistent with EU law, with in bonam partem effects); the lex mitior principle. The analysis led to the conclusion that the principle of legality of criminal offences and penalties is not dead, as someone said, but has adapted to national and international realities which have changed. The third chapter deals with the principle of offensiveness and is divided into two parts. In the first part, an analysis is provided with reference to those judgments (Amsterdam Bulb, Commission v Hellenic Republic) in which the ECJ ruled that some legal interests which belong to the EU (above all, the financial ones) should be protected by the Member States under conditions, both procedural and substantive, which are analogous to those applicable to infringements of national law of a similar nature and importance and which, in any event, make the penalty effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in light of the principle of sincere cooperation. In the second part, recent judgments concerning criminal law and immigration law (El Dridi, Achughbabian, Sagor) are considered in order to show how the ECJ has questioned national lawmakers' choices which were inconsistent with the principle of sincere cooperation. The fourth chapter is dedicated to the principle of guilt and, more specifically, to six topics: The distinction between intentionally-committed and unintentionally-committed offences, the concept of intentional offence, the concept of negligence, <b>strict</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>liability,</b> Ignorantia legis non excusat, and the concept of force majeure. In the fifth chapter, the case law concerning the principle of proportionality is taken into consideration by highlighting how the ECJ has solved the cases in which a clash between national regulations criminal in nature and one of the four fundamental freedoms had occurred. It is quite interesting to notice that the solution given by the Court has always aimed at finding a balance point between the values at stake by identifying some conditions under which the four fundamental freedoms may be sacrificed. In conclusion, the gradual recognition of competences in criminal matters to the European Union is the result of the emergence of the political identity of the Union, since the creation of criminal law – both at the international and national level – requires the prior identification of a system of shared fundamental values, which are expressive of an identity. Some legal scholars, in analyzing the events and reasons for the failure of the draft European Constitution, spoke of the absence of a European people characterized by common ethnicity, culture, society and language. Such reasoning has been discussed among criminal law scholars for a long time with reference to European criminal law, since the unification of criminal law presupposes the cultural unification of Europe. The point is that, without assuming a world legal commonality, one can hypothise a European legal commonality. In my opinion, it is very convincing the reasoning of those who state that the foundation of human rights must be sought not – or not only – in the human nature, but also – and most of all – in the history and culture of peoples, considering, at least at the European level, the set of ideas and principles of the tradition of the old continent, through the reference to the Christian roots of Europe and the Enlightenment. So, those values already exist. Undoubtedly, the culture of the Europeans is the culture of human rights, and the lingua franca of Europe is the language of rights as declined in the Nice Charter and the European Convention of Human Rights. As demonstrated in the thesis, the jurisprudential experience of the Court of Justice has been mature enough to get to deal with the issues of protection of fundamental rights and, most of all, the protection of those rights through criminal law. The Court did so by progressively becoming aware of the nature of that branch of law – as explained in the first chapter – which has been considered not as a simple tool of repression, but as a means through which affirm and reaffirm freedoms. I believe that can reasonably be confirmed by turning the attention to the essence of the principles of legality, offensiveness, guilt, proportionality. As a matter of fact, they represent the limits to the use of criminal methods of repression, the observance of which leads to the outcome of legitimization and re-legitimization of criminal law, both at the national and international level; they indicate the existence of criminal awareness and sensitivity of the Court; they mark the road that will lead to the final result of the emergence of a criminal law of the European Union, made up of both a general part and a special part, both inspired, supported and controlled by those principles...|$|E
