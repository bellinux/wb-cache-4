5|$|One of Snedden's first actions was to readdress the paper's {{stance on}} Alaska <b>statehood.</b> Lathrop and the News-Miner had been {{strongly}} opposed to <b>statehood,</b> but after Snedden took control, he analyzed {{the issue and}} came out strongly in favor of Alaska <b>statehood.</b> The News-Miner continually published editorials in favor of <b>statehood,</b> and encouraged other newspapers across the U.S. to do the same. In 1955 and 1956, when the Alaska Constitutional Convention {{took place at the}} University of Alaska Fairbanks, the News-Miner set up special telephone lines from the convention chambers to the newspaper's office. Daily reports were printed, recording the delegates' progress.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to create}} an all-Indian state named Oklahoma and a later attempt {{to create an}} all-Indian state named Sequoyah failed but the Sequoyah <b>Statehood</b> Convention of 1905 {{eventually}} {{laid the groundwork for}} the Oklahoma <b>Statehood</b> Convention, which took place two years later. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was established as the 46th state in the Union.|$|E
5|$|By 1815 Jennings and the {{territorial}} legislature {{were ready to}} embark on a course for <b>statehood.</b> In December 1815 Jennings's introduced a petition from {{the territorial}} legislature to Congress that requested <b>statehood</b> for Indiana. The 1815 census showed the territory had a population exceeding 63,000, more than the minimum requirement for <b>statehood</b> under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The House began a debate on the measure and passed the Enabling Act on April 11, 1816. The act granted Indiana the right to form a government and elect delegates to a constitutional convention that would create a state constitution. The territorial governor, Thomas Posey, expressed concern that the territory was too under-populated to provide sufficient tax revenue to fund a state government. In a letter to President Madison, he recommended that the president veto the bill and delay <b>statehood</b> for another three years, which would allow him to finish his term as governor. Madison signed the bill, ignoring Posey's plea.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Mobile was {{included}} in the Mississippi Territory in 1813, the population had dwindled to roughly 300 people. The city {{was included in}} the Alabama Territory in 1817, after Mississippi gained <b>statehood.</b> Alabama was granted <b>statehood</b> in 1819; Mobile's population had increased to 809 by that time.|$|E

5|$|Kentucky was {{initially}} Kentucky County in Virginia. It achieved <b>statehood</b> and {{was admitted to}} the Union on June 1, 1792; see the list of governors of Virginia for the period before <b>statehood.</b> There have been 57 governors, serving 61 distinct terms.|$|E
5|$|Greenup {{served as}} clerk {{of the first}} Kentucky <b>statehood</b> {{convention}} in Danville in 1784. He was elected as a delegate to the second and sixth <b>statehood</b> conventions in 1785 and 1788, respectively, and was a trustee {{of the city of}} Danville in 1787. H.E. Everman, biographer of fellow delegate James Garrard, noted that despite Greenup's excellent legal background and legislative experience, his lack of oratorical skills prevented him from taking more of a leadership role in the conventions.|$|E
5|$|In 1812, Jonathan Jennings {{defeated}} Harrison's chosen {{candidate and}} became the territory's representative to Congress. Jennings used his position there to attempt to speed up Indiana's path to <b>statehood</b> by immediately introducing legislation to grant Indiana <b>statehood,</b> even though {{the population of the}} entire territory was under 25,000. Jennings did this against the wishes of incoming governor Thomas Posey, and there was noted disagreement between the two men on the subject. No action was taken on the legislation at the time, though, because of the outbreak of the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|In 1849 James Goodhue began {{publication}} of the Minnesota Pioneer newspaper in Saint Paul (the paper would later be renamed the St. Paul Pioneer Press). By the time the area achieved <b>statehood</b> 89 newspapers had been established. Information about Minnesota published in these periodicals spread throughout the United States and Europe. Advertising campaigns were launched in the northeastern U.S. and Europe to lure European settlers. These efforts met with limited success though they would become much more successful after <b>statehood.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December 1817, Edwards, {{responding}} to a movement for <b>statehood</b> led by his ally Daniel Pope Cook, recommended to the legislature that Illinois apply for admission to the Union. He also recommended that a census first be taken of the territory, a standard practice, but the legislature rejected this. Legislators, particularly those opposed to slavery, feared that any delay would allow Missouri to apply for <b>statehood</b> before Illinois, and that since Missouri was a slave state, this would cause so much turmoil in Congress that it would delay Illinois' admission even longer.|$|E
5|$|In early 1816, the Territory {{approved}} a census and Pennington {{was named to}} be the census enumerator. The population of the territory {{was found to be}} 63,897, above the cutoff required for <b>statehood.</b> A constitutional convention met on June 10, 1816, in Corydon. Because of the heat of the season, the delegation moved outdoors on many days and wrote the constitution beneath the shade of a giant elm tree. The state's first constitution was completed on June 29, and elections were held in August to fill the offices of the new state government. In November Congress approved <b>statehood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lithuania had a centuries long {{tradition}} of <b>statehood</b> following the coronation of Mindaugas the King of Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|Moran {{does not}} support {{granting}} <b>statehood</b> to the District of Columbia. However, he voted to allow Washington, D.C., to send a voting representative to the United States Congress.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma, {{admitted}} to <b>statehood</b> in 1907, chose a Senator by legislative election three times: twice in 1907, when admitted, {{and once in}} 1908. In 1912, Oklahoma reelected Robert Owen by advisory popular vote.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee County, Tennessee (17881796): When Tennessee {{achieved}} <b>statehood,</b> {{the previous}} Tennessee County in North Carolina became Tennessee County, Tennessee, and {{was divided into}} Montgomery and Robertson Counties.|$|E
5|$|The California Diamond Jubilee half dollar was a United States {{commemorative}} silver fifty-cent piece {{struck at}} the San Francisco Mint in 1925. It was issued {{to celebrate the}} 75th anniversary of California <b>statehood.</b>|$|E
5|$|The News-Miner {{strongly}} supported the political campaign for <b>statehood</b> until 1959, when Alaska became the 49th {{state of the}} United States. On the day the U.S. Congress voted to have Alaska admitted as a state, Snedden arranged for a U.S. Air Force jet to fly copies of the News Miner, the Anchorage Times, and other Alaska newspapers to Washington, D.C. On {{the morning after the}} vote, each Congressman had an Alaska newspaper proclaiming <b>statehood.</b>|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Post Office issued two {{postage stamps}} in {{commemoration}} of the Battle of Alamo and Texas <b>Statehood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the first}} half of the 19th century, the northeastern portion of the state was a part of the Northwest Territory, formed in 1787. After Ohio's <b>statehood</b> the area became part of the new Illinois Territory in 1809. After Illinois' <b>statehood</b> the area was {{incorporated}} into the Michigan Territory in 1818 and later became part of the Wisconsin Territory in 1836. The western and southern areas of the state were not formally organized until 1838, when they became part of the Iowa Territory.|$|E
5|$|A poll {{carried out}} {{immediately}} after the shooting (in October 30–31) by the Center for Sociological Studies of the National Academy of Sciences of Armenia found that 56.9% of respondents said that the October 27 events were a crime against <b>statehood</b> and the country's authorities. 63.4% of those questioned believed that the terrorist group consisted of assassins–traitors and enemies.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{appeared}} before the Continental Congress as early as September 1778 on behalf of Vermont, seeking recognition as an independent state. He reported that due to Vermont's expansion to include border towns from New Hampshire, Congress was reluctant to grant independent <b>statehood</b> to Vermont. Between 1780 and 1783 Allen participated, along with his brother Ira, Vermont Governor Thomas Chittenden, and others, in negotiations with Frederick Haldimand, the governor of Quebec, that were ostensibly about prisoner exchanges, but were really about establishing Vermont as a new British province and gaining military protection for its residents. The negotiations, once details of them were published, were often described by opponents of Vermont <b>statehood</b> as treasonous, but no such formal charges were ever laid against anyone involved.|$|E
5|$|Before 1856 {{there was}} minimal {{discussion}} of <b>statehood</b> within Minnesota. However, as {{discussion of a}} potential transcontinental railroad in the U.S. became serious, leaders in Minnesota recognized that a territory was in a weak position to lobby for this economic opportunity.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1836, Congress {{proposed}} a compromise whereby Michigan gave up its claim to the strip in exchange for its <b>statehood</b> and approximately three-quarters of the Upper Peninsula. The compromise was considered a poor outcome for Michigan. Voters in a state convention in September soundly rejected the proposal.|$|E
5|$|Five {{counties}} in Florida have been renamed. Most renamings occurred between 1845 and 1861, {{during the first}} sixteen years of Florida's <b>statehood.</b> One occurred in 1997, when Dade County {{changed its name to}} Miami-Dade County.|$|E
5|$|Governor Harrison had wide-ranging {{powers in}} the new territory, {{including}} authority to appoint territorial officials and the legislature, as well as authority to divide the territory into smaller political districts and counties. One of his primary responsibilities was to obtain title to Indian lands that would allow future settlement and increase the territory's population, a requirement for <b>statehood.</b> Harrison was eager to expand the territory for personal reasons as well; his political fortunes were tied to Indiana's eventual <b>statehood.</b> On February 8, 1803, when President Jefferson reappointed Harrison as the Indiana territorial governor, he also granted Harrison the authority to negotiate and conclude treaties with the Indians.|$|E
5|$|In 1812, Jonathan Jennings {{defeated}} Harrison's chosen {{candidate and}} became the territory's representative to Congress. Jennings immediately introduced legislation to grant Indiana <b>statehood,</b> even though {{the population of the}} entire territory was under 25,000, but no action was taken on the legislation because of the outbreak of the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|In 1856 the Minnesota Territory {{established}} {{its first}} Commissioner of Emigration, Eugene Burnand. Through advertisements and speeches to new {{immigrants to the}} U.S. in New York, Burnand expanded the immigration trend which later created a large German community after <b>statehood.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1901, a {{group of}} <b>statehood</b> {{supporters}} broke into the El Diario's building, vandalizing most of the equipment. Following this incident, {{the family moved to}} Caguas where he reopened La Democracia. After receiving further threats from the <b>statehood</b> movements, Muñoz Rivera decided to move to New York City, not before leaving the paper's editing in charge of one of his followers. There he founded the bilingual newspaper Puerto Rico Herald, in which he heavily criticized the United States' stance on Puerto Rico. During the following years, the family constantly traveled between both locations. Muñoz Rivera, together with Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, Antonio R. Barceló and José de Diego, founded the Union of Puerto Rico party, which won the election in 1904. Following the party's victory, he was selected as a member the House of Delegates.|$|E
5|$|In Seattle {{the next}} day, Harding kept up his busy schedule, {{giving a speech}} to 25,000 people at the stadium at the University of Washington. In the final speech he gave, Harding {{predicted}} <b>statehood</b> for Alaska. The president rushed through his speech, not waiting for applause by the audience.|$|E
5|$|In Taylor's view, {{the best}} way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery {{question}} out of Congress's hands. The timing for <b>statehood</b> was in Taylor's favor, as the Gold Rush was well underway {{at the time of}} his inauguration, and California's population was exploding. The administration dispatched Rep. Thomas Butler King to California, to test the waters and advocate on behalf of <b>statehood,</b> knowing that the Californians were certain to adopt an anti-slavery constitution. King found that a constitutional convention was already underway, and by October 1849, the convention unanimously agreed to join the Union—and to ban slavery within their borders.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma Territory was {{reported}} in 1892 to be around 85 percent white, 10 percent colored and 5 percent Indian. Oklahoma was awarded <b>statehood</b> in 1907, with a constitution that enshrined racial segregation (Jim Crow laws). In 1911 the local school had 555 white students and one black.|$|E
5|$|Over {{most of its}} route, the East Plains Trail {{went through}} a post-glacial {{landscape}} of lakes, moraines, and drumlins, with beautiful scenery and difficult swamps. As the area became settled during Minnesota’s territorial and early <b>statehood</b> days, the routes were improved, stagecoach service was instituted, towns were established, and permanent settlement began.|$|E
5|$|Posey {{had created}} a rift in the {{politics}} of the territory by supporting slavery, much to the chagrin of opponents like Jennings, Dennis Pennington, and others who dominated the Territorial Legislature and who sought to use the bid for <b>statehood</b> to permanently end slavery in the territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{anniversary of}} the First Serbian Uprising's commencement, 15 February, is celebrated {{annually}} in Serbia through a public holiday known as <b>Statehood</b> Day, first introduced in July 2001. A statue of Karađorđe {{stands in front of}} Belgrade's Church of Saint Sava, within the eponymous Karađorđe's Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{flag was}} {{designed}} in 1901 by John Eisenmann for the Pan-American Exposition and adopted in 1902. Before that, {{for nearly a}} century after <b>statehood,</b> Ohio did not have a legally-authorized state flag. One unsuccessful proposal called for a design based on the state seal.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} {{aspirations of}} the Partisan movement were reflected in the State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia, which developed in 1943 as the bearer of Croatian <b>statehood</b> and later transformed into the Parliament of Croatia in 1945, and AVNOJ—its counterpart at the Yugoslav level.|$|E
