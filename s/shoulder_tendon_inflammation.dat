40|$|Tendonitis and {{tendinitis}} are terms used {{to describe}} an inflamed and painful tendon. Tendinopathy, is a descriptive term for describing clinical conditions arising from tendon injury and overuse both within and around tendons. The aim of this mini-review is to explore the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) in tendon disorders. A number of investigators including our group have proposed that pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 1 β are initiators of tendinopathies, stimulating inflammation, apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. This {{is one of the}} reasons why IL- 1 β is frequently used in culture models of <b>tendon</b> <b>inflammation</b> to study the inflammatory and catabolic responses of tenocytes. However, some researchers oppose this view and suggest that although IL- 1 β may play a role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA), the involvement of IL- 1 β in the development of tendinopathy is questionable. This mini-review discusses the relevant papers published in this area and summarises the evidence for and against the involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 1 β in tendonitis.

40|$|<b>Shoulder</b> <b>tendon</b> {{injuries}} including impingement, {{rotator cuff}} disease, and biceps tendon pathology are common clinical conditions {{and are a}} significant source of joint pain, instability, and dysfunction. These injuries may progress into partial tears then to complete tendon ruptures, which have limited healing capacity even when surgically repaired. These injuries are frequently seen in the presence of abnormal scapulothoracic joint kinematics (termed scapular dyskinesis). However, the cause and effect relationship between scapular dyskinesis and shoulder injury has not been directly defined. Additionally, while the incidence of shoulder injuries and recurrent failure of repairs is well-documented, the mechanisms behind them are not well-established, making optimal clinical management difficult. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to examine the effect of scapular dyskinesis on the initiation and progression of pathological changes in the rotator cuff and biceps tendon and to define the mechanical processes that lead to these changes. Unfortunately, clinical and cadaveric studies are unable to address the underlying causes of injury and cannot evaluate the injury process over time. Therefore, a rat model of scapular dyskinesis (created by denervating the trapezius and serratus anterior) was developed and used, both alone and in combination with overuse, to investigate the cause and effect relationships between changes in joint loading and alterations in tendon mechanical, histological, organizational, and biological properties. We hypothesized that scapular dyskinesis would result in altered joint loading conditions that would lead to degeneration of the rotator cuff and long head of the biceps. We found that scapular dyskinesis diminished joint function and passive joint mechanics and significantly reduced tendon properties. We also investigated the effect of overuse on tendon properties and found that overuse activity in the presence of scapular dyskinesis resulted in significantly more structural and biological adaptations than scapular dyskinesis alone. We also investigated the effect of scapular dyskinesis on supraspinatus tendon healing and found that scapular dyskinesis was detrimental to tendon properties. These results indicate that scapular dyskinesis is a causative mechanical mechanism of <b>shoulder</b> <b>tendon</b> injury. Identification of scapular dyskinesis as a mechanism of pathological changes will help inform and guide clinicians in developing optimal prevention and long-term rehabilitation strategies. ...|$|R

Histological analysis of the L group showed a decrease in the number of inflammatory cells in relation to other groups in both periods studied. the comparative results between the number of inflammatory cells in the control and treated groups at 7 and 14 days showed statistically significant differences. Qualitative analysis findings obtained by the picrosirius red technique under polarized light showed that in 7 days, the T group presented collagen types I and III in the same proportion; group D presented a predominance of type III fibers, while in group L, type I collagen predominated. the 14 -day group D showed collagen types I and III in the same proportion, while in group L, there was a predominance of type I fibers. Biomechanical analysis showed that 7 -day groups L and C showed similar stiffness and increased breaking strength. the 14 -day groups L and C showed greater rupturing strength as well as increased stiffness angle. Group D showed a decrease of maximum traction strength and degree of rigidity. It was concluded that treatment with LIL in the parameters used and the times studied reduces migration of inflammatory cells and improves the quality of repair while reducing the functional limitations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} the validity of grayscale-based quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measures of the biceps and supraspinatus tendons. DESIGN: Nine QUS measures of the biceps and supraspinatus tendons were computed from ultrasound images collected from 67 manual wheelchair users. Shoulder pathology was measured using questionnaires, physical examination maneuvers, and a clinical ultrasound grading scale. RESULTS: Increased age, duration of wheelchair use, and body mass correlated with a darker and more homogenous tendon appearance. Subjects with pain during physical examination tests for biceps tenderness and acromioclavicular joint tenderness exhibited significantly different supraspinatus QUS values. Even when controlling for tendon depth, QUS measures of the biceps tendon differed significantly between subjects with healthy tendons, mild tendinosis, and severe tendinosis. Clinical grading of supraspinatus tendon health was correlated with QUS measures of the supraspinatus tendon. CONCLUSIONS: QUS is valid method to quantify tendinopathy and may allow for early detection of tendinosis. Manual wheelchair users are at a high risk for developing <b>shoulder</b> <b>tendon</b> pathology and may benefit from QUS-based research that focuses on identifying interventions designed to reduce this risk.

In this study, we performed microRNA (miRNA) expression analysis in the long head of the human <b>shoulder</b> biceps <b>tendon</b> to identify key genes whose expression was altered during inflammation in patients with glenohumeral arthritis. We identified differential regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that could be critical in collagen type replacement during tendinopathy.

Interestingly, all of these seven miRNAs were previously reported to have either a direct or indirect role in regulating the ECM organization in other pathological disorders. In addition, these miRNAs were also found to alter the expression levels of MMPs, which are the key matrix degrading enzymes associated with ECM-related abnormalities and pathologies.

However tendons are relatively avascular and {{not considered to}} have high oxygen requirements and the vulnerability of tendon cells to hypoxia is unclear. Cultured human tenocytes were exposed to hypoxia and the cellular response detected using QPCR, Western blotting, viability, and ELISA assays. We find that tenocytes respond to hypoxia in vitro by activating classical HIF- 1 α-driven pathways. Total hypoxia caused significant tenocyte apoptosis. Transcription factors typically involved in hypoxic response, HIF- 1 α and FOXO 3 A, were upregulated. Hypoxia caused sustained upregulation of several proapoptotic proteins known to mediate hypoxia-induced apoptosis, such as Bnip 3 and Nix, but others were unchanged although they were reportedly hypoxia-sensitive in other cell types. Antiapoptotic proteins Bcl 2 and Bcl-xL were unchanged by hypoxia. Normal human tenocytes expressed all isoforms of the hypoxia-induced vascular growth factor VEGF except VEGF-D. Hypoxia markedly upregulated VEGF-A mRNA, followed by increased VEGF protein secretion. However treatment with VEGF did not improve tenocyte survival.

Therefore, we hypothesized that HGF in PRP causes the anti-inflammatory effects.

Although the disease is frequent, about 10 to 42 % of painful shoulders, mechanisms leading to this pathological mineralization are still largely unknown. Research reported in the 90 s suggested that the formation of calcific deposits is linked to cells looking like chondrocytes identified around calcium deposits within a fibrocartilage area. They {{were considered to be}} derived from tenocytes but more recently, tendon stem cells, able to differentiate into chondrocytes, were isolated. The pro-mineralizing properties of these chondrocytes-like cells, especially the role of alkaline phosphatase, are not currently clarified. The calcium deposits contain poorly crystalline carbonated apatite associated with protein. Among these proteins, only osteopontin has been consistently identified as a potential regulating factor. During the disease, spontaneous resorption can occur with migration of apatite crystals into the subacromial bursa causing severe pain and restriction of movement. In in vivo and in vitro experiments, apatite crystals were able to induce an influx of leucocytes and a release of IL- 1 β and IL- 18 through the activation of the NLRP 3 inflammasome.

Wistar rats Achilles tendons (n?=? 6 /group) were injected with saline (control) or collagenase at peritendinous area of Achilles tendons. After 1 ?h animals were treated with two different doses of LLLT (810 ?nm, 1 and 3 ?J) at the sites of the injections, or with intramuscular sodium diclofenac. Regarding biochemical analyses, LLLT significantly decreased (p?<? 0. 05) COX- 2, TNF-a, MMP- 3, MMP- 9, and MMP- 13 gene expression, as well as prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) production when compared to collagenase group. Interestingly, diclofenac treatment only decreased PGE 2 levels. Biomechanical properties were preserved in the laser-treated groups when compared to collagenase and diclofenac groups.

We studied supraspinatus tendons from patients experiencing pain before and after surgical subacromial decompression treatment. Tendons were classified as having early, intermediate, or advanced disease, and inflammation was characterized through activation of pathways mediated by interferon (IFN), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), glucocorticoid receptor, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT- 6). Inflammation signatures revealed expression of genes and proteins induced by IFN and NF-κB in early-stage disease and genes and proteins induced by STAT- 6 and glucocorticoid receptor activation in advanced-stage disease. The proresolving proteins FPR 2 /ALX and ChemR 23 were increased in early-stage disease compared to intermediate- to advanced-stage disease. Patients who were pain-free after treatment had tendons with increased expression of CD 206 and ALOX 15 mRNA compared to tendons from patients who continued to experience pain after treatment, suggesting that these genes and their pathways may moderate tendon pain. Stromal cells from diseased tendons cultured in vitro showed increased expression of NF-κB and IFN target genes after treatment with lipopolysaccharide or IFNγ compared to stromal cells derived from healthy tendons.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of inflammation to {{the pathogenesis of}} tendinopathy and high prevalence of re-injury is not well established, although recent evidence suggests involvement of prostaglandins. We investigated the roles of prostaglandins and inflammation-resolving mediators in naturally occurring equine tendon injury with disease stage and age. Levels of prostaglandins E(2) (PGE(2)), F(2 α) (PGF(2 α)), lipoxin A(4) (LXA(4)) and its receptor FPR 2 /ALX were analysed in extracts of normal, sub-acute and chronic injured tendons. To assess whether potential changes were associated with altered PGE(2) metabolism, microsomal prostaglandin E synthase- 1 (mPGES- 1), prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH), COX- 2 and EP(4) receptor expression were investigated. The ability of <b>tendons</b> to resolve <b>inflammation</b> was determined by assessing FPR 2 /ALX expression in natural injury and IL- 1 β stimulated tendon explants. Alterations in the profile of lipid mediators during sub-acute injury included low PGE(2) and elevated LXA(4) levels compared to normal and chronic injuries. In contrast, PGF(2 α) levels remained unchanged and were three-fold lower than PGE(2). The synthetic capacity of PGE(2) {{as measured by the}} ratio of mPGES- 1 :PGDH was elevated in sub-acute injury, suggesting aberrations in tendon prostaglandin metabolism, whilst COX- 2 and EP(4) receptor were unchanged. Paradoxically low tendon PGE(2) levels in early injury may be attributed to increased local clearance via PGDH or the class switching of lipid mediators from the prostaglandin to the lipoxin axis. PGE(2) is therefore implicated in the development of <b>tendon</b> <b>inflammation</b> and its ensuing resolution. Whilst there was no relationship between age and tendon LXA(4) levels, there was an age-associated decline in FPR 2 /ALX receptor expression with concurrent increased PGE(2) levels in injury. Furthermore, uninjured tendon explants from younger (< 10 years) but not older horses (≥ 10 years) treated with IL- 1 β responded by increasing FPR 2 /ALX suggesting aged individuals exhibit a reduced capacity to resolve inflammation via FPR 2 /ALX, which may present a potential mechanism for development of chronic tendinopathy and re-injury...|$|R

Herein, we studied bioactive lipid mediator (LM) profiles of tendon-derived stromal cells isolated from healthy donors and patients with chronic tendinopathy. Interleukin(IL) - 1 β treatment markedly induced prostaglandin biosynthesis in diseased compared to healthy tendon cells, and up regulated the formation of several pro-resolving mediators including 15 -epi-LXA 4 and MaR 1. Incubation of IL- 1 β stimulated healthy tendon cells with 15 -epi-LXA 4 or MaR 1 down-regulated PGE 2 and PGD 2 production. When these mediators were incubated with diseased cells, we only found a modest down regulation in prostanoid concentrations, whereas it led to significant decreases in IL- 6 and Podoplanin expression. In diseased tendon cells, we also found increased 15 - Prostaglandin Dehydrogenase (15 -PGDH) expression as well as increased concentrations of both 15 -epi-LXA 4 and MaR 1 further metabolites, 15 -oxo-LXA 4 and 14 -oxo-MaR 1. Inhibition of 15 -PGDH using either indomethacin or SW 033291 significantly reduced the further conversion of 15 -epi-LXA 4 and MaR 1 and regulated expression of IL- 6, PDPN and STAT- 1. Taken together {{these results suggest that}} chronic inflammation in musculoskeletal soft tissues may result from dysregulated LM-SPM production, and that inhibition of 15 - PGDH activity together with promoting resolution using SPM represents a novel therapeutic strategy to resolve chronic <b>tendon</b> <b>inflammation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Nanotechnology is the study, {{production}} and controlled manipulation of materials {{with a grain}} size 3 ̆c 100 nm. At this level, the laws of classical mechanics fall away and those of quantum mechanics take over, resulting in unique behaviour of matter in terms of melting point, conductivity and reactivity. Additionally, and likely more significant, as grain size decreases, the ratio of surface area to volume drastically increases, allowing for greater interaction between implants and the surrounding cellular environment. This favourable increase in surface area {{plays an important role}} in mesenchymal cell differentiation and ultimately bone-implant interactions. Basic science and translational research have revealed important potential applications for nanotechnology in orthopaedic surgery, particularly with regard to improving the interaction between implants and host bone. Nanophase materials more closely match the architecture of native trabecular bone, thereby greatly improving the osseo-integration of orthopaedic implants. Nanophase-coated prostheses can also reduce bacterial adhesion more than conventionally surfaced prostheses. Nanophase selenium has shown great promise when used for tumour reconstructions, as has nanophase silver in the management of traumatic wounds. Nanophase silver may significantly improve healing of peripheral nerve injuries, and nanophase gold has powerful anti-inflammatory effects on <b>tendon</b> <b>inflammation.</b> Considerable advances must be made in our understanding of the potential health risks of production, implantation and wear patterns of nanophase devices before they are approved for clinical use. Their potential, however, is considerable, and is likely to benefit us all in the future. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2014; 96 -B: 569 - 73...|$|R
40|$|Cartilage {{superficial}} zone protein/proteoglycan (SZP) or proteoglycan 4 (PRG 4), {{has been}} demonstrated to {{have the potential for}} several distinct biological functions including cytoprotection, lubrication and matrix binding. In the present study, we have examined both the immunolocalisation and the mRNA expression pattern of PRG 4 in tissue harvested from the compressed and tensional regions of young and mature bovine tendons. Immunohistochemical analyses, utilizing monoclonal antibody 3 -A- 4 which recognizes a conformational-dependent epitope on native PRG 4, demonstrated that PRG 4 is present predominantly at the surface of fibrocartilaginous regions of tendon, with the intensity of immunoreactivity in this region increasing with age. RT-PCR analyses revealed that the expression of PRG 4 mRNA can be modulated by exposure to cytokines and growth factors. In addition, analyses of human pathological tendon revealed that PRG 4 may also be expressed as an alternatively spliced form lacking exons which encode part of the N-terminal matrix-binding and cell-proliferative domain; however, it remains to be determined whether such splice variants are a feature of human tendon, regardless of disease state. Taken together, these data indicate that PRG 4 may play an important cytoprotective role by preventing cellular adhesion to the tendon surface as well as providing lubrication during normal tendon function, in a manner complimentary to cartilage PRG 4. Structural modifications to SZP, together with a reduction in synthesis during <b>tendon</b> <b>inflammation</b> with injury and disease may account for the formation of tendon adhesions and contribute to the overall dysfunction of the tissue...|$|R
