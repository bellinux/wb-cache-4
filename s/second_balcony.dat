The Minaret of Qaytbay also has three balconies, supported by muqarnas, a form of stalactite vaulting which provide a smooth transition from a flat surface to a curved one (first recorded to {{have been used in}} Egypt in 1085), that adorn the minaret. The first shaft is octagonal is decorated with keel-arched panels on each side, with a cluster of three columns separating each panel. Above this shaft is the second octagonal shaft which is separated from the first by a balcony and decorated with plaiting. A <b>second</b> <b>balcony</b> separates this shaft with the final cylindrical shaft, decorated with four arches. Above this is the third balcony, crowned by the finial top of the minaret.|$|E

The minaret is located on the south-eastern corner. Its upper portion was demolished in 1912, during the Bulgarian occupation in the First Balkan War, when it was converted into a church dedicated to Saint George, but rebuilt in 1913 when the Turks recovered the town. A <b>second</b> <b>balcony</b> was added to the minaret at that time.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{exterior}} {{scenes were}} shot in Vancouver, Canada's Chinatown while the crematorium scenes were shot on a soundstage. Interior {{shots of the}} gambling parlor were shot at the Welsh Irish Scottish English (W.I.S.E.) Hall, a community building in Vancouver. The production staff created a <b>second</b> <b>balcony</b> in the hall exclusively for the episode, with an agreement to tear it down once the episode was filmed. However, after the filming ended, the W.I.S.E. Hall's owners requested that the balcony be left in place [...] "for aesthetic reasons". The vase and tiles used in the episode were created entirely by the show's production department. The scene where a frog pops out of a victim's chest was created by using molds to create a fake human torso, which was then placed over the actor. For a close-up shot, the torso was placed on {{a table with a}} hole on it, allowing the show's animal wrangler to push a live frog through the opening in the torso. Actors Michael Yama and Lucy Liu had to redo all of their dialogue in a Cantonese accent in post production. Their re-recorded lines were dubbed over the original soundtrack.|$|E

60|$|One {{night he}} went to the theatre, on the blind chance that he might see her there, and from the <b>second</b> <b>balcony</b> he did see her. He saw her come down the aisle, with Arthur and a strange young man with a {{football}} mop of hair and eyeglasses, the sight of whom spurred him to instant apprehension and jealousy. He saw her take her seat in the orchestra circle, and little else than her did he see that night--a pair of slender white shoulders and a mass of pale gold hair, dim with distance. But there were others who saw, and now and again, glancing at those about him, he noted two young girls who looked back from the row in front, a dozen seats along, and who smiled at him with bold eyes. He had always been easy-going. It was not in his nature to give rebuff. In the old days he would have smiled back, and gone further and encouraged smiling. But now it was different. He did smile back, then looked away, and looked no more deliberately. But several times, forgetting the existence of the two girls, his eyes caught their smiles. He could not re-thumb himself in a day, nor could he violate the intrinsic kindliness of his nature; so, at such moments, he smiled at the girls in warm human friendliness. It was nothing new to him. He knew they were reaching out their woman's hands to him. But it was different now. Far down there in the orchestra circle was the one woman in all the world, so different, so terrifically different, from these two girls of his class, that he could feel for them only pity and sorrow. He had it in his heart to wish that they could possess, in some small measure, her goodness and glory. And not for the world could he hurt them because of their outreaching. He was not flattered by it; he even felt a slight shame at his lowliness that permitted it. He knew, did he belong in Ruth's class, {{that there would be no}} overtures from these girls; and with each glance of theirs he felt the fingers of his own class clutching at him to hold him down.|$|E
