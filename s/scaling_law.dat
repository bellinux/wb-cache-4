This would prevent an Earth-like planet from forming in the habitable zone, however large moons of the gas giant could potentially support liquid water. On the other hand, it is unclear whether such massive moons could actually form around a gas giant planet, thanks to an apparent <b>scaling</b> <b>law</b> between the mass of the planet and its satellite system. In addition, measurements of the star's ultraviolet flux suggest that any potentially habitable planets or moons may not receive enough ultraviolet to trigger the formation of biomolecules. [...] Planet [...] "d" [...] would receive a similar amount of ultraviolet to the Earth and thus lies in the ultraviolet habitable zone, however, it would be too hot for any moons to support surface liquid water.|$|E

Since the seminal work of Gupta and Kumar, there have been active research efforts in developing capacity <b>scaling</b> <b>laws</b> for ad hoc networks under various advanced physical layer technologies.

We prove the correctness of our proposed criteria and demonstrate their usage through a number of case studies, such as ad hoc networks with directional antenna, MIMO, multi-channel multi-radio, cognitive radio, and multiple packet reception.

This notion of far more small things than large ones is also called spatial heterogeneity, which has been formulated as <b>scaling</b> <b>law.</b> Cartographic generalization or any mapping practices in general is essentially to retain the underlying scaling of numerous smallest, a very few largest, and some in between the smallest and largest.

40|$|<b>Scaling</b> <b>laws</b> {{characterize}} diverse {{complex systems}} {{in a broad}} range of fields, including physics, biology, finance, and social science. The human language is another example of a complex system of words organization. Studies on written texts have shown that <b>scaling</b> <b>laws</b> characterize the occurrence frequency of words, words rank, and the growth of distinct words with increasing text length. However, these studies have mainly concentrated on the western linguistic systems, and the laws that govern the lexical organization, structure and dynamics of the Chinese language remain not well understood. Here we study a database of Chinese and English language books. We report that three distinct <b>scaling</b> <b>laws</b> characterize words organization in the Chinese language. We find that these <b>scaling</b> <b>laws</b> have different exponents and crossover behaviors compared to English texts, indicating different words organization and dynamics of words in the process of text growth. We propose a stochastic feedback model of words organization and text growth, which successfully accounts for the empirically observed <b>scaling</b> <b>laws</b> with their corresponding scaling exponents and characteristic crossover regimes. Further, by varying key model parameters, we reproduce differences in the organization and <b>scaling</b> <b>laws</b> of words between the Chinese and English language. We also identify functional relationships between model parameters and the empirically observed scaling exponents, thus providing new insights into the words organization and growth dynamics in the Chinese and English language...|$|R

When going beyond the simple Skyrme model we find that restrictive constraints need to be imposed on the mesonic parameters in order to maintain these <b>scaling</b> <b>laws.</b> Furthermore, in the case when vector mesons are included in the model it turns out that the isoscalar form factor no longer scales according to these laws. Finally we note that, in addition to the exact <b>scaling</b> <b>laws</b> of the model, one may construct approximate local <b>scaling</b> <b>laws,</b> which depend of the particular choice of Lagrangian parameters.
