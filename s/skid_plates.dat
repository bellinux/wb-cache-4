2500|$|Some cranksets {{used for}} freeride and {{downhill}} mountain biking have a chainguide installed. A chainguide is a metal or plastic housing {{that keeps the}} chain on the chainrings over rough terrain and during technical riding. Most chainguides are designed for only one front chainring, {{but there are a}} few dual-ring chainguides available such as the E13 DRS and MRP LRP. [...] Chainguides include a channel on the top of the chainring to keep the chain in line (for models designed for one front chainring) and a roller or sprocket on the bottom to help keep the chain engaged with the chainring. These are almost always used in conjunction with bashguards. Exceptions including the E.thirteen LG-1 and the MRP G2 (and now the G2 SL) do exist which use integrated <b>skid</b> <b>plates,</b> removing impact forces from the crank's spider and transferring them to the frame.|$|E
2500|$|A 1976 Pacer {{was driven}} by Gordon Olsen and Bob Stone in the 1979 SCORE Baja 1000 Pro Class race and {{finished}} Class 6 (production cars) in second place, behind a Ford Ranchero truck. With {{a high rate of}} drop outs, [...] "anyone that officially finishes a Baja race is a winner." [...] Although many questioned [...] "What's a nice odd econo-car like you doing in an off-road race", the car was doing very well with Olsen swapping the lead with the V8 powered truck. However, an impact resulted in destruction of the Pacer's radiator giving the lead to the truck after 21 hours and 20 minutes of racing. The Pacer was sponsored by Costa Mesa AMC/Jeep and carefully prepared with the [...] I6 tuned to produce [...] as well as an automatic transmission, 15x8 aluminum wheels, higher ground clearance, a [...] capacity fuel tank, extra shock absorbers in the rear, and aluminum <b>skid</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Grand Cherokee {{was launched}} in 1992 as a 1993 model year vehicle in the luxury SUV segment. The [...] "ZJ" [...] models, manufactured from 1992 to 1998, originally came in three trim levels: base (also known as SE), Laredo, and Limited, subsequent trims were added, included Orvis (95–98), TSI (97–98). The base model included features such as full instrumentation, cloth interior, and a standard five-speed manual transmission, while gaining the moniker [...] "SE" [...] name for the 1994 model year. Power windows and locks were not standard equipment on the base trim. The minimal price tag differential resulted in low consumer demand, and as a result, the low-line model was eventually discontinued. Additional standard features included a driver-side air bag (starting in 96) and four-wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS). The Laredo was the mid-scale model with standard features that included power windows, power door locks, cruise control, and a leather wrapped steering wheel. Exterior features included medium-grey plastic paneling on the lower body and five-spoke alloy wheels. The Limited was the premium model, featuring body color lower body paneling, and gold exterior accents. The Limited also boasted standard features such as leather seating, heated mirrors, front power seats, a keyless entry system, wood grain interior appliqué, lace style alloy wheels, a driver information center with compass, digitized climate control, and electrochromic rearview mirror, and Jensen brand stereo with multi-band equalizer. By 1996 the option list grew to include heated seats. Standard was the 4.0, with the 5.2 V8 (and 5.9 in 1998) being optional. As with other models. Package groups with the various trim levels included: fog lamps, <b>skid</b> <b>plates,</b> as well as convenience, lighting, luxury, power, security, and trailer towing packages.|$|E

50|$|A danger with off-roading is {{damage to}} the vehicle from hitting rocks or other hard {{surfaces}} on very uneven terrain. A typical solution would be to install <b>skid</b> <b>plates</b> (sometimes also called bash plates), which are thick metal plates protecting vulnerable parts (such as the transfer/gear box or engine oil sump). Some manufacturers install <b>skid</b> <b>plates</b> as standard equipment on some of their vehicles. For many others this additional protection is available as an after-market accessory. <b>Skid</b> <b>plates</b> may be simple flat plates, but {{they may also be}} formed (by stamping or by welding multiple pieces) to protect shaped items like differentials. Fuel tank <b>skid</b> <b>plates</b> are a common factory option. In addition to <b>skid</b> <b>plates,</b> many off-roaders install differential covers that will not bend or break if they are smashed on rocks or other large objects. Since the axles on an off-road vehicle typically are the lowest hanging part of the vehicle making them susceptible to damage.|$|E
