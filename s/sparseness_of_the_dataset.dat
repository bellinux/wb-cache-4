40|$|Abstract- Outlier Detection has {{attracted}} substantial attention in many applications and research areas. Examples include detection of network intrusions or credit card fraud. Many {{of the existing}} approaches are based on pair-wise distances among all points in the dataset. These approaches cannot easily extend to current datasets that usually contain a mix of categorical and continuous attributes, and may be scattered over large geographical areas. In addition, current datasets usually have {{a large number of}} dimensions. These datasets tend to be sparse, and traditional concepts such as Euclidean distance or nearest neighbor become unsuitable. We propose ODMAD, a fast outlier detection strategy intended for datasets containing mixed attributes. ODMAD takes into consideration the <b>sparseness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dataset,</b> and is experimentally shown to be highly scalable with the number of points and number of attributes in the dataset...|$|E
40|$|Collaborative {{filtering}} {{is valuable}} in e-commerce, and for direct recommendations for music, movies, news etc. But today’s systems use centralized databases and have several disadvantages, including privacy risks. As we move toward ubiquitous computing, {{there is a}} great potential for individuals to share all kinds of information about places and things to do, see and buy, but the privacy risks are severe. In this paper we introduce a peer-to-peer protocol for collaborative filtering which protects the privacy of individual data. A second contribution of this paper is a new collaborative filtering algorithm based on factor analysis which appears to be the most accurate method for CF to date. The new algorithm has other advantages in speed and storage over previous algorithms. It is based on a careful probabilistic model of user choice, and on a probabilistically sound approach to dealing with missing data. Our experiments on several test datasets show that the algorithm is more accurate than previously reported methods, and the improvements increase with the <b>sparseness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dataset.</b> Finally, factor analysis with privacy is applicable to other kinds of statistical analyses of survey or questionaire data scientists (e. g. web surveys or questionaires) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} <b>the</b> performance assessment <b>of</b> innovative model-based algorithms {{developed for}} pose estimation of uncooperative targets by processing sparse three-dimensional point clouds. This topic is <b>of</b> interest in <b>the</b> framework <b>of</b> advanced space applications, e. g. on-orbit servicing and active debris removal, which require a chaser spacecraft to execute autonomous relative navigation maneuvers in close-proximity {{of a space}} target. Both <b>the</b> problems <b>of</b> pose acquisition and tracking are addressed. The former one is carried out by combining <b>the</b> concepts <b>of</b> principal component analysis and template matching in order to limit both the computational effort and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> on-board data storage compared with traditional approaches.

40|$|Logistic {{regression}} analysis and classification methods using decision tree analysis {{were used to}} generate two quantitative mineral potential maps for the Lake Ambrose area (NTS 12 A/ 10) of central Newfoundland. The response variable consisted of 47 surface mineral occurrences plus 49 randomly selected sites representing nonmineral occurrences. Mineral deposit models and regional exploration methods were used to choose a set of predictors consisting of geology fault proximity, till and lake sediment geochemistry, and surficial geology. A spatial weighting function predictor was developed {{to account for the}} clustering of the mineral occurrences. [...] The predictors were analyzed and recoded to derive a set useful in developing the quantitative models. The categorical geology predictor was converted into two binary predictors; felsic volcanics and mafic volcanics. Fault proximity was analyzed by the weights of evidence method to determine the optimal buffer threshold to convert the continuous distance values to a binary measure ‘close to faults’ versus ‘far from faults’. The optimal thresholds were the 400 m and 1000 m buffers. Principal components analysis was applied to the till and lake sediment geochemistry to derive component summary variables. Three component predictors were added to the database: till component 2 (TPC 2) representing base metal and gold, lake sediment component 2 (LPC 2) representing base metals and lake sediment component 4 (LPC 4) representing gold and its pathfinder elements. The till geochemistry predictors (Au, Cu, Pb, Zn and TPC 2) were analyzed for spatial autocorrelation and an interpolated surface was derived using kriging techniques. The lake sediment geochemistry predictors (Au, Cu, Pb, residual Zn, LPC 2 and LPC 4) 2343 converted to a surface by mapping their values on the catchment basins in which they were sampled. [...] The decision tree analysis indicated the spatial weighting function, felsic volcanics and the 400 m binary fault proximity predictor were significant predictors of mineral potential. Logistic {{regression analysis}} indicated that the spatial weighting function, felsic volcanics, the 1000 m binary fault proximity predictor and copper in till were significant predictors of mineral potential. The agreement, at the 96 sample sites, between these two modelling methods was 84. 3 %. The decision tree and logistic regression raster mineral potential maps were compared using Yule’s α. A value of 0. 54 indicates good agreement between the maps. Both models correctly classified approximately 79 % of the 96 mineral/nonmineral occurrences. Due to the <b>sparseness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dataset,</b> accuracy could not be measured as there were not enough samples to set aside a test dataset. [...] Mineral potential reliability maps were generated using the mutually exclusive and exhaustive regions from the decision tree analysis and the joint probability model from the logistic regression analysis. The mineral potential and reliability maps were combined (multiplied) the form a favourability map. The favourability maps from the decision tree and logistic regression analyses were combined to indicate overall zones of high mineral potential and high reliability. Mineral exploration claims cover much of the study area and only a minor part of the high favourability areas were not claimed as of September 2000...|$|E
