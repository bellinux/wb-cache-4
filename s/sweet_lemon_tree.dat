40|$|Mass grading of {{vegetables}} and fruits provide useful insight into designing of sizing machine and reducing the packaging and transportation costs. In this research, <b>sweet</b> <b>lemon</b> mass was correlated to different physical attributes using linear and nonlinear models as three different classifications: (1) single or multiple variable regressions of <b>sweet</b> <b>lemon</b> dimensional characteristics, (2) single or multiple variable regression of <b>sweet</b> <b>lemon</b> projected areas and (3) estimating <b>sweet</b> <b>lemon</b> mass based on its volume. The results showed that mass modeling of <b>sweet</b> <b>lemon</b> based on intermediate diameter and first projected areas are the most appropriate ones {{in the first and}} the second classifications, respectively. In third classification, the best model was obtained {{on the basis of the}} ellipsoid volume as M = 0. 903 Vellip + 15. 236 with R 2 = 0. 886, whereas corresponding values were 0. 86 and 0. 299 for assumed <b>sweet</b> <b>lemon</b> shapes (oblate spheroid and actual), respectively. In economical and agronomical point of view, suitable grading system of <b>sweet</b> <b>lemon</b> mass was ascertained based on intermediate diameter as nonlinear relation: M = 0. 002 b 2 + 6. 0386 b 239. 58, R 2 = 0. 8566 and R.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work is to design and develop a novel, cost effective strategy for fluoride removal from industrial waste water. This study investigates the feasibility of three low-cost biomass based adsorbents namely: banana peel, groundnut shell and <b>sweet</b> <b>lemon</b> peel for industrial waste water defluoridation at neutral PH range. Action of these adsorbents on fluoride was compared with commercially available adsorbents. It {{was found to be}} much better, high removal efficiency at higher concentration (20 mg/l) of fluoride in industrial waste water. The banana peel, groundnut shell and <b>sweet</b> <b>lemon</b> peel removed 94. 34, 89. 9 and 59. 59 %respectively. Contact time for banana peel, groundnut shell, and <b>sweet</b> <b>lemon</b> peel are 60. 0, 75. 0, and 40 min respectively at doses of 14, 12 and 16 gm/l respectively. Mechanism of adsorption kinetics was found pseudo-second order reaction, and the mechanism of fluoride removal on adsorbents was found to be complex. The surface adsorption as well as intra-particle diffusion contributes to the rate-determining step...|$|R
