30|$|Tracking {{the sun is}} {{the best}} way to {{increase}} the incident solar radiation on the still. Distillate productivity will increase significantly if <b>sun</b> <b>trackers</b> are used. There are two types of sun tracker: single-axis and dual-axis trackers. Single-axis <b>trackers</b> tracks the <b>sun</b> only from east to west, but dual-axis trackers tracks the exact location of the sun on a particular day at a particular time. So in dual-axis trackers the basin is always perpendicular to incident sun rays. Kalogirou (1996) has shown a design of a single-axis sun tracking system. Abdallah and Badran (2008) researched about a sun tracking system for productivity enhancement of solar still, and they found the increase in overall efficiency of 2 % of the still, which increases the productivity up to 22 %. Therefore, in the proposed still sun tracking system can be added. However, to maintain the simplicity of the design only the single-axis one-step azimuth tracker can be used.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The energy {{extracted}} from photovoltaic (PV) or solar thermal depends on solar insolation. For {{the extraction of}} maximum energy from the sun, {{the plane of the}} solar collector should always be normal to the incident radiation. <b>Sun</b> <b>trackers</b> move the solar collector to follow the sun trajectories and keep the orientation of the solar collector at an optimal tilt angle. Energy efficiency of solar PV or solar thermal can be substantially improved using solar tracking system. In this paper, an automatic solar tracking system has been designed and developed using DC motor on a mechanical structure with gear arrangement. The movements of two-axis solar trackers for the elevation and azimuth angles are programmed according to the mathematical calculation by using the Borland C++ Builder. Performance of the proposed system over the important parameter like solar radiation received on the collector, maximum hourly electrical power has been evaluated and compared with those for fixed tilt angle solar collector...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis work is {{performed}} {{to investigate the}} effect of using different types of sun tracking mechanisms on the flat plate photovoltaic system performances and the main parameters affecting the amount of their output electrical energy {{as well as those}} affecting their gains compared to the traditional fixed photovoltaic systems. The evaluation of different systems has been performed on the basis of hourly measured data over a complete one year obtained from Bouzareah location (Mediterranean coastal site). Considering all sky states, the monthly and yearly produced electrical energy by each one of the considered systems as well as the electrical gain of the photovoltaic panel mounted on different <b>sun</b> <b>tracker</b> systems were evaluated. From these latter, it appears that the highest gains obtained are those related to the two axes <b>sun</b> <b>tracker</b> system, which decrease gradually, from the inclined to the vertical rotating axis if the same optimum slope scheme is considered and from seasonal to the yearly optimum slope if the same rotating axis scheme is considered. So, from the obtained results, appears that if also, all sky states conditions were considered, compared to the single axis sun tracking systems, the gain obtained by the two-axis sun tracking system is relatively low and don’t exceed three percent for some cases. On the other hand, is also observed that the quantity of electrical energy produced by the different systems follows a seasonal variation and mainly related to the <b>sun</b> <b>tracker</b> mechanism under consideration, the choice of the panel slope, the availability amount of solar irradiation amount mainly the normal direct component, the day length and from the seasonal variation of the weather conditions...|$|E
