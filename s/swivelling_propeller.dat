50|$|In 1927 Engelbert Zaschka of Berlin built a helicopter, {{equipped}} with two rotors, {{in which a}} gyroscope was used to increase stability and serves as an energy accumulator for a gliding flight to make a landing. Gliding in this case means a straight descent. He wanted to develop an efficient propeller drive. A <b>swivelling</b> <b>propeller</b> at the rear provided propulsion and rudder control. The machine {{was a combination of}} an autogyro and a helicopter. The principal advantage of the machine, Zaschka says, is in its ability to remain motionless in the air {{for any length of time}} and to descend in a vertical line, so that a landing may be accomplished on the flat roof of a large house. In appearance, the helicopter does not differ much from the ordinary monoplane, but the carrying wings revolve around the body.|$|E
50|$|While {{elevators}} and <b>swivelling</b> <b>propellers</b> provide {{fine control}} of altitude, larger changes of height {{used to be}} controlled by either venting gas to lose altitude or dropping ballast to gain altitude. Large airships typically carried several water tanks fore and aft, allowing them to adjust longitudinal trim as well as height. Some modern designs instead pump lifting gas between the gas bags and storage cylinders.|$|R
25|$|Construction {{was delayed}} {{by a number}} of circumstances. Difficulties were {{encountered}} with the fabrication of the duralumin girders for the transverse frames, and there were many changes to the design, including strengthening the hull so that it could be handled safely by inexperienced crews, and replacing the original drive arrangement of paired propellers mounted {{on the sides of the}} hull with <b>swivelling</b> <b>propellers</b> mounted on the gondolas (as used on contemporary British Army dirigibles).|$|R
5000|$|Willows next airship the Willows No. 2 first flew on 26 November 1909. No. 2 was 86 ft (26.2 m) {{long and}} 22 ft (6.7 m) in {{diameter}} with a 29,000 cubic feet (820 mÂ³) volume. On 4 June 1910 Willows landed the No. 2 outside of Cardiff City Hall and then {{flew back to}} his shed at East Moors. On 11 July 1910 it flew from Cheltenham to Cardiff and the following month on 6 August it returned to London. The 122 mi flight was a record for a cross-country flight in Britain and Willows was the first aviator to cross the Bristol Channel in a powered aircraft. The No. 2 was powered by a JAP [...] air-cooled V8 engine and had two <b>swivelling</b> <b>propellers</b> mounted {{either side of the}} suspended car. It was also fitted with a rudder for directional control.|$|R
