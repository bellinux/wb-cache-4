40|$|AbstractThough {{genome-wide}} technologies, such as microarrays, {{are widely}} used, data from these methods are considered noisy; {{there is still}} varied success in downstream biological validation. We report a method that {{increases the likelihood of}} successfully validating microarray findings using real time RT-PCR, including genes at low expression levels and with small differences. We use a Bayesian network to identify the most relevant <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> based on the successes and failures in validation for an initial set of selected genes, and then improve our subsequent selection of genes for validation based on eliminating these <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise.</b> The network displays the significant <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> in an experiment, and scores the likelihood of validation for every gene. We show how the method can significantly increase validation success rates. In conclusion, in this study, we have successfully added a new automated step to determine the contributory <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> that determine successful or unsuccessful downstream biological validation...|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} in the ways different types of shrimp look and behave. Even within the core group of caridean shrimp, the small delicate Pederson's shrimp (above) looks and behaves quite unlike the large commercial pink shrimp or the snapping pistol shrimp. The caridean family of pistol shrimp are characterized by big asymmetrical claws, the larger of which can produce a loud snapping sound. The family is diverse and worldwide in distribution, consisting of about 600 species. Colonies of snapping shrimp are a major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> in the ocean and can interfere with sonar and underwater communication. The small emperor shrimp has a symbiotic relationship with sea slugs and sea cucumbers, and may help keep them clear of ectoparasites.|$|E
500|$|Set {{some time}} before {{the events of the}} first game, the main character, whose name is later {{revealed}} to be Jeremy Fitzgerald, has started working as a night watch security guard at the [...] "new and improved" [...] Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. The [...] "upgraded" [...] versions of the animatronic characters, which have special facial recognition software to protect the children from potential harm, were not programmed with a proper night mode; when things go silent, their programming tells them that they are in the wrong room and they seek out the nearest <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> to find people to entertain, which happens to be in the player's office. The player must again listen to the instructions of a [...] "phone guy", and attempt to defend themselves from the animatronics using several mechanics. Like the previous game, the player must survive from midnight to 6 AM. Jeremy is apparently moved to day shift after Night 6 as the animatronics' hostility becomes too dangerous, with the restaurant closing down shortly after.|$|E

40|$|For the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo CollaborationInternational audienceGravitational-wave (GW) {{searches}} are impaired by {{the presence}} <b>of</b> transient <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> that can masquerade as a GW signal.

Requiring a coincidence between the output of the Virgo and LIGO detectors does not completely eliminate their effect. It is therefore necessary to suppress them in the Virgo GW channel trigger list. Many of these events are due to <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> intrinsic to the detector, or environmental disturbances. We here show that many <b>of</b> these <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>noise</b> have been identified, looking at the Virgo GW and auxiliary channels.
