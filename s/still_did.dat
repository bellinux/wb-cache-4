5|$|If the Wartburg and Hambach rallies had {{lacked a}} {{constitution}} and administrative apparatus, that problem was addressed between 1867 and 1871. Yet, as Germans discovered, grand speeches, flags, and enthusiastic crowds, a constitution, a political reorganization, {{and the provision}} of an imperial superstructure; and the revised Customs Union of 1867–68, <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not make a nation.|$|E

5|$|The Peasant Popular Union and Social Democrats {{formed a}} left-wing {{coalition}} {{in opposition to}} the Christian Democrats. But the coalition <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not constitute a majority, and it went on to add representatives of minorities in Lithuania – Germans from the Klaipėda Region, Poles, and Jews. On 7 June, Kazys Grinius was elected the 3rd president of Lithuania and Mykolas Sleževičius became the prime minister. Both were members of the Peasant Popular Union.|$|E

He has never missed a mission launch, despite suffering a heart attack while jogging along Cocoa Beach in 1987, and being declared clinically dead for several minutes. Following his heart attack, he had bypass surgery, and <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not miss any launches.|$|E

He stepped down from the post of provost in 1970 at the age of 65, and became a professor emeritus in 1976. He <b>still</b> <b>did</b> some research at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and visited Caltech from time to time.

5|$|Having {{achieved}} {{stability in}} the West, Alexios could turn {{his attention to the}} severe economic difficulties and the disintegration of the Empire's traditional defences. However, he <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not have enough manpower to recover the lost territories in Asia Minor and to advance against the Seljuks. At the Council of Piacenza in 1095, envoys from Alexios spoke to Pope Urban II about the suffering of the Christians of the East, and underscored that without help from the West they would continue to suffer under Muslim rule.|$|E
5|$|Implementing the {{provisions}} and mandates of the Nunn-Cohen Act, however, was neither rapid nor smooth. One {{of the first}} issues to surface was appointing an ASD (SO/LIC), whose principal duties included monitorship of special operations activities and low-intensity conflict activities of the Department of Defense. The Congress even {{increased the number of}} assistant secretaries of defense from 11 to 12, but the Department of Defense <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not fill this new billet. In December 1987, the Congress directed Secretary of the Army John O. Marsh to carry out the ASD (SO/LIC) duties until a suitable replacement was approved by the Senate. Not until 18 months after the legislation passed did Ambassador Charles Whitehouse assume the duties of ASD (SO/LIC).|$|E

5|$|In Bottomley's absence, {{his office}} {{explored}} {{the issue and}} resolved that Rhodesia could retain its representative in South Africa, but {{should not be allowed}} to appoint another in Lisbon; a consul was acceptable, they concluded, but only as part of the British Embassy staff. Bottomley remained unaware of this progress until a call from his office on 25 June, whereupon he <b>still</b> <b>did</b> nothing. Unwilling to wait, Rhodesia confirmed Reedman's appointment the next day, much to Wilson's fury. Only now was Bottomley finally jolted into action; he informed Salisbury of his ministry's findings on 29 June, offering them the consul within the embassy, but refusing to sanction an independent office.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} war league after the {{outbreak}} of World War II (1940–41) Stockport finished in 35th place overall in the Northern Regional League after playing 29 games. League standings were calculated by goal average {{over the course of}} games played, with some teams playing more than others. In 1945–46, English football <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not have a football season; however, The FA Cup competition was resumed. Stockport was eliminated from the 1945–46 FA Cup in the first round after a 3–2 aggregate loss to Rochdale. The first post-war league season 1946–47 saw Stockport finish fourth in Division 3 (North) with 24 wins and 50 points.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this moment}} that the timely arrival of the Dutch General Chassé turned the tide in favour of the Anglo-allied army.Chassé's {{relatively}} fresh Dutch division was sent against them, led by a battery of Dutch horse-artillery commanded by Captain Krahmer de Bichin. The battery opened a destructive fire into the 1st/3rd Grenadiers' flank. This <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not stop the Guard's advance, so Chassé ordered his first brigade (Colonel Hendrik Detmers) to charge the outnumbered French with the bayonet; the French grenadiers then faltered and broke. The 4th Grenadiers, seeing their comrades retreat and having suffered heavy casualties themselves, now wheeled right about and retired.|$|E

5|$|Love in Several Masques was Fielding's first play, and {{was first}} {{released}} on 16 February 1728. Though {{the play was}} never revived and only ran for four nights, it <b>still</b> <b>did</b> moderately well especially {{when compared with the}} competing plays at that time. In the play, three respectable males each meet a female counterpart three times, and share a parallel incident with letters and an unmasking. Fielding focuses on men and how he believes they should prove their worth before marriage. It also highlights Fielding's belief in the relationship of morality and libertine beliefs and introduces character types that Fielding would use throughout his plays and novels.|$|E

At the time, the various online mapping services <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not show a complete freeway in eastern Ottawa or southern Kent counties. Services such as Mapquest and Yahoo! Maps rely on Tele Atlas out of New Hampshire for their mapping information, which, in turn, relies on agencies like MDOT to update their data.

5|$|OTU squadrons, {{according}} to GOC Bowhill, {{should have been}} prepared to deliver an output of three crews per month for torpedo and fighter squadrons and two for General Reconnaissance units. Only at this point did the Air Ministry revise its policy. They did so, however, in a manner which indicated it <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not appreciate {{the problems of the}} Command. Bomber Command had received several months of 'working up' and breathing space from the declaration of war to the German invasion of Western Europe, but Coastal Command had not. Furthermore, Bomber Command was given permission to merge several new squadrons into OTUs. It seemed as if Bomber Command was still receiving better treatment.|$|E

After Earp and Sadie moved into a bungalow nearby, Charlie Welsh's daughter, Grace Spolidora, recalled that Sadie, who had never had many domestic skills, did very little housekeeping or cooking for Wyatt. She and her sister Alma were concerned about the care Sadie gave Wyatt. Though he was at times very ill, she <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not cook for him. Spolidora, her sisters, and her mother brought in meals.|$|E
5|$|After the 1999 draft, the Rockets {{traded for}} the third overall pick Steve Francis from the Vancouver Grizzlies, in {{exchange}} for four players and a first round draft pick. However, after Houston traded a discontented Pippen to Portland (stating chemistry problems with old rival and now teammate Barkley), and Barkley suffered a career-ending injury, the rebuilt Rockets went 34–48 and missed the playoffs, {{for only the second}} time in 15 years. In the 2000–01 season, the Rockets worked their way to a 45–37 record, but <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not make the playoffs. In the following offseason, a 38-year-old Olajuwon requested a trade, and, despite stating their desire to keep him, the Rockets reached a sign and trade agreement, sending him to the Toronto Raptors. The proceeding season was unremarkable, as Houston's first season without Olajuwon in almost 20 years finished with a disappointing 28–54 record.|$|E
5|$|As {{literary}} studies {{developed into a}} discipline {{at the end of}} the nineteenth century, the story of the origins of Romanticism in England emerged along with it; according to this version of literary history, Coleridge and Wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age. This view held sway for almost a century. Even with the advent of feminist criticism in the 1970s, Barbauld <b>still</b> <b>did</b> not receive her due. As Margaret Ezell explains, feminist critics wanted to resurrect a particular kind of woman—one who was angry, one who resisted the gender roles of her time, and one who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women. Barbauld did not easily fit into these categories and it was not until Romanticism and its canon began to be re-examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice Barbauld had been.|$|E
