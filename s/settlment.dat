Radiocarbon dates for Paoli sites are from AD 900 until about 1250 when the Paoli phase evolved into the Washita River phase, dating from 1250 to 1450. Paoli village sites developed in place from earlier hunter-gatherer <b>settlments.</b> The Paoli and Washita River people lived in hamlets of up to ten thatched-roof houses typically built on terraces overlooking rivers. Hamlets often stood only a few hundred meters from each other indicating a fairly dense population. The Washita phase is distinguished from Paoli by differences in arrowheads, pottery, and architecture.|$|R

40|$|The {{central and}} eastern United States has {{experienced}} only 5 historic earthquakes with Mw 7. 0, four during the New Madrid sequence of 1811 - 1812 : three principal mainshocks and the so-called «dawn aftershock» following the first mainshock. Much of the historic earthquake research done in the United States {{has focused on the}} New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ), because the largest New Madrid earthquakes may represent the archetype for the most damaging earthquakes to be expected in intraplate regions. Published magnitude values ranging from 7. 0 to 8. 75 have generally been based on macroseismic effects, which provide the most direct constraint on source size for the events. Critical to the interpretation of these accounts is an understanding of their historic context. Early <b>settlments</b> clustered along waterways, where substantial amplification of seismic waves is expected. Analyzing the New Madrid intensity values with a consideration of these effects yields preferred values of Mw 7. 2 - 7. 3, 7. 0, and 7. 4 - 7. 5 for the December, January, and February mainshocks, respectively, and of 7. 0 for the «dawn aftershock». These values are consistent with other lines of evidence, including scaling relationships. Finally, I show that accounts from the New Madrid sequence reveal evidence for remotely triggered earthquakes well outside the NMSZ. Remotely triggered earthquakes represent a potentially important new wrinkle in historic earthquake research, as their ground motions can sometimes be confused with mainshock ground motions...|$|R
40|$|Austria between 1815 - 1848, i. e. {{before it}} became a great power, {{remained}} under the overwhelming influence of Chancellor K. Metternich and his policy towards various liberal and national movements. This was to {{be reflected in the}} so called Karlsbad <b>Settlments</b> of 1820 (Karlsbader Beschlüsse), the consequence of wich was the establishment of a police state and severe censorship that would resort even to the confiscation of manuscripts. Bernard Balzano's views concerning the state, the nation and religion challenged Metternich's regime. He was professor of philosophy an an academic priest in Prague and a civil servant at the same time. He popularized his liberal views in church. His sermons against totalitarianism demanded a constitution and equality of rights for different nations within the monarchy. Such views were rather inconvenient for the establishment since they might constitute a hotbed of rebellion. Therefore, in 1819 Bolzano was dismissed as a professor. Church community, who also found his opinions inconvenient, put him a his first serious trial, which however, was not able to make Bolzano recant his beliefs. From 1820 onwards Bolzano was subjekt to double censorship, namely censorship performed both by the state and the church. This censorship continued till the philosopher's death in 1848. All texts that Bolzano had published {{in the course of his}} life, came out in neighbouring Bavaria, governed in more liberal way. Being doomed by the double censorship to scholary non-existence, Balzano's ideals and views did not stand the chance to be easily reached by the posterity and this, in turn, impeded the reception of his thought, even in the German speaking countries...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{analysis}} of the in situ conserved plant landraces in Pollino National Park was carried out from 2009 to 2011. The sampling design, based on a standard landscape grid, captured {{the whole range of}} plant genetic resources monitored at a pluri-taxon level. Both old fruit trees, wines (I phase; see www. biodiversitapollino. it) and annual herbaceous plants (II phase) were monitored. Overall 119 georeferenced sampling units, each with a visible radius of 200 - 250 m represented the rural landscape of 21 municipalities in Basilicata and 3 in Calabria. Overall 41 different woody species comprising 519 traditional biotypes and 54 herbaceous species with 137 traditional cultivars were scored. Cultivar/species ratio is 10 : 1 for woody plants and 3 : 1 for herbaceous species. Diversity at the sub-specific level, averaged across the whole landscape was: Margalef = 80. 51; Menhinick = 9. 51; Shannon = 5. 55; Simpson = 0. 99; Briliouin = 5. 36. Landscape units with highest genetic diversity (species and landrace richness) were highlighted within a heterogeneous mosaic of cultivar richness distribution according to ecology and rural <b>settlments.</b> Linear regression (R 2 = 0. 78;r= 0. 43) between herbaceous cultivars richness vs old fruit trees richness confirmed that agribiodiversity is spatially conserved in landscape production units based on multi species rather than mono species (e. g. specialized) agro-ecosystems. In addition, the Colombian introductions (bean, potato, maize, pumpkin, tomato, and chili) increased species richness (R 2 = 0. 80; r= 0. 56) – without any displacement effect – within the landscape units already performing as a realized niche for the pre-colombian species (apple, pear, wheat, legumes, etc.) The core area of Mercure catchment basin – a realized niche for both pre and post Colombian species – connected with few units, each a-priori sized 4 x 4 Km, depicts the Pollino National Park agri-biodiversity genetic reserve...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the process and extent of sedentarisation among Fulani cattle owners in the derived savannah zone of {{south-west}} Nigeria. The results, based on a survey of 66 randomly-selected cattle owners, indicate an on-going process of <b>settlment.</b> Previously cattle owners visited the zone for dry season grazing but an increasing number were found to be settling and becoming mixed livestock/crop farmers. Generally herd sizes were larger among recent settlers but with longer duration of settlement and with cattle rearers' involvement in crop production, the herds became less mobile between seasons and herd size decreased and the proportion of farms with mixed Zebu/trypanotolerant cattle herds increased. There was also evidence that some indigenous Yoruba crop farmers were becoming mixed farmers by purchasing cattle, hiring Fulani herdsmen for management, then taking up the management themselves...|$|E

40|$|Barnacle cypris larvae {{respond to}} many cues when {{selecting}} a settlement site. The settlement of {{over a million}} larvae on tiles of different textures, orientations and densities of incumbent settlers was measured on the rocky intertidal at Great Cumbrae, Scotland. Half of the tiles were replaced every tide whereas the others simultaneously accumulated settlers. Factor effects varied on each tide, and converged in the accumulating deployment. Increasing incumbent density led to net loss of settlement, which was less probable on the textures on which fastest <b>settlment</b> occurred ('very fine'), and more probable on those on which settlement was slowest ('smooth'). More settlement occurred on down-facing orientations during daylight and vice versa. Cue ranks were non-linear, so a path analysis model quantified the relative influence of each factor. Gregariousness was the most influential cue measured, although unmeasured factors had greater effects, highlighting the complexity of settlement influences in this species. © 2009 Taylor & Francis...|$|E

Current addresses, also defined in Leipzig Charter on Sustainable European Cities in 2007, indentify the necessity to invest in requalification of degraded residential assets and not in new developments, individuating in urban regeneration the main tool for development of contemporary city. Public neighborhoods have developed, historically, a wide set of common problems. They are not only due to wrong planning but also to the concept of “housing for masses”.   The original ambition of modern <b>settlment,</b> developed from GermanSiedlung, was to be an autonomous part, on {{the point of view of}} morphology, in urban expansion. Joined by new developments, a lot of neighborhoods became benchmarks for suburban areas and now we can define themas “new urban centralities”.

The larval history of Gnathodentex aurolineatus (Lethrinidae), a {{widespread}} species of the coral reefs in Reunion Island (SW Indian Ocean), was revealed by otolith analysis. Pairs of otoliths from 108 fishes were collected during a peak settlement in Saint-Paul Bay. Standard length (SL) ranged from 62. 5 to 70. 7 mm and total length from 73. 7 to 85. 5 mm. Morphometric analysis of both all fishes and their otoliths, suggested that the. -samples came from a single cohort. Transverse sections of sagitta (embedded in thermoplastic glue (Crystal Bond) and polished) were analysed. Daily periodicity of increments formation in otoliths was validated by alizarin red labelling. Daily increments were observed under a light microscope and counted to estimate age, age at settlement, larval life duration and laying, hatching and settlement dates. A settlement mark was visible on otolith sections. Fish age ranged between 55. 2 and 59. 4 days. The pelagic larval stage was estimated to 40. 0 +/- 2. 5 days. Laying dates were estimated to occur in December 2002, between the 23 (rd) and the 27 (th), {{a few days before}} the new moon period. Hatching dates were estimated to occur between December 24 and 28, and the first feeding dates between December 26 and 30. Colonization took place in January 2003, between the 15 (th) and the 19 (th), during the full moon period. The back-calculated laying size was comprised between 0. 83 and 2. 41 mm SL. The back-calculated settlement size found in this study in the bay (between 44. 60 and 50. 44 min SL) was lower than the settlement size found in the lagoon zone (80 min). Width increments on otolith sections were measured to establish otolith growth. Otolith growth (mean: 1. 1 +/- 0. 1 mm. d(- 1)) was divided in two parts, showing significantly different growth rates. A first phase of rapid growth 1. 4 +/- 0. 1 mm. d(- 1) during the pelagic stage, followed by a slowed down growth 0. 7 +/- 0. 2 mm. d(- 1) after settlement.

40|$|The Danube {{has more}} „international” {{character}} {{than any other}} great river, strung along water course four national capitals (Vienna, Bratislava, Budapest,Belgrad), several other cities and hundreds of towns and villages, passes through human habitation of widely varying levels of development. The Danube is the second largest water course in Europe (after the Volga) in terms of length (2860 km), drainage basin (817, 000 km 2) and multiannual mean dischrge (6, 510 m³/sec. entry into Danube Delta). Through the latitudinal development of the Danube River Basin, in the Western and Central European space with different climate conditions (ocean and continental temperate), the liquid discharge regime, with high waters during {{spring and early summer}} is reflecting a moderate variation (K=Qmax/Qmin- 8. 9 at Ceatal Chilia). The Danube is a navigable waterway of significant importance and since ancient times it has helped form links between the populations inhabiting its banks. Traces of <b>settlment</b> date backs thousands of years as people were attracted by fertile floodplains and terraces,the wildlife in wilow forest and the wealth of fish populating the river itself and many great lakes. Unfortunately, this was not always been a bridgeway. There had been times,and they spaned five hundred yeares,when the lower course divided peoples. The Romans turned the river into a political frontier,not easily surmounted because of the force resistance put up by the autochtonous populatoin, the Dacians, in particular. Therefore, the Empire set up a fleet on the Danube,built strategic roads and bridges-one at Drobete-Turnu Severin(Traian`s Bridge), due to Appolodorus from Damascus, and another at Celei,near Corabia. The European Danube Commission (EDC),set up in 1856,was assigned the task of management of navigation on the river and undertaking of correction works to this end. The Commission discharged its duties until 1948, when the Belgrade Convention legiferated the rights of riparian states. This form of organization stimulated the development of several city-ports. Plans for connecting the Danube to Rhine and North Sea, respectively,go back to the reign Charlemagne(AD 793),realised and corrected in a few stages (1836 - 1845, 1959, 1992). Another goal was to shorten the distance to the Black Sea by having a canal built on the lower reaches of Danube, between Cernavodă and Constanţa(1974 - 1984). International cooperation in addressing water problems of the Danube took great steps forward through the Bucharest Declaration of 1985 and Helsiki Treaty of 1992. These paved the way for cooperation among the Danube basin countries. Danube River Basin Management Plan follows the deadlines set out in the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) of December 2000. The achievement of good water status in the water bodies of the Danube region by 2015 is coordinated by the ICPDR [...] The EU Strategy for Danube Region is to ensure the economic, social and cultural development of states and countries, situated in the drainage basin of the Danube River, by observing environment protection norms...|$|E
