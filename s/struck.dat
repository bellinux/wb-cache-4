5|$|Sets of 1d (one penny) to 4d silver coins {{are known}} {{from the time of}} Charles II onwards. However, as there is no record of any {{denomination}} higher than 1d (then <b>struck</b> for circulation in silver) being used in the Maundy gift before 1731, sets from before then are most likely ordinary circulation strikes. At that time, coins used for the Maundy money distribution were indistinguishable from those <b>struck</b> for circulation. It was not until 1752 that coins not <b>struck</b> for circulation were used for the Maundy distribution. At times when little silver was being <b>struck</b> by the Royal Mint, the coins distributed might bear a previous year's date. To evade statutory prohibitions on the striking of silver coin during the Napoleonic Wars, all Maundy pieces issued from 1800 to 1815 bear the date 1800, though most were <b>struck</b> later. When the date was finally changed in 1816, after the prohibition ended, the size of the coins was slightly reduced, as the Royal Mint increased the amount <b>struck</b> from one troy pound of sterling silver from 62 to 66 shillings of silver coin. The last year in which no Maundy coins were <b>struck</b> was 1821.|$|E
5|$|Some {{people believe}} that, for various reasons, large cities cannot be <b>struck</b> by tornadoes. More than 100tornadoes have been {{reported}} to strike downtown areas of large cities. Many cities have been <b>struck</b> twice or more, and a fewincluding Lubbock, Texas; St. Louis, Missouri; Topeka, Kansas; and London, Englandhave been <b>struck</b> by violent tornadoes (F4 or stronger).|$|E
5|$|The 200th {{anniversary of}} Braille's birth in 2009 was celebrated {{throughout}} the world by exhibitions and symposiums about his life and achievements. Among the commemorations, Belgium and Italy <b>struck</b> 2-euro coins, India <b>struck</b> a 2-rupee coin, and the USA <b>struck</b> a one dollar coin, all in Braille's honor.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Head gold pieces or Pratt-Bigelow {{gold coins}} were two {{separate}} coin series, identical in design, <b>struck</b> by the United States Mint: a two-and-a-half dollar piece, or quarter eagle, and a five-dollar coin, or half eagle. The quarter eagle was <b>struck</b> from 1908 to 1915 and from 1925–1929. The half eagle was <b>struck</b> from 1908 to 1916, and in 1929. The pieces remain the only US circulating coins with recessed designs. These coins {{were the last}} of their denominations to be <b>struck</b> for circulation, ending a series which had begun in the 1790s.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} proof coins were issued at the {{suggestion}} of Barber and Superintendent Bosbyshell. Ellsworth was enthusiastic, intending the special strikes as gifts, but was forced to share them with Company president Higinbotham, to Ellsworth's dismay. The proof coins for the year 1892 represented the first hundred coins <b>struck,</b> as well as numbers 400, 1492, and 1892. The total number of proof coins <b>struck</b> for 1893 is less certain: R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins states that approximately 100 proofs were <b>struck</b> for 1893, but numismatist Ira Goldberg in a 2011 article gives the number as fewer than ten. The first coin <b>struck</b> in the year 1893, in proof, is in the possession of the Chicago Historical Society. The Mint gave consideration to including the Columbian half dollar in proof sets, but at the time it sold proof coins for only a few cents above face value, and it would have to sell the proof Columbians for more than $1 so as to avoid devaluing the uncirculated commemoratives. Mint authorities decided against a public sale of proof Columbians.|$|E
5|$|After a small {{quantity}} was <b>struck</b> for circulation, the Mint received complaints {{regarding the}} prominent placement of Gobrecht's {{name on the}} dollar, and the design was modified to incorporate his name in a less conspicuous position. In January 1837, the legal standard for the percentage of precious metal in silver coins was changed from 89.2% to 90%, and the Gobrecht dollars <b>struck</b> after that point reflect this change. In total, 1,900 Gobrecht dollars were <b>struck</b> during the official production run. Production of the Seated Liberty dollar, which utilized the same obverse design as the Gobrecht dollar, began mintage in 1840. In the 1850s, Mint officials controversially re-struck the coins without authorization.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving slowly}} through the Caribbean Sea, Charley crossed Cuba on Friday, August 13 as a Category 3 hurricane, causing heavy damage and four deaths. That same day, it crossed over the Dry Tortugas, just 22hours after Tropical Storm Bonnie had <b>struck</b> northwestern Florida. It {{was the first time}} in history that two {{tropical}} cyclones <b>struck</b> the same state in a 24-hour period.|$|E
5|$|All pieces <b>struck</b> at the Philadelphia mint, without mintmark.|$|E
5|$|Although {{of little}} {{strategic}} value and undamaged {{during the early}} stages of World War II, {{in the final stages of}} the war a number of V-1 flying bombs and V-2 ballistic missiles <b>struck</b> the area. The worst attack occurred in February 1945, when a V-2 <b>struck</b> Westbeech Road, killing 17 and injuring 68. The bombsites were redeveloped with housing in then-current styles, rather than to Plumbe and Earle's designs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{usually more}} coins were <b>struck</b> at Philadelphia {{than at the}} other mints during the years the coin was <b>struck</b> in silver, only 12,450,181 were <b>struck</b> there in 1955, fewer than at the Denver Mint or at San Francisco. This was due to a sagging economy and a lackluster demand for coins that caused the Mint to {{announce}} in January that the San Francisco Mint would be shuttered {{at the end of}} the year. The 1955 dimes from the three facilities are the lowest mintages by date and mint mark among circulating coins in the series, but are not rare, as collectors stored them away in rolls of 50.|$|E
5|$|April 1998 Birmingham tornado – F5 tornado that <b>struck</b> western {{parts of}} Birmingham on April 8, 1998.|$|E
5|$|As {{the year}} was coming to a close, tragedy <b>struck.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} of the northeastern United States, the number of tornadoes peaks in the summer months, {{normally}} in July or August. Hartford County has had the most tornadoes in the state, although since 1950 Litchfield County has reported the most tornadoes. Several areas have been <b>struck</b> more than once, and Waterbury has been <b>struck</b> by no less than four tornadoes since 1955.|$|E
5|$|Assay Commission medals were <b>struck</b> from {{a variety}} of metals, {{including}} copper, silver, bronze, and pewter. The first Assay Commission medals were <b>struck</b> in 1860 at the direction of Mint Director James Ross Snowden. The initial purpose in having medals <b>struck</b> was not principally to provide keepsakes to the assay commissioners, but to advertise the Mint's medal-striking capabilities. The nascent custom lapsed when Snowden left office in 1861.|$|E
5|$|August 1, 1983: An F0 <b>struck</b> Middlesex County.|$|E
5|$|August 12, 1795– The {{state is}} <b>struck</b> {{by a major}} {{hurricane}} that produces heavy rainfall along its path.|$|E

5|$|August 31, 1803– The {{state is}} <b>struck</b> by a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the storm}} <b>struck,</b> Honduras was facing {{decreased}} food supplies due to ongoing El Niño conditions. The economy {{had been growing}} at a rate similar to the previous year until Mitch <b>struck,</b> and was largely dependent on exports. About 73% {{of the population was}} living in poverty when the storm <b>struck.</b> Hurricane Mitch set back the economies of various countries in the region, including Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador, after they had improved throughout the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} damaged in the engagement, {{although}} Saumarez's damage was almost entirely confined to his rigging: very few shots had actually <b>struck</b> his hull during the battle, {{and the only}} one that provoked notice passed across the deck without causing injury and <b>struck</b> a cannon on the opposite site, setting it off {{in the direction of a}} number of small gunboats that were approaching from the shore. Casualties on Crescent were equally light, with just one man injured; he had been standing too close to his own cannon during the opening broadside and had been <b>struck</b> by the recoiling gun, suffering a broken leg. Damage and losses on the French ship were very severe, with the rigging in tatters, the hull and lower masts repeatedly <b>struck</b> and casualties that Saumarez initially estimated at more than 120 men killed or wounded, although French accounts give the lower figure of 33 killed and 48 wounded.|$|E
5|$|By 6May, a {{total of}} five light {{aftershocks}} had occurred near the earthquake's epicenter. Of the five, the first registered a magnitude of 3.7(ML) and <b>struck</b> about 15 minutes after the main shock, and was succeeded by a magnitude 3.9(ML) tremor at 10:09 local time. Two similar quakes of minor intensity <b>struck</b> the region the next day; however, the strongest and final aftershock registered a magnitude of 4.1(ML) and occurred at 04:00 in the morning.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of the}} 18th century, {{the penny}} was a small silver coin rarely seen in circulation, and that was principally <b>struck</b> {{to be used for}} Maundy money or other royal charity. Beginning in 1787, the chronic {{shortage}} of good money resulted in the wide circulation of private tokens, including large coppers valued at one penny. In 1797 industrialist Matthew Boulton gained a contract to produce official pennies at his Soho Mint in Birmingham; he <b>struck</b> millions of pennies over the next decade. After that, it was not until 1825 that pennies were <b>struck</b> again for circulation, and the copper penny continued to be issued until 1860.|$|E
5|$|Five people {{perished in}} the country. Three men were killed in Taipei, two when they were <b>struck</b> by wind-blown objects and one when a house collapsed. Elsewhere, a {{fatality}} was reported because of a landslide in Taichung. Moreover, at least 15 other people were reportedly injured throughout Taiwan. A woman in the harbor city of Keelung was <b>struck</b> {{in the head and}} seriously injured by a broken window.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{investigation}} into Speyer's wartime conduct held in camera by the Home Office's Certificates of Naturalisation (Revocation) Committee, Speyer's naturalisation was revoked by an order dated 1 December 1921. On 13 December 1921 an order was issued by King George V for Speyer to be <b>struck</b> off {{the list of the}} Privy Council. The next person to be <b>struck</b> off the list was Elliot Morley in 2011, though others resigned in the intervening period.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, {{silver dollar}} {{production}} was temporarily restarted to supply a diplomatic mission to Asia {{with a special}} set of proof coins. Officials mistakenly believed that dollars had last been minted with the date 1804, prompting them to use that date rather than the date in which the coins were actually <b>struck.</b> A limited number of 1804 dollars were <b>struck</b> by the Mint in later years, and they remain rare and valuable.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, a {{small change}} {{was made to}} the design to add the {{initials}} of the designer (FS) to the obverse, underneath Jefferson's portrait. In commemoration of that change, two specimen 1966 nickels with the initials were <b>struck</b> and presented to him. Coins <b>struck</b> at any mint between 1965 and 1967 lack mint marks, which were omitted as the Mint replaced the silver circulating coins with copper-nickel. Beginning in 1968, mint marks were again used, and on the nickel were moved to {{the lower part of}} the obverse, to the right of Jefferson's bust. From 1971, no nickels were <b>struck</b> for circulation in San Francisco—the 1971-S was the first nickel <b>struck</b> in proof only since 1878.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, OO-DLL, a DHL Airbus A300, was <b>struck</b> by a {{surface-to-air missile}} shortly after departing from Baghdad International Airport, Iraq. The missile <b>struck</b> the port-side wing, rupturing a fuel tank and causing {{the loss of}} all three {{hydraulic}} systems. With the flight controls disabled, the crew used differential thrust to execute a safe landing at Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|In November 2003, the Mint {{announced}} {{the first two}} reverse designs, to be <b>struck</b> with Schlag's obverse in 2004. The first, designed by United States Mint sculptor-engraver Norman E. Nemeth, depicts an adaptation of the Indian Peace Medals <b>struck</b> for Jefferson. The second, by Mint sculptor-engraver Alfred Maletsky, depicts a keelboat like that used by the Expedition.|$|E
5|$|In Strasburg's {{second and}} third major league starts he <b>struck</b> out another eight and ten batters, respectively, setting a major league record for the most strikeouts in a pitcher's first three starts with 32. The {{previous}} record holder had been Richard, who <b>struck</b> out 29 in his first three starts in 1971.|$|E
5|$|In {{his five}} {{seasons with the}} Marlins, Beckett had a 41–34 record, a 3.46 ERA and <b>struck</b> out a total of 607 batters in 106 games. In his final start as a Marlin, on September 23, 2005, against the Atlanta Braves, he <b>struck</b> out six in seven shutout innings but earned a no {{decision}} in a game the Marlins eventually lost.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two months}} after Katrina <b>struck</b> south Florida, Hurricane Rita brushed the region in late September with {{tropical}} storm-force winds and flooding rains. In late October, Hurricane Wilma <b>struck</b> southwestern Florida as a major hurricane, affecting the Miami area with hurricane-force winds that left 98% of south Florida without power. Including Hurricane Dennis in July, FEMA provided $1billion in public assistance to Florida residents {{in association with the}} four hurricanes in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Iniki caused around $1.8billion (1992USD) {{of damage}} and six deaths. At the time, Iniki {{was among the}} costliest United States hurricanes, and it {{remains one of the}} costliest hurricanes on record in the eastern Pacific. The storm <b>struck</b> just weeks after Hurricane Andrew, the costliest {{tropical}} cyclone ever at the time, <b>struck</b> Florida.|$|E
