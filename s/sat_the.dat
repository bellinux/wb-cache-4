As a consequence of his upbringing, Roger spoke mainly French, and his English was heavily accented. In 1845 James decided that Roger should complete his education in England and placed him in the Jesuit boarding school Stonyhurst College, where he remained until 1848.

5|$|The England {{side was}} {{thoroughly}} shaken-up following the debacle in the Third Test at Old Trafford.

As well as Cowdrey replacing Emburey, the selectors also dropped Paul Downton, Martyn Moxon, Mike Gatting, David Capel, Phil Defreitas and John Childs in favour of Derek Pringle, Neil Foster, Bill Athey, and Jack Richards, with Tim Curtis and Robin Smith making their Test debuts.

30|$|Regarding the {{thickness}} of <b>the</b> <b>SAT</b> at <b>the</b> site where the axilla was opened, wide variation (8  mm to 60  mm) and correlation with the BMI were observed among the evaluated patients. This correlation is not observed for <b>the</b> <b>SAT</b> that covers <b>the</b> breast, as reported by Larson et al. (2011). Additionally, the average thickness of <b>the</b> <b>SAT</b> that covers <b>the</b> breast, as described by these authors (Larson et al. 2011), is 1  cm, which is much thinner compared with the average thickness of <b>the</b> <b>SAT</b> in <b>the</b> axillary region observed {{in the present study}} (25.9  mm). Therefore, knowing this difference is important because maintaining the same flap thickness in the breast and axillary regions may result in unnecessary removal of <b>the</b> <b>SAT</b> overlying <b>the</b> axillary fascia. Furthermore, it can result in accidental damage to the superficial lymphatic vessels located in <b>the</b> <b>SAT</b> (Suami et al. 2007 a) as well as in damage to the anastomoses present in this region between the superficial and deeper lymphatic vessels that drain lymph from the upper member (Suami et al. 2007 b; Pavlista & Eliska 2012), which theoretically may contribute to an increased risk of lymphedema of the arm. Although the optimum thickness of the flap after skin-sparing mastectomy for treatment of breast cancer {{has been the subject of}} numerous studies (Torresan et al. 2005; Carlson 2011) and controversies (Bleicher et al. 2003) because of the risk of local recurrence, determining {{the thickness}} of the flap at the surgical incision site for approaching the axillary lymph nodes is a topic that has not been addressed in the literature. The axillary fascia, which is an anatomical landmark that separates <b>the</b> <b>SAT</b> from <b>the</b> axilla itself at its base, is relatively thick and has been identified with “the naked eye” in the vast majority (93 %) of cases evaluated.|$|R
