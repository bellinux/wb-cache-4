5|$|The chief {{device of}} ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, {{including}} {{many of the}} psalms, was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, <b>sound</b> <b>structure,</b> notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to {{the point that they}} could be expressed as a context-free grammar) which ensured a rhythm. In Chinese poetry, tones as well as stresses create rhythm. Classical Chinese poetics identifies four tones: the level tone, rising tone, departing tone, and entering tone.|$|E

500|$|Berio {{described}} the main structure of Laborintus II as a [...] "catalogue, in its medieval meaning" [...] (exemplified by the Etymologies of Isodore of Seville), using Dante's themes of [...] "memory, death and usury". Members of the Dutch choir Nederlands Kamerkoor, which {{performed in the}} recording, have also cited usury as a key theme in the work, describing the composition as [...] "an indictment against the practice". Of the form, Berio wrote: [...] "Individual words and sentences are sometimes {{to be regarded as}} autonomous entities, and sometimes to be perceived as part of the <b>sound</b> <b>structure</b> as a whole." [...] The instrumentation of LaborintusII was written as an [...] "extension" [...] of the vocal material; its electronic section is likewise an extension of the instrumental music. [...] Berio used car tyres and a blow-up doll on stage in a performance of the work at the Holland Festival in 1973.|$|E

40|$|The ontological {{status of}} musical works is a {{controversial}} topic {{among those in}} the field. This paper aims to argue for a nominalist and non-reductive approach to musical works that differentiates musical works from the <b>sound</b> <b>structures</b> commonly equated with them. The difference between <b>sound</b> <b>structures</b> and musical works is heavily emphasized and I conclude that musical works have emergent attributes <b>sound</b> <b>structures</b> do not. These attributes being creatability, fine individuation, and the inclusion of performance means. After establishing this I begin to build an argument for a nonreductive approach to musical works by rejecting the extreme view held by compositional nihilists. Once I establish that musical works are entities in our ontology I argue against them being abstract. I end by defending the nominalist approach...|$|R

2500|$|Linguists {{focusing}} on structure {{attempt to understand}} the rules regarding language use that native speakers know (not always consciously). [...] All linguistic structures {{can be broken down}} into component parts that are combined according to (sub)conscious rules, over multiple levels of analysis. [...] For instance, consider the structure of the word [...] "tenth" [...] on two different levels of analysis. [...] On the level of internal word structure (known as morphology), the word [...] "tenth" [...] is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality. [...] The rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker [...] "th" [...] follows the number [...] "ten." [...] On the level of <b>sound</b> <b>structure</b> (known as phonology), structural analysis shows that the [...] "n" [...] sound in [...] "tenth" [...] is made differently from the [...] "n" [...] sound in [...] "ten" [...] spoken alone. [...] Although most speakers of English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of [...] "tenth", they are less often aware of the rule governing its <b>sound</b> <b>structure.</b> [...] Linguists focused on structure find and analyse rules such as these, which govern how native speakers use language.|$|E

40|$|The {{deployment}} of Workflow Management systems is a time-consuming and error-prone task. A possible solution is process mining, which automatically extracts workflow models from event-data logs. However, {{the current research}} in process mining still has problems in mining some common constructs in workflow models. Among these constructs are short loops, which are loops of length one and two. For instance, the α-algorithm was proven to mine <b>sound</b> <b>Structured</b> Workflow nets without short loops. In this paper, we present a new algorithm (the α +-algorithm) that can handle short loops, and we prove that it correctly mines all <b>sound</b> <b>Structured</b> Workflow nets.
