25|$|Latrodectus mactans, {{known as}} <b>southern</b> <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> or simply black widow, and the shoe-button spider, {{is a highly}} venomous species of spider in the genus Latrodectus. The females are well known for their {{distinctive}} black and red coloring and {{for the fact that}} they will occasionally eat their mate after reproduction. The species is native to North America. The venom is seldom fatal to healthy humans.|$|E
25|$|Other animals, {{including}} most insects and many fish, have larger females. This {{may be associated}} with the cost of producing egg cells, which requires more nutrition than producing sperm—larger females are able to produce more eggs. For example, female <b>southern</b> <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spiders are typically twice as long as the males. Occasionally this dimorphism is extreme, with males reduced to living as parasites dependent on the female, such as in the anglerfish. Some plant species also exhibit dimorphism in which the females are significantly larger than the males, such as in the moss Dicranum and the liverwort Sphaerocarpos. There is some evidence that, in these genera, the dimorphism may be tied to a sex chromosome, or to chemical signalling from females.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} insects, arachnids, and birds prey on these ants, {{especially}} when queens {{are trying to}} establish a new colony. Many species of dragonfly, including Anax junius, Pachydiplax longipennis, Somatochlora provocans, and Tramea carolina, capture the queens while they are in flight; 16 species of spiders, including the wolf spider Lycosa timuga and the <b>southern</b> <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spider (Latrodectus mactans), actively kill red imported fire ants. L. mactans captures all castes of the species (the workers, queens, and males) within its web. These ants constitute 75% of prey captured by the spider. Juvenile L. mactans spiders have also been seen capturing the ants. Other invertebrates that prey on red imported fire ants are earwigs (Labidura riparia) and tiger beetles (Cicindella punctulata). Birds that eat these ants include the chimney swift (Chaetura pelagica), the eastern kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus), and the eastern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus virginianus). The eastern bobwhite attacks these ants by digging out the mounds looking for young queens. Red imported fire ants have been found in stomach contents inside of armadillos.|$|E

40|$|The web of {{the black}} widow is {{apparently}} a random spatial arrangement of threads, which provides its occupant with housing, means to capture prey and protection. However to ensure that these functions are fulfilled, the spider has evolved to adapt {{the architecture of the}} web so that it would be able to adequately respond to the outer environment and to properly transmit the stresses within its structure. By performing the structural analysis of the web subjected to various external loads, a relationship between the web geometry and mechanical response may be established. For this study, a web model constructed based on data collected from a member of the species Latrodectus mactans (<b>southern</b> <b>black</b> <b>widow)</b> is tested under three loading conditions: uniaxial stretching, expansion in the three main directions and shearing effects of the wind action. In addition, to determine whether the response of the erratic ensemble of threads is efficient as compared to a more orderly system, a second structure constructed from elements of equal lengths organized in simplistic pattern is subjected to similar tests and results are compared. These tests indicate a complex flow of stresses throughout the network. Unlike the elements in the orderly system, which carry approximately the same amount of load, the individual response of the threads in the web varies significantly, with some experiencing very large stresses, while others not being loaded at all. This shows that the high degree of redundancy in the web allows for multiple possible load paths, redirecting stresses in certain regions of the structure, while maintaining others safe for the spider to continue inhabiting them. However, while certain patterns may be observed in the way load is carried throughout the web, these tests fail to establish a concrete correlation between geometry and stress flow. by Bogdan Andrei Demian.

25|$|As of 2012, {{researchers}} at the University of California, Riverside, suggested that the brown widow spider, newly established in Southern California, {{may in fact be}} displacing <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spiders from the region, competing and/or fighting for territory. While certainly not definitive, this evidence does suggest that the brown widow is likely to be more hostile and aggressive towards its relative, the <b>black</b> <b>widow,</b> than the <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> is towards it. If that proves to be true, humans may be positively affected because, over time, brown widows will aggressively eradicate and replace the <b>black</b> <b>widows</b> from the areas they inhabit, and since brown widows are less venomous than <b>black</b> <b>widows,</b> this may have the effect of making those areas safer.|$|R
