50|$|Two {{other similar}} species of Pyronia {{are found in}} {{southern}} Europe, the <b>southern</b> <b>gatekeeper</b> (P. cecilia) and the Spanish gatekeeper (P. bathsheba).|$|E
50|$|Pyronia cecilia, the <b>southern</b> <b>gatekeeper,</b> is a {{butterfly}} of Southern Europe and North Africa. It {{is a member}} of the subfamily Satyrinae in the family Nymphalidae.|$|E
50|$|It {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the gatekeeper (P. tithonus), which is found further north, and the Spanish gatekeeper (P. bathsheba). The gatekeeper has spots {{on the underside of}} the hindwing which the <b>southern</b> <b>gatekeeper</b> lacks. The Spanish gatekeeper has quite a different underwing pattern with a prominent while line.|$|E
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>gatekeeper</b> likes hot localities and {{is found}} in {{northern}} Africa and southern Europe; in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Portugal, Spain including Mallorca and Menorca, south-eastern France, Corsica, Sardinia, Elba, Italy, Sicily, Albanis, Greece and Turkey. It is usually found in rough, open areas in lowland regions although in some areas it occurs up to 2000 m.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>gatekeeper,</b> {{like many}} in {{subspecies}} Satyrinae, exhibits sexual dimorphism. The male {{is smaller than}} the female, the front wing of the male is 15 to 16 mm whereas a female front wing is 20 mm, and has a patch of scent-producing scales known as the androconia, which {{can be seen as}} a dark patch on the upperside of the forewing.|$|E
