25|$|Several {{influential}} {{people of}} the time, including Bell, viewed deafness as <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> eradicated, and also believed that with resources and effort, they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of sign language, thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded. Owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language, Bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing Deaf culture.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems, in particular the transverse relaxation time T2 (for NMR and MRI technology, also called the dephasing time), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature. Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.|$|E

25|$|The Land of Oz as {{portrayed in}} the classic MGM musical movie of 1939, is quite {{different}} from that portrayed in Baum's books. The most notable difference is that in the film the entire land of Oz appears to be dreamed up by Dorothy Gale (thus making it a dream world), although, Dorothy earnestly corrects the adults at the end that she was indeed there, and an image of Dorothy's falling farmhouse returning to earth is presented. The apparent message is that one should appreciate one's home, no matter how dull it may look or uninteresting its surroundings may be, for having a home and a family is not <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> taken for granted. This contrasts sharply with the books, in which Dorothy and her family are eventually invited to move to Oz due to a bank foreclosure on the farm, showing both that Oz is a real place, and that it is a utopia compared to the prairies of Kansas.|$|E
25|$|Lowell, even as {{far back}} as the 1860s, was {{described}} as a city with little civic pride. At the time, Cowley attributed it to a large percentage of the population being foreign born and therefore having no real roots there. Post its industrial collapse, that sentiment intensified, even if the reasons had changed. Many residents of Lowell viewed the city's industrial history poorly - the factories had abandoned their workers, and now sat empty and in disrepair. However, some city residents, such as educator Patrick J Mogan, viewed the city's history as <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> preserved and capitalized on. In 1974, Lowell Heritage State Park was founded, and in 1978, Lowell National Historical Park was created as an urban national park, through legislation filed by Lowell native, congressman, and later senator Paul Tsongas. The canal system, many mills, and some commercial structures downtown were saved by the creation of the park and the visitors it brought.|$|E

The major United Kingdom retailer Forbidden Planet offered the book at a discount because they felt it was <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> read, promoting it to customers by comparing it to George Orwell's Animal Farm and saying [...] Alanguilan uses [...] "the child fable-like idea ... to comment on morality, family and prejudice." [...] The comparison to Animal Farm was reiterated by SLG Publisher Dan Vado and critic Carl Doherty. In an interview with PhilStar Global, famed writer Neil Gaiman described the work as [...] "heartbreaking and funny", adding that it is [...] "beautifully drawn." [...] Veteran comic writer Steven Grant called it [...] "work of a mature talent".|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} storylines for the character of Bridget was when she discovered that she was pregnant with Declan's child. As the storyline progressed, Bridget was seen considering abortion or adoption, before ultimately deciding to have the child with Declan's support. This caused controversy among conservative family groups in Australia who accused the Neighbours of using their characters to normalise teenage pregnancy. Pro-Family Perspectives director Angela Conway said: [...] " [...] is not <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> considered the norm, programmes like Neighbours can make the behaviours that lead to teenage pregnancy seem normal and acceptable. A lot of kids just aren't ready to get their head around details of explicit sexuality." [...] Neighbours executive producer Susan Bower defended her character's storyline stating: [...] "I am quite sure {{a lot of people are}} not happy with this storyline. We decided we would show the ramifications on the teenagers' lives." [...] Mignon said that the storyline between Declan and Bridget was not shallow, trite or vulgar, further adding she would not have liked to film the storyline if it was and branded it as showing emotional spectrum of pregnancy justice. Critics also slammed the show, noting that Neighbours has a G-rating and the storyline could lead to more promiscuity and teenage pregnancies among young viewers. The storyline continued despite the controversy it caused and Declan and Bridget became parents to a daughter, India.|$|E

500|$|A {{high profile}} storyline for the {{character}} was when he got his girlfriend Bridget pregnant. The storyline progressed and saw the couple decide to have the child. This caused controversy and an 'outcry' from conservative family groups in Australia who accused the programme of using the characters to normalise teenage pregnancy. Speaking {{on behalf of the}} groups, Pro-Family Perspectives director Angela Conway said: [...] " [...] is not <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> considered the norm, programmes like Neighbours can make the behaviours that lead to teenage pregnancy seem normal and acceptable.

500|$|A comment he {{made during}} the debate became another {{campaign}} issue for Thompson. He again apologized for remarks, this time over an {{answer to a question}} in which he stated that he believed the decision to fire a gay worker based on the morals of the employer is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> [...] "left up to the individual business." [...] A few days following the debate, the candidate rescinded the comments, and blamed the gaffe on a malfunctioning hearing aid, stating that he [...] "didn't hear the question." [...] Thompson also said that he was sick during the debate, having been hospitalized three days earlier with the flu and bronchitis, and that all he could think about [...] "was getting off the stage." [...] Campaign adviser Steve Grubbs would later point to this episode as the moment Thompson's campaign became [...] "unrecoverable." [...] Thompson was harshly criticized for the remarks. Jason Stephany, the political director of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, rhetorically asked [...] "How many times is he going to say something that's completely offensive to the majority of Americans before people start to say, 'What's going on here?'" [...] Thompson tried to reassure the public that there was [...] "nothing discriminatory about [...] at all." [...] Afterwards, he finished second in a poll of state convention members from Wisconsin, with 84 of the 306 members polled, trailing Fred Thompson who received 95 votes. He stood at 16% in an average of statewide polls for the state in May, and stood at 4.3% in Iowa, where he based his campaign.|$|E
500|$|On the {{birthday}} of Albizu, the Macheteros issued a message discussing the approach of other pro-independence organizations that had moved away from armed resistance. The EPB considered those that had done so as having abandoned the ideals of Albizu and Betances, instead adopting a [...] "defeated and conformist approach" [...] {{in the face of}} the challenge involved in securing independence for Puerto Rico. Accepting that [...] "violence is not <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> accepted by anyone sane", the organization insisted that they were not the source of violence and were instead responding to it. The EPB argued that most of the public had been [...] "conditioned to accept the [...] "pacific route" [...] towards liberty and independence", citing it as an inefficient and dilatory method that would lead to the [...] "suicide and self-destruction" [...] of Puerto Rican identity. The organization expressed that all of the political structure and the format of the general elections was created by the United States, citing skepticism that independence could win under such circumstances. Citing that inaction resulted in an exacerbation of social, eviromental and economic problems emerging from the status quo, the EPB justified its use of violence as a means [...] "for self preservation". On September 23, 2000, the EPB celebrated Lares as the moment that illustrated the birth of Puerto Rico as a nation. The organization also held an introspection where it questioned why the independence movement was segregated into several factions and speculated that it was the system's fault, since [...] "it promotes individualism over collectivity", arguing that this is the reason why the federal government continues to vigorously promote it. The EPB then listed Vieques as an example of a weakening of this tendency and an example of the independence movement converging around a cause without pursuing protagonism. The organization interpreted approaches made by the Navy involving the devolution and decontamination of terrains as a distraction to divide the protestors and sign that there [...] "was fear in Washington", accusing Rosselló and legislators such as Mundo and Parga of facilitating this strategy. The Macheteros also praised the manner in which the religious movements and the PIP handled the situation, despite acknowledging philosophical differences with the latter.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{widespread}} belief that Leonardo was primarily if not exclusively sexually attracted to and involved with men.

His possible sexual interest in men is addressed in detail in episode five of season one when he is tried for sodomy. Leonardo describes his sexual relationship with men as a curiosity, as he states [...] "No one defines me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jean Piaget (1896–1980) {{developed}} {{the theory of}} cognitive development. The theory stated that intelligence developed in four different stages. The stages are the sensorimotor stage from birth to 2 years old, the preoperational state from 2 years old to 7 years old, the concrete operational stage from 7 years old to 10 years old, and formal operational stage from 11 years old and up. He also believed that learning was constrained to the child's cognitive development.
