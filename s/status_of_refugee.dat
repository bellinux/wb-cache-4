However, {{there is always}} a possibility that under certain circumstances an alien enters a State without having any permit {{as it is in the}} case of refugee. Refugees have the right to be given protection as attached to their refugee status. The refugee rights for protection by the host state is included in various regional and International treaties such as Conventin relating the <b>Status</b> <b>of</b> <b>Refugee</b> 1951 and Protocol relating the <b>Status</b> <b>of</b> <b>Refugee</b> 1967. In reality, the refugee problem is more complex as it relates to legal issues such as those in regard to asylum seeker, stateless persons, illegal immigrant, and extradition. In many cases, there are difficult problems in deciding whether or not an individual or a group of aliens to be given the refugee status. In an effort to solve the refugee problems around the world, the United Nations established the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee (UNHCR).

40|$|The {{protection}} of refugee is {{the duty to}} all civilized nation in the world. It is a human rights and humanitarian value that every state must take responsible with. Among several kinds of protections, there {{is one of the}} most important one which is stated in article 33 of the 1951 Convention on the <b>Status</b> <b>of</b> <b>Refugee,</b> the non-refoulment principle. This principle has became customary international and also has been received the jus cogens status. The purpose of this thesis is to understand the role of Jus cogens principle of non-refoulment will effect Indonesia in giving assistance to the Rohingya refugees and to understand the protection given by Indonesia government to the Rohingya refugees. This research uses normative empirical research. The data in this study were obtained through the research libraries to acquire secondary data by way of studying the legislation, books, the internet and other scholarly works related to the problems of the research. Furthermore, fieldwork conducted for obtaining primary data by interviewing respondents and informants. The results of the research showed that the non-refoulment principle gives no effect to Indonesia in giving assistance to the Rohingya refugees. Indonesia actions were done base on humanitarian value, Indonesia Constitution, and Pancasila value, instead of 1951 Convention on the Status of the Refugee. Accordingly with the result above, it is suggested to the government of Indonesia, to produce a new clear legislation on the management of the international refugee. And then, to assimilate and promote the 1951 Convention on the <b>Status</b> <b>of</b> <b>Refugee</b> as an international standard in assisting refugee to the Indonesian bodies that concern about it. Furthermore, to Indonesia government particularly Aceh suggested that to produce a new regulation in regard with the emergency respond and also to maintain all the refugee facilities that had been built by volunteers or others country.

30|$|Labour {{immigration}} {{is vital to}} many countries. Countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA are built on migration, on ‘good immigrants’. Refugees however are often perceived as ‘bad migrants”, as people who enter countries illegally, misuse social security and welfare provisions of these countries and threaten the well-being and even physical security of the law-abiding citizens of these countries. Often the public does not realise (or admit) that these people face prosecution, are displaced and depend on support from outside. It seems that the legal protection of refugees adds rigour to the attempt of countries to keep their borders tight and to prevent that such people even reach the territory of countries to seek the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>refugee.</b> If they do so then there usually is a long process waiting for asylum seeker, which often deprive them of basic rights.|$|E

We analyzed anthropometric measurements of 1047 refugee children ages 0 - 10 years old to assess their nutritional status at the overseas medical screening examination prior to resettlement in WA from July 2012 [...] June 2014. The prevalence estimates of the nutritional status categories were compared by country of origin. In addition, the nutritional <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> children age 0 - 5 years old were {{compared to that of}} low-income children in WA from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System. A total of 982 children were eligible for the study, with the majority (65 %) from Somalia, Iraq and Burma. Overall, nearly one-half of all refugee children had at least one form of malnutrition (44. 9 %). Refugee children ages 0 - 10 years were affected by wasting (17. 3 %), stunting (20. 1 %), overweight (7. 6 %) and obesity (5. 9 %). Among children 0 - 5 years old, refugee children had a significantly higher prevalence of wasting (14. 3 % versus 1. 9 %, p< 0. 001) and stunting (21. 3 % versus 5. 5 %, p< 0. 001), and a lower prevalence of obesity (6. 2 % versus 12. 9 %, p< 0. 001) than low-income children in WA. The dual burden of under- and over-nutrition among incoming refugee children as well as their overall difference in prevalence of nutritional status categories compared to low-income children in WA provides evidence for the importance of tailored interventions to address the nutritional needs of refugee children...|$|E

Aims: To identify global priorities for Cochrane systematic reviews of public health topics. Methods: Systematic reviews of public health interventions were identified and mapped against global health risks.
