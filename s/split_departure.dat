5000|$|The {{majority}} of the team sailed from Tilbury on 17 April 1936 on-board the SS Cathay with the Leeds and Warrington players together with Hunslet's Harry Beverley departing by train on 24 May to meet {{the rest of the}} team at Marseilles. The <b>split</b> <b>departure</b> was due to the players being involved in the Challenge Cup final on 18 April and in Beverley's case due to a family illness. The team arrived in Melbourne on 25 May and travelled to Sydney by train the following day.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} (i. e., reduced) quasi-birth-death {{representation of}} a FIFO queue with two separate traffic streams (and dedicated service processes) is combined with ETAQA truncation to yield scalable finite approximations of the two departure processes from this queue. Via matrix-analytic techniques, these models {{may be used to}} study various arrival/service interdependences between the two traffic streams, as important to ensure optimal QoS in networks composed of such systems with correlated processes. In this paper, we investigate how the first moments and the autocorrelation of one service process affect both output processes and, subsequently, the performance of downstream queues to which the <b>split</b> <b>departure</b> processes are directed. The approximate analytic results are validated by simulation...|$|E

50|$|Other major {{international}} routes are to Seoul (25 weekly departures operated by Korean Airlines, Asiana Airlines, Hawaiian, and Jin Air), Sydney (12 weekly departures operated by Hawaiian, Jetstar and Qantas) and Vancouver (19 weekly <b>departures</b> <b>split</b> between Air Canada and Westjet).|$|R
50|$|The party {{also had}} a number of splits over these years. One such <b>split</b> saw the <b>departure</b> of the faction of Bert Cochran and Clarke, who formed the American Socialist Union, which lasted until 1959. That 1953 {{opposition}} supported some of the positions of Michel Pablo, the Secretary of the Fourth International, although Pablo disagreed with their wish to dissolve the Fourth International.|$|R
5000|$|Moose Blood {{formed in}} 2012. The group's line-up {{consisted}} of Eddy Brewerton on vocals and guitar, Mark E. Osbourne on guitar, Kyle Todd on bass and Glen Harvey on drums. After honing their musical skills in hardcore bands Burn Down Rome and Harbours, the group aimed for more singing and melody in their music. In November 2013, the band released a <b>split</b> with <b>Departures</b> through independent label No Sleep. On 16 April 2014, {{it was announced}} that the band had signed to No Sleep and would release their debut album later in the year. No Sleep founder Chris Hansen became aware of Moose Blood due to Departures, [...] "and {{it was love at first}} listen".|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} {{overhauled}} in 1980. Escalators and lifts were established to the platforms, and the station concourse, which was originally <b>split</b> into arrival, <b>departure,</b> and freight sections, was redone completely. The station was overhauled again from 2004 to 2008. This overhaul replaced the roof, lowered platforms 3 to 6 to international standards and lengthened them. The towers and the {{bridge over the}} platforms, upon which the main station building is placed, were reconditioned.|$|R
5000|$|Domari {{was once}} thought to be the [...] "sister language" [...] of Romani, the two {{languages}} having <b>split</b> after the <b>departure</b> from the Indian subcontinent, but more recent research suggests that the differences between them are significant enough to treat them as two separate languages within the Central zone (Hindustani) group of languages. The Dom and the Rom are therefore likely to be descendants of two different migration waves out of India, separated by several centuries.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, when Brown {{signed with}} Polydor Records, he and Byrd formed the label People Records, and issued several records by other artists, {{including}} Byrd himself, who recorded the funk hit, [...] "I Know You Got Soul". Byrd appeared onstage with Brown from 1970 until leaving his band again in 1973 {{due to a}} combination of issues, including uncredited compositions on some Brown hits, Brown's issues with singer Vicki Anderson, whom Byrd eventually married and remained with until his death, and wanting to start a family with Anderson. Though he remained in contact with Brown following this final <b>split,</b> this <b>departure</b> ended Byrd's 21-year professional association with Brown, who now went by the nickname [...] "Godfather of Soul", after composing the soundtrack to the film, Black Caesar. Without Byrd's help, however, Brown began struggling with production of the music on People and soon began experiencing financial troubles; Brown's recording success started dwindling as Brown's other band mates left for better opportunities.|$|R
50|$|From 1986 until 1994, Knight was {{a member}} of the award-winning American boy band New Kids on the Block. They went on to sell over 80 million records {{worldwide}} before splitting in 1994 after he left during the tour for their 1994 album Face the Music. They originally tried to continue the tour claiming he had been badly hurt by a horse, but in a press conference a few weeks later, they revealed that they were actually <b>splitting.</b> His early <b>departure</b> led to reports that some members were frustrated with the way he did so and that those feelings prevented an earlier reformation of them.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{issue in a}} distributed supply network is how to allocate the stocks to competing downstream nodes so as to minimize the total inventory holding cost while satisfying the end-customer service level requirements. In this thesis, an alternative allocation policy, Longest-Queue- First-Served (LQFS), is proposed and studied in a two-stage distributed supply network. Such an allocation policy represents one type of management mode, centralized information control structure, of collecting and utilizing information in production-inventory systems. The distributed supply system studied in this thesis is an inventory-queue network with inventory control at all nodes. An inventory-queue is a queueing model that incorporates an inventory replenishment policy for the output store. Following the specific allocation policy, all jobs (material and information) flow from one node to another in such a supply network. First, we investigate characteristics of the <b>splitting</b> <b>departure</b> processes under the LQFS allocation policy. We also provide the explicit solutions of the distribution and squared coefficient of variation of the in-terdeparture times in M/G/ 1 inventory queues. Because {{of the complexity of}} system and the LQFS policy, the exact analysis and calculation of the performance are utmostly difficult. Therefore, a simple and effective approximated approach, the decomposition method, is developed to evaluate the performance of the supply network under the LQFS policy. Lastly, the optimization problem is solved by using frontier curve method to minimize the total inventory holding capital meeting the end-customer service level under the LQFS policy. The optimal procedure can be split into two steps: (1) constructing the frontier curve for the specific service level; (2) searching the optimal base stock level on the frontier curve. The sensitivity analysis of the optimization under both LQFS and FCFS policies is addressed. The analytic and numerical results illustrate that approximated splitting and composite SCVs of inter-departure times in inventory queues are close to the simulation results. By comparing the effects of two allocation policies, the LQFS and FCFS policies, it can be seen from our numerical results of the optimization that the LQFS allocation policy performs better than the FCFS policy when the service times at the center node are exponential and hyperexponential distribution. In other words, when the density function of service times at the center node is monotonicity, the LQFS policy can optimize the total holding cost under the same conditions as the FCFS policy. This important founding of our research provide guidelines for managers in practical application of the LQFS policy. With the rapid development of information management technology, the centralized information management mode increasingly becomes preferred choice. The LQFS allocation policy will be integrated in the supply network to increase efficiency and coordination. This thesis contributes to this important trend and we expect our research results to unearth practical applications in supply chain management and electronic commerce and to stimulate further research in this direction...|$|R
5000|$|Romani and Domari {{share some}} similarities: {{agglutination}} of postpositions {{of the second}} Layer (or case marking clitics) to the nominal stem, concord markers for the past tense, the neutralisation of gender marking in the plural, {{and the use of}} the oblique case as an accusative. This has prompted much discussion about the relationships between these two languages. Domari was once thought a [...] "sister language" [...] of Romani, the two languages having <b>split</b> after the <b>departure</b> from the Indian subcontinent but more recent research suggests that the differences between them are significant enough to treat them as two separate languages within the Central zone (Hindustani) group of languages.

5000|$|Parade were a British five piece girl group, {{who were}} {{formerly}} signed to Asylum Records. The band had five members: Emily Biggs (born 16 March 1990), Lauren Deegan (born 8 June 1989), Bianca Claxton (born 28 November 1989), Jessica Agombar (born 7 August 1990) and Sian Charlesworth (born 17 January 1987). On 11 February 2013 it was confirmed via the Parade Twitter account {{the group had}} <b>split</b> following the <b>departure</b> of Bianca Claxton. Agombar and Claxton have embarked on solo careers, with Agombar releasing tracks Bam Bam and Bam Bam Pt. 2. Claxton released her debut EP Hi-5 on May 17, 2015, and entered the selection for the UK Eurovision Song Content entry in 2016. Agombar is releasing her debut EP later this year; with Claxton releasing her debut album in the not too near future ...|$|R
5000|$|Although Bark Psychosis never {{formally}} <b>split</b> up, Simnett's <b>departure</b> effectively {{ended the}} band, as Sutton had by now {{lost interest in}} experimental rock and become a full-scale convert to drum and bass music. In a 2001 interview, Sutton recalled, [...] "By {{the end it was}} just me with Mark drumming and a nice pool of different people to draw upon. The last couple of tours we did in '94 I just loved. But by that point I knew I wanted to try something else." [...] Later in the summer, Sutton reunited with Daniel Gish to record some new tracks in an ambient and drum and bass style, which they performed at the 1994 Phoenix Festival at Stratford-upon-Avon). Although the duo's performance was billed under the Bark Psychosis name (and was technically the band's last appearance for ten years), it was in effect the debut of a brand new project which was only tenuously related to Bark Psychosis music.|$|R
5000|$|Moose Blood {{formed in}} August 2012 and self-released a demo, Bukowski Demo (Summer '12), {{in the same}} month. The group's line-up {{consisted}} of Eddy Brewerton on vocals and guitar, Mark E. Osbourne on guitar, Kyle Todd on bass and Glenn Harvey on drums. On 11 February 2013, an EP, Moving Home, was released through Fist in the Air. [...] "Boston" [...] and [...] "Orlando" [...] were released together as a single through Venn Records on 26 April. The band released a <b>split</b> EP with <b>Departures</b> through No Sleep on 12 November.

In May, the band supported I Am the Avalanche on their tour of the UK. Their debut album I'll Keep You in Mind, From Time to Time charted at number 45 on the US Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. They played on the 2015 Warped Tour.|$|R
40|$|Different {{schemes for}} large scale {{networks}} hosting distributed applications have been recently adopted for network path marking based on adaptive behavior of swarm-based agents. Topologically complex networks must use efficient routing methods {{in order to}} route data traffic from a source to a destination. In this paper the Split Agent-based Routing Technique (SART) is applied to a network in which {{a certain amount of}} data traffic is injected to mark different paths. Split Agent-based Routing Technique (SART) [20] is a variant of swarm-based routing [9, 22] where agents are <b>split</b> after their <b>departure</b> to the next node on a hop-by-hop basis at the same time performing path marking. Packets that are delay sensitive are marked as prioritized. Agents recognize these packets as being a part of, and try to influence the two way routing tables. Thorough examination has been done for the performance and path recoverability using SART algorithm for marking any requested path, taking into account a number of metrics. It is shown that the split agent scheme offers an efficient on demand path marking and path-capacity reservation in a decentralized manner (particularly efficient for large scale networks). SART method undoubtedly represents a solution for significant network optimization particularly for the equal share of network resources. Also it is shown that this scheme offers a way to increase overall performance. 1...|$|R
