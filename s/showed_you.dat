Advertisements played up {{the wreck of the}} $40,000 train car while a positive review in The Moving Picture World praised the well-managed production's prison and track wreck scenes, but remarked that the improbable story was purely fantastical. One of the more dramatic articles to appear in The Moving Picture World included reference to the film while playing up the dramatic element describe the footage and the filming of the wreck. It states: [...] "... The scenes were portrayals of a train crash and they give you startling before-and-after wreck views. They made you shiver when they <b>showed</b> <b>you</b> the fate that came to a car full of passengers - sudden, cruel and without warning. They made you shiver; ... And you thanked God that the thing before you was only a picture on the screen!" [...] Known advertisements for the film included theaters in Rhode Island and Indiana. Records show that film made it to Australia, with one Launceston, Tasmania newspaper showing an advertisement on January 30, 1911.|$|E
500|$|... "Dreams Old Men Dream" [...] was {{inspired}} by the Ingmar Bergman film Wild Strawberries and Fyodor Dostoyevskys short story The Dream of a Ridiculous Man. It tells the story of an elderly man reflecting back on the life he had and what he wished he had done before. [...] "On the Night My Love Broke Through" [...] was the last song made for the album that was recorded live. It {{was inspired}} by the works of German-American poet Charles Bukowski. [...] "Relief" [...] is written {{from the perspective of a}} person that questions God's way of controlling the Earth and handling its inhabitants. God himself answers the person's question when Willett sings, [...] "Flash flood, you got too comfortable, so I <b>showed</b> <b>you,</b> who's really in control." [...] The overall sound of the track is described as electronica in the vein of [...] "mid-era Radiohead." [...] The album closer, [...] "Cryptomnesia", {{was inspired by}} a case involving Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nabokov being accused of plagiarism involving his 1955 novel Lolita. Willett said that it is [...] "an apt word for the way history seeps into his songwriting today." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the season}} finale, Bell talked about Coulson losing his arm, saying that [...] "he paid a price—that was {{important}} to us. You don't mess with {{the forces of nature}} without getting bitten, {{and the fact that he}} literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and <b>showed</b> <b>you</b> that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words." [...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons—who had been one person—to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic".|$|E

Not merely, 'He hath <b>showed</b> <b>thee,</b> O deep philosopher, or {{brilliant}} genius;'--not merely, 'He hath <b>showed</b> <b>thee,</b> O eminent saint, or believer who hast {{been through}} many deep experiences:' but, 'He hath <b>showed</b> <b>thee,</b> O man.'

[...] ABC reporter Kate Snow adopted the same locution. On CNN's [...] "Out in the Open," [...] Rick Sanchez characterized the word without using it by saying, [...] "Last night, we <b>showed</b> <b>you</b> a clip {{of one of his}} supporters calling Hillary Clinton the b-word that rhymes with witch." [...] A local Fox 25 news reporter made the same move when he rhymed the unspoken word with rich.|$|E
2500|$|Her second album, Ahl Al Esheg {{produced}} the hit single [...] "Ahl Al Esheg" [...] in early 1997 and the moderate hit [...] "Bizal Minak" [...] in summer 1997. [...] "Ahl Al Esheg" [...] {{is considered one}} of Haddad's signature songs and is still performed in most of her concerts. [...] "Bizal Minak", while not as successful as [...] "Ahl Al Esheg", had a controversial music video which was shot in London. The song's chorus can be translated to [...] "I <b>showed</b> <b>you</b> the right way, but you're still walking in the wrong direction". Hence, the black and white music video, which was directed by Haddad's then-husband, shows padestrians in London walking backwards while Haddad is the only person walking in the correct direction. Haddad claimed that she memorized the lyrics of the song backwards {{in order to make the}} video works. The video also shows Prince Charles walking backwards in reference to his marriage problems. Ironically, Princess Diana died few months after the shooting of the video.|$|E
