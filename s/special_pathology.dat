40|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is introducing a method to distinguish between different landmarks of the retina: bifurcations and crossings. The methodology may help in differentiating between arteries and veins and is useful in identifying diseases and other <b>special</b> <b>pathologies,</b> too. The method does not need any special skills, thus it can be assimilated to an automatic way for pinpointing landmarks; moreover it gives good responses for very small vessels. A skeletonized representation, taken out from the segmented binary image (obtained through a preprocessing step), is used to identify pixels with three or more neighbors. Then, the junction points are classified into bifurcations or crossovers depending on their geometrical and topological properties such as width, direction and connectivity of the surrounding segments. The proposed approach is applied to the public-domain DRIVE and STARE datasets and compared with the state-of-the-art methods using proper validation parameters. The method was successful in identifying the majority of the landmarks; the average correctly identified bifurcations in both DRIVE and STARE datasets for the recall and precision values are: 95. 4 % and 87. 1 % respectively; also for the crossovers, the recall and precision values are: 87. 6 % and 90. 5 % respectively; thus outperforming other studies...|$|R

40|$|Hospitals have a {{specified}} set of antibiotics for restricted use (ARU), very expensive, which are only recommended for <b>special</b> <b>pathologies.</b> The pharmacy department daily checks the prescription {{of this kind}} of antibiotics since it is often the case that, after a careful analysis, one can get the same therapeutic effects by using normal antibiotics which are much cheaper and usually less aggressive. In this paper, we describe a multi-agent system to help in the revision of medical prescriptions containing antibiotics of restricted use. The proposed approach attaches an agent to each patient which is responsible of checking different medical aspects related to his/her prescribed therapy. A pharmacy agent is responsible for analyzing it and suggesting alternative antibiotic treatments. All these agents are integrated in a hospital distributed scenario composed by many different kinds of software and human agents. This patient-centered multi-agent scenario is specified using the design methodology of Electronic Institutions. © 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Research in {{the general}} and <b>special</b> fields of <b>pathology</b> during 1945 has been {{handicapped}} by World War II, with its great demand on manpower and the numerous pressing problems it put before the scientific minds of the nations at war.

40|$|This thesis has {{two main}} themes: {{on the one}} hand, in Chapters 3 and 5 we study some effects of the {{presence}} of timelike boundaries on linear classical and quantum field theories; the second theme is the analysis of technical issues with the paper B. S. Kay and R. M. Wald, Phys. Rep. 207, 49 - 136 (1991), which is carried out in parts of Chapter 2 and in Chapter 4. Chapter 2 contains a novel result on the characteristic initial value problem on globally hyperbolic spacetimes. In Chapter 3, we conjecture that (when the notion of a Hadamard state is suitably adapted to spacetimes with timelike boundaries) there is no isometry-invariant Hadamard state for the Klein-Gordon equation defined on the region of the Kruskal spacetime 'to the left of' a surface of constant Schwarzschild radius in the right Schwarzschild wedge, if Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed there. We also prove that, under a suitable notion for 'boost-invariant Hadamard state' which also takes into account the <b>special</b> infra-red <b>pathology</b> of massless fields in 1 + 1 dimensions, there is no such state for the massless 1 + 1 wave equation on the region of Minkowski space to the left of an eternally uniformly accelerating mirror – with Dirichlet boundary conditions at the mirror. Chapter 5 collects and extends results of Solis about the causal structure of spacetimes with timelike boundaries, and deals with algebraic aspects of the interplay between Green hyperbolicity and boundary conditions in classical field theory. It also outlines a plan for generalizing the established work on wave-like equations from globally hyperbolic spacetimes to 'globally hyperbolic spacetimes-with-timelike-boundaries'. Appendix B contains a non-existence result for boost-invariant Hadamard states of a massless scalar field in (1 + 1) -dimensional Minkowski spacetime...|$|R

40|$|Background: Inflammatory myopathies {{represent}} a <b>special</b> group of <b>pathology.</b> Establishing the correct diagnosis {{in the early}} phase and a better follow-up are the main objective for improving the life quality of these patients. Objective: The aim {{of this research was}} to assess the usefulness of sonoelastography in diagnosis of inflammatory myopathies. Material and Method: A prospective longitudinal study with a control group was carried out in the Radio-Imaging Department, Cluj-Napoca District University Hospital, Romania, from May 2007 to July 2010. Measurements: Image Processing 2. 8 software was used to analyze the elastographic images in correlation with clinical and biochemical data was used. Results: Analysis of Receiver Operating Characteristic curves statistics for elastography parameters showed significant values for the following parameters: average green color, average blue color, average intensity of color, dispersion of red, dispersion of green, and dispersion of hue. Conclusions: Our study highlighted the utility of some elastography parameters in the diagnosis of inflammatory myopathies; the parameter proved to be statistically different in case group compared to control.

40|$|Surgical {{histopathology}} is learnt principally by {{the practical}} experience of reporting routine cases. This study performed a quantitative {{audit of the}} types of specimens reported by trainees at a teaching hospital and a district general hospital. At the teaching hospital all cases are seen by trainees and it was predicted that the distribution of specimens among trainees would be entirely random. Significant variations were found in the number of skin, breast, cervix, prostate, and endometrial cases reported by each trainee. In some cases this related to a trainee having a special interest (skin and breast pathology) or areas requiring <b>special</b> techniques (breast <b>pathology).</b> At the district general hospital the workload was much higher so that juniors did not see all cases and junior trainees were not seeing bronchial, liver, or lymph node biopsy specimens. This type of audit shows that in teaching hospitals specialisation by some trainees (as encouraged by the new MRCPath exam) may be to the detriment of others and that in district general hospitals pressure of work may actually reduce a trainee's exposure to difficult cases. Without systematic audit this would not be recognised and remedied...|$|R

40|$|Parasites are a {{group of}} {{eukaryotic}} organisms that may be free-living or form a symbiotic or parasitic relationship with the hosts. Consisting of over 800, 000 recognized species, parasites may be unicellular (Protozoa) or multicellular (helminths and arthropods). The association of parasites with human population started long before the emergence of civilization. Parasitic zoonotic diseases are prevalent worldwide including India. Appropriate epidemiological data are lacking on existing zoonotic parasitic diseases, and newer diseases are emerging in our scenario. Systemic diseases such as cysticercosis, paragonimiasis, hydatidosis, and toxoplasmosis are fairly common. Acquired Toxoplasma infections are rising in immune-deficient individuals. Amongst the ocular parasitic diseases, various protozoas such as Cystoidea, trematodes, tissue flagellates, sporozoas etc. affect humans in general and eyes in particular, {{in different parts of}} the world. These zoonoses seem to be a real health related problem globally. Recent intensification of research throughout the world has led to specialization in biological fields, creating a conducive situation for researchers interested in this subject. The basics of parasitology lie in morphology, pathology, and with recent updates in molecular parasitology, the scope has extended further. The current review is to address the recent update in ophthalmic parasites with <b>special</b> reference to <b>pathology</b> and give a glimpse of further research in this field...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technological solution based on sensors controlled remotely {{in order to}} monitor, track and evaluate the gait quality in people with or without associated <b>pathology.</b> <b>Special</b> hardware simulating a shoe was developed, which consists of three pressure sensors, two bending sensors, an Arduino mini and a Bluetooth module. The obtained signals are digitally processed, calculating the standard deviation and establishing thresholds obtained empirically. A group of users was chosen {{with the aim of}} executing two modalities: natural walking and dragging the left foot. The gait was parameterized with the following variables: as far as pressure sensors are concerned, one pressure sensor under the first metatarsal (right sensor), another one under the fifth metatarsal (left) and a third one under the heel were placed. With respect to bending sensors, one bending sensor was placed for the ankle movement and another one for the foot sole. The obtained results show a rate accuracy oscillating between 85 % (right sensor) and 100 % (heel and bending sensors). Therefore, the developed prototype is able to differentiate between healthy gait and pathological gait, and it will be used as the base of a more complex and integral technological solution, which is being developed currently...|$|R
