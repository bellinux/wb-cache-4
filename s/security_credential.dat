Therefore the automatic adaptation and migration of software to newer environments remains as interesting research question. This paper presents the Otho Toolkit for synthesis of application-specific Grid service wrappers based on specifications of scientific legacy programs. The services are customised and tailor-made {{for a specific}} application, service hosting environment and computational infrastructure and include source code for optional manual refinement. We demonstrate its unique combination of advanced features like support for multiple service platforms, parameter sweeping, iterative and parallel programs, progress-reporting, filestaging and <b>security</b> <b>credential</b> management. Moreover our services reliably identify program termination-causes based on programmatically evaluated post-mortem program states.

Many proposals of Multipath routing has been proposed in ADHOC Networks but under constrained from keying environment most seems ignorant. In WSN where crucial data is reported by nodes in deployment area to their securely located Sink, route security has to be guaranteed. Under dynamic load and selective attacks, availability of multiple secure paths is a boon and increases the attacker efforts by many folds. We propose to build a subset of neighbors as our front towards destination node. We also identified forwarders for query by base station. The front is optimally calculated to maintain the <b>security</b> <b>credential</b> and avail multiple paths. According to our knowledge ours is first secure multipath routing protocol for WSN.

40|$|Protecting (authorizing) {{access to}} {{individual}} web services has been explored in many research efforts. The focus of such {{research is to}} ensure that authorized users with appropriate credentials are able to access resources under controlled and authorized security. However, integrating and/or composing such services, e. g. through workflow environments in collaborative environments, remains an open challenge. A key issue is to ensure the security requirements of each individual service and hence their service provider, whilst still allowing them to be used as part of a workflow execution - potentially by users with diverse security credentials. The aim of this research is to provide a security-oriented workflow framework that supports such secure workflow enactment. The framework supports a variety of security evaluation mechanisms using diverse <b>security</b> <b>credential</b> aggregation mechanisms leveraging centralized and decentralized security with push/pull of security information as required.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new Blockchain-based message and {{revocation}} accountability system called Blackchain. Combining a distributed ledger with existing mechanisms for security in V 2 X communication systems, we design a distributed event data recorder (EDR) that satisfies traditional accountability requirements {{by providing a}} compressed global state. Unlike previous approaches, our distributed ledger solution provides an accountable revocation mechanism without requiring trust in a single misbehavior authority, instead allowing a collaborative and transparent decision making process through Blackchain. This makes Blackchain an attractive alternative to existing solutions for revocation in a <b>Security</b> <b>Credential</b> Management System (SCMS), which suffer from the traditional disadvantages of PKIs, notably including centralized trust. Our proposal becomes scalable {{through the use of}} hierarchical consensus: individual vehicles dynamically create clusters, which then provide their consensus decisions as input for road-side units (RSUs), which in turn publish their results to misbehavior authorities. This authority, which is traditionally a single entity in the SCMS, responsible for the integrity of the entire V 2 X network, is now a set of authorities that transparently perform a revocation, whose result is then published in a global Blackchain state. This state can be used to prevent the issuance of certificates to previously malicious users, and also prevents the authority from misbehaving through the transparency implied by a global system state.

40|$|Single sign-on (SSO) is an {{emerging}} and more secure authentication mechanism that enables an authorized user {{with a single}} username/password to be authenticated by many service providers in a distributed network system. The existing technique used SSO scheme and it has achieved security by applying well-organized security parameters and its improved scheme introduced Verifiable Encryption of Signatures (RSA-VES). But the improvement of both the techniques with respect to security is not fully accomplished. We identified two attacks in existing SSO techniques. The first attack permits a malicious service provider to successfully communicate with a legal user more than one time and to recover the authenticated username/password and then to impersonate the service consumer to grant access to web resources and web services provided by other SP (Service Provider). Another attack is that a third party without any <b>security</b> <b>credential</b> {{may be able to}} access network services easily by impersonating some legal user or a fictional user. In our proposed work we introduced Improved Single sign-on (ISSO) scheme, which prevents Credential recovery attack, Impersonation attack and Data injection attack.

We implemented three web applications which provide financial solutions to customers. These three web applications used SOAP based request and response mapping for efficient handling of communication protocols.

40|$|An {{end-to-end}} shared {{secret key}} between two distant nodes in a mobile ad hoc network(MANET) {{is essential for}} providing secure communication between them. However, to provide effective security in a MANET, end-to-end key establishment should be secure against both internal as well as external malicious nodes. An external malicious node in a MANET does not possess any valid <b>security</b> <b>credential</b> related to the MANET, whereas an internal malicious node would possess some valid security credentials related to the MANET. Most of the protocols for end-to-end key establishment in MANETs either make an unrealistic assumption that an end-to-end secure channel exists between source and destination or use bandwidth consuming multi-path schemes. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient protocol for end-to-end key establishment during route discovery (E 2 -KDR) in MANETs. Unlike many other existing schemes, the protocol establishes end-to-end key using trust among the nodes which, during initial stage, is established using public key certificate issued by an off-line membership granting authority. However, {{the use of public}} key in the proposed protocol is minimal to make it efficient. Since the key is established during route discovery phase, it reduces the key establishment time. The proposed protocol exploits mobility to establish end-to-end key, and provides comprehensive solution by making use of symmetric keys for protecting routing control messages and end-to-end communication. Moreover, as the end-to-end keys are established during route discovery phase, the protocol is on-demand and only necessary keys are established, which makes the protocol storage scalable. The protocol is shown to be secure using security analysis, and its efficiency is confirmed by the results obtained from simulation experiments...|$|E
