40|$|Patients utilising {{forensic}} {{mental health}} inpatient services experience {{a range of}} <b>sexual</b> <b>risks,</b> including vulnerability to sexual exploitation and exposure to sexually transmissible infections. However, there is a paucity of research exploring the issue of <b>sexual</b> <b>risks</b> {{from the standpoint of}} patients and the nurses who work closely with them in inpatient secure settings. This article presents findings from a qualitative exploratory study, which investigated the views of patients and nurses about sexual relationships in forensic mental health settings. Risk was a major theme arising from the data and is the focus of this article. Subthemes from nurse participants included sexual safety, sexual vulnerability, unplanned pregnancies, and male sexuality issues. Subthemes from patients included <b>risks</b> associated with <b>sexual</b> activity, access to information and sexual health care, unplanned pregnancies, vulnerability, and male sexuality issues. Knowledge about these <b>sexual</b> <b>risks</b> by patients and nurses were well articulated, however information and assistance were considered by patients to be less than satisfactory in improving their knowledge or in providing the support they considered important to reduce <b>sexual</b> <b>risks.</b> The issue of risk needs to be addressed, and nurses would be well placed to contribute; however they require education to improve their ability to provide sexual health education to patients along with strategies to ensure patients receive the support and services they require to reduce their exposure to <b>sexual</b> <b>risks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Females {{have largely}} been {{neglected}} in the risk taking literature. Risk taking {{is thought to be}} a male trait, adapted to compete against other males (intrasexual competition) for access to mates. The following thesis proposes that women also have an incentive to compete intrasexually to attain a mate, and thus an incentive to take risks. However the types of risk women take will differ from that of men. Specifically, intrasexual competition will drive women to take <b>sexual</b> and appearance <b>risks,</b> and drive men to take financial, physical and <b>sexual</b> <b>risks.</b> Three hundred and seventy-two participants completed an online questionnaire which measured their individual levels of intrasexual competition using Buunk & Fisher’s (2009) Intrasexual Competition Scale, and measured their willingness to engage in a range of financial, physical, <b>sexual</b> and appearance <b>risks.</b> It was found that overall males were more willing to take physical and <b>sexual</b> <b>risks,</b> and women were more willing to take more financial and appearance risks. Furthermore it was found that people with higher levels of intrasexual competition were more willing to take physical, <b>sexual</b> and appearance <b>risks</b> than those with lower levels of intrasexual competition. However there was no association found between levels of intrasexual competition willingness to take financial risks. The following findings were made within each gender: Within men, those with higher levels of intrasexual competition were more willing to take physical and <b>sexual</b> <b>risks</b> than those with lower levels of intrasexual competition. Within women, those with higher levels of intrasexual competition were more willing to take physical, <b>sexual,</b> and appearance <b>risks</b> than those with lower levels of intrasexual competition.

In the Ditrame Plus PMTCT program in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, two cohorts of women (475 HIV-infected women and 400 HIV-negative women) were followed up two years after the pregnancy when they were offered prenatal HIV testing. In each cohort, we compared the proportion of women who communicated with their regular partner on <b>sexual</b> <b>risks,</b> prior to and after prenatal HIV testing. We analysed socio-demographic factors related to this communication. We measured two potential conjugal outcomes of women HIV testing: the level of condom use at sex resumption after delivery and the risk of union break-up. Prenatal HIV testing increased conjugal communication regarding <b>sexual</b> <b>risks,</b> whatever the woman's serostatus. This communication was less frequent for women in a polygamous union or not residing with their partner. Around 30 % of women systematically used condoms at sex resumption. Among HIV infected ones, conjugal talk on <b>sexual</b> <b>risks</b> was related to improved condom use. After HIV testing, more HIV-infected women separated from their partners than HIV-uninfected women, despite very few negative reactions from the notified partners. In conclusion, offering prenatal HIV counselling and testing is an efficient tool for sensitizing women and their partners to HIV prevention.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade soap operas shown on British {{television}} have been constantly facing severe criticism from the public, politicians and the press for allegedly containing ‘too much sex’; and {{in the context of}} rising teenage pregnancies and the spread of STDs and HIV in the UK, concerns over the role of television’s sexual content in general, and that of soap operas’ in particular, in potentially influencing young people’s perception, attitudes and behviours are most accentuated. The overall objective {{of this study is to}} comprehensively identify and analyse, using the method of content analysis, the amount, frequency, type, nature and contexts of sexual activity portrayed across a four-week sample of British and Australian soap operas shown on the UK‘s five main terrestrial channels: the sample analysed include the three most popular British soap operas, Coronation Street (ITV), EastEnders (BBC One), and Emmerdale (ITV), the UK‘s soap operas most popular with teenagers, Hollyoaks (Channel 4) and its late night spin-off Hollyoaks in the City (Channel 4), and the two day-time Australian soap operas, Neighbours (BBC One) and Home and Away (Channel Five). The study also provides a comprehensive quantitative analysis of, first, some of the important thematic aspects and contextual elements of soap operas‘ portrayal of sex and sexuality, such as themes of sexual intercourse and other behaviours, accompanying behaviours and outcomes of sexual activity, and, second, the attributes and general profiles of all characters involved in sexual activity. Furthermore, the study aims to identify whether or not soap operas contain safe-sex messages and any references to <b>sexual</b> <b>Risks</b> and Responsibilities (R & R) and provide a detailed analysis of soap operas‘ treatment of the various aspects of safe-sex and <b>sexual</b> <b>risks</b> and responsibilities. The main findings in this current research clearly indicate that day-time and prime-time soap operas: (a) contain relatively moderate amounts of sexual portrayals, compared with post-watershed serialised drama programmes and general TV programming, (b) rarely portray overt and explicit intimate sexual behaviours, (c) rely primarily on narrative devices in their portrayal of sex and sexuality, (d) place primary and substantial emphasis on sexual activity, and (e) dedicate substantial numbers of portrayals and storylines to highlight <b>sexual</b> <b>risks</b> and responsibilities and disseminate safe-sex messages. For instance, in some soap operas, Coronation Streets and EastEnders, around four out of every ten scenes with sexual content revolved around <b>sexual</b> <b>Risks</b> and Responsibilities...|$|R

One hundred undergraduate women listened to a description of each situation, viewed clips of a male actor making increasingly coercive verbal requests, and provided a videotaped, verbal response to each request given by the actor in each situation. Participants then completed measures assessing sexual victimization history, psychopathology, and sexual attitudes. Experts in the sexual violence research area and undergraduate men rated the effectiveness of participants’ responses to the series of <b>sexual</b> victimization <b>risk</b> vignettes in decreasing risk for having an unwanted sexual experience. Participants’ responses to the nonsexual social situation vignettes were rated by these same groups for their effectiveness at increasing the likelihood that the woman would succeed in achieving the social goal described in the vignette. Using the same instructions, participants also rated the effectiveness of their responses prior to and after viewing their responses. Results revealed that experts rated undergraduate women’s responses to the <b>sexual</b> victimization <b>risk</b> vignettes as more effective than responses to the nonsexual social situation vignettes. Additionally, participants’ responses were rated as more effective across both types of situations as the level of verbal coercion increased {{on the part of the}} male actor.

40|$|Abstract First paper “Audiovisual <b>Sexual</b> <b>Risks</b> and the Internet: social {{representations}} within European Parliamentary debates” The European Commission’s {{policy on}} children protection toward audiovisual sexual contents {{available on the}} Internet {{is based on a}} multi-stakeholders approach to regulatory, self-regulatory and co-regulatory initiatives. Several public meetings are held at the European Institutions. Aim: Our research focuses on the ones taken at the European Parliament between 2001 and 2016 and concerning the implementation of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (2010 / 13 /EU), the Directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography (2011 / 92 /EU) and the Better Internet for Kids program (COM 2012 196 final). Methods: The corpus was composed of 45 European parliamentary debates. Methodologies for data analysis were content analysis (AtlasTi), and Alceste method (Iramuteq). Results: First, anchoring and objectification are identified through images and metaphors of the Internet and online audiovisual <b>risks,</b> especially <b>sexual</b> ones. Second, 4 clusters were identified: 1. European issue; 2. Sexual exploitation and child-pornography; 3. Risks; 4. Positive use of the Internet. Third, relevant themes, such as international dimension of crime, and rapidity of technological change. Abstract Second paper “International statistics on audiovisual <b>sexual</b> <b>risks</b> within European parliamentary debates: hegemonic and emancipated representations of the problem description ” European parliamentary debates on the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (2010 / 13 /EU), the Directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography (2011 / 92 /EU) and the Better Internet for Kids program (COM 2012 196 final) make often reference to statistics provided by European institutions and associated agencies. These organizations {{play a role in the}} construction of knowledge and interpretation of socio-political phenomena. Aims: The research wishes to observe how international statistics create a hegemonic representation of audiovisual <b>sexual</b> <b>risks</b> for children, emancipated through reference to national data (Moscovici, 1961 / 76). Methods: The corpus is composed of 45 debates, held at the European Parliament between 2001 and 2016. A content analysis is carried on through the AltasTi software (Bauer, Gaskell, 2007; Dany, 2016). Results: A hegemonic representation is transmitted within European institutions through data produced by Eurobarometer, EuKidsOnline, Europol, Interpol, United Nations, NGOs. Policy concerning the most violent crimes, such as child pornography and sexual exploitation, tend to be tackled through reference to a higher variety of data sources and statistics, aimed at filling a gap of scientific knowledge. Emancipated representations are raised through reference to national dataAbstract Third paper “Children protection and freedom of expression towards online audiovisual contents in a European perspective: polemical representation based on different cultural backgrounds” Internet policy towards online audiovisual risks for children, especially pornography, has been determined by the defense of freedom of expression, enshrined by the first amendment of the American Constitution (Castell, 2001). Nevertheless, European media systems have been influenced by a variety of historical and cultural backgrounds, paying attention towards ethical concerns related to risky audiovisual contents (Frau-Meigs, 2011). Aims: the piece of research aims to retrieve ethical considerations within the social representations of audiovisual <b>sexual</b> <b>risks.</b> The hypothesis is that polemical representations of audiovisual <b>sexual</b> <b>risks</b> are related to ethical concerns, by making reference to different ideological and cultural groups in Europe (van Dijk, 1998). Methods: By analyzing the European parliamentary debates on Internet policy concerning children protection, the research first retrieves references to ethical considerations within the speeches, then analyzes them through the Alceste method (Iramuteq), and finally carries on a content analysis (AtlasTi). Results: Debates on audiovisual media services directive focus on finding a balance between public service and market-oriented media system. Amongst audiovisual risks, child pornography evokes more ethical reflections. The principle of freedom of expression is either opposed to the possibility of media censorship or to the need of children protection. Polemical representations are due to different historical and cultural backgrounds, regulatory and policy frameworks...|$|R
