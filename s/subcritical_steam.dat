40|$|Two new {{concepts}} {{have been identified}} for direct steam generating solar fields that charge a two-tank molten salt storage system. The use of both supercritical and superheated <b>subcritical</b> <b>steam</b> is proposed, and discussed in practical terms and with regards to thermodynamic issues of heat transfer to the salt. Both concepts are found to allow significantly higher hot-tank temperatures than solar systems restricted by temperature limitations in thermal oil, with achievable temperatures comparable to solar tower systems that directly heat salt. This a distinct advantage for minimising the amount of salt required for a given amount of energy storage. Analysis of steam cycle efficiency using these results as a basis once again compared the supercritical and subcritical cases. For the power cycle, it was shown that there are advantages in using a supercritical power block when discharging from molten salt storage, because of the improved matching of the salt and steam cooling curves. Two examples were developed, {{and an increase in}} thermal conversion efficiency from 42. 4 % to 43. 8 % was found comparing the subcritical to the supercritical steam cases, were a suitable turbine available. Overall, energy transport and storage concepts are presented that maximise the advantages of high temperature that are achievable from high-concentration solar collectors such as solar dishes, in particular, minimisation of molten salt quantities in storage, and maximisation of thermal cycle efficiencies...|$|E

Abstract Thermal energy storage (TES) is a critical component in a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant since it is able to provide dispatchability and increase the capacity factor of the plant. Recently the Brayton power cycle using supercritical carbon dioxide (s-CO 2) has attracted considerable attention as it allows a higher thermal to electric power conversion efficiency compared to the conventional Rankine cycle using <b>subcritical</b> <b>steam.</b> However, no commercial TES has yet been developed for integration with a s-CO 2 based plant. One reason is the lack of a suitable storage material. This work explores the use of a eutectic NaCl-Na 2 CO 3 salt as a reliable high temperature phase change material (PCM). The PCM has been thermally cycled up to 1000 times. Its thermo-physical properties have been measured before and after it has been subjected to the thermal cycling and its corrosion behavior has been investigated. This eutectic salt shows good thermal stability without degradation after cycling 1000 times between 600 and 650 °C. The corrosion rate on stainless steel 316 (SS 316) increases linearly up to 350 cycles, and thereafter it stabilizes at 70 mg/cm 2...|$|E

Under an EPRI contract which was awarded to Sulzer in 1983, a full scale three-stage test pump was built which has been extensively tested for rotordynamic behavior. Design conditions selected for this pump are typical for fossil plants with <b>subcritical</b> <b>steam</b> generation. The pump was installed in a closed loop. To investigate rotordynamic behavior experimentally, the pump had to be equipped with sophisticated instrumentation including shaft vibration measurements within the pump. The influence of different parameters such as labyrinth clearances, amount of unbalance, swirl brakes, and flowrate is described. Experimental results (i. e., unbalance response) are compared with analytical results using a rotordynamic code based on finite element approach. In boiler feed pump systems, for a number of reasons, sudden loss of suction pressure can occur. In such cases, vaporization in the pump occurs accompanied by two phase flow conditions, large hydraulic forces, loss of damping, high rotor amplitudes, with possible contact between rotor and stator. This condition was simulated with the test loop. The influence of such a loss of suction incident on pump behavior, especially shaft vibrations, is described. The conclusions highlight the importance of the labyrinths on rotordynamic behavior, in particular the influence of swirl brakes to reduce shaft vibration amplitudes. If the analytical results have to compare well with measured vibrations, excellent quantitative knowledge of bearing, labyrinth and impeller interaction dynamic coefficients is essential...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to demonstrate the use of <b>subcritical</b> <b>steam</b> to pretreat coal for slurry liquefaction, allowing liquefaction to be carried out at lower severity and improving product yield and quality. Samples of Illinois No. 6 coal were pretreated in 750 psia steam at 340 {degree}C for 15 minutes. These samples, as well as raw coal, were liquefied at high (400 {degree}C, 30 min.) and low (385 {degree}C, 15 min.) severity conditions under 1500 psia hydrogen with tetralin as the donor solvent. Improved yields were obtained at both conditions. (Improved yields were not obtained at a liquefaction temperature of 350 {degree}C as that put the sample into the region of retrogressive reactions). The deleterious effects of slow heating and exposure of the sample to air were demonstrated. Under low severity conditions, steam pretreatment more that doubled the oil yield, increasing it from 12. 5 to 29 wt %. Tests were also conducted with aromatic ethers as model compounds. These were exposed to inert gas and steam at pretreatment conditions and in some cases to liquid water at 315 {degree}C. {alpha}-Benzylnaphthyl ether and {alpha}- naphthylmethyl phenyl ether show little difference in conversion and product distribution when the thermolysis atmosphere is changed from inert gas to steam. However when these compounds were reacted in the presence of 5 {angstrom} zeolite, the yields of the thermolysis products improved. Zeolite proved effective in suppressing isomerization of the starting materials. These results suggested that zeolites might be beneficial in steam pretreatment of coal and in coal liquefaction.

40|$|A {{technical}} feasibility assessment was performed for retrofitting oxy-fuel technology to an existing power plant burning low sulfur PRB fuel and high sulfur bituminous fuel. The {{focus of this}} study was on the boiler/power generation island of a <b>subcritical</b> <b>steam</b> cycle power plant. The power plant performance in air and oxy-firing modes was estimated and modifications required for oxy-firing capabilities were identified. A 460 MWe (gross) reference subcritical PC power plant was modeled. The reference air-fired plant has a boiler efficiency (PRB/Bituminous) of 86. 7 %/ 89. 3 % and a plant net efficiency of 35. 8 / 36. 7 %. Net efficiency for oxy-fuel firing including ASU/CPU duty is 25. 6 %/ 26. 6 % (PRB/Bituminous). The oxy-fuel flue gas recirculation flow to the boiler is 68 %/ 72 % (PRB/bituminous) of the flue gas (average O{sub 2 } in feed gas is 27. 4 %/ 26. 4 %v (PRB/bituminous)). Maximum increase in tube wall temperature is less than 10 ÂºF for oxy-fuel firing. For oxy-fuel firing, ammonia injected to the SCR was shut-off and the FGD is applied to remove SOx from the recycled primary gas stream and a portion of the SOx from the secondary stream for the high sulfur bituminous coal. Based on CFD simulations it was determined that at the furnace outlet compared to air-firing, SO{sub 3 }/SO{sub 2 } mole ratio is about the same, NOx ppmv level is about the same for PRB-firing and 2. 5 times for bituminous-firing due to shutting off the OFA, and CO mole fraction is approximately double. A conceptual level cost estimate was performed for the incremental equipment and installation cost of the oxyfuel retrofit in the boiler island and steam system. The cost of the retrofit is estimated to be approximately 81 M$ for PRB low sulfur fuel and 84 M$ for bituminous high sulfur fuel...|$|E
40|$|Sandia National Laboratories and Siemens Energy, Inc., {{examined}} 14 different subcritical and supercritical steam cycles {{to determine}} if it is feasible to configure a molten-salt supercritical steam plant that has a capacity {{in the range of}} 150 to 200 MWe. The effects of main steam pressure and temperature, final feedwater temperature, and hot salt and cold salt return temperatures were determined on gross and half-net efficiencies. The main steam pressures ranged from 120 bar-a (subcritical) to 260 bar-a (supercritical). Hot salt temperatures of 566 and 600 %C 2 %B 0 C were evaluated, which resulted in main steam temperatures of 553 and 580 %C 2 %B 0 C, respectively. Also, the effects of final feedwater temperature (between 260 and 320 %C 2 %B 0 C) were evaluated, which impacted the cold salt return temperature. The annual energy production and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) were calculated using the System Advisory Model on 165 MWe subcritical plants (baseline and advanced) and the most promising supercritical plants. It was concluded that the supercritical steam plants produced more annual energy than the baseline <b>subcritical</b> <b>steam</b> plant for the same-size heliostat field, receiver, and thermal storage system. Two supercritical steam plants had the highest annual performance and had nearly the same LCOE. Both operated at 230 bar-a main steam pressure. One was designed for a hot salt temperature of 600 %C 2 %B 0 C and the other 565 %C 2 %B 0 C. The LCOEs for these plants were about 10 % lower than the baseline subcritical plant operating at 120 bar-a main steam pressure and a hot salt temperature of 565 %C 2 %B 0 C.

The simplest solution for heat recovery is represented by adopting a pressurized fuel cell with the eventual expansion of the exhaust stream in a gas turbine. Other alternatives feature the adoption of various closed cycle recovery systems: a standard steam cycle, an inter-refrigerated helium cycle, and an advanced binary cycle. Assuming a fuel energy input of 100 MW, the overall efficiency of a hybrid cell was computed, which was much higher than that of a small capacity (100 kW) existing plant (67 versus ∼ 53 per cent). Such high efficiency hybrid SOFC systems were taken as the reference {{to evaluate the}} performance of alternate options. Reclaiming the cell waste heat by means of a <b>subcritical</b> <b>steam</b> cycle yields a performance similar to that of a hybrid system. Similar results are obtained resorting to a closed helium cycle. Advanced binary cycles, using either potassium or cesium as working fluids, were extensively investigated in view of achieving a superior overall performance. The hot, clean stream exhausted by the fuel cell is recognized as an ideal heat source for a binary plant. The SOFC-binary cycle system was fully optimized yielding top efficiencies ∼ 74 per cent and an additional power output of ∼ 45 per cent of the cell rating (30 per cent {{in the case of the}} hybrid system). The excellent efficiency of a binary cycle combined with the large amount of oxygen that is available in the cell exhaust flow suggests that a supplementary firing of the fuel could improve the overall merit of the system. Burning 75 per cent of the additional natural gas, for example, reduces the total efficiency to a level of that of a hybrid system but makes available an extra power 1. 35 times greater than the fuel cell capacity. Pushing further this concept, the fuel cell could become an auxiliary equipment of a binary cycle...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{temperature}} level {{increase of}} molten salt solar tower plants is one important task {{on the development}} schedule to increase the system's overall efficiency. In the conventional power plant technology, modern supercritical steam power plants work with life steam temperatures near 620 °C. To apply these modern power blocks in molten salt solar tower plants, salt temperatures near 650 °C are required. Today's molten salt tower plants reach salt temperatures of 565 °C. To follow the positive development tendencies of fossil power plants, in the present work the combination of supercritical steam power plants with solar towers is analyzed. As stated in recent literature (Kolb, Kelly, Singer), {{the state of the}} art tubular central receiver concept coupled with increased steam parameters of the power block (300 bar/ 600 °C/ 610 °C) shows a marginal potential to decrease LEC. The identification of future concept innovations with significant cost reduction potential in the field of molten salt tower plants, the enhancement of the receiver efficiency as well as the assessment of critical aspects related to their feasibility is the task of this paper. Therefore this work first focuses on {{the state of the art}} molten salt tower technology and related improved concepts with molten salt. The selected improvements follow on the one hand the aim to increase the receiver's maximum temperature level to approximately 650 °C to be able to feed modern supercritical power blocks, on the other hand the aim to require a low development effort. After the reference concept is characterized, the objective is the systematic comparison of receiver technologies, which show a potential of improved thermal efficiencies. The assessed receiver candidates are tubular and direct absorption receivers, either external or located in a cavity. The analyzed power level is 125 MWel, while the steam process parameters are varied from low temperature level (550 °C) and <b>subcritical</b> <b>steam</b> to high temperature level (620 °C) and supercritical steam. With this, selected molten salt power plants were specified and then modeled with different sizes of solar fields and different storage capacities and analyzed on an annual basis. The results show, that the assessed concept options close to the state of the art require drastically decreased investment costs to end up with significant LEC reduction and cost-competitiveness. The increase in overall efficiency of these improved concepts is compensated by their higher financial effort. Results of further concept assessments as well as the sensitivity analysis of parameters and costs are described...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} aimed at obtaining process {{engineering}} and scale-up data at a laboratory scale to investigate the technical and economic feasibility of a patented post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) capture process?the Integrated Vacuum Carbonate Absorption Process (IVCAP). Unique features of the IVCAP include its ability to be fully-integrated with the power plant?s steam cycle and potential for combined sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2 }) removal and CO{sub 2 } capture. Theoretical and experimental studies of this project were aimed at answering three major technical questions: 1) What additives can effectively reduce the water vapor saturation pressure and energy requirement for water vaporization in the vacuum stripper of the IVCAP? 2) What catalysts can promote CO{sub 2 } absorption into the potassium carbonate (PC) solution to achieve an overall absorption rate comparable to monoethanolamine (MEA) and are the catalysts stable at the IVCAP conditions and in the flue gas environment? 3) Are any process modifications needed to combine SO{sub 2 } and CO{sub 2 } removal in the IVCAP? Lab-scale experiments and thermodynamic and process simulation studies performed to obtain detailed information pertinent to the above three technical questions produced the following results: 1) Two additives were identified that lower the saturation pressure of water vapor over the PC solution by about 20 %. 2) The carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzyme was identified as the most effective catalyst for promoting CO{sub 2 } absorption. The absorption rate into the CO{sub 2 }-lean PC solution promoted with 300 mg/L CA was several times slower than the corresponding 5 M MEA solution, but absorption into the CO{sub 2 }-rich PC solution was comparable to the CO{sub 2 }-rich MEA solution. The tested CA enzymes demonstrated excellent resistance to major flue gas impurities. A technical-grade CA enzyme was stable at 40 {degrees}C (104 {degrees}F) over a six-month test period, while its half-life was about two months at 50 {degrees}C (122 {degrees}F). Enzyme immobilization improved the CA enzyme?s thermal stability by up to three times compared to its free counterpart. 3) Two process modifications were proposed to improve the technical performance of the IVCAP for combined SO{sub 2 } removal and CO{sub 2 } capture. The results from a techno-economic study of a 528 MWe (gross) pulverized coal-fired, <b>subcritical</b> <b>steam</b> power plant revealed {{that the cost of}} CO{sub 2 } avoidance with the IVCAP was about 30 % lower than conventional MEA-based processes. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of the IVCAP ranged from $ 40 to 46 /MWh, an increase of 60 to 70 % compared to a reference power plant without CO{sub 2 } capture. The overall conclusion {{of this study is that}} the IVCAP is a technically feasible and economically more attractive process than available MEA-based processes. A scale-up study using the slipstream of an actual coal-derived flue gas and development of a more stable CA enzyme are recommended for future studies...|$|E
