5|$|The {{two sides}} met and {{fought in the}} {{vicinity}} of the Lochty Burn, near where Carnoustie town centre now lies. The fighting is said to have been <b>so</b> <b>fierce</b> that the Lochty burn ran red with the blood of the fallen.|$|E
5|$|Competition for the {{contract}} was <b>so</b> <b>fierce</b> that it involved last-minute discounts, offers of free parts and allegations of sabotage. Metro-Cammell, Kawasaki and ASEA were shortlisted for the final round. Metro-Cammell based its design on the Hong Kong MTR M-Train EMU and proposed to use the GEC propulsion system had they won {{the contract}}. Metro-Cammell also delivered a concept mock-up and was originally the favourite to win the contract. However, analysts became concerned that a measuring error involving the London Underground 1983 Stock during the evaluation period could jeopardise their bid.|$|E
5|$|Formed in late 1853, the Conciliation cabinet {{faced the}} Parliament {{only when it}} {{gathered}} in May 1854. Paraná presented a bill to reform the Code of Criminal Procedure, which had already been reformed in 1841. In search of support, Paraná {{went as far as}} to aid Liberal candidates in the 1854 provincial elections. The opposition by most saquaremas to this judicial reform was <b>so</b> <b>fierce</b> that a year later, Paraná (who had been raised from Viscount to Marquis in late 1854) backed down and implicitly withdrew the bill.|$|E

5|$|The Germans did not {{mount an}} all-out {{infantry}} {{assault on the}} divisional area, which was under continuous mortar and artillery attack. Instead, each sector was subjected to small scale assaults at times supported by tanks or self-propelled guns. Enemy troops first attacked the Independent Company, then the Borders who were forced off the high ground overlooking the river, and finally the KOSB. The Germans mounted a strong assault following the landing of the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade south of the river beside Driel. This attack forced the KOSB out of their positions, which were only regained after a bayonet charge. Fighting was <b>so</b> <b>fierce</b> that first reports suggested the KOSB had been annihilated, although {{it turned out that}} the counter-attack had in fact reduced the battalion's strength to only 150 men.|$|E
25|$|The 25th Marines' 3rd Battalion {{had landed}} {{approximately}} 900 {{men in the}} morning. Japanese resistance at the Quarry was <b>so</b> <b>fierce</b> that by nightfall only 150 were left in fighting condition, an astounding 83.3% casualty rate.|$|E
25|$|The rivalry grew <b>so</b> <b>fierce</b> {{that when}} the New York Rangers reached the 1950 Stanley Cup Finals to face the Red Wings, but could not play in their home rink, Madison Square Garden, because the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus were using the arena, New York {{arranged}} to play home games in Toronto, whose fans held a deep enmity against the Red Wings.|$|E

25|$|Although the NHL had {{to compete}} hard with the WHA to sign these amateur players, {{they managed to}} sign all 16 of their first-round draft picks before the rival league could. The NHL-WHA {{competition}} was <b>so</b> <b>fierce</b> that the Toronto Maple Leafs offered a staggering, at the time, five-year $600,000 contract for right winger Lanny McDonald of the Medicine Hat Tigers, which kept the No. 4 pick from signing with the WHA's Cleveland Crusaders.|$|E
25|$|On 19 September 2011, an AH-1W crashed during {{training}} exercises at Camp Pendleton, California, killing the two Marine crewmembers on board. An {{investigation into the}} crash determined that it was caused by bird strike. The aircraft collided with a red-tailed hawk, the impact damaging the pitch change link which in turn produced vibrations to the rotors <b>so</b> <b>fierce</b> that they caused the transmission and rotors to break off from the helicopter body.|$|E
25|$|In prison, Bunker {{continued}} to write. He finally {{had his first}} novel No Beast <b>So</b> <b>Fierce</b> published in 1973, to which Dustin Hoffman purchased the film rights. Bunker was paroled in 1975, having spent eighteen {{years of his life}} in various institutions. While he was still tempted by crime, he now found himself earning a living from writing and acting. He felt that his criminal career had been forced by circumstances; now that those circumstances had changed, he could stop being a criminal.|$|E

25|$|Ulu Grosbard {{took on the}} {{directing}} job of {{the film}} Straight Time, after its original director, actor Dustin Hoffman, dropped out to focus on starring in the lead role. The film, {{based on the novel}} No Beast <b>So</b> <b>Fierce</b> by Edward Bunker, is about a thief who is released from prison and tries to live a straight life. Boam was asked to rewrite the script, and he quit his job at Fox to work with Grosbard. He received writing credit for the film, along with Bunker and Alvin Sargent.|$|E
25|$|While the Toronto-Montreal rivalry {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous in sport, the rivalry with the Red Wings is no less intense. This rivalry dates to the 1920s. As of 2017, they have had twenty-three playoff meetings, five in the finals. <b>So</b> <b>fierce</b> was the rivalry that when the New York Rangers reached the finals against Detroit in 1950, but could not play in their home rink, Madison Square Garden, because the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus were in town, they {{arranged}} to play home games in Toronto, whose fans hated the Wings.|$|E
25|$|He {{published}} his second novel, Animal Factory to favorable reviews in 1977. A 1978 movie called Straight Time based on No Beast <b>So</b> <b>Fierce</b> {{was not a}} commercial success, but Bunker participated in the drafting of the screenplay, and also got his first acting part in the movie. Like most of Bunker's parts, it was a fleeting cameo, but Bunker eventually appeared in numerous movies, such as The Running Man, Tango & Cash and Reservoir Dogs (as Mr. Blue), {{as well as the}} film version of Animal Factory, for which he also wrote the screenplay.|$|E

He made a notable exception when he took part in a concert of chamber music in the White House on November 13, 1961, at the invitation of President John F. Kennedy, whom he admired. On December 6, 1963, Casals was awarded the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom.|$|E
25|$|West of Lake Rudolf, the 25th East African Brigade (Brig. W. Owen) {{marched on}} Namaraputh with the {{objective}} of taking the town of Kalam (Map 1: Point 4). Opposition from Merille tribesman in the area was <b>so</b> <b>fierce,</b> that the Brigade was compelled to cease its advance and to go over to the defensive. Any advance west of the lake would first require wide area operations to subdue these irregular forces. By the time Moyale fell, allied forces had captured Mogadishu to the east and this success encouraged General Wavell to advise Cunningham that the South African division should be readied to deploy to Egypt at short notice. Cunningham thus replaced 2nd and 5th Brigades with the 21st East African Brigade and withdrew them back into Kenya.|$|E
25|$|Albertone's move {{opened a}} wide {{gap in the}} Italian lines, and {{isolated}} his brigade from Arimondi and Dabormida. By 5:30 a.m., at sunrise, while the two Italian brigades deployed on the Rebbi Arienni, from his position overlooking the Mariam Shavitu valley Albertone sighted the Ethiopian camp. Convincing himself that Baratieri wanted him to threaten those positions, he sent forward the 1st Native Battalion of major Turitto to scout the ground. Around 6 p.m. the advanced battalion came under heavy attacks from nearby Ethiopian troops, and Menelik was rapidly binging fresh forces to this side. The assault was <b>so</b> <b>fierce</b> that it reached the Italian second line, and the entire Native Brigade was forced to retreat, protected by the fire of Albertone's two mountain artillery batteries. At 6:45 Baratieri, who {{heard the sound of}} the fighting, ordered Dabormida to advance in support of Albertone, whom he assumed to be at the false Kidane Meret, or little ahead. Once Dabormida discovered the Native Brigade was further away, he continued to slowly march westwards, reaching the Mariam Shavitu valley 3 miles north of Albertone's positions.|$|E

500|$|The Red Army {{offensive}} {{began at}} 6:30a.m. on 12 May 1942, {{led by a}} concentrated hour-long artillery bombardment and a final twenty-minute air attack upon German positions. The ground offensive began with a dual pincer movement from the Volchansk and Barvenkovo salients at 7:30a.m. The German defences were knocked out by air raids, artillery-fire and coordinated ground attacks against German fortifications. The fighting was <b>so</b> <b>fierce</b> that the Soviets inched forward their second echelon formations, preparing to throw them into combat as well. Fighting was particularly ferocious near the Soviet village of Nepokrytaia, where the Germans launched three local counter-attacks. By dark the deepest Soviet advance was [...] Moskalenko, commander of the 38th Army, discovered the movement of several German reserve units and realised that the attack had been opposed by two German divisions, not the one expected, indicating poor Soviet reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering before the battle. A captured diary of a dead German general alluded to the Germans knowing about Soviet plans in the region.|$|E
500|$|Arnold led the American chase, {{and then}} led Poor's men {{in an attack}} on the Balcarres redoubt. [...] Balcarres had set up his {{defenses}} well, and the redoubt was held, in action <b>so</b> <b>fierce</b> that Burgoyne afterwards wrote, [...] "A more determined perseverance than they showed … is not in any officer's experience". [...] Seeing that the advance was checked, and that Learned was preparing to attack the Breymann redoubt, Arnold moved toward that action, recklessly riding between the lines and remarkably emerging unhurt. [...] He led the charge of Learned's men through the gap between the redoubts, which exposed the rear of Breymann's position, where Morgan's men had circled around from the far side. [...] In furious battle, the redoubt was taken and Breymann was killed. [...] Arnold's horse was hit in one of the final volleys, and Arnold's leg was broken by both shot and the falling horse. [...] Major Armstrong finally caught up with Arnold to officially order him back to headquarters; he was carried back in a litter.|$|E
500|$|Costa's first {{recording}} {{as leader}} was in 1956, with his trio featuring bassist Vinnie Burke and drummer Nick Stabulas. This was released under slightly differing titles by Josie Records and Jubilee Records, and was well received: critic John S. Wilson, for instance, {{commented on the}} [...] "roaring, spitting piano solos by Eddie Costa". Around this time, Costa was nicknamed [...] "The Bear" [...] by Burke for his powerful playing. Also in 1956, Costa and Burke joined guitarist Tal Farlow, forming a resident trio {{to play at the}} Composer, a club on West 58th Street in New York. Farlow's comment on the absence of a drummer from the trio was that [...] "Eddie's feeding, comping {{or whatever you want to}} call it was <b>so</b> <b>fierce</b> that there was no doubt at all where the time was, so I didn't miss the drums at all". The trio stayed together, recording several albums under Farlow's name, until, in 1958, the Composer closed. Costa was often in recording studios as a sideman around this time: he appeared on approximately 20 albums in both 1956 and 1957. These included small group settings with Herbie Mann, Oscar Pettiford, and Phil Woods, and accompanying vocalists such as Tony Bennett and Chris Connor.|$|E
