40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) reanalysis of ocean climate variability. In the assimilation, a model forecast produced by an ocean general circulation model {{with an average}} resolution of 0. 25 ° 0. 4 ° 40 levels is continuously corrected by contemporaneous observations with corrections estimated every 10 days. The basic reanalysis, SODA 1. 4. 2, spans the 44 -yr period from 1958 to 2001, which complements the span of the 40 -yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis (ERA- 40). The observation set for this experiment includes the historical archive of hydrographic profiles supplemented by <b>ship</b> <b>intake</b> measurements, moored hydrographic obser-vations, and remotely sensed SST. A parallel run, SODA 1. 4. 0, is forced with identical surface boundary conditions, but without data assimilation. The new reanalysis represents a significant improvement over a previously published version of the SODA algorithm. In particular, eddy kinetic energy and sea level variability are much larger than in previous versions and are more similar to estimates from independent observations. One issue addressed in this paper is {{the relative importance of}} the model forecast versus the observations for the analysis. The results show that at near-annual frequencies the forecast model has a strong influence, whereas at decadal frequencies the observations become increasingly dominant in the analysis. As a consequence, interannual variability in SODA 1. 4. 2 closely resembles interannual variability in SODA 1. 4. 0. However, decadal anomalies of the 0 – 700 -m heat content from SODA 1. 4. 2 more closely resemble heat content anomalies based on observations. 1...|$|R
50|$|Unprofitable deals, such as steam yacht Neva {{built in}} Turku in 1904 and four {{submarine}} hulls built in Okhta {{and handed over}} in 1905 caused massive losses to W:m Crichton & C:o. The failed combustion engines caused delays and warranty costs. Moreover, operations had relied on prepayments of new orders and therefore decline of order intake in 1906 led quickly to cash shortage. <b>Ship</b> order <b>intake</b> dropped drastically in 1906 leading to dismissal of hundreds of employees at the Turku yard. By spring 1907 the company was in a serious crisis. In addition to cash shortage the company's machinery and facilities were in poor shape and old fashioned, causing low productivity. The facilities required immediate investments, for which the company had no funds.|$|R

They decrease the aesthetic value of natural lagoons, encrust the hulls of <b>ships,</b> clog the <b>intakes</b> of power plants, pose a hazard to people engaging in water recreation, and block mechanical structures such as locks. They are important biofouling organisms, forming heavy crusts on any suitable surface. Unclogging of pipes and cleaning of boats and harbor structures is costly.|$|R

40|$|We examine to {{what degree}} {{we can expect to}} obtain {{accurate}} temperature trends for the last two decades near the surface and in the lower troposphere. We compare temperatures obtained from surface observations and radiosondes as well as satellite-based measurements from the Microwave Soundings Units (MSU), which have been adjusted for orbital decay and non-linear instrument-body effects, and reanalyses from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA) and the National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). In regions with abundant conventional data coverage, where the MSU has no major influence on the reanalysis, temperature anomalies obtained from microwave sounders, radiosondes and from both reanalyses agree reasonably. Where coverage is insufficient, in particular over the tropical oceans, large differences are found between the MSU and either reanalysis. These differences apparently relate to changes in the satellite data availability and to differing satellite retrieval methodologies, to which both reanalyses are quite sensitive over the oceans. For NCEP, this results from the use of raw radiances directly incorporated into the analysis, which make the reanalysis sensitive to changes in the underlying algorithms, e. g. those introduced in August 1992. For ERA, the bias-correction of the one-dimensional variational analysis may introduce an error when the satellite relative to which the correction is calculated is biased itself or when radiances change on a time scale longer than a couple of months, e. g. due to orbit decay. ERA inhomogeneities are apparent in April 1985, October/November 1986 and April 1989. These dates can be identified with the replacements of satellites. It is possible that a negative bias in the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) used in the reanalyses may have been introduced over the period of the satellite record. This could have resulted from a {{decrease in the number of}} ship measurements, a concomitant increase in the importance of satellite-derived SSTs, and a likely cold bias in the latter. Alternately, a warm bias in SSTs could have been caused by an increase in the percentage of buoy measurements (relative to deeper <b>ship</b> <b>intake</b> measurements) in the tropical Pacific. No indications for uncorrected inhomogeneities of land surface temperatures could be found. Near-surface temperatures have biases in the boundary layer in both reanalyses, presumably due to the incorrect treatment of snow cover. The increase of near-surface compared to lower tropospheric temperatures in the last two decades may be due to a combination of several factors, including high-latitude near-surface winter warming due to an enhanced NAO and upper-tropospheric cooling due to stratospheric ozone decrease...|$|R
2500|$|Homogenization is {{necessary}} for all climate data to correct for non-climatic changes, such as introduction of different measurement instruments, changes in location of the instruments, or differences {{in the time of}} day that measurements are taken. The NOAA temperature dataset is regularly updated with refinements improving the allowance for known biases, including the effects of past changes in methods of collecting temperatures. In 2015 it changed from the Global Historical Climatology Network to the new International Surface Temperature Initiative databank which includes many more stations giving wider coverage of land surface temperatures, and the latest Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature dataset (version 4) which made improved allowances for biases, including the phased changeover from measuring <b>ship</b> water <b>intake</b> to using automatic buoys: the previous version made a simpler allowance for this. An article published in the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Science journal in June 2015 by a team led by Thomas R. Karl, director of the NOAA datacenter, reported that these adjustments made very little difference to the temperature record, but the small change in recent years was sufficient to indicate that there had been no hiatus in the period from 1998 to 2014. They used the IPCC definition of the supposed hiatus as a slowdown in rate of temperature increase from 1998 to 2012, compared to the rate from 1951 to 2012, and again found no support for the idea of a [...] "hiatus" [...] or slowdown.|$|R
40|$|Environmental context Dimethylsulfide, a {{trace gas}} {{produced}} by oceanic plankton, {{is a key}} chemical species in the global cycles of sulfur and aerosols, with implications that span marine ecology to climate regulation. Knowledge of what governs dimethylsulfide production in the surface ocean depends on our ability to measure concentration changes over time and depth. We describe a sampling and analytical system that provides continuous shipboard measurements of dimethylsulfide concentrations in high-resolution vertical profiles. Abstract A sampling and analytical system has been developed for shipboard measurements of high-resolution vertical profiles of the marine trace gas dimethylsulfide (DMS). The system consists of a tube attached to a conductivity-temperature- depth (CTD) probe with a peristaltic pump on deck that delivers seawater to a membrane equilibrator and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometer (Eq-APCIMS). This allows profiling of DMS concentrations {{to a depth of}} 50 m, with a depth resolution of 1. 3 - 2 m and a detection limit of nearly 0. 1 nmolL- 1. The seawater is also plumbed to allow parallel operation of additional continuous instruments, and simultaneous collection of discrete samples for complementary analyses. A valve alternates delivery of seawater from the vertical profiler and the <b>ship's</b> underway <b>intake,</b> thereby providing high-resolution measurements in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions. Tests conducted on various cruises in the Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans show good agreement between the Eq-APCIMS measurements and purge and trap gas chromatography with flame photometric detection (GC-FPD) and demonstrate that the delivery of seawater from the underway pump did not significantly affect endogenous DMS concentrations. Combining the continuous flow DMS analysis with high-frequency hydrographic, optical, biological and meteorological measurements will greatly improve the spatial-temporal resolution of seagoing measurements and improve our understanding of DMS cycling. © CSIRO 2014...|$|R
40|$|The oxygen (O 2) {{concentration}} in the surface ocean is influenced by biological and physical processes. With concurrent measurements of argon (Ar), which has similar solubility properties as oxygen, we can remove the physical contribution to O 2 supersaturation and determine the biological oxygen supersaturation. Biological O 2 supersaturation in the surface ocean reflects the net metabolic balance between photosynthesis and respiration, i. e., the net community productivity (NCP). We present a new method for continuous shipboard measurements of O 2 /Ar by equilibrator inlet mass spectrometry (EIMS). From these measurements and an appropriate gas exchange parametrization, NCP can be estimated at high spatial and temporal resolution. In the EIMS configuration, seawater from the <b>ship's</b> continuous <b>intake</b> flows through a cartridge enclosing a gas-permeable microporous membrane contactor. Gases in the headspace of the cartridge equilibrate with dissolved gases in the flowing seawater. A fused-silica capillary continuously samples headspace gases, and the O 2 /Ar ratio is measured by mass spectrometry. The ion current measurements on the mass spectrometer reflect the partial pressures of dissolved gases in the water flowing through the equilibrator. Calibration of the O 2 /Ar ion current ratio (32 / 40) is performed automatically every 2 hby sampling ambient air through a second capillary. A conceptual model demonstrates that the ratio of gases reaching the mass spectrometer is dependent on several parameters, such as the differences in molecular diffusivities and solubilities of the gases. Laboratory experiments and field observations performed by EIMS are discussed. We also present preliminary evidence that other gas measurements, such as N 2 /Ar and pCO 2 measurements, may potentially be performed with EIMS. Finally, we compare {{the characteristics of the}} EIMS with the previously described membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) approach...|$|R

Prevalence data for SO intake and its co-occurrence with tobacco smoking and alcohol risk drinking considering age are presented. Methods Random general population sample of individuals aged 20 – 79 drawn from a mixed rural and urban area in Germany (Study of Health in Pomerania, <b>SHIP).</b> All medicament <b>intake</b> during the past 7 days prior to the interview was assessed according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification as part of an interview conducted in a health examination center. Results Among men, 3. 0 %, and among women 5. 0 % took SO. The proportion of SO users was higher (odds ratio 1. 9; 95 % confidence interval 1. 1 – 3. 4) whereas the proportions of current cigarette smokers and alcohol risk drinkers without SO use were lower among individuals aged 60 – 79 compared to those aged 20 – 39. The proportion of individuals with smoking, alcohol risk drinking or SO use was also lower among those aged 60 – 79 compared to the 20 – 39 year olds. Conclusion Although proportions of SO users in older adult age are higher than in younger adult age there are less subjects with any of the 3 substance use behaviors at older adult age compared to age 20 – 39. </p...|$|R
