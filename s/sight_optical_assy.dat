40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>sight</b> {{is a new}} {{metaphor for}} {{selecting}} distant objects or precisely pointing at close objects in virtual environments. <b>Optical</b> <b>sight</b> combines ray-casting, hand based camera control, and variable zoom into one virtual instrument {{that can be easily}} implemented for a variety of Virtual, Mixed, and Augmented Reality systems.

50|$|The M68 is parallax-free {{at around}} 50 yards, {{meaning that the}} red dot will not change {{position}} based on eye position at that range.

50|$|In <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> {{parallax}} {{refers to}} the apparent movement of the reticle {{in relationship to the}} target when the user moves his/her head laterally behind the sight (up/down or left/right), i.e. it is an error where the reticle does not stay aligned with the <b>sight's</b> own <b>optical</b> axis.|$|R

50|$|Shooters aim {{firearms}} {{at their}} targets with hand-eye co-ordination, using either iron <b>sights</b> or <b>optical</b> <b>sights.</b> The accurate range of pistols generally does not exceed 110 yd, while most rifles are accurate to 500 m using iron sights, or to longer ranges using <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> (firearm rounds may be dangerous or lethal well beyond their accurate range; the minimum distance for safety {{is much greater}} than specified range). Purpose-built sniper rifles and anti-materiel rifles are accurate to ranges of more than 2000 m.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{different}} day <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> available for the M200 Intervention. The standard <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> is the Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 variable magnification telescopic sight with a 56 mm objective. The alternative <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> is the US Optics SN-9. The night vision system is the AN/PVS-14 GEN III Pinnacle monocular, which attaches to the day optic using the Monoloc device. An AN/PEQ-2 infrared laser provides additional lighting in low-light conditions. The device {{is attached to a}} titanium strut.|$|R
5000|$|Reflector sights have {{unlimited}} eye relief, {{meaning that}} the user may place his eye at any distance from the sight and the reticle will remain visible. This allows flexibility in mounting and shooting position. The CompM4 uses Aimpoint's [...] "parallax-free" [...] optical correction system, meaning there is minimal induced optical error that would shift the point of aim relative to the <b>sight's</b> <b>optical</b> axis as the user's eye moves off-center {{in relation to the}} sight. The sight itself is parallax-free at around 50 yards, {{meaning that the}} red dot will not change position relative to the target based on eye position at that range. As in other reflex sights, the point of aim will change position based on eye position at other ranges with the maximum error being equal to the diameter of the <b>sight's</b> <b>optical</b> window at short range. There are currently two variants available; the standard CompM4 and the CompM4S, the latter being the same in terms of features and functionality, but having the battery compartment & power control knob mounted {{near the bottom of the}} sight instead of near the top.|$|R
25|$|The {{ergonomic}} {{design of the}} controls such as handles, launcher, barrel shape and <b>optical</b> <b>sight,</b> is predefined standard. All controls are easy to handle in all shooting positions (lying, kneeling or standing). After the weapon is fired, the firing mechanism with the attached <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> is removed and the barrel thrown away, the firing mechanism is reusable. The effective combat range of Panzerfaust 3 is between 15 and 300 metres against moving and 400 and 600 metres against static targets. An <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> with line pattern fixed to the reusable firing mechanism enables to engage moving or static targets. To ensure night combat capability, a night-vision device or residual light amplifier {{can be set up}} in front of the <b>optical</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 2014 the Irish Army began issuing {{upgraded}} Steyr AUG bullpup {{assault rifles}} to its operational units. The modularity of the AUG allowed the Irish AUG A1 model rifles to be modernized without any gunsmithing, by replacing the original A1 housing/receiver group (with 1.5× <b>optical</b> <b>sight)</b> with an A3 housing/receiver group (with MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail {{on top and}} right side) allowing a modern <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> to be fitted. The Trijicon ACOG 4× sight {{was selected as the}} new <b>optical</b> <b>sight.</b> The upgraded rifles are called the Steyr AUG Mod 14.|$|R

40|$|Line of <b>sight</b> <b>optical</b> links {{can provide}} {{extremely}} high bandwidth communications between terminals, {{but in order}} to maintain alignment between transmitter and receiver, tracking is required. In this letter, we report results from a "solid-state" tracking transmitter and receiver. The transmitter consists of a custom complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit that is flip-chip bonded to a seven-element resonant cavity light-emitting diode. The receiver uses a custom seven-element InGaAs detector array that is flip-chip bonded to a CMOS integrated circuit.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{optimised}} Lambertian order (OLO) of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for an indoor non-directed line of <b>sight</b> <b>optical</b> wireless communication (NLOS-OWC) systems. We firstly derive {{an expression of}} the OLO from a conventional Lambertian LED model, Then, we analyse the indoor multi-cell NLOS-OWC channel characteristics including optical power distribution and multipath time dispersion for two cases of one-cell and four-cell configurations. Furthermore, we estimate the transmission bandwidth by simulating the channel frequency response. Numerical results show that, by using OLO a significant improvement of the transmission bandwidth can be achieved for in indoor NLOS-OWC systems, in particular, for multi-cell configurations...|$|R

5000|$|Sights {{may also}} use a more {{sophisticated}} optical system that compensates for off axis spherical aberration, an error that can cause the dot position to diverge off the <b>sight's</b> <b>optical</b> axis with change in eye position. The optics used {{is a type of}} mangin mirror system, consisting of a meniscus lens corrector element combined with the semi-reflective mirror, sometimes referred to in advertising as a [...] "two lens" [...] or [...] "double lens" [...] system. Although these are referred to as [...] "parallax free" [...] sights, the system only keeps the aiming dot in alignment with the sight itself and does not compensate the inherent parallax errors induced by a collimated sight.|$|R

5000|$|The C7A1 (Diemaco C7FT) {{replaces the}} iron sight/carrying handle {{used on the}} C7 with a {{modified}} Weaver rail for mounting optics. Canadian development of rails preceded U.S. standardization of the MIL-STD-1913 [...] "Picatinny rail", so the [...] "Canadian Rail" [...] or [...] "Diemaco Rail" [...] differs slightly. There are 14 slots instead of 13, and each slot is narrower. The height of the rail is also higher, allowing the use of normal-height front sight post whereas a Picatinny rail {{requires the use of}} a higher F-marked front sight post. During development, the original rails were vacuum-bonded {{to the top of a}} bare receiver. For production, the rail and receiver were made out of a single forging. The mount can use traditional iron sights or the ELCAN C79 <b>Optical</b> <b>Sight</b> 3.4× power <b>optical</b> <b>sight,</b> both of which can be adjusted for individual eye relief. The <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> was designed for the C9 light machine gun and includes horizontal and vertical mil-bars used for range determination and deflection, and a tritium glow-in-the-dark aiming post rather than the traditional crosshairs. The 3.4× is powerful enough to properly see targets at the maximum accurate range of 400 m, though like most magnified <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> it is prone to criticism for creating tunnel vision in close quarters situations. While the wide aperture helps to speed target acquisition, Canadian soldiers generally forgo the C79 sight in favour of non-magnified <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> or backup iron sights when engaged or training in close quarters battle. The front sight was changed from the square post to a round post 0.05 in in diameter.|$|R
5|$|The British Army's basic {{infantry}} {{weapon is}} the L85A2 assault rifle, sometimes {{equipped with an}} L17A2 under-barrel grenade launcher or other attachments with the Picatinny rail. The rifle has several variants, including the L86A2, the Light Support Weapon (LSW) and the L22A2 carbine (issued to tank crews). These weapons are usually equipped with iron <b>sights</b> or an <b>optical</b> SUSAT, although <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> have been purchased to supplement these.|$|R
