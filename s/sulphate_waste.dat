40|$|Salicylic acid is {{nowadays}} {{produced by}} the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction. Using this method, sodium salicylate is converted into salicylic acid {{by the addition of}} sulphuric acid. Electrodialysis is proposed for this production process and avoids the use of sulphuric acid and the production of an acidic sodium <b>sulphate</b> <b>waste</b> stream. The low solubility of salicylic acid in water can be overcome by using mixtures of water and a primary alcohol. However, preliminary results have indicated that bipolar membranes of large dimensions cannot be used in direct contact with these solvent mixtures. In this paper, a three compartment configuration is proposed, which resolves this problem by enclosing the solvent mixture with two cationexchange membranes. An optimization of this configuration was performed by systematically varying different operating parameters. As the co-solvent, the use of methanol, ethanol and 1 -propanol was tested. The results indicate that a high salicylate concentration, a low co-solvent concentration of 1 - propanol and a low base concentration are the most optimal settings. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographic references. High {{sulphate}} wastewaters, {{originating from}} industrial activity {{or from the}} biological oxidation of sulphide ores (acid mine drainage), cannot be discharged into the environment untreated. Apart from the high sulphate levels, these waters may be very acidic and have high dissolved heavy metal concentrations. One promising treatment technology is biological sulphate reduction in anaerobic reactors. During anaerobic treatment, sulphate is reduced to sulphide and alkalinity is generated, raising the pH and precipitating many of the heavy metals. The process requires a carbon source as an electron donor. This may be simple organics such as ethanol or volatile fatty acids, which are directly utilized by the sulphate reducing bacteria, or complex organics such as sewage sludge which must first undergo solubilization and fermentation by a different microbial group. As an aid to the design and operation of this treatment process, a mathematical model describing an anaerobic digester treating high <b>sulphate</b> <b>waste</b> waters has been developed. Apart from sulphate reduction, the model includes those reactions which occur either prior to sulphate reduction, or in competition with it. These include hydrolysis of solid substrates, acidogenesis, beta oxidation of long chain fatty acids, acetogenesis and methanogenesis. By incorporating terms for these reactions, the model is able to simulate sulphate reduction using {{a wide range of}} carbon sources. A comprehensive literature survey of the kinetic parameters for the above reactions was undertaken. Apart from the Monod equation describing substrate uptake the kinetic expressions used in the model also includes terms for: unionized fatty acid inhibition; unionized or total sulphide inhibition; hydrogen inhibition and hydrogen product regulation where appropriate; pH inhibition; and dual substrate uptake where appropriate. Acid/base equilibrium chemistry has been included in order to predict the pH and unionized component concentrations (needed for calculating inhibition). The weak acids, H₂CO₃, H₂S, a number of SCFAs, NH₃, and their ions, as well as the strongly dissociating sulphates Na₂SO₄ and H₂SO₄ are included. An activity based model was used, with the activity coefficients calculated using Debye-Hilckle theory. The mass transfer rates of hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide from the liquid to the vapour phase are also included. A final aspect of the model is the equations describing the reactor geometry. A number of different reactors may be simulated, including a dynamic batch, steady state CSTR and dynamic CSTR. By separating the hydraulic and solids residence times, high rate reactors such as UASB and packed bed reactors may also be simulated. The model has been used to successfully predict the dynamic and steady state behaviour of a number of different reactor types, utilizing both simple and complex carbon sources...|$|E
40|$|The {{observation}} of mine waste contamination from abandoned mines has increased {{during the last}} ten years using hyperspectral airborne data. Acid mine drainage is the natural result by water leaching of sulphide-bearing rocks and pyrite mine and ore processing plants. Oxidation of sulphides produces iron-bearing sulphate and other metals as secondary minerals. The solubility of secondary sulphates is selective according to water pH. Therefore, the presence of certain <b>sulphate</b> on <b>waste</b> surfaces or river sediment tailings traces the pH of the water at the time of precipitation. Mapping mineral mixtures at various stages of oxidation and dehydration on the pyrite mud in Aznalcóllar short after the spill in 1998 using hyperspectral airborne data has been achieved. The mineralogy of the outer crust of the pyrite mud in the mine dam 116 days after the spill, indicates a intermediate dehydrated stage. 1...|$|R
30|$|Several {{bioremediation}} processes including decontamination of acid mine drainage and <b>sulphate</b> rich <b>waste</b> waters using sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) {{have been}} practiced {{much in the}} last decade (Johnson and Hallberg 2005; Neculita et al. 2007; Martins et al. 2009; Hussain and Qazi 2012). SRB collectively make a group of obligatory anaerobes exhibiting diverse morphological as well as physiological characteristics and occupy a wide range of habitats among terrestrial, sub-terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (Willis et al. 1997). They may be autotrophic or heterotrophic with assimilatory or dissimilatory types of metabolisms. Both dissimilatory autotrophs and heterotrophs use sulphate (SO 4 2 −) as terminal electron acceptor. The former metabolize CO 2 and the latter utilize multifarious energy-rich organic compounds as carbon sources/electron donors while generating sulfide (Pfennig et al. 1981; Lens and Kuennen 2001; Rabus et al. 2006; Martins et al. 2009). In various bioremediation processes based on the use of dissimilatory SRB, this biogenic sulfide reacts vigorously with dissolved metals present in the wastewaters forming insoluble precipitates of metal sulfides thus reducing the concentrations of metals and sulphates simultaneously (Costa and Duarte 2005; Vega-Lo´pez et al. 2007; Martins et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|The coal {{industry}} of Mpumalanga Province {{is faced with}} the problem of developing cost effective ways of using large volumes of calcium and magnesium <b>sulphate</b> enriched <b>waste</b> waters. Use of the waste waters for agricultural production may contribute as a stabilising factor with regard to yields in this high potential agricultural area. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of such waste waters on yield and to compare crop response to calcium and magnesium sulphate salinity at different nutrient levels. Two separate glasshouse experiments were conducted. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. SST 825) was grown in calcium and magnesium sulphate salinised nutrient solutions (Ca:Mg 2 : 1) with differential levels of NO 3, NH 4, P and K. A soil pot experiment was subsequently conducted with maize (Zea mays, cv. PAN 6256), three gypsum and magnesium sulphate salinity levels and a 6 x 2 x 3 factorial combination of N, P and K. Calcium and magnesium sulphate salinity decreased the biomass production of both crops. This was mainly due to interactions of Mg with the uptake of essential nutrients in wheat and a Mg toxicity andlor Ca deficiency induced by high levels of Mg andlor SO 4 in maize. The application of NO 3, NH 4, and K at rates different from the level considered beneficial for non-saline conditions improved wheat growth under sulphate saline conditions. Strongly inhibitory salinity levels controlled the maize yield of the highest salinity treatment regardless of the level of fertiliser application. A beneficial effect of higher NH 4 supply was observed in both experiments. This can be ascribed to the antagonistic effect that NH 4 exerted on Mg concentrations in plants (both experiments) and SO 4 (soil pot experiment) and/or to a higher N-utilization efficiency where N was supplied as NH 4 compared to NO 3. Differential application levels of P had no effect on the yield of wheat. Phosphorus concentrations in maize were marginal to low, even at extremely high soil Bray I-P levels. This was probably caused by the precipitation of P as insoluble calcium phosphate complexes in the soil andlor between the free space of the cortex cells of plant roots. These results could also indicate that the Bray I extraction method does not give a true reflection of plant available P in sulphate saline soil. Further experimentation is needed to verify these results under field conditions and determine the optimal rate, method and timing of especially NH 4 and PO 4 fertilisers when irrigating crops with these calcium and magnesium <b>sulphate</b> enriched <b>waste</b> waters.

30|$|The wide spread use of {{chromium}} {{in various}} products and application in different industrial processes has emitted considerable environmental contamination (Sultan and Hasnain 2007). Tanning industries widely used chromium compounds to convert animal skins and hides into leather, mainly chromium <b>sulphate.</b> Tanneries produced <b>waste</b> water in range of 30 – 35  L/kg with total Chromium 23.3 – 42.5  mg/L. Other than tanning industry, metal finishing, petroleum refining, {{iron and steel}} production, inorganic chemicals production, textile manufacturing, and pulp-producing industries also contributed in chromium pollution. Cr (chromium) waste is liberated into the environment via deprived storage, leakage or improper treatment and disposal practices. In India, more than 50 % of the total chromium effluent discharge originates from the leather, iron and steel industries (Garg et al. 2012, 2015). Human when exposed to Cr(VI) (hexavalent chromium) they may suffer from several health hazards such as allergic dermatitis, nasal irritation, renal tubular necrosis, eardrum perforation ulceration, skin irritation, lung carcinoma, epidermal dermatitis and increase risk of cytotoxic and genotoxic effects (cell death, cell transformation and gene mutation) and respiratory tract cancer (Camargo et al. 2005). Accumulation of Cr takes place mainly in spleen, liver, kidneys, and bone marrow. At high levels Cr damage cell membranes, disrupt cellular function, modify enzyme specificity, and damage structure of DNA (Farag and Zaki 2010; Smrithi and Usha 2012). It has adverse impacts on aquatic species as it penetrates into cell walls, accumulates in fish tissues. The pollution potential of the effluents from the tannery industry produces phytotoxic effects and high accumulation of heavy metals resulting in stress for plants. Trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) is 10 – 100 times less toxic than hexavalent chromium, {{the reason is that}} trivalent chromium complexes are impermeable through cellular membranes (Lu and Yang 1995).|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the process of {{bacterial}} sulphate reduction, which is used to removal of heavy metals and <b>sulphate</b> ions from <b>waste</b> waters. The life of animals and plants depends on the existence of microscopic organisms  microorganisms (MO), which {{play an important role in}} cycle changes of biogenic elements on the earth. The sulphur cycle in the nature is considered as one of the oldest and most significant biological systems (Fig. 1). The sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) miss the assimilatory part of the cycle and produce sulphides. The microbial population of this dissimilatory part is called sulfuretum. The SRB can be found in anaerobic mud and sediments of freshwater, thermal or non-thermal sulphur springs, mining waters from sulphide deposits, oil deposits, sea and ocean beds, and in the gastrointestinal tract of man and animals. The SRB represent a group of chemoorganotrophic, strictly anaerobic and gramnegative bacteria, which exhibit a great morphological and physiological diversity. Despite of their considerable morphological variety, they have one property in common, which is the ability to utilise preferentially sulphates (occasionally sulphites, thiosulphates, tetrathionates) as electron acceptors, which are reduced to sulphides, during anaerobic respiration. The electron donors in these processes are simple organic compounds as lactate, malate, etc.,(heterotrophically reduction) or gaseous hydrogen (autotrophically reduction). SRB can produce a considerable amount of hydrogen sulphide, which reacts easily in aqueous solution with the cations of heavy metals, forming metal sulphides that have low solubility. The bacterial sulphate reduction can be used for the treatment of acid mine drainage waters, which is considered to be the major problem associated with mining activities. In order to remove heavy metals from waste waters, e. g., from galvanizing plants, mine waters (Smolnik, obov locality) and metallurgic plants (works Krompachy) by use of the activity of SRB, mixed strains were isolated, cultivated, and their production of hydrogen sulphide was assessed. The cultures were then tested for the ability to precipitate copper and sulphates from a model solution. The bacteria were isolated from water samples from two localities: Východoslovenské eleziarne (works)  VS and spring Gajdovka  Gj. Isolation, cultivation and eliminating Cu 2 + and SO 42 - was carried out under following conditions: statically, temperature 30 oC, pH 7, 5, nutrient medium by J. Postgate (medium B, C and D) and anaerobic conditions. Residual copper in the solution was measured by atomic absorption photometry. The concentracion of sulphates in the solution was measured by the nefelometric method. Our findings from the isolation of SRB from two Slovak water samples and testing the cultures for their ability to remove copper permit the following conclusions: SRB occur in sufficient numbers in sulphur mineral water from natural sources and in industrial waste waters reservoirs, the sulphate-reducing activity can be harnessed for the purification of some industrial waste waters. The nature possesses a great biological potential that can be exploited under certain conditions in the cleanup of environmental pollution resulting from the industrial activity in the past and present...|$|R
