5|$|Analysis of {{algorithms}} is {{a branch}} of computer science that studies the performance of algorithms (computer programs <b>solving</b> <b>a</b> certain problem). Logarithms are valuable for describing algorithms that divide a problem into smaller ones, and join the solutions of the subproblems.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} variations of binary search. In particular, fractional cascading speeds up binary {{searches for the}} same value in multiple arrays, efficiently <b>solving</b> <b>a</b> series of search problems in computational geometry and numerous other fields. Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. The binary search tree and B-tree data structures are based on binary search.|$|E
5|$|In the {{unstable}} period during {{and following the}} 1889 coup in Brazil, which deposed Emperor Dom PedroII, and the 1893–94 navy revolt, the Brazilian Navy found itself unable to care for its own ships, let alone acquire new vessels. Meanwhile, Chile had agreed to a naval-limiting pact in 1902 with Brazil's principal rival, Argentina, as part of <b>solving</b> <b>a</b> larger boundary dispute, but they both retained the vessels built in the interim, {{many of which were}} significantly more modern and powerful than Brazil's ships. The Brazilian Navy was left behind its Argentine and Chilean counterparts in quantity as well—by the turn of the 20th century, Chile's total naval tonnage was , Argentina's , and Brazil's —even though Brazil had nearly three times the population of Argentina and almost five times that of Chile.|$|E
25|$|The {{relation}} between the complexity classes P and NP is studied in computational complexity theory, {{the part of the}} theory of computation dealing with the resources required during computation to <b>solve</b> <b>a</b> given problem. The most common resources are time (how many steps it takes to <b>solve</b> <b>a</b> problem) and space (how much memory it takes to <b>solve</b> <b>a</b> problem).|$|R

5|$|Mirror {{symmetry}} {{was originally}} discovered by physicists. Mathematicians {{became interested in}} this relationship around 1990 when Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed {{that it could be}} used as a tool in enumerative geometry, a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the number of solutions to geometric questions. Candelas and his collaborators showed that mirror symmetry could be used to count rational curves on a Calabi–Yau manifold, thus <b>solving</b> <b>a</b> longstanding problem. Although the original approach to mirror symmetry was based on physical ideas that were not understood in a mathematically precise way, some of its mathematical predictions have since been proven rigorously.|$|E
5|$|One way of {{clustering}} {{a set of}} {{data points}} in a metric space into two clusters is to choose the clusters {{in such a way}} as to minimize the sum of the diameters of the clusters, where the diameter of any single cluster is the largest distance between any two of its points. This is preferable to minimizing the maximum cluster size, which may lead to very similar points being assigned to different clusters. If the target diameters of the two clusters are known, a clustering that achieves those targets may be found by <b>solving</b> <b>a</b> 2-satisfiability instance. The instance has one variable per point, indicating whether that point belongs to the first cluster or the second cluster. Whenever any two points are too far apart from each other for both to belong to the same cluster, a clause is added to the instance that prevents this assignment.|$|E
5|$|Simulating the geodynamo {{requires}} numerically <b>solving</b> <b>a</b> set of nonlinear partial {{differential equations}} for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of the Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists {{were confined to}} creating kinematic dynamo computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and {{the effect on the}} magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo.|$|E

5|$|The game {{incorporates}} {{an inventory}} system for items that Sam picks {{up during the}} course of the game. Items can be used on other entities in the game world, or can often be combined with other inventory items to provide a new object necessary for <b>solving</b> <b>a</b> puzzle. Although Max's character will walk around the game's areas by his own will, Sam can also use Max at various points by using an inventory icon of Max's head on game objects—usually on characters where the solution to a problem involves violence. Sam and Max travel to different locations in the game using their black and white 1960 DeSoto Adventurer, which when clicked on in-game will present a map of the United States with all the available locations the pair can travel to shown. As the game progresses, the number of locations on the map increases.|$|E
5|$|The {{genesis of}} Radioland Murders came from {{executive}} producer/co-writer George Lucas's obsession with old-time radio. Lucas conceived the storyline {{of the film}} during the writing phase of American Graffiti, viewing it as a homage to the various Abbott and Costello films, primarily Who Done It (1942), in which Abbott and Costello star as two soda jerks <b>solving</b> <b>a</b> murder in a radio station. Radioland Murders also shares some inspiration from The Big Clock (1948). When Universal Pictures accepted American Graffiti in 1972, Lucas also allowed the studio first look deals for both Radioland Murders and an untitled science fiction film (which eventually {{became the basis for}} Star Wars).|$|E
5|$|This {{work was}} {{discovered}} by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in a Greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel, Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by <b>solving</b> <b>a</b> number of simultaneous Diophantine equations. There is a more difficult version {{of the problem in}} which some of the answers are required to be square numbers. This version of the problem was first solved by A. Amthor in 1880, and the answer is a very large number, approximately 7.760271.|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} computation, a human employs <b>a</b> {{computer to}} <b>solve</b> <b>a</b> problem; a human provides a formalized problem description and an algorithm to a computer, and receives {{a solution to}} interpret. Human-based computation frequently reverses the roles; the computer asks a person or {{a large group of}} people to <b>solve</b> <b>a</b> problem, then collects, interprets, and integrates their solutions.|$|R

5|$|In the {{rebuttal}} phases, {{a witness}} or a rival character provides {{their idea of}} what has happened. The player is able to press them for details, and can present relevant pieces of evidence that contradict what the witness or rival is saying. By doing this, the player gets closer to the truth; it is through confronting suspects during these phases that the player solves the cases. Upon <b>solving</b> <b>a</b> case, the episode is cleared and a new episode is {{made available to the}} player. If the player makes mistakes throughout the game, such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence, attempting to connect two thoughts that do not match up, or making incorrect choices, a green gauge called the Truth Gauge decreases, representing Edgeworth getting further from the truth. If it is completely emptied, the game ends. By clearing an investigation phase, half of the gauge is restored, and by clearing an episode, the gauge is restored completely.|$|E
5|$|Tronstad {{spent the}} first year of a {{research}} period as an assistant to Herbert Freundlich in Dahlem, Berlin. He studied the passivity of metal surfaces, and made a breakthrough when he managed to measure extremely thin oxide surface coatings, thus <b>solving</b> <b>a</b> problem dating from the time of Michael Faraday. He continued to Stockholm to study metallography under Carl Benedicks, and to elaborate further on his results from Berlin. The work was completed in 1931 and his thesis, spanning 250 pages, was published in German as Optische Untersuchungen zur Frage der Passivität des Eisens und Stahls. For it, he received the doctorate degree. He was hired at the Norwegian Institute of Technology as a lecturer in the summer of 1931, although he {{spent the first}} year at the University of Cambridge, conducting further research with a scholarship from a memorial fund of Christian Michelsen. The research at Cambridge was a continuation of his thesis work, but this time he tested his method on mercury.|$|E
