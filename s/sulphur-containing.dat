50|$|Lastly, {{the use of}} rats for the {{determination}} of protein quality is not ideal. Rats differ from humans in requirements of essential amino acids. This {{has led to a}} general criticism that experiments on rats lead to an over-estimation of the BV of high-quality proteins to man because human requirements of essential amino acids are much lower than those for rats (as rats grow at a much faster rate than humans). Also, because of their fur, rats are assumed to have relatively highrequirements of <b>sulphur-containing</b> amino acids (methionine and cysteine).|$|E

There is a relative deficiency in lysine and four other essential amino acids. The nutrient of greatest interest is gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid. For this reason evening primrose oil is a widely sold dietary supplement. The whole seeds can also be used similar to sesame roasted and in pastries.|$|E

5000|$|The {{recently}} developed liquid injection FD ionization (LIFDI) [...] technique [...] "presents {{a major breakthrough}} for FD-MS of reactive analytes": Transition metal complexes are neutral and due to their reactivity, do not undergo protonation or ion attachment. They benefit from both: the soft FD ionization and the safe and simple LIFDI transfer of air/moisture sensitive analyte solution. This transfer occurs from the Schlenk flask to the FD emitter in the ion source through a fused silica capillary without breaking the vacuum. LIFDI has been successfully coupled to a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer. The coupled system enables analysis of <b>sulphur-containing</b> materials in crude oil under extremely high mass resolving power conditions.|$|E

Results were obtained from three sources: urine, faeces, and expired air. Upon analysis of the urinary results, researchers discovered the formation of metabolite, N-acetyl-S-( [...] 1-bromo-3-propyl)-cysteine and {{the decline in the}} GSH content of the liver of the rats. This led to the assumption that 1,3-dibromopropane could have reacted with GSH after administration and gave rise to 1-bromo-3-propyl-S-glutathione, which ultimately form the urinary metabolite. Moreover, due to little radioactivity observed from faeces and the confirmation from maintained blood levels of radioactivity proved the occurrence of biliary excretion of <b>sulphur-containing</b> metabolites and enterohepatic cycling.|$|E

He had also written articles in Biochemisches Handlexikon on dextrin, inulin, alanine, leucine, histidine, proline, oxyproline, and indol, as well as various starches, celluloses, nitrogen-containing carbohydrates, <b>sulphur-containing</b> amino acids, indol-derivatives, and carbohydrates. In the Handbuch der biochemischen Arbeitsmethoden (1912-1913), Zemplén wrote about the production and detection of glucosides as well as other, higher carbohydrates. Professor Zemplén acted as a referee of several journals in chemistry. A reaction type (transesterifications among carbohydrate derivatives) was named after Zemplén.|$|E
50|$|Cooking {{treatments}} do {{not lead}} to variance in total protein and carbohydrate content. Soaking and cooking of dry seeds possibly induces chemical modification of protein-fibre complexes, which leads {{to an increase in}} crude fibre content. Thus, cooking can increase protein quality by inactivating or destroying heat-labile antinutritional factors. Cooking also increases protein digestibility, essential amino acid index, and protein efficiency ratio. Although cooking lowers concentrations of amino acids such as tryptophan, lysine, total aromatic, and <b>sulphur-containing</b> amino acids, their contents are still higher than proposed by the FAO/WHO reference. Diffusion of reducing sugars, raffinose, sucrose and others into cooking water reduces or completely removes these components. Cooking also significantly reduces fat and mineral contents. The B vitamins riboflavin, thiamin, niacin, and pyridoxine dissolve into cooking water at differing rates.|$|E
50|$|The {{nutritional}} {{value of the}} marama bean is astonishingly high for an unimproved legume. The tubers have a high protein content of 9.0% and also have a high amino acid content. The tubers of cassava, for example, only have a protein content of 1-3%, while yam has one of 7%. Also the grain is relatively high in protein with a share of 30-39%. The concentration of <b>sulphur-containing</b> amino acids is high as well (with a lysine content of 5.0% and a methionine content of 0.7%). This shows that the protein content of the seeds {{is comparable to the}} one of commercial soybeans, which have a content of 38-40%. Therefore, the potential of the marama bean is high to replace the soybean as a protein source, once there have been genetical improvements.|$|E
50|$|Intramolecular thiol-ene {{reactions}} {{provide a}} means to create <b>sulphur-containing</b> heterocycles. The radical-initiated thiol-ene reaction has enabled the successful synthesis of 4- to 8-membered rings, as well as macrocycles. While the radical thiol-ene reaction favors the anti-Markovnikov product, the regiochemistry of the cycloaddition depends on substituent effects and reaction conditions, which serve to direct the cyclization towards the thermodynamically or kinetically favored product respectively. This section examines intramolecular thiol-ene cyclization reactions, which yields a mixture of 5-exo and 6-endo products {{in order to facilitate}} a discussion of the factors, which may affect the regioselectivity of the intramolecular addition. This reaction has relevance for the synthesis of C-linked thiosugars. Both the furanose and pyranose thiosugars can be prepared from the same thiyl radical precursor; 5-exo and 6-endo cyclizations of this precursor form the respective desired compound. The conditions under which these cyclization reactions occur follow Baldwin's rules for ring closure.|$|E
5000|$|A study {{examining}} {{the effects of}} monofunctional adducts on bacterial growth reported {{a significant decrease in}} Escherichia coli (E. coli) cell growth when inoculated with phenanthriplatin. It also demonstrated that phenanthriplatin, like cisplatin, was able to dissolve lysogens as well as alter the morphology of E. coli into longer, filamentous cells. These results confirm that the drug’s anticancer activity is exerted through interacting with cells’ DNA. [...] Phenanthriplatin has been reported to have increased selectivity to cancerous cells compared to healthy cells, thereby reducing toxic side effects usually associated with current anticancer drugs and further supporting its potential use in chemotherapy. It has also been shown to have a lower tendency to react with other molecules in the body. Studies have reported that phenanthriplatin bound N-acetyl methionine, a <b>sulphur-containing</b> molecule, at a much lower rate compared to other monofunctional platinum adducts. This allows the drug to remain intact, facilitating its entry into the cell’s nucleus to effectively exert its anticancer activity.|$|E
50|$|Introduction {{of silver}} into {{bacterial}} cells induces {{a high degree}} of structural and morphological changes, which can lead to cell death. As the silver nano particles come in contact with the bacteria, they adhere to the cell wall and cell membrane. Once bound, some of the silver passes through to the inside, and interacts with phosphate-containing compounds like DNA and RNA, while another portion adheres to the <b>sulphur-containing</b> proteins on the membrane. The silver-sulphur interactions at the membrane cause the cell wall to undergo structural changes, like the formation of pits and pores. Through these pores, cellular components are released into the extracellular fluid, simply due to the osmotic difference. Within the cell, the integration of silver creates a low molecular weight region where the DNA then condenses. Having DNA in a condensed state inhibits the cell’s replication proteins contact with the DNA. Thus the introduction of silver nanoparticles inhibits replication and is sufficient to cause the death of the cell. Further increasing their effect, when silver comes in contact with fluids, it tends to ionize which increases the nanoparticles bactericidal activity. This has been correlated to the suppression of enzymes and inhibited expression of proteins that relate to the cell’s ability to produce ATP.|$|E
5000|$|Fungi {{have been}} shown to be viable organisms to conduct {{bioremediation}} and have been used to aid in the decontamination of a number of pollutants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, synthetic dyes, chlorophenols, explosives, crude oil and many others. [...] While fungi can breakdown many of these contaminants intracellularly, they also secrete numerous oxidative exoenzymes that work extracellularly. One critical aspect of fungi in regards to bioremediation is that they secrete these oxidative exoenzymes from their ever elongating hyphal tips. [...] Laccases are an important oxidative enzyme that fungi secrete and use oxygen to oxidize many pollutants. Some of the pollutants that laccases have been used to treat include dye-containing effluents from the textile industry, wastewater pollutants (chlorophenols, PAHs, etc.), and <b>sulphur-containing</b> compounds from coal processing.Bacteria are also a viable source of exoenzymes capable to facilitating the bioremediation of the environment. There are many examples of the use of bacteria for this purpose and their exoenzymes encompass many different classes of bacterial enzymes. Of particular interest in this field are bacterial hydrolases as they have an intrinsic low substrate specificity and can be used for numerous pollutants including solid wastes. [...] Plastic wastes including polyurethanes are particularly hard to degrade, but an exoenzyme has been identified in a Gram-negative bacterium, Comamonas acidovorans, that was capable of degrading polyurethane waste in the environment. [...] Cell-free use of microbial exoenzymes as agents of bioremediation is also possible although their activity is often not as robust and introducing the enzymes into certain environments such as soil has been challenging. [...] In addition to terrestrial based microorganisms, marine based bacteria and their exoenzymes show potential as candidates in the field of bioremediation. Marine based bacteria have been utilized in the removal of heavy metals, petroleum/diesel degradation and in the removal of polyaromatic hydrocarbons among others.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aims—While {{the social}} {{significance}} of flatus derives mainly from its odour, {{previous studies have}} focused on the non-odoriferous components of rectal gas. The aims of the present study were to determine the role of <b>sulphur-containing</b> gases in flatus odour and test the efficacy of a device purported to reduce this odour.  Methods—Flatus was quantitatively collected via rectal tube from 16 healthy subjects who ingested pinto beans and lactulose to enhance flatus output. The concentrations of <b>sulphur-containing</b> gases in each passage were correlated with odour intensity assessed by two judges. Odour intensity was also determined after treatment of flatus samples with zinc acetate, which binds sulphydryl compounds (hydrogen sulphide and methanethiol), or activated charcoal. Utilising gas-tight Mylar pantaloons, the ability of a charcoal lined cushion to adsorb <b>sulphur-containing</b> gases instilled at the anus of eight subjects was assessed.  Results—The main <b>sulphur-containing</b> flatus component was hydrogen sulphide (1. 06 (0. 2) µmol/l), followed by methanethiol (0. 21 (0. 04) µmol/l) and dimethyl sulphide (0. 08 (0. 01) µmol/l) (means (SEM)). Malodour significantly correlated with hydrogen sulphide concentration (p⩽ 0. 001). Zinc acetate reduced sulphur gas content but did not totally eliminate odour, while activated charcoal removed virtually all odour. The cushion adsorbed more than 90 % of the sulphur gases.  Conclusion—Sulphur-containing gases are the major, but not the only, malodorous components of human flatus. The charcoal lined cushion effectively limits the escape of these <b>sulphur-containing</b> gases into the environment. ...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} {{structural}} changes of sulfur-containing proteins exposed to radiation {{and the damage}} induced by thiyl radicals (RS•) generated from these proteins to unsaturated lipids in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVET). In particular, the production of H• atoms under reductive stress conditions was correlated to the specific damage of sulphur moieties of analyzed proteins with release of low-molecular-weight thiols. In parallel, it was demonstrated that structural changes of -amyloid (A) induced by NO 2 • and CO 3 •– radicals, involved mainly the oxidation of the Met 35. -Radiolysis {{was the source of}} oxidative damage in lipid vesicle suspensions (DOPC, POPC), in the presence of <b>sulphur-containing</b> either proteins (RNase A, lysozyme) or an amino acid (Met) that were used as source of thiyl radical damage occurring in vivo.

Methionine could be the main source of thiyl radicals. Control experiments in the absence of <b>sulphur-containing</b> proteins (RNase T 1) or by replacing <b>sulphur-containing</b> proteins with a protein lacking <b>sulphur-containing</b> amino acids, (histone H 1), did not show any isomerization.

40|$|L-cystine is a {{dispensable}} <b>sulphur-containing</b> amino acid, {{naturally occurring}} in proteins {{of plants and}} animals. L-cystine is safe for all animal species if the requirements for sulphur amino acids are respected. The maximum amount of L-cystine that can be safely added to the diet {{will depend on the}} levels of other <b>sulphur-containing</b> amino acids. Supplemental L-cystine will not be deposited in animal tissues as such: it will be incorporated in body proteins without causing any change in their natural composition or it will be metabolised and excreted. The product under application does not contain substances of toxicological concern. Thus, the use of L-cystine in animal nutrition does not raise any concerns for consumer safety. In the absence of any data, it would be prudent to consider L-cystine as irritant to skin, eyes and mucous membranes and as a potential dermal sensitiser. Therefore, it would be prudent to assume that exposure of skin, eyes and respiratory tract is hazardous.
