5|$|Minerals in {{the acid}} mine {{drainage}} {{areas of the}} Mahanoy Creek watershed include goethite, ferrihydrite, schwertmannite, amorphous aluminum-hydroxysulfates, quartz, muscovite, kaolinite, and gypsum. Red shale of the Mauch Chunk Formation is found in a <b>substantial</b> <b>part</b> of the watershed. The main rock types in the watershed are interbedded sedimentary rock, which occupies 70 percent of the watershed, and sandstone, which occupies 30 percent.|$|E
5|$|Salisbury's son Richard, {{the later}} Earl of Warwick, {{was born on}} 22November 1428; little is known of his childhood. At the age of six, Richard was betrothed to Anne Beauchamp, {{daughter}} of Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, and of his wife Isabel Despenser. This made him heir {{not only to the}} earldom of Salisbury, but also to a <b>substantial</b> <b>part</b> of the Montague, Beauchamp, and Despenser inheritance.|$|E

About 2,700 people commute into the town.

There is no major local government employment in the town, and the principal public sector employers are the Primary Care Trust and the schools.|$|E

5|$|An {{individual}} organism's phenotype {{results from}} both its genotype {{and the influence}} from the environment it has lived in. A <b>substantial</b> <b>part</b> of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation. The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative {{to other forms of}} that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.|$|E
5|$|Between 1797 and 1809 the First French Empire {{gradually}} {{occupied the}} entire eastern Adriatic coastline and a <b>substantial</b> <b>part</b> of its hinterland, ending the Venetian and the Ragusan republics, establishing the Illyrian Provinces. In response the Royal Navy started the blockade of the Adriatic Sea {{leading to the}} Battle of Vis in 1811. The Illyrian Provinces were captured by the Austrians in 1813, and absorbed by the Austrian Empire following the Congress of Vienna in 1815. This led to formation of the Kingdom of Dalmatia and restoration of the Croatian Littoral to the Kingdom of Croatia, now both under the same crown.|$|E
5|$|During the {{earthquake}} of 1905, there was large scale {{damage to the}} temple complex. <b>Substantial</b> <b>part</b> of the temples were damaged resulting in many broken parts seen lying scattered around the temple. Further, the heterogeneous structural compactness of the sandstone rock mass, from which the temples have been carved out, {{has contributed to the}} damage. A particular structural part of the temple which {{is not part of the}} main monolithic temple complex suffered severe damage to most of its circular columns which resulted in collapse of the mandapa and the roof (probably made of local timber) of the structure.|$|E

5|$|Like other {{nuthatch}}es, the white-breasted nuthatch forages for insects on {{trunks and}} branches {{and is able}} to move head-first down trees. Seeds form a <b>substantial</b> <b>part</b> of its winter diet, as do acorns and hickory nuts that were stored by the bird in the fall. The nest is in a hole in a tree, and the breeding pair may smear insects around the entrance as a deterrent to squirrels. Adults and young may be killed by hawks, owls, and snakes, and forest clearance may lead to local habitat loss, but this is a common species with no major conservation concerns over most of its range.|$|E

In addition to the east window, surviving visible fragments of the complex include the lower courses of the west range, a vaulted undercroft, a gateway and a 14th-century dovecote still in use today.

5|$|A {{concrete}} wall was {{built at the}} Grosvenor Road End for over £3,000 in 1956, as a safety precaution and as a support for additional banking and terracing. These improvements saw capacity extended to 23,600. Two FA Cup ties against First Division opposition were held at the ground in 1957–58: Birmingham City were beaten 3–0, followed by a 0–0 draw with Bolton Wanderers, which drew a capacity crowd of 23,600. Floodlights were installed at {{the ground in the}} summer of 1959, costing £14,500, a <b>substantial</b> <b>part</b> of which was raised by a supporters' club.

5|$|After {{five seasons}} with Lazio, Nedvěd was speculatively linked to several clubs (including Manchester United and Chelsea) {{before moving to}} Juventus in July 2001 for 75billionlire (€38.7million by fixed {{exchange}} rate). At Juventus, he replaced Zinedine Zidane, who had transferred to Real Madrid that summer. Nedvěd was a regular on Juventus' 2001–02 and 2002–03 Scudetto-winning teams. Although he was a <b>substantial</b> <b>part</b> of the club's championship season in 2003, {{he was also the}} subject of controversy. Nedvěd quit the Italian Footballers' Association in protest of the union's limit on non-European Union (EU) players; his native Czech Republic did not become an EU member until 2004. Although he was instrumental in leading Juventus to the 2003 UEFA Champions League final against Milan, he had to sit out the final due to an accumulation of yellow cards after his semi-final booking for a foul on Real Madrid midfielder Steve McManaman.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{appeared}} to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health, Nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless. Furthermore, he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a <b>substantial</b> <b>part</b> of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero; he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts, he accepted. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither the Senate nor Nerva appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy against Domitian.|$|E

5|$|Following Watkin's {{retirement}} {{relations between}} the GCR and the MR deteriorated badly. The GCR route to London ran over the MR from Quainton Road to London, and to reduce reliance on the hostile MR, GCR General Manager William Pollitt decided to create a link with the Great Western Railway and a route into London that bypassed the MR. In 1899 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway began {{construction of a new}} line, commonly known as the Alternative Route, to link the GWR at Princes Risborough to the GCR at Grendon Underwood, about three miles (5km) north of Quainton Road. Although formally an independent company, the new line was operated {{as a part of the}} GCR. A <b>substantial</b> <b>part</b> of GCR traffic to and from London was diverted onto the Alternative Route, reducing the significance of Quainton Road as an interchange and damaging the profitability of the MR.|$|E
5|$|NY373 exists entirely {{within the}} {{boundaries}} of Adirondack Park, a protected area maintained by the State of New York. Adirondack Park was created in the 1880s after concerns arose about logging trees in the area. The logging was a <b>substantial</b> <b>part</b> of New York's economy, but protests were lodged by The New York Times and others against the clearing of entire mountains and wilderness areas of trees. Public opinion turned firmly against the loggers by the 1880s, and the park was created in 1885. It was the first State Forest Preserve in America. The park was further protected in 1894 when a clause was added to the New York State constitution which banned the selling of timber from state parks.|$|E
5|$|Slow-swimming but active, the blackmouth {{catshark}} is a generalist that preys {{on a wide}} variety of crustaceans, cephalopods, and fishes. Its visual and electroreceptive systems are adept at tracking moving, bioluminescent prey. This species is oviparous, with females producing batches of up to 13 egg cases throughout the year. Because of its abundance, the {{blackmouth catshark}} forms a <b>substantial</b> <b>part</b> of the bycatch of deepwater commercial fisheries across much of its range. It has low economic value and is usually discarded, though the largest sharks may be marketed for meat and leather. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as there is no indication that its numbers have declined despite fishing pressure.|$|E
