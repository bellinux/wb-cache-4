500|$|In a 2014 radio interview, Perry {{revealed}} he had re-obtained {{the rights}} to Zoot Suit Riot from Jive Records and was planning on releasing a remixed and remastered edition, expressing a desire to revisit the original recordings with contemporary production values. He lamented {{the fact that the}} production of Zoot Suit Riot had been rushed and that only first takes had been used, noting that the band could have done [...] "2 or 3 more" [...] takes of the songs [...] "if we had known the future back in 1996", noting [...] "after 25 years , I would like to make the record <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> better". Zoot Suit Riot: The 20th Anniversary Edition was released on CD and vinyl on January 13, 2017.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1980s, Sam Tellig {{wrote in}} Stereophile that the Rega 3 [...] "is a good-sounding {{turntable}} {{and a good}} value—at the UK price ... it's a miracle that the Rega sounds {{as good as it}} does" [...] compared with the apparently better built Harman-Kardon T60. From a sound quality viewpoint, Tellig noted [...] "a very dynamic sound with powerful, punchy bass—the table conveys the music's excitement... too much emphasis of the mid- to upper-bass [...] tends to <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> muddy in bass detail". He added that the deck's pitch instability was audible [...] "every so often, particularly with woodwinds". Szabady, in Stereo Times, also agreed that musical expressiveness was the classic [...] strength; its weaknesses included occasional speed inconsistency and slurring of heavily modulated bass transients.|$|E
500|$|Kenny also {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Gary, SpongeBob's meowing sea snail, and the narrator in the episode. According to him, [...] "It was always Steve's intention that the narrator be a nod to his beloved Jacques Cousteau." [...] Kenny described Cousteau's voice as [...] "very dispassionate, very removed, very flatline, even when he’s describing something miraculous and beautiful." [...] At first, {{they found that the}} narrator [...] "just sounds bored," [...] so they decided that he [...] "has to <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fun and playful." [...] Kenny said, [...] "'Eet ees the most amazing thing I have ever seen I have ever seen in my life.' We found that after a while we had to make the narrator a little more playful than that." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Devourment {{signed a}} record deal with United Guttural and started {{developing}} its first album, Molesting the Decapitated, again produced by Braxton. The album was released later that year. Reviews were positive, with Blas, of Global Domination, who praised the album {{for being so}} brutal, claiming that [...] "if you look up the word 'Brutal' in the dictionary right now, you'd see Devourment's logo {{right next to the}} definition". He praised the vocals, but said that the drums, in places, let the album down due to them being too fast. Dan Staige, of Metal Review, said that the instruments were [...] "remarkably balanced and crisp", and his only criticism was that the [...] "ultra heavy breakdowns" [...] "may <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> monotonous", but that [...] "you will still bang your head".|$|E
500|$|... "Cowboy Style" [...] was {{recorded}} at Real World Studios, Sarm West and DMC Studios in London, England and was mixed by Alan Bremner at Real World. Instrumentally, Greg Bones and Anderson played the guitar, Johnnie Hardie played the fiddle, {{and all other}} instrumentals played by Anderson. [...] "Cowboy Style" [...] is a Celtic pop song that lasts a duration of four minutes and forty-four seconds. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that [...] "Cowboy Style features a tribal percussion break and a string quartet that sounds more Celtic than country." [...] Online music critic Adrian Denning compared the song {{to the work of}} Icelandic recording artist and songwriter Björk. Nick Levine from Digital Spy said [...] "Oh, and in 'Cowboy Style', it has a track that manages to <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit Celtic and a little bit Middle Eastern. Pete Waterman must have wept." ...|$|E
500|$|In The Guardian, Nicholas Lezard {{praised the}} idea behind the concert: [...] "One can imagine {{no better way to}} get {{children}} interested in classical music than by plonking them down in front of an orchestra belting out music from Doctor Who." [...] Lezard noted that the non-Doctor Who music [...] "was received with baffled tolerance"; he said that the BBC Philharmonic played [...] "Montagues and Capulets" [...] "crisply and excitingly", but felt that [...] "Ride of the Valkyries" [...] "tends to <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> underpowered unless played by two orchestras at once". Lezard called Gold's work [...] "a little derivative" [...] but [...] "perfectly suited to the task"; however, he complained that Gold's orchestration of the Doctor Who theme [...] "drowned" [...] Delia Derbyshire's original arrangement. He wrote that [...] "the hundred-strong choir and soloist Melanie Pappenheim performed flawlessly," [...] and also praised the technical execution of the complex programme.|$|E

500|$|Timothy Green from The Miami Herald {{said that}} [...] " [...] {{got a good}} beat and you can dance to it. Madonna's new album isn't really new, but rather a {{collection}} of danceable hits, remixed by club deejays masterful at that peculiar art of taking the artists' work, track by track, and reconstructing it. Most such remixes become 12-inch dance singles, and You Can Dance, is basically a compilation of these. The remixes sound fresh and gives a new outlook on the already famous and popular songs." [...] However, Daniel Brogan from the same newspaper praised the album, saying that [...] "Madonna has brought a new joy to the people buying gifts for Christmas, as You Can Dance is a fun-filled, fast-paced retrospective that will burn the dance floor till New Year." [...] Richard Harrington from The Washington Post called the album [...] "an energetic collection of extended dance remixes, that will surely be {{the highlight of the}} party crowds flocking around the town." [...] John Milward from USA Today felt that [...] "although the remixes <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> exhaustive, its nevertheless party time with Madonna's album." [...] Jan DeKnock from the Chicago Tribune was not impressed with the album, calling it calculative.|$|E
500|$|For the {{majority}} of the recordings, Saadiq played most of the instruments, including bass, keyboard, guitar, Mellotron, percussion, and drums, and he also layered each recorded instrumental part afterwards. Brungardt used a Neumann U 47 microphone to record each of Saadiq's instrument parts. Saadiq recorded his vocals on a dynamic microphone alone in the recording studio's control room, an approach encouraged to him earlier in his career by record producer and audio engineer Gerry Brown. According to Brungardt, [...] " [...] voice benefits from a dynamic mic because it tends to give him more bottom and presence. Plus dynamic mics can <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> older when pushed". With the songs' guitar parts, Brungardt wanted to create additional distortion in order to produce a grittier guitar sound for the songs, a stylistic preference Saadiq and he had acquired from listening to a great deal of indie rock at the time. He applied several techniques to achieve this sound, including increasing the gain on Saadiq's Fender Twin guitar amplifier, using a software plug-in for the recordings in post-production, and re-amping Saadiq's guitar parts. In his interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt discussed using a Massey TapeHead, one of his preferred plug-ins, in the recording process, stating [...] "I’ll use that {{on a lot of things}} to get a little more grit. It thickens stuff up nicely if you record something that’s a little too bright. I usually go a lot for darker tones when recording and mixing".|$|E
500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{called it}} [...] "a true movie milestone, {{presenting}} awe- and fear-inspiring sights {{never before seen}} on the screen... On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents... t becomes less crisp on screen than {{it was on the}} page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away." [...] In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers described the film as [...] "colossal entertainment—the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year [...] Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed. Crichton and co-screenwriter David Koepp have flattened them into nonentities on the trip from page to screen." [...] Roger Ebert noted, [...] "The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values." [...] Henry Sheehan argued, [...] "The complaints over Jurassic Parks lack of story and character <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> off the point," [...] pointing out the story arc of Grant learning to protect Hammond's grandchildren despite his initial dislike of them. Empire magazine gave the film five stars, hailing it as [...] "quite simply one of the greatest blockbusters of all time." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 16, 2006, Regan {{issued a}} {{statement}} claiming that her reason for recording the interview and releasing the book {{was an attempt to}} find closure after having been a battered woman herself. [...] "The men who lied and cheated and beat me – they were all there in the room," [...] she said. [...] "And the people who denied it, they were there, too. And though it might <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> strange, Nicole and Ron were in my heart. And for them I wanted him to confess his sins, do penance, and to amend his life. Amen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, {{the album}} met with mixed reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album a {{favorable}} review but noted that [...] "even {{a few years}} on from its 1994 release, Portrait of an American Family began to <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dated, especially since its Nine Inch Nails-meets-W.A.S.P.-meets-Alice Cooper formula was fully realized on Manson's follow-up album, Antichrist Superstar. Here, it's in sketch form, {{and by the end}} of the album it's clear that Warner, Manson, whatever you want to call him, needs a full canvas to truly wreak havoc." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album a negative review and said that [...] "Manson's debut [...] isn't the sharply rendered cultural critique of America he'd like you to think it is. Most of the record comes off like some low-budget horror movie.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 November 2004, he {{announced}} he would not stand at the next general election {{and that he would}} retire from the House of Commons. On 26 November, in an interview with Robin Oakley on Radio 4, he said [...] "To be honest I found it intellectually numbing, and tedious in the extreme. I most certainly won't miss the constituency work. I've got to tell you that honestly. It's 22 years of the same cases, but just the faces and the people changing. It might <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> disparaging to say this about people's lives and their problems and we did deal with them ... but I got no satisfaction from this at all. I really didn't. And all you were was a sort of high-powered social worker and perhaps not even a good one at that. I will miss being chairman of the works of art committee [...] [...] [...] because I was having so much intellectual enjoyment, and indeed just straightforward fun, out of reorganising our collection, and that kept me in touch with history." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> harsh; <b>a</b> good harvest {{might have}} set him straight," [...] he said. [...] "However, I suppose {{you have a}} reason for what you're doing." ...|$|R

2500|$|Sebastian {{said in an}} {{interview}} in late 2009 that the songs for the album originally had a much more organic old school sound, as his US record company had wanted the album to have a similar sound to The Memphis Album. He said he didn't feel that was right for the Australian market, [...] "I ended up with a new record of original songs that didn't have quite the right production, like it all sounded quite old school, it didn't really have a modern edge to it. I ended up going back and reproducing everything which was quite a nightmare. I mean [...] "Like It Like That" [...] for example was really old school, like real drums, real organic, so we reproduced that and we got it to <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more modern, in your face I guess, the way it is now and we did that with a lot of the tracks so yeah, it was a bit of a nightmare getting to the final product". Sebastian said he felt he was exactly where he wanted to be creatively with this album: [...] "I'm in a really happy place musically, because this is exactly the style of music I want to do and that I've wanted to do for so long. It's not about me changing the world; it's just about fun music - pure and simple. Music is so powerful. It's powerful enough on a personal level, without me trying to change the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doesn't that <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like {{refining}} {{upon the}} facts? Recollect: I've never seen her, and I don't say you're wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I must {{hear the}} play as it stood in your {{thoughts}} when you wrote it," [...] she insisted. [...] "I have a fancy {{that it will}} <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gloomy. Am I right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hum!' murmured the curate; {{there was}} really nothing {{questionable}} in that, {{but he was just}} slightly prejudiced against a man who made such <b>a</b> quotation; it <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> priggish.|$|R
6000|$|Milly {{was ready}} to engage for {{anything}}; but in respect to the facts--as they so far possessed them--it all <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> complicated. [...] "Is it because there's anything between them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> provincial, but we lawyers exist {{by reason}} of provincialism. If people were once to begin making {{allowances}} for each other, I don't know where we should be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To be sure!' said Dolores, 'but Aunt Jane {{always does}} {{look out for}} what nobody else cares about. Still I wouldn't send the baby-verses to Uncle Alfred, for they do <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit goody, and the 'Evening Star' would be better.' ...|$|E
6000|$|His assent was instant. [...] "You {{think it}} not quite like me? You are right. It does <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lurid. I may never write it, but if I do, {{you may be}} sure it will be treated {{in my own way}} and not in Hawthorne's way." ...|$|E
