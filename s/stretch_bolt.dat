50|$|The final {{was held}} {{following}} a light rainstorm that affected the women's javelin throw. The track was still wet and conditions cooler. Still the stadium was electric to see lightning, the star Usain Bolt {{in what was}} expected to be his last individual race in the Olympics. Bolt was in lane 6, playing to the camera and to the crowd before the race. Lemaitre and Martina were to his outside. Bolt got a good start and quickly made up the stagger on Lemaitre then Martina barely halfway through the turn. Inside of him, DeGrasse got out well in lane 4 while Merritt lagged in 5. As the stagger began to resolve {{near the end of the}} turn, Bolt held a two-metre lead over a wall of chasers.Martina held a slight edge on DeGrasse and Edward inside of him in lane 3 who were barely ahead of Merritt and Gemili, with Lemaitre slightly behind. Bolt was 9.9 at the half way mark. Down the home <b>stretch,</b> <b>Bolt</b> was working hard, his face showing the strain. Behind him, DeGrasse was starting to separate from the row of contenders. Only Guliyev was beaten. As they approached the finish Edwards and Merritt faded. Bolt had a 3-metre gap over DeGrasse, another metre and a half back, Lemaitre, Gemili, and Martina hit the finish line together. The photo finish revealed Lemaitre to be the bronze medalist, with only six thousandths of a second separating the three runners.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. At {{the turn}} of the last century, bolt {{supporting}} of coal roadway had rapidly developed with the applied range of <b>bolt</b> <b>stretching</b> continually. The <b>bolt</b> supporting in roadway has been implemented widely. But until now, there is no reliable theoretical support or appraisal system on the design of bolt supporting roadway and the evaluation of supporting conditions. Supporting effect is tested only by practice and roof-fall accidents take place repeatedly. This paper conducts the research on the bolt supporting parameters in No. 315 transportation-up-hill roadway of Nan Ye Coal Mine with numerical analysis method; it is discovered that numerical analysis can be a good way to predict and evaluate roadway supporting effects to be worthy popularizing...|$|R

5000|$|A nut {{is a type}} of {{fastener}} with a threaded hole. Nuts {{are almost}} always used in conjunction with a mating bolt to fasten multiple parts together. The two partners are kept together by a combination of their threads' friction (with slight elastic deformation), a slight <b>stretching</b> of the <b>bolt,</b> and compression of the parts to be held together.|$|R
50|$|Tighten {{the bolts}} on the flange. Due to vibration, {{temperature}} changes, {{and other factors}} such as spiral wound gasket stress relaxation, the bolt tension will gradually decrease, resulting in loss of torque, causing a leak. In general longer bolts and smaller diameters of bolt are better at preventing the loss of torque. A long thin bolt is {{an effective way to}} prevent torque loss. Heating for {{a certain period of time}} to <b>stretch</b> the <b>bolt,</b> and then maintaining a given torque, is very effective in preventing the loss of torque. When the gasket is thinner and smaller there will be a greater loss of torque. In addition, prevent strong vibration of the machine and the pipe itself, and isolate them from adjacent equipment vibration. Impacts on the sealing surface are not meaningless. Not impacting the tightened bolts can prevent the loss of torque.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{cylinder}} head design (Removal of the heads {{was designed to}} be accomplished whilst leaving the camshaft and valvetrain in place), head bolts were both vertically and diagonally set in the engine block, to be accessible around the camshafts. As the bolts were made of the same material and set on different angles; this created areas of different expansion under heat, creating not only head warping but resulting in extremely difficult to remove cylinder heads as <b>bolts</b> <b>stretched</b> and corroded in place at different rates.|$|R

TTY bolts offer {{some of the}} most precise clamping force available, but can be problematic. In certain situations (Oil cooler/EGR cooler failure, high boost/load levels brought on by improper use of aftermarket programmers) TTY <b>bolts</b> can be <b>stretched</b> beyond their torque mark by increased cylinder pressures. This has never been addressed by Ford {{due to the fact that}} other malfunctions or abuse must occur to <b>stretch</b> the <b>bolts.</b> Some in the aftermarket will replace the factory bolts with head studs in an attempt to protect the head gaskets from future failure. If this is done without addressing the underlying issue, the head gaskets may fail again bringing along a cracked or warped {{cylinder head}}. In contrast, the Powerstroke 7.3s and 6.7s have 6 head bolts per cylinder while the IDI 7.3s and 6.9s have five.|$|R
50|$|A {{torque wrench}} is used where the {{tightness}} of screws and bolts is crucial. It allows the operator {{to measure the}} torque applied to the fastener {{so it can be}} matched to the specifications for a particular application. This permits proper tension and loading of all parts. A torque wrench measures torque as a proxy for bolt tension. The technique suffers from inaccuracy due to inconsistent or uncalibrated friction between the fastener and its mating hole. Measuring bolt tension (indirectly via <b>bolt</b> <b>stretch)</b> is actually what is desired, but often torque is the only practical measurement which can be made.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} based on the {{plankton}} collected in Shibushi Bay, Kagoshima Prefecture. Collections were made in May, August and November, 1969 using the Kitahara 2 Ì† 7 s quantitative net (20 cm in diameter and <b>stretched</b> with <b>bolting</b> silk net XX No. 13) from the bottom to the sea surface. According to the results of these observations settling volume of plankton organisms varies from 0. 9 cc/m^ 3 to 77. 5 cc/m^ 3 and shows a high productivity in August and November. Eighty-seven species of plankton Copepods and seventy-five species of Diatoms have been identified during these observations. In quantity, Diatom is the most important group, especially, Thalassiothrix frauenferdii, Thalassionema nitzschioides and Skeletonema costatum which dominate throughout the year. Total number of Diatom cells vary from 2000 to 6000 per litre. The zooplankton communities were represented by Oithona nana with Paracalanus parvus; or by Oithona similis and Oncaea media in the inner part of the bay, and Paracalanus parvus with Calocalanus pavo, Calocalanus styliremis etc. in the outer part of the bay. Copepods varies from 100 to 4000 in number per cubic metre. ...|$|R
25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in <b>stretching</b> the <b>bolt</b> and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|R

40|$|The {{threaded}} fasteners {{are one of}} the most versatile methods for assembly of structural components. For example, in bridges large bolts are used to fix base columns and small bolts are used to support access ladders. Naturally not all bolts are critical for the operation of the structure. Fasteners loaded with small forces and present in large quantities do not receive the same treatment as the critical bolts. Typical maintenance operations such tension measurements, internal stress checking or monitoring of crack development are not practical due to cost and time constrains. Although failure of a single non-critical fastener is not a significant threat to the structure 2 Ì† 7 s stability, massive malfunction may cause structural problem such as insufficient stiffness or excessive vibrations. The health of bolted joints is defined by a single parameter: the clamping force (CF). The CF is the force that holds the elements of the joint together. If the CF is too low, separation and bolt fatigue may occur. On the other hand, excessive CF may produce damages in the structural members such as excessive distortion or breakage. The CF is generated by the superposition of the individual tension of the bolts. The bolt tension, also referred as bolt preload, is the actual force that is <b>stretching</b> the <b>bolt</b> body. Maintaining the appropriate tension in bolts ensures a proper CF and hence a good health of the joint. In this thesis, a novel methodology for estimating the tension in bolts using surface acoustic waves (SAWs) is investigated. The tension is estimated by using the reflection of SAWs created by the bolt head interference. Increments in the bolt tension raise the points of interaction between the waves and the bolt head (real area of contact), and hence the position of the reflective boundaries. The variations are estimated using the 2 Ì† 2 conventional linear synthetic array 2 Ì† 2 imaging technique. A singular transducer is actuated from predefined positions to produce an array of signals that are subsequently arranged and added to construct an acoustic image. Three sets of experiment are presented in this research for validating the proposed concept: tension estimation of a Â¼ inch stainless steel bolt, a Â½ inch stainless steel bolt and Â¼ inch grade 8 bolt. Acoustic images of the surface of the clamped plate illustrate a clear trend in the position of the reflective boundary when torque is changed. In all cases, the torque increments increase the real area of contact and therefore the position of the reflective boundary. As expected, the real area of contact grew from the bolt head center to the perimeter, which causes an effect of apparent movement of the boundary. This research proves the potential of the ultrasonic imaging methodology to measure applied tension. The result showed that the system can be used to successfully inspect tension in bolts of Â½ and Â¼ inches. The methodology investigated in this thesis is the first steps towards the development of bolt tension sensor based on surface acoustic waves...|$|R
40|$|This {{story begins}} in the 1970 s, when Dr. Joseph Heyman, a young {{scientist}} at NASA s Langley Research Center, was asked to support the investigation of a wind tunnel accident at a sister center. Although the work was outside of his physics background, it sparked a research focus that guided his lengthy NASA career and would earn him a slew of accolades, including NASA s highest award medals for Exceptional Leadership, Exceptional Achievement, and Exceptional Service; the coveted Silver Snoopy Astronaut Award for Space Shuttle Return to Flight; and the Arthur Fleming Award for {{being one of the}} Top Ten Federal Scientists in Government Service. He won 30 additional NASA awards, including the Agency s Invention of the Year and the Agency s highest award for technology transfer, and was the only person to ever win 4 R&D 100 Awards. Back in 1973, though, Heyman was a young civil servant with a background in physics who was asked to sit on an accident review panel. The panel met at Ames Research Center, in Moffet Field, California, and after considerable investigation, concluded that a high-pressure pebble heater used for heating gas had failed, due to improperly tightened bolts in a 1, 000 -pound gate valve control section. The accident showered the facility with incendiary ceramic spheres and nearly a ton of metal, but, luckily, caused no injuries. Heyman returned to Langley and began work on a solution. He developed an ultrasonic device that would measure bolt elongation, as opposed to torque, the factor typically measured in testing bolt preload or tension. Torque measurement can lead to load errors, with miscalculations as high as 80 percent that can be passed over during installation. <b>Bolt</b> <b>stretch,</b> however, is nearly always accurate to 1 percent or better. Within 1 month, he had an acoustic resonance solution that accurately determined bolt elongation. He assumed his work on this project had ended, but it was actually the start of nearly 15 years of work perfecting, improving, inventing, and modifying the "bolt monitor", all the while, filing numerous patents, presenting papers, and holding demonstrations as the technology matured. Industry engineers challenged Heyman s inventiveness, and reminded the physicist that most bolts are not perfect resonators, and that early devices required that the bolt have reasonably flat and parallel faces. The U. S. Geological Survey asked NASA for help in determining the load in mine roof bolts, which are 8 - to 10 -feet-long and rough cut. To solve that problem, Heyman modified the original device to operate at a lower frequency and to generate propagation modes {{that could be used to}} "lock" the instrument on a particular mode. Further work in this vein led to the development of the Pulsed Phase Locked Loop (P 2 L 2) that worked on the mine bolts. The next set of problems involved high-strength bolts with head markings. For this solution, Heyman invented a modified P 2 L 2 that tracked a specific phase point in the measurement wave. This class of instrumentation, well suited to measuring small changes in acoustic velocity, won the NASA "Invention of the Year" award in 1982. Other scientists and engineers have continued the evolution of this technology both inside NASA and outside of the Agency. Within NASA, the technology has been improved for medical applications, with a particular focus on intercranial pressure (ICP) monitoring...|$|R
