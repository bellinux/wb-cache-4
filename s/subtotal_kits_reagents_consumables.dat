40|$|A {{regional}} external {{quality assessment}} scheme (REQAS) for anti-HIV serology aimed to objectively assess reliability {{and quality of}} HIV testing processes in the African region. This involved the distribution of proficiency testing (PT) panels to participating laboratories from 2002 to 2010. During the survey period, this included 16 distributions of PT panels to 49 laboratories in 30 countries, and the overall average score during the nine-year survey period was 98. 9 %, with a frequency of accurate detection, of anti-HIV- 1 and/or anti-HIV- 2 antibodies in the PT panels, ranging from 93 % to 100 %. Problems highlighted included lack of human resources and frequent stock outs of test <b>kits,</b> <b>reagents</b> and <b>consumables</b> for routine HIV testing. The design of the REQAS allowed appraisal of the reliability of anti-HIV serological testing methods utilised by laboratories for clinical assessment of patients and/or surveillance programmes. The REQAS was able to demonstrate that laboratories participating in the REQAS performed well and sustained {{their participation in the}} scheme. This bodes well for clinical diagnosis, surveillance and training activities at these reference laboratories. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Cryptococcal {{meningitis}} is a {{major cause}} of mortality and morbidity in countries with high HIV prevalence, primarily affecting patients whose CD 4 are < = 100 cells/μl. Routine Cryptococcal Antigen (CrAg) screening is thus recommended in the South African HIV treatment guidelines for all patients with CD 4 counts < = 100 cells/μl, followed by pre-emptive anti-fungal therapy where CrAg results are positive. A laboratory-based reflexed CrAg screening approach, using a Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) on remnant EDTA CD 4 blood samples, was piloted at three CD 4 laboratories. This study aimed to assess the cost-per-result of laboratory-based reflexed CrAg screening at one pilot CD 4 referral laboratory. CD 4 test volumes from 2014 were extracted to estimate percentage of CD 4 < = 100 cells/μl. Daily average volumes were derived, assuming 12 months per/year and 21. 73 working days per/month. Costing analyses were undertaken using Microsoft Excel and Stata with a provider prospective. The cost-per-result was estimated using a bottom-up method, inclusive of test <b>kits</b> and <b>consumables</b> (<b>reagents),</b> laboratory equipment and technical effort costs. The ZAR/$ exchange of 14. 696 /$ 1 was used, where applicable. One-way sensitivity analyses on the cost-per-result were conducted for possible error rates (3 %- 8 %, reductions or increases in reagent costs as well as test volumes (ranging from - 60 % to + 60 %). The pilot CD 4 laboratory performed 267000 CD 4 tests in 2014; ~ 9. 3 % (27500) reported CD 4 < = 100 cells/μl, equivalent to 106 CrAg tests performed daily. A batch of 30 -tests could be performed in 1. 6 hours, including preparation and analysis time. A cost-per-result of $ 4. 28 was reported, with reagents contributing $ 3. 11 (72. 8 %), while technical effort and laboratory equipment overheads contributed $ 1. 17 (27. 2 %) and $ 0. 03 (< 1 %) respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses including increasing or decreasing test volumes by 60 % revealed a cost-per-result range of $ 3. 84 to $ 6. 03. A cost-per-result of $ 4. 28 was established in a typical CD 4 service laboratory to enable local budgetary cost projections and programmatic cost-effectiveness modelling. Varying reagent costs linked to currency exchange and varying test volumes in different levels of service can lead to varying cost-per-test and technical effort to manage workload, with an inverse relationship of higher costs expected at lower volumes of tests...|$|R
