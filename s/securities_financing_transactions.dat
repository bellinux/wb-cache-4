3000|$|The new Basel III {{definition}} {{requires that}} the numerator consists of loss-absorbing equity capital, i.e., dominantly CET 1 and a proportion of AT 1. This is a markedly stricter definition than the Basel II BIS Tier 1 capital definition. In particular, the Basel III definition excludes any hybrid capital items, which {{were found in the}} financial crisis to be poor in absorbing losses. Also the definition of the denominator of the Basel III leverage ratio (LRD) goes beyond the definition of balance sheet assets. It additionally includes off-balance sheet items and treats the calculation of <b>securities</b> <b>financing</b> <b>transactions</b> and derivatives in its own way. 34 [...]...|$|E

40|$|What are {{the steps}} {{involved}} in calculating credit exposure? What are {{the differences between}} counterparty and contract-level exposure? How can margin agreements be used to reduce counterparty credit risk? What is credit value adjustment and {{how can it be}} measured? Michael Pykhtin and Steven Zhu offer a blueprint for modelling credit exposure and pricing counterparty risk. Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial contract will default prior to the expiration of the contract and will not make all the payments required by the contract. Only the contracts privately negotiated between counterparties — over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and <b>security</b> <b>financing</b> <b>transactions</b> (SFT) — are subject to counterparty risk. Exchange-traded derivatives are not affected by counterparty risk, because the exchange guarantees the cash flows promised by the derivative t...|$|R

40|$|In {{the period}} {{prior to the}} {{financial}} crisis, leverage in the financial system increased substantially. This buildup was likely facilitated by, among other factors, a loosening of credit terms related to OTC derivatives and <b>securities</b> <b>financing</b> <b>transactions.</b> However, little or no systematic data on these trends were available at the time. The new Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, which was conducted {{for the first time}} in June 2010, partially fills this gap. The new survey provides qualitative information about changes in credit terms and conditions across the entire range of these transactions, and the evolution of market conditions and conventions applicable to such activities.

40|$|During {{recent years}} the {{counterparty}} risk subject has received a growing attention because of the so called Basel Accord. In particular the Basel III Accord asks the banks to fulfill finer conditions concerning counterparty credit exposures arising from banks' derivatives, <b>securities</b> <b>financing</b> <b>transactions,</b> default and downgrade risks characterizing the Over The Counter (OTC) derivatives market, etc. Consequently the development of effective and more accurate measures of risk have been pushed, particularly focusing on the estimate of the future fair value of derivatives with respect to prescribed time horizon and fixed grid of time buckets. Standard methods used to treat the latter scenario are mainly based on ad hoc implementations of the classic Monte Carlo (MC) approach, which {{is characterized by a}} high computational time, strongly dependent on the number of considered assets. This is why many financial players moved to more enhanced Technologies, e. g., grid computing and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) capabilities. In this paper we show how to implement the quantization technique, in order to accurately estimate both pricing and volatility values. Our approach is tested to produce effective results for the counterparty risk evaluation, with a big improvement concerning required time to run when compared to MC approach.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether managerial discretion over {{loan loss}} accruals, accounting related transactions such as sales of investment <b>securities,</b> and <b>financing</b> <b>transactions</b> {{are used to}} manage capital, earnings or taxes. We model discretion over these decisions using a system of five equations generated from an underlying cost minimization problem. The estimated parameters of the system suggest that banks manage both capital and earnings using accounting, investment, and financing discretion. Tax management appears to be relatively unimportant in the discretion exercised over these transactions. The framework we use highlights trade-offs among accounting and <b>financing</b> <b>transactions.</b> We find that accounting sources of capital in part determine banks' propensity to issue new securities, and that the positive reported capital effects of gains from transactions such as asset sales in part determine manager's willingness to charge-off loans. 1 Introduction This paper investigates if ban [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Regulators {{aiming to}} ward off the next {{financial}} market failure need to implement rules to smooth the boom-bust cycle in margin requirements and haircuts used in <b>securities</b> <b>financing</b> and derivative <b>transactions,</b> which seriously exacerbated the last financial crisis. In this study, the author argues that key elements in a system-wide regulatory framework should include rules to mitigate swings between loose terms for margins and haircuts in boom times, and tightened terms during busts. Longworth emphasizes “through-the-cycle” haircuts and initial margins, the potential use of add-ons to haircuts and margins by macroprudential authorities, and market practices that are less procyclical than they were before and during the crisis.

40|$|Infrastructure {{development}} {{represents one}} of the major hindrances to economic growth and social development across all countries worldwide. A one percent increase in GDP is expected in a country with an estimated ten percent increase in infrastructure assets. Private project and structured financing is identified as the most effective tool for the provision of the required infrastructure. The complexity, formidable risks and highly leveraged nature of project and structured <b>financing</b> <b>transactions</b> account for the mismatch between the numbers of infrastructure <b>financing</b> <b>transactions</b> that reach financial close compared to the available pipeline. Increased literature focusing on the public sector procurer and private sector contractor is available in project and structured <b>financing</b> <b>transactions,</b> but scarce research focuses on the risk assessment processes applied by financiers to the due diligence of transactions. In this study, 15 in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with financing experts representing a diverse set of expertise with varying levels of experience in different markets. ATLAS. ti was used to analyse, code and identify themes in the data collected. The findings indicate a wide range of risks and scenarios are considered by financiers with the top risks being political or sovereign risk followed by construction risk.
