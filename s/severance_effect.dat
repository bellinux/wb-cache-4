Immobility has a marked geographical dimension in what is a segregated city. But income has only limited explanatory power. The population structure, with high proportions of people who are not in the labour force and who are unemployed, accounts for the high levels of immobility in the poor districts. Although population structure effects prevail, spatial factors such as the <b>severance</b> <b>effect</b> also account for differences between districts. Indeed, Rio de Janeiro features many different types of barriers that affect immobility in several districts and for several population groups. These barriers may be physical or symbolic and perceptive. This study proposes therefore to identify the scope of those barriers as they affect immobility. Our findings from the latest household travel survey available for the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro (2003) illustrate the effects of the two types of barrier, physical or symbolic and perceptive, on immobility that more specifically mark out certain categories of individuals such as housewives, the elderly, the unemployed or poor workers. Conversely, the wealthier active population seems to be little affected by the two types of barriers under study. Lastly, our results show that social fragmentation does not lead to greater immobility of favela populations in the heart of rich districts, but on the contrary to increased mobility, especially for the working age population in employment or looking for employment...|$|E
50|$|It {{was first}} planned by Herbert Manzoni in 1943 and an Act of Parliament {{permitting}} construction {{was passed in}} 1946. Due to financial controls, {{the first part of}} the ring road, Smallbrook Queensway, did not begin construction until 1957 and was completed in 1960. The entire ring road was opened by Elizabeth II in 1971.However, since the 1990s, some of Queensway has been altered in order to reverse the earlier strict separation of road and pedestrian traffic with a view to providing a more attractive environment for pedestrians, deter through traffic, and reducing the <b>severance</b> <b>effects</b> of the Inner Ring Road. A number of the altered junctions are in regeneration areas, such as Masshouse. In early 2008, the St Chads Queensway area near the St. Chad's Cathedral was modified to remove pedestrian underpasses and bring all pedestrian and car traffic back on to the traditional street level.|$|R
40|$|Combating the {{undesirable}} effects of mobility in cities {{caused by the}} use of the private car has become a key issue in the development of sustainable urban policy. Associated with car use are a number of well-documented problems including rising levels of energy consumption, road congestion, greenhouse gas emissions and pollution as well as road safety, health and <b>severance</b> <b>effects</b> (European Commission, 2007 a). Underlying these problems is a complex process which involves interaction between rising levels of car ownership, the development of road transport provision and the location decisions of individuals and businesses in and around cities. The process has resulted in the emergence of new urban forms typified by the decentralisation of activities and the unstructured expansion of urban areas into the surrounding countryside otherwise known as urban sprawl (European Environment Agency, 2006). New suburban residential neighbourhoods, characterised by low density, single-use development, reinforce the dominance of the car as the principal, or sometimes sole, form of transport to access everyday activities...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} exit of a subsidiary from its corporate parent through spin-off, the {{actions taken by}} the firm management post spin-off, and the performance implications of those actions, all from the spin-off's perspective. While spin-off announcements are generally met with a positive stock market reaction, what occurs post spin-off remains largely unexamined, with performance predictions regarding spin-off firms often being equivocal. This raises questions as to what generates positive performance for spin-off firms, with agency, transaction cost, and upper echelons theories offering differing, and sometimes conflicting, predictions. By integrating these theoretical perspectives, a model of managerial action and its performance implications is presented. The model examines how the formation of new top management, the establishment of managerial monitoring and incentives, and the <b>severance</b> <b>effects</b> from leaving the corporate structure affect strategic, financial, and institutional actions, and how these actions affect performance. The theory and hypotheses developed in this research are empirically tested on a sample of 176 corporate spin-offs completed by publicly traded firms between 1986 and 1997. Results for the action-based models indicate that background of the CEO or the TMT, as well as CEO options, {{had no effect on}} actions. CEO and TMT ownership had opposite effects on financial actions, with TMT ownership increasing the likelihood of strategic actions and CEO ownership increasing the likelihood of institutional actions. Ownership by the parent firm and monitoring by officers of the parent serving as board members had no effect on the likelihood of actions, although having a chairman of the board from the parent decreased the likelihood of strategic actions. Finally, <b>severance</b> <b>effects</b> had limited influence on the actions taken post spin-off. Results for the performance-based models indicate that strategic actions were negatively related to ROA, while financial and institutional actions are positively related to ROA and institutional actions are positively related to market performance. In general, inaction was related to lower Tobin's q, with the signs of the coefficients for the other performance models negative, but not significant. Finally, the spin-off firm's relationship with its corporate parent had limited effect on the link between actions and performance...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that belowground self-recognition in clonal plants can be disrupted between sister ramets {{by the loss}} of connections or long distances within a genet. However, these results may be confounded by severing connections between ramets in the setups. Using Potentilla reptans, we examined <b>severance</b> <b>effects</b> in a setup that grew ramet pairs with connections either intact or severed. We showed that severance generally reduced new stolon mass but had no effect on root allocation of ramets. However, it did reduce root mass of younger ramets of the pairs. We also explored evidence for physiological self-recognition with another setup that avoided severing connections by manipulating root interactions between closely connected ramets, between remotely connected ramets and between disconnected ramets within one genet. We found that ramets grown with disconnected neighbors had less new stolon mass, similar root mass but higher root allocation as compared to ramets grown with connected neighbors. There was no difference in ramet growth between closely connected- and remotely connected-neighbor treatments. Thus, we suggest that severing connections affects ramet interactions by disrupting their physiological integration. Using the second setup, we provide unbiased evidence for physiological self-recognition, while also suggesting that it can persist over long distances...|$|R
40|$|We {{identify}} the causal <b>effect</b> of lump-sum <b>severance</b> payments on non- employment duration in Norway by exploiting a discontinuity in eligibility at age 50. We {{find that a}} severance payment worth 1. 2 months' earnings at the median lowers the fraction re-employed after a year by six percentage points. Data on household wealth enable us to verify that the effect is decreasing in prior wealth, which supports {{the view that the}} <b>severance</b> pay <b>effect</b> should be interpreted as evidence of liquidity constraints. Finding liquidity constraints in Norway, despite its equitable wealth distribution and generous welfare state, means they are likely to exist also in other countries.

40|$|Ewe verbs {{covering}} the cutting and breaking domain divide into four morpho-syntactic classes {{that can be}} ranked according to agentivity. We demonstrate that the highly non-agentive break verbs participate in the causative-inchoative alternation while the highly agentive cut verbs do not, as expected from Guerssel et al. 's (1985) hypothesis. However, four verbs tso 'cut with precision', 'cut', 'snap-off', and dze 'split', are used transitively when an instrument {{is required for the}} <b>severance</b> to be <b>effected,</b> and intransitively when not. We reject a lexicalist analysis that would postulate polysemy for these verbs and argue for a construction approach...|$|R
40|$|The main {{scientific}} bibliography {{addressing the}} rationale behind ecological compensation is reviewed {{in order to examine}} general guidelines. This contains interesting general guidance on how to implement compensation, and provides the basis for future developments in compensation practice. On this basis, we propose a further step in compensation practice, advancing compensation proposals or rules for specific kinds of projects and contexts, focusing on road projects in the Spanish Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Three main residual impacts of roads are identified which usually remain uncompensated for: the loss of natural and semi-natural land use, the increase in emissions resulting from any new road, and the fragmentation, <b>severance</b> or barrier <b>effect</b> on the landscape and its wildlife. To counteract these, four proposals, or “rules”, are advanced: conservation of natural and semi-natural land use area, conservation of dominant plant species physiognomy, compensation for emissions, and the rule of positive defragmentation...|$|R
40|$|West Germany's Employment Promotion Act of 1985 {{facilitated}} {{the use of}} fixed term contracts and {{increased the number of}} dismissals above which the employer is required to establish a 'social plan' (involving <b>severance</b> payments). The <b>effect</b> of this reduction in 'firing costs' on movements in employment is assessed using manufacturing data by detailed industry for the period 1977 - 1992 : a dynamic specification using the data as a panel, and allowing coefficients to vary by industry (random coefficients) is employed. Compared to the 1977 - 1981 period, adjustment of blue collar hours was more flexible from 1982 - 1988, and less flexible in the subsequent period. There is weaker evidence that adjustment of blue collar workers became less flexible in the years following the new legislation and that white collar workers' flexibility fluctuated over the period examined. The timing and direction of these changes, as well as the direction of relative changes in flexibility between industries with high and low sales variability, suggest they are not the result of the Employment Promotion Act. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Increasing people's {{mobility}} {{can improve}} access to diverse opportunities, but new roads {{are associated with}} noise and community <b>severance,</b> and their <b>effects</b> on physical activity, injuries, and health inequalities are poorly understood. This study investigated how an urban motorway, opened in Glasgow in 2011, affected travel and activity patterns, injuries, and wellbeing in local communities, and how these impacts were experienced and brought about. Methods: This was a mixed-method, controlled, before and after natural experimental study. We conducted multivariable cohort, cross-sectional, and repeat cross-sectional analyses of survey responses from adults resident in the M 74 corridor (intervention area) and two matched control areas, one surrounding the existing M 8 motorway and one with no motorway (numbers by area: baseline [in 2005] 449, 431, 465, respectively; follow-up [in 2013] 430, 446, 467; cohort participants 126, 112, 127). We also conducted interrupted time-series analyses of police casualty data (STATS 19 forms, 1997 – 2014; n= 78   919), and thematic analysis of ethnographic data from 42 participants using constant comparison. Graded exposure measures based on the log distance of the motorway from each participant's home served as a further basis for controlled comparisons. The study {{was approved by the}} University of Glasgow Faculty of Medicine (ref FM 01304) and Social Sciences (refs 400120077, 400130156, and 400130157) ethics committees. Findings: Living closer to the new motorway was associated with an estimated 3 · 6 unit (95...|$|R
5000|$|Severance {{in equity}} can be {{achieved}} in five main ways. Firstly, the most certain way to sever is to serve a statutory notice under Law of Property Act 1925 section 36 on the other joint tenants [...] "a notice in writing of such desire" [...] to sever one's share. Some courts have construed this provision restrictively, so in Harris v Goddard the Court of Appeal held that because Mrs Harris in her divorce petition requested merely that [...] "such order be made... in respect of the former matrimonial home", and did not request that an order be made immediately, she had not yet severed her share. This meant that when Mr Harris unexpectedly died after a car crash, {{she was able to}} remain a joint tenant and inherit the whole home, and the children of Mr Harris' first marriage did not. A notice will be considered effective, or [...] "served" [...] under Law of Property Act 1925 section 196 when it is left at a person's home or office, or if posted and so long as it does not go undelivered (in contrast to the postal rule) when it would ordinarily arrive. In Kinch v Bullard Mrs Johnson was terminally ill, and wished to sever her share of the home and sent a letter, but when she realised that Mr Johnson was ill too and would die first, she wanted to cancel her severance notice. Neuberger J held that because the letter was already delivered to Mr Johnson's house, it could not be withdrawn, even though Mr Johnson had not yet read it. Second, and in contrast to the formalistic approach for section 36, it was held in Burgess v Rawnsley that a course of dealings between two people can manifest the intention to sever. Mr Burgess had discussed with Ms Rawnsley selling her share in a property for £750 but negotiations stalled when she asked for more, and then he unexpectedly died. [...] "'Even if there was not any firm agreement but only a course of dealing", said Lord Denning MR, [...] "it clearly evinced an intention by both parties that the property should henceforth be held in common and not jointly." [...] Third, simply making an agreement to sell one's share will be counted by the courts as severing. Fourth, the declaration of bankruptcy <b>effects</b> <b>severance,</b> as under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 306, a bankrupt's estate will vest immediately in the trustee in bankruptcy. Fifth, killing a joint tenant will sever a share, because the Forfeiture Act 1982 generally prevents a killer to benefit from his wrong. However, in Re K the Court of Appeal upheld a claim by a lady to be relieved from forfeiture using a discretion in section 2. Mrs K had shot and killed her husband, but only after prolonged domestic violence, and she had been cleared of murder because it did not count as intentional. Lastly, if practical, beneficial owners may request trustees to physically partition property under Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 section 7, and compensate the different owners in money as is appropriate.|$|R
