5000|$|Nonetheless, it is {{sometimes}} <b>said</b> in Greece <b>today</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman authorities prohibited education in the languages of non-Muslim subject peoples, obliging Greeks to organize small, secret schools in monasteries and churches. Supposed sites of such secret schools are today shown in many places in Greece, notably at the Philosophou Monastery in Dimitsana. These schools are often credited, specially by the Greek Church, with having played a decisive role in keeping Greek language and literacy alive through the period of Turkish rule. An early claim of repressed education of Greeks is found in a speech of Konstantinos Oikonomou, in 1821. He says that schools in Ottoman Empire operated under the pretext of teaching religion and commerce, {{some of them were}} kept open through bribing influential Turks, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> official school of Smyrna was persecuted because it taught mathematics and philosophy. In 1823, Greek scholar Michel Schinas describes the obstacles imposed to Greek schools by local Ottoman authorities.
