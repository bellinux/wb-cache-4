Miss Rosa is told that she needs an operation to improve her chances of survival. However the DOC refuse to fund the operation and she is told {{that she needs to}} keep having chemotherapy. The outcome of which means she is likely to die. She then reminisces about her past as bank robber in which all the men she kissed during heists ended up dead. She details her life to a fellow cancer patient Yusef and they bond. He decides to help her regain the adrenaline rush felt from robbery and they steal a nurse's purse. Miss Rosa is delighted to learn that Yusef has gone into remission but is <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye. She returns to her cell and informs good friend Anita DeMarco (Lin Tucci) that she is dying before smelling the money she stole from the nurse.|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, {{speculation}} arose {{that group}} member Amelle Berrabah {{had left the}} Sugababes following reports of tension with band member Keisha Buchanan. However, it was announced on 21 September 2009 that Buchanan, the sole original member of the group, had officially left the Sugababes. Buchanan clarified the departure on her official Twitter account, writing: [...] "I'm <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I am no longer {{a part of the}} Sugababes ... Although it was not my choice to leave, it's time to enter a new chapter in my life ... Sometimes a breakdown in communication and lack of trust can result in many different things." [...] Buchanan was replaced by former Eurovision contestant Jade Ewen. As a result of the line-up change, [...] "Wear My Kiss" [...] was re-recorded for the inclusion of vocals from new member Ewen and the removal of vocals from Buchanan.|$|E
500|$|Manson {{recorded}} his vocals at his Hollywood Hills home studio between November 2008 and his January 5, 2009 birthday. He described the album as containing [...] "extreme" [...] autobiographical content {{relating to the}} dissolution of both his marriage to burlesque artist Dita Von Teese, and his later relationship with then-19-year old actress Evan Rachel Wood, explaining: [...] "Some of the things I say here, it's <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> them—they're relationship-destroying statements. Some of it is stuff I should have said to my ex-wife. Some are things I've never said to the world." [...] Manson used his home as a canvas to document the disintegration {{of his relationship with}} Wood, writing the album's lyrics on walls and coupling them with paintings and drawings, as well as used condoms, bags of cocaine and other drug paraphernalia. Much of the album's artwork was shot there.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the less}} {{favorable}} contemporary critiques, a Melody Maker reviewer dismissed the album as [...] "Not typical Byrds music, which is rather a pity." [...] Writing in Crawdaddy! {{just before he}} withdrew from city life and temporarily retired from music journalism, Paul Williams lamented: [...] "I'm beginning to think I'll have to make this jailbreak unaided … The Byrds have gone country and Big Pink is out, and it's beautiful stuff, man, beautiful … But country is just more relaxation, wonderful stifling inertia … and I guess this isn't the summer to look to be rescued by music." [...] Robert Shelton of The New York Times similarly commented that [...] "The latest Byrds album adheres {{to most of the}} 'rules of the game' about country sound, and yet, <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> to this old fan of the Byrds, the album is a distinguished bore." ...|$|E
500|$|Initial {{sales of}} the album were strong but dropped off disappointingly as {{contemporary}} reviews of the album were mixed. Critic Ira Robbins wrote [...] "although this casual loud-rock outing... seems on first blush to be slapdash and slight, the first side is actually quite good, offering provocative pop-culture lyrics delivered with first-take enthusiasm and carefree backing." [...] In 1987, Spin magazine called the album [...] "an inspired and brilliantly crafted work. It's charged with a positive spirit that makes art soul food; imbued with the contagious energy that gives ideas a leg to dance on", but in 1989 a different reviewer for the magazine called the album [...] "disappointing". Rolling Stone magazine called the work an [...] "odd, freewheeling pastiche of elements from all the previous Bowies," [...] "unfocused," [...] and possibly [...] "the noisiest, sloppiest Bowie album ever. ... Being noisy and sloppy isn't necessarily a bad thing, but <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> Never Let Me Down is also something of a mess." [...] Another critic held a general optimism for {{the potential of the}} songs on the album, complaining only that the [...] "oppressive production" [...] ruined the songs. Billboard magazine's 1987 retrospective issue called Never Let Me Down [...] "arguably the year's most underrated release" [...] and considered the album a [...] "Critic's Choice" [...] for the year.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversial}} single [...] "Welcome to the Terrordome" [...] references {{the murder}} of Yusef Hawkins and the 1989 riots in Virginia Beach, and it has Chuck D criticizing Jewish leaders who protested Public Enemy in response to Professor Griff's anti-Semitic remarks. He addresses the controversy as being {{in the center of}} political turmoil, with criticisms of the media and references to the Crucifixion of Jesus: [...] "Crucifixion ain't no fiction / So called chosen frozen / Apology made to who ever pleases / Still they got me like Jesus". He is also critical of Blacks and those who [...] "blame somebody else when you destroy yourself": [...] "Every brother ain't a brother / 'cause a Black hand squeezed on Malcolm X the man / the shootin of Huey Newton / from the hand of Nig who pulled the trigger". His lyricism features dizzying raps and internal rhyme: [...] "Lazer, anastasia, maze ya / Ways to blaze your brain and train ya [...] <b>Sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I got sold down the river / Still some quiver when I deliver / Never to say I never knew or had a clue / Word was heard, plus hard on the boulevard / Lies, scandalizin', basin' / Traits of hate who's celebratin' wit Satan?". Its dense production incorporates numerous samples, including several James Brown tracks and the guitar line from The Temptations' [...] "Psychedelic Shack". Several other samples are heard amid Chuck D's rapping, such as the line [...] "come on, you can get it-get it-get it" [...] from Instant Funk's [...] "I Got My Mind Made Up (You Can Get It Girl)". AllMusic's John Bush cites the track as [...] "the production peak of the Bomb Squad and one of Chuck D.'s best rapping performances ever ... one of their tracks were more musically incendiary".|$|E

But it is, <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> not a very entertaining movie; it's a long slog unless you're fascinated by the undercurrents." [...] In a primarily negative review, Lisa Schwarzbaum writing for Entertainment Weekly, called the film [...] "an oddly unengaging one, {{not because of any}} weak performances (even crooning poetess Jewel acquits herself pleasantly in her film debut), but because the waxy yellow buildup of earnest tastefulness (the curse of the Burns school of history) seals off every character from our access." [...] Describing a favorable opinion, Russell Smith of The Austin Chronicle professed the film as exhibiting [...] "unostentatious originality, psychological insight, and stark beauty". While following up, he stressed [...] "There's an odd blend of stylization and extreme realism to this film. The dialogue is stilted, full of archaic $20-words and dime-novel flamboyance — all the more jarring when delivered by these teenaged bumpkin characters." ...|$|E

6000|$|Our {{readers may}} wonder at {{not seeing the}} Ettrick Shepherd's poems among the list {{at the head of}} the article. It seems to us, however, that we have done right in omitting them. Doubtless, he too was awakened into song by the example of Burns; but he seems to us to owe little to his great predecessor, beyond the general {{consciousness}} that there was a virgin field of poetry in Scotch scenery, manners, and legends--a debt which Walter Scott himself probably owed to the Ayrshire peasant just as much as Hogg did. Indeed, we perhaps are right in saying, that had Burns not lived, neither Wilson, Galt, Allan Cunningham, or the crowd of lesser writers who have found material for their fancy in Scotch peculiarities, would have written, as they have. The three first names, Wilson's above all, must have been in any case distinguished; yet it is surely no derogation to some of the most exquisite rural sketches in [...] "Christopher North's Recreations," [...] to claim them as the intellectual foster-children of [...] "The Cottar's Saturday Night." [...] In this respect, certainly, the Ettrick Shepherd has a place in Burns's school, and, in our own opinion, one which has been very much overrated. But the deeper elements of Burns's mind, those which have especially endeared him to the working man, reappear very little, or not at all, in Hogg. He left his class too much below him; became too much of the mere aesthetic prodigy, and member of a literary clique; frittered away his great talents in brilliant talk and insincere Jacobite songs, and, in fine, worked no deliverance on the earth. It is <b>sad</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this: but we had it forced upon us painfully enough a few days ago, when re-reading [...] "Kilmeny." [...] There may be beautiful passages in it; but it is not coherent, not natural, not honest. It is throughout an affectation of the Manichaean sentimental-sublime, which God never yet put into the heart of any brawny, long-headed, practical Borderer, and which he therefore probably put into his own head, or, as we call it, affected, for the time being; a method of poetry writing which comes forth out of nothing, and into nothing must return.|$|R
