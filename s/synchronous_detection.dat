Thus {{there is a great}} advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier, either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband (single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission) or with both sidebands remaining (double sideband suppressed carrier). While these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power, they require more sophisticated receivers employing <b>synchronous</b> <b>detection</b> and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using envelope detection. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed lower sideband, includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} channel tracking and equalization for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) time-variant frequencyselective channels. These channels model the corrupting effects of intersymbol interference (ISI), co-channel interference (CCI), and noise. A firstorder autoregressive model describes the MIMO channel variation, and tracking is performed by a Kalman filter. Hard decisions to aid Kalman tracking come from a MIMO finite-length minimum-mean-squared-error decision-feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE), which performs the equalization task. Since the optimum DFE {{for a wide range}} of channels produces decisions with a delay Δ ? 0, the Kalman filter tracks the channel with a delay. A channel prediction module bridges the time gap between the channel estimates produced by the Kalman filter and those needed for the DFE adaptation. The proposed algorithm offers good tracking behavior for multi-user fading ISI channels at the expense of higher complexity than conventional adaptive algorithms. Appropriate coding options for this system are also discussed.
