5000|$|The <b>seminal</b> <b>{{colliculus}}</b> (Latin colliculus seminalis), or verumontanum, of the prostatic urethra is {{a landmark}} {{near the entrance}} of the ejaculatory ducts (on both sides, corresponding vas deferens and seminal vesicle feed into corresponding ejaculatory duct). Verumontanum is translated from Latin to mean 'mountain ridge', a reference to the distinctive median elevation of urothelium that characterizes the landmark on magnified views. Embryologically, it is derived from the uterovaginal primordium. The landmark is important in classification of several urethral developmental disorders. The margins of <b>seminal</b> <b>colliculus</b> are the following: ...|$|E
5000|$|The prostatic utricle (Latin for [...] "pouch of the prostate") {{is a small}} {{indentation}} in the prostatic urethra, at {{the apex}} of the urethral crest, on the <b>seminal</b> <b>colliculus</b> (verumontanum), laterally flanked by openings of the ejaculatory ducts. It is also known as the vagina masculina or (in older literature) vesicula prostatica.|$|E
50|$|The {{ejaculatory}} ducts (ductus ejaculatorii) are paired {{structures in}} male anatomy. Each ejaculatory duct is {{formed by the}} union of the vas deferens with the duct of the seminal vesicle. They pass through the prostate, and open into the urethra at the <b>seminal</b> <b>colliculus.</b> During ejaculation, semen passes through the prostate gland, enters the urethra and exits the body via the urinary meatus.|$|E
50|$|AMH is a {{glycoprotein}} hormone that is secreted by sustentacular cells (Sertoli cells) in males {{as they begin}} their morphologic differentiation in response to SRY expression. AMH begins to be secreted around week 8, which in turn causes the paramesonephric ducts to regress very rapidly between the 8th and 10th weeks. However, small paramesonephric ducts can still be identified, and the remnants can be detected in the adult male, located in the appendix testis, a small cap of tissue associated with the testis. Remnants of the paramesonephric ducts {{can also be found}} in the prostatic utricle, an expansion of the prostatic urethra {{at the center of the}} <b>seminal</b> <b>colliculus.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Human vestigial {{structures}} {{also include}} leftover embryological remnants that once served a function during development, {{such as the}} belly button, and analogous structures between biological sexes. For example, men are also born with two nipples, which are not known to serve a function compared to women [...] In regards to genitourinary development, {{both internal and external}} genitalia of male and female fetuses have the ability to fully or partially form their analogous phenotype of the opposite biological sex if exposed to a lack/overabundance of androgens or the SRY gene during fetal development. Examples of vestigial remnants of genitourinary development include the hymen, which is a membrane that surrounds or partially covers the external vaginal opening that derives from the sinus tubercle during fetal development and is homologous to the male <b>seminal</b> <b>colliculus.</b> Some researchers have hypothesized that the persistence of the hymen may be to provide temporary protection from infection, as it separates the vaginal lumen from the urogenital sinus cavity during development. Other examples include the glans penis and the clitoris, the labia minora and the ventral penis, and the ovarian follicles and the seminiferous tubules.|$|E
40|$|A 7 -year-old boy was {{admitted}} for recurrent pyelonephritis. Intravenous pyelography IVP showed right hydronephrosis and normal left kidney and ureter. Cystourethroscopy revealed no ureteral orifices in the bladder but bilateral ureteral openings {{adjacent to the}} <b>seminal</b> <b>colliculus.</b> Right retrograde pyelography showed severe hydroureter and hydronephrosis. The diagnosis was bilateral ectopic ureteral opening into proximal urethra. His abnormality of ureteral opening was classified as type II in Thom's classification. Bilateral ureterocystoneostomy was performed. Only 3 cases of bilateral ectopic ureter in males {{have been reported in}} the Japanese literature...|$|E
40|$|Reports {{were made}} of {{experiences}} with a new co n trast agent, Umbradil and Umbradil Viscous U of Messrs, Astra, Sweden. 1) Excretory pyelography was carried out using Umbradil 35 % in 7, 50 % in 8, and 70 % in 2 cases, totaling 17 cases. Satisfactory pictures were obtained in all cases within 7 to 15 minutes after initiatation of the injection. Urograms were taken without urete r al compression in 5 patients, which procedures generally resulted in an insufficient filling of the agent and afforded unclear shadows, as compared with those cases where an ureteral compresser band was used. Then the shadows obtained were found unclear in 2 cases where a 70 % Umbradil was employed, too. Side reactions were slight, only a transient nausea and feverish sensation being experienced in 2 patients, respectively. 2) Umbradil 70 % w a s employed for translumbar abdominal aortography in 10 cases and for seriography in 3 of the 10 cases. With both procedures were obtained quite satisfactory arteriogram. sIn 1 patient with Goldblatt's hypertension a sense of oppression of the chest was induced and in 1 patient was encountered an incidence of nausea, but no side reactions other than the above were produced. 3) Umbradil 70 % was used for abdominal venography via femo ral vein in 2 cases. 4) Umbradil Viscous U was used for urethrography in 21 male patients. In al l cases, the posterior urethra was conspicuously distended, the region of <b>seminal</b> <b>colliculus</b> and the neck of bladder being clearly represented. There was a marked difference in the pictu r es obtai ned between Umbradil Viscous U and NaI 20 % employed as the control, namely the former being of satisfaction as a urethrographic contrast medium {{in that it is}} highly viscous and non-irritating. 5) Umbradil Viscous U was employed for urethrography in 11 female patients, the picture of urethral diverticulum being given in 3 of the 11 patients. It is therf ore satisfactory as a medium for urethrography in the female, too...|$|E
