It is south of the average path of storms originating in the higher latitudes, and north of the usual tracks of hurricanes and other major tropical storms, with the exception of Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Because of the moderating effects of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Virginia Beach is the northernmost location on the east coast in which many species of plants (both subtropical and tropical) will reliably grow. <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss,</b> for example is near the northernmost limit of its natural range at First Landing State Park, and is the most northerly location where it is widespread. Other plants like Sabal palmetto, Pindo Palm, Windmill Palm, Hardy Citrus, and Oleander are successfully grown here while they succumb to the colder winter temperatures to the north and inland to the west.|$|E

25|$|This species {{typically}} inhabits wooded areas near permanent {{water sources}} or coastal habitats with <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss</b> (Tillandsia usneoides) or palm trees. In the southeastern United States, L. intermedius distribution almost always coincides with <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss,</b> which they use for both roost and maternity sites. Bats roost within the <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss</b> itself or beneath the dead hanging fronds of fan palm trees. A single palm tree or live oak tree draped in <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss</b> may {{be home to}} several individuals year-round, and multiple pregnant and lactating females may form a maternity colony, despite the solitary nature of most Lasiurine bats. One study found bats favored Sand live oaks (Quercus geminata) with an average roost height of 2.23 m above the ground and 1.57 m above the nearest vegetation. The average length of a roost was 0.98 m and average width was 0.44 m. Clumps of <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss</b> used for roosting sites were 2-3 times larger than clumps of un-used <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss</b> in the area. All roosts were within 1 m of the sandy road and less than 11 m from a lake. These bats frequently changed their roost site. In August 2003, a male northern yellow bat was found roosting {{on the underside of}} a partially dead frond of cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto) along the edge of Lake August in a residential lawn in Florida. The cryptic coloration of this species makes it difficult to spot on the brown frond of a palm.|$|E

25|$|Gopher {{tortoises}} are herbivore scavengers. Their diets contains over 300 {{species of}} plants. They consume {{a very wide}} range of plants, but mainly eat broad-leaved grass, regular grass, wiregrass, and terrestrial legumes. They also eat mushrooms, and fruits such as gopher apple, pawpaw, blackberries, and saw palmetto berries. In addition, gopher tortoises eat flowers from the genera Cnidoscolus (nettles), Tillandsia (<b>Spanish</b> and ball <b>moss),</b> Richardia, and Dyschoriste. Juvenile tortoises tend to eat more legumes, which are higher in protein, and fewer grasses and tough, fibrous plants than mature tortoises. Gopher tortoises {{have been known to}} scavenge carrion and eat excrement. As gopher tortoises usually get water from the food they eat, they usually only drink standing water in times of extreme drought.|$|R

25|$|While many {{worked on}} the {{sugarcane}} plantations in the 19th century, duck hunting, gathering <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss,</b> horticulture, cattle breeding and carpentry were other occupations. Between 1800 and 1900 an important commerce developed in seafood and fish caught by Isleños fishermen and sold to New Orleans restaurants. In 1820, many Isleño farmers abandoned agriculture and settled in the eastern basin of Saint Bernard where a fishing community grew in Delacroix Island. There was a large trade in shrimp, fish and crabs that were sold in New Orleans.|$|E
25|$|At first, {{the evening}} bat was {{thought of as}} a southeastern bat species. However, {{breeding}} evening bats have been found as far north as Michigan and as far west as the 100th meridian. Evening bats roost in a variety of structures, including <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss,</b> under bark, in tree cavities, and in buildings. For foraging habitat, evening bats in Georgia prefer pine forest, riparian zones, and open fields. Evening bats have home ranges of approximately 300 hectare (1.15mi2). Because the evening bat is not found in the northernmost extent of its range in the winter, it is likely that at least some evening bats are migratory.|$|E
25|$|Buildings were {{constructed}} using both poteaux-en-terre and poteaux-sur-sole techniques. In poteaux-en-terre construction, wooden posts are placed vertically into the ground. The gaps remaining between the posts {{were filled with}} a mixture of mud or clay and <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss</b> or hay. The mixture can be supplemented with small rocks. The walls are bound by a top plate and protected with plaster or siding. In poteaux-sur-sole construction, the floor of the building is elevated {{through the use of a}} bottom sill. The sill was formed by laying the wooden members directly on the ground. The elevation of the floor provided an airspace that minimized damage from moisture and insects. Since the conditions of the site were damaging against wooden structures, the poteaux-sur-sole structures would have been advantageous since their sill members could be more easily replaced than the wooden posts of a poteaux-en-terre structure. Exterior trenches suggest that palisade fences were used around some of the buildings.|$|E
25|$|Clancy Lyall {{was born}} in Orange, Texas. His father, Arthur Edward Lyall, who worked on ships {{transporting}} oil from the United States to Scotland, was a Scot. His mother, Beulah, was a full-blooded Cherokee Indian from Oklahoma. His father met his mother {{on a trip to}} the US after wanting to see the native peoples in Oklahoma. They married and Beulah eventually moved to Orange Texas to set up a farm. Clancy was raised for a time with his maternal Grandfather on the reservation while the farm was being built. Once the farm was completed Clancy attended a one-room school and worked on his parents' 120 acre farm in Orange until they moved to Pennsylvania in 1939. In the summers he would also cross the Sabine river to work in Louisiana, earning some money by picking <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss</b> for use as mattress batting. The skills he learned from the Cajuns in how to survive in the swamps would prove useful in his later military career as did the hunting and tracking skills taught to him by his Cherokee grandfather. Clancy also hunted cougar to bring in extra money for the family.|$|E
500|$|Cypress {{trees are}} {{conifers}} that are adapted {{to live in}} standing fresh water. They grow in compact structures called cypress domes and in long strands over limestone. Water levels may fluctuate dramatically around cypress domes and strands, so cypresses develop [...] "knees" [...] that protrude from the water at high levels to provide oxygen for the root systems. Dwarf cypress trees grow in drier areas with poorer soil. Epiphytes, such as bromeliads, <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss</b> (Tillandsia usneoides), orchids and ferns grow on the branches and trunks of cypress trees. Everglades National Park features twenty-five species of orchids. Tall cypress trees provide excellent nesting areas for birds including wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), ibis, herons, egrets, anhingas (Anhinga anhinga), and belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon). Mammals in cypress regions include white-tailed deer, squirrels, raccoons, opossums, skunks, swamp rabbits, river otters (Lontra canadensis), and bobcats, as well as small rodents.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{took place}} on the San Joaquin River Delta. The set, imitating a {{southern}} prison farm, was built in Stockton, California. The filmmakers sent a crew to Tavares Road Prison in Tavares, Florida to take photographs and measurements, where Pearce had served his time. The structures that were built in Stockton included [...] barracks, a mess hall, the warden's quarters, a guard shack and dog kennels. The trees on the set were decorated with <b>spanish</b> <b>moss</b> that the producers took to the area. The construction soon attracted the attention of a county building inspector who confused it with migrant worker housing and ordered it [...] "condemned for code violations." [...] The opening scene where Newman cuts the parking meters [...] was filmed in Lodi, California. Meanwhile, the scene in which Luke is chased by bloodhounds and other exteriors were shot in Jacksonville, Florida, at Callahan Road Prison. Luke was played by a stunt actor, using dogs from the Florida Department of Corrections.|$|E

2500|$|The Calusa wore little clothing. The men wore a deerskin breechcloth. The Spanish left less {{description}} on {{what the}} Calusa women wore. [...] Among most tribes in Florida {{for which there is}} documentation, the women wore skirts made of what was later called <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss.</b> The Calusa painted their bodies on a regular basis, but there was no report of tattooing among them. The men wore their hair long. [...] The missionaries recognized that having a Calusa man cut his hair upon converting to Christianity (and European style) would be a great sacrifice. Little was recorded of jewelry or other ornamentation among the Calusa. [...] During Menéndez de Avilés's visit in 1566, the chief's wife was described as wearing pearls, precious stones and gold beads around her neck. The heir of the chief wore gold in an ornament on his forehead and beads on his legs.|$|E
2500|$|Ceramics {{are often}} used to {{identify}} archaeological cultures. The type of temper (or mix of tempers) used helps to distinguish the ceramics produced by different cultures during particular time periods. Grog, sand, and sandstone were all used by Ancestral Pueblo people and other Southwestern cultures. Crushed bone was used as temper {{in at least some}} ceramics at a number of sites in Texas. In the Southeastern United States, the earliest ceramics were tempered with fiber such as <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss</b> and palmetto leaves. In Louisiana, fiber as tempering was replaced first by grog and later by shell. In peninsular Florida and coastal Georgia sand replaced fiber as tempering. Still later, freshwater sponge spicules became an important temper in the [...] "chalky ware" [...] of the St. Johns culture in northeastern Florida. Locally produced ceramics of the Lucayan people in the Bahamas were characterized by crushed conch shell tempering, as opposed to the quartz sand-tempered ware imported from Hispaniola.|$|E
2500|$|Harvest mites {{are found}} {{throughout}} the world. In Europe and North America, {{they tend to be}} more prevalent in the hot and humid parts. In the more temperate regions, they are found only in the summer (in French, harvest mites are called aoûtat, after août, August; vendangeon, after vendange, harvest; or rouget, after rouge, red). In the United States, they are found mostly in the southeast, the south, and the Midwest. They are not present, or barely found, in far northern areas, high mountains, or deserts. They live in forests and grasslands, and are also found in low, damp areas where vegetation is rank, such as woodlands, berry patches, orchards, along lakes and streams, and even in drier places where vegetation is low, such as lawns, golf courses, and parks. They are most numerous in early summer, when grass, weeds, and other vegetation are most prevalent. [...] Harvest mites can also find their way into homes, and onto human hosts, on decorative <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On May 3, 1901, {{downtown}} Jacksonville was {{ravaged by}} {{a fire that}} started as a kitchen fire. <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss</b> at a nearby mattress factory was quickly engulfed in flames and enabled the fire to spread rapidly. In just eight hours, it swept through 146 city blocks, destroyed over 2,000 buildings, left about 10,000 homeless and killed seven residents. [...] The Confederate Monument in Hemming Park {{was one of the}} few landmarks to survive the fire. Governor William Sherman Jennings declared martial law and sent the state militia to maintain order; on May 17, municipal authority resumed. It is said the glow from the flames could be seen in Savannah, Georgia, and the smoke plumes seen in Raleigh, North Carolina. Known as the [...] "Great Fire of 1901", it was one of the worst disasters in Florida history and the largest urban fire in the southeastern United States. Architect Henry John Klutho was a primary figure in the reconstruction of the city. The first multi-story structure built by Klutho was the Dyal-Upchurch Building in 1902. The St. James Building, built on the previous site of the St. James Hotel that burned down, was built in 1912 as Klutho's crowning achievement.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Frazier's father bought {{a black and}} white television. The family and others nearby came to watch boxing matches on it. Frazier's mother sold drinks for a quarter as they watched boxers like Sugar Ray Robinson, Rocky Marciano, Willie Pep and Rocky Graziano. One night Frazier's Uncle Israel noticed his stocky build. [...] "That boy there...that boy is gonna be another Joe Louis" [...] he remarked. The words made an {{impression}} on Joe. His classmates at school would give him a sandwich or a quarter to walk with them at final bell so that bullies would not bother them. Frazier said, [...] "Any 'scamboogah' (a disrespectful, low-down and foul person) who got in my face would soon regret it; Billie Boy could kick anybody's ass." [...] The day after his Uncle's comment, Frazier filled old burlap sack with rags, corncobs, a brick, and <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss.</b> He hung the makeshift heavybag from an oak tree in the backyard. [...] "For the next 6, 7 years, damn near every day I'd hit that heavybag for an hour at a time. I'd wrap my hands with a necktie of my Daddy's, or a stocking of my Momma's or sister's, and get to it" [...] Joe remarked.|$|E
2500|$|Mollusk {{shells and}} wood {{were used to}} make {{hammering}} and pounding tools. Mollusks shells and shark teeth were used for grating, cutting, carving and engraving. The Calusa wove nets from palm-fiber cord. Cord was also made from Cabbage Palm leaves, saw palmetto trunks, <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss,</b> false sisal (Agave decipiens) and the bark of cypress and willow trees. The Calusa also made fish traps, weirs, and fish corrals from wood and cord. Artifacts of wood {{that have been found}} include bowls, ear ornaments, masks, plaques, [...] "ornamental standards," [...] and a finely carved deer head. The plaques and other objects were often painted. To date no one has found a Calusa dugout canoe, but it is speculated that such vessels would have been constructed from the same trees used by other Florida Indian people- cypress and pine. [...] The process of shaping the boat was achieved by burning the middle and subsequently chopping and removing the charred center, using robust shell tools. (In 1954 a dugout canoe was found during excavation for a middle school in Marathon, Florida. It was not conserved and is in poor shape, but it is displayed at the nature center in Marathon. It has been speculatively identified as Calusa in origin.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In North America, {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas captured shrimp and other crustaceans in fishing weirs and traps made from branches and <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss,</b> or used nets woven with fibre beaten from plants. At the same time early European settlers, oblivious to the [...] "protein-rich coasts" [...] all about them, starved from lack of protein. In 1735 beach seines were imported from France, and Cajun fishermen in Louisiana started catching white shrimp and drying them in the sun, as they still do today. In the mid nineteenth century, Chinese immigrants arrived for the California Gold Rush, many from the Pearl River Delta where netting small shrimp had been a tradition for centuries. Some immigrants starting catching shrimp local to San Francisco Bay, particularly the small inch long Crangon franciscorum. These shrimp burrow into the sand to hide, and can be present in high numbers without appearing to be so. The catch was dried {{in the sun and}} was exported to China or sold to the Chinese community in the United States. This {{was the beginning of the}} American shrimping industry. Overfishing and pollution from gold mine tailings resulted in the decline of the fishery. It was replaced by a penaeid white shrimp fishery on the South Atlantic and Gulf coasts. These shrimp were so abundant that beaches were piled with windrows from their moults. Modern industrial shrimping methods originated in this area.|$|E
2500|$|Florida {{was mostly}} divided between two {{distinct}} culture groups, the Muskogean & the Carib. While {{there were some}} Muskogean tribes along almost the entirety of Florida's east coast, everything else south of Lake Okeechobee was ruled by a Carib nation called the Calusa —Including the Keys. This tribe {{appears to have been}} a powerful trading force in the Caribbean & the chief & his wife were treated almost as if they were a king & queen. They had discovered complex building techniques & built cities of two story communal buildings, as space within the Everglades was scarce. Smaller farming & fishing villages built the more common thatched-roof, stilted huts common amongst the Carib peoples. While they mostly wove their clothing from <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss</b> & made shawls & rugs from dried palm leaves, they also undoubtedly traded for other cloth goods to the north and west, which may have given them access to Hemp [...] & Cotton. The Chief & his wife had their own palace, of sorts, in which they lived & from which they conducted their political business. They were met with the Spanish when they attempted to explore Florida in the 16th century & continued to survive in the region until the mid-18th century, when Spain temporarily lost control of the Florida colony to the English due to the activities of the Creek Confederacy. They were also partially responsible for the mythology surrounding the Fountain of Youth. Later, they conquered some of the other Muskogean peoples—namely the Ais & the Mayaimi [...] (for which the city of Miami is named for, despite the fact that the tribe surrounded Lake Okeechobee), technically making them an Empire, as small as they were. (An Empire is seen as a governing system in which significant populations of different kinds of people with separate cultural identities are ruled over by a single, ultimate ruler).|$|E

The sunset fires, refracted from the cloud-driftage of the autumn sky, bathed the canyon with crimson, in which ruddy-limbed madronos and wine-wooded manzanitas burned and smoldered. The air was aromatic with laurel. Wild grape vines bridged the stream from tree to tree. Oaks of many sorts were veiled in lacy <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss.</b> Ferns and brakes grew lush beside the stream. From somewhere came the plaint of a mourning dove. Fifty feet above the ground, almost over their heads, a Douglas squirrel crossed the road--a flash of gray between two trees; and they marked the continuance of its aerial passage by the bending of the boughs.|$|E

It is navigable to this point--that is to say, to Pittsburg Landing, where Corinth got to it by a road worn through a thickly wooded country seamed with ravines and bayous, rising nobody knows where and running into the river under sylvan arches heavily draped with <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss.</b> In some places they were {{obstructed}} by fallen trees.

He followed her obediently to the battle field of New Orleans, and admired as obediently the sunset, when the sky was all silver-green through the magnolias, and the spreading live oaks hung with <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss,</b> and a silver bar lay upon the Father of Waters.

And the forest,--it seemed an impenetrable mystery, a strange tangle of fantastic growths: the live-oak (chene vert), its wide-spreading limbs hung funereally with <b>Spanish</b> <b>moss</b> and twined in the mistletoe's death embrace; the dark cypress swamp with the conelike knees above the yellow back-waters; and here and there grew the bridelike magnolia which we had known in Kentucky, wafting its perfume over the waters, and wondrous flowers and vines and trees with French names that bring back the scene to me even now with a whiff of romance, bois d'arc, lilac, grande volaille (water-lily).
