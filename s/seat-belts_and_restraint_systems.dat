40|$|The {{purpose of}} this small {{business}} innovative research (SBIR) program was to evaluate the feasibility of developing small composite airplanes with improved crashworthiness. A combination of analysis and half scale component tests were used to develop an energy absorbing airframe. Four full scale crash tests were conducted at the NASA Impact Dynamics Research Facility, two on a hard surface and two onto soft soil, replicating earlier NASA tests of production general aviation airplanes. Several seat designs <b>and</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> including both an air bag and load limiting shoulder harnesses were tested. Tests showed that occupant loads were within survivable limits with the improved structural design and the proper combination of seats <b>and</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems.</b> There was no loss of cabin volume during the events. The analysis method developed provided design guidance but time did not allow extending the analysis to soft soil impact. This project demonstrated that survivability improvements are possible with modest weight penalties. The design methods can be readily applied by airplane designers using the examples in this report...|$|R

This report reviews 47 survivable or partly survivable accidents investigated since 1973 by personnel from the Civil Aeromedical Institute.

The greatest damage to the occupiable area is to the forward portion of cockpit/cabin and the occupants have a greater chance of survival if the cockpit/cabin remains reasonably intact.

40|$|A NASA {{program to}} improve {{aircraft}} safety {{is discussed in}} terms of three areas of concentration: unexpected turbulence encounters, fire, and crash impact. To provide warning of clear air turbulence (CAT) so that the pilot can take evasive action, a laser Doppler system is described, which functions by measuring backscatter frequency radiation occurring in aerosols ahead of the aircraft. The system was found able to detect CAT, but at shorter than optimal ranges (10 km as opposed to 32 km).

40|$|The {{vehicle design}} {{environment}} from a crashworthiness and safety perspective {{has become increasingly}} complex in recent years.

The customer introduces further complexity through the addition of Consumer requirements in many markets that will influence a purchasing decision.
