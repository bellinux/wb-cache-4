40|$|Although {{reinforced}} concrete shear wall structures {{are widely used}} in high-rise buildings, the methods {{used to analyze the}} seismic response of such a structure during an earthquake generally have low calculation efficiencies. In this article, the transfer matrix method of multibody systems is first established as a mechanical model of a regular {{reinforced concrete}} shear wall structure with both bifurcated and closed transfer paths to analyze the seismic responses of structures. By separating the <b>shear</b> wall <b>legs,</b> establishing a state vector relationship between the two endpoints of the coupling beams, and combining all state vectors of the inputs or outputs of each <b>shear</b> wall <b>leg,</b> the total transfer between <b>shear</b> wall <b>legs</b> is realized, and the overall transfer equation and overall transfer matrix of a shear wall structure are obtained. Applying the transfer matrix method of multibody systems, a 15 -story shear wall structure is used as an engineering example to analyze seismic responses for frequent and rare earthquakes using MATLAB software. The findings show that the transfer matrix method of multibody systems provides similar results to ANSYS but that the transfer matrix method of multibody systems greatly increases calculation efficiency while maintaining accuracy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSimply {{supported}} steel-concrete composite beams {{are widely}} used in bridge construction. Deflection is the significant parameter for serviceability limit state of bridges. A lot of computational effort is required for finite element analysis of bridges considering flexibility of shear connectors and <b>shear</b> <b>leg</b> effects. Neural network is presented for prediction of deflections, at service load, in simply supported steel-concrete composite bridges incorporating flexibility of shear connectors and shear lag effect. The training, testing and validation data sets for neural network are generated using finite element models. The finite element models have been developed using ABAQUS software. These models have been validated with available experimental results. Closed form solution is also proposed based on the developed neural network. The use of the neural network requires a computational effort almost equal to that required for the simple beam analysis (neglecting flexibility of shear connectors and shear lag effect). The neural network has been validated for number of bridges and the errors {{are found to be}} small. The network/closed form solution can be used for rapid prediction of deflection for everyday design...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Shear</b> <b>legs</b> are a {{lifting device}} {{related to the}} gin pole, derrick and tripod (lifting device).

The U. S. Army Field Manual FM 5-125 gives detailed instruction on how to rig shears.|$|E
50|$|Shearleg derrick {{is similar}} to breast with an {{exception}} that instead of fixed guy wires that secure {{the top of the}} mast, it is secured by multiple reeved guy to permit handling loads at various radii by means of load tackle pulley system suspended from the mast top. In a simpler construction, a shearleg derrick can be assembled from two posts to form A-frame <b>shear</b> <b>legs</b> without any crossbar. The bottom of the legs are set in two holes on the ground spreading them apart. There is a rope to tie the two legs together near the bottom to prevent them from spreading apart further. On the top side, the two legs are connected together by a lashing but with a small spacer block placed between the legs. A sling, which may be made from ropes, is placed around the area that two legs meet to be used to put a tackle pulley system for lifting the load. There are two guy wires, front and rear, to support the <b>shear</b> <b>legs.</b> The rear guy may be reeved to allow adjustment of the angle of the <b>shear</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|E

40|$|High-pressure {{granulite}} terranes {{are important}} {{sources of information}} for understanding deep-crustal architecture and processes related to the evolution and stabilization of continental lithosphere. However, {{one of the most}} critical challenges is to understand how, and on what timescales, large exposures of lowermost continental crust are exhumed to the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface. In the East Lake Athabasca region of the western Canadian Shield, high pressure granulites (∼ 1. 0 + GPa) make up one of the largest exposed deep crustal terranes in the world (3 ̆e 20, 000 km 2). Important insight into the exhumation history of this region come from the study of the kinematics, timing, and metamorphic evolution of a several km-wide, oblique-slip, thrust-sense mylonitic <b>shear</b> zone (<b>Legs</b> Lake <b>shear</b> zone) that forms a major boundary of the high-pressure terrane. The juxtaposition of crustal levels across this structure is more than 20 km. Integrated structural and petrologic analysis of the shear zone and its wallrocks, combined with in situ electron microprobe monazite Th-U-Pb geochronology and U-Pb isotope geochronology, suggest a multi-stage exhumation history for the high-pressure region that occurred over a period of 3 ̆e 100 million years. Similar studies of a second and younger fault zone and of the cross-cutting relationships between the two shear zone systems (with displacements of up to 110 km), provide an explanation for the present-day distribution of high pressure rocks in the region and have important implications for the early growth of this part of Laurentia. ...|$|R

Monroe assigned to the Military Police Battalion stationed at Camp Bucca was killed when he was struck by a vehicle operated by Erinys International while pulling security for the United States convoy which was stopped due to an Iraqi vehicle which flipped over while trying to avoid the convoy in the vicinity of Al Basrah, Iraq. In October 2007, a lawsuit was filed in Houston, Texas by the father of SPC Monroe against the British private security firm Erinys International. In the lawsuit, Monroe's father alleges that his son actually died after he was struck by a vehicle operated by Erinys International. The lawsuit alleges Erinys personnel passed through a checkpoint where they were warned that there were more troops ahead of them but despite the warning proceeded in the dark at a high rate of speed with only parking lights on until they struck Monroe. Monroe was dismounted and standing guard near the 5-ton vehicle he was driving providing security after the convoy he was in stopped to render assistance to an Iraqi who had been involved in a car accident.

40|$|High aerobic {{intensity}} {{interval training}} at 90 - 95 % of maximal heart rate {{is more effective}} than continuous training with low to moderate intensity in improving maximal oxygen uptake in healthy young men. Maximal cardiac stroke volume was improved to a similar extent in high aerobic intensity interval training only. It is concluded that high aerobic intensity endurance training is significantly more effective than isocaloric training at lactate threshold (85 % of maximal heart rate) or 70 % of maximal heart rate, in improving maximal oxygen uptake and cardiac stroke volume. Improvements in maximal oxygen uptake corresponded with changes in stroke volume, indicating a close link between the two. High aerobic intensity interval training at 85 - 95 % of peak heart rate significantly improves peak cardiac stroke volume and resting left ventricular ejection fraction in coronary artery disease patients. High aerobic intensity interval training improves peak cardiac stroke volume and left ventricular ejection fraction in coronary artery disease patients due to increased myocardial contractility and enhanced left ventricular systolic performance. Hyperoxic high aerobic intensity interval training at 85 - 95 % of peak heart rate gave no additional effect over normoxic high aerobic intensity interval training in coronary artery disease patients. Hyperoxic training improves VO 2 peak and peak stroke volume to the same extent as ambient air training in stable coronary artery disease patients with mild to moderate coronary ischemia. As acute hyperoxia did not increase VO 2 peak it is concluded that the coronary artery disease patients showed peripheral oxygen limitations in VO 2 peak both before and after 10 weeks of hyperoxic training. Hyperoxic training may thereby represent no increase in cardiovascular <b>shear</b> stress. Maximal <b>leg</b> press exercise focusing on few repetitions with heavy loads and maximal concentric contractions improves maximal strength, rate of force developments and walking mechanical efficiency in coronary artery disease patients through a minimal exercise effort.

50|$|There {{is little}} or no direct {{evidence}} revealing the construction techniques used by the Stonehenge builders. Over the years, various authors have suggested that supernatural or anachronistic methods were used, usually asserting that the stones were impossible to move otherwise due to their massive size. However, conventional techniques, using Neolithic technology as basic as <b>shear</b> <b>legs,</b> have been demonstrably effective at moving and placing stones of a similar size. How the stones could be transported by a prehistoric people without the aid of the wheel or a pulley system is not known. The most common theory of how prehistoric people moved megaliths has them creating a track of logs on which the large stones were rolled along. Another megalith transport theory involves the use of a type of sleigh running on a track greased with animal fat. Such an experiment with a sleigh carrying a 40-ton slab of stone was successful near Stonehenge in 1995. A dedicated team of more than 100 workers managed to push and pull the slab along the 18 mi journey from Marlborough Downs.

40|$|Block shear is {{a complex}} failure {{mechanism}} in bolted and welded steel components such as gusset plates, webs of coped beams, angles and tees. It presumes a combination of tension rupture and shear yield. Multiple variables affect the block shear capacity and ductility of a connection. This study investigates the effects of bolt pretension, connection eccentricity and friction force transfer {{through a series of}} destructive experiments followed by refined finite element simulation. Clamping forces create a complex triaxial stress field compounded by the stress concentration at the bolt holes. In-plane load eccentricity with respect to the centerline of the connection causes a change in stress/strain distributions due to the addition of a moment. That alters the magnitude of stress/strain demand on both the tension plane and <b>shear</b> <b>legs.</b> Friction between the connected plates also acts as a means of load transfer between the connected parts; however, little is known about its contribution to the ultimate capacity of the connection. Five full scale connections were tested to compare two levels of bolt tension under two level of eccentricity. In addition, one test was performed including a layer of Teflon between the plates to isolate the effect of friction. Effects of pretensioning, eccentricity, and friction were then analyzed by comparing load-displacement responses and strain data. Bilinear curves provided a means to identify changes in the ductility and total energy absorbed by the connection before failure that gives a comprehensive view of the change in the behavior of the connection. A nonlinear finite element model for the five cases was developed using ABAQUS to verify the results of the experiment.

40|$|The Minnesota Department of Transportation has {{typically}} used epoxy-coated, straight-legged stirrups {{anchored in the}} tension zone as transverse reinforcement in prestressed concrete bridge girders. This configuration is readily placed after stressing the prestressing strands. American Concrete Institute (ACI) and American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) specifications require stirrups with bent legs that encompass the longitudinal reinforcement to properly anchor the stirrups. Such a configuration is specified to provide mechanical anchorage to the stirrup, ensuring {{that it will be}} able to develop its yield strength with a short anchorage length to resist shear within the web of the girder. AASHTO specifications for anchoring transverse reinforcement are the same for reinforced and prestressed concrete; however, in the case of prestressed concrete bridge girders, there are a number of differences that serve to enhance the anchorage of the transverse reinforcement, thereby enabling the straight bar detail. These include the precompression in the bottom flange of the girder in regions of web-shear cracking. In addition, the stirrup legs are usually embedded within a bottom flange that contains longitudinal strands outside the stirrups. The increased concrete cover over the stirrups provided by the bottom flange and the resistance to vertical splitting cracks along the legs of the stirrups provided by the longitudinal prestressing reinforcement outside the stirrups help to enhance the straight-legged anchorage in both regions of web-shear cracking and flexure-shear cracking. A two-phase experimental program was conducted to investigate the anchorage of straight-legged, epoxy-coated stirrups, which included bar pullout tests performed on 13 subassemblage specimens that represented the bottom flanges of prestressed concrete girders, to determine the effectiveness of straight-legged stirrup anchorage in developing yield strains. Additionally, four girder ends were cast with straight-legged stirrup anchorage details and tested in flexure-shear and web- <b>shear.</b> The straight <b>leg</b> stirrup anchorage detail was determined to be acceptable for Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) M and MN shaped girders as nominal shear capacities were exceeded and yield strains were measured in the stirrups prior to failure during each of the tests.
