Based on research of <b>Org</b> <b>Charts</b> of some other schools of arts, this work could be a clue how to set up and work on the structure or how to deal with its possible changes. The thesis also contains results of an opinion poll that I conducted among directors of basic schools of art in Central Bohemia Region. My work should provide a deeper insight into organization structure in schools of arts and show that an <b>Org</b> <b>Chart</b> is a live document and not just a formal item...|$|R

40|$|TITLE: Organization Structure of a Basic School of Arts AUTHOR: Iveta Sinkulová ABSTRACT: My {{bachelor}} thesis "Organization Structure of a Basic School of Arts" sets a goal {{to research}} which organization structures are applied at basic schools of arts, how the jobs of headmaster and heads of departments are incorporated into the <b>Org</b> <b>Chart</b> and which tasks are delegated to {{them in terms of}} the management of teaching process. The first thing performed was descriptive research. Then the work of deputy headmaster and heads of departments is analysed and areas for delegation of tasks and corresponding jobs are suggested. Based on research of <b>Org</b> <b>Charts</b> of some other schools of arts, this work could be a clue how to set up and work on the structure or how to deal with its possible changes. My research and conclusions will well serve to the headmasters of basic schools of art, who care about how to control the teaching process and better organize the jobs. The output should provide a holistic view on the subjects. <b>Org</b> <b>Charts</b> should be a live document and not just a formal thing...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines chatroom {{data gathered}} {{over the course}} of approximately five months at a small software organization to determine whether the power hierarchy in such organizations diverges from the <b>org</b> <b>chart</b> bestowed by the organization and, if so, what role communication plays {{in the formation of the}} negotiated power hierarchy that emerges instead. The analysis of the data was conducted using three frameworks: Brown and Levinson's Politeness Theory, French and Raven's Bases of Power, and a framework of my own design, Domain / Authority Acknowledgement, which was developed to operationalize the "followership" aspect of power as defined by Holland and Offerman. This dissertation argues that the <b>org</b> <b>chart</b> in such organizations is often a facade, and that analysis using the frameworks listed above allows researchers to identify the true power relationships that exist among the organizations' members.   Ph.

50|$|The Federal Government Business Reference Model (FA BRM) {{provides}} an organized, hierarchical construct for describing the day-to-day business {{operations of the}} Federal government. While many models exist for describing organizations - <b>org</b> <b>charts,</b> location maps, etc. - this model presents the business using a functionally driven approach. The Lines of Business and Sub-functions that comprise the BRM represent a departure from previous models of the Federal government that use antiquated, stovepiped, agency-oriented frameworks. The BRM is the first layer of the Federal Enterprise Architecture {{and it is the}} main viewpoint for the analysis of data, service components and technology.|$|R
30|$|A Gallup {{survey showed}} (Otani 2015) {{that half of}} all US {{employees}} who quit their jobs do so {{to get away from}} bad bosses. See also Slaughter (2015). Despite university and corporate training, and company slogans, aimed at flattening <b>org</b> <b>charts,</b> celebrating failure, boldly innovating and so on, “bosses are rewarded for cutting rather than building” – laying off employees, offshoring operations, and reducing benefits. As the resulting cognitive dissonance flows completely up and down the hierarchy, everyone is distressed and “dysfunction is the norm in the American workplace.” As a remedy, Gallup’s chief scientist advocates promoting employees to management based primarily on their “natural talent to motivate others and engage workers.” (We note that he said ‘natural talent,’ rather than ‘business education.’) The results of Sull et al. (2015) agree with those of Gallup.|$|R

The real Catbert, unnamed, first {{appeared in}} a series of comic strips from September 12 to 16, 1994, when he attacked Ratbert and rebooted Dilbert's computer before Dogbert finally kicked him out of the house. Reader response asked for [...] "more Catbert," [...] despite the cat never having been named, and Adams decided to bring him back as the [...] "evil director" [...] of human resources. Catbert appeared again on March 20, 1995, when Dogbert hired Catbert to handle downsizing (a process that leads to Alice and Wally running for the new <b>org</b> <b>chart</b> and colliding so hard while that they ended up wearing each other's clothes, backwards).|$|R

50|$|Cabinet-level {{officials}} have positions {{that are considered}} to be of Cabinet level, but which {{are not part of the}} Cabinet. Which exact positions are considered part of the presidential cabinet, can vary with the president. The CIA and FEMA were cabinet-level agencies under Bill Clinton, but not George W. Bush. The head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (aka the drug czar) was a cabinet-level position under both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, but not under Barack Obama. (Not to be confused with the head of the DEA, who has remained in the <b>org</b> <b>chart</b> underneath the cabinet position held by the Attorney General.) Designation of an agency as being cabinet-level requires that Congress enact legislation, although executive orders unilaterally created by the president can be used to create many other types of position inside the executive branch. Members of the cabinet proper, as well as cabinet-level officials, meet with the president in a room adjacent to the Oval Office.|$|R
30|$|The ride-share {{company is}} defined to a {{considerable}} degree by riders’ experiences with drivers, who are not employees, do not wear a uniform, and are free to speak their minds with no managerial oversight (Uber does, however, collect rider reviews, which are tracked closely). The founding CEO in particular set many corporate/cultural norms {{at the top of}} the <b>org</b> <b>chart,</b> but they were especially problematic for the company at large: given the need for the model to scale, and given the vast number and global variety of driver-rider interactions, it is difficult to instill customer-facing behaviors in the same way McDonald’s trains counter clerks or Wal-Mart hires greeters. Instead, organizational practice at Uber flows {{to a considerable}} extent from the periphery (where policies, norms, and procedures are hard to mandate) inward. Balancing the need for organizational performance at a very large scale with a nearly complete absence of managerial oversight at the driver level is proving to be a significant challenge: improving relations between drivers and the company will need to be a main focus of the new CEO.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Did I Stutter?," [...] Toby and Ryan {{together}} (who {{both have}} a problem with Jim; Toby dislikes him for dating Pam and Ryan dislikes him for going over his head) warn Jim on his job performance, citing specifically his indifference toward his job and use of time (namely [...] "goofing off with Dwight" [...] and [...] "time spent at Reception" [...] with Pam). Toby then says to the camera that Jim's time spent with Pam [...] "has finally caught up to him," [...] but he repeats Pam's name several times when unnecessary. Toby later says, though, that he agrees that Jim has good numbers but Ryan thinks they are not good enough. In the same episode, Toby convinces Michael he needs to deal with Stanley for his open insubordination during a staff meeting, though Michael goes about it a different way because Toby's method [...] "did not work because it was stupid." [...] Michael also says Toby does not have any friends, but Michael does so in the context of stating that Stanley is Michael's friend, which is later shown to be completely inaccurate as Stanley despises him for his stupidity and is not afraid to confront Micheal about it. It is also shown that Dwight thinks Toby may be Jewish, as Dwight's <b>org</b> <b>chart</b> shows a blue Star of David with a question mark next to Toby's name; Toby did not say what (if any) religion he practiced when Michael prodded the staffers to talk about their religious practices in Fun Run. As Toby spent time in a seminary (as revealed in season five episode [...] "Casual Friday,") he is most likely a Roman Catholic.|$|R
