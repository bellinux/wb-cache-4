25|$|After the two crews {{exchanged}} greetings, {{they performed}} a <b>safety</b> <b>briefing,</b> {{and then set}} right to work, beginning transfers and preparing for robotic operations. At 02:50 UTC, Chamitoff and Magnus officially switched positions, with the swap of their Soyuz seatliners. Chamitoff joined the STS-126 crew as a Mission Specialist, and Magnus officially became the Flight Engineer 2 for Expedition 18.|$|E
25|$|The crew of Discovery {{got to work}} in {{the morning}} {{preparing}} for rendezvous and docking with the space station. After performing the rendezvous pitch maneuver (RPM) to allow the Expedition 18 crew to photograph the underside of the orbiter, Discovery successfully docked with the station at 21:20 UTC. Following hatch leak checks, the hatches were opened at 23:09 UTC. After greeting each other, the crews had a mandatory station <b>safety</b> <b>briefing,</b> and then set to work with initial transfers, including the exchange of Magnus' Soyuz seat liner for Wakata's. The swap of the seat liners marked Wakata officially joining the Expedition 18 crew as Flight Engineer, and Magnus became a Mission Specialist for STS-119.|$|E
25|$|Docking to Harmony/Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 {{occurred}} {{a couple}} of minutes ahead of schedule at 16:51 UTC. The joined spacecraft were orbiting 220 miles above Earth at the time of docking, above Australia and Tasmania. After leak checks, the hatchway between Atlantis and the space station was opened at 18:28 UTC. The traditional welcome ceremony and the station <b>safety</b> <b>briefing</b> followed, and shuttle and station crews began their joint operations for the rest of day. The astronauts worked to move the spacewalking suits carried up on Atlantis over to the Quest airlock for use in the EVAs. After the hatch opening, astronaut Nicole Stott’s tenure as a station Expedition 21 flight engineer came to an end as she joined the Atlantis crew.|$|E

25|$|Flight day 3 saw {{the docking}} of Endeavour to the Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA) 2 on the ISS. The docking {{occurred}} on 18 May 2011 at 10:14 UTC. After the shuttle docked, the six astronauts of STS-134 joined the Expedition 27 crew {{on board the}} ISS. The joint crews completed a series of leak checks and opened the hatches at 11:38 UTC. Once the hatches were open, the joint crew held a welcome ceremony and completed a <b>safety</b> <b>briefing.</b> The first task for the joint crew was to unberth the Express Logistics Carrier (ELC) 3, and attach it to its final location on the ISS's Port 3 (P3) truss segment. Express Logistics Carrier 3 {{was removed from the}} payload bay of Endeavour by the SRMS and handed off to the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS), also known as Canadarm2. The ELC 3 was finally installed at 16:18 UTC. Kelly began to transfer oxygen from space shuttle Endeavour to the ISS. Mike Fincke and Drew Feustel transferred the two Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) to the ISS's Quest Airlock in preparation for their use during the mission's four spacewalks.|$|E
25|$|The orbiter docked to the ISS on Flight Day 3, {{marking the}} 13th time Discovery {{had visited the}} ISS. The docking {{occurred}} on time at 19:14 UTC. A hard mate between the two vehicles was delayed by about 40 minutes because of relative motion between the station and shuttle, thus putting the crew behind the timeline for the day. The hatches were finally opened at 21:16 UTC, and the Expedition 26 crew greeted the crew of STS-133. After the welcome ceremony and <b>safety</b> <b>briefing,</b> the crew's main task {{of the day was}} to transfer the ExPRESS Logistics Carrier 4 (ELC-4). ELC-4 was taken out of Discovery's payload bay by the Space Station Remote Manipulator (SSRMS), also known as Canadarm2, which was operated by Nicole Stott and Michael Barratt. The SSRMS handed it to the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS), which was being controlled by Boe and Drew, while the SSRMS moved to the Mobile Base System (MBS). Once there, the SSRMS took ELC-4 back from the SRMS, and installed it at its location on the S3 truss location. ELC-4 was installed in its final location at 03:22 UTC on 27 February. While the robotic transfer was going on, Bowen and Lindsey were transferring items that were needed for Flight Day 4 and the spacewalk on Flight Day 5.|$|E
25|$|Space shuttle Discovery {{successfully}} docked {{with the}} space station at 07:44 UTC (03:44 EDT) on 7 April 2010 as the two spacecraft sailed 220 miles above the Caribbean. The crew performed six successful engine firings {{to set up the}} on-time docking. Prior to docking commander Poindexter guided Discovery through the standard Rendezvous Pitch Maneuver (RPM). Station commander Oleg Kotov and flight engineer T.J. Creamer took more than 350 photos of Discoverys heat shield. Once Discovery docked to the International Space Station (ISS), a series of leak checks were done {{on both sides of the}} hatch by the shuttle and station crews. The hatches between the two vehicles were opened at 09:11 UTC (05:11 EDT), which was 30 minutes earlier than planned. Once the hatches were opened the STS-131 crew got a <b>safety</b> <b>briefing</b> from the station crew, then began to transfer items that would be needed for later in the day and early on flight day 4. Two items that were transferred were the two EMUs that will be used for the three spacewalks. The crew also completed a grapple of the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) with the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) also known as Canadarm2. Once the OBSS was grappled it was unberthed from the starboard sill of the space shuttle payload bay, and handed off to the SRMS. Throughout the day, after docking to the station, the shuttle crew began downlinking all of the inspection video from flight day 2, and launch imagery and video.|$|E

2500|$|Many popular surfing {{destinations}} have surf {{schools and}} surf camps that offer lessons. Surf camps for beginners and intermediates are multi-day lessons {{that focus on}} surfing fundamentals. They are designed to take new surfers and help them become proficient riders. All-inclusive surf camps offer overnight accommodations, meals, lessons and surfboards. Most surf lessons begin with instruction and a <b>safety</b> <b>briefing</b> on land, followed by instructors helping students into waves on longboards or [...] "softboards". The softboard is considered the ideal surfboard for learning, {{due to the fact}} it is safer, and has more paddling speed and stability than shorter boards. Funboards are also a popular shape for beginners as they combine the volume and stability of the longboard with the manageable size of a smaller surfboard.|$|E
2500|$|Atlantis docked {{with the}} ISS Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 at 15:07 UTC {{as the two}} orbited 220 miles (350km) over the South Pacific Ocean east of New Zealand.

2500|$|During {{the first}} part of the crew's workday, they {{performed}} a series of burns to catch up and dock with the International Space Station (ISS). Once the shuttle was [...] below the ISS, commander George Zamka began what is known as the Rendezvous Pitch Maneuver (RPM). During the maneuver, ISS commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Oleg Kotov took photos of the shuttle's thermal protection system (TPS). Space shuttle Endeavour docked with the ISS at 5:26 UTC (00:06 EST). After completing leak checks the hatches between both vehicles were opened at 6:26 UTC (1:26 EST). The joint Expedition 22/STS-130 crew conducted the standard welcome ceremony and then conducted their <b>safety</b> <b>brief.</b> Once that was complete commander George Zamka, Bob Behnken and Steve Robinson began transferring the spacesuits Behnken and Nick Patrick will use for the three spacewalks. Also during this time Nick Patrick and ISS flight engineer T.J. Creamer picked up the OBSS boom and handed it off to the space shuttle robot arm using the station's SSRMS or Canadarm2.

5|$|The {{engineering}} set {{did provide}} some challenges; a health and <b>safety</b> <b>brief</b> {{was required for}} the actors on it as it was still raised off the ground. Furthermore, {{the results of the}} bubbles being sent through water tubes that represented part of the engine core created noise issues for the sound technicians; they asked for it to be turned off whenever it wasn't placed in shot. One of the special effects went wrong, causing an actual explosion behind Jeri Ryan rather than simply creating sparks following the weapons fire which would be edited in during post-optical effects. The explosion remained in the final cut. The final day of the shoot took place on March 10; taking the filming period to eight days, a day longer than normal for Voyager episodes. It took place on the set of the Dauntless bridge, in the orange color scheme. The final full scene filmed was of the scene {{at the end of the}} episode where the Dauntless returns to Borg space and Arturis realises he is about to be assimilated, and after an hour of closeups for various scenes, the shoot ended at 12:50am on March 11.|$|R
