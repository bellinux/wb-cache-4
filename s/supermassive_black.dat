Assuming a Keplerian orbit, measuring the centripetal acceleration and velocity of water maser spots yields the physical diameter subtended by the maser spots. By then comparing the physical radius to the angular diameter measured on the sky, the distance to the maser may be determined. This method is effective with water megamasers because they occur in a small region around an AGN, and have narrow linewidths. This method of measuring distances is being used to provide an independent measure of the Hubble constant that does not rely upon use of standard candles. The method is limited, however, by the small number of water megamasers known at distances within the Hubble flow. This distance measurement also provides a measurement of the mass of the central object, which in this case is a <b>supermassive</b> <b>black</b> hole. Black hole mass measurements using water megamasers is the most accurate method of mass determination for black holes in galaxies other than the Milky Way.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{exploration}} of relativistic gas dynamics {{in the immediate}} vicinity of binary black holes as the system inspirals close to merger in the gravitational radiation-driven regime. We focus on 2 D hydrodynamical studies of comparable-mass, non-spinning systems. Relativistic effects alter the dynamics of gas in this environment in several ways. Because the gravitational potential between the two black holes becomes shallower than in the Newtonian regime, the mini-disks stretch toward the L 1 point and the amount of gas passing {{back and forth between the}} mini-disks increases sharply with decreasing binary separation. This "sloshing" is quasi-periodically modulated at 2 and 2. 75 times the binary orbital frequency, corresponding to timescales of hours to days for <b>supermassive</b> binary <b>black</b> holes. In addition, relativistic effects add an m= 1 component to the tidally-driven spiral waves in the disks that are purely m= 2 in Newtonian gravity; this component becomes dominant when the separation is ≲ 100 gravitational radii. Both the sloshing and the spiral waves have the potential to create distinctive radiation features that may uniquely mark <b>supermassive</b> binary <b>black</b> holes in the relativistic regime.
