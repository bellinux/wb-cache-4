500|$|Red-Headed Woman {{begins with}} Harlow seducing her boss Bill LeGendre and {{intentionally}} breaking up his marriage. During her seductions, {{he tries to}} resist and slaps her, at which point <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> deliriously and says [...] "Do it again, I like it! Do it again!" [...] They eventually marry but Harlow seduces a wealthy aged industrialist who is in business with her husband {{so that she can}} move to New York. Although this plan succeeds, she is cast aside when she is discovered having an affair with her chauffeur, in essence cheating on her paramour. Harlow shoots LeGendre, nearly killing him. When she is last seen in the film, she is in France {{in the back seat of}} a limousine with an elderly wealthy gentleman being driven along by the same chauffeur. The film was a boon to Harlow's career and has been described as a [...] "trash masterpiece".|$|E
500|$|Female emus {{court the}} males; the female's plumage darkens {{slightly}} {{and the small}} patches of bare, featherless skin just below the eyes and near the beak turn turquoise-blue. The colour of the male's plumage remains unchanged, although the bare patches of skin also turn light blue. [...] When courting, females stride around, pulling their neck back while puffing out their feathers and emitting low, monosyllabic calls that have been compared to drum beats. This calling can occur when males are out of sight or more than [...] away. [...] Once the male's attention has been gained, the female circles her prospective mate {{at a distance of}} [...] As she does this, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> by turning her neck, {{while at the same time}} keeping her rump facing towards him. If the male shows interest in the parading female, he will move closer; the female continues the courtship by shuffling further away but continuing to circle him.|$|E
2500|$|In The Phantom Menace, Portman had {{to portray}} a {{character}} younger than herself. In Attack of the Clones, however, her character had aged 10 years. Portman had aged {{only five years}} between the two films. She remarks, [...] " [...] {{wants to make sure}} I seem older than Anakin in Attack of the Clones, so it's believable that I can be bossing him around, and he's a little intimidated. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as a little boy – at least {{for the first half of}} the film." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> quizzically for a moment, as <b>she</b> had <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> often {{since he}} had gone to work for Feinheimer.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> imploringly--reassured, yet awed by his gentleness.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> quietly, {{wondering}} whether she should answer.|$|R
2500|$|Female protagonists in aggressively sexual vice {{films were}} usually of two general kinds: the bad girl or the fallen woman. In {{so-called}} [...] "bad girl" [...] pictures, female characters profit from promiscuity and immoral behavior. Jean Harlow, an actress who was by all reports a lighthearted, kind person off the screen, frequently played bad girl characters and dubbed them [...] "sex vultures". Two {{of the most}} prominent examples of bad girl films were Red-Headed Woman (1932) and Baby Face (1933). In Red-Headed Woman, Jean Harlow plays a secretary determined to sleep her way into a more luxurious lifestyle. She seduces her boss and intentionally breaks up his marriage. During her seductions, he tries to resist and slaps her, at which point <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> deliriously and replies [...] "Do it again, I like it! Do it again!" [...] They eventually marry but Harlow seduces a wealthy aged industrialist who is in business with her husband so that she can move to New York. Although this plan succeeds, she is cast aside when she is discovered having an affair with her chauffeur, in essence cheating on her paramour. Harlow shoots the original boss, nearly killing him. When she is last seen in the film, she is in France {{in the back seat of}} a limousine with an elderly wealthy gentleman being driven along by the same chauffeur. The film was a boon to Harlow's career and has been described as a [...] "trash masterpiece." [...] Similarly, in Baby Face Barbara Stanwyck is an abused runaway determined to use sex to advance herself financially and sleeps her way to the top of Gotham Trust. Her progress is illustrated in a recurring visual metaphor of the movie camera panning ever upward along the front of Gotham Trust's skyscraper. Men are driven mad with lust over her and they commit murder, attempt suicide, and are ruined financially for associating with her before she mends her ways in the final reel. In another departure from post-code films, Stanwyck's sole companion for the duration of the picture is a black woman named Chico she took with her when she ran away from home at age 14.|$|E
60|$|Without moving <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{with a sort}} of miserable inquiry.|$|E
6000|$|MALISE {{shakes his}} head, then draws {{back from her}} again, as if [...] afraid to be too close. And again, unseen, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{suddenly}} white, bewildered, {{a little}} doubtful.|$|R
60|$|She laughed understandingly. Her eyes twinkled as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> curiously--as {{one might}} regard a wild beast.|$|R
60|$|SYLVIA (leaning {{back across}} the couch, aside to Charteris). Has she really chucked you? (He nods assent. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> dubiously, and adds) I expect you chucked her.|$|E
60|$|GLORIA. She {{has never}} {{mentioned}} your name to me. (He groans involuntarily. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> rather contemptuously and continues) Except once; {{and then she}} did remind me of something I had forgotten.|$|E
60|$|This time he {{does not}} touch her. But his face looks so wicked and menacing, as he stands leaning against the sun-dial-setting, as it were, his black mark upon the very face of day—that her flight is arrested by horror as <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> indignantly, {{but without}} any trace of fear.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a long, slow look, malevolent, supercilious.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a {{severity}} {{which was}} obviously assumed.|$|R
6000|$|CHARTERIS. No. Of course not. (She {{comes forward}} {{on her side}} of the table. He retreats on his side of it. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with utter scorn; sweeps across to the couch; and sits down imperially. With a great sigh of relief he drops into Paramore's chair.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Carol assured herself, [...] "Whatever faults I may have, I {{certainly}} couldn't ever be jealous. I do like Maud; she's {{always so}} pleasant. But I {{wonder if she}} isn't just a bit fond of fishing for men's sympathy? Playing with Erik, and her married----Well----But <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in that languishing, swooning, mid-Victorian way. Disgusting!" ...|$|E
6000|$|GLORIA. I hope so. (He looks stubbornly {{at her for}} a moment; nods grimly, as if {{he agreed}} to that; and goes into the hotel. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with equal {{steadiness}} until he disappears, when she makes a gesture of relief, and turns to speak to Valentine, who comes running up the steps.) ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He was sad, {{therefore}} she softened instantly.|$|R
60|$|Very slowly {{her eyebrows}} rose up. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> doubtfully.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Ratcliffe's {{tone was}} sharp and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> steadily.|$|R
60|$|Larry and Nora {{are left}} {{together}} for the first time since his arrival. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a smile that perishes as she sees him aimlessly rocking his chair, and reflecting, evidently not about her, with his lips pursed as if he were whistling. With a catch in her throat she takes up Aunt Judy's knitting, and makes a pretence of going on with it.|$|E
6000|$|NAPOLEON. My own--! Stop. Come back. Come back, I order you. (She proudly disregards his savagely {{peremptory}} {{tone and}} continues {{on her way}} to the door. He rushes at her; seizes her by the wrist; and drags her back.) Now, what do you mean? Explain. Explain, I tell you, or--(Threatening her. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with unflinching defiance.) Rrrr! you obstinate devil, you. Why can't you answer a civil question? ...|$|E
60|$|She knows its {{influence}} perfectly, has studied it too well {{to miss a}} grain of its effect on any one. As <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> so steadily and coldly, he not only feels conscious {{that he has no}} guide in the least perception of what is really the complexion of her thoughts, but also that he is being every moment, as it were, removed further and further from her.|$|E
60|$|Her {{lips parted}} and closed again. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> very steadily.|$|R
60|$|She {{was still}} frightened, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> a little piteously.|$|R
60|$|Still <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> steadily, {{and still}} said not one word.|$|R
6000|$|LADY (encouraged by his not refusing point blank). No; {{but that}} is why you must grant it. Are your own demands reasonable? {{thousands}} of lives for the sake of your victories, your ambitions, your destiny! And what I ask is such a little thing. And I am only a weak woman, and you a brave man. (<b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with her eyes full of tender pleading and is about to kneel to him again.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Look at Miss Martin {{and young}} Ward! How tenderly the rogue is {{wrapping}} her up! how kindly <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him!</b> The old folks are whispering behind as {{they wait for}} their carriage. What is their talk, think you? and when shall that pair make a match? When you see those pretty little creatures with their smiles and their blushes, and their pretty ways, {{would you like to}} be the Grand Bashaw? ...|$|E
6000|$|VALENTINE (springing up triumphantly, the agonized voice now solid, ringing, and jubilant). Ah, it's come at last---my {{moment of}} courage. (He seizes her hands: <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in terror.) Our moment of courage! (He draws her to him; kisses her with impetuous strength; and laughs boyishly.) Now you've done it, Gloria. It's all over: we're {{in love with}} one another. (She can only gasp at him.) But what a dragon you were! And how hideously afraid I was! ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the door}} opened, and Annie entered. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> questioningly.|$|R
60|$|The hot color {{burned in}} her cheeks. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> confused--reproachful.|$|R
60|$|Anthea {{felt her}} face grow warm, but <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> steadily.|$|R
