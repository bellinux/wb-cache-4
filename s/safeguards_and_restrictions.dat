40|$|This Note {{engages in}} three areas of analysis. Part II reviews {{the case of}} Telford v. Thurston County Board of Commissioner, which, {{for the first time}} in Washington State, confronted the issue of whether {{associations}} of state officials or agencies are the equivalent of agencies for purposes of the state Public Disclosure Act. Part III examines the broader implications of Telford: (1) whether the principles in Telford should be applied to other state <b>safeguards</b> <b>and</b> <b>restrictions</b> on government agencies, such as the state Open Public Meetings Act, (2) whether the constitutional requirement of one-person-one-vote should be applied to associations of officials that pass resolutions, lobby, and spend tax funds on political call and (3) whether associations of officials and agencies are the equivalent of agencies, acting as “shadow governments,” doing indirectly what public agencies cannot do directly, and thereby avoiding public accountability. Part IV discusses whether the legislature has allowed the delegation of too much power and whether it should (1) restrict associations of government officials or agencies to narrowly defined, nondiscretionary information activities, and (2) open these associations to more effective public disclosure requirements than those provided in existing law, such as a requirement that all association activity be placed on publicly available Internet sites—an Internet Sunshine Law...|$|E

Safeguards for the imported germplasm include intermediate quarantine for groundnut (Arachis sp.) cuttings, fumigation, dry seed inspection, and microscopic examination followed by seed treatment and growing of healthy crops in a quarantine isolation area before releasing seeds of disease free progeny to the scientists. Similarly, inspection of crops before collection of seeds followed by fumigation, microscopic examination, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for groundnut viruses, seed treatment, and finally good packing have been found effective for export of healthy seed...|$|R
40|$|JEL No. F 13 India {{undertook}} a major unilateral liberalization of its import {{policies in the}} 1990 s. Over the subsequent decade, India has also transformed from being a non-user to being the most frequent user {{of two of the}} WTO system’s major exceptions to liberal trade – i. e., antidumping <b>and</b> <b>safeguard</b> policies. This paper exploits product-level data to examine whether and how India’s increasing resort to new antidumping <b>and</b> <b>safeguard</b> import <b>restrictions</b> is related to its tariff reform. First, we provide structural estimates from a Grossman and Helpman (1994) model that is modified to examine determinants of Indian antidumping <b>and</b> <b>safeguard</b> use. We find that products with larger tariff cuts between 1990 and 1997 are associated with an increased likelihood of antidumping <b>and</b> <b>safeguard</b> protection in the early 2000 s. Second, estimates from a reduced-form model confirm these results and suggest that the relationship is economically important – i. e., a one standard deviation increase {{in the size of the}} tariff cut away from the mean increases the predicted probability by almost 50 % of new antidumping or safeguard use. Third, we fin...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to examine empirically the {{relationship}} between import tariff cuts and the subsequent re-imposition of import protection under safeguard exceptions at the product-level. Our approach overcomes potential endogeneity problems by focusing on the case of India, a country that underwent a major exogenous tariff reform program in the early 1990 s and subsequently initiated substantial use of <b>safeguard</b> <b>and</b> antidumping import <b>restrictions.</b> In {{the first part of the}} paper we estimate structural determinants of India’s import protection using the Grossman and Helpman (1994) model. Estimates of the model on India’s pre-reform tariff data from 1990 are consistent with the theory. We then re-estimate the model on the Indian tariff data after the trade liberalization is complete and find that the model no longer fits, a result consistent with theory and evidence provided in other settings that India’s 1991 - 92 IMF arrangement can be interpreted as resulting in an exogenous shock to India’s tariff policy. However, when we re-estimate the model on data from 2000 - 2002 that more completely reflects India’s cross-product variation in import protection by including both its post-reform tariffs and its additional non-tariff barriers of antidumping <b>and</b> <b>safeguard</b> import protection, the significance of the Grossman an...|$|R
30|$|Beyond {{providing}} basic {{content and}} user management, KEF {{serves as a}} collaborative environment, fostering discussion and the sharing of information. Several enhancements are necessary to facilitate this capability in the wiki. We have introduced the concept of User Profiles into KEF through a customized version of the community extension Social Profile [33]. These profiles might contain the standard “social networking” type of information such as name, email address, interests, skills, etc. They also commonly include research interests, publications, projects, and other information {{that might not be}} shared on a traditional social networking site (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIN), but would still be of interest to internal collaborators. We have also bolstered the security system within the wiki environment to adequately protect the users and their research. A wiki, at its core, is an open collaborative environment. Because of the sensitive nature of some analysts’ research, it is often necessary to provide <b>safeguards</b> <b>and</b> access <b>restrictions</b> on their KEF installations. The community extension HaloACL [34] was integrated into KEF to provide security for these cases. This extension provides the capability of hiding complete pages and sub-page elements from users outside a particular user class. For example, a team of analysts might be spread across several institutions, requiring that their KEF installation live on a publicly available web server. While a brief welcome screen and general explanation of the project might be available for public consumption, none of the research, discussion, or modeling that goes on within KEF should be available publicly. Through HaloACL, that installation can be secured so that only registered and approved users that belong to the team of analysts can view or edit the sensitive data in KEF. On some installations, that is all of the data while others only protect a small subset.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to use product-level data to examine empirically whether {{countries}} use antidumping <b>and</b> <b>safeguard</b> exceptions to unwind commitments to lower tariffs in the face of domestic political-economic pressure. We focus on the case of India, a country that underwent a major exogenous tariff reform program in the early 1990 s and subsequently initiated substantial use of <b>safeguard</b> <b>and</b> antidumping import <b>restrictions.</b> We first estimate structural determinants of India's import protection using the Grossman and Helpman (1994) model and provide evidence from its pre-reform tariff data of 1990 that is consistent with the theory.

We interpret these combined results as evidence that India unwound its commitment to reduce tariffs through use of antidumping <b>and</b> <b>safeguard</b> protection in the face of political-economic pressure. The estimates are also economically important and provide one explanation for separate results in the literature that the magnitude of import reduction associated with India's use of antidumping is similar to the initial import expansion associated with its tariff reform. Finally, we interpret the implications of our results for the burgeoning research literature examining the effects of liberalization on India's micro-level development.
