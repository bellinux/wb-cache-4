This distinction applied to both living and dead passengers. Intended to prevent persons from different <b>social</b> <b>background</b> from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment rather than to provide different facilities, the carriages intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors.|$|E
5|$|Despite his equestrian background, Macrinus was {{accepted}} by the Senate for two reasons: {{for the removal of}} Caracalla, and for having received the loyalty of the army. The senators were less concerned by Macrinus' Mauretanian ancestry than by his equestrian <b>social</b> <b>background</b> and scrutinized his actions as emperor. Their opinion of him was reduced by his decisions to appoint men to high offices who were of similarly undistinguished background. Only the Senate had the constitutional power to choose the emperor from among the senators and Macrinus, not being a senator and having become emperor through force rather than through traditional means, was looked down upon.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with {{separate}} Anglican and Nonconformist sections and separate first, second and third class compartments within each. This separation applied to both living and dead passengers. This was to prevent persons from different <b>social</b> <b>background</b> from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment, rather than to provide different levels of facilities for different types of mourner; the compartments intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors. At 11.35am (11.20am on Sundays) the train would leave London for Brookwood, arriving at Necropolis Junction at 12.25pm (12.20pm on Sundays).|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{socio-economic}} status (SES) at both the student and school level is associated with educational outcomes. Students from higher <b>social</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> on average, have greater educational outcomes than their less privileged peers. Also, a student that attends a school that enrols students from primarily high <b>social</b> <b>backgrounds</b> will, on average, have greater educational outcomes than if she attended a school that enrolled students from low <b>social</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> School SES is related to student outcomes through a complex array of factors, including the quality of curriculum and instruction, resources and the learning environment. This article reviews the research literature about the relationship between school socio-economic composition and student outcomes, the mechanisms by which the relationship is enacted in schools, as well as the structural features of education systems that influence how students from varying <b>social</b> <b>backgrounds</b> are distributed across schools. I conclude with suggestions for future research...|$|R

5|$|The Burnets {{moved to}} Terang in 1909, when Frank was posted {{to be the}} bank manager there, having {{declined}} a post in London. Burnet {{was interested in the}} wildlife around the nearby lake; he joined the Scouts in 1910 and enjoyed all outdoor activities. While living in Terang, he began to collect beetles and study biology. He read biology articles in the Chambers's Encyclopaedia, which introduced him to the work of Charles Darwin. During his early teens, the family took annual holidays to Port Fairy, where Burnet spent his time observing and recording the behaviour of the wildlife. He was educated at Terang State School and attended Sunday school at the local church, where the priest encouraged him to pursue scholastic studies and awarded him a book on ants as a reward for his academic performance. He advised Frank to invest in Mac's education and he won a full scholarship to board and study at Geelong College, one of Victoria's most exclusive private schools. Starting there in 1913, Burnet was the only boarder with a full scholarship. He did not enjoy his time there among the scions of the ruling upper class; while most of his peers were brash and sports-oriented, Burnet was bookish and not athletically inclined, and found his fellow students to be arrogant and boorish. During this period he kept his beetle-collecting and disapproval of his peers a secret and mixed with his schoolmates out of necessity. Nevertheless, his academic prowess gained him privileges, and he graduated in 1916, placing first in his school overall, and in history, English, chemistry and physics. The typical university path for a person of his <b>social</b> <b>background</b> was to pursue studies in theology, law or medicine. By this time, he was becoming disillusioned with religion and chose medicine. Due to World War I, military service was a possibility and he felt that a medical background would increase his chances of being given a non-combat post.|$|E

25|$|Wertham {{was born}} on March 20, 1895 in Munich, under the name Friedrich Ignatz Wertheimer. He did not change his name legally to Fredric Wertham until 1927. He studied at King's College London, at the Universities of Munich and Erlangen, and {{graduated}} with an M.D. degree from the University of Würzburg in 1921. He was very much influenced by Dr. Emil Kraepelin, a professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Munich, and worked briefly at the Kraepelin Clinic in Munich in 1922. Kraepelin emphasized the effects of environment and <b>social</b> <b>background</b> on psychological development. Around this time Wertham corresponded and visited with Sigmund Freud, who influenced him in his choice of psychiatry as his specialty.|$|E
25|$|Though {{normally}} {{loved by}} most of his countrymen, Storm P. has also been criticised for being too toothless, cosy and petit bourgeois. In spite of his <b>social</b> <b>background</b> and interest of poor milieus, he very seldom shows deeper social criticism or revolutionary opinions; the dramatic age in which he lived left rather small stamps on his work. On the other hand he was no staunch giggler; many of his paintings deal with death, sorrow and macabre themes. Though not a revolutionary, he has indeed painted the victims of social injustice and misery, often with a strong touch of compassion. Melancholy and fear are not unknown to him, but his official appearance was an optimistic one.|$|E

Ryti only began to exercise his duties as chairman of the Bank of Finland after he resigned as finance minister in January 1924. During his early years in parliament, Ryti succeed in bringing order to the government budget. Although he was a Ståhlbergian, Ryti did not approve of pardoning Red prisoners.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the sharing of household chores, certain cultures expect adolescents to share in their family's financial responsibilities. According to family economic and financial education specialists, adolescents develop sound money management skills through the practices of saving and spending money, {{as well as through}} planning ahead for future economic goals. Differences between families in the distribution of financial responsibilities or provision of allowance may reflect various <b>social</b> <b>background</b> circumstances and intrafamilial processes, which are further influenced by cultural norms and values, {{as well as by the}} business sector and market economy of a given society. For instance, in many developing countries it is common for children to attend fewer years of formal schooling so that, when they reach adolescence, they can begin working.|$|E
