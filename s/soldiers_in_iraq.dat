25|$|During the 2008 presidential election, Obama {{strongly}} {{criticized the}} Iraq War, and Obama withdrew {{the vast majority}} of U.S. <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> by late 2011. On taking office, Obama announced that U.S. combat forces would leave Iraq by August 2010, with 35,000–50,000 American soldiers remaining in Iraq as advisers and trainers, down from the roughly 150,000 American <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> in early 2009. In 2008, President Bush had signed the U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, in which the United States committed to withdrawing all forces by late 2011. Obama attempted to convince Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to allow U.S. soldiers to stay past 2011, but the large presence of American soldiers was unpopular with most Iraqis. By late-December 2011, only 150 American soldiers remained to serve at the US embassy. However, in 2014, the U.S. began a campaign against ISIL, an Islamic extremist terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria that grew dramatically after the withdrawal of U.S. soldiers from Iraq and the start of the Syrian Civil War. By June 2015, there were about 3500 American <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> serving as advisers to anti-ISIL forces in the Iraqi Civil War, and Obama left office with roughly 5,262 U.S. <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and 503 of them in Syria.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of Walden College, Trudeau has frequently used real-life settings, based on real scenarios, but with fictional results. Due to deadlines, some real-world events have rendered some of Trudeau's comics unusable, such as a 1973 series featuring John Ehrlichman, a 1989 series set in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, a 1993 series involving Zoë Baird, and a 2005 series involving Harriet Miers. Trudeau has also displayed fluency in various forms of jargon, including those of real estate agents, flight attendants, computer scientists, journalists, presidential aides, and <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E
500|$|For soldiers, the {{benefits}} are straightforward, but for the officers {{in charge of the}} system {{the benefits}} are much more extensive. [...] Transporting U.S. currency overseas costs the military {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} annually [...] during the Iraq War, for every $1,000,000 sent to pay <b>soldiers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> it cost $60,000 in security, logistics, and support fees. [...] It also eliminates the need for the World War II practice of producing the Military Payment Certificate. [...] The use of a cashless economy at military stores reduces transaction times, freeing personnel from tasks like stamping money orders or counting coins [...] during 9 months of the Iraq War, this saved approximately 5000 hours of processing time for financial personnel. [...] It also prevents counterfeiting.|$|E
