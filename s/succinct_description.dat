So too with its studies. Rentless logic, with its formidable chevaux-de-frise of syllogisms, propositions, scholia; Metaphysics, sublime, but hardened into slabs of theories, congealed in medieval Latin; Physics, embracing a course that would have appalled a young Newton or Kepler; and then the vast shadow of four years' Divinity towering above and over-shadowing all!". The Maynooth literature course was hardly any better: [...] "The Graces were nowhere! Even in the English literature or Belles-Lettres class, as it was called, the course seemed to be limited to hard grinding Grammar, and nothing more. [...] During the first semestre, a few lectures were given on literature. All I can ever remember of that period were the words 'Lake Poets', which the good professor was forever repeating".|$|E

40|$|One of {{the central}} {{challenges}} {{in the study of}} quantum many-body systems is the complexity of simulating them on a classical computer. A recent advance (Landau et al. in Nat Phys, 2015) gave a polynomial time algorithm to compute a <b>succinct</b> classical <b>description</b> for unique ground states of gapped 1 D quantum systems. Despite this progress many questions remained unsolved, including whether there exist efficient algorithms when the ground space is degenerate (and of polynomial dimension in the system size), or for the polynomially many lowest energy states, or even whether such states admit <b>succinct</b> classical <b>descriptions</b> or area laws. In this paper we give a new algorithm, based on a rigorously justified RG type transformation, for finding low energy states for 1 D Hamiltonians acting on a chain of nparticles. In the process we resolve some of the aforementioned open questions, including giving a polynomial time algorithm for poly(n) degenerate ground spaces and an n^(O(log n)) algorithm for the poly(n) lowest energy states (under a mild density condition). For these classes of systems the existence of a <b>succinct</b> classical <b>description</b> and area laws were not rigorously proved before this work. The algorithms are natural and efficient, and for the case of finding unique ground states for frustration-free Hamiltonians the running time is Õ(nM(n)), where M(n) is the time required to multiply two n × n matrices...|$|R

Query refinement helps a user improve a query fragment to describe the user's interests more precisely. Once a query has been refined and describes a manageable result set, query routing automatically forwards the query to relevant servers.
