The impure metal, usually in the form of molten blister copper, is placed in an anode furnace for two stages of refining.

This involves using a reducing agent, normally natural gas or diesel (but ammonia, liquid petroleum gas, and naphtha [...] can also be used), to react with the oxygen in the copper oxide to form copper metal. In the past, freshly cut ("green") trees were used as wooden poles. The sap in these poles acted as the reducing agent.

The single-crystalline Sn 1 -xVxO 2 (0 ≤x≤ 0. 1) thin films, grown on Al 2 O 3 substrate, are (101) oriented and exhibit a temperature-dependent in-plane anisotropy of the saturation magnetization. The in-plane magnetic moment {{reaches a maximum}} close to the [101 ¯] direction, but the anisotropy axis is incompatible with the crystalline structure of the SnO 2 thin films. However, it is consistent with V atoms occupying uniaxially distorted octahedral interstices, thus breaking the symmetry of the film. The moment anisotropy decreases gradually with increasing temperature and persists to temperatures above room temperature. It is modeled as a spin-orbit effect involving the hopping of orbital-current loops, as contrasted to isotropic Heisenberg exchange, and the temperature dependence of the magnetism is explained {{on the basis of}} a thermal admixture of nearly degenerate crystal-field states.

Considerable attention has been drawn recently to its application in PSCs as an alternative ETL with the goal of enhancing device performance and light stability, as it has a larger band gap (~ 3.6  eV at 300  K), higher electrical conductivity, and greater chemical stability than TiO 2 semiconductors [2]. Various synthetic routes to SnO 2, including sol–gel methods [14], molten-salt synthesis [15], microwave techniques [16], atomic layer deposition (ALD), and electrochemical deposition (ED) [17 – 20] have been developed. ALD and spin-coating solution processes are the dominant methods for fabricating SnO 2 ETLs in PSCs [21 – 23]. The fabrication of ETLs in photovoltaic devices is paramount for limiting production costs because of the requirements for its production, such as thermal treatment, multiple processing steps, operation control, and scalable processing.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the toxicity of selected metal oxide nanoparticles (MO-NPs) on the brine shrimp Artemia salina, by evaluating mortality and behavioural and biochemical responses. Larvae were exposed to tin(IV) oxide (<b>stannic</b> <b>oxide</b> (SnO 2)), cerium(IV) oxide (CeO 2) and iron(II, III) oxide (Fe 3 O 4) NPs for 48 h in seawater, with MO-NP suspensions from 0. 01 to 1. 0 mg/mL. Mortality and behavioural responses (swimming speed alteration) and enzymatic activities of cholinesterase, glutathione-S-transferase and catalase were evaluated. Although the MO-NPs did not induce any mortality of the larvae, they caused changes in behavioural and biochemical responses. Swimming speed significantly decreased in larvae exposed to CeO 2 NPs. Cholinesterase and glutathione-S-transferase activities were significantly inhibited in larvae exposed to SnO 2 NPs, whereas cholinesterase activity significantly increased after CeO 2 NP and Fe 3 O 4 NP exposure. Catalase activity significantly increased in larvae exposed to Fe 3 O 4 NPs.

40|$|Various {{metal oxides}} (MOx) were {{dispersed}} onto a glassy carbon (GC) surface {{for the purpose}} of catalyzing the oxida-tion ofascorbic acid (AH 2). Of the 37 different metal oxides examined, more than 20 showed varying degrees of rate enhance-ment (henceforth referred to as activation) for AH 2 oxidation. The highest degree of activation was exhibited by those MOx's whose oxidation state of the metal was + 3 or higher, such as zirconium oxide, ceric oxide, cobaltic oxide, chromic oxide, <b>stannic</b> <b>oxide,</b> and the previously reported alumina. The double layer capacitance was also observed to increase with MOx/GC's compared to the bare GC electrode. This increase suggested that the surface area of the GC electrodes increased due to the dispersion of MOx. The pH dependence ofthe AH 2 activation at MOx/GC was considerably different from that at a bare GC electrode and suggested that the enhancement mechanism ay involve an acceleration ofa proton-transfer step via AH 2 interaction with the MOx/GC surface. A model of the physical structure of the MOx/GC surface is proposed to account for the carbon surface activation.

40|$|Tin 2 -ethylhexanoate {{is used as}} a {{catalyst}} in the synthesis of room temperature cured polysiloxane rubbers. The catalyst has the potential to influence the important load bearing and ageing properties of the rubber. In this study, the structure of the catalyst {{and the nature of the}} tin species in both fresh and thermally aged polysiloxane samples (RTV 5370) have been investigated. Infra-red and 13 C NMR of the catalyst confirms the presence of 2 -ethyl hexanoate ligands on the tin. Mössbauer Spectroscopy of the catalyst shows that the tin exists predominantly in the tin(II) oxidation state with some residual tin(IV) impurities. The tin(IV) phase predominates in the as-synthesised rubber, representing some 67 % of the total tin signal, with the remainder being unreacted tin(II) species. The tin(IV) phase in the catalyst and that in the rubber are different. Overall, our observations suggest that the catalyst has taken part in the cure reaction and has been chemically modified as a result. The isomer shift (IS) and the quadrupole splitting (QS) from Mössbauer Spectroscopy suggests that the tin (IV) phase in the rubber is most probably SnO 2 (<b>stannic</b> <b>oxide).</b> Toluene extraction studies show that this phase is not extractable from the rubber network, whereas the tin(II) species is easily removed.

It is shown that the co-presence of the two materials improves the power output of fuel cells up to a factor of 10 when compared to ceria alone. Through high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) data we show the formation of a novel system made up of nanoparticles composed of a molten Sn 0 core capped by an amorphous tin oxide layer. SnOx shell acts as a binding agent which stabilizes Sn 0 nanoparticles on ceria even after reductive treatment at temperatures well above the melting point of tin. This occurs through an interfacial redox communication between ceria and tin, likely involving a transfer of oxygen from ceria to the metal and electrons from metal to ceria.

The chemically sensitive layer {{consists of a}} paste prepared from metal-oxide powder, inorganic additives and organic binders. The paste is printed over an alumina substrate containing metal film electrodes and a back heating resistor; the paste is then sintered in a thermal or IR belt furnace. Since <b>stannic</b> <b>oxide</b> is {{the most frequently used}} material, we shall restrict our discussion to SnO 2 -based sensors, which are currently prepared and characterized in our laboratory. SnO 2 is extremely sensitive to trace concentration of reactive gases in air, while it presents a lack of intrinsic selectivity; however, the selectivity can be improved by the addition of catalysts and promoters. The conductivity of a high-porosity n-type thick film changes {{in the presence of a}} reducing gas due to a combustion process that lowers the surface coverage of oxygen ions, causing the return of electrons to the conduction band and lowering the Schottky-barrier heights at the intergranular contacts.

40|$|Dye sensitised {{solar cells}} (DSCs) {{typically}} include a mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO 2) scaffold, sensitised with an adsorbed dye, {{as the main}} active element responsible for the photon absorption and charge separation functionalities. The sintering process employed in the TiO 2 active layer fabrication {{plays a crucial role}} in the formation of the nanoparticle (NP) scaffold and hence in the performance of a dye sensitised solar cell, as it allows the particles to form efficient inter-crystalline electric contacts providing high electron conductivity. Furthermore, the DSC design requires a conductive transparent top electrode which is typically made of fluorinated <b>stannic</b> <b>oxide.</b> Here we report on a highly spatially resolved scanning electron microscopy study in conjunction with focussed ion beam milling and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping of the distribution of all relevant elements within a DSC subsequent to a classical sintering process in the range of 350 °C- 550 °C. Additionally, the article provides quantitative results regarding the found Sn diffusion and its effect on efficiency confirmed via J-V measurements. The effective spatial resolution of the EDX studies was calculated by Monte Carlo simulations of the electron trajectories and X-ray emission region. This permits to construct a model for the migration of Sn from the transparent conductive oxide into the TiO 2 scaffold, resulting in alterations in the composition of the complex system which has a direct effect on the DSC performance. J-V measurements conclude that sintering temperature of 500 °C is close to the optimum regarding Sn diffusion enhancement of DSCs. Sintering temperatures above 500 °C were causing a drop in the DSC efficiency and are therefore not recommended. In order to optimize the DSC efficiency, the results are summarized by a model that explains how the efficiency varies with the Sn diffusion process...|$|E

30|$|<b>Stannic</b> <b>oxide</b> (SnO 2) {{has been}} greatly studied in many fields for its electronic, catalytic, and optical {{properties}} [1, 2, 3]. It is often employed as a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) by doping with indium (ITO) or fluorine. These transparent substrates are heavily used in optoelectronic applications as transparent conductors such as thin film LEDs and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) [4, 5, 6]. In DSSC applications, {{it is imperative that}} nanomaterials can effectively separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs and that the electrons can be harvested into the external circuit from the nanomaterials before recombination or trapping in defect states [7]. To this end, high-quality single-crystal nanowires or nanorods are often employed as the active material [8, 9]. However, nanowires deposited as a slurry are randomly oriented and do not necessarily lead to the TCO layer or the external circuit. TiO 2 nanorods have been grown, deposited, or attached to FTO substrates in a number of clever ways including double-sided brush-like flakes via hydrothermal reaction [10, 11] and around carbon fibers via microwave hydrothermal reaction [12]. Carney et al. [13] originally showed that Au-tipped SnO 2 nanowires could be grown directly from pressed and sintered 95 % SnO 2 – 5 % CoO pellets with a sputtered Au thin film through a vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism at 700 – 800  °C. This method greatly simplifies nanowire growth compared to many other techniques that utilize an upstream source and downstream substrate [14, 15], often needing independently controlled temperature zones to induce condensation [16]. The present work shows that a modification of this method can grow single-crystal SnO 2 nanowires from polycrystalline thin films of fluorine-doped SnO 2 (FTO) on glass substrates at a reduced temperature of 580  °C. These nanowires are then used as an anchored 3 D host to create a novel hierarchical nanobrush-like structure using hydrothermally grown TiO 2 nanorods. This immobilized structure is designed to maximize the surface area of the photoactive material while aiding more efficient photogenerated charge carrier separation and extraction for photocatalysis and dye-sensitized solar cells. Photogenerated electrons should move into the single-crystal SnO 2 nanowire core due to a larger work function, leaving the separated hole to react with the solution or dye at the surface. The high-quality core nanowire can then help shuttle the electrons directly to the thin film on which it is anchored and grown, where it can then be collected to pass through an external circuit. Similar morphologies of nanoheterostructures have been synthesized with different combinations of materials previously and led to unique or enhanced properties [17, 18, 19]. This is a promising and simple process for creating nanoheterostructures on commercially available and widely used FTO substrates that may also lead to enhanced properties in photocatalysis, DSSCs, and gas sensing.|$|E
40|$|At {{the present}} time, it is {{generally}} accepted that tin veins can be deposited from pneumatolytic as well as hydrothermal solutions, although those of pneumatolytic origin, containing characteristic pneumatolytic minerals such as fluorite, topaz, tourmaline, apatite and other fluorine and boron-bearing minerals, and accompanied by typical pneumatolytic alterations of the country rock, are of commoner occurrence. That the veins under consideration were not formed under pure pneumatolytic conditions is indicated {{by the absence of}} characteristic pneumatolytic alterations of the wall-rocks. The slaty rocks in which the veins are enclosed are often intensely chloritized, silicified, epidotized and sideritized, while no characteristic pneumatolytic minerals have been observed in them even under the microscope. These alterations are regarded to be characteristic of hydrothermal processes. Moreover, the veins themselves contain usually more or less siderite and chlorite, as can easily be revealed under the microscope. These minerals occur, through rather sparingly, in ordinary cassiterite veins, and are most abundantly associated with hydrothermal tin veins, siderite, particularly, being of deposition, in most tin veins, in the last stage of pneumatolysis, or in pneumato-hydatogenetic or hydrothermal stages. The occurrence of chalcedony, evidently transformed from an opaline silica, as an important gangue-mineral is most instructive. This mineral is an extremely rare associate of ten-stone. Only a few examples of tin veins containing chalcedony have hitherto been reported, and they all belong to the category formed under hydrothermal or allied conditions. As already fully discussed under the heading of "the deposition of the main cassiterite ore," the presence of chalcedony in the veins under consideration indicates that they were formed under hydrothermal conditions at a temperature below 360 ℃. On the other hand, {{it must be noted that}} some minerals regarded as common associates of pneumatolytic deposits, such as fluorspar, wolframite and bismuth ores with sporadic microscopic topaz, are present in the veins. There minerals are, of course, of very common occurrence in the deposits formed at high temperatures, but may be deposited either from gaseous solutions or from superheated aqueous solutions containing soluble or gaseous compounds of fluorine, tungsten and bismuth. Typical hydrothermal veins containing scheelite, wolframite, fluorspar, bismuth ores, etc. are numerous even in this country. The veins of this district are unique in the fact that the orebringer for them is a dioritic magma. Considering, however, that acid rocks can be derived from a basic magma by processes of differentiation chiefly due to fractional crystallization and setting or by the expulsion of the residual fluid magma, and that an acid differentiation-product with a composition or quartz-monzonite-pegmatite or aplite, akenobeite, is actually found as a small boss in this district, the genetic connection of the veins with the dioritic rocks is highly probable. Summarizing all that has been stated, the copper tin veins of the Akenobe district were deposited from hydrothermal solutions, still containing fair quantities of mineralizers, at gradually decreasing temperatures, chiefly considerably below 360 ℃. The solutions had naturally a temperature far above the critical point of water (364 ℃) and were gaseous in character, after emanation from the consolidating diorite magma. As they ascended through the surrounding slate complex, the rate of the fall of temperature was very rapid, and they soon changed to superheated hydrothermal solutions. Lastly, the writer frankly states that he is quite in the dark as to whether the <b>stannic</b> <b>oxide</b> first separated from the solutions in the colloid state and subsequently became crystalline, or whether it crystallized directly as cassiterite by chemical reactions between stannic fluoride and other compounds...|$|E
