5|$|The Disney bomb, by contrast, was {{designed}} {{from the start}} to penetrate the thick concrete roofs of fortified bunkers. Whereas the earthquake bomb's target was the bunker itself, the Disney bomb's target was the bunker's contents. To this end, the warhead was composed of an unusually thick <b>steel</b> <b>shell</b> containing a comparatively small amount of explosive. It was much slimmer than was usual for aircraft-dropped bombs, and a cluster of booster rockets accelerated the weapon as it fell. These features accord with Newton's approximation for impact depth and the empirical design equation known as Young's equation that states that the deepest target penetration is achieved by a projectile that is dense, long and thin (i.e. has a large sectional density), and strikes with a high velocity.|$|E
25|$|The diamond masonry mortar bit is {{a hybrid}} drill bit, {{designed}} {{to work as a}} combination router and drill bit.

25|$|The {{original}} Riga-made Minox had a brass chassis {{covered in}} a stainless <b>steel</b> <b>shell,</b> which telescopes to reveal or cover the lens and viewfinder windows, {{as well as to}} advance the film. It was equipped with a parallax correcting viewfinder, which was coupled to a Cooke triplet type Minostigmat 15mm f/3.5 lens. The lens was capable of focusing as close as 20cm, and, due to its small image size, provided such depth of field at full aperture that a diaphragm was deemed unnecessary. The maximum focus zone was about one meter to infinity. In front of the lens was a metal foil curtain shutter, which was itself protected by a window. These were advanced features at the time for any camera, regardless of size.|$|E
25|$|As {{the seals}} can be {{performed}} at much lower temperature than with direct joining of glass parts and without use of flame (using a temperature-controlled kiln or oven), glass solders are useful in applications like subminiature vacuum tubes or for joining mica windows to vacuum tubes and instruments (e.g., Geiger tube). Thermal expansion coefficient has to be matched to the materials being joined and often is chosen in between the coefficients of expansion of the materials. In case of having to compromise, subjecting the joint to compression stresses is more desirable than to tensile stresses. The expansion matching is not critical in applications where thin layers are used on small areas, e.g., fireable inks, or where the joint will be subjected to a permanent compression (e.g., by an external <b>steel</b> <b>shell)</b> offsetting the thermally introduced tensile stresses.|$|E
40|$|Large, thick <b>steel</b> <b>shells</b> for tooling {{applications}} {{have been}} produced using a robot manipulated electric arc spraying technique with steady-state temperatures ranging from 170 °C to 450 °C. Critical to these experiments has been {{the use of a}} real-time feedback control system for surface temperature based on infrared thermal imaging. There was a reproducible trend in net residual shell distortion as a function of temperature with residual tensile stresses in the shell for temperatures ≤ 210 °C and ≥ 390 °C, and net compressive stresses at intermediate temperatures. In-situ linear displacement sensor experiments have been used to investigate the dynamic distortion of sprayed <b>steel</b> <b>shells</b> on <b>steel</b> substrates, over the same range of surface temperatures. Residual and in-situ distortion measurements confirmed two manufacturing temperatures at which stresses in the <b>steel</b> <b>shells</b> were either minimized or eliminated. A numerical model has been developed to relate shell quench and transformations stresses to the shell dynamic distortion behavior. It is proposed that tensile quench stresses are balanced by the time- and temperature-dependent expansive austenite-to-bainite phase transformation...|$|R

60|$|And it grew--the sphere. December passed, January--I spent a {{day with}} a broom {{sweeping}} {{a path through the}} snow from bungalow to laboratory--February, March. By the end of March the completion was in sight. In January had come a team of horses, a huge packing-case; we had our thick glass sphere now ready, and in position under the crane we had rigged to sling it into the <b>steel</b> <b>shell.</b> All the bars and blinds of the steel shell--it was not really a spherical shell, but polyhedral, with a roller blind to each facet--had arrived by February, and the lower half was bolted together. The Cavorite was half made by March, the metallic paste had gone through two of the stages in its manufacture, and we had plastered quite half of it on to the steel bars and blinds. It was astonishing how closely we kept to the lines of Cavor's first inspiration in working out the scheme. When the bolting together of the sphere was finished, he proposed to remove the rough roof of the temporary laboratory in which the work was done, and build a furnace about it. So the last stage of Cavorite making, in which the paste is heated to a dull red glow in a stream of helium, would be accomplished when it was already on the sphere.|$|E

40|$|During {{our review}} of various DOE {{documents}} related to shielded containers, we have noted several inconsistencies regarding {{the thickness of the}} inner and outer <b>steel</b> <b>shells</b> of the container: Dunagan et al. 2007 (Section 2. 2) lists the thicknesses of the outer and inner walls as 1 / 8 in (0. 125) and 3 / 16 in (0. 1875), respectively. Elsewhere (i. e., Section 3. 1. 6. 2), the same authors list the combined thickness of the inner and outer <b>steel</b> <b>shells</b> as 0. 3125 in. According to DOE 2010, Enclosure 1, the inner and outer steel walls are 7 gauge (0. 144 in) and 11 gauge (0. 091 in), respectively. DOE states that the inner wall thickness is 0. 1793 in DOE 2009 Enclosure (Section 4. 2. 3).
