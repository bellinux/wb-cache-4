40|$|Abstract. We {{report a}} case in an infant of horse bot fly myiasis that was unusual because the maggot had {{developed}} to the second instar (of three potential instars). This represents the first report of such late development in a human. The case occurred {{in a rural area}} of the Pacific northwest (Washington) in late summer. Human cutaneous myiasis caused by Gasterophilus hae-morrhoidalis (Gasterophilidae: Diptera), a horse bot com-monly known as the <b>nose</b> <b>fly,</b> has been reported on a few occasions. Larvae burrow just beneath the skin of human hosts producing a visible tortuous path and may cause severe itching. 1, 2 Previous reports end with removal of first-instar larvae, but second and third instars have not been reported on human hosts. This is probably because the first-instar lar-vae are either killed by scratching 3 or removed before they can grow to the next instar. It is unknown if the larva could develop past the second instar in a cutaneous situation since the third (final) instar in the normal host, such as horses...|$|R

500|$|Common {{forms of}} {{preventive}} medication for sheep are vaccinations and treatments for parasites. Both {{external and internal}} parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks. Worms {{are the most common}} internal parasites. They are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again). Oral anti-parasitic medicines, known as drenches, are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after worm eggs in the feces has been counted to assess infestation levels. Afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to avoid ingesting the same parasites. [...] External sheep parasites include: lice (for different parts of the body), <b>sheep</b> keds, <b>nose</b> bots, <b>sheep</b> itch mites, and maggots. Keds are blood-sucking parasites that cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal. Maggots are those of the bot fly and the blow-fly. Fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of flystrike. Flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool; when the maggots hatch they burrow into a sheep's flesh, eventually causing death if untreated. In addition to other treatments, crutching (shearing wool from a sheep's rump) is a common preventive method. Some countries allow mulesing, a practice that involves stripping away the skin on the rump to prevent fly-strike, normally performed when the sheep is a lamb. [...] <b>Nose</b> bots are <b>fly</b> larvae that inhabit a sheep's sinuses, causing breathing difficulties and discomfort. Common signs are a discharge from the nasal passage, sneezing, and frantic movement such as head shaking. External parasites may be controlled through the use of backliners, sprays or immersive sheep dips.|$|R

40|$|Cutaneous myiasis (flystrike), in Australia caused {{primarily}} by Lucilia cuprina [Diptera: Calliphoridae], is a debilitating, painful and potentially lethal disease of sheep. Early detection of flystrike {{is difficult and}} continual flock surveillance is required to enable timely treatment of struck <b>sheep.</b> Electronic <b>nose</b> technology offers the potential for early and automated detection of flystrike.

Non-linear signal measurement techniques and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to extract signal features and process those features for analysis of categorical separation of odour groups. The results from LDA indicated that the electronic nose accurately distinguished flystrike odour on days 1, 2 and 3 of development from that of dry wool in all experiments (P < 0. 05).

Peak emergence occurred from 10 May - 10 June, and was usually bimodal. The temperature during the larvae departure period had a slight effect (significant only in 1991) on the dropping rate of H. tarandi larvae, and temperature during infection in the preceding summer is therefore supposed to explain the uneven dropping rate. This appeared {{to be due to}} the occurrence of successive periods of infection caused by separate periods of weather that were favourable for mass attacks by the flies.

In the autumn of 1995 and 1996 all reindeer {{on the island of}} Silda (42 km 2) were treated with ivermectin in an attempt to eradicate the warble fly (Hypoderma (=Oedemagena) tarandi (L.)), the <b>nose</b> bot <b>fly</b> (Cephenemyia trompe (Modeer)) (Diptera: Oestridae) and the sinus worm (Linguatula arctica Riley, Haugerud and Nilssen) (Pentastomida: Linguatulidae). Silda is situated 2 - 3 km off the mainland of Finnmark, northern Norway, and supports about 475 reindeer in summer. A year after the first treatment, the mean abundance of H. tarandi was reduced from 3. 5 to 0. 6, but a year after the second treatment the mean abundance unexpectedly had increased to 4. 5. After one year without treatment, the mean abundance and prevalence of the three target parasites were at the same level, or higher, than pre-treatment levels. The main hypothesis for the failure to eliminate the parasites is that gravid H. tarandi and C. trompe females originating from untreated reindeer in adjacent mainland areas dispersed to the island during the warm summer of 1997 (possibly also in 1998). As these oestrids are strong flyers, it may not be too difficult for them to cross &gt; 2 - 3 km of oceanic waters.

40|$|SummaryIn {{deceptive}} pollination, {{insects are}} bamboozled into performing nonrewarded pollination. A prerequisite for the evolutionary stability in such systems {{is that the}} plants manage to generate a perfect sensory impression of a desirable object in the insect nervous system [1]. The study of these plants can provide important insights into sensory preference of their visiting insects. Here, we present the first description of a deceptive pollination system that specifically targets drosophilid flies. We show that the examined plant (Arum palaestinum) accomplishes its deception through olfactory mimicry of fermentation, a strategy that represents a novel pollination syndrome. The lily odor is composed of volatiles characteristic of yeast, and produces in Drosophila melanogaster an antennal detection pattern similar to that elicited by a range of fermentation products. By functional imaging, we show that the lily odors target a specific subset of odorant receptors (ORs), which include the most conserved OR genes in the drosophilid olfactome. Furthermore, seven of eight visiting drosophilid species show a congruent olfactory response pattern to the lily, in spite of comprising species pairs separated by ∼ 40 million years [2], showing that the lily targets a basal function of the <b>fly</b> <b>nose,</b> shared by species with similar ecological preference...|$|R

Groups {{of six to}} seven lambs per breed were allocated to pastures of a size allowing ad libitum intake on the following four vegetation types: (i) species-poor and nutrient-rich lowland (400  m a. s. l.) ryegrass–clover ley on flat terrain (‘lowland-rich’); (ii) alpine, species-rich and nutrient-rich vegetation type on a flat terrain (1950  m; ‘alpine-rich’); (iii) alpine, species-rich vegetation type, moderate in nutrients on steep terrain (2150  m; ‘alpine-moderate’); and (iv) alpine, species-rich and nutrient-poor vegetation type on steep terrain (2150  m; ‘alpine-poor’). Lambs were slaughtered after 9 weeks of grazing in a commercial slaughterhouse. Carcasses were subjected to the Swiss CH-TAX classification grid. Meat quality was analysed on the Musculus longissimus dorsi (LD) in the segment of Musculus longissimus lumborum. Forage quality varied among vegetation types as anticipated. Across all sites, ES were superior (P< 0. 001) to VS in dressing percentage (43. 9 vs. 38. 4), carcass weight (18. 4 vs. 16. 4  kg), meat conformation and fat cover scores, even though daily gains had been lower (105 vs. 122  g/d; P< 0. 05). Meat of ES contained more dry matter, protein, total ash (P< 0. 001) and fat (P< 0. 05). Their meat was darker and more intensive red, had lower cooking losses (23. 0 vs. 25. 1 %) but was less tender (65. 6 vs. 58. 1  N) compared to VS (P< 0. 001). Vegetation types offering good quality forage (lowland-rich and alpine-rich) enhanced average daily gains, dressing percentage, meat conformation and fat cover scores (mostly P< 0. 05 against alpine-moderate and -poor). Similarly, a higher vegetation quality promoted a higher intramuscular fat and lower cooking losses. Meat from lowland-rich was darkest and had the lowest shear force (P< 0. 05). Almost no breed×site interactions occurred in growth performance as well as carcass and meat quality. It was therefore concluded that both breeds are similarly well adapted to the extensive pasture production system in alpine regions. Still, ES {{seem to be the}} more efficient one of the two sheep breeds. The results also indicate that growth performance and meat quality clearly vary between vegetation types in animals grazing alpine pastures...|$|R
40|$|The special {{quality of}} foods from alpine grazing systems {{concerning}} their fatty acid (FA) composition is well established. However, {{the contribution of}} different specific vegetationtypes and the animal’s genotype to this alpine effect is still unclear. In the present study,the FA profiles of muscle and adipose tissue lipids were determined in lambs that hadgrazed either an intensively managed lowland pasture or one of three characteristic alpinevegetation types differing in plant species number and composition, forage quality andamount, and composition of phenolic compounds and FA. On each vegetation type and intwo subsequent years, two groups of lambs (seven Engadine sheep, ES; and seven ValaisianBlack <b>Nose</b> <b>sheep,</b> VS) grazed for 9 weeks and were subsequently slaughtered (total n = 110 lambs). Forage samples, meat (Longissimus dorsi muscle, LD) and perirenal adipose tissuewere analysed for their FA composition. Forages were additionally analysed for contentsof phenolic compounds. Although proportions of a-linolenic acid (C 18 : 3 n- 3) and linoleicacid (C 18 : 2 n- 6) in plant biomass were clearly higher in the lowland compared to the alpinevegetation, the proportions of these FA were increased in the adipose tissue of alpine graz-ing sheep by 20 – 87 % and by 26 – 58 % in muscle compared to lowland grazing, dependingon the alpine vegetation type. The levels of these two FA in body tissues differed betweenlambs having grazed different alpine pastures and were clearly positively associated withthe contents of phenolic compounds in the vegetation but not with its lipid composition. Compared to the lowland pasture, conjugated linoleic acid (C 18 : 2 c 9 t 11) in the tissues waslower when the lambs grazed alpine pastures, but did not differ between the alpine vegeta-tion types. Slight breed differences were found, with a trend for higher proportions of longchain polyunsaturated FA at cost of saturated and monounsaturated FA in the VS comparedto the ES. In conclusion, vegetation type {{is an important factor}} determining the FA com-position in lamb meat and differentiating the alpine effect in this respect. The data clearlysuggest that the plant secondary compounds in the swards prevented part of C 18 : 3 n- 3 andC 18 : 2 n- 6 from being hydrogenated in the rumen. Tissue-specific differences in incorporation of C 18 : 2 n- 6 and C 18 : 3 n- 3 point to a physiological optimum level in the muscle but notin the adipose tissue...|$|R
