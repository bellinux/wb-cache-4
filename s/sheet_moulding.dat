50|$|Before the {{invention}} of continuous paper making, paper was made in individual sheets by stirring a container of pulp slurry and either pouring it into a fabric sieve called a <b>sheet</b> <b>mould</b> or dipping and lifting the <b>sheet</b> <b>mould</b> from the vat. While still on the fabric in the <b>sheet</b> <b>mould,</b> the wet paper is pressed to remove excess water and then the sheet is lifted off to be hung over a rope or wooden rod to air dry. In 1799, Louis-Nicolas Robert of Essonnes, France, was granted a patent for a continuous paper making machine. At the time Robert was working for Saint-Léger Didot, with whom he quarrelled over the ownership of {{the invention}}. Didot thought that England was {{a better place to}} develop the machine. But during the troubled times of the French Revolution, he could not go there himself, so he sent his brother-in-law, John Gamble, an Englishman living in Paris. Through a chain of acquaintances, Gamble was introduced to the brothers Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier, stationers of London, who agreed to finance the project. Gamble was granted British patent 2487 on 20 October 1801.|$|R

40|$|Fibre-reinforced polymer {{composites}} {{are being}} widely adopted as {{the de facto}} material for automotive lightweight design, but lack the material models capable of accurately predicting fracture. To address this research gap, three large-scale experimental studies are undertaken to characterize thermoset polymers during cure, understand the fibre-matrix interfacial bond strength, and predict the fracture of random long-fibre composites via the energy of fracture. In conjunction with the Fraunhofer Project Center in London, Ontario, sample <b>sheet</b> <b>moulded</b> composites were used to verify the key findings with several industrial composite samples. With refined interfacial strength measurement methods, and accurate predictions of the composite residual strength, the fracture toughness of composites has been more accurately determined than previous research. These improvements directly translate to improved material and fracture models for fibre reinforced polymer composites. It is thus determined that utilizing the interfacial strength of a composite, failure can be predicted with increased confidence...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of {{investigation}} of micro- and nanoscale degradation of a <b>sheet</b> <b>moulded</b> composite exposed to simulated solar radiation.

Additionally, the typically used macroscopic investigations, such as wettability and flexural strength, were performed to observe the impact of weathering process. It was also shown that high resolution techniques provide superior sensitivity of the material degradation detection. The particular effectiveness of the applied approach was related to the structure of investigated material, as due to its degradation, a number of voids appeared, causing a significant roughness increase.

40|$|Two two-bay {{pultruded}} {{glass fibre}} reinforced polymer (GFRP) post and rail safety barriers have been fabricated. One, a modular barrier, was fabricated from circular cross-section tubes, bolted <b>sheet</b> <b>moulded</b> composite (SMC) two-part multi-way connectors and bases. The other, a custom barrier, was fabricated from three profiles: square cross-section tubular posts, a circular cross-section tubular knee rail and a C-section hand rail. Rivets connected the hand rail to {{the tops of}} the posts and bolted bases connected the posts to the foundation. The continuous knee rail was located by means of holes in the posts’ walls. Both barriers were loaded incrementally up to the general duty load applied to the hand rail and then unloaded. Their load–deformation responses were monitored and both barriers were able to support the general duty load undamaged. After unloading the maximum residual deflection of the hand rail was about 5 mm. The barriers’ mean transverse stiffnesses were evaluated and the custom barrier’s stiffness was about 46 % greater than that of the modular barrier. The custom barrier was re-tested up to the heavy duty load and was able to support the load without visible signs of damage...|$|R
5000|$|November 1982 {{brought the}} first {{facelift}} for the Delta. The bumpers were changed from three-piece <b>sheet</b> <b>moulded</b> compound to one-piece thermoplastic polymer, the front one was redesigned {{with a more}} prominent lower spoiler; another aerodynamic addition was a flat body-colour spoiler applied to the rear part of the roof. Other changes included the deletion of the anodised fascia between the rear tail lights and a 40 kg weight reduction on all models. Inside there were new seats and, on the range topping models, an optional digital trip computer.Concurrently the Delta GT 1600 was launched, the car's first sporting variant. It was powered by a 1585 cc, 105 PS twin-cam engine with Marelli Digiplex ignition; lower profile tyres, retuned suspensions and disk brakes on all four wheels completed the package. Standard equipment was the richest available and some optionals like air conditioning were exclusive to the GT; the cabin was upholstered in Zegna cloth. Outside details like a [...] "GT" [...] badge {{on the right side}} of the grille, matte black door handles and window trim distinguished it from other Deltas. As the 5-speed 1500, 4-speed 1300 and LX versions were dropped — the latter only to be reintroduced in April 1984 on the 1300 LX, with revised equipment—the range was now composed of three models.On 9 March 1984 the 200,000th Delta left the Chivasso factory.|$|R

The tools or moulds are closed tools and are being clamped using a hydraulic press.

50|$|The {{car that}} would become the Delta during its {{development}} went by the project codename Y 5, was conceived as an upmarket front-wheel drive small family car positioned below the larger Beta; an offering around four meters in length had been absent from Lancia's lineup since {{the demise of the}} Fulvia Berlina in 1973.Design was by Giorgetto Giugiaro's Italdesign. Its platform put together MacPherson suspension developed for the Beta with four-cylinder, SOHC engines derived from the Fiat Ritmo. The Fiat engines were revised by Lancia engineers with a Weber twin-choke carburettor, a new inlet manifold, exhaust system and ignition. To achieve its market positioning the Delta offered features uncommon in the segment, as fully independent suspension, rack and pinion steering, available air conditioning, optional split-folding rear seat, height-adjustable steering wheel, and defogger.

In the same manner competences in new production technologies have been built up in the aerospace industry. However, current processes for producing lightweight composites with an excellent mechanical performance cause high costs and long process cycles in comparison with approved metal processes. Furthermore the used raw materials, such as carbon fibres and resin, are very expensive.
