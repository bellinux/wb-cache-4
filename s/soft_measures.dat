6000|$|But these men, Lentulus, Cethegus, and {{the other}} Senators, though they had not dared to sit near Catiline in the Senate, or to speak a word to him, went about their work zealously when evening had come. A report was spread among the people that the Consul had taken upon himself to drive a citizen into exile. Catiline, the ill-used Catiline--Catiline, the friend of the people, had, they said, gone to Marseilles in order that he might escape the fury of the tyrant Consul. In this we see the jealousy of Romans as to the infliction of any {{punishment}} by an individual officer on a citizen. It was with a full knowledge of what was likely to come that Cicero had ironically declared that he only advised the conspirator to go. The feeling {{was so strong that}} on the next morning he found himself compelled to address the people on the subject. Then was uttered the second Catiline oration, which was spoken in the open air to the citizens at large. Here too there are words, among those with which he began his speech, almost as familiar to us as the [...] "Quousque tandem"--"Abiit; excessit; evasit; erupit!" [...] This Catiline, says Cicero, this pest of his country, raging in his madness, I have turned out of the city. If you like it better, I have expelled him by my very words. [...] "He has departed. He has fled. He has gone out from among us. He has broken away!" [...] "I have made this conspiracy plain to you all, as I said I would, unless indeed there may be some one here who does not believe that the friends of Catiline will do the same as Catiline would have done. But there is no time now for <b>soft</b> <b>measures.</b> We have to be strong-handed. There is one thing I will do for these men. Let them too go out, so that Catiline shall not pine for them. I will show them the road. He has gone by the Via Aurelia. If they will hurry they may catch him before night." [...] He implies by this that the story about Marseilles was false. Then he speaks with irony of himself as that violent Consul who could drive citizens into exile by the very breath of his mouth. [...] "Ego vehemens ille consul qui verbo cives in exsilium ejicio." [...] So he goes on, in truth defending himself, but leading them with him {{to take part in the}} accusation which he intends to bring against the chief conspirators who remain in the city. If they too will go, they may go unscathed; if they choose to remain, let them look to themselves.|$|E

Trumpington remained a principled opponent of <b>soft</b> <b>measures</b> on crime. Consistently supportive of tough measures she was appointed Trustee of Crimestoppers in 2004. This tied in closely with ongoing visitations to Pentonville as Crimstoppers emphasis was specific to schoolchildren and youth offending.

The analyses showed that several <b>soft</b> <b>measures</b> against railway suicides were already implemented in European countries and worldwide. <b>Soft</b> <b>measures</b> are often {{a part of a}} more general suicide prevention programme. <b>Soft</b> <b>measures</b> against railway suicide included the design and placement of signage and posters in a railway environment, advertising crisis hotlines, mass media campaigns and media guidelines or local prevention campaigns, intervention at schools and provision of educational materials, briefing of station staff or security personnel, announcement in trains and at stations, gatekeeper programmes and hotspot analysis and education. In particular, the analysis showed that: (1) awareness raising programmes were implemented in five European countries media approaches in six; (2) help lines were offered and operated in many countries, but only in five countries the information about the hotline was displayed in a railway environment; (3) poster campaigns were also launched in five countries; (4) suicide hotspots were officially identified in nine of the countries but only five reported that actions have been taken at the identified sites; (5) ten countries had special announcement to passengers waiting on stations and in trains and even though all countries avoided using the word “suicide”; (6) the gatekeeper programme was only implemented in Great Britain but several different European countries were planning to set up gatekeeper programmes for frontline staff.|$|E

40|$|Most Relevant Explanation (MRE) is {{a method}} for finding multivariate {{explanations}} for given evidence in Bayesian networks [12]. This paper studies the theoretical properties of MRE and develops an algorithm for finding multiple top MRE solutions. Our study shows that MRE relies on an implicit <b>soft</b> relevance <b>measure</b> in automatically identifying the most relevant target variables and pruning less relevant variables from an explanation. The <b>soft</b> <b>measure</b> also enables MRE to capture the intuitive phenomenon of explaining away encoded in Bayesian networks. Furthermore, our study shows that the solution space of MRE has a special lattice structure which yields interesting dominance relations among the solutions. A K-MRE algorithm based on these dominance relations is developed for generating a set of top solutions that are more representative. Our empirical results show that MRE methods are promising approaches for explanation in Bayesian networks.

The research presented enhances the conceptual framework of performance measures for business incubation proposed by Voisey et al (2006). Following an extensive review of the literature, data were collected using a survey of 43 incubatees and interviews with {{a random sample of}} 12 of them. The survey questionnaire examined data in two categories: hard and <b>soft</b> <b>measures</b> – the former relating to sales turnover, profitability, growth, independence and the number of clients, and the latter to professionalism, improved business skills, confidence, productivity, knowledge, cost savings and publicity. The interviews explored the incubatees’ experience of life in a business incubation centre and of networking with other incubatees. The findings indicate that the measurement of business incubation outcomes needs to be broader than a set of statistical outputs. A modified version of the framework proposed by Voisey et al provides an appropriate holistic approach to evaluating business incubation outcomes. The framework proposed includes hard and <b>soft</b> <b>measures</b> and the measurement of outcomes at three stages: pre-incubation, during incubation and post-incubation. This study offers an example of a measurement approach that captures the value of business incubation, and thus should be useful to incubators, sponsors, incubatees and academics...|$|E

It is submitted that to date, the Union has made but a very restricted use of its powers to develop the social dimension of its Single Market, which contributes to the difficulties in reconciling social and labour rights with competition law and economic freedoms. This problem is ascribed not exclusively to the commonly blamed inequality of arms resulting from the prevalence of <b>soft</b> <b>measures</b> in the area of social policy and the hard law regulatory framework for the implementation of the Single Market rules.

A combination of <b>soft</b> and hard <b>measures</b> is required for flood mitigation, although due to resource constrain, the efforts are mostly restricted to <b>soft</b> <b>measure.</b> Community-based initiatives are found to be more effective in most of the developing countries in Asia, with specific focus on empowerment of local communities, and link the community based activities to local development policies.
