40|$|PURPOSE. To {{present a}} novel and {{minimally}} invasive approach to intraocular pressure (IOP) monitoring {{based on a}} <b>sensing</b> <b>contact</b> lens. METHODS. The key element of this measurement method is a soft contact lens with an embedded microfabricated strain gauge allowing the measurement of changes in corneal curvature correlated to variations in IOP. A prototype of this <b>sensing</b> <b>contact</b> lens was adapted and tested on enucleated porcine eyes. To verify the measurement principle of the device, the posterior chamber of the pig eyes was cannulated and connected to a syringe pump and a pressure sensor for precise control of IOP. The measurements of the contact lens were then compared to the ones from the pressure sensor, while pressure variations were induced through the cannula. RESULTS. Enucleated porcine eyes were stimulated with increasing and decreasing ramps of IOP. Measurements from the <b>sensing</b> <b>contact</b> lens and from the pressure sensor showed very good correlation, proving the high potential of this new measurement principle. In this study, a typical signal from the <b>sensing</b> <b>contact</b> lens obtained during the experiments is presented and discussed. CONCLUSIONS. The <b>sensing</b> <b>contact</b> lens shows the potential for continuously monitoring IOP in enucleated porcine eyes. The ultimate step will be the validation {{of the system and}} the reproducibility of results in humans. The device is placed {{in the same way as}} a corrective contact lens, no anesthesia is required, and vision remains almost unimpaired. This device would allow minimally invasive IOP monitoring over prolonged periods, regardless of the patient's position and activity, thus opening up new diagnostic and therapeutic methods for the management of glaucoma...|$|R

Second, the common contact models between an object and a dexterous hand are classied according to the dimension of force/motion constraints imposed by each type of contact.

40|$|International audienceA {{real-time}} {{attitude stabilization}} control scheme is {{proposed for the}} efficient performance of a mini-UAV Quad-Rotor. Brushless DC (BLDC) motor <b>speed</b> <b>sensing</b> is performed by reflective sensors {{in order to obtain}} a robust stabilization of the vehicle in hovering mode both indoor and outdoor. The speed measurement has the advantage of introducing this state information directly in the closed loop control which should be very useful for achieving robust stabilization of the mini-UAV. Furthermore a stabilizing control strategy based on Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) is proposed. The control scheme contains two control loops. The inner loop is devoted to control the motors speed while the outer loop is devoted to control the attitude stabilization of a mini-UAV. Assuming that the motors can be considered as a disturbance of the system, then by the standard singular perturbation theory, we may conclude that the system is asymptotically stable. Finally, to verify the satisfactory performance of proposed embedded controller, simulations and experimental results of <b>speed</b> <b>sensing</b> feedback in BLDC motors of the Quad-rotor aircraft in the presence of disturbances are presented...|$|R
40|$|In Phase I of the Non-Intrusive Speed Sensor program, a {{computerized}} literature search {{was performed to}} identify candidate technologies for remote, non-intrusive <b>speed</b> <b>sensing</b> applications in Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) turbopumps. The three most promising technologies were subjected to experimental evaluation to quantify their performance characteristics under the harsh environmental requirements within the turbopumps. Although the infrared and microwave approaches demonstrated excellent cavitation immunity in laboratory tests, the variable-source magnetic speed sensor emerged as the most viable approach. Preliminary design of this speed sensor encountered no technical obstacles and resulted in viable and feasible speed nut, sensor housing, and sensor coil designs. Phase II of this program developed the variable-source magnetic speed sensor through the detailed design task and guided the design into breadboard fabrication. The speed sensor and its integral speed nut were evaluated at both unit and system level testing. The final room-temperature and cryogenic spin testing of the hardware demonstrated that the sensor was capable of generating sufficient output signal to enable remote <b>speed</b> <b>sensing</b> from 1500 to 40000 rpm over a speed nut/sensor separation of 3. 5 inches...|$|R

40|$|Since Greenwood and Woods' (1919) {{study in}} {{tendency}} of accident, many researchers {{have insisted that}} various human factors (sensation seeking, anger, anxiety) are highly correlated with reckless driving and traffic accidents. Oh and Lee (2011) designed the Driving Behavior Determinants Questionnaire, a psychological tool to predict danger level of drivers and discriminate them into three groups (normal, unintentionally reckless, and intentionally reckless) by their characteristics, attitude, and expected reckless behavior level.

Twenty-four young drivers were requested to react to the visual stimuli (tests for subjective <b>speed</b> <b>sense,</b> simple visual reaction time, and left turning at own risk). The results showed no differences in subjective <b>speed</b> <b>sense</b> among the driver groups, which means drivers' excessive speeding behaviors occur due to intention based on personality and attitude, not because of sensory disorders.
