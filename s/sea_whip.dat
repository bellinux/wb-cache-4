50|$|The regal sea fan {{is part of}} a biodiverse reef community. Amphipods such as Ericthonius brasiliensis {{are often}} found {{climbing}} on the branches which provide them with an elevated position from which to feed. The skeleton shrimp (Caprella equilibra) grasps the sea fan with its posterior appendages and resembles a bit of attached seaweed. The <b>sea</b> <b>whip</b> slug (Tritonia wellsi) feeds on the soft tissues of the sea fan. It is difficult to detect because it is disguised by having numerous small appendages called cerata which closely resemble the sea fan polyps. Another well disguised predator is the <b>sea</b> <b>whip</b> shrimp (Neopontonides beaufortensis).|$|E

5|$|Corals are {{classified}} in the class Anthozoa of the phylum Cnidaria. They are divided into three subclasses, Hexacorallia, Octocorallia, and Ceriantharia. The Hexacorallia include the stony corals, the sea anemones and the zoanthids. These groups have polyps that generally have 6-fold symmetry. The Octocorallia include blue coral, soft corals, sea pens, and gorgonians (sea fans and <b>sea</b> <b>whips).</b> These groups have polyps with 8-fold symmetry, each polyp having eight tentacles and eight mesenteries. Ceriantharia are the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|R

50|$|Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae is a gorgonian octocoral {{found in}} the Caribbean Sea {{in the shape of}} a sea plume (also called a <b>sea</b> <b>whip).</b> It resides from depths of 25 m to 30 m, often at reef drop-offs. It looks like a plume of {{feathery}} appendages with radial symmetry. The branches of P. elisabethae are pinnate and distichous, and will orient themselves in the direction of the ocean current. It ranges in size from 0.3 m to 2 m. It is considered commercially important as it is harvested for analgesics and cosmetic creams. The compound that is believed to cause its beneficial effects is Pseudopterosin A, a diterpene glycoside, a selective analgesic. P. elisabethae is also used in fish tanks as a part of the commercial pet industry. The species has a Least Concern conservation status.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{biological}} and physical stimuli {{have been evaluated}} as inducers of pseudopterosin biosynthesis in the <b>sea</b> <b>whip</b> Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the spatio-temporal distribution, population biology, and diet of the puffer fish Lagocephalus laevigatus in Caraguatatuba Bay, south-eastern Brazil. Monthly samples were taken between August 2003 and October 2004 by trawls in two areas, south and north, at depths of 1 to 4 m. The fish were measured and their sex and reproductive stage determined. The abundance {{of this species}} was compared between areas and among months, and {{the items in the}} diet were identified and quantified. Lagocephalus laevigatus was rare in Caraguatatuba Bay, where only 199 small individuals (4. 8 to 15. 4 cm) were obtained in the entire study period, suggesting that this species uses the estuary as a nursery. None of the specimens of L. laevigatus captured in Caraguatatuba Bay were sexually mature. Higher densities of L. laevigatus in the bay were recorded in the south area and between October and December 2003, i. e. in the spring, suggesting that spawning may occur from late winter to spring (August through to November). The diet items consumed by L. laevigatus in Caraguatatuba Bay were, as expected from the current literature, crustaceans, mainly amphipods, and fish. However, the most-consumed item was the <b>sea</b> <b>whip</b> Leptogorgia setacea (Cnidaria). This feeding habit {{may be related to the}} presence of toxins (tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin) that are frequently found in the skin and viscera of L. laevigatus, which may be sequestered from the <b>sea</b> <b>whip,</b> which possibility still needs to be specifically evaluated.
