40|$|In {{response}} to tuberculosis (TB) outbreaks in the United States {{in the late}} 1980 s and early 1990 s, U. S. hospitals spent tremendous resources to ensure a safer workplace. A remarkable decrease in nosocomial transmission resulted, along with a decrease in TB cases nationally. Federal standards have been promulgated to ensure a safer work environment for all U. S. workers potentially exposed to TB. However, these measures may prove costly and burdensome and thus may compromise the ability to deliver care. A consensus that caring for patients with tuberculosis (TB) posed a risk to health-care workers did not emerge until the 1950 s and 1960 s, when studies established that Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was transmitted by the airborne route (1). However, occupational transmission received little attention until numerous outbreaks of TB and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) occurred in U. S. and European hospitals in the 1980 s and 1990 s (2). More than 20 health-care workers became ill with MDRTB, and at least 10 died (3). Hundreds of health-care workers may be latently infected with MDRTB and thus represent a large repository at risk for future reactivation of disease. Thus, although the MDRTB and drug-sensitive TB outbreaks in the United States and Europe have largely been controlled, the consequences of these outbreaks are still being felt. This article reviews current approaches to TB control in hospitals and prospects for improved control. General Considerations Efficient control of nosocomial TB is compromised by the same difficulties complicating community control, including an insensitive, slow method of diagnosing active disease; an insensitive, nonspecific method of diagnosing latent disease; and relatively slow-acting, complicated courses of medical therapy. However, enormous strides in hospital TB control were made during the late 1980 s and 1990 <b>s</b> <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>common</b> sense, trial and error, and published guidelines (4 - 6). Most U. S. hospitals now have TB control programs adequate to deal with current TB levels. Should another epidemic occur, however, these approaches may prove insufficient, as in the mid- 1980 s when the AIDS epidemic introduced a new group {{at high risk for}} active TB...|$|E
