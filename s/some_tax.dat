5|$|The 2011 Minnesota state {{government}} shutdown was a government shutdown affecting the U.S. state of Minnesota. The shutdown {{was the result}} of a fiscal dispute between the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) Governor Mark Dayton and the Republican-majority Minnesota Legislature, that was not resolved by the constitutional deadline on June 30. The Republican caucuses and their leaders demanded bigger spending cuts, and for the budget shortfall to be met without tax increases, while Dayton demanded <b>some</b> <b>tax</b> increases. The shutdown started at midnight on July 1, and ended after a budget bill was passed and signed on July 20.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{experienced}} <b>some</b> <b>tax</b> {{trouble with}} federal authorities, concerning the financial relationship {{between himself and}} his company. In November 1918, he contracted with the company {{for the use of}} his trade secrets in the manufacture of the coffee, and a month later gave a four-fifths stake in this to his immediate family. The Washingtons insisted that taxes needn't be paid on the family members' income, and the case went first to the Board of Tax Appeals, and then to the Court of Appeals, which in 1927 ruled against the Washingtons by a two-to-one decision. A petition to the Supreme Court was not accepted.|$|E
5|$|Ahmad ibn Tulun, a Turkish soldier, {{had managed}} to become {{governor}} of Egypt in 868. By using the country's immense wealth to raise an army of his own, and exploiting the instability of the central Abbasid government, over the next years he became de facto autonomous, although he continued to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Abbasid caliph—for most of his reign the powerless al-Mu'tamid—and to forward <b>some</b> <b>tax</b> revenue to the central government. Ibn Tulun's power made him a major rival to the real power behind the Abbasid throne, al-Mu'tamid's brother and regent al-Muwaffaq. The latter tried in 877 to wrest Egypt from Ibn Tulun, but the attempt failed spectacularly, and {{in the following year}} Ibn Tulun extended his area of control over Syria up to the border zone with the Byzantine Empire in the north and up to Raqqa in the western Jazira in the east, immediately adjacent to the Abbasid metropolitan province of Iraq.|$|E
50|$|In the Middle Ages <b>some</b> <b>taxes</b> {{were paid}} collectively by the community.

5|$|On March 18, 1653, the {{mediating}} Catholic central Swiss cantons {{proposed in}} Lucerne {{a resolution that}} fulfilled most of the peasants' demands, especially the fiscal ones. In Bern, a similar compromise was proposed by a Protestant delegation from Zürich {{under the direction of}} the mayor of Zürich, Johann Heinrich Waser, on April 4, 1653. The Bernese Emmental and most of the districts of the canton of Lucerne accepted these resolutions and their representatives swore new oaths of fealty. But the people in the Entlebuch valley did not accept the authorities' terms, as these—besides offering <b>some</b> <b>tax</b> reliefs—criminalized the insurrection and called for the punishment of the leaders. At a meeting at Signau on April 10, 1653, the delegates from the Entlebuch convinced their neighbours in the Emmental: the assembly decided not to honor the new oaths its representatives had sworn in Bern.|$|E

25|$|While tax rules vary widely, {{there are}} certain basic {{principles}} common to most income tax systems. Tax systems in Canada, China, Germany, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States, among others, follow most of the principles outlined below. <b>Some</b> <b>tax</b> systems, such as India, may have significant differences from the principles outlined below.

25|$|Because {{the federal}} Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) {{controls}} most employee benefits provided by private employers, DOMA removed <b>some</b> <b>tax</b> breaks for {{employers and employees}} {{in the private sector}} when it comes to health care, pension, and disability benefits to same-sex spouses on an equal footing with opposite-sex spouses. ERISA does not affect employees of state and local government or churches, nor does it extend to such benefits as employee leave and vacation.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} led by Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt from 1999 to 2007 {{achieved a}} balanced budget, <b>some</b> <b>tax</b> reforms, a labour-market reform, scheduled nuclear phase-out and instigated legislation allowing more stringent war crime and more lenient soft drug usage prosecution. Restrictions on withholding euthanasia were reduced and same-sex marriage legalized. The government promoted active diplomacy in Africa and opposed {{the invasion of}} Iraq. It {{is the only country}} that does not have age restrictions on euthanasia.|$|E
25|$|In 1653, peasants of territories {{subject to}} Lucerne, Bern, Solothurn, and Basel revolted because of {{currency}} devaluation. Although the authorities prevailed in this Swiss peasant war, they did pass <b>some</b> <b>tax</b> reforms and {{the incident in}} the long term prevented an absolutist development as would occur at some other courts of Europe. The confessional tensions remained, however, and erupted again in the First War of Villmergen, in 1656, and the Toggenburg War (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712.|$|E

50|$|The {{town was}} {{chartered}} in 1210, {{when it was}} granted the title of ‘free town’. This effectively gave it a charter with certain privileges: perhaps exemption from <b>some</b> <b>taxes</b> or exemption from ecclesiastical territorial sovereignty.

50|$|The {{success of}} the Turkish policy of {{centralization}} was, however, ephemeral. As long as Turkish troops were present in full force, some soldiers could be conscripted and <b>some</b> <b>taxes</b> collected by force. In Kosovo, the Tanzimat reforms could not be carried out until 1860.|$|R
25|$|Under Washington and Adams the Federalists had {{established}} a strong government, but sometimes it followed policies that alienated the citizenry. For example, in 1798, {{to pay for the}} rapidly expanding army and navy, the Federalists had enacted a new tax on houses, land and slaves, affecting every property owner in the country. In the Fries's Rebellion hundreds of farmers in Pennsylvania revolted—Federalists saw a breakdown in civil society. <b>Some</b> <b>tax</b> resisters were arrested—then pardoned by Adams. Republicans denounced this action as an example of Federalist tyranny.|$|E
25|$|A {{person could}} {{be both a}} tax protester and a tax {{resister}} {{if he or she}} believes that tax laws do not apply to him or her and also believes that taxes should not be paid based on the use to which the taxes are put. <b>Some</b> <b>tax</b> resisters have put forth legal arguments for their position—for instance that they cannot pay taxes for nuclear weapons development because this would put them in violation of the Nuremberg Principles—that could be considered varieties of tax-protester theories.|$|E
25|$|In 1653 {{the largest}} {{uprising}} occurred as peasants of territories subject to Lucerne, Bern, Solothurn and Basel revolted because of currency devaluation. Although the authorities prevailed in this Swiss peasant war, they did pass <b>some</b> <b>tax</b> reforms and {{the incident in}} the long term prevented creation of an absolutist state, unlike many of the other states of Europe. The Confederation remained a decentralised and disorganised country during this era, torn by religious and political conflicts. In 1655 an attempt to create a central administration fell apart after the two proposers, Bern and Zürich, couldn't agree with each other.|$|E

25|$|Most jurisdictions {{imposing}} {{an income}} tax treat capital gains as part of income subject to tax. Capital gain is generally a gain on sale of capital assets—that is, those assets not held {{for sale in the}} ordinary course of business. Capital assets include personal assets in many jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions provide preferential rates of tax or only partial taxation for capital gains. Some jurisdictions impose different rates or levels of capital gains taxation based on the length of time the asset was held. Because tax rates are often much lower for capital gains than for ordinary income, there is widespread controversy and dispute about the proper definition of capital. <b>Some</b> <b>tax</b> scholars have argued that differences in the ways different kinds of capital and investment are taxed contribute to economic distortions.|$|E
25|$|With {{respect to}} the failure to pay U.S. federal income tax, <b>some</b> <b>tax</b> protesters miss the {{distinction}} between civil and criminal liability. A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial for non-payment of income tax does not relieve a defendant of civil liability (i.e., the legal obligation to pay the tax). After a criminal acquittal, the IRS can continue to seek money through levy or other lawful means. Generally, {{the amount of money}} due to the IRS is determined administratively by the IRS, and not in a criminal trial. (The amount of tax may, however, be calculated after the guilty verdict is reached in a criminal case—for purposes of determining the severity of the sentence.) Although there have been several well-publicized cases of acquittal in a criminal tax case, the IRS continues collection efforts, with many defendants finally seeking refuge in bankruptcy court.|$|E
25|$|In October 1964, Conservative Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home (who {{had only}} been in power for 12 months since the {{resignation}} of Harold Macmillan) called a general election. It was a tough election, but Labour won a narrow majority, gaining 56 seats (a total of 317 to the Conservatives' 304). The new Labour government under Harold Wilson immediately faced economic problems and Wilson acted within his first hours to appoint Callaghan as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The new government {{had to cope with}} a balance of payments deficit and speculative attacks on Sterling. It was the policy of the whole government, and one in which Callaghan concurred, that devaluation should be avoided {{for as long as possible}} and he managed to arrange loans from other central banks and <b>some</b> <b>tax</b> rises to stabilise the economy. Callaghan's time as chancellor was to be during a time of crisis; with high inflation, high unemployment and an unstable economy with a deficit in the budget, a deficit in the balance of import and exports and most importantly conflict over the value of the pound.|$|E

5000|$|The Franco regime {{considered}} Biscay and Gipuzkoa as [...] "traitor provinces" [...] and cancelled their fueros. However, the pro-Franco {{provinces of}} Álava and Navarre maintained {{a degree of}} autonomy unknown {{in the rest of}} Spain, with local telephone companies, provincial limited-bailiwick police forces (miñones in Alava, and Foral Police in Navarre), road works and <b>some</b> <b>taxes</b> to support local government.|$|R
50|$|Property tax {{is rarely}} self-computed by the owner. The tax becomes a legally {{enforceable}} obligation attaching {{to the property}} at a specific date.
