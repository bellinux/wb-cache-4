50|$|This {{section was}} {{established}} in 1970 with the aim to conduct basic research on physiology and nutrition of cotton crop.

The scientists of the section try their best to increase cotton production by managing the soil, plant and seed related problems through a coordinated approach. Apart from the allocated experimental area for field trials, the Physiology/Chemistry Section has well equipped laboratories for qualitative and quantitative studies such as pH and EC meters, flame photometers, double beam spectrophotometer, atomic absorption spectrophotometer, ICP, HPLC, GC’s, pressure chamber for leaf water potential, Osmometer, Photosynthesis measuring system, Micro Kjeldahl apparatus, centrifuges, water baths, hot plate, <b>Soxhlet’s</b> <b>apparatus,</b> Muffle furnace and sample grinding machines etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{concerns}} {{raised by}} the toxicological aspects of EC together with the low concentration levels (µg/L) found in wines, {{as well as the}} occurrence of interferences on detection, has motivated several researchers to develop new methods to determine it in wines. Several extraction and chromatographic techniques have been used, including continuous liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) with <b>Soxhlet</b> <b>apparatus,</b> derivatization with 9-xanthydrol followed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection and even LLE after derivatization, followed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS). On the other hand, the reference method set by the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV) uses solid phase extraction (SPE) preceding GC-MS quantification. Other methods also make use of SPE, but use gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (MDGC/MS) and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for detection. Most of the methodologies found in the literature to quantify EC use gas chromatography, using LLE and SPE as extraction techniques. Nevertheless, several efforts have also been done to develop new methodologies to determine EC without using long procedures and hard-working analyses, combining precision to high sensitivity. In this regard, headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) has been gaining great highlighting and alternative methodologies has been proposed using the most recent identification and quantification technology, such as gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS/MS) and two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-ToFMS).|$|E

Group III-VI were test groups also treated with N. sativa aqueous extract (200 and 400 mg/kg p. o) and ethanolic extract (200 and 400 mg/kg p. o), respectively. The treatment was given daily for 7 days and on 8 th all the rats were sacrificed and the blood was analyzed for hepatic and renal function tests and tissue was preserved for histopathological examination. Results: Paracetamol administration caused a marked hepatic and renal damage, which is evidenced by the increase in liver and renal function test parameters in the negative control group.

Traditionally, C. intybus is used for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, but there are only few in vitro studies reporting the anti-inflammatory activity of roots of chicory. Objective: Evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity of roots of chicory and mechanisms involved in it using in vivo models of inflammation. Materials and Methods: Albino Wistar rats of either sex weighing 150 - 200 g were used. Ethanolic and aqueous extracts of roots of chicory were prepared with the help of <b>Soxhlet′s</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The anti-inflammatory activity was studied using carrageenan-induced paw edema method and cotton pellet granuloma method. Levels of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL- 6), and IL- 1 and activity of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were estimated. Results: Chicory roots demonstrated significant dose-dependent decrease in paw edema in carrageenan-induced paw edema method. Chicory roots diminished the serum TNF-α, IL- 6, and IL- 1 levels. They also significantly attenuated the malonylaldehyde levels and increased the activities of CAT and GPx in paw tissue. Similarly, chicory roots demonstrated a significant decrease in granuloma formation in cotton pellet induced granuloma method.

40|$|One {{way for the}} {{rational}} use of natural raw materials and to save forest resources {{is to increase the}} degree of utilization of wood biomass. A solution to this problem is directly related to improving the efficiency of biomass processing, and reducing environmental pollution from industrial waste. Birch in the Northern hemisphere is a very widespread tree genus, which is extensively used in the furniture, pulp and plywood manufacture where, as a by-product, it accumulates birch bark (BB) in the process, which does not find industrial application, and is often burned as fuel. BB comprises about 12. 5 wt. % of the tree mass. Outer BB actually consists of a mixture of pentacyclic triterpenes (35 – 40 wt. %) and biopolyester suberin (45 wt. %) [1]. Betulin, betulinic acid and lupeol, representatives of triterpenes, are biologically active substances, whose efficiency can be enhanced by synthetic modification. Betulin in the outer BB powder form is used in folk-medicine as an anti-inflammatory agent. Its derivative, betulinic acid, features properties, regulating the development of live cells, which transform the metabolism process in malignant tumour cells in the self-annihilation direction. Betulinic acid selectively kills human melanoma cells while leaving healthy cells intact and is found to delay the progression of the HIV 1 infection, which eventually leads to AIDS, by preventing the formation of syncytia [2, 3]. Milled BB (≤ 2 mm) was pelletized on a laboratory flat die type pelletizer with holes of diameter 6 mm. The temperature equilibrium on the die was approximately 100 oC. Extraction of triterpenes was carried out in <b>Soxhlet</b> <b>apparatuses</b> by the selected solvents (ethanol - water mixtures in the range of 75 to 95 vol%, acetone, cyclohexane and heptane) for 1 - 11 h.

The properties and composition of BB were evaluated to gain information for selecting a technology, convenient for obtaining triterpenes. Pelletization increased the outer BB bulk density up to 470 kg/m 3. The yield of cyclohexane and heptane extractives was considerably lower than {{that in the case of}} acetone and ethanol.

It is crucial to note that, {{with the exception of the}} acid value of the germinated sample, peroxide and acid values remained below one meq O 2 /Kg of oil and one mg KOH/g of oil, respectively. The oxidative stability of the oil from the roasted sample was increased almost by 80 % compared to the raw one. Roasting of the kernels prior to oil extraction is imperative for improving its oxidation resistance and the physicochemical characteristics...|$|R
