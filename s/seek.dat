40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses {{data from}} the National Survey of Fertility Barriers (NSFB), a nationally representative sample, to assess factors associated with face-to-face and internet help <b>seeking</b> (study 1) and perceived social support (study 2). In study one, I examine whether the General Help <b>Seeking</b> Model, a theory {{that has been used}} to explain in-person help <b>seeking,</b> generalizes to internet help <b>seeking.</b> I assess four types of help seeking: (1) no help <b>seeking,</b> (2) only internet help <b>seeking,</b> (3) only medical help <b>seeking,</b> and (4) both online and medical help <b>seeking.</b> Results suggest that online help <b>seeking</b> is differentiated from in person help <b>seeking</b> by attitudes towards medical science, infertility stigma, age, income, and educational attainment. In study two I explore whether the type of help <b>seeking</b> that individuals engage in and the types of activities that people do online are associated with perceived social support. Perceived social support does not differ by type of help <b>seeking,</b> nor are the types of online activities associated with perceptions of social support. Finally, I provide descriptive information on patterns of infertility help <b>seeking</b> on the internet â€“ information that is important as the use of the internet for health related activities continues to grow. I show that use of the internet varies by several individual and social characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{costs of}} rent <b>seeking</b> exceed {{traditional}} measures when opportunity cost is considered. When {{the quantity of}} resources consumed by rent <b>seeking</b> is large, rent <b>seeking</b> draws consumer surplus out of alternative resource employments. The costs of rent <b>seeking</b> differ in partial and general equilibrium frameworks; Tullock (1989) recognizes this but incorrectly argues that rent <b>seeking</b> costs are twice as large in general than in partial equilibrium. Other authors suggest that rent <b>seeking</b> costs are lower once the opportunity costs of resources used in rent <b>seeking</b> are considered. We clear up the confusion in the current literature.

40|$|Individuals with {{depression}} {{can engage in}} aversive interpersonal behaviours, such as excessive reassurance <b>seeking</b> and negative feedback <b>seeking,</b> which can themselves be associated with problematic social relationships. Excessive reassurance <b>seeking</b> is characterized by repeatedly <b>seeking</b> information about one's worth or lovability, whereas negative feedback <b>seeking</b> is characterized by repeatedly <b>seeking</b> negative information about oneself that confirms one's negative self-views. There have been few studies to date that look at both of these seemingly irreconcilable behaviours and their relation to depression, and research has yet to fully support an integrative model that links the two {{with depression}}. This study further examined the associations between excessive reassurance <b>seeking,</b> negative feedback <b>seeking,</b> and depression within a clinical sample of 31 participants. Evidence was found for an association between excessive reassurance <b>seeking</b> and depressive symptoms, but no such association was found for negative feedback <b>seeking</b> and depressive symptoms. Perceived rejection fully mediated the association between excessive reassurance <b>seeking</b> and depression, {{but there was no}} evidence to suggest that self-esteem acted as a moderator of the associations between excessive reassurance <b>seeking,</b> negative feedback <b>seeking,</b> perceived rejection, and depressive symptoms. Implications for an integrated model are discussed, as are directions for future research. By understanding more about the associations between these behaviours and clinical depression, interventions can be developed that are aimed at reducing such problematic behaviours.
