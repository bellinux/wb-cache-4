40|$|Students of {{sociology}} often mistakenly think that studying sociology is about learning {{a bunch of}} dusty old theories and memorising a stack of ‘social facts’. While this knowledge is a foundational requirement {{of sociology}}, what <b>sociologists</b> really do is study the social world. When <b>sociologists</b> study the social world in a systematic way, it is called social research. Social research draws both on various theoretical frameworks and also on the studies that other <b>sociologists</b> have conducted. It is the fun part of sociology, and {{while it may be}} a number of years until you conduct your own research projects, throughout your studies you will {{need to be able to}} locate, understand, and critically evaluate the research work of <b>sociologists.</b> The aim of this chapter is provide you with an overview of the social research process. We will consider the impact of the researcher and the place of theory and previous research findings in the research process. This will be followed by a quick overview of research design and how <b>sociologists</b> go about finding the people that they want to research.

40|$|Examining {{the works}} of {{classical}} <b>sociologists,</b> this study demonstrates that the 'socio-cultural network analysis' is a 'process-oriented methodology'. 'Sociocultural network' is a concept originally proposed {{on the basis of}} 'thick comparison' studies conducted of two Thai villages; it includes both cultural elements and social actors. Different from the early classical <b>sociologists</b> (Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer), the later classical <b>sociologists</b> (Georg Simmel, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, Norbert Elias, Talcott Parsons) utilized the terms 'network' and 'process' and thereby prepared the basis for process-oriented methodology. Among them, only Simmel, Weber and Elias created a direct portal to process-oriented methodology by employing those two terms in a significant and interconnected way and in their philosophical, historical and comparative studies. Thus, the socio-cultural network analysis can be regarded as a descendant of these three <b>sociologists.</b> " (author's abstract...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Stimulated by {{debates on}} public {{sociology}} {{in the recent}} years I studied contributions of <b>sociologists</b> in daily newspapers in Austria. Although <b>sociologists</b> are rather present in the Austrian press, I argue this remains without noticeable effects on public opinion formation; the topics <b>sociologists</b> write and talk about are rather arbitrary and they lack factual content. Although my data refers to <b>sociologists</b> in the Austrian press, the study’s conclusions might be true to the wider sociological community: Through such exposure, a public profile of sociology cannot evolve. Furthermore, the article discusses criteria that prevent and complicate the relationship between <b>sociologists</b> and the press: avoidance of publicity, the problem of values and ideology, incompatibilities of language-games, divergence of relevance criteria, and deficient cultural empathy.
