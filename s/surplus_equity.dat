5000|$|In the United States a [...] {{contingent}} surplus note is a bond-like instrument {{issued by}} an insurance company. These securities are subordinated obligations, and {{fall at the}} very bottom of the operating insurance company's capital structure. They are issued primarily by mutual insurance companies, which are not public and owned instead by their policy holders. Surplus notes are debt-like in that they pay a coupon and have a finite maturity. However, in many cases, state insurance regulators have allowed insurance companies to classify the capital raised via surplus notes as “surplus” (which is the statutory equivalent of <b>equity),</b> because <b>surplus</b> note holders are last in line to make a claim on the company's assets in a default scenario, much like where equity holders reside in a public company. The motivation for mutual companies to issue these instruments was to raise <b>surplus</b> (or <b>equity)</b> in response to new risk-based capital guidelines developed in the early 1990s. Because mutual companies are owned by policyholders, not shareholders, there was no alternative method to raise <b>surplus</b> or <b>equity.</b> While <b>surplus</b> note holders have last claim on the assets of the operating insurance company, it is important to realize that this claim is at the operating company level, which is still ahead of holding company obligations.|$|R

50|$|In finance, {{interest}} rate immunization, as developed by Frank Redington {{is a strategy}} that ensures that a change in {{interest rate}}s will not affect {{the value of a}} portfolio. Similarly, immunization can be used to ensure that the value of a pension fund's or a firm's assets will increase or decrease in exactly the opposite amount of their liabilities, thus leaving the value of the pension fund's <b>surplus</b> or firm's <b>equity</b> unchanged, regardless of changes in the interest rate.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Despite its virtues, {{congestion}} pricing {{has yet to}} be widely adopted. This paper explores the issues of equity and use of toll revenue and several possible alternatives. The equity and efficiency problems of conventional (uncompensated) {{congestion pricing}} are outlined. Then, several alternatives are discussed and developed. A new compensation mechanism is developed, called the delayer pays principle. This principle ensures that those who are cause delay to others pay a toll to compensate those who are delayed. We evaluate the effectiveness of this idea by simulating alternative tolling approaches and evaluating the results across several measures, including delay, social cost, consumer <b>surplus,</b> and <b>equity.</b> Different tolling approaches can satisfy widely varying policy objectives, thus this principle is applicable in diverse situations. Such a system is viable and can eliminate some common hurdles of congestion pricing while remaining revenue neutral...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to analyse}} {{the changes in}} {{accounting}} <b>surplus</b> (loss), <b>equity</b> and assets, and liabilities {{as a result of}} accounting policy changes from the Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in Australian local government entities. Using the reconciliation notes disclosed by 117 local government entities, evidence is provided on the effects of IFRS adoption by identifying the key items that of difference between IFRS and AASB. The results show some differences between two sets of accounts prepared under these different accounting standards. While the average surplus (loss) of local councils has decreased, their equities, assets and liabilities have increased, with no major significant changes in their overall financial position, except for liabilities. These results indicate the possible consequences of the adoption of IFRS by local government entities in other countries on performance indicators who have or are yet to implement these standards...|$|R

Building on the Dick and Basu grid, the value of establishing whether a brand exhibits brand <b>equity</b> <b>surplus,</b> deficit or balance is described. The insights that can be gleaned from a single source study with the comparison of share of mind (attitude) with market share (behaviour) and the accompanying diagnostic analysis are explored. The approach has supporting validations across North America and Europe. The value to marketers in terms of brand diagnosis, prognosis and recommended ‘treatment' is described using two case studies...|$|R

The equity and efficiency problems of conventional (uncompensated) congestion pricing are outlined. Then, several alternatives are discussed and developed. A new compensation mechanism is developed, called the "delayer pays " principle. This principle ensures that those who are not delayed but delay others pay a toll to compensate those who are delayed. We evaluate the effectiveness of this idea by simulating alternative tolling schemes and evaluating the results across several measures, including delay, social cost, consumer <b>surplus,</b> and <b>equity.</b> Different tolling schemes can satisfy widely varying policy objectives, thus this principle is applicable in diverse situations. Such a system is viable and can eliminate many disadvantages of congestion pricing – while remaining revenue neutral. Peter Rafferty M. S. Plan B Paper Page...|$|R
40|$|The {{transformation}} from {{cash basis accounting}} to accrual-based accounting in financial reporting of public sector {{is expected to increase}} public accountability of public managers. However, the suitability of accrual-based accounting in the public sector are debatable based on the experience of pioneer countries of accruals. This study explores the perceptions of Malaysian public managers on the applicability of accrual accounting concept in the public sector and the usefulness of accrual-based governmental financial reports towards the public managers in discharging their duties. Besides, this study also highlights the neutral response upon the study. This study finds that there are significant differences between the responses from three different level of government sector on the reporting entity of a consolidated report, the definition and concept of controlled assets by public entities and the use of accumulated <b>surplus</b> and <b>equity</b> as a financial performance indicator. In addition, the study indicates that familiarity and experience over time will contribute to higher perceptions towards the usefulness of accrual-based information. Furthermore, the neutral response from the respondents suggests that an in-depth discussion between the public sector managers and experts from the accounting field to improve the understanding among the Malaysian public sector managers. Hence, this study provides useful insights to the standard setters in the process of MPSAS formulation with regards to the general purpose financial reporting model for the public sector in Malaysia. In addition, it will improve the public accountability practice in Malaysian governmental financial reporting...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} meshing of pension {{politics}} and financial investment in Canada and the U. S. during the 1990 s. Drawing on the institutionalist literature, the paper {{focuses on the}} relationship between ideas, finance and institutional legacies in the debate over the reform of earnings-related pension schemes (Canada/Quebec Pension Plan and Social Security). In Canada, the existence of a public investment board in the province of Quebec facilitated the advent of state financial investment as part of the 1998 reform of the Canada Pension Plan. In the U. S., policy learning [...] the process by which experts and state officials evaluate the performance of previously enacted policies [...] involved mainly a comparison between public and private pension benefits, as the growth of 401 (k) and other savings schemes combined with exceptional stock- market performances stimulated financial optimism and legitimized what is commonly known as pension privatization (diverting contributions to individual savings accounts). As opposed to the situation prevailing in Canada, the idea of investing Social Security <b>surpluses</b> in <b>equity</b> faced overwhelming opposition in the U. S., despite the efforts of President Clinton to promote it, notably in his 1999 State of the Union address. Although pension privatization appeared as the most debated policy alternative in that country, the conjunction of divided government, the lack of trust between the President and the Republican majority in Congress, and the absence of short term "fiscal crisis," prevented the enactment of such a reform. pensions; Social Security; privatization; policy learning; politics...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{creates an}} {{economic}} burden for society by compelling {{the creation of}} reserve funds, raising the cost of certain services and excluding the provision of some goods and services. Because {{of the threat of}} failure and insolvency, the risk of insurance company is closely monitored by managers and regulators. Ever since the 1997 financial crisis that lead to the liberalisation in the insurance industry, monitoring insurers that are in or heading a hazardous condition has created a challenge to the regulatory bodies. Failure on the part of an insurer to give due performance of its obligations can lead to the policyholders losing part of the premiums paid or worse they or the third party may be deprived of any compensation due when claims are made. Capital, also called <b>surplus</b> or <b>equity,</b> is the excess of assets over liabilities. Technical insolvency occurs when obligations exceed assets requiring intervention by the regulators. Solvency of an insurer is intimately linked to the condition of its financial statement. Risk-based capital (RBC) is the theoretical amount of capital needed to absorb the risks of conducting a business. For insurance, it is the amount of capital necessary to assure major parties to insurer insolvency that the danger of failure is acceptably low. Generally, RBC categorises risk into different components to cover the liquidity, asset management and leverage aspects of an insurer. In this study, the risk-based capital is attempted to assess the risk and financial strength of twenty general insurers in Malaysia from the years 2002 to 2004. Our study found that based on RBC about a fifth of the insurers need regulatory interventio...|$|R
40|$|Cancers of {{the upper}} aero-digestive tract (i. e., oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and oesophagus) are largely {{attributable}} to smoking and drinking habits, but the correct estimation of the dose-response relationship between alcohol and cancer risk is challenging. Step functions are widely used to estimate risks and to evaluate trends of continuous exposure. However, results {{are influenced by the}} selection of the reference category and cutpoints. More flexible models, like spline regression and fractional polynomial models, may be an attractive alternative for avoiding strict assumptions about the dose-response relationship. Data from a large series of hospital-based case-control studies conducted in Italy and the Swiss Canton of Vaud in the last 2 decades were reassessed to compare findings from logistic regression spline models and standard step function analysis. For all examined cancers, the risk increased to the consumption of 150 grams of ethanol per day (1. 5 litre/day of wine), with a possible threshold effect emerging for cancer of the pharynx and larynx ( Alcohol Drinking; Ethanol; Neoplasms oai:serval. unil. ch:BIB_A 64 DB 5 F 311 D 4 2017 - 11 - 29 T 16 : 08 : 24 Z [URL] Optimal Dividends in the Dual Model [URL] Avanzi, B.

Su un?impostazione alternativa della teoria collettiva del rischio. In: Transactions of the XVth International Congress of Actuaries, vol. 2. pp. 433 ? 443] is to find the dividend-payment strategy that maximizes the expected discounted value of dividends which are paid to the shareholders until the company is ruined or bankrupt. In this paper, it is assumed that the <b>surplus</b> or shareholders? <b>equity</b> is a Lévy process which is skip-free downwards; such a model might be appropriate for a company that specializes in inventions and discoveries. In this model, the optimal strategy is a barrier strategy. Hence the problem is to determine b*, the optimal level of the dividend barrier. A key tool is the method of Laplace transforms. A variety of numerical examples are provided. It is also shown that if the initial surplus is b*, the expectation of the discounted dividends until ruin is the present value of a perpetuity with the payment rate being the drift of the surplus process...|$|R
