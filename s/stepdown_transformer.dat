The voltage supplied from the aforementioned substations in Newton and Needham enter Wellesley at 13,800 kV and are either distributed through the town at 13.8 kV or, through the substations and <b>stepdown</b> <b>transformers,</b> distributed at 4 kV.|$|R

50|$|In 2006, {{proposal}} {{to build a}} $600 million transmission corridor from the Portlands plant to connect with higher voltage transmission lines north of Toronto was being discussed and opposed by resident and other groups. The transmission system that the R.L Hearn station supplied was a 115 kV network of buried and overhead lines and transformer stations in Toronto. The city has been supplied by <b>stepdown</b> <b>transformer</b> stations from {{the east and west}} since the R. L. Hearn closed, which are becoming overloaded, especially in the summer.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{high-power}} semiconductors such as the {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT), it is now possible to build a switched-mode power supply capable of coping with the high loads of arc welding. These designs are known as inverter welding units. They generally first rectify the utility AC power to DC; then they switch (invert) the DC power into a <b>stepdown</b> <b>transformer</b> to produce the desired welding voltage or current. The switching frequency is typically 10 kHz or higher. Although the high switching frequency requires sophisticated components and circuits, it drastically reduces the bulk of the step down transformer, as the mass of magnetic components (transformers and inductors) that is required for achieving a given power level goes down rapidly as the operating (switching) frequency is increased. The inverter circuitry can also provide features such as power control and overload protection. The high frequency inverter-based welding machines are typically more efficient and provide better control of variable functional parameters than non-inverter welding machines.|$|E
5000|$|In 1962 Young wrote The Second Dream of the High-Tension Line <b>Stepdown</b> <b>Transformer.</b> One of The Four Dreams of China, {{the piece}} is based on four pitches, which he later gave as the {{frequency}} ratios: 36-35-32-24 (G, C, +C#, D), and limits as to which may be combined with any other. Most of his pieces after this point are based on select pitches, played continuously, {{and a group of}} long held pitches to be improvised upon. For The Four Dreams of China Young began to plan Dream House, a light and sound installation conceived as a [...] "work that would be played continuously and ultimately exist as a 'living organism with a life and tradition of its own,'" [...] where musicians would live and create music twenty-four hours a day. He formed the music collective Theatre of Eternal Music to realize Dream House and other pieces. The group initially included calligrapher and light artist Marian Zazeela (who married Young in 1963), Angus MacLise, and Billy Name. In 1964 the ensemble comprised Young and Zazeela, John Cale and Tony Conrad (a former Harvard mathematics major), and sometimes Terry Riley (voices). Since 1966 the group has seen many permutations and has included Garrett List, Jon Hassell, Alex Dea, and many others, including members of the 60s groups.|$|E
