In both economies, the major output gains otherwise come in non-traded services sectors, driven by income effects. We find that trade diversion effects are quite significant; this lends support for the domino theory of major free trade agreements - since the Korea-EU agreement broke the ice, the pressure has intensified on third parties to re-level playing fields by striking their own deals. The study breaks new ground in modelling services trade by developing policy impacts based on the extent to which the text of the Agreement modifies Korea's and Canada's scores on the OECD's Services Trade Restrictiveness Index and by providing estimates of Mode 3 Services trade impacts.

The counter-arguments are, first, that the WTO regime is a self-contained regime and therefore the general principles of international law do not apply in this case, and, second, that the WTO legal system is based on a distinct idea of â€œcomplianceâ€ with WTO rules as a primary remedy, as opposed to reparative and punitive justice. The concept of â€œcomplianceâ€ with WTO rules is akin to the concept of â€œliberalizationâ€, which is a linchpin of the WTO multilateral system.

40|$|Contact {{for this}} paper: Laura Bipes/University of Minnesota/Department of Applied Economics/ 1994 Buford Avenue. / St. Paul, MN 55108 USA. From the start, {{agriculture}} {{played a central}} role in the Uruguay Round of GATT trade negotiations. The Punta del Este Declaration called for a solution to the problems facing agricultural trade through modified trade rules and an agreement to lower protection levels. It was recognized that such an improvement implied negotiations on the national farm policies as well as just trade policies. The time that it took to reach agreement reflected the political sensitivity and technical complexity of this task. The Agreement embodied in the Final Act of the Uruguay Round breaks new ground for agriculture, and takes a big step towards placing this sector of world trade under rules more consistent with those in operation in other areas. However, the degree of liberalization of markets is modest, and much remains to be done in future rounds of negotiations. The most far-reaching element in the Agreement is a change in the rules regarding market access. With very few exceptions, all participating countries have agreed to convert all existing non-tariff barriers (along with unbound tariffs) into bound duties and not to introduce new non-tariff measures. Negotiations agreed to reduce these new bound tariffs, as well as tariffs already bound earlier, according to Schedules included as a part of the Agreement. "Tariffication" will impose changes in import policies for a number of countries. Canada will replace import quotas for dairy and poultry products with tariffs, initially at a high level. The European Union will replace its variable levy with tariffs, though a maximum duty-paid price for cereals has been negotiated which puts a limit on the tariff charged. Latin American countries have generally engaged in tariffication in recent years in advance of the Uruguay Round Agreement: for these, and other countries their tariffs will now be bound. The US will forgo the use of Section 22 import quotas and the negotiation of voluntary export restraint agreements with beef suppliers, but the impact on these markets is likely to be small. Japan and Korea have been allowed to delay tariffication in the case of rice for the next few years. The Agreement provides in cases of tariffication for "minimum access opportunities", to guard against the impact of high initial tariff rates. This will open up reduced-tariff quotas for a number of products including beef, cereals and fruits and vegetables. The quotas will be expanded to about 5 percent of consumption over the 6 year period. Japan and Korea have agreed to a greater expansion of market access for rice in compensation for the delay in introducing tariffs. The ability of countries to control export subsidies in agricultural markets was one of the main issues under discussion in the negotiation. Under the Agreement, countries accept commitments on reducing expenditure on export subsidies as well on the quantity of subsidized exports. This will limit export subsidies by the EU and other countries, for such products as wheat, dairy products and beef, and should lead to firmer world market prices in these commodities. These quantities are also expressed in the Schedules which form part of the Agreement. Countries have also agreed not to apply export subsidies to commodities not subsidized in the base period. The Agreement also sets rules and commitments for domestic support policies. It defines a set of policies which are deemed to be less trade-distorting than others, and allocates them to a "green box" which is broadly immune to challenge. Other policies not sheltered in this way are subject to reduction through a limit on the total support given by domestic subsidies and administered prices. It was decided that neither the U. S. deficiency payments (under current legislation) nor the new hectarage compensation payments under the reformed Common Agricultural Policy of the EU need to be reduced. It was also agreed that subsidies that conform to the new rules are sheltered from international challenge under the GATT. Developing Countries generally face less stringent commitments, having 10 years rather than six to make the changes, and having to meet only two-thirds of the reduction targets. In addition, development policies are included broadly in the "green box". Along with the provisions on domestic and trade policies in the Agreement, participants also concluded an Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement). The goal was to make it easier to distinguish between genuine health and safety issues and disguised protection. The right of countries to set their own safety and health standards is reaffirmed, but with the provision that such standards should be based on scientific justification and that use be made of international standards where possible. The extent to which the Agreement will lead to greater market access, curb export subsidies and modify domestic policies in the next few years can only be determined from a detailed inspection of the <b>Schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitments</b> made by the individual countries. Paradoxically, the immediate impact on national policies is likely in most cases to be small. Many countries have been engaged in a process of reducing government support to agriculture, and making such support more closely targetted to needs, in advance of the outcome of the Round. Policy reforms in the EU, Canada, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand, along with much of Latin America, have been strongly influenced by the negotiations in the Uruguay Round. The Agreement thus takes on the task of supporting and locking-in such reforms, and encouraging them in other countries. In some aspects the Agreement falls short of expectations (or at least initial demands). It does not constitute a major move toward free trade in agricultural products: the cost of changing the rules has been to give up some degree of liberalization. The tariffs which countries will impose in place of non-tariff barriers are in many cases so high that trade will be restricted to the agreed access quantities. Export subsidy programs will continue though at a reduced level. The major pressure to reinstrument farm policies will continue to be from domestic budget constraints. It will take further rounds of negotiations to reduce protection in agricultural markets to a level comparable to that for most manufactured products. However, with the rule changes and the new types of country commitments agreed, a much more promising basis bas been created for future negotiations. International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

To ecognize SACU member states' <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> GATS <b>Commitments,</b> especially in the service sectors being investigated, by improving market access, and to recommend minimal infrastructural development levels to be attained for such sectors' support. To make recommendations to harness the challenges faced by the said industries into a working document. To calibrate a uniformity of trade standards in these sectors that shall be used by the SACU membership. To ensure that the template is flexible enough for SACU to easily adopt and use in ongoing bilateral negotiations, for example. South Afric...|$|R

There is no obligation on WTO Members to use any particular classification system in undertaking commitments. Nevertheless, an informal document produced for the services negotiation during the Uruguay Round, the Services Sectoral Classification List (W/ 120), was used and continues to be used as the principal guiding classification system, not only in the WTO, but also in bilateral and plurilateral services trade negotiations outside of the WTO. WTO jurisprudence has also noted the role of W/ 120 in the determination of sectoral coverage <b>of</b> GATS <b>commitments.</b> However, services classification does not receive enough attention it deserves. This paper attempts to make contribution by providing an overview of services classification and highlighting its relevance to both trade negotiations and WTO dispute settlement. It consists of four sections. Section I reviews how a services classification system was introduced into the multilateral trading system and describes the main features of W 120. Section II takes a closer look at some aspects of the classification system, drawing attention to challenges in its application, which arise from inter alia services with multiple end-uses, overlaps between sectors, and the issue of "new services". Section III considers the implications of classification on GATS commitments by examining a number of WTO dispute settlement cases. Section IV concludes. In conclusion, the paper underlines the importance of services classification in assisting governments in clearly and accurately undertaking commitments. It also notes that WTO Members have taken or suggested various pragmatic approaches to addressing challenges in the application of the current services classification system. The proposed approaches again highlight the role of classification in ensuring the clarity, certainty and predictability <b>of</b> specific <b>commitments</b> in services...|$|R
40|$|Unit Commitment Problem (UCP) is a {{nonlinear}} mixed integer {{optimization problem}} {{used in the}} <b>scheduling</b> operation <b>of</b> power system generating units subjected to demand and reserve requirement constraints for achieving minimum operating cost. The task of the UC problem {{is to determine the}} on/off state of the generating units at every hour interval of the planning period for optimally transmitting the load and reserve among the committed units. The importance for the necessity of a more effective optimal solution to the UCP problem is increasing with the regularly varying demand. Hereby, we propose a hybrid approach which solves the unit commitment problem subjected to necessary constraints and gives the optimal <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> the units. The possible combination of demand and their corresponding optimal generation schedule can be determined by the PSO algorithm. Being a global optimization technique, Evolutionary Programming (EP) for solving Unit Commitment Problem, operates on a method, which encodes each unit’s operating schedule with respect to up/down time. When the demand over a time horizon is given as input to the network it successfully gives the <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> each unit’s <b>commitment</b> that satisfies the demands of all the periods and results in minimum total cost. Because hybridization is dominating, this approach for solving the unit commitment problem is more effective...|$|R

Some small territories, like islands and isolated areas, actually experience a high penetration rate of PV inside a small electricity grid. Moreover, the high amplitude fluctuations of PV outputs can destabilize the grid stability. In {{order to avoid the}} risk of blackout, some countries set up regulatory limits of PV integration. In this context, the forecasting of the PV output is necessary for the supply-demand balance and for the increase of the penetration rate of PV. Previous works on this topic were mainly done for large-scale continental grids. Due to the small scale of the climatic phenomena, forecasting the solar irradiance in insular territories addresses new issues. In order to cope with specific plant operations, forecasts must be provided with different granularities and horizons. In this work, we will focus on day ahead forecasts with an hourly granularity. Dayahead forecasts are produced for <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> resources and <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> units of production. This paper presents a comparison of two post processing models. A Model Output Statistics (MOS) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are applied to the IFS (Integrated Forecast System) forecasts for the insular site of Saint-Pierre in Reunion Island. The small scale of the climatic phenomena requires to set up these post processing methods differently than in the continental areas. cf 201...|$|R
40|$|The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) {{has proved}} to be a less {{effective}} and more problematic instrument than hoped for at its enactment nearly twenty years ago. A recent case brought by the United States, China-Electronic Payment Services, illustrates a number of the problems, such as the uncertain definition and scope of sectors listed in Members 2 ̆ 7 <b>schedules</b> <b>of</b> liberalization <b>commitments.</b> The Panel Report also shows the unique challenges of crafting a test and setting an evidentiary burden for establishing a state-driven monopoly when the industry has natural-monopoly characteristics-which are typical of many tradable services like telecommunications and payment processing networks. Further, this Panel was the first to deal with the complication of overlapping yet seemingly contradictory market access and national treatment commitments in a particular subsector. In this case, for electronic payment services, China appeared to commit to provide treatment no less favorable than that extended to domestic suppliers, yet at the same time reserved the right to deny foreign suppliers access to the Chinese market. Which inscription governs, given that GATS itself provides no clear rule for interpreting such a schedule? The Panel concluded that the denial of market access trumped the granting of national treatment, an outcome that may be reasonable in this particular context but which lacks a firm basis in the GATS text. This Comment argues that the confusion about <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> market access and national treatment <b>commitments</b> is symptomatic <b>of</b> deeper ambiguity about the scope of the disciplines themselves. This Comment explores of the implications of four different interpretive rules in eight different scheduling scenarios, extending the existing literature by more fully defining and evaluating the rules and applying them to a broader range of situations. Ultimately, no one rule can be consistent with the text of GATS and with the expectations <b>of</b> both the <b>scheduling</b> Member and its trading partners. To resolve this problem, this Comment advocates a pragmatic, empirical, harm- or surprise-minimizing approach aimed at approximating the common intention of Members. Finally, this Comment considers the lessons of China- Electronic Payment Services for the nascent negotiations on a new international trade in services agreement (TISA) ...|$|R
