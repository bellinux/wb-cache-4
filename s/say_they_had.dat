5|$|Ternent allowed Swan {{to play on}} a month-to-month {{contract}} for the 1999–2000 season. Swan rushed his nine-month recovery period down to seven months and was playing and living on painkillers. He secretly used suppositories to stop himself from passing blood after his stomach began rejecting the painkillers. Fighting a losing battle against injuries, in March 2000 Ternent allowed {{him to leave the}} club. Before he took the decision, Swan and Ronnie Jepson began to polish the boots of legendary new signing Ian Wright – {{just to be able to}} <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> done so. Five days after leaving Burnley he went to York City in the fourth tier. This reunited him with former manager Terry Dolan, who offered him a contract until the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|Three more {{individuals}} who <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> unprotected sex with Usher sued him on allegations of fraud, sexual battery, infliction of emotional distress and more, alleging {{that he was}} positive for the herpes virus and didn't tell them in advance. All three are represented by attorney Lisa Bloom who said {{at the news conference}} on 8 August 2017 that one of her three clients had contracted genital herpes allegedly from Usher. One of the accusers, Quantasia Sharpton, said she had unprotected sex with him after a concert she attended around her 19th birthday. The other two accusers, one male, one female, preferred to remain anonymous plaintiffs. Sharpton admitted she tested negative for herpes and Bloom stated she didn't know if the singer had the disease.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to extensive police appeals, two eyewitnesses came forward on 6 January to <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> seen the girl {{at a bus}} station {{in the company of}} a middle-aged man. One of these individuals was able to identify this man as a former lodger of the Tinsleys. A neighbor of the Tinsley family also informed the police that she had seen this former lodger of the theirs standing alone, loitering on a street corner close to Mona's school, staring in the direction of the entrance to the premises on the afternoon of her abduction. Later that day, a bus conductor named Charles Reville confirmed to police that the previous day, a young girl matching Mona's description had indeed boarded his 4:45 p.m. bus from Newark to Retford {{in the company of a}} middle-aged man, and the pair had alighted his bus at Grove Street, Retford. Reville ominously added that this man had purchased a return ticket for himself, but only a single ticket for the girl. Reville's claims were independently substantiated by a passenger on the bus named Stanley Betts, who also claimed to have seen a middle-aged man travelling between Newark and Retford with a girl matching Mona's description.|$|E
500|$|The {{aluminum}} apex, at {{the time}} a rare metal as valuable as silver, was cast by William Frishmuth of Philadelphia. At the time of casting, it was the largest piece of aluminum in the world. Before the installation it was put on public display at Tiffany's in New York City and stepped over by visitors who could <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> [...] "stepped {{over the top of the}} Washington Monument". It was [...] tall before [...] was removed from its tip by lightning strikes during 1885–1934, when it was protected from further damage by tall lightning rods surrounding it. Its base is [...] square. The angle between opposite sides at its tip is 34°48'. It weighed [...] before lightning strikes removed a small amount of aluminum from its tip and sides. Spectral analysis in 1934 showed that it was composed of 97.87% aluminum with the rest impurities. It has a shallow depression in its base to match a slightly raised area atop the small upper surface of the marble capstone, which aligns the sides of the apex with those of the capstone, and the downward protruding lip around that area prevents water from entering the joint. It has a large hole in the center of its base to receive a threaded [...] diameter copper rod which attaches it to the monument and used to form part of the lightning protection system.|$|E

In the same interview, Grammer expressed his loss of faith for a few years after Karen's death. He subsequently forgave Glenn but refused to support the man's release, saying it would [...] "be a betrayal of my sister’s life.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the charges}} brought against Manstein were almost {{identical}} to those brought against Rundstedt, it is worth quoting the remarks made by the prosecutor at Manstein's trial, Sir Arthur Comyns Carr: [...] "Contemporary German militarism flourished briefly with its recent ally, National Socialism, as well as or better than {{it had in the}} generals of the past. Many of these have made a mockery of the soldier's oath of obedience to military orders. When it suits their purpose they <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to obey; when confronted with Hitler's brutal crimes which are shown to have been within their general knowledge, they say they disobeyed. The truth is they actively participated in all these crimes, or sat silent and acquiescent, witnessing the commission of crimes on a scale larger and more shocking than the world has ever had the misfortune to know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{findings}} of the inquiry into Wright's death were released in September 2010, Ulster Television News broadcast a report regarding the question of collusion. South Belfast UDA brigadier Jackie McDonald explained to Ulster Television's Live Tonight the UVF's mindset at the time Wright was threatened with execution by the CLMC in 1996, [...] "It was obvious he [...] was doing his own thing and going his own way. I think he had become such an embarrassment to the UVF that they had to send word to him {{to get out of the}} country – that's when the LVF was formed, that's when the breakaway group appeared." [...] When asked by the interviewer whether or not the CLMC had actually been prepared to carry out the death threat against Wright McDonald replied, [...] "You have to be prepared to kill people if you tell them to do something and they don't do it – something of that magnitude. If you <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to go and they don't go – the defiance alone, it doesn't leave many alternatives". McDonald expressed his personal belief that there had probably been no state collusion in Wright's death. Equally dismissive of the allegations of collusion, Willie Gallagher of the Republican Socialist Movement offered the suggestion that had the INLA not killed Wright, he would have been released from prison shortly afterwards. Once free, Wright would have continued to conduct and orchestrate his murder campaign against nationalists.|$|E
2500|$|In 1962, Fo {{wrote and}} {{directed}} a variety show, Canzonissima, for RAI. Fo used the show to give Italians {{a glimpse of a}} type of television resembling the origins of theatre, far removed from the [...] "junk TV" [...] previously produced by the company. Canzonissima featured satirical songs and sketches depicting the lives of the working classes. However, it was frequently censored. One sketch featured a fat aunt who came to visit her nephew at his workplace (a canned meat factory) only to fall into a machine and come out as mincemeat, which the nephew retained in a cupboard at home and often displayed to friends: this led to complaints from canned meat producers and [...] "industrialists in general"—though none from aunts, Fo later observed. Nonetheless Canzonissima proved popular, attracting millions of viewers, and Rame maintained that taxi drivers in Italian cities would often <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no work during broadcasts as everyone was watching it. Its eighth episodewhich referenced the dangerous conditions faced by workers on building sitesled to a dispute with the programme's producers, and prompted Fo and Rame to walk out on 29 November 1962. RAI maintained it would not broadcast the sketch as it risked further inflaming the annoyance of building workers' unions at working conditions. National uproar ensued over this censorship, with headlines in the daily newspapers and questions in the Italian parliament. RAI sued Fo and Rame and destroyed all the Canzonissima recordings. The dispute led to the effective banning of Fo and Rame from Italian television for 14 years.|$|E
