5|$|After {{a week of}} fighting, the Soviets {{launched}} their counteroffensives– Operation Kutuzov on the northern side and a coinciding one on the southern <b>side.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> southern side of the salient near Prokhorovka, the 5th Guards Tank Army engaged the II SS-Panzer Corps of the 4th Panzer Army, resulting in a large clash of armour. The 5th Guards Tank Army suffered significant losses in the attack, but succeeded in preventing the Wehrmacht from capturing Prokhorovka and breaking through the third defensive belt– the last heavily fortified one. The German high command, unable to accomplish its objective, cancelled Operation Citadel and began redeploying its forces to deal with new pressing developments elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Cheyenne {{prototype}} #6 (s/n 66-8831) began conducting weapons {{testing at}} Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, demonstrating {{the ability for}} the gunner and pilot to accurately fire on separate targets on each <b>side</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> helicopter. Towards the end of 1970, the Army funded work on TOW missile guidance and night sighting systems. Prototypes #6 and #9 were also tested and evaluated at Yuma Proving Ground from 30 January to 23 December 1971, to determine if stability and control systems were sufficient. Deficiencies were identified in lateral directional stability, uncommanded motion during maneuvering, high vibration, and poor directional control during sidewards flying.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry one possible explanation of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA. This possibility began with one piece of evidence uncovered by the Inquiry during cross-examination of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise the morning after the crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on its <b>side</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E
5|$|On each <b>side</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{entry of}} the cathedral is a stone {{crucifix}} and a holy water font. High {{on the left side}} there is a brick from the Lateran Basilica, and on the right side a jubilee 2000 medal. The crypt is accessed through the door in the right wall of the vestibule, then up to the organ matroneum and finally down through the door on the left wall. In the crypt, there is an oratory, as well as Catechism rooms and the office of the Caritas charity.|$|E
5|$|Structure A-19 and Structure C-9 are ballcourts. They have a {{resemblance}} to ballcourts at Chichen Itza. Both ballcourts are aligned east-west, an unusual {{feature in the}} Maya area, although the topography of the site severely restricted {{the layout of the}} city to a principally east-west orientation. BallcourtA-19 lies on the west <b>side</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north plaza.|$|E

50|$|The {{main storage}} depot for the railway {{is behind the}} new outer dyke. This is crossed by a {{switchback}} and has a <b>siding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>side.</b> It follows the embankment for about 3 km of its length. In the middle there is another <b>siding.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> island, the route branches to Nordstrandischmoor station and Neuwarft, {{which is the only}} one of <b>the</b> four warfs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island of Nordstrandischmoor with its own railway link.|$|R
5|$|The Venus Express probe {{has shown}} through stellar {{occultation}} that the atmospheric haze extends much further {{up on the}} night side than the day <b>side.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> day side the cloud deck has a thickness of 20km and extends up to about 65km, whereas on the night side the cloud deck {{in the form of}} a thick haze reaches up to 90km in altitude—well into mesosphere, continuing even further to 105km as a more transparent haze. In 2011, the spacecraft discovered that Venus has a thin ozone layer at an altitude of 100km.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of the Warrior-class ships {{was intended}} to be 40 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 19 on each <b>side</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck. This was modified during construction to ten rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns, twenty-six 68-pounders, and four rifled breech-loading 40-pounder guns.|$|E
5|$|A small neutral bloc arose {{with the}} Non-Aligned Movement; it sought good {{relations}} with both sides. The two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat, but they were heavily armed {{in preparation for a}} possible all-out nuclear world war. Each side had a nuclear strategy that discouraged an attack by the other <b>side,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker—the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). Aside from the development of the two sides' nuclear arsenals, and their deployment of conventional military forces, the struggle for dominance was expressed via proxy wars around the globe, psychological warfare, massive propaganda campaigns and espionage, rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.|$|E

5|$|After the two rivers merge, the Avon {{then turns}} south east {{away from the}} Cotswolds and then quickly south into the clay Dauntsey Vale, where it is joined by the River Marden, until it reaches the biggest town so far, Chippenham. The wide vale {{is now known as}} the Avon Vale, and the river flows on via Lacock to Melksham, then turns north-west through Bradford on Avon, where the centre of the town grew up around the ford across the river Avon, hence the origin of the town's name ("Broad-Ford"). This was {{supplemented}} in Norman times by the stone bridge that still stands today. The Norman side is upstream, and has pointed arches; the newer side has curved arches. The Town Bridge and Chapel is a grade I listed building. It was originally a Packhorse bridge, but widened in the 17th century by rebuilding the western <b>side.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> bridge stands a small building which was originally a chapel but later used as a town lock-up.|$|E
5|$|Derby Place was {{situated}} in the parish of St Benedict and St Peter, south of St Paul's Cathedral, more or less on the College's present location. There are records of the heralds carrying out modifications {{to the structure of}} Derby Place over many years. However, little record of its appearance has survived, except the description that the buildings formed three sides of a quadrangle, entered through a gate with a portcullis on the west <b>side.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> south range, roughly where Queen Victoria Street now stands, was a large hall on the western end. Derby Place's hearth tax bill from 1663, discovered in 2009 at the National Archives at Kew, showed that the building had about thirty-two rooms, which were the workplace as well as the home to eleven officers of arms.|$|E
5|$|In the 1914 season, Lee {{almost doubled}} his total of {{first-class}} appearances. Two early season appearances against Oxford and Cambridge universities brought a few runs, and {{a match for}} the MCC against Hampshire saw Lee bat at number six in both innings. He played just twice in the County Championship prior to August, both times against Warwickshire. The start of the First World War in early August initially resulted in the cancellation of Middlesex's tour of the northern counties, Yorkshire and Lancashire, but this decision was later reversed, and Middlesex took a heavily weakened <b>side</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tour. Due to regular opening batsman William Robertson being unavailable, Lee was promoted to open the batting alongside Frank Tarrant. He scored 30 and 16 against Yorkshire, followed by 1 and 44 not out against Lancashire. Lee and Tarrant continued to open for Middlesex {{for the remainder of}} the season, and against Nottinghamshire, Lee scored his first century in first-class cricket. Having been dismissed for 17 in the first innings, Lee scored 139 runs in the second, and shared a partnership of 183 runs with Patsy Hendren, who also reached his century.|$|E

5|$|On {{the front}} <b>side,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Rokin, the rescue {{operations}} of the fire department were also hampered. There were so many people standing on the window ledges screaming that the fire fighters did not know who to save first. Time was also lost because some people threw their luggage in the life net and then jumped into it themselves, causing injuries. Some people fell {{to the side of}} the net and were severely injured. Just before 7:00am the part of the hotel which faced the Kalverstraat collapsed. The burning debris landed on the fire engine in the Kalverstraat, and the fire fighters barely escaped to safety. The nearby book store was also burned out and fires broke out in several buildings on the other side of the Kalverstraat, which were quickly brought under control.|$|E
5|$|Prieto and Böhme {{describe}} M2 as less rounded than M1 and De Bruijn {{notes that}} the crests are more parallel. In addition to the five main crests, small crests are present in front of and behind the centroloph that do not cover the full width of the tooth. In one S.bolligeri M2, {{there is a small}} crest on the lingual side in front of the centroloph, but such a crest does not occur in any S.alpinus. Another M2 of S.bolligeri has this crest on the labial <b>side.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, all five M2 of S.alpinus have a minor crest on the labial side behind the centroloph. In two M2 of S.alpinus, the centroloph and the metaloph are connected by a longitudinal crest, which is never present in S.bolligeri. There are three roots.|$|E
5|$|Tagliani ran {{in sixth}} gear after his team {{ordered him to}} {{conserve}} fuel {{and was unable to}} generate enough heat into his tires to challenge Andretti on the restarts. On lap 87, Fittipaldi tried an overtaking manoevure on Junqueira around the outside of turn three which resulted in Fittipaldi and Junqueira making contact and both drivers slid into the outside tire barrier. Andretti's lead of 7.4 seconds was reduced to nothing when the eleventh (and final) caution was displayed on the next lap to allow course officials to extract Fittipaldi's and Junquiera's cars from the track. Racing resumed on lap 90 with Andretti retaining the first position and pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Fernández's radio had malfunctioned and was in another gear in an attempt to save fuel which allowed Tagliani to pass him for second. However, Tagliani was unable to close the gap to Andretti because of the presence of Junqueira's lapped car which cost him more than two seconds. He drove on the track's dirty <b>side</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> backstraight and his tires were cleaned in the next five turns on the track.|$|E

5|$|The {{approach}} to Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{was much more}} difficult from the east, the American-held side, than from the west, the North Korean <b>side.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> east side there was no road climbing halfway to the top; {{from the base of}} the mountain at the edge of the Haman valley the only way to make the ascent was by foot trail. Climbers took two to three hours to reach the top of P'il-bong from the reservoir area, and required from three to four hours to get on top of Battle Mountain from the valley floor. The turnaround time for supply trains to Battle Mountain was six hours. Often a dispatch runner required eight hours to go up Battle Mountain and come back down. In some places the trail was so steep that climbers had to set up ropes to hold along the side of the trail. North Korean night patrols constantly cut telephone lines. The wire men had a difficult and dangerous job trying to maintain wire communication with units on the mountain. Food, water and ammunition were frequently short for the units at the tops of the peaks.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of the Hector-class ships {{was intended}} to be 32 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 15 on each <b>side</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck. This was modified during Hectors construction to four rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns mounted on the upper deck and twenty-four 68-pounders on the broadside. Valiant, due to the delays in her construction and a shortage of guns, never received any of these guns. The breech-loading guns were a new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. To partially alleviate their overweight condition the ships were not fully armed and only received four 110-pounders on the upper deck and twenty 68-pounders on the main deck behind armour. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an armoured target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–64 caused the navy to withdraw the gun from service shortly afterwards.|$|E
