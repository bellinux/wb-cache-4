40|$|University of Maryland School of Pharmacy {{was in a}} quandary: its {{comprehensive}} mission required meeting state workforce needs {{while increasing}} educational quality, expanding research, and responding to service needs, but state resources were declining, faculty members were <b>stressed,</b> <b>construction</b> of a long-needed new building was stalled, and pressure to increase doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) enrollment was growing. A sharp challenge from the Board of Regents mobilized the school to quickly launch a growth initiative to accelerate PharmD program expansion through a satellite campus. Within 4 months, a plan was approved that not only led to enrollment growth, but also to a significant expansion of the faculty and staff, increased operating and capital budgets, and ground breaking for an $ 83 million new building. This case study illustrates how seemingly competitive needs such as teaching, research, and service can be woven together synergistically to accomplish multiple goals...|$|E
40|$|DE 102008028544 A 1 UPAB: 20100107 NOVELTY - Thermoplastic molding {{composition}} comprises {{a matrix}} phase {{of at least}} one polysaccharide ester in at least one nanoscalic filler, where the molding composition is free of plasticizers. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for: (1) a method for preparing plasticizer-free thermoplastic molding composition comprising homogenously mixing the nanoscalic filler, under the influence of mechanical shearing forces, with the matrix phase; (2) molded parts prepared from the above molding composition; and (3) a method for preparing the molded parts comprising processing the above thermoplastic molded composition by extrusion (preferably profile and film extrusion), injection molding, injection blow molding, pressing or melt spinning. USE - The thermoplastic molding composition is useful for preparing molded parts that are useful as high-strength and/or highly <b>stressed</b> <b>construction</b> components, plate, film, bristle, monofilament or fiber in the area of transportation and communication, industrial sector, machinery and plant construction, household appliances, container construction, medical technology and electrical and electronics (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The thermoplastic molding composition exhibits high strength and stiffness {{even in the absence of}} plasticizers. The addition of nanoscalic fillers (preferably nanoscalic phyllosilicate) after incorporation into the matrix provides the effect of the addition of plasticizers and also provides the characteristics of reduced gas and liquid permeability, and increased flame and heat resistance...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study proposes {{three models}} {{to explain the}} {{mechanism}} {{of the three major}} types of mafic dyke swarms. Parallel dyke swarms form in response to a regional stress field, e. g. the mafic dyke swarms in the North China Craton, whereas small radiating dyke swarm forms due to <b>stress</b> <b>constructions</b> around a plutonic or volcanic edifice, such as the dyke swarm at Spanish Peak, USA. The third type of radiating dyke swarm is giant fan-shaped dyke swarm such as the Mackenzie dyke swarm. Fractures that formed prior to magmatism may {{play a vital role in}} dictating the dyke swarm geometry. In most of the cases, the pre-existing fractures are induced by tectonic stresses and not by magma injection though magma injection can increase the fracture size by propagation at the dyke tip...|$|R

Considerations in the design of such structures include the lack of gravity, allowing structures to be built with much less supporting weight, the cost of transportation to orbit, leading to the use of aluminum or composite materials stored on reels and attached to a beam builder, and the required surface accuracy in the presence of thermal <b>stresses.</b> <b>Construction</b> factors to consider include the use of astronauts and remote manipulators in assembly, both of which have been demonstrated to be feasible...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to analyze how a wing {{constructed}} in such a way that has different in-built angles of attack behaves in front of a conventional built wing. The flow around the wing profile of the Airbus A 380 was simulated by CFD and the normalized aerodynamical data (lift, drag, aerodynamic center etc.) was be obtained. Next, the wing profile was modified by changing the in-built angle of attack progressively from root to tip. The aerodynamic behaviouf of the resulting twisted wing profile was simulated by CFD and the aerodynamic data was compared with that of the standard wing. The potential benefits and difficulties of the mixed profiles wing was analysed both from the aerodynamic (flight stability, fuel consumption, etc.) and the structural (induced <b>stress,</b> <b>construction</b> methods, and available materials) points of view...|$|R

40|$|Structural-heterogeneous, <b>stressed</b> media (<b>construction</b> {{materials}} in the ultrasonic range of frequences) are considered in the paper aiming at the development of acoustic impulse methods for {{the investigation of the}} structural and <b>stressed</b> state of <b>construction</b> materials. As a result the propagation of the narrew-band wave package in a structural-heterogeneous medium has been investigated. The methodology for the precision measurement of the phase speed of elastic waves has been suggested. Algorithms for the determination of two-axial stresses, non-uniaxial to symmtry axises of an orthotropic material, by the acoustic method have been developed. The impulse acoustic method for the determination of the plane stressed state of erthotropic materials, method taking into account the influence of the material structural heterogeneity on the material acoustic characteristics, has been developed. The effect of the dynamic acousoelasticity in metals has been detected and investigated for the first time. It is possible to construct the new non-destructing method for the determination of dynamic stresses on the base of the above mentioned effect. The methods for the determination of <b>stresses</b> in <b>construction</b> elements by the ultrasonic method have been introduced into operation.

25|$|The {{resulting}} aircraft, {{which was}} designed by {{a team led by}} Ed Heinemann resembled a scaled-down Northrop Delta.

50|$|By {{the late}} 1930s the {{widespread}} adoption of all-metal <b>stressed</b> skin <b>construction</b> of aircraft meant, {{at least in}} theory, that the aerodynamic penalties that had limited the performance of pushers (and indeed any unconventional layout), were reduced; however any improvement that boosts pusher performance also boosts the performance of conventional aircraft and they remained a rarity in operational service - so the gap was narrowed but was not closed entirely.|$|R
50|$|It is a <b>stressed</b> skin <b>construction,</b> {{in which}} the flat {{aluminium}} body panels, and especially the floor, triangulate the largely rectangular steel tubular frame structure.

The flat panels avoid difficulties in shaping aluminum sheet into smooth compound curves. On the down side, it does not allow attractive curves or streamlining.|$|R

A step-by-step procedure is presented which takes into account the creep of concrete under variable stress, variations in Young's modulus of concrete, and all elastic changes in <b>stress</b> accompanying the <b>construction</b> of additional segments.
