5000|$|Antique - {{the first}} name used for <b>slab-serifs,</b> but in France often used for sans-serifs. Sometimes taken to mean <b>slab-serifs</b> in the nineteenth-century style with Didone letterforms and thick, square <b>slab-serifs.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Egyptian/Egyptienne - mostly {{used for}} <b>slab-serifs</b> generally, {{although}} first {{used by the}} Caslon Foundry in naming their sans-serif, the first made. Continued {{to be used as}} a name for [...] "geometric" [...] <b>slab-serifs</b> appearing in the twentieth century, and so several geometric <b>slab-serifs</b> had Egyptian-themed names, including Memphis, Cairo and Karnak.|$|E
5000|$|A second aspect in the {{development}} of <b>slab-serifs</b> was the influence of geometric design of the 1920s, and many <b>slab-serifs</b> were produced that had a more monoline structure similar to geometric sans-serifs also popular around this time, such as Futura. These are called [...] "geometric" [...] designs.|$|E
25|$|Examples of <b>slab-serif</b> typefaces include Clarendon, Rockwell, Archer, Courier, Excelsior and TheSerif. FF Meta Serif and Guardian Egyptian are {{examples}} of newspaper and small print-orientated typefaces with some <b>slab-serif</b> characteristics, often most visible in the bold weights.|$|R
25|$|Because of the clear, bold {{nature of}} the large serifs, slab serif designs are often used for posters and in small print. Many monospace fonts, on which all {{characters}} occupy {{the same amount of}} horizontal space as in a typewriter, are <b>slab-serif</b> designs. While not always purely <b>slab-serif</b> designs, many fonts intended for newspaper use have large slab-like serifs for clearer reading on poor-quality paper. Many early <b>slab-serif</b> types, being intended for posters, only come in bold styles with the key differentiation being width, and often have no lower-case letters at all.|$|R
50|$|Lexia is a <b>slab-serif</b> {{typeface}} {{developed in}} 2000 by Dalton Maag.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Antique by Vincent Figgins, one of {{the first}} <b>slab-serifs.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Clarendon - often {{particularly}} used {{to refer}} to <b>slab-serifs</b> with 'bracketed’ serifs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} <b>slab-serifs</b> {{were often}} called [...] "antiques" [...] or [...] "Egyptians". They were often quite monoline in construction and had similarities to nineteenth-century serif fonts, such as ball terminals.|$|E
50|$|ITC Lubalin Graph is a <b>slab-serif</b> {{version of}} ITC Avant Garde, also {{designed}} by Lubalin.|$|R
5000|$|Karnak is a <b>slab-serif</b> {{typeface}} {{designed by}} R. Hunter Middleton for the Ludlow Typograph company.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{conventional}} <b>slab-serif</b> typeface, Rockwell. The serifs {{have been}} thickened and the contrast is minimal.|$|R
5000|$|Ionic - in {{the nineteenth}} century used as a name for <b>slab-serifs.</b> In the twentieth century this term became used to mean text faces with some Clarendon-style features, because of an {{influential}} body text face of this name from Linotype - this followed from previous faces of the same name only slightly bolder than text proportions from Miller & Richard.|$|E
50|$|Antique: In about 1817, the Figgins foundry in London made a type {{with square}} or <b>slab-serifs</b> which it called 'Antique', and that name {{was adopted by}} most of the British and US typefounders. An {{exception}} was the typefounder Thorne, who confused things by marketing his Antique under the name 'Egyptian'. In France it became Egyptienne, and to worsen the confusion, the French called sans-serif type 'Antique'. Some fonts, such as Antique Olive, still carry the name.|$|E
5000|$|The Caslon {{company called}} the type Italian. Nicolete Gray has {{concluded}} that the style was [...] "probably" [...] Italian in origin, although it was certainly very common for display types to be given unusual, exotic names as a brand; for example, [...] "Egyptian" [...] was often applied to sans (and later slab) serif types of the period and [...] "Antique" [...] to <b>slab-serifs.</b> Reverse-contrast designs do slightly resemble capitalis rustica Roman writing, although {{this may be a}} coincidence. They were also called Egyptian.|$|E
50|$|Memphis is a <b>slab-serif</b> {{typeface}} {{designed in}} 1929 by Dr. Rudolf Wolf and released originally by the Stempel Type Foundry.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Slab-serif</b> type {{was perhaps}} first commercially {{introduced}} by Vincent Figgins {{under the name}} [...] "Antique", appearing in a type-specimen dated 1815 (but probably issued in 1817).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Slab-serif</b> type on {{the heading}} of a Chartist poster, 1848. Some {{headings}} and the lower passage are in Didone type, but much body text is slab serif.|$|R
50|$|The face {{is unique}} for {{combining}} the geometric structure of twentieth-century European <b>slab-serifs</b> but imbuing {{the face with}} a domestic, less strident tone of voice. Balls were added to the upper terminals on letters such as C and G to increase its charm. Italics are true italic designs, with flourishes influenced by calligraphy, an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs. As with many Hoefler & Frere-Jones designs, it was released {{in a wide range of}} weights from hairline to bold, reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines.|$|E
5000|$|Joanna {{is based}} on the {{traditional}} old-style serif model of the Renaissance. However, the spare, sharp squared serifs and minimal contrast of strokes give the design a 20th-century modernist feeling, reminiscent of the slab serifs of the nineteenth century but far lighter than most typefaces of this genre. This is very similar to Gill's earlier typeface Solus, in many ways a predecessor to Joanna, in which Gill intended to create a design inspired by the basic structure of <b>slab-serifs</b> of the nineteenth century, with their almost-monoline structure and simple block serifs, but adapted to be suitable for body text. (Solus was never particularly popular, perhaps because it did not have an italic.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Clarendons have a bold, solid {{structure}}, {{similar in}} letter structure to the [...] "modern" [...] serif typefaces {{popular in the}} nineteenth century for body text (for instance showing an 'R' with a curled leg and ball terminals on the 'a' and 'c'), but bolder and with less contrast in stroke weight. Clarendon designs generally have a structure with bracketed serifs, which become larger as they reach the main stroke of the letter. Mitja Miklavčič describes the basic features of Clarendon designs (and ones labelled Ionic, often quite similar) as: [...] "plain and sturdy nature, strong bracketed serifs, vertical stress, large x-height, short ascenders and descenders, typeface with little contrast" [...] and supports Nicolete Gray's description of them as a [...] "cross between the roman body text type and slab serif model". Gray notes that nineteenth-century Ionic and Clarendon faces have [...] "a definite differentiation between the thick and the thin strokes", unlike some other more geometric <b>slab-serifs.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Beton is a <b>slab-serif</b> {{typeface}} {{designed by}} Heinrich Jost and released originally by the Bauer Type Foundry from 1929 onwards, with most major styles released by 1931. [...] "Beton" [...] is German for concrete (originally from French), {{a choice of}} name suggesting its industrial aesthetic.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} terms {{have been}} used for Clarendons and related slab serifs. Common meanings have been added, but they have often not been consistently applied. Many modern writers as a result ignore them and prefer the term <b>slab-serif,</b> providing individual descriptions of the features of specific designs.|$|R
5000|$|Writing in 1825, {{the printer}} and social {{reformer}} Thomas Curson Hansard wrote with amusement that <b>slab-serif</b> {{and other such}} display types were 'the outrageous kind of face only adapted for placards, posting-bills, invitations to the wheel of Fortune...Fashion and Fancy commonly frolic from one extreme to another.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The label [...] "Ionic", {{originally}} {{also used}} for display faces, has become associated with typefaces with some Clarendon/slab-serif features but intended for body text, following the success of several faces with this name from first Miller & Richard (intended to be slightly bolder than contemporary expectations for body text proportions) and then Linotype (its 1922 release Ionic No. 5, extremely successful in newspaper printing). Millington notes that [...] "Ionic became a distinct design in its own right" [...] while Hoefler comments {{that it is now}} [...] "chiefly associated with bracketed faces of the Century model". A decline of interest in Clarendons for display use did, however, take place in the early twentieth century: by 1923, American Type Founders, which specialised in creating demand for new designs of display face, could argue [...] "Who remembers the Clarendons?" [...] in its specimen book, and did not show them (aside from a few numerals) in its 1,148 pages. In addition, the market of slab serifs was disrupted by the arrival of new [...] "geometric" [...] <b>slab-serifs</b> inspired by the sans-serifs of the period, such as Karnak and Beton. However, revivals did appear after the war both in America and Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Besley's {{original}} Clarendon {{design was}} quite compressed, unlike most later 'Clarendons' intended for display setting, {{which are often}} quite wide. One of the original target markets for Besley's Clarendon design was {{to act as a}} bold face within body text, providing a stronger emphasis than the italic type that had been used for centuries for this purpose, and in this it matches the quite condensed body text faces of the period. (The modern system of issuing typefaces in families with a companion bold of matched design did not develop until the twentieth century.) Slab serifs had already begun to be used for bold type by the 1840s, but they were often quite lumpy in design and quite poorly matched to the body text face they were intended to complement. Mosley has written that [...] "the Clarendon type of the Besley foundry is indeed the first type actually designed as a ‘related bold’ - that is, made to harmonize in design and align with the roman types weight typefaces it was set with…Before the launch of Clarendon type printers picked out words in <b>slab-serifs</b> or any other heavy type." [...] However, because of the Clarendon design's strong reputation for quality, it was rapidly copied. Historian Nicolete Gray considered the earlier [...] "Ionic" [...] face from the Caslon Foundry in the same style more effective than Besley's: [...] "Besley's became the normal, but it was certainly not the first…in 1842 Caslon have an upper and in 1843 a lower case with the characteristics fully developed, but of a normal width…Besley's compressed Clarendon is much less pleasing, it has lost emphasis and confidence, and gains only in plausibility." ...|$|E
50|$|Bitstream Charter is a serif {{typeface}} {{designed by}} Matthew Carter in 1987 for Bitstream Inc. Charter {{is based on}} Pierre-Simon Fournier’s characters, originating from the 18th century. Classified by Bitstream as a transitional-serif typeface (Bitstream Transitional 801), it also has features of a <b>slab-serif</b> typeface and is often classified as such.|$|R
5000|$|Cholla Slab is a {{geometric}} <b>slab-serif</b> {{variant of}} a larger typeface family called Cholla designed by Sibylle Hagmann in the period 1998-1999 for the Art Center College of Design. Cholla is licensed by the Emigre foundry. The typeface is named {{for a group of}} cactus species indigenous to the Mojave Desert.|$|R
5000|$|Karnak is a [...] "geometric" [...] slab serif, {{reflecting}} {{the style of}} German geometric sans-serifs (in particular Futura) which had attracted considerable attention in the United States and adapting the design to the slab serif structure. It copies the German geometric <b>slab-serif</b> Memphis. Middleton also designed a loose copy of Futura, the sans-serif Tempo, around the same time. It and other similar designs were popular in American printing during the hot metal typesetting period.|$|R
50|$|Clarendon is {{the name}} of a <b>slab-serif</b> {{typeface}} that was released in 1845 by Thorowgood and Co. (or Thorowgood and Besley) of London, a letter foundry often known as the Fann Street Foundry. The original Clarendon design is credited to Robert Besley, a partner in the foundry, and was originally engraved by punchcutter Benjamin Fox, who may also have contributed to its design. Many copies, adaptations and revivals have been released, becoming almost an entire genre of type design.|$|R
50|$|Intended as attention-grabbing novelty display designs {{more than}} as serious choices for body text, {{within four years}} of their {{introduction}} the printer Thomas Curson Hansard had described them as 'typographic monstrosities'. Nonetheless, somewhat toned-down derivatives of this style persisted in popular use throughout the nineteenth century, and are commonly associated with 'wild west' printing on posters. They ultimately {{became part of the}} Clarendon genre of <b>slab-serif</b> typefaces, and these later designs are often called French Clarendon designs.|$|R
50|$|Neutraface Slab is a {{redesign}} of Neutraface No. 2 in a slab serif style, following {{the style of}} geometric <b>slab-serif</b> popular in the interwar period. The concept originated as joke but when Schwartz proposed the idea to House Industries, they convinced him {{to follow through with}} the concept. The development of Neutraface Slab by Schwartz, Kai Bernau and Susana Carvalho began in 2005 and it was released by House Industries in 2009 in both text and display weights.|$|R
5000|$|Rockwell is a [...] "geometric" [...] <b>slab-serif,</b> with a {{monoline}} construction {{with all}} strokes {{appearing to be}} roughly the same width and its capital 'O' roughly circular. This gives it a similar impression to common sans-serifs of the period like Akzidenz Grotesk, Franklin Gothic, or Futura. It is influenced by a style of geometric slab serif that had become popular released around the time, including the earlier Memphis and Beton, and less similarly Stymie and City.|$|R
50|$|Guardian Egyptian is a <b>slab-serif</b> {{typeface}} {{commissioned by}} Mark Porter for the UK newspaper The Guardian and designed by Paul Barnes and Christian Schwartz between 2004 and 2005. It was {{an essential element}} in The Guardian's move to the Berliner format and is the typeface used in the current masthead. It {{is part of the}} Guardian font family, which also includes Guardian Sans, Guardian Text Egyptian, Guardian Text Sans and Guardian Agate all of which are also used by The Guardian.|$|R
5000|$|Tempo is a 1930 {{sans-serif}} typeface {{designed by}} R. Hunter Middleton for the Ludlow Typograph company. Tempo is a geometric sans design, closely copying Futura which had attracted considerable {{attention in the}} United States. Unlike Futura, however, it has a [...] "dynamic" [...] italic with foot serifs suggesting handwriting. Tempo was expanded to a large family released over the 1930s and 40s, {{that has not been}} completely digitised. It included the shadow-form display typeface Umbra, which has often been released separately. Middleton also designed a <b>slab-serif</b> typeface in similar style, Karnak, around the same time.|$|R
50|$|Slab serif typefaces {{appeared}} {{rapidly in}} the early nineteenth century, having little in common with previous typefaces.As the printing of advertising material began to expand {{in the early nineteenth}} century, new and notionally more attention-grabbing typefaces were needed. Poster-size types began to be developed that were not merely magnified forms of book type, but very different and bolder. Some were developments of designs of the previous fifty years, such as bold and ultra-bold types such as fat faces, which were related to Didone types but much bolder. Others had completely new structures: reverse-contrast letterforms, sans-serif and <b>slab-serif</b> were new departures at this period. Some of the designs appearing around this time may be based on signpainting traditions, or vice versa.|$|R
