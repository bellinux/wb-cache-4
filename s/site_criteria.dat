40|$|The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System {{provides}} third-party verification for environmentally sustainable construction. LEED certified buildings {{often provide}} healthier work and living environments, however, {{it does not}} provide any direct economic incentives to the owners and developers. An early research suggested {{that there was a}} significant correlation between appraised unit value of a parcel and LEED sustainable <b>site</b> <b>criteria</b> for public transportation access. Moreover, the regression model for predicting appraised unit value of a parcel suggested that the coefficient of Number of Light Rail Stations was positive, while the coefficient of Number of Bus Stops was negative. This result contradicted our original expectation that both number of bus stops and light rail stations could {{have a positive effect on}} the appraised unit value. Hence it becomes important to conduct further research to explain this phenomenon. In this research, Pearson correlation was examined to determine whether there is a significant correlation between median household income and the number of bus stops and light rail stations for a given parcel that meet LEED sustainable <b>site</b> <b>criteria</b> for public transportation access. After confirming no significant correlation exists, multiple regression analysis was applied to establish a regression model for predicting unit value of a given parcel using number of bus stops and light rail stations for a given parcel that meet LEED sustainable <b>site</b> <b>criteria</b> for public transportation access, median household income and parcel area as the independent variables. Result of Pearson correlation indicated that there was no significant correlation exists between median household income and the number of bus stops and light rail stations for a given parcel which met LEED sustainable <b>site</b> <b>criteria</b> for public transportation access. Findings of multiple regression analysis suggested that all independent variables were significant predictors for unit value of a parcel. Besides, this regression model had a higher adjusted R- square value than that of the model which was established by Bhagyashri Joshi. It means that this regression model could better predict appraised unit value of an unimproved parcel...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a weather radar siting procedure for a mountainous region in Greece using GIS. The established radar siting objectives consist of the detection and tracking of storms (rainstorms, hailstorms, and snowstorms) requiring operations {{at a low}} elevation angle {{as well as the}} detection of the vertical structure and evolution of a storm. Moreover, the objective includes precipitation intensity measurements and areal precipitation analysis, which is related to the incidence of permanent echoes and obstructions {{as well as to the}} maximum range achievable. Two types of <b>siting</b> <b>criteria</b> are employed; mainly strategic or regional criteria, and local criteria. The strategic criteria mainly consist of set back and communication considerations and local radar <b>siting</b> <b>criteria</b> include the area, geometry or morphology as well as local logistics and practical considerations. In this study, digitized maps of 1 : 100, 000 scale with 100 m contour interval are used.

The potential sites for the weather radar installation are identified on this three-dimensional DTM.

A double questionnaire survey has been undertaken to collect data from 28 finance advisers in an independent financial advisory firm in the UK. Findings - The preliminary findings suggest that the majority of the assessed web <b>site</b> <b>criteria</b> fall in the categories of "maintain strategy" and "no immediate improvement necessary" with certain web site features considered as "strategic overkill" or "improvement necessary". It is also found that the web sites are utilised as a tool for shopping around for quotes but the final purchase would be made by most consumers via the telephone. Research limitations/implications - It is important to mention that an empirical study with a sample of 28 insurance advisers in one financial advisory company can only reflect a limited picture of current practice in the UK car insurance brokers market. Therefore, the findings reported in this paper are tentative and preliminary. To test or confirm relevant findings reported here, further evaluation work with a larger number of assessors having different backgrounds may be necessary. Practical implications - While the majority of the assessed web <b>site</b> <b>criteria</b> fall in the "maintain strategy" and "no immediate improvement necessary" fields, efforts should be made by practitioners to improve site maps, site search, and insurers' details for quotes.

Instead of relying on best professional judgment or previous knowledge of {{a limited number of}} sites, we performed an objective evaluation of cumulative impact on all catchments using land use data sets. These included road and impoundment data from DLGs and Multi-Resolution Land use Consortium data. Land use impairment was measured as percentages of forest, urban, pasture, row crops, and barren area for both the entire catchment and for 10, 40, and 130 -m riparian buffers, road and impoundment density and stream/road crossings. Sites were then ranked by land use impairment, with the least impaired selected as candidate reference sites.
