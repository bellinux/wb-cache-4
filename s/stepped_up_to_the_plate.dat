5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, the Indians {{opened up the}} game. Boudreau and Joe Gordon hit {{back-to-back}} singles, which brought Keltner to the plate. The Red Sox expected a bunt, but instead the third baseman hit his 31st home run of the season to put the Indians ahead, 4–1. Galehouse was then replaced with Ellis Kinder, who was met with a double by Larry Doby. Kinder responded by getting the next three batters out, which brought the score to 5–1 as Doby also scored. After Bearden got three Red Sox out, the Indians started the fifth inning with {{the top of their}} lineup. Mitchell and Eddie Robinson, who came in for Clark, were out. Boudreau then <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> and hit his second home run of the night to make the score 6–1.|$|E
25|$|Nashville {{began its}} {{first season with}} a long road trip, playing against Macon, Augusta, and Birmingham, and accruing a 7–4 record in the process. The Americans played their first regular season home game on May 4 against the Columbus Stars. Len Sowders led off the first inning by {{reaching}} first base on an error. Batting second was James Hillery who made the team's first hit. John Cullen also reached base on an error. Joe Werrick later <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> and hit a triple, scoring Hillery and Cullen. Those would be Nashville's only runs of the game, a 2–3 loss {{in front of the}} home crowd.|$|E
500|$|During filming, Gillian Anderson {{was unsure}} how exactly to perform her lines. She noted, [...] "the way the script was {{originally}} read to me, initially {{seemed to me}} as if Scully kind of <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> and played along with the sheriff's humor". She reportedly performed her lines in a [...] "tongue in cheek"-esque way before receiving a call from Carter. He informed her that her lines were not meant to be humorous and that the production staff was having to [...] "edit out a lot of stuff" [...] in order to make up for this. Several of the scenes in the episode were shot at the places they stood in for. The gas station scene was filmed at a real gas station across from the series' production headquarters. The supermarket shots were filmed in an actual supermarket, Shop Easy in Port Coquitlam, a first for the series, according to art director Greg Loewen. The scenes required the store to be closed before Christmas and be installed with up-right freezers.|$|E

500|$|On {{its initial}} broadcast, the episode was watched by 2.998 million viewers. It {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, with TV Guide ranking the episode No. 95 in its 2009 list of [...] "TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time". BuddyTV's Don Williams deemed the finale [...] "absolutely fantastic", and ranked it tenth {{on his list}} of the top Supernatural episodes {{of the first three}} seasons. Although he [...] "respected the show for having the guts to follow through with [...] deal"—the ending was a [...] "complete jaw-dropper"—he pointed out the previous times the Winchesters have died and were subsequently resurrected. Memorable moments for Williams include Sam and Dean singing [...] "Wanted Dead or Alive", and Dean admitting that his love for Sam is his main weakness. Likewise, TV Guides Tina Charles described the episode as [...] "creepy and suspenseful and funny and sad and just plain awesome", and felt it came close to outdoing the first-season finale [...] "Devil's Trap". Especially praised were the actors' performances. Padalecki [...] "totally <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> and knocked one out of the park", and Ackles was [...] "nine kinds of awesome". On the latter, Charles noted, [...] "From acting out Dean's stubborn ways, his inappropriate humor, those crushing looks of despair and doom and Dean's death, the man can play it all." [...] McCormick was described as [...] "creepy", leading to Charles' [...] "huge compliment" [...] of comparing the episode to The Twilight Zone. For the critic, the [...] "totally unexpected" [...] Bon Jovi sing-along [...] "totally rocked" [...] and has [...] "instantly become a classic". Her main disappointment with the episode, however, was the lack of Sam [...] "going dark side". Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune listed the episode as one of the [...] "gems" [...] of the third season, and believed it likely to end up as one of her [...] "Favorite 'Supernatural' Episodes of All Time". The San Diego Union-Tribunes Karla Peterson agreed, giving the episode a grade of A-. Although it [...] "got off to a shaky start with some weirdly paced scenes", it ended up a [...] "finale that wrapped us in sticky threads of old fears, mind-bending new business and one awesome Bon Jovi song".|$|E
2500|$|I {{definitely}} {{had a story}} for it – a specific story – that's why I {{felt that it was}} important for her and I to co-direct this particular video and song and she completely got it. She got my vision for it. She [...] got where I was trying to go and what she brings to the table is so incredible and she's so creative and outstanding. And I always have a great time working with her. There was no ego involved, you know, me - that was the first video that I'd ever <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> to literally co-direct. I'd always been very opinionated and very you know, I always voice my ideas and whatnot in my videos, {{but this was the first}} one I actually took credit for in co-directing. And she was just so great and generous in teaching me some of the ropes and learning about the different camera angles and you know, all the facets and details that go into making a video. So, she was really great and we had such fun with that. [...] And she's amazing. I can't you know, she came to the set dressed in different outfits that related to the circus everyday, so she's such an imaginative, creative spirit that I just have such fun working with energy like that.|$|E

[...] After {{defeating}} the Wellington Dukes {{to win the}} OPJHL crown, the Caps failed to win the Dudley Hewitt Cup for a berth in the Royal Bank Cup. [...] A year later, the Wellington Dukes rebounded their OPJHL final defeated from 2002 and won the 2003 Buckland Cup 4-games-to-2 over the Aurora Tigers. [...] The Dukes ventured to Fort Frances, Ontario for the Dudley Hewitt Cup. [...] After defeating the SIJHL's Fort Frances Borderland Thunder 7-1, they lost to the NOJHL's North Bay Skyhawks 2-1. [...] The Dukes came back and defeated the SIJHL's Thunder Bay Bulldogs 7-4 to earn a berth into the DHC semi-final. [...] In the semi-final, they defeated the Borderland Thunder 4-2 and then defeated North Bay 4-0 in the final to win the Central Canadian crown. [...] The Dukes {{then moved on to}} Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island for the Royal Bank Cup 2003. [...] The Dukes lost their first game 4-1 to the SJHL's Humboldt Broncos and lost again in their second game 7-1 to the AJHL's Camrose Kodiaks.

2500|$|The Astros had a coast-to-coast flight lasting {{six hours}} {{the night before}} game one of the NLCS and had to face Steve Carlton who had beaten the Astros six {{straight}} times. [...] With that said the experts gave the Phillies the edge in beating the Astros in game one of the NLCS. [...] The Phillies would win game one, but the Astros {{did not make it}} easy. The Astros went up 10 in the third and Astros pitcher Ken Borsch, who gave up four hits in the first three innings, settled down retiring the side 1-2-3 in the fourth and fifth innings. Pete Rose reached on an infield-hit inn the sixth, but Forsch went right back to work retiring the next two batters. [...] Then Greg Luzinski <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate.</b> [...] Luzinski worked Forsch to a full counted, fouled of the next pitch and then sent a bomb to 300 level seats of Veterans Stadium for a two-run homer. The Phillies added an insurance run in the next inning when Garry Maddox stole third and ex-Astro Greg Gross looped a single to left allowing Gross to score. [...] Tug McGraw came in for the eighth inning and the Astros went three up, three down. [...] Luis Pujols was able to work McGraw for a walk in the ninth, but that would be all the Astros would get from him as McGraw retired the next three batters leading the Phillies to a 31 and one game up in the series.|$|E
2500|$|The Twins {{surprisingly}} did quite {{poorly in}} 1990, finishing {{last in the}} AL West division {{with a record of}} 74–88, 29 games behind the Athletics, the eventual World Series runner-up. 1991 brought breakout years from newcomers Shane Mack, Scott Leius, Chili Davis, and rookie of the year Chuck Knoblauch, along with consistently excellent performances from stars Hrbek and Puckett. The pitching staff excelled as well, with 20-game winner Scott Erickson, closer Rick Aguilera, and newly acquired free agent, St. Paul native Jack Morris, having all-star years. The Twins defeated the Toronto Blue Jays in five games to win the 1991 ALCS and the Atlanta Braves 4 games to 3 to win the nail-biting 1991 World Series, which is {{considered by many to be}} the greatest of all time. Game 6 is widely considered to be one of the greatest World Series games ever played. Facing elimination, and with the score tied 3-3 in the bottom of the 11th inning, [...] <b>stepped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> and drove the game-winning home run into the left field seats to force a decisive Game 7. The home run was Puckett's only walk-off home run of his career. In the final and deciding game, Jack Morris pitched a 10-inning shutout, viewed by many baseball historians as one of the greatest pitching performances in a 7th game of the World Series, to beat the Braves 1–0 and bring home the championship to Minnesota. 1991 was considered to be the first season that any team that ended in last place the previous year advanced to the World Series; both the Twins and Braves accomplished the unprecedented feat. ESPN rated the 1991 World Series as the best ever played in a 2003 centennial retrospective of the World Series. As with the 1987 World Series, which the Twins also won, all 7 games were won by the home team.|$|E
