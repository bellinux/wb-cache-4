However, a forward looking consumer can buy in advance, thereby mostly undo the impact of the restriction.

I estimate a demand model which allows a fraction of consumers to be time inconsistent, using scanner data of beer purchases and other shopping behavior. According to the estimation results, 20 % of consumers are time inconsistent and they account for 64 % of beer consumption.

50|$|Many {{fish species}} congregate to {{facilitate}} spawning. Such congregations are spatially and temporally predictable {{and increase the}} species' vulnerability to overfishing. Species such as groupers and rabbitfishes travel long distances to congregate for days or weeks. Such gatherings are their only opportunities to reproduce and are crucial to population maintenance. Species such as snappers and parrotfishes congregate in feeding or resting areas. Juveniles may congregate in nursery areas without adults. Such special areas may require only seasonal protections if at other times no vital activities are taking place. Such reserves must be spaced to allow focal species to journey among them. If the location of such special areas is unknown, or is too large to include in a reserve, management approaches such as seasonal capture and <b>sales</b> <b>restrictions</b> may provide some protection. Sea turtle nesting areas, dugong feeding areas, cetacean migratory corridors and calving grounds are examples of other special areas that can be protected seasonally. Other types of special areas include isolated habitats that have unique assemblages and populations, habitats that are important for endemic species and highly diverse areas.|$|E
50|$|The turn of {{the century}} was to be {{something}} of a golden age for the Swedish brewing industry, a period which will probably never be equalled, at least not by the number of breweries. In 1905 there were a total of 240 beer breweries in Sweden. Every village or town had its own local brewery. After 1905 the number of breweries diminished gradually. A number of taxes, such as malttax, were imposed on the brewing business. These taxes were increased with time and later turned into tax of the finished product in 1940. The tax of the product was then increased gradually. Not only the taxes made life hard for the brewers but also tough <b>sales</b> <b>restrictions.</b> The trend has also developed towards nationalization of the brewing industry. The reason why, is that when the state had control over the production, it was also easier to control the consumption of beer. In this tough climate the beer industry was transformed from a small-scale to a large-scale industry with only a few production units.|$|E

After a 1975 facelift and some changes to the lineup, these lost the [...] "Firenza" [...] badges and were sold simply as the Chevrolet 1300 and 1900. The car was facelifted, with a new front design which mimicked that of the bigger Chevrolet 2500/3800/4100. These were originally only four-door saloons, but South Africa also saw a three-door hatch developed off this rather than taking on the then new Chevette/Kadett City; this was first shown in June 1976 and the first car rolled off the production line in August. This mixture used the T-car's rear hatch and taillights, but was a Viva ahead of the B-pillars. The arch around the rear hatch opening was considerably stronger than the T-car's, to suit local road conditions. Also, the 57 L was larger than one would expect from a car this size, to suit local road conditions and petrol <b>sales</b> <b>restrictions.</b> The split rear-seat folded down. With the new Chevrolet Chevair recently introduced, cost prohibitions made such a creation a better proposition than bringing in an all-new car.|$|E

Access to the engine cover for maintenance was provided by a hinged door of the same shape as the driver's door, but with an additional kerb-viewing window.

40|$|Abstract. We {{examine how}} the {{confusion}} and regulatory uncertainty generated by the imposition of short <b>sale</b> <b>restrictions</b> in September 2008 impacted equity option markets. We uncover four primary findings. First, investors seeking short exposure in financial stocks did not migrate to the option market to avoid the short sale ban. Second, the short <b>sale</b> <b>restrictions</b> are associated with increased bid ask spreads for options on banned stocks that are not solely attributable to inflated bid ask spreads on the underlying stocks. Indeed, on September 19, we estimate that liquidity demanding investors trading December 2008 expiration puts and callsth encountered bid ask spreads that were $ 1. 20 (24 %) wider than the bid ask spreads of options on comparable stocks with no short <b>sale</b> <b>restrictions.</b> We conservatively estimate that {{over the course of}} the ban, liquidity demanding investors trading options on banned stocks paid an additional $ 505 million in transactions costs due to inflated bid ask spreads. Third, synthetic share prices for banned stocks become significantly lower than actual share prices. Finally, we find the short sale ban increased the number of apparent arbitrage opportunities that involve the buying of synthetic shares and shorting of actual shares. Together, our results suggest trading costs in option markets increase dramatically and option and stock prices decouple when option market makers are not able to hedge easily and investors are unable to purchase short exposure. Our results also provide a reminder that regulations imposed in the middle of the night are likely to have unintended consequences tha...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In the Caucasus region {{country of}} Georgia, no data on public opinion {{regarding}} tobacco <b>sales</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{have been available}} until now. The aim {{of the study is}} to provide data from a nationally representative sample including non-smokers, ex-smokers and current smokers, on their level of support for restricting tobacco sales. METHODS: 1, 588 people aged 13 - 70 were interviewed at home about their level of agreement with eight possible tobacco <b>sales</b> <b>restrictions,</b> which were combined to create a dichotomous scale indicating low agreement (agree with none to three of eight restrictions) or high agreement (agree with four or more of eight restrictions). Levels of agreement were analyzed by demographic segments defined by age, gender, education and income and by tobacco use status. RESULTS: Across all eight forms of tobacco <b>sales</b> <b>restrictions,</b> the average support for tobacco <b>sales</b> <b>restrictions</b> was 85. 2 % which is a high level of support. Among smokers, 71 % of women and 87 % of men indicated a high level of agreement for restricted tobacco sales; among occasional smokers 54 % and 55 % respectively. Above 95 % of female and male ex-smokers and never smokers expressed high level of agreement with <b>sales</b> <b>restrictions.</b> After adjustment for other predictors, agreement was significantly associated with age (more agreement with higher age) and smoking status (more agreement among never-smokers, less in current smokers), while {{there were no significant differences}} in agreement by gender, education, and income. DISCUSSION: It is of high importance for Georgia to fully implement the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, including strong <b>sales</b> <b>restrictions,</b> and there is good evidence of public support for doing so. CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate to Georgian public health authorities that the support for tightened tobacco <b>sales</b> <b>restrictions</b> is high. </p...|$|E

40|$|Many US {{states and}} Canadian provinces have {{recently}} lifted bans on off-premise retail liquor sales on Sundays, {{yet there is}} no evidence on how such provisions affect drinking. We investigate this issue using unique information on day-specific alcohol consumption from Canada’s National Population Health Surveys (1994 - 1999) and variation across provinces {{in the presence of a}} Sunday <b>sales</b> <b>restriction.</b> In a cross-sectional regression approach, we find that allowing Sunday alcohol sales is associated with more drinking on Sundays but no difference in drinking on other days of the week. To account for unobserved factors that may be associated with both the presence of a Sunday <b>sales</b> <b>restriction</b> and lower Sunday drinking rates (such as religiosity), we use quasi-experimental variation induced by Ontario’s 1997 repeal of its Sunday sales ban.

In particular, some states have regulations that allow only licensed funeral homes to sell caskets, while others allow unlicensed retailers, such as Costco, to sell them. However, as caskets and funeral services are complements, generally purchased in one-to-one proportions, it is not a priori clear that casket <b>sales</b> <b>restrictions</b> can expand the rent extraction capabilities of licensed funeral homes. Our results suggest that when courts lift funeral goods <b>sales</b> <b>restrictions,</b> the prices of funeral goods fall but the prices of funeral services rise by nearly as much.

40|$|Abstract: We analyze {{cross-sectional}} {{and time}} series information from fortyseven equity markets around the world, {{to consider whether}} short–sales restrictions affect {{the efficiency of the}} market, and the distributional characteristics of returns to individual stocks and market indices. Using the approach developed in Mørck et al. (2000) we find significantly more crosssectional variation in equity returns in markets where short selling is feasible and practiced, controlling for a host of other factors. This evidence is consistent with more efficient price discovery at the individual security level. A common conjecture by regulators is that short–sales restrictions can reduce the relative severity of a market panic. We test this conjecture by examining the skewness of market returns. We find that in markets where short selling is either prohibited or not practiced, individual stock returns display significantly less negative skewness. However, at the market level, where regulators might expect short– <b>sales</b> <b>restrictions</b> to reduce the severity of broad declines, short <b>sales</b> <b>restrictions</b> appear to make no difference.
