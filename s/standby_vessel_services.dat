50|$|On 7 July 2014, the Finnish {{newspaper}} Turun Sanomat {{reported that}} Arctech Helsinki Shipyard had been awarded {{the construction of}} three icebreaking <b>standby</b> <b>vessels</b> for Sovcomflot. The shipyard confirmed the US$380 million order for three ships, initially scheduled for delivery between September 2016 and March 2017, in its own press release on 11 August 2014. Like the platform supply vessel ordered in April, the <b>standby</b> <b>vessels</b> would be chartered to Sakhalin Energy Investment Company (SEIC) and used in the Sakhalin-2 field for stand-by, rescue and oil spill response duties. The 100 m vessels Stepan Makarov, Fedor Ushakov, and Mikhail Lazarev will have accommodation for 98 persons on board and be capable of operating independently in 1.7 m ice. The keel of the first <b>standby</b> <b>vessel</b> was laid on 4 February 2016. This {{is the first time}} Arctech Helsinki Shipyard is building two vessels simultaneously in the covered dry dock. Some of the blocks have been assembled in KlaipÄ—da, Lithuania. The first vessel, Stepan Makarov, was floated out in November 2016 and delivered on 15 June 2017. All three vessels are now scheduled to be delivered in 2017 with an interval of two to three months.|$|R

40|$|In this Master?s thesis an {{optimization}} model for finding the optimal {{design of a}} standby base operating in remote regions is presented. The research and development within optimization of <b>standby</b> <b>vessel</b> design is limited. The objective of this thesis has been to utilize {{the state of the}} art within the areas of maritime fleet optimization, ship design optimization and the analytical hierarchy process in the development of a working model. Application of emergency preparedness assessment processes in the North Sea as quantifiable mathematical restrictions is also addressed. By developing a linear {{optimization model}}, and implementing it into optimization software, a possible solution in finding the optimal design of a standby base has been approached. The scope of the thesis has been to find the basic design of the standby base, its attributes and the fleet of cooperating <b>standby</b> <b>vessels</b> with the minimum total cost and satisfactory emergency preparedness. As an addition, the model has also been extended with a weighted objective function considering the trade-off between cost and emergency preparedness. In order to investigate the behavior of the model in producing the optimal design and functionality of a standby base, it was tested on a case study for future petroleum development near Jan Mayen. The results revealed a significant cost reduction when the standby base was implemented as apposed to only <b>standby</b> <b>vessels.</b> It also revealed that different design options proved more appropriate as a standby base when the data was run for the original model and the weighted objective function extension. Because of the limited state of the art connected to optimizing the design of <b>standby</b> <b>vessels,</b> the model in this thesis is a version of what I consider to be a possible way of developing a tool in aiding naval architects. Because of the model?s use of expert judgments, obtaining applicable results demands extensive work connected to data pre-processing. </p...|$|R
