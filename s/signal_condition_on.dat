Each agent may face an {{identification}} problem in the sense that she cannot distinguish the truth in isolation. However, by communicating with each other, agents are able to benefit from side observations to learn the truth collectively. Unlike many distributed algorithms which rely on all-time communication protocols, we propose an efficient method by switching between Bayesian and non-Bayesian regimes. In this model, agents exchange information only when their private signals are not informative enough; thence, by switching between the two regimes, agents efficiently learn the truth using only a few rounds of communications. The proposed algorithm preserves learnability while incurring a lower communication cost. We also verify our theoretical findings by simulation examples.

In this paper, we derive a low complex {{decoding}} metric for space-time block (STB) codes over quasi-static (slowly changing) {{flat fading}} channels with partial knowledge of channel state information (CSI).

A channel estimator is assumed to provide us with an unbiased channel estimate with a certain error variance and the exact decoder metric is calculated for this case. By including the variance of the channel estimation error in the decoder metric derivation of the STB codes, we derive the exact probability density function (pdf) of the received <b>signals</b> <b>conditioned</b> <b>on</b> the estimated channel fading coefficients and transmitted sym-bol sequences.

We also assume that the classifier knows only a mismatched version of the parameters of input distribution in lieu of the true parameters. By constructing an asymptotic low-noise expansion of an upper bound to the error probability of such a mismatched classifier, we provide sufficient conditions for reliable classification in the low-noise regime that are able to sharply predict the absence of a classification error floor. Such conditions are a function of the geometry of the true signal distribution, the geometry of the mismatched signal distributions as well as the interplay between such geometries, namely, the principal angles and the overlap between the true and the mismatched signal subspaces.

Hereby, a simulator is used instead of a NVNA to extract the X-parameters. Assuming that the interfering signals are relatively small compared to the nominal input signal, the output signal can be described as a superposition of the effects of each input signal. In order to determine the functional correlation between the scattering variables, a polynomial dependency is assumed. The required datasets for the approximation of the describing functions are simulated by a directional coupler model in Cadence Design Framework.

40|$|Abstract. Bayesian {{motion control}} and {{planning}} {{is based on}} the idea of fusing motion objectives (constraints, goals, priors, etc) using probabilistic inference techniques in a way similar to Bayesian sensor fusing. This approach seems promising for tackling two fundamental problems in robotic control and planning: (1) Bayesian inference methods are an ideal candidate for fusing many sources of information or constraints – usually employed in the sensor processing context. Complex motion is characterised by such a multitude of concurrent constraints and tasks and the Bayesian approach provides a solution of which classical solutions (e. g., prioritised inverse kinematics) are a special case. (2) In the future we will require planning methods that are not based on representing the system state as one high-dimensional state variable but rather cope with structured state representations (distributed, hierarchical, hybrid discrete-continuous) that more directly reflect and exploit the natural structure of the environment. Probabilistic inference offers methods that can in principle handle such representations. Our approach will, for the first time, allow to transfer these methods to the realm of motion control and planning. The first part of this technical report will review standard optimal (motion rate or dynamic) control from an optimisation perspective and then derive Bayesian versions of the classical solutions. The new control laws show that motion control can be framed as an inference problem in an appropriately formulated probabilistic model. In the second part, by extending the probabilistic models to be Markovian models of the whole trajectory, we show that probabilistic inference methods (belief propagation) yield solutions to motion planning problems. This approach computes a posterior distribution over trajectories and control <b>signals</b> <b>conditioned</b> <b>on</b> goals and constraints. ...|$|R

Time series of hot-wire data are decomposed into large- and small-scale components, and the impact of the large scale on the amplitude and frequency of the small scales is considered. The amplitude modulation effect is examined by conditionally averaging the small-scale intensity () for various values of the large-scale fluctuation (). It is shown that increases with increasing value of in the near-wall region, whereas, farther away from the wall, decreases with increasing. The rate of increase in small-scale intensity with the strength of the large-scale signal is neither symmetric (about) nor linear. The extent of the frequency modulation is examined by counting the number of occurrences of local maxima or minima in the small-scale signal. It is shown that the frequency modulation effect is confined to the near-wall region and its extent diminishes rapidly beyond. A phase lag between the large- and small-scale fluctuations, in terms of amplitude modulation, has also been identified, which is in agreement with previous studies. The phase lag between large- and small-scale fluctuations for frequency modulation is comparable to that of amplitude modulation in the near-wall region.

Finally, we constructed a clean vicK knockout mutant, which proved to be more sensitive to H 2 O 2 than the wild-type. In conclusion, this study showed that the VicRK system responds to and protects against oxidative stress. As a result, a link between oxidative/redox stress and the cariogenic nature of S. mutans can be hypothesized...|$|R
