5|$|In 1938, Göring was {{involved}} in the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair, which led to the resignations of the War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, and the army commander, General Werner von Fritsch. Göring had acted as witness at Blomberg's wedding to Margarethe Gruhn, a 26-year-old typist, on 12 January 1938. Information received from the police showed that the young bride was a prostitute. Göring felt obligated to tell Hitler, but also saw this event as an opportunity to dispose of the field marshal. Blomberg was forced to resign. Göring did not want Fritsch to be appointed to that position and thus be his superior. Several days later, Heydrich revealed a file on Fritsch that contained allegations of homosexual activity and blackmail. The charges were later proven to be false, but Fritsch had lost Hitler's trust and was forced to resign. Hitler used the dismissals as an opportunity to reshuffle the leadership of the military. Göring asked for the post of War Minister, but was turned down; he was appointed to the rank of field marshal. Hitler took over as supreme commander of the armed forces and created <b>subordinate</b> <b>posts</b> to head the three main branches of service.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Chamberlain and Lloyd George was thenceforth one of hatred, with Chamberlain calling Lloyd George [...] "that dirty little Welsh Attorney" [...] and being implacably opposed to Lloyd George joining the National Government in the 1930s. Austen Chamberlain, {{the brother of}} one opponent and, for a time, the political ally of the other, regretted the enmity, [...] "More's the pity, for together if they were together they might do a great deal." [...] Lloyd George would later paint a most unflattering portrait of Chamberlain in his 1935 War Memoirs, claiming that “Mr Chamberlain {{is a man of}} rigid competency. Such men have their uses in conventional times … and are indispensable for filling <b>subordinate</b> <b>posts</b> at all times. But they are lost in an emergency or in creative tasks at any time.” HIs dislike of Chamberlain is sometimes said to have been based on phrenology, although little contemporary evidence has been found to confirm this. Lloyd George would also have the last laugh in May 1940, when his speech in the Norway Debate helped bring down Chamberlain’s government.|$|E
60|$|He {{was thirty}} {{years of age and}} a {{railroad}} builder, though he hardly thought he had much talent for his profession. Hard work and stubborn perseverance had carried him on up to the present, but it looked as if he could not go much farther. It was eight years since he began by joining a shovel gang, and he felt the lack of scientific training. He might continue to fill <b>subordinate</b> <b>posts,</b> but the men who came to the front had been taught by famous engineers and held certificates.|$|E

6000|$|With all his {{hatred for}} the book-man in politics, Burke owed {{much of his}} own {{distinction}} to that generous richness and breadth of judgment which had been ripened in him by literature and his practice in it. Like some other men in our history, he showed that books are a better preparation for statesmanship than early training in the <b>subordinate</b> <b>posts</b> and among the permanent officials of a public department. There is no copiousness of literary reference in his works, such as over-abounded in civil and ecclesiastical publicists of the seventeenth century. Nor can we truly {{say that there is}} much, though there is certainly some, of that tact, which literature is alleged to confer on those who approach it in a just spirit and with the true gift. The influence of literature on Burke lay partly in the direction of emancipation from the mechanical formulae of practical politics; partly in the association which it engendered, in a powerful understanding like his, between politics and the moral forces of the world, and between political maxims and the old and great sentences of morals; partly in drawing him, even when resting his case on prudence and expediency, to appeal to the widest and highest sympathies; partly, and more than all, in opening his thoughts to the many conditions, possibilities, and [...] "varieties of untried being" [...] in human character and situation, and so giving an incomparable flexibility to his methods of political approach.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is curious}} to find that, {{in the midst}} of his beneficent administration, Turgot was rating {{practical}} work very low in comparison with the achievements of the student and the thinker. 'You are very fortunate,' Condorcet said to him, 'in having a passion for the public good, and in being able to satisfy it; it is a great consolation, and of a very superior order to the consolation of mere study.' 'Nay,' replied Turgot, in his next letter, 'whatever you may say, I believe that the satisfaction derived from study is superior to any other kind of satisfaction. I am perfectly convinced that one may be, through study, a thousand times more useful to men than in any of our <b>subordinate</b> <b>posts.</b> There we torment ourselves, and often without any compensating success, to secure some small benefits, while we are the involuntary instrument of evils that are by no means small. All our small benefits are transitory, while the light that a man of letters is able to diffuse must, sooner or later, destroy all the artificial evils of the human race, and place it in a position to enjoy all the goods that nature offers.' It is clear that we can only accept Turgot's preference, on condition that the man of letters is engaged on work that seriously advances social interests and adds something to human stature. Most literature, nearly all literature, is distinctly subordinate and secondary; it only serves to pass the time of the learned or cultured class, without making any definite mark either on the mental habits of men and women, or on the institutions under which they live. Compared with such literature as this, the work of an administrator who makes life materially easier and more hopeful to the half-million of persons living in the Generality of Limoges or elsewhere, must be pronounced emphatically the worthier and more justly satisfactory.[44] ...|$|E
50|$|Abandoning {{his first}} {{intention}} of entering the Jesuit order, he studied medicine at Madrid, found {{an opening in}} politics as {{a supporter of the}} Moderate party, and, after occupying several <b>subordinate</b> <b>posts,</b> became governor of Castellón de la Plana, of Alicante and of Valencia. His conservative tendencies grew more pronounced with time, and his Polémicas con la Democracia (1862) may be taken as the definitive expression of his political opinions.|$|E
5000|$|He {{is said to}} {{have been}} vain, suspicious, hot-tempered, and jealous; at any rate he resented his <b>subordinate</b> <b>post</b> and went to Madrid about 1661 (Cean Bermúdez). Before leaving his native city he painted two large {{pictures}} for the cathedral and a [...] "St. Francis" [...] for the chapel of this saint. Edmund Walker Head declares the latter to be his masterpiece.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Friedrich was {{appointed}} to a <b>subordinate</b> <b>post</b> in the municipal library of Leipzig.

50|$|Tilt {{acted as}} {{travelling}} physician {{in the family}} of Count Pyotr Andreyevich Shuvalov during 1848-50. He settled in London about 1850, devoting himself to midwifery and the diseases of women: he had learned from Joseph Récamier in Paris {{the use of the}} speculum in gynaecology. In his practice Tilt opposed excessive surgery; but accepted some applications of clitoridectomy and leeches. He was then appointed physician-accoucheur to the Farringdon general dispensary and lying-in charity. He was one of the original fellows of the Obstetrical Society of London, where he took on <b>subordinate</b> <b>posts,</b> and was elected president for 1874-5.|$|E
50|$|Born about 1778, he {{was educated}} in England.

Some work of some sort would be found for her. And she would sink into the routine of her job, as did so many women, and grow old and die, chattering and fluttering. She would have what is called her independence. But, seriously faced with that treasure, and without the option of refusing it, strange how hideous she found it.|$|R
50|$|In 1826, on the {{completion}} of his musical education under Thomas Attwood, and subsequently under François-Joseph Fétis in Paris, that he took his place {{as a member of}} major orchestras of London, such as the Philharmonic and the Ancient Concerts. The Saltoun Club of Instrumentalists and the Società Lirica were perhaps founded by him as early as this period of his life. They were intended for the practice and performance of unfamiliar operatic music. He played in the orchestra on the occasion of Carl Maria von Weber's funeral, 21 June 1826. Around this time he was appointed to a <b>subordinate</b> <b>post</b> at the Royal Academy of Music, and became musical editor of the Athenæum and other papers.|$|R
5000|$|Mahmud Nedim Pasha ( [...] 1818 [...] - [...] 14 May 1883) was an Ottoman statesman of Georgian origin. He {{was the son}} of Mehmed Necib Pasha, a governor-general of Baghdad. After occupying various <b>subordinate</b> <b>posts</b> at the Porte, {{he became}} under-secretary of state for foreign affairs, governor-general of Damascus and İzmir (Smyrna), {{minister}} of commerce, and governor-general of Tripoli. He was also successively Minister of Justice and Minister of the Navy in 1869, and ultimately grand vizier (identical to a prime minister {{at this point in the}} Empire) twice from 1871 to 1872 and from 1875 to 1876.|$|E
50|$|He {{has been}} known to {{cooperate}} with other evil beings, gaining allies or even being them. In The Crystal Shard he chooses to ally himself with the wizard Akar Kessel, on the promise that when Kessel died (which would not be far in the future in Errtu's view, even if Kessel died of old age), he would gain Crenshinibon. In Siege of Darkness, he became a reluctant ally of the drow goddess Lolth — at first because she could obliterate him if he did not cooperate, and later because she offered him a chance to gain total, personal revenge on Drizzt. On a few occasions he offers <b>subordinate</b> <b>posts</b> to lesser demons to ensure their aid.|$|E
50|$|Consulates are <b>subordinate</b> <b>posts</b> {{of their}} home country's {{diplomatic}} mission (typically an embassy, {{in the capital city}} of the host country). Diplomatic missions are established in international law under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, while consulates-general and consulates are established in international law under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Formally, at least within the US system, the consular career (ranking in descending order: consul-general, consul, vice-consul, honorary consul) forms a different hierarchy from the diplomats in the strict sense. However, it is common for individuals to be transferred from one hierarchy to the other, and for consular officials to serve in a capital carrying out strictly consular duties within the consular section of a diplomatic post; e.g., within an embassy.|$|E

Montt distinguished himself by his courage in the crisis that followed upon Portales' assassination in 1837, though only holding a <b>subordinate</b> <b>post</b> in the government. In 1840, Montt {{was elected to the}} National Congress of Chile. He served as minister of the interior and minister of justice under President Manuel Bulnes (1841-51).

This appointment, which is said to have been due to the influence of the Jesuits, was by no means a fortunate one, as the new president was far more fit to fill a <b>subordinate</b> <b>post</b> than that of superior.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{his return}} to Washington in September 1907, General Sharpe {{submitted}} recommendations to the War Department urging {{the establishment of a}} supply corps. While these were not adopted, they undoubtedly proved helpful when the subject of consolidating the Quartermaster, Subsistence, and Pay Departments into one agency was being considered four years later. Sharpe was so enthusiastic about establishing a consolidated supply corps that Quartermaster General James B. Aleshire called him the father of consolidation. Many of Sharpe's friends recommended that he be selected to head the newly created Quartermaster Corps in 1912. But when his classmate, General Aleshire, was appointed, Sharpe accepted a <b>subordinate</b> <b>post</b> in the Corps and worked devotedly to prove the value of consolidation.|$|R

In 1543, when Henry and Charles were in alliance and an English force was ordered to co-operate with the imperialists in the north of France, the Earl of Surrey supposed he should have the command; but, to his disappointment, it was given to Wallop, with Sir Thomas Seymour as his marshal; Surrey had to accept a <b>subordinate</b> <b>post.</b> The expedition effected little, though the soldiers were long in the field.

The OG interface uses a tree structure; putting the new <b>posts</b> in a <b>subordinate</b> <b>post</b> relationship to a previous post. How these two technologies present the posts to the user was felt by the experimenter to cause quantifiable differences.
