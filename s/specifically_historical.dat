40|$|In this article, the allegorical {{narrative}} is examined {{as a type}} of extended metaphor in which one simultaneous or parallel narrative structure is maintained together with another, one less “visible” or literal than the other. Three American novels of the period of the Vietnam War are analyzed as examples of allegorical narratives: Asa Baber’s The Land of a Million Elephants (1971); Robert Stone’s Dog Soldiers (1967), and Norman Mailer’s Why Are We in Vietnam? (1967).

40|$|My {{question}} for now is: {{in what ways}} have the new currents of transnationality affected existing forms of cultural sensibility in the ‘post-colony’? Realised as a system of representation of the global popular, recent articulations of popular experience tend to be absorbed into generic cross-cultural media representations shared on the glocal level of operation by cultural producers, consumers and practitioners across geographical borders. In this paper, I shall focus on the changing spectacle of ‘the local’ through its cinematic action (along with its alternative heroine mediation), in light of such a transnational articulation as the emerging dominant. My purpose is to examine how local action has been re-imagined and can be re-aligned {{in relation to the}} <b>specifically</b> <b>historical,</b> national and postcolonial mode of imagination under the contemporary glocal context of the Hong Kong ‘Special Administrative Region’ (HKSAR), as this particular post-colony is officially renamed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{sits at the}} {{intersection}} of the rivalry, war duration, and bargaining literatures, suggesting that histories of armed conflict between states increase war duration through their effects on the selectorate and the wartime bargaining process. I argue that the historical relationship between two states plays an integral role in the duration of future conflict. <b>Specifically,</b> <b>historical</b> conflict between states intensifies the preference of national selectorates for military victory and narrows the range of negotiated settlements that leaders might pursue while still maintaining domestic political support. I employ Bennett and Stam’s (1996) ex ante data set and Crescenzi and Enterline’s (2001) International Interaction Score to provide an empirical test of the generalizability of appropriately coded historical interaction to the topic of war duration. Contradicting earlier studies, the results of this analysis show that a properly operationalized measure of rivalry has significant and positive effects on war duration...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the next}} century, climate change will {{dramatically}} alter natural resource management. <b>Specifically,</b> <b>historical</b> reference conditions {{may no longer}} serve as benchmarks for restoration, which may foster a “why bother? ” attitude toward ecological restoration. We review the potential role for riparian restoration to prepare ecological systems for the threats posed by climate change. Riparian ecosystems are naturally resilient, provide linear habitat connectivity, link aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and create thermal refugia for wildlife: all characteristics that can contribute to ecological adaptation to climate change. Because riparian systems and the projected impacts of climate change are highly variable geographically, there is a pressing {{need to develop a}} place-based understanding of climate change threats to riparian ecosystems. Restoration practitioners should consider how they can modify practices to enhance the resilience of riparian ecosystems to climate change. Such modifications may include accelerating the restoration of private lands, participating in water management decisions, and putting the emerging field of restoration genetics into practice...|$|E
40|$|This article makes a {{theoretical}} {{contribution to the}} constructivist and cultural political economy literatures on crisis. While these new approaches have highlighted the imaginary dimensions of crisis, they have neglected the <b>specifically</b> <b>historical</b> forms of imagination through which events are construed and constructed as crises. In particular, {{they have yet to}} adequately theorise how the recollection of prior crises might interact with efforts to diagnose and resolve a crisis in some later present. I respond to this lacuna by developing a novel set of tools for analysing the metahistorical dimensions of crisis. These include a typology that identifies three distinct ways of recalling past crises, and a concept of ‘history-production’, which captures how different interpretive practices feed into the diagnosis and negotiation of crisis episodes. Taken together these tools help illuminate a complex interaction not only between historical analogies, narratives, and lessons, but also between these representational modes and the imaginary dimensions of crisis...|$|E

My study is assuming that Risalah Nur plays an important role when the tariqa, mysticism/tasawuf teachings banned by the Turkish government since 1925. For some Muslim scholars the Risalah Nur written in Arabic and Turkish is considered as the treasures of Islamic knowledge in Turkey. In fact, the Risalah Nur is supposed to be a role model of the Islamic teachings in Muslim world in which the manuscript represents the essential contents of the Quran. The Risalah Nur is strongly referred to Sufism, which deals with the universal value of peace and love that must be relevant for Muslims and all human beings from time to time...|$|E

40|$|As {{pressure}} to develop on hillsides underlain by landslides increases, detailed pre-development geological and geotechnical-engineering {{studies are needed}} to understand landslide stability. Research on historical landslides by the Utah Geological Survey (UGS) provides insights into landslide behavior, and the results of detailed pre-development landslide-stability studies should be consistent with these research results. <b>Specifically,</b> <b>historical</b> landslide behavior contradicts some geologic evidence commonly cited to demonstrate the stability of pre-existing landslides, such as subdued geomorphic expression and natural buttressing. Similarly, although geotechnical-engineering analyses in Utah commonly indicate that Holocene-age landslides have adequate stability for development, historical landsliding indicates that Holocene landslides are commonly near a threshold of instability where slight increases in ground-water levels induce movement. Also, relative to determining minimum safe setback distances above and below landslides, historical landsliding has demonstrated that damaging deformation may occur downslope beyond the toe of the landslide, landslides may enlarge upslope beyond a setback based on main-scarp stability, and multiple failure types must generally be considered in estimating runout distances and setbacks from the base of slopes. Stability analyses of landslides must objectively assess the likelihood of renewed movement, including relatively minor but still damaging movement. Also, all likely types of failure should be modeled based on historical occurrences and geologic conditions, and considered in stability analyses and mitigation recommendations...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{cultural}} {{work has}} engaged {{the interest of}} scholars from {{a broad range of}} social science and humanities disciplines. The debate in this ‘turn to cultural work’ has largely been based around its advantages and disadvantages: its precariousness, its informal nature, the inequalities within its global workforce, and the blurring of work–life boundaries leading to ‘self-exploitation’. While academic critics have persuasively challenged more optimistic accounts of ‘converged’ worlds of creative production, the debate on cultural work has leant heavily towards suggesting a profoundly new confluence of forces and effects. Theorizing Cultural Work instead views cultural work through a <b>specifically</b> <b>historical</b> lens, to ask: what novelty can we actually attach to current conditions, and precisely what relation does cultural work have to social precedent? The contributors to this volume explore the history, transformations and future of work within the cultural and creative industries as they move into an uncertain future. This book challenges more affirmative and proselytising industry and academic perspectives, and the pervasive cult of novelty that surrounds them, to locate cultural work as an historically and geographically situated process. It will be of interest to students and scholars of sociology, cultural studies, human geography, urban studies and industrial relations, as well as management and business studies, cultural and economic policy and development, government and planning. ...|$|E
