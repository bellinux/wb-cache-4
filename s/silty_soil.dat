40|$|Along the European coasts, dune massifs are {{characterized}} by numerous settlements with great ecological value in relation to phreatic water. Since about twenty years, pioneer and grassy species of those settlements are subjected to substantial decline. Dune massif of Hatainville is a perfect sample of this regressive trend. Protection of scarce grassy species requires a better knowledge of soils and their dynamics. Pedological investigation {{has been carried out}} concerning unexpected <b>silty</b> <b>soils</b> of massif dune slacks. These soils are original insofar as they own richest pioneer and grassy species, as Apium Repens, Littorella uniflora, Gentianella amarella, Pyrola rotundifolia). Origin and ecological value of the <b>silty</b> <b>soils</b> have been cleared by analytic data. Thoses <b>silty</b> <b>soils</b> are the result of the pedogenesis of the characeae deposits. The presence of characeae depends of the dune slack flood from rising of the local groundwater. However, pedologial development (primary and secondary carbonatation, crumb structure) and the topographic position of biogene silts rarely flooded show us that those silts come from ancient elements and result of higher level of groundwater surface. It seems that the decrease of groundwater is due to climatic change during the last thirty years. The rainfalls and potential evapotranspiration trends show a increase of the potential evapotranspiration more considerable than rainfalls. The rise of potential evapotraspiration, probably due to the global climatic change, could explain the decrease of the local groundwater. Therefore, the hydrological conditions for the development of characeae and for the forming of <b>silty</b> <b>soils</b> are disappeared.

40|$|Kandelia candel, a {{dominant}} plant species in Hong Kong mangroves, had different growth strategies during its seedling stage for acclimation to various soil types. Leaves of the seedlings grown in sandy soils (coarse texture) were significantly thicker {{than those in}} loamy-sandy and <b>silty</b> <b>soils</b> (fine texture). However, leaf weight per unit leaf area of seedlings grown in sandy soils {{was similar to that}} in loamy-sandy soils and was 1. 60 times that in <b>silty</b> <b>soils.</b> These indicate that K. candel in sandy soils had developed a more loose leaf structure and a xerophilous characteristic during its seedling stage for acclimation to the features of coarse textured soils, which were low water holding capacity and low mineral content. In addition, for young seedlings grown in sandy and loamy-sandy soils, more biomass was allocated to roots than in <b>silty</b> <b>soils,</b> indicating that K. candel seedlings in sandy soils developed stronger roots for anchorage and water absorption; another xerophilous characteristic to acclimate to loose and coarse textured soils. As the plants became more mature, no significant difference in leaf thickness of the saplings was found between loamy-sandy and sandy soils. In order to acclimate to the low water holding capacity in sandy soils, K. candel seedlings had lower physiological activities including lower chlorophyll content; lower activities of root oxidase, nitrate reductase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase but higher malonaldehyde contents than those in <b>silty</b> <b>soils.</b> Canopy shade is an important factor affecting the growth and physiology of K. candel. The seedling grew worse under the mangrove canopy than that in the open gap, with smaller leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf number and biomass. The seedlings under the canopy eventually died and no saplings were found under canopy shade, implying K. candel is a shade intolerant species and canopy shade might "force" its newly recruited individuals to expand out of the forest. ¬© Springer 2005...|$|R
50|$|The California Development Company {{was formed}} in 1896 as a {{replacement}} for the defunct Colorado River Irrigation Company, which had been started a few years earlier for the purpose of planning an irrigation system for the lower Colorado Desert in California. The rich, <b>silty</b> <b>soil</b> of the area was found to be suitable for agriculture, but wells tapping groundwater brought up an inadequate supply of water for such a hot, arid region. The California Development Company took over the project of diverting Colorado River water into the Coachella and Imperial Valleys in the Salton Sink, a dry lake bed which today contains the Salton Sea, hoping to turn the desert green with agricultural fields. The first canals were being constructed by 1900 under the guidance of chief engineer George Chaffey.|$|E
50|$|The Missouri Rhineland is a {{geographical}} area of Missouri that extends from west of St. Louis to slightly east of Jefferson City, located {{mostly in the}} Missouri River Valley {{on both sides of}} the river. It is named for its similarities to the Rhineland region in central Europe, a wine growing area around the Rhine river and the German-Americans who determined that this part of Missouri would be good for grape growing. The soils of the Missouri River Valley and surrounding areas are mainly rocky residual soils, which are excellent for viticulture (growing of grapes/vineyards) though poor for most agricultural purposes. These soils were left after the carbonate (mainly limestone) bedrock weathered away to impurities of clayey soil and chert fragments. Farther to the north, glacial deposits and wind-deposited loess, a <b>silty</b> <b>soil</b> also associated with the glaciers, are intermingled with the residual soils.|$|E
50|$|Spalding {{is located}} at the centre of a major region of flower and {{vegetable}} cultivation, due to the rich <b>silty</b> <b>soil,</b> which mainly comprises drained, recovered marshland or estuary. There are many garden centres and plant nurseries, as well as a thriving agricultural industry and various vegetable packing plants. The main vegetables are potatoes, peas, carrots, wheat, barley, oats, broccoli, spinach, lettuce, cabbage, kale and Brussels sprouts. The vast majority of these are sold to large concerns such as supermarkets, with little being available for sale locally. Spalding has a popular, reasonably-sized, market every Tuesday and Saturday and on the first Saturday in every month a Farmers' Market. Local fruit and vegetable shop Booth's sells lots of local produce to Spalding's citizens. They sell all major fruit and vegetables ranging from the famous, locally grown 'Boston' potatoes to imported rarities such as custard apples.|$|E

The tunnel is made to flex and bend, similar to the way tall buildings are constructed to react if an earthquake hits. Floodgates at the joints of the tunnel are able to close and isolate water in the event of the walls' failure.|$|E
