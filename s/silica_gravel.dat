5000|$|Large-scale {{production}} of phosphorus uses the Wöhler process. [...] In this process, apatites (nearly always fluorapatite) are reduced {{in the presence}} of carbon (coke) and <b>silica</b> (<b>gravel).</b> This is performed in a submerged-arc furnace at temperatures of between 1150 and 1400C. The main internal reaction is described below: ...|$|E
50|$|Gravity {{delivers}} the apatite ore, carbon (coke) and <b>silica</b> (<b>gravel)</b> to the submerged-arc furnace through feed chutes {{situated in the}} roof of the furnace. This ensures a constant packed bed volume. The gaseous product, a mixture of carbon monoxide and phosphorus gas, leaves the furnace through two symmetrically placed outlet vents situated above the ferrophosphorus tap hole in {{the roof of the}} furnace. The ferrophosphorus is tapped off, usually once per day. Slag, however, is continuously tapped through two alternating, water-cooled tap holes located 400 mm above the furnace floor. The feed material forms the major electrical and flow resistance of the smelting furnace circuit. As the feed materials descend towards the hot zone in the furnace, they start to soften and melt, significantly lowering the electrical resistance. A conductive path is thus provided between the electrodes where the Joule heating is released to attain the high temperatures and energy levels needed to effect the essential endothermic reactions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} the transport of suspended particles (SP) in a saturated porous media, aimed at delineating the effects of pore structure on particle transport and deposition rate. Two porous media (<b>silica</b> <b>gravel</b> and glass beads) and silt SP were used. Breakthrough curves (BTCs) were well described by analytical solution of an advective-dispersive equation with a first-order deposition kinetic. The recovery rate of suspended particles is higher in the glass beads even if the porosities are similar. This study shows the importance of pore distribution in transport processes of suspended particles...|$|E

40|$|Concretes {{consisting}} of portland cement (OPC), <b>silica</b> sand, <b>gravel,</b> water, and recycled PET particles were developed. Specimens without PET particles {{were prepared for}} comparison. Curing times, PET particle sizes, and aggregate concentrations were varied. The compressive strength, compressive strain at yield point, and Young modulus were determined. Morphological and chemical compositions of recycled PET particles were seen in a scanning electron microscopy. Results show that smaller PET particle sizes in lower concentrations generate improvements on compressive strength and strain, and Young’s modulus decreases when the size of PET particles used was increased...|$|R
40|$|National audienceAn {{experimental}} study which aimed at investigating the transport behaviour of suspended particles in saturated porous media is presented. A short-pulse technique {{was used for}} measuring particle recovery and collision efficiencies in two porous media (<b>silica</b> <b>gravel</b> and glass beads). Breakthrough curves (BTCs) were measured on-line and well described by analytical solution of an advective-dispersive equation with a first-order deposition kinetic. The effects of hydrodynamic and gravity forces on particle transport and deposition rate were delineated. Results show particles travelling faster than the conservative tracer. The recovery rate of the suspended particles decreased with decreasing flow rate, and the deposition rate presents unexpected changes, depending on the flow rate...|$|E
40|$|Passive {{treatment}} of acid mine drainage (AMD) {{have been applied}} successfully at many sites where metal concentrations are relatively low, but experience is scarce for waters with higher metal loads. In this study, we tested the suitability of caustic magnesia (MgO) as an alkaline reagent at field scale, with and without a prior calcite dissolution step. Three pilot systems where tested at the “Monte Romero ” mine (Southwest Spain). One treatment tank {{was filled with a}} mix of MgO and <b>silica</b> <b>gravel</b> only, while a second one contained two layers of calcite followed by one of MgO. The third tank was similar to a reducing and alkalinity producing system (RAPS). It contained layers of calcite mixed with sheep manure followed by MgO mixed with <b>silica</b> <b>gravel.</b> The RAPS received water with an very high acidity of up to 29000 mg/L as CaCO 3 equivalents, while inflow acidity of the other two tanks was around 2380 mg/L as CaCO 3. The tank which contained only MgO had severe clogging problems from the beginning, and showed a poor chemical performance. The tank containing calcite and MgO and the RAPS removed high portions of Al and Cu, but only small to insignificant portions of Fe and Zn. Aeration and decantation improved the removal of Fe. Calcite eliminated acidity more effectively than MgO. Nevertheless, the calcite and magnesia tank clogged after seven months of operation due to precipitation of Al-phases. Comparison with published data revealed that even though percentage removals were below our expectations, performance in absolute values was good compared to other systems. The high acidity removal rates are due to the elevated Al concentrations which are easily removed...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{several studies}} have focused on {{terrestrial}} ecosystem response to extreme events. Most of this research has been conducted in natural ecosystems, but few have considered agroecosystems. In this study, we investigated the impact of a manipulated warmer or cooler late winter/early spring on the carbon budget and final harvest of a soybean crop (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). Soil temperature was altered by manipulating soil albedo by covering the soil surface with a layer of inert <b>silica</b> <b>gravel.</b> We tested three treatments – cooling (Co), warming (W), mix (M) – and control (C). An automated system continuously measured soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh), soil temperature profiles, and soil water content across the entire year in each plot. Phenological phases were periodically assessed and final harvest was measured in each plot. Results showed that treatments had only a transient effect on daily Rh rates, which did not result in a total annual carbon budget significantly different from control, even though cooling showed a significant reduction in final harvest. We also observed anticipation in emergence in both W and M treatments and a delay in emergence for Co. Moreover, plant density and growth increased in W and M and decreased in Co. In conclusion, from the results of our experiment we can assert that an increase in the frequency of both heat and cold waves is unlikely to have large effects on the overall annual carbon balance of irrigated croplands...|$|E
50|$|The {{region has}} vast forest {{resources}} and previously used to export logs, lumber, veneer and plywood. Mineral deposits include gold, chromite, coal, iron, lead, and manganese. Among its non-metallic reserves are coal, silica, salt, marble, <b>silica</b> sand, and <b>gravel.</b> Its fishing grounds {{are devoted to}} commercial and municipal fishing. It has also aqua farms for brackish water and freshwater fishes.|$|R
50|$|The {{economy of}} Jiquipilco {{is based on}} {{agriculture}} and stockbreeding. The principal crops are wheat, barley and oats. Because of the difficult local topography, people continue to apply old techniques, and few farmers use mechanized equipment. Livestock is mainly represented by cattle, sheep, pigs and goats. The municipality also has abundant minerals, mostly nonmetallic, such as <b>silica</b> sand and <b>gravel,</b> and stone, obsidian and quartz, which find use in used mostly in construction and road paving.|$|R

Such use includes industrial construction with clays, silica sand, and stone. Silicates are used in Portland cement for mortar and stucco, and mixed with <b>silica</b> sand and <b>gravel</b> to make concrete for walkways, foundations, and roads. They are also used in whiteware ceramics such as porcelain, and in traditional quartz-based soda-lime glass and many other specialty glasses. Silicon compounds such as silicon carbide are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics.|$|R

50|$|Redwater is {{surrounded}} by wide, flat expanses {{of some of the}} best farming soil in Alberta. Some of the major geographical features in the area are the Sturgeon River which travels roughly east-south-east about 15 km south of the town and flows into the North Saskatchewan River. To the east and south-east, there are vast areas of sandy soil known locally as sand hills, some of which support a thriving <b>silica</b> sand and <b>gravel</b> industry. These differing zones support two major types of forest; coniferous, including Jack Pine, Scots Pine, White Spruce, Black Spruce, and some Balsam Fir; broadleaf trees including Birch, Poplar and Aspen.|$|R
5000|$|The {{resulting}} rocks {{had different}} shapes: toppled, overturned, stood-up, pushed around and slanted. Balanced Rock, a fountain formation, {{is a combination}} of coarse sand, <b>gravel,</b> <b>silica</b> and hematite. It is hematite that gives the large balanced rock its red hue. Balanced rock was formed as erosive processes removed softer layers near its base, eventually leaving the precarious-looking formation seen today. The Gateway Rocks Three Graces, and other outcroppings are sedimentary layers that had been pushed up vertically. The largest outcroppings in the park, [...] "North Gateway", [...] "South Gateway", [...] "Gray Rock", and [...] "Sleeping Giant" [...] are composed primarily of Lyons Formation, a stone made of fine sand from ancient sand dunes.|$|R
25|$|Most silicon is used industrially {{without being}} purified, and indeed often with {{comparatively}} little processing from its natural form. Over 90% of the Earth's crust {{is composed of}} silicate minerals, which are compounds of silicon and oxygen, often with metallic ions when negatively charged silicate anions require cations to balance the charge. Many of these have direct commercial uses, such as clays, silica sand and most kinds of building stone. Thus, {{the vast majority of}} uses for silicon are as structural compounds, either as the silicate minerals or silica (crude silicon dioxide). Silicates are used in making Portland cement (made mostly of calcium silicates) which is used in building mortar and modern stucco, but more importantly, combined with <b>silica</b> sand, and <b>gravel</b> (usually containing silicate minerals like granite), to make the concrete that is the basis of most of the very largest industrial building projects of the modern world.|$|R
