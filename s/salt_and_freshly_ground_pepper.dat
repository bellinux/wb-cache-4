40|$|Abstract: Who {{would think}} of cooking a potato in boiling rosin? The origin and {{rationale}} for this interesting cooking behavior is lost in ethno-botanical lore but directions for the practice persisted until recent editions of The Joy of Cooking (Rombauer and Becker 1975). Indeed, the dish can still be obtained at Sweetie Pies Restaurant (Decatur, TX) one day a week. We obtained rosin (Pinerez 1277), produced by Hexion Specialty Chemicals, to duplicate the cooking recipe and to investigate the gustatory effects. The basic recipe involves heating the rosin to 275 0 F and carefully lowering the spud into the pot (see Figure 1). The potato initially sinks in the rosin, but after about 45 minutes, floats to the surface (Rombauer and Becker 1975). The potato is simmered a further 30 minutes, removed from the rosin, and wrapped in heavy brown paper with the ends twisted tightly. The rosin baked potato is cooled for 10 minutes and then slit and served with butter, <b>salt,</b> <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> <b>pepper.</b> The cooking process must be done outside and the skin must not be eaten. The cooking in rosin provides a baked potato with an exceptional texture that is distinctively flaky. Figure 1.

50|$|The use {{of spices}} for both meat and {{vegetable}} dishes is quite extensive and includes many combinations. The combination of whole spices, fried and added {{at the start}} or finish of cooking as a flavoring is special to each dish. Whole black mustard seeds <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> mustard paste form a typical combination. A pungent mustard sauce called kashundi is sauce for snacks or sometimes makes a base ingredient for fish dishes and vegetable dishes.|$|R

Raisins or pineapple chunks may be added, <b>and</b> chilies, <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> black pepper, red pepper flakes, or whole peppercorns complete the mixture. These are then mixed in a solution of vinegar, sugar/syrup, <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> preserves.|$|R
25|$|Fillings in {{pastries}} {{are sometimes}} made of finely ground poppy seeds mixed with butter or milk and sugar. The ground filling {{is used in}} poppy seed rolls and some croissants and may be flavored with lemon or orange zest, rum and vanilla with raisins, heavy cream, cinnamon, and chopped blanched almonds or walnuts added. For sweet baked goods, sometimes instead of sugar a tablespoon of jam, or other sweet binding agent, like syrup is substituted. The poppy seed for fillings are best when they are finely <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> because this will {{make a big difference}} in the pastry filling's texture and taste. Some recipes for Mohnstriezel use poppy seed soaked in water for two hours or boiled in milk. A recipe for Ukrainian poppyseed cake recommends preparing the seeds by immersing in boiling water, straining and soaking in milk overnight.|$|R

40|$|Sound {{high density}} {{cylinders}} of graphite {{have been made}} by cold compacting finely ground artificial graphite at pressure of 60 t. s. i. Cylinders could be made only if the graphite used was 50 percent, finer than 10 microns <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground.</b> Storage of the powder in moist atmospheres or heating of the powder reduced its compacting properties. Uranium and thorium metal powder and uranium and thorium oxide up to 60 weight per cent, equivalent metals {{have been added to the}} graphite and sound cylinders made from the mixtures. The compacts have been heated to high temperatures (up to 2800 °C) to convert the metals or oxides to carbides which rapidly hydrolyse in moist air. Measurements of compressive strength and density changes and investigation of the properties of the compacts on thermal cycling have been made. Compacts made from metal powders are considered satisfactory for use fuel for a High Temperature Gas Cooled reactor system provided their irradiation stability is satisfactory. Recommendations for further work are made...|$|R
50|$|Khaman is a food {{common in}} the Gujarat state of India made from soaked <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> channa dal or channa flour (also called gram flour or besan). Generally eaten as a snack, it is mostly served with sev, fried {{chillies}} and chutney. In some shops it is also served traditionally in a large green leaf. Sometimes it is also garnished with scraped coconut. Khaman, often part of the Gujarati Thali (traditional dish containing various components of a full meal) {{is very similar to}} dhokla, in which the batter is made with a mixture of rice and lentil flour, resulting in a distinct texture and taste. Nonetheless, Khaman, Khaman-Dhokla and Dhokla are often used interchangeably and are synonymous with a steamed snack made with a batter composed of lentil flour or a mixture of lentil and rice flours. Although a Gujarati snack, it has become increasingly popular across India, as well as in other regions with a sizable Gujarati community.|$|R

It was hence concluded that precursor-controlled formation of Fe nanoparticles can be achieved using different solgel technological procedures...|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} using ground corn stalks as the substrate to cultivate marigold (Tagetes erecta L.). Five treatments including peat moss, composted corn stalks <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> corn stalks were tested for their effects on marigold seedling growth. Seedling quality was described by several morphological and physiological parameters. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and GGE biplot analysis. There were significant differences among the treatments for several growth parameters, such as seedling biomass, root biomass, stem diameter, leaf area, seedling vigor, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, root activity, stomatal conductance, and intercellular CO 2 concentration. Treatment T 3, which contained composted ground corn stalks, had the best effect on marigold seedling growth. The results showed that corn stalk was a good substrate for marigold seedlings. GGE biplot demonstrated the substrate effects on marigold seedling quality, and graphically displayed the interrelationships among morphological and physiological parameters. T 3 treatment was the best because four morphological parameters, including seedling biomass, roots biomass, stem diameter and seedling vigor, along with six physiological parameters fall into this sector. These results {{were consistent with the}} results analyzed by Statistical Analysis Software. For morphological parameters, the correlations are complicated. For physiological parameters, they were all positively correlated between each of two parameters...|$|R
5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium <b>and</b> chlorine. Sea <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> mined <b>salt</b> (much {{of which is}} sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of <b>salt,</b> <b>and</b> the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|R

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} natural {{transformation of}} Acinetobacter calcoaceticus BD 413 with homologous chromosomal DNA in a silt loam soil microcosm were investigated. Inducible transformation of declining populations of noncompetent A. calcoaceticus cells was detectable {{for up to}} 6 days when a simple carbon source, <b>salts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> added DNA were used. In two different experimental setups, the residence time in soil of induced cells could be increased to either 11 or 24 h before DNA addition without reduced transformation frequency; 200 -to 1, 000 -fold fewer transformants were observed following the addition of water. These observations suggest that A. calcoaceticus remains transformable for several hours after its activation by nutrients in soil. Increasing the levels of phosphate salts significantly enhanced the numbers of transformants without increasing the recipient counts correspondingly. Variable levels of ammonium or divalent cations (Mg(sup 2 +) and Ca(sup 2 +)) {{did not have a}} similar major influence. Soil moisture content significantly affected the transformation frequency of A. calcoaceticus cells, with a general tendency of higher frequencies in drier soil. A minimal frequency was observed at around 35 % soil moisture. The data indicate that A. calcoaceticus cells in soil which cannot be detectably transformed are easily induced by nutrients to undergo natural transformation with chromosomal DNA. Access to nutrients seems to be critical for the development and maintenance of competence in soil, which is also affected by abiotic factors like moisture level <b>and</b> phosphate <b>salt</b> concentration...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{test whether}} or not dentin desensitizing or sealing methods {{influence}} the bond strength of universal resin cements. Materials and Methods: The bond strength of two universal resin cements (RelyXUnicem, Self-adhesive Prototype Cement) to human dentin was assessed after different dentin surface treatments (test). A conventional resin cement (Panavia 21) served as control. The influence of the following pretreatment methods was tested <b>and</b> compared to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin: dentin desensitizing by means of glutaraldehyde-containing primers (Gluma Desensitizer, Syntac Primer/Adhesive), or dentin sealing by means of bonding agents (Heliobond, ClearfilSE Bond). Additionally, the influence of provisional cement (Freegenol) was analyzed after its application and subsequent mechanical removal. Bond strength after thermocycling was measured in a shear test (n = 10). Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, followed by a post-hoc Tukey test (p < 0. 05). Results: Both test cements exhibited significantly lower bond strength to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin than the control cement. The desensitization methods {{did not affect the}} bond strength of the test cements. Furthermore, the sealing methods significantly increased the bond strength of both test cements as compared to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin. The application and subsequent removal of the provisional cement only had a minor influence on the bond strength of the test cements. The contamination with provisional cement, however, significantly affected the bond strength of the control cement compared to the values achieved on <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin. Conclusion: Desensitization or sealing of dentin have a beneficial effect on the bond strength of universal resin cements. The application of a provisional cement prior to adhesive cementation exhibits no significant influence on the bond strength of the universal resin cements...|$|R
