25|$|Ray S. Jackendoff's model {{deviates}} {{from the}} traditional generative grammar in {{that it does not}} treat syntax as the main generative component from which meaning and phonology is developed unlike Chomsky.

25|$|Each logical system {{comes with}} both a {{syntactic}} component, which among other things determines the notion of provability, and a <b>semantic</b> <b>component,</b> which determines the notion of logical validity. The logically valid formulas of a system are sometimes called the theorems of the system, especially {{in the context of}} first-order logic where Gödel's completeness theorem establishes the equivalence of semantic and syntactic consequence. In other settings, such as linear logic, the syntactic consequence (provability) relation may be used to define the theorems of a system.|$|E

30|$|<b>Semantic</b> <b>components</b> are “separate, combinable, exploitable entities” (ibid.). The {{instantiated}} lexical item {{such as in}} (9) or (10) {{will involve}} some combination of the <b>components.</b> Using <b>semantic</b> <b>components</b> this way enables a clearer sense of where the division between polysemy and homonymy lies. For example, BANK as in river bank does not share any <b>semantic</b> <b>components</b> with BANK in the examples which suggests separate lexemes, despite the similar form. For Hanks, a word gets its meaning from its use and in this sense, meaning is dynamic.|$|R

One-hundred and fifty-two children participated in the present study (68 females; mean age = 4; 10 years/months and 5; 5 years/months at Time 1 and Time 2, respectively). Participants were administered measures to evaluate listening text comprehension (Time 1 and Time 2) and (a) expressive and receptive word knowledge (lower-level <b>semantic</b> <b>components),</b> and (b) inferential skills and the ability to use context (higher-level <b>semantic</b> <b>components)</b> (Time 1). Verbal short-term and working memory were also included as control variables. Data were analyzed using path analysis models. Results showed that both types of <b>semantic</b> <b>components</b> (a) accounted for unique variance in listening text comprehension at Time 2, with lower-level <b>semantic</b> <b>components</b> explaining a larger proportion of variance than higher-level semantic components; (b) were related to later listening text comprehension through direct and indirect relations. Memory resources did not significantly contribute to listening text comprehension. The results are discussed in light of their theoretical relevance and educational/practical implications...|$|R
25|$|The {{transmission}} deficit {{model is}} based on a multi-component theory of memory representation that suggests that semantic and phonological information is stored in memory and retrieved separately. The transmission deficit model posits that TOTs occur when there is activation of the <b>semantic</b> <b>component</b> of the target word memory but this activation does not pass on to the phonological level of the memory of the target word. Thus, TOTs are caused by the deficit in transmission of activation from the semantic memory store to the phonological memory store.|$|E

Thispapergivesaformal approach to make component specification more comprehensive by including <b>component</b> <b>semantic.</b> Fundamentally, the <b>component</b> <b>semantic</b> is expressed via the powerful temporal logic CTL.

40|$|Abstract—It is an {{important}} issue to analyze the behavioral equivalence of <b>semantic</b> <b>components</b> when studying the dynamic replacement and recombination of them for middleware adaptation. However it is difficult to check the equivalence of behaviors rapidly and precisely. In order to improve the precision of judging, and guarantee the normality and stability of system after replacing and recombining components, the paper mainly uses and extends the theories of equivalence analysis based on higher-order typed π calculus. By analyzing the equivalence of <b>semantic</b> <b>components,</b> it can ensure the behavioral consistency of the new component and replaced component, also effectively guarantee the stability and normality of the whole middleware system’s dynamic adaptation.

2500|$|Because {{the vast}} {{majority}} of characters are phono-semantic compounds, combining a <b>semantic</b> <b>component</b> with a phonetic component, each <b>semantic</b> <b>component</b> tended to recur within a particular section of the dictionary. In the 2nd century AD, the Han dynasty scholar Xu Shen organized his etymological dictionary Shuowen Jiezi by selecting 540 recurring graphic elements he called bù (部 , [...] "categories"). Most were common semantic components, but they also included shared graphic elements such as a dot or horizontal stroke. Some were even artificially extracted groups of strokes, termed [...] "glyphs" [...] by Serruys (1984, p.657), which never had an independent existence other than being listed in Shuowen. Each character was listed under only one element, which is then referred to as the radical for that character. For example, characters containing 女 nǚ [...] "female" [...] or 木 mù [...] "tree, wood" [...] are often grouped together in the sections for those radicals.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Shuowen Jiezi has had incalculable {{value to}} {{scholars}} and was traditionally relied upon {{as the most}} important early source on the structure of Chinese characters, many of its analyses and definitions have been eclipsed as vague or inaccurate since the discovery of oracle bone inscriptions in the late 19th century. It therefore can no longer be relied upon as the single, authoritative source for definitions and graphic derivations. Xu Shen lacked access to oracle bone inscriptions from the Shang dynasty and bronzeware inscriptions from the Shang and Western Zhou dynasty, to which scholars now have access; they are often critical for understanding the structures and origins of logographs. For instance, he put lǜ (慮 [...] "be concerned; consider") under the section heading 思 (sī [...] "think") and noted it had a phonetic of hǔ (虍 [...] "tiger"). However, the early bronze graphs for lǜ (慮) have the xīn (心 [...] "heart") <b>semantic</b> <b>component</b> and a lǚ (呂 [...] "a musical pitch") phonetic, also seen in early forms of lǔ (盧 [...] "vessel; hut") and lǔ (虜 [...] "captive").|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} {{instances}} of radicals which play a phonetic {{and not a}} semantic role in characters, such as 臼 [...] jiù [...] "a mortar" [...] in 舅 jiù [...] "maternal uncle" [...] (Shuowen lists this under its <b>semantic</b> <b>component</b> 男 nán, [...] "male", but the 200-odd radicals used in modern dictionaries do not include all the semantic components that are used) and 舊 jiù [...] "owl; old" [...] (listed in the Far East on p.1141 under the header 臼); 虎 hǔ [...] "tiger" [...] in 虖 hū [...] "shout"; 鬼 guǐ (originally [...] "helmet"), now [...] "ghost", [...] in 魁 kúi, [...] "leader"; 鹿 lù [...] "deer" [...] in 麓 lù, foothills; 麻 má [...] "hemp" [...] in 麼 ma, mó [...] "tiny"; 黃 huáng [...] "yellow" [...] in 黌 hóng [...] "a school"; 羽 yǔ [...] "feather" [...] in 翌 yì [...] "next"; 齊 qí in 齎 jī [...] "to present"; 青 qīng in 靖 jìng [...] "peaceful", 靚 jìng [...] "to ornament; quiet"; and 靜 jìng [...] "quiet", and so on. In some cases, arbitrarily chosen radicals coincidentally play a semantic role in the characters listed under them. In general, phonetic components do not determine the exact pronunciation of a character, but only give a clue to a its pronunciation. While some characters take the exact pronunciation of their phonetic component, others take only the initial or final sounds. In fact, some characters' pronunciations may not correspond to the pronunciations of their phonetic parts at all, which is sometimes the case with characters after having undergone simplification.|$|E

40|$|In natural {{language}} human-machine statistical dialog systems, semantic interpretation {{is a key}} task typically performed following semantic parsing, and aims to extract canonical meaning represen-tations of <b>semantic</b> <b>components.</b> In the literature, usually manually built rules are used for this task, even for implicitly mentioned non-named <b>semantic</b> <b>components</b> (like genre of a movie or price range of a restaurant). In this study, we present statistical methods for model-ing interpretation, which can also benefit from semantic features ex-tracted from large in-domain knowledge sources. We extract features from user utterances using a semantic parser and additional semantic features from textual sources (online reviews, synopses, etc.) using a novel tree clustering approach, to represent unstructured information that correspond to implicit <b>semantic</b> <b>components</b> related to targeted slots in the user’s utterances. We evaluate our models on a virtual personal assistance system and demonstrate that our interpreter is effective in {{that it does not}} only improve the utterance interpretation in spoken dialog systems (reducing the interpretation error rate by 36 % relative compared to a language model baseline), but also un-veils hidden semantic units that are otherwise nearly impossible to extract from purely manual lexical features that are typically used in utterance interpretation.
