25|$|The {{complex is}} center {{on a large}} walled {{courtyard}} or atrium, with small stone chapels in the northeastern and northwestern corners. This rather large atrium had a practical as well as symbolic function. The atrium resembled the extensive courtyards (teocallis) of pre-Hispanic temples, and provided space for the 20,000 people that inhabited {{the area in the}} 1560s. With only four friars and a small enclosed church, large <b>services</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> open area, especially on Sundays and holidays, became the only practical solution The atrium possessed a large atrium cross similar to those found in Acolman, Alzacoalco, Tepoztlán and Pátzcuaro, but only the base now remains.|$|E

25|$|Maurice Fitzmaurice {{was born}} on 12 August 1870, the son of John Gerald Fitzmaurice and Florence Augusta Marian Boyrenson. He entered the navy and {{took part in the}} Gambia Campaign in 1894. For his <b>services</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> {{conflict}} he was mentioned in despatches. He then went on to see action in the East African Campaign in 1898, during which he was wounded, and again was mentioned in despatches. Fitzmaurice was active in the Second Boer War between 1899 and 1901, and in the First World War, having become a captain on 30 June 1910. During the latter conflict he captained the battleship , from 5 August 1914 until her loss during the Dardanelles Campaign in 1915. Triumph was torpedoed by the German submarine SM U-21 on 25 May. As she capsized Fitzmaurice was thrown into the water 'as though he had been shot from a gun'. He was picked up by a destroyer after several minutes in the water, apparently with his monocle still firmly in place. He then served as Principal Naval Transport Officer, Dardanelles and Salonika from 1915 until 1916, and then Chief of Staff, Eastern Mediterranean until 1917.|$|E
25|$|The next {{important}} step {{in the history of}} Dutch nationality was the 1848 constitution which stated that (1) a person had to be Dutch to possess the right of nationality and (2) all those with Dutch citizenship have the ability to be employed in public <b>services.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> way, nationality law became part of public law. However, the definition of nationality remained in the code of civil law. This created a problem because not all those defined Dutch by the 1838 civil code were necessarily privileged to enjoy public rights. Because of this, a new nationality law was implemented in 1850 in order to limit the inclusiveness of the nationality law based on the French system. Nevertheless, the new 1850 nationality law did not replace the 1838 civil code and this in turn {{led to the creation of}} a double nationality; political nationality as stated in 1850, and civil nationality of the 1838 civil code. The uncertainties were eliminated in 1892 with the implementation of the Nationality Act which replaced both 1838 and 1850 nationality acts. The new law was based on the German system of jus sanguinis and excluded all previous mention of the principle of jus soli. The new Dutch nationality law survived until the amendments of 1985.|$|E
25|$|At Derna, Robertson {{employed}} his brigade boldly {{in support}} of Lieutenant General Richard O'Connor's attempt {{to cut off the}} retreating Italian Army. Dougherty was ordered to seize Wadi Derna, a ravine 500 metres wide. His lead company reached the wadi and a platoon crossed it, establishing itself on the far side after a fight in which an Australian was killed and nine Italians captured. This small force was counter-attacked by the Italians but the Australians held their ground. Later a group of Italians blundered into the Australian position; 40 were killed and 56 captured. Dougherty now moved to join the attack on Derna, unaware that O'Connor had called it off. His troops soon ran into a large Italian force which was beaten off only with the help of fire from the Vickers machine guns of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers and 25 pounders of the 2/1st Field Regiment. Dougherty had trucks drive to and fro {{to give the impression that}} the position was being reinforced. Fighting went on for another day before the Italians withdrew, having avoided encirclement. However O'Connor was later able to cut off the Italian Army at Beda Fomm. For his <b>services</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> campaign, Dougherty was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E

500|$|A Sunday School building, {{originally}} {{known as}} the Mission Church, {{was built in the}} late 19th century. The Anglican Church of England was holding <b>services</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> building from at least 1891. [...] On 22 September 1897 the foundation stone of a new church, St Saviour's, was laid, next to the Sunday School building. St Saviour's opened 3 February 1898 when it was dedicated by Bishop Montagu Stone-Wigg. Sunday School continued in the old building from 1898 to c.1980. The nearby cemetery had its first burial in 1891. St Saviour's was consecrated in November 1902. The church, as of 2009, holds monthly services attended by 6–7 local parishioners.|$|E
500|$|Mackay and Berryman were {{determined}} that the Battle of Bardia {{would not be a}} repeat of the disastrous landing at Anzac Cove in 1915. [...] Berryman's talent for operational staff work came to the fore. From studies of aerial photographs, he selected a spot for the attack where the terrain was most favourable. His plan provided for the coordination of infantry, armour and artillery. While at times he proved secretive and hard to deal with, during the battle his forceful personality provided a good foil to the sometimes indecisive Mackay. Later that month Berryman planned the equally successful Battle of Tobruk. For his <b>services</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> campaign, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).|$|E
500|$|Downes {{remained}} in the Army throughout the inter-war period. He became a colonel in the Australian Army Medical Corps on 8 January 1920.

He also served {{as head of the}} medical services of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Although the RAAF had become a separate service in 1921, the Minister for Defence decided in 1927 that the Army's Director General of Medical Services [...] should be responsible for the administration of the RAAF's medical <b>services.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> capacity, Downes was answerable to the Air Board.
