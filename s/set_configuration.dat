40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers stimulus-based {{influences on}} consumer decision-making. Context effects, {{referred to as}} <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> effects in this dissertation, have repeatedly been shown to influence choices consumers make. For example, the choice probability of an alternative increases when a similar, but inferior alternative is added to a set originally containing two alternatives. Studies examining <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> effects have generally been conducted using simple choice tasks; that is choice sets with few attributes and alternatives. Some authors have argued that {{increasing the number of}} alternatives and attributes, a more complex task, should reduce the probability of <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> effects. Very few studies have utilized complex tasks to empirically test this assumption. Hence, the extent to which choice set configurations influence choice in complex tasks (i. e. more alternatives and attributes) has not been sufficiently examined. This thesis considers choice <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> effects among consumers presented with complex choice tasks. Five experiments were created to test the influence of set configurations on choice in more complex choice tasks than typically researched. Across these experiments, two set configurations were examined; uniqueness and asymmetric dominance. Uniqueness denotes a <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> in which a single alternative is unique on an important attribute among heterogeneous competitor alternatives. Asymmetric dominance is a <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> in which an alternative that is similar, but inferior, to another alternative is added to the set. Findings from several experiments indicate that these set configurations, uniqueness and asymmetric dominance, can increase choice of a target alternative in complex tasks. A second key finding from this study is that asymmetric dominance can influence choice directly, as just discussed, and at a secondary level, or step. That is, an asymmetric dominance relationship among non-considered alternatives can influence choice among considered alternatives. To my knowledge, this type of secondary level <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> effect has not been observed in the literature. Secondary level <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> effects were moderated by task complexity (simple vs. complex) and product involvement (high vs. low) : secondary level effects were observed in higher involving, complex tasks. I argue that salience of an asymmetric dominance relationship leads to a comparison of considered alternatives to a non-considered, yet good alternative. This comparison can help consumers discriminate among the considered alternatives. Findings lend support to this suggested mechanism for secondary level <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> effects. nhhph...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{arrangement}} of dislocations close to hardness indentations give useful {{information about their}} properties.

Indeed, as shown in [2], in addition to dislocations with Burgers vector inclined to the surface which have moved into the crystal on f 111 g planes which either converge beneath or diverge from the indenter, the plastic zone contains perfect dislocations with Burgers vector parallel to the surface, which have moved primarily parallel to the surface to form rosettes.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} evaluate the performance of an optical switch equipped with both limited-range wavelength conversion and Fiber Delay Lines to resolve contention. We propose an analytical model that allows a general behavior for the packet size distribution while the inter-arrival times {{are assumed to be}} of Phase-Type and can easily be relaxed to be generally distributed if needed. As the set of reachable wavelengths is a major issue in limitedrange wavelength conversion, we first focus on a simple wavelength <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> that allows the comparison of different policies and their effect on the loss rate of the system. In addition, a linear association between the loss rate of the simple and a more complex <b>set</b> <b>configuration</b> is identified. Using this association and the results from the analytical model, we derive an approximation for the more complex case, where the interactions among adjacent wavelengths play an important role. The approximation works well for different parameter instances and is particularly useful for the mid load case, when simulations become computationally prohibitive...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Software {{configurability}} {{has many}} benefits, {{but it also}} makes programs much harder to test, as in the worst case the program must be tested under every possible configuration. One potential remedy to this problem is combinatorial interaction testing (CIT), in which typically the developer selects a strength t and then computes a covering array containing all t-way configuration option combinations. However, in a prior study we showed that several programs have important highstrength interactions (combinations of a subset of configuration options) that CIT is highly unlikely to generate in practice. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called interaction tree discovery (iTree) that aims to identify <b>sets</b> of <b>configurations</b> to test that are smaller than those generated by CIT, while also including important high-strength interactions missed by practical applications of CIT. On each iteration of iTree, we first use low-strength CIT to test the program under a <b>set</b> of <b>configurations,</b> and then apply machine learning techniques to discover new interactions that are potentially responsible for any new coverage seen. By repeating this process, iTree builds up a <b>set</b> of <b>configurations</b> likely to contain key high-strength interactions. We evaluated iTree by comparing the coverage it achieves versus covering arrays and randomly generated <b>configuration</b> <b>sets.</b> Our results strongly suggest that iTree can identify high-coverage <b>sets</b> of <b>configurations</b> more effectively than traditional CIT or random sampling...|$|R
