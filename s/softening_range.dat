The derived mathematical formulations are applied to estimate the reduction disintegration index (RDI+ 6. 3, RDI+ 3. 15, and RDI− 0. 5), reduction index (total reduction index (RIT), manganese reduction index (RIM), and iron reduction index (RIF)), and softening-melting property (start of softening (TS 1), end of softening (TS 2), start of melting (Tm 1), and end of melting (Tm 2)) of manganese ores. The RDI+ 6. 3 and RDI+ 3. 15 are increased with the individual effect of SiO 2 and the interaction effect of iron with silica, while they are decreased as the total iron increased. The high-Fe high-SiO 2 manganese ore showed the highest RIT and RIF. The RIM was almost identical in all manganese ores. The presence of high content of SiO 2 resulted in a narrow <b>softening</b> <b>range</b> (62 – 83 °C), while the high-Fe high-SiO 2 manganese ore exhibited a wider <b>softening</b> <b>range</b> (135 – 140 °C). The melting range was very small in high-Fe low-SiO 2 (3 – 16 °C) and high-Fe high-SiO 2 (6 – 8 °C) manganese ores, while the low-Fe low-SiO 2 manganese ore showed wider melting range (72 – 74 °C). The derived mathematical models are in a good agreement with the experimental results. The calculations are carried out using Matlab program...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of solar cells is metallized by {{printing}} and firing glass containing silver pastes. However, the contact formation is not fully understood so far. There is still {{a lack of understanding}} the role of the glass phase in the complex contact formation scenario because single effects could not been seperatly observed and evaluated up to now. To overcome this, an in-situ method to observe the contact formation via a contact resistance measurement was introduced. A special measuring device was applied to characterize two typical front side pastes, featuring a PbO-containing as well as a PbO-free glass frit during firing. The viscosity of the paste glass showed decisive influence for the etching of the anti-reflection coating (ARC). The ARC was opened immediately after entering the <b>softening</b> <b>range</b> of the respective glass, regardless of large differences in glass chemistry. Furthermore, the viscosity-temperature behaviour of the paste glass determines the intensity of the redox-reaction and related silver precipitation at the interface, which takes part between ARC opening and glass resolidification.

40|$|Distributed damage such as {{cracking}} in heterogeneous {{brittle materials}} may be ap-proximately {{described by a}} strain-softening continuum. To make analytical solu-tions feasible, the continuum {{is assumed to be}} local but localization of softening strain into a region of vanishing volume is precluded by requiring that the softening region, assumed to be in a state of homogeneous strain, must have a certain minimum thickness which is a material property. Exact conditions of stability of an initially uniform strain field against strain localization are obtained for the case of an infinite layer in which the strain localizes into an infinite planar band. First, the problem is solved for small strain. Then a linearized incremental solution is obtained taking into account geometrical nonlinearity of strain. The stability condition is shown to depend on the ratio of the layer thickness to the softening band thickness. It is found that if this ratio is not too large compared to J, the state of homogeneous strain may be stable well into the <b>softening</b> <b>range.</b> Part II of this study applies Eshelby's theorem to determine the conditions of localization into ellipsoidal regions in infinite space, and also solves localization into circular or spherical regions in finite bodies...|$|E

Different micromechanical char–slag interaction patterns may establish, depending on the stickiness of the wall layer and of the impinging char particle. The main goal {{of this study is to}} improve the mechanistic understanding of particle–wall interactions, by using the tool of physical modeling. The idea behind this research campaign is to use molten wax as a surrogate of fuel ash. The wax had rheological/mechanical properties resembling those of a typical coal slag. Experiments have been carried out in a 0. 10 m-ID lab-scale cold entrained-flow reactor, optically accessible, and equipped with a nozzle whence molten wax atomized into a mainstream of air. Reactor lengths in the range 0. 1 – 0. 6 m were investigated, while the wax was atomized at a temperature of 100 – 110 °C. Two interaction regimes were investigated: the “sticky wall–sticky particle” regime was simulated by setting the air mainstream and the wall temperatures at values beyond the wax melting range (160 °C and 140 °C, respectively); the “nonsticky wall–nonsticky particle” regime was simulated by setting both temperatures at 30 °C, i. e. well below the wax <b>softening</b> <b>range.</b> Assessment of the flow and segregation patterns was based on direct visual observation by means of a progressive scan CCD video camera, while the partitioning of the wax droplets into the different phases was characterized by their selective collection at the reactor exhaust. The micromechanics of particle–wall interactions in the “nonsticky–nonsticky” regime was analyzed on the basis of particle impact and of hydrodynamics of gas mainstream and jet flows. Threshold gas velocities for particle detachment were evaluated for the characterization of particle resuspension phenomena...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{thermochemical}} conversion of lignin has received an increasing {{interest in the}} frame of different biorefinery concepts for the production of chemicals or energy. It is needed to better understand the physical and chemical conversion of lignin for feeder and reactor designs. In-situ rheology reveals the viscoelastic behaviour of lignin upon thermal conversion. The softening, re-solidification (char formation), swelling and shrinking behaviours are quantified during pyrolysis in real-time [1]. The in-situ rheology of an alkali lignin (Protobind 1000) was conducted in high torque controlled strain rheometer from 35 °C to 400 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C. min- 1. The swelling, through glass phase transition overlapped with depolymerization, and solidification (crosslinking and "char" formation) are two main phenomena observed during lignin pyrolysis. The onset of temperatures for softening and solidification for this lignin {{has been found to be}} 141 °C and 248 °C respectively. An ex-situ characterization of lignin/char residues obtained at different temperatures after quenching in the rheometer gives a clear understanding of the pathway of lignin degradation. The lignin residues were sampled from the mid-point temperatures of the <b>softening</b> <b>range</b> and solidification range to study the chemical transformations undergoing. Elemental analysis, FTIR and solid state NMR were conducted after quenching on the solid residues (lignin/char). The quenched solid was also extracted by suitable solvent and followed by acetylation and GPC-UV analysis. The combination of 13 C NMR and GPC-UV reveals the depolymerization followed by crosslinking of lignin/char. NMR and FTIR provide the evolution of functional moieties upon temperature. Physical and chemical mechanisms occurring during lignin pyrolysis are accounted for in this study thanks to all these complementary methods. 1.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the environment on the child health is one of priority issues of the present time and it is of great social importance. Increased dental diseases associated with climatic and geographical characteristics of the area are widely discussed in the literature. The leading among them are environmentally determined dental diseases in children associated with geochemical and technogenic pollution of the area where they live. Increasing amounts of hard metal salts is the urgent hygienic problem, due to severity of their multi-element analysis in microsubjects, and negative influence on health of the children population, due to tropism, ability to cumulation, long biological life {{in the body and}} antagonism of heavy metal salts to the number of microelements. Influence of hard metal salts on dental diseases development is undeniable. Particular attention is paid to their influence on caries process and treatment peculiarities. Despite the fact that modern аdhesive dentistry in recent years has made a significant breakthrough in improving adhesive systems, correct choice of adhesive system depending on changes in the structure of hard tissue under geochemical contaminants (like heavy metal salts) is the most important step. It is the decisive factor for adaptation and connection of restoration with the restoration base. We should remember that on the way of adhesive system there is an altered structure preventing from deep penetration of such system and, consequently, leading to violation of restoration tightness. Therefore, early detection of complications by clinical evaluation of quality of the restorations is of great interest. Multi-vector approach to treatment of dental caries in children living in conditions of technogenic pollution by heavy metal salts is extremely urgent and important issue. Significant niche in this approach is given to adhesive preparation methods combined with local fluoridation, using fluoride medication of the new generation. One of them is Hluftored which promotes the formation of microcrystalline СаF 2. Protocol of work with this new generation drug is based on the sequential precoating of enamel with magnesium-fluoride silicate, and then with suspension of high desperasible calcium hydroxide promoting formation of microcrystalline СаF 2, magnesium and copper with the size of ~ 50 Аº, leading to easy penetration of fluoride into pores of <b>softening</b> <b>range.</b> Moreover, microcrystals of CaF 2 are protected by silicic acid gel from outwashing. Therefore, they release fluoride {{for a long period of}} time (over 1 year), which promotes remineralization and prevents complications of dental caries.

Also, we show data of clinical quality assessment conducted for restoration procedures in children of different age groups and territories by using index of USPHS, after 6 and 18 months of carrying out such procedures.

The deformation behavior studies entailed characterization of tensile behaviour in the temperature range 77 K- 873 K for the as received and the fine grained Nb modified variant of AISI 403. The study of elevated tensile behavior in the two steels has been undertaken {{with the purpose of}} characterizing the strain rate – temperature domain of the occurrence of dynamic strain aging (DSA) phenomenon. In both steels, while the temperature range for the manifestations of characteristic anomalies in the tensile curve due to DSA was observed within 523 K – 673 K, the strain rate domain for the fine grain Nb variety was significantly higher as compared with the as-received variety.

Samples with lower constraint showing stable crack growth were further tested at high temperature to obtain the temperature dependence of initiation toughness and propagation toughness. Within the DSA temperature a sharp decline in the fracture properties was observed. A mechanistic interpretation for the manifestations of the various observed phenomena is presented...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe numerically {{investigate}} {{a system of}} particles interacting through a repulsive pair potential of inverse-power form, modified {{in such a way}} that the strength of the repulsion is <b>softened</b> in a <b>range</b> of distances. The solid phases of the system for various levels of softness are identified by computing the zero-temperature phase diagram; then, for each solid phase, the melting line is determined by Monte Carlo simulation. Upon increasing the softness of the potential core, a region appears where melting occurs upon compression at constant temperature (''anomalous'' melting) and a number of low-coordinated crystals become stable at moderate pressures. Next, the structural properties of the system for varying core softness are surveyed in the hypernetted-chain approximation, whose accuracy has been positively tested against numerical simulation. For sufficiently high degrees of softness, the radial distribution function shows the typical interplay between two distinct length scales. In a narrow range of moderate softness, reentrant melting occurs instead with just one length scale, which shows that the existence of two well-definite length scales is not the only mechanism for anomalous melting...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{softening}} {{processes that}} take place after hot deformation in two high Mn steels, one of them microalloyed with 0. 1 %Nb, have been investigated. Double hit torsion tests were carried out {{in order to determine}} the mechanical <b>softening</b> at temperatures <b>ranging</b> from 900 to 1100 ºC. In addition, the applicability of different parameters obtained by means of the Electron Back Scattering Diffraction (EBSD) technique to estimate the recrystallized fraction was investigated. It has been found that the Grain Orientation Spread (GOS) is the parameter that best allows quantifying the recrystallized fraction under the conditions investigated. The correlation between the mechanical softening and the recrystallized fraction measured by EBSD depends on the material and deformation conditions. A good correlation between both values is observed for the base steel at all the temperatures. However, for the Nb microalloyed steel, although at high temperatures a good correlation is also observed, at low temperatures the mechanical softening fraction tends to be larger than the recrystallized fraction denoting that recovery has an important contribution...|$|R

40|$|We {{report an}} {{electric}} field driven destabilization of the insulating state in nominally pure LaMnO 3 single crystal with a moderate field {{which leads to}} a resistive state transition below 300 K. The transition is between the insulating state in LaMnO 3 and a high resistance bad metallic state that has a temperature independent resistivity. The transition occurs at a threshold field (Eth) which shows a steep enhancement on cooling. While at lower temperatures the transition is sharp and involves large change in resistance but it softens on heating and eventually absent above 280 K. When the Mn 4 + content is increased by Sr substitution up to x= 0. 1, the observed transition though observable in certain temperature <b>range,</b> <b>softens</b> considerably. The observation has been explained as bias driven percolation type transition between two coexisting phases, where the majority phase is a charge and orbitally ordered polaronic insulating phase and the minority phase is a bad metallic phase. The mobile fraction f of the bad metallic phase deduced from the experimental data follows an activated kinetics with the activation energy nearly equal to 200 meV and the prefactor fo is a strong function of the field that leads to a rapid enhancement of f on application of field leading to the resistive state transition. We suggest likely scenarios for such co-existing phases in nominally pure LaMnO 3 that can lead to the bias driven percolation type transition. Comment: Accepted in JPC...|$|R
40|$|Summary The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} experimental and numerical dynamic responses of a preloaded vibro-impacting Hertzian contact under sinusoidal excitation. Dynamic response under random excitation is analysed in the second part of this paper. A test rig is built corresponding to a double sphere-plane contact preloaded by the weight of a moving cylinder. Typical response curves are obtained for several input levels. Time traces and spectral contents are explored. Both amplitude and phase of harmonics of the dynamic response are investigated. Linearised resonance frequency and damping ratio are identified from the almost linear behaviour under very small input amplitude. Increasing the external input amplitude, the softening behaviour induced by Hertzian nonlinear stiffness is clearly demonstrated. Resonance peak is confined in a narrow frequency range. Jump discontinuities are identified for both amplitude and phase responses. Forced response spectrum exhibits several harmonics because of nonlinear Hertzian restoring force. Numerical simulations show a very good agreement with experimental results. For higher input amplitude, system exhibits vibro-impacts. Loss of contact non-linearity clearly dominates the dynamic behaviour of the vibroimpacting contact and leads to a wide frequency <b>range</b> <b>softening</b> resonance. Spectral content of the response is dominated by both the first and the second harmonics. Evolution of the experimental downward jump frequency versus input amplitude allows the identification of the nonlinear damping law during intermittent contact. Simulations of the vibroimpacting Hertzian contact are performed using a shooting method and show a very good agreement with experimental results. 1...|$|R
40|$|High-energy gamma-ray {{emission}} from supernova remnants (SNRs) {{has provided}} a unique perspective for studies of Galactic cosmic-ray acceleration. Tycho's SNR is a particularly good target {{because it is a}} young, type Ia SNR that has been well-studied over a wide range of energies and located in a relatively clean environment. Since the detection of gamma-ray emission from Tycho's SNR by VERITAS and Fermi-LAT, there have been several theoretical models proposed to explain its broadband emission and high-energy morphology. We report on an update to the gamma-ray measurements of Tycho's SNR with 147 hr of VERITAS and 84 months of Fermi-LAT observations, which represent about a factor of two increase in exposure over previously published data. About half of the VERITAS data benefited from a camera upgrade, which has made it possible to extend the TeV measurements toward lower energies. The TeV spectral index measured by VERITAS is consistent with previous results, but the expanded energy <b>range</b> <b>softens</b> a straight power-law fit.

The centroid position of the gamma-ray emission is coincident with the center of the remnant, {{as well as with the}} centroid measurement of Fermi-LAT above 1 GeV.

60|$|Mr. Whittier is {{essentially}} a lyric poet, and the fervor of his temperament gives his pieces of that kind a remarkable force and effectiveness. Twenty years ago many of his poems were {{in the nature of}} conciones ad populum, vigorous stump-speeches in verse, appealing as much to the blood as the brain, and none the less convincing for that. By regular gradations ever since his tone has been <b>softening</b> and his <b>range</b> widening. As a poet he stands somewhere between Burns and Cowper, akin to the former in patriotic glow, and to the latter in intensity of religious anxiety verging sometimes on morbidness. His humanity, if it lack the humorous breadth of the one, has all the tenderness of the other. In love of outward nature he yields to neither. His delight in it is not a new sentiment or a literary tradition, but the genuine passion of a man born and bred in the country, who has not merely a visiting acquaintance with the landscape, but stands on terms of lifelong friendship with hill, stream, rock, and tree. In his descriptions he often catches the expression of rural scenery, a very different thing from the mere looks, with the trained eye of familiar intimacy. A somewhat shy and hermitical being we take him to be, and more a student of his own heart than of men. His characters, where he introduces such, are commonly abstractions, with little of the flesh and blood of real life in them, and this from want of experience rather than of sympathy; for many of his poems show him capable of friendship almost womanly in its purity and warmth. One quality which we especially value in him is the intense home-feeling which, without any conscious aim at being American, gives his poetry a flavor of the soil surprisingly refreshing. Without being narrowly provincial, he is the most indigenous of our poets. In these times, especially, his uncalculating love of country has a profound pathos in it. He does not flare the flag in our faces, but one feels the heart of a lover throbbing in his anxious verse.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} determining the resistance of cross-sections of reinforced concrete (RC) columns subjected to the axial force and bending. It takes account {{of the effect of}} concrete <b>softening</b> in plastic <b>range</b> and the mean compressive strength of concrete fcm. Such members are frequently encountered in engineering practice (pillars, bridges, viaducts). The stress-strain relationship for concrete in compression for short term uniaxial loading is assumed according to Eurocode 2 for nonlinear analysis. This stress-strain relation adequately represents the behaviour of the concrete by introducing four parameters. For reinforcing steel characterized by yield stress fyk, linear-elastic model with hardening in plastic range is applied. In the derivation of the resistance of the cross-sections of columns under consideration the following assumptions are introduced:•plane cross-sections remain plane•elasto-plastic stress/strain relationships for concrete and reinforcing steel are used•the tensile strength of concrete is ignored•the ultimate strains for concrete and reinforcing steel are determined a priori. The resistance of the RC cross-section is reached when either ultimate compressive strain in concrete or ultimate tensile strain in steel is reached anywhere in that section. The analytical formulae for the resistance NRm relating to the axial force and MRm relating to the bending moment are derived by integrating the equilibrium equations of the cross-section, taking account of physical and geometrical relationships as well as the condition of the ultimate limit state. On the basis of a combinatorial approach, twelve possible forms of the stress distribution in the section are considered. Using the derived formulae the interaction curves with the values of the normalized, cross-sectional forces nRm = NRm /(b t fcm) and mRm = MRm /(b t 2 fcm) for the rectangular cross-section have been obtained (b, t – dimensions of the rectangle). The obtained formulae describe the cross-section under consideration in the phase of failure. Replacing the mean values fcm and fyk by the corresponding design values fcd and fyd one obtains formulae determining the design values of the normalized cross-sectional forces nR = NR /(b t fcd) and mR = NR /(b t 2 fcd). For presentation of the proposed deformation model numerical calculations have been performed. They are presented in the form of interaction diagrams for rectangular cross-sections. Each curve refers to the corresponding value of the reinforcement ratio. The maximum compressive strain in concrete is calculated at the extreme fibre in the compression zone of the section. The points located on the nRm axis are related to pure compression, while on the mRm axis – to pure bending. The occurrence of the tensile strains in the cross-section leads to the crack formation in the concrete. Moreover, these solutions have been compared with those based on the parabolic-rectangular diagram for concrete under compression and with those obtained experimentally by other authors. In a similar way one may obtain interaction diagrams for ring cross-sections. Based on this analysis conclusions are drawn concerning application possibilities of the proposed approach...|$|R
