40|$|Hybrid III six-year-old (6 YO) child dummy head {{model was}} {{developed}} and validated for frontal impact assessment according to the specifications contained in Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49, Part 572. 122, <b>Subpart</b> <b>N</b> by Livermore Software Technology Corporation (LSTC). This work is aimed at improving biofidelity of the head for frontal impact and also extending its application to lateral impact assessment by modifying the head skin viscoelastic properties and validating the head response using the scaled nine-year-old (9 YO) child cadaver head response recently published in the literature. The modified head model was validated for two drop heights for frontal, right, and left parietal impact locations. Peak resultant acceleration of the modified head model appeared to have good correlation with scaled 9 YO child cadaver head response for frontal impact on dropping from 302 [*]mm height and fair correlation with 12. 3 % difference for 151 [*]mm drop height. Right parietal peak resultant acceleration values correlate well with scaled 9 YO head experimental data for 153 [*]mm drop height, while fair correlation with 16. 4 % difference was noticed for 302 [*]mm drop height. Left parietal, however, shows low biofidelity for the two drop heights as the difference in head acceleration response was within 30 %. The modified head model could therefore be used to estimate injuries in vehicle crash for head parietal impact locations which cannot be measured by the current hybrid III dummy head model...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] The {{safety of}} {{construction}} workers who toil {{in close proximity}} to cranes garnered congressional attention after tower cranes were involved in multiple fatalities at buildings under construction in 2008 (e. g., nine deaths in two incidents in New York City). Additional crane-related fatalities occurred since the House Education and Labor Committee held a hearing on construction worker safety in June 2008, including four employees of a Louisiana-based construction firm who died when the contractor’s mobile crane fell at a Houston refinery. Construction historically has been the most hazardous industry as measured by number of fatalities. With 1, 178 out of 4, 956 on-the-job fatalities in the private sector in 2007, no other industry ranks higher than construction. The majority of construction deaths usually result from falls and transportation accidents (e. g., 38 % and 24 %, respectively, in 2007), according to the classification system of the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries. In contrast, most construction fatalities involving cranes are caused by contact with objects and equipment (e. g., struck by a falling crane). In 2007, contact with objects and equipment accounted for 71 % of crane-related deaths of workers in the construction industry. An analysis of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) files of construction fatalities involving cranes most frequently found violations of the following federal construction safety standard: 29 CFR 1926 <b>Subpart</b> <b>N</b> — Cranes, Derricks, Hoists, Elevators and Escalators. OSHA’s crane and derrick standard has been virtually unchanged since its promulgation in 1971. In a July 2002 notice of intent to create a negotiated rulemaking committee, OSHA acknowledged that industry consensus standards had been updated and crane technology had changed considerably over three decades. The Crane and Derrick Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee voted favorably on an extensive revision to the standard in July 2004 and submitted draft regulatory language to OSHA at that time. After slowly proceeding through the rulemaking process, OSHA submitted a draft proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in June 2008. OMB completed its review on August 28, 2008. Even if OSHA publishes a notice of proposed rule making in early fall, comments of OSHA administrator Foulke at the Education and Labor Committee hearing suggest an updated crane standard is unlikely to become final before the end of 2008. Although most of the 21 states that operate their own safety and health programs for private sector workers have adopted OSHA’s standards, some have developed more stringent regulations for specific hazards in certain industries. For example, many of these states require certification of crane operators: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Utah, and Washington (in 2010). To protect the safety and property of their residents, other jurisdictions have promulgated regulations requiring certification of crane operators as well: Massachusetts, Montana, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Washington, D. C., Miami-Dade county, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, and Omaha...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project is the three phase development of an Early Entrance Coproduction Plant (EECP) which uses petroleum coke to produce at least one product from {{at least two of}} the following three categories: (1) electric power (or heat), (2) fuels, and (3) chemicals using ChevronTexaco's proprietary gasification technology. The objective of Phase I is to determine the feasibility and define the concept for the EECP located at a specific site; develop a Research, Development, and Testing (RD&T) Plan to mitigate technical risks and barriers; and prepare a Preliminary Project Financing Plan. The objective of Phase II is to implement the work as outlined in the Phase I RD&T Plan to enhance the development and commercial acceptance of coproduction technology. The objective of Phase III is to develop an engineering design package and a financing and testing plan for an EECP located at a specific site. The project's intended result is to provide the necessary technical, economic, and environmental information needed by industry to move the EECP forward to detailed design, construction, and operation. The partners in this project are Texaco Energy Systems LLC or TES (a subsidiary of ChevronTexaco), General Electric (GE), Praxair, and Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR) in addition to the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). TES is providing gasification technology and Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) technology developed by Rentech, GE is providing combustion turbine technology, Praxair is providing air separation technology, and KBR is providing engineering. Each of the EECP subsystems was assessed for technical risks and barriers. A plan was developed to mitigate the identified risks (Phase II RD&T Plan, October 2000). Phase II RD&T Task 2. 6 identified as potential technical risks to the EECP the fuel/engine performance and emissions of the F-T diesel fuel products. Hydrotreating the neat F-T diesel product reduces potentially reactive olefins, oxygenates, and acids levels and alleviates corrosion and fuel stability concerns. Future coproduction plants can maximize valuable transportation diesel by hydrocracking the F-T Synthesis wax product to diesel and naphtha. The upgraded neat F-T diesel, hydrotreater F-T diesel, and hydrocracker F-T diesel products would be final blending components in transportation diesel fuel. Phase II RD&T Task 2. 6 successfully carried out fuel lubricity property testing, fuel response to lubricity additives, and hot-start transient emission tests on a neat F-T diesel product, a hydrocracker F-T diesel product, a blend of hydrotreater and hydrocracker F-T diesel products, and a Tier II California Air Resources Board (CARB) -like diesel reference fuel. Only the neat F-T diesel passed lubricity inspection without additive while the remaining three fuel candidates passed with conventional additive treatment. Hot-start transient emission tests were conducted on the four fuels in accordance with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Federal Test Procedure (FTP) specified in Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 86, and <b>Subpart</b> <b>N</b> on a rebuilt 1991 Detroit Diesel Corporation Series 60 heavy-duty diesel engine. Neat F-T diesel fuel reduced oxides of nitrogen (NO{sub x}), total particulate (PM), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and the Soluble Organic Fraction (SOF) by 4. 5 %, 31 %, 50 %, 29 %, and 35 %, respectively, compared to the Tier II CARB-like diesel. The hydrocracker F-T diesel product and a blend of hydrocracker and hydrotreater F-T diesel products also reduced NO{sub x}, PM, HC, CO and SOF by 13 %, 16 % to 17 %, 38 % to 63 %, 17 % to 21 % and 21 % to 39 % compared to the Tier II CARB-like diesel. The fuel/engine performance and emissions of the three F-T diesel fuels exceed the performance of a Tier II CARB-like diesel. Phase II RD&T Task 2. 6 successfully met the lubricity property testing and F-T diesel fuel hot-start transient emissions test objectives. The results of the testing help mitigate potential economic risks on obtaining a premium price for the F-T diesel fuel in the marketplace. The F-T diesel fuel superior properties of low sulfur, low aromatics, and high cetane resulted in lower emissions yields if compared to conventional diesel fuels...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the design}} and {{implementation}} of parallel processing infrastructure is not considered a mainstream IS topic, a working knowledge of its capabilities can have an important influence on improving the design of on-line systems. In order to illustrate some of the advantages and limitations of using parallel processing in information systems two experiments were run to collect multiple node scaling information. Specifically, packet inter-arrival data was collected and analyzed for a message passing interface (MPI) and an HTTP problem that simulated packet movement in an enterprise level LAN test-bed. The parallelization method that we employed broke the problem into <b>N</b> <b>subparts</b> based {{in the number of}} processors used. Inter-processor communication was required whenever a processor needed to interact with another one to help solve the application. That communication was relayed via the MPI protocol using TCP packets with intensities in. 0005 second range. Experimental trials were run on various platforms: from 2 to 12 two processor units for MPI, and 8 and 16 units for HTTP. In the MPI experiment, although the CPU time continued to drop as additional units were added, the elapsed time only dropped to the 4 unit level and then increased thereafter. In the HTTP experiments the two switch/server model provided only a slightly better performance than the one switch/server model...|$|R
