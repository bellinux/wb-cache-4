25|$|Usually, an {{emulsifying}} agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, {{though a}} few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes {{at the cost of}} a perfectly <b>smooth</b> <b>texture.</b> Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them {{to reduce the amount of}} cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the grain}} of Yule Marble that gives an {{appearance}} of <b>smooth</b> <b>texture,</b> a homogeneous look, and a luminous surface that polishes well. These qualities are why it has been chosen {{for a number of}} major national and state landmarks, most notably the Lincoln Memorial. Because of its aesthetic value, architect Henry Bacon successfully urged that it be used to clad the whole exterior of the Memorial, even though it was the most expensive material.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} shape, injera compares to the French crêpe and the Indian dosa as a flatbread cooked {{in a circle}} and used as a base for other foods. The taste and texture, however, are unlike the crêpe and dosa, and more similar to the South Indian appam. The bottom surface of the injera, which touches the heating surface, will have a {{relatively}} <b>smooth</b> <b>texture,</b> while the top will become porous. This porous structure allows the injera to be a good bread to scoop up sauces and dishes.|$|E
25|$|The texture is also heavily {{influenced}} by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus have a <b>smoother</b> <b>texture</b> and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.|$|R

50|$|Conductivity of {{this kind}} of salt bridge depends on a number of factors: the {{concentration}} of the electrolyte solution, the texture of the filter paper and the absorbing ability of the filter paper. Generally, <b>smoother</b> <b>texture</b> and higher absorbency equates to higher conductivity.|$|R
25|$|A {{primary concern}} in Israeli wine {{production}} is maintaining acid levels {{to balance the}} naturally high sugars that the warm climate of the region produces. Vineyards at higher elevations, {{as opposed to the}} lower coastal plains, have more consistently produced wines with the necessary acid balance. Cabernet Sauvignon has shown the greatest aging potential thus far. The <b>smooth</b> <b>texture</b> and ripe tannins of Israeli Merlot has increased that wine's popularity in the market. Chardonnay grown in Israel has shown itself to be highly reflective of terroir and reflective of the particular characteristics of vineyard soils. It is also the primary grape used in Israeli sparkling wine production made according to the methode champenoise.|$|E
500|$|The {{silky shark}} (Carcharhinus falciformis), also known by {{numerous}} {{names such as}} blackspot shark, grey whaler shark, olive shark, ridgeback shark, sickle shark, sickle-shaped shark, and sickle silk shark, is a species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, named for the <b>smooth</b> <b>texture</b> of its skin. It {{is one of the}} most abundant sharks in the pelagic zone, and can be found around the world in tropical waters. Highly mobile and migratory, this shark is most often found over the edge of the continental shelf down to [...] The silky shark has a slender, streamlined body and typically grows to a length of [...] It can be distinguished from other large requiem sharks by its relatively small first dorsal fin with a curving rear margin, its tiny second dorsal fin with a long free rear tip, and its long, sickle-shaped pectoral fins.

500|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} {{affects the}} skin and {{increases the risk of}} tumors in the kidneys and lungs. The condition is characterized by multiple noncancerous dome-shaped tumors of the hair follicles (fibrofolliculomas), particularly on the face, neck, and—more rarely—the upper chest. The fibrofolliculomas are generally described as having an opaque white color or a yellowish tone and have a waxy, <b>smooth</b> <b>texture.</b> The tumors are always found on and around the nose and on and behind the outer ear. Typically, they first appear in a person's 20s or 30s, and are found in more than 80% of people with the syndrome above the age of 40. [...] The tumors become larger and more numerous over time. Tumors differ between individuals: they may appear merged in plaques, look similar to a comedo with a plug of keratin, or include epidermoid cysts. A large number of tumors on the face can be associated with hyperseborrhea (abnormally elevated sebum production). The presence of fibrofolliculomas on a person's face can cause significant psychological distress.|$|E

40|$|In three {{experiments}} {{the perceived}} roughness of visual and of auditory materials was investigated. In Experiment 1, the roughness of frequency-modulated tones was determined using a paired-comparison paradigm. It {{was found that}} using this paradigm similar results in comparison to literature were found. In Experiment 2, the perceived visual roughness of textures drawn from the CUReT database was determined. It was found that participants could systematically judge the roughness of the textures. In Experiment 3 the perceived pleasantness for the textures used in Experiment 2 was determined. It was found that two groups of participants could be distinguished. One group found rough <b>textures</b> unpleasant and <b>smooth</b> <b>textures</b> pleasant. The other group found rough <b>textures</b> pleasant and <b>smooth</b> <b>textures</b> unpleasant. Although for the latter groups the relation between relative roughness and perceived pleasantness was less strong. Industrial Design Engineerin...|$|R

He became interested in these questions, began examining the <b>smooth</b> <b>texture</b> of the walls, the simply constructed bed, the ingenious arrangements by which the labour of bedroom service was practically abolished. And over everything was a curious absence of deliberate ornament, a bare grace of form and colour, that he found very pleasing to the eye. There were several very comfortable chairs, a light table on silent runners carrying several bottles of fluids and glasses, and two plates bearing a clear substance like jelly. Then he noticed there were no books, no newspapers, no writing materials. [...] "The world has changed indeed," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|Aurelia was amazed, for the {{universal}} awe of my Lady {{had made her}} expect a harsh and sever Semiramis style of woman, whereas she certainly saw a majestic beauty, but {{with none of the}} terrors that she had anticipated. The voice was musical and perfectly modulated, the manner more caressing than imperious towards herself, and studiously polite to the house keeper. While orders were being given as to arrangements, Aurelia took in the full details of the person of whom she had heard so much. It seemed incredible that Lady Belamour could have been mother to contemporaries of Betty, for she looked younger than Betty herself. Her symmetry and carriage were admirable, and well shown by the light blue habit laced richly and embroidered with silver. A small round hat with a cluster of white ostrich feathers was placed among the slightly frizzed and powdered masses of mouse-coloured hair, surmounting a long ivory neck, whose graceful turn, the theme of many a sonnet, was not concealed by the masculine collar of the habit. The exquisite oval contour of the cheek, the delicate ear, and Grecian profile were as perfect in moulding as when she had been Sir Jovian's bride, and so were the porcelain blue of the eyes, the pencilled arches of eyebrow, and the curve of the lips, while even her complexion retained its <b>smooth</b> <b>texture,</b> and tints of the lily and rose. Often as Aurelia had heard of her beauty, its splendour dazzled and astonished her, even in this travelling dress.|$|E
