25|$|Aerobic {{desaturation}} is {{the most}} widespread pathway for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. It is utilized in all eukaryotes and some prokaryotes. This pathway utilizes desaturases to synthesize unsaturated fatty acids from full-length <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> substrates. All desaturases require oxygen and ultimately consume NADH even though desaturation is an oxidative process. Desaturases are specific for the double bond they induce in the substrate. In Bacillus subtilis, the desaturase, Δ5-Des, is specific for inducing a cis-double bond at the Δ5 position. Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains one desaturase, Ole1p, which induces the cis-double bond at Δ9.|$|E

However, a recent study showed that even- and odd-chain <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> had opposite associations with type 2 diabetes. Limited studies of Western populations examined the associations of circulating <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> with adipokines, {{an important role in}} glucose metabolism. We examined the associations of <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in serum phospholipids with circulating levels of adipokines among a Japanese population. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 484 Japanese employees (284 men and 200 women) aged 20 - 65 years. The serum <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition in the phospholipid fraction was measured by gas-chromatography. Serum leptin, adiponectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), resistin, and visfatin were measured using a Luminex suspension bead-based multiplexed array. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the association between <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and adipokines, with adjustment for potential confounding variables. Even- and odd-chain <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were differentially associated with adipokines. Higher levels of even-chain <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (14 : 0 myristic, 16 : 0 palmitic, and 18 : 0 stearic acids) were associated with higher levels of resistin (P for trend = 0. 048) and lower levels of adiponectin (P for trend = 0. 003). By contrast, odd-chain <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (15 : 0 pentadecanoic and 17 : 0 heptadecanoic acids) showed inverse associations with leptin and PAI- 1 (P for trend = 0. 048 and 0. 02, respectively). Visfatin was positively associated with both even- and odd-chain <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The results suggest that even- and odd-chain <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are differentially associated with adipokine profile...|$|R

25|$|Catalytic partial {{hydrogenation}} necessarily produces trans-fats, {{because of}} the reaction mechanism. In the first reaction step, one hydrogen is added, with the other, coordinatively unsaturated, carbon being attached to the catalyst. The second step is the addition of hydrogen to the remaining carbon, producing a <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> The first step is reversible, such that the hydrogen is readsorbed on the catalyst and the double bond is re-formed. The intermediate with only one hydrogen added contains no double bond and can freely rotate. Thus, the double bond can re-form as either cis or trans, of which trans is favored, regardless the starting material. Complete hydrogenation also hydrogenates any produced trans fats to give saturated fats.|$|E

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase {{is the point of}} regulation in saturated straight-chain fatty acid synthesis, and is subject to both phosphorylation and allosteric regulation. Regulation by phosphorylation occurs mostly in mammals, while allosteric regulation occurs in most organisms. Allosteric control occurs as feedback inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA and activation by citrate. When there are high levels of palmitoyl-CoA, the final product of <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis, it allosterically inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase to prevent a build-up of fatty acids in cells. Citrate acts to activate acetyl-CoA carboxylase under high levels, because high levels indicate that there is enough acetyl-CoA to feed into the Krebs cycle and produce energy.|$|E
25|$|In chickens, {{a limited}} number of studies have {{investigated}} the specific effect of diet on the fatty acid composition of preen oil in meat chickens. The preen oil of meat chickens is dominated by saturated fatty acids, which make up to 97% of the total fatty acids, with 13 different medium to long chain saturated fatty acids (C8:0 to C22:0) detected. The preen oil contained several odd-chain fatty acids, which suggests they may be derived from lipolysis by the uropygial gland and/or its microbiome. Diet and gender had small but significant effects on levels of specific <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> in the preen oil. The fatty acid composition of the preen oil did not reflect the more diverse fatty acid compositions of the diet or whole blood. Therefore, this clearly indicate that measuring the fatty acid profile of preen oil is not a suitable alternative approach for predicting the fatty acid composition of the blood of meat chickens.|$|E

We compared graded concentrations (0. 1 - 0. 8 mM) of 3 different lipid mixtures: 1) a physiologic <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> mixture (NORM; 40 % <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids),</b> 2) a physiologic mixture high in <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (HSFA; 60 % <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids),</b> and 3) 100 % palmitate (PALM) on insulin signaling and <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> partitioning into triacylglycerol (TAG) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in cultured muscle cells. As expected, PALM readily impaired insulin-stimulated pAktThr 308 /Akt and markedly increased intracellular DAG content. In contrast, the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> mixtures only modestly impaired insulin-stimulated pAktThr 308 M/Akt, and we found no differences between NORM and HSFA. Importantly, NORM and HSFA did not increase DAG content, but instead dose-dependently increased TAG accumulation. Therefore, the robust impairment in insulin signaling found with palmitate exposure was attenuated with physiologic mixtures of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> even with a very high proportion of <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> This may be explained in part by selective partitioning of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> into neutral lipid (i. e., TAG) when muscle cells were exposed to physiologic lipid mixtures...|$|R

2500|$|A {{molecule}} {{of dietary}} fat typically consists of several fatty acids (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a glycerol. They are typically found as triglycerides (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may {{be classified as}} saturated or unsaturated depending on the detailed structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats {{have all of the}} carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms double-bonded, so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a <b>saturated</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids. Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat with trans-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) hydrogenation.
