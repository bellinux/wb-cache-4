40|$|AbstractThe <b>shuttlecock</b> used in {{the game}} of {{badminton}} has astonishing aerodynamic characteristics. The <b>shuttlecock</b> which has an open conical shape is the smallest ballistic coefficient and exhibits the largest in-flight deceleration of any airborne sporting implement. The ballistic coefficient of a body is a measure of its ability to overcome air resistance in flight and is inversely proportional to the deceleration. To evaluate correctly the forces acting the <b>shuttlecock,</b> it is necessary to know the in-flight properties determined from the aerodynamics. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the relationship between aerodynamic properties and flow fields for a <b>shuttlecock</b> with spin rotation at high Reynolds numbers. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to aid in understanding the flow field in the near field of the <b>shuttlecock</b> edge for the wind tunnel test. The effect of <b>shuttlecock</b> deformation on aerodynamic properties was also investigated because it is presumed that aerodynamic forces are affected by the deformation of the <b>shuttlecock</b> skirt. The drag coefficient for the <b>shuttlecock</b> with no gap is significantly smaller than that for the ordinary <b>shuttlecock</b> (with gap). For the ordinary <b>shuttlecock,</b> the air flows through the gap in the <b>shuttlecock</b> skirt, and this flow is related to high aerodynamic drag. That is, the high aerodynamic drag of a badminton <b>shuttlecock</b> is causes by the gap in the <b>shuttlecock</b> skirt...|$|R

40|$|Badminton <b>shuttlecock</b> has a {{complicated}} shape consisting of 16 goose feathers from a waterfowl and a hemispherical cork. Also, the specific air {{resistance of the}} <b>shuttlecock</b> is large and its mass is lightweight, weighing approximately 5. 2 g. When the <b>shuttlecock</b> is hit with a racket or launched by a machine at speeds higher than an initial velocity of 30 m/s, the feather parts of the <b>shuttlecock</b> are typically damaged or broken by large impulse load. In this study, a badminton launching machine using a revolving launch arm has been developed with a new launcher mechanism that can discharge at high speeds to reduce {{the damage to the}} <b>shuttlecock</b> feathers. The launcher mechanism of the <b>shuttlecock</b> was rotated at a high speed from the launch arm, which held the <b>shuttlecock</b> with a grip tool {{at the end of the}} arm rod. The results of the launching experiments using the arm-type badminton machine show that the machine can project the <b>shuttlecock</b> the highest at initial speeds of 36. 0 m/s, with a maximum flight distance of approximately 9. 2 m and the standard deviation of the shot and lateral directions of 0. 30 m and 0. 17 m, respectively. In addition, the dimension and the shape of the grip tool with the <b>shuttlecock</b> were examined to determine their influence on the launching performance of the badminton machine...|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} stroke {{depends on how}} near the <b>shuttlecock</b> is to the net, whether it is above net height, and where an {{opponent}} is currently positioned: players have much better attacking options if they can reach the <b>shuttlecock</b> well above net height, especially if it is also close to the net. In the forecourt, a high <b>shuttlecock</b> will be met with a net kill, hitting it steeply downwards and attempting to win the rally immediately. This {{is why it is}} best to drop the <b>shuttlecock</b> just over the net in this situation. In the midcourt, a high <b>shuttlecock</b> will usually be met with a powerful smash, also hitting downwards and hoping for an outright winner or a weak reply. Athletic jump smashes, where players jump upwards for a steeper smash angle, are a common and spectacular element of elite men's doubles play. In the rearcourt, players strive to hit the <b>shuttlecock</b> while it is still above them, rather than allowing it to drop lower. This overhead hitting allows them to play smashes, clears (hitting the <b>shuttlecock</b> high and {{to the back of the}} opponents' court), and drop shots (hitting the <b>shuttlecock</b> softly so that it falls sharply downwards into the opponents' forecourt). If the <b>shuttlecock</b> has dropped lower, then a smash is impossible and a full-length, high clear is difficult.|$|R
50|$|Slicing {{and using}} a {{shortened}} hitting action are the two main technical devices that facilitate deception. Slicing involves hitting the <b>shuttlecock</b> with an angled racquet face, causing it to travel {{in a different direction}} than suggested by the body or arm movement. Slicing also causes the <b>shuttlecock</b> to travel more slowly than the arm movement suggests. For example, a good crosscourt sliced dropshot will use a hitting action that suggests a straight clear or smash, deceiving the opponent about both the power and direction of the <b>shuttlecock.</b> A more sophisticated slicing action involves brushing the strings around the <b>shuttlecock</b> during the hit, {{in order to make the}} <b>shuttlecock</b> spin. This can be used to improve the shuttle's trajectory, by making it dip more rapidly as it passes the net; for example, a sliced low serve can travel slightly faster than a normal low serve, yet land on the same spot. Spinning the <b>shuttlecock</b> is also used to create spinning netshots (also called tumbling netshots), in which the <b>shuttlecock</b> turns over itself several times (tumbles) before stabilizing; sometimes the <b>shuttlecock</b> remains inverted instead of tumbling. The main advantage of a spinning netshot is that the opponent will be unwilling to address the <b>shuttlecock</b> until it has stopped tumbling, since hitting the feathers will result in an unpredictable stroke. Spinning netshots are especially important for high level singles players.|$|R

60|$|Only {{one cause}} for delay seemed {{tolerable}} to the Paying Teller. This {{was to stop}} at every post-office. We had received but one mail while in camp, which had been brought in a sail-boat from an office twenty miles away.

Some of the post-offices where we stopped were lonely little buildings with no other habitation near. These we usually found shut up, being opened only on mail-days, and in such cases nothing could be done but to slip a protesting postal into the little slit in the wall apparently intended for letters. Whether these postals were eaten by rats or read by the P.M.'s, we never discovered. Wherever an office was found open, we left behind us an irate postmaster breathing all sorts of contemplated vengeance upon the disturbers of his peace. We heard of letters that had been sent north and sent south, but there never were any at the particular place where we happened to be, and I suppose that the accumulated mail of the Paying Teller may for several years drop gradually upon him through the meshes of the Dead-Letter Office.|$|E

40|$|<b>Shuttlecock</b> used in {{badminton}} {{match is}} light in mass, which is {{strongly influenced by}} air resistance. The highest launching velocity of the <b>shuttlecock</b> exceeds 300 km/hr for professional badminton players. In this study, the improving performance of the badminton machine with the two rollers developed by the author is examined. Finite element models of a feather <b>shuttlecock</b> and the badminton machine with two rollers are made, and the projection simulations proceed with the moving behavior and contact stress of the <b>shuttlecock.</b> The coefficient of friction is examined from the surfaces {{in contact with the}} <b>shuttlecock</b> and the roller in the analysis. From the results of analysis, it is found that the roller with a large diameter attains the higher speed of the <b>shuttlecock</b> than the small rollers for every project. The taper angles of the roller edge and the insert height of the <b>shuttlecock</b> relative to the roller surface are optimized for attaining the maximum shuttle speed by the projection simulation and the response surface approach. In the results of the optimization, the performance of the machine has been improved as the shuttle speeds increased by about 7 % and the stress causing the shuttle deterioration decreased. Additionally, the validity of the optimum condition has been confirmed by the corresponding shot experiments using the two-roller type badminton machine. © 2011 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|R
60|$|The {{peculiar}} {{character of}} these streets, and the close resemblance each one bears to its neighbour, {{by no means}} tends to decrease the bewilderment in which the unexperienced wayfarer through ‘the Dials’ finds himself involved. He traverses streets of dirty, straggling houses, with now and then an unexpected court composed of buildings as ill-proportioned and deformed as the half-naked children that wallow in the kennels. Here and there, a little dark chandler’s shop, with a cracked bell hung up behind the door to announce the entrance of a customer, or betray the presence of some young gentleman in whom a passion for shop tills has developed itself at an early age: others, as if for support, against some handsome lofty building, which usurps {{the place of a}} low dingy public-house; long rows of broken and patched windows expose plants that may have flourished when ‘the Dials’ were built, in vessels as dirty as ‘the Dials’ themselves; and shops for the purchase of rags, bones, old iron, and kitchen-stuff, vie in cleanliness with the bird-fanciers and rabbit-dealers, which one might fancy so many arks, but for the irresistible conviction that no bird in its proper senses, who was permitted to leave one of them, would ever come back again. Brokers’ shops, which would seem to have been established by humane individuals, as refuges for destitute bugs, interspersed with announcements of day-schools, penny theatres, petition-writers, mangles, and music for balls or routs, complete the ‘still life’ of the subject; and dirty men, filthy women, squalid children, fluttering <b>shuttlecocks,</b> noisy battledores, reeking pipes, bad fruit, more than doubtful oysters, attenuated cats, depressed dogs, and anatomical fowls, are its cheerful accompaniments.|$|E

60|$|When {{a man is}} in {{a violent}} hurry to get on, and has a {{specific}} object in view, the attainment of which depends on the completion of his journey, the difficulties which interpose themselves in his way appear not only to be innumerable, but to have been called into existence especially for the occasion. The remark {{is by no means}} a new one, and Mr. Gabriel Parsons had practical and painful experience of its justice in the course of his drive. There are three classes of animated objects which prevent your driving with any degree of comfort or celerity through streets which are but little frequented—they are pigs, children, and old women. On the occasion we are describing, the pigs were luxuriating on cabbage-stalks, and the <b>shuttlecocks</b> fluttered from the little deal battledores, and the children played in the road; and women, with a basket in one hand, and the street-door key in the other, would cross just before the horse’s head, until Mr. Gabriel Parsons was perfectly savage with vexation, and quite hoarse with hoi-ing and imprecating. Then, when he got into Fleet-street, there was ‘a stoppage,’ in which people in vehicles have the satisfaction of remaining stationary for half an hour, and envying the slowest pedestrians; and where policemen rush about, and seize hold of horses’ bridles, and back them into shop-windows, by way of clearing the road and preventing confusion. At length Mr. Gabriel Parsons turned into Chancery-lane, and having inquired for, and been directed to Cursitor-street (for it was a locality of which he was quite ignorant), he soon found himself opposite the house of Mr. Solomon Jacobs. Confiding his horse and gig to the care of one of the fourteen boys who had followed him from the other side of Blackfriars-bridge on the chance of his requiring their services, Mr. Gabriel Parsons crossed the road and knocked at an inner door, the upper part of which was of glass, grated like the windows of this inviting mansion with iron bars—painted white to look comfortable.|$|E

6000|$|One of the illustrious {{patrons of}} the Museum Theatre, and {{occupant}} of the great proscenium-box, was a gentleman whose name has been mentioned in a previous history; that refined patron of the arts, and enlightened lover of music and the drama, the Most Noble the Marquis of Steyne. His lordship's avocations as a statesman prevented him from attending the playhouse very often, or coming very early. But he occasionally appeared at the theatre {{in time for the}} ballet, and was always received with the greatest respect by the Manager, from whom he sometimes condescended to receive a visit in his box. It communicated with the stage, and when anything occurred there which particularly pleased him, when a new face made its appearance among the coryphees, or a fair dancer executed a pas with especial grace or agility, Mr. Wenham, Mr. Wagg, or some other aide-de-camp of the noble Marquis, would be commissioned to go behind the scenes, and express the great man's approbation, or make the inquiries which were prompted by his lordship's curiosity, or his interest in the dramatic art. He could not be seen by the audience, for Lord Steyne sate modestly behind a curtain, and looked only towards the stage--but you could know he was in the house, by the glances which all the corps-de-ballet, and all the principal dancers, cast towards his box. I have seen many scores of pairs of eyes (as in the Palm Dance in the ballet of Cook at Otaheite, where no less than a hundred-and-twenty lovely female savages in palm leaves and feather aprons, were made to dance round Floridor as Captain Cook) ogling that box as they performed before it, and have often wondered to remark the presence of mind of Mademoiselle Sauterelle, or Mademoiselle de Bondi (known as la petite Caoutchoue), who, when actually up in the air quivering like so many <b>shuttlecocks,</b> always kept their lovely eyes winking at that box in which the great Steyne sate. Now and then you would hear a harsh voice from behind the curtain cry, [...] "Brava, Brava," [...] or a pair of white gloves wave from it, and begin to applaud. Bondi, or Sauterelle, when they came down to earth, curtsied and smiled, especially to those hands, before they walked up the stage again, panting and happy.|$|E
60|$|That {{anything}} born of an egg {{and invested}} with wings, should {{have got to}} the pass that it hops contentedly down a ladder into a cellar, and calls THAT going home, is a circumstance so amazing as to leave one nothing more in this connexion to wonder at. Otherwise I might wonder at the completeness with which these fowls have become separated from all the birds of the air--have taken to grovelling in bricks and mortar and mud--have forgotten all about live trees, and make roosting-places of shop-boards, barrows, oyster-tubs, bulk-heads, and door-scrapers. I wonder at nothing concerning them, and take them as they are. I accept as products of Nature and things of course, a reduced Bantam family of my acquaintance in the Hackney-road, who are incessantly at the pawnbroker's. I cannot say that they enjoy themselves, for they are of a melancholy temperament; but what enjoyment they are capable of, they derive from crowding together in the pawnbroker's side-entry. Here, they are always {{to be found in}} a feeble flutter, as if they were newly come down in the world, and were afraid of being identified. I know a low fellow, originally of a good family from Dorking, who takes his whole establishment of wives, in single file, in {{at the door of the}} jug Department of a disorderly tavern near the Haymarket, manoeuvres them among the company's legs, emerges with them at the Bottle Entrance, and so passes his life: seldom, in the season, going to bed before two in the morning. Over Waterloo-bridge, there is a shabby old speckled couple (they belong to the wooden French-bedstead, washing-stand, and towel- horse-making trade), who are always trying to get in at the door of a chapel. Whether the old lady, under a delusion reminding one of Mrs. Southcott, has an idea of entrusting an egg to that particular denomination, or merely understands that she has no business in the building and is consequently frantic to enter it, I cannot determine; but she is constantly endeavouring to undermine the principal door: while her partner, who is infirm upon his legs, walks up and down, encouraging her and defying the Universe. But, the family I have been best acquainted with, since the removal from this trying sphere of a Chinese circle at Brentford, reside in the densest part of Bethnal-green. Their abstraction from the objects among which they live, or rather their conviction that those objects have all come into existence in express subservience to fowls, has so enchanted me, that I have made them the subject of many journeys at divers hours. After careful observation of the two lords and the ten ladies of whom this family consists, I have come to the conclusion that their opinions are represented by the leading lord and leading lady: the latter, as I judge, an aged personage, afflicted with a paucity of feather and visibility of quill, that gives her the appearance of a bundle of office pens. When a railway goods van that would crush an elephant comes round the corner, tearing over these fowls, they emerge unharmed from under the horses, perfectly satisfied that the whole rush was a passing property in the air, which may have left something to eat behind it. They look upon old shoes, wrecks of kettles and saucepans, and fragments of bonnets, as a kind of meteoric discharge, for fowls to peck at. Peg-tops and hoops they account, I think, as a sort of hail; <b>shuttlecocks,</b> as rain, or dew. Gaslight comes quite as natural to them as any other light; and I have more than a suspicion that, in the minds of the two lords, the early public-house at the corner has superseded the sun. I have established it as a certain fact, that they always begin to crow when the public-house shutters begin to be taken down, and that they salute the potboy, the instant he appears to perform that duty, as if he were Phoebus in person.|$|E
50|$|The {{feathers}} are brittle; <b>shuttlecocks</b> break {{easily and}} often {{need to be}} replaced several times during a game. For this reason, synthetic <b>shuttlecocks</b> have been developed that replace the feathers with a plastic skirt. Players often refer to synthetic <b>shuttlecocks</b> as plastics and feathered <b>shuttlecocks</b> as feathers.|$|E
5000|$|When {{playing a}} netshot, slicing {{underneath}} the <b>shuttlecock</b> may {{cause it to}} turn over itself (tumble) several times as it passes the net. This is called a spinning netshot or tumbling netshot. The opponent will be unwilling to address the <b>shuttlecock</b> until it has corrected its orientation.|$|R
50|$|This Leg's Detour was {{a choice}} between Featherball and China Cup. In Featherball, the team played jianzi (a game similar to hackeysack that uses a <b>shuttlecock)</b> with two local players. Once the {{teammates}} successfully volleyed the <b>shuttlecock</b> a combined 10 times (volleys between the local players were not counted), they received their next clue. If at any time the <b>shuttlecock</b> fell to the ground, teams would have to start over. In China Cup, each team member received a traditional massage involving cupping therapy, and would receive their next clue after the massage was completed.|$|R
50|$|Statistics {{such as the}} smash speed, above, prompt {{badminton}} enthusiasts to {{make other}} comparisons that are more contentious. For example, it is often claimed that badminton is the fastest racquet sport. Although badminton holds {{the record for the}} fastest initial speed of a racquet sports projectile, the <b>shuttlecock</b> decelerates substantially faster than other projectiles such as tennis balls. In turn, this qualification must be qualified by consideration of the distance over which the <b>shuttlecock</b> travels: a smashed <b>shuttlecock</b> travels a shorter distance than a tennis ball during a serve.|$|R
