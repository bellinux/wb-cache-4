50|$|<b>Systematic</b> <b>risk</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in portfolio allocation. Risk which cannot be eliminated through diversification commands returns in excess of the risk-free rate (while idiosyncratic risk does not command such returns since it can be diversified). Over the long run, a well-diversified portfolio provides returns which correspond with its exposure to systematic risk; investors face a trade-off between returns and <b>systematic</b> <b>risk.</b> Therefore, an investor's desired returns correspond with their desired exposure to <b>systematic</b> <b>risk</b> and corresponding asset selection. Investors can only reduce a portfolio's exposure to <b>systematic</b> <b>risk</b> by sacrificing returns.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{involved}} an empirical {{investigation of the}} predictability of Australian industrial stock returns using a dynamic state-space framework. The <b>systematic</b> <b>risks</b> of industrial portfolios were examined in a stochastic market- model. The <b>systematic</b> <b>risks</b> of industry portfolios {{are found to be}} stochastic processes. Most of the industry groups have time-varying <b>systematic</b> <b>risks</b> that are mean-reverting to their stable or moving long-term mean. However, the investment and financial services, alcohol and tobacco, gold, insurance and media industry groups have rather random <b>systematic</b> <b>risks.</b> The time-varying market model provides a better explanation of the portfolio returns than the single-index model since it captures the stochastic properties of market risk. Further, a Bayesian dynamic-forecasting model was employed to examine the explanatory power of a set of economic and financial variables. The unanticipated components of the term-structure variable, the interest-rate variable and the aggregate-dividend-yield variable were shown to be significant in explaining the industry portfolio excess returns. The comparison between multivariate analysis and univariate analysis strongly indicates that the correlations within industries are critical in the investigation of the predictability of returns. In the out-of-sample analysis, a maximally predicted portfolio (MPP) was constructed based on the updated economic and financial information; however, the predictability of the MPP did not exceed that of a naive forecast. Furthermore, the market timing ability associated with the predictability of the MPP was insignificant. The industry-group-rotation strategy is able to enhance the industry portfolio performance, but the predictability only contributes a small proportion of the profits. The results indicate that the industry returns contain predictive components; however, investors are less likely to exploit the existing predictability to gain excess profit. The level of predictability discovered here does not contradict market-efficiency theory...|$|R

When portfolios are formed on estimates of both <b>systematic</b> mispricing <b>risk</b> and the liquidity betas of Amihud (2002), Pastor-Stambaugh (2003) or Liu (2006) there is evidence of a significant risk-adjusted return spread associated with <b>systematic</b> mispricing <b>risk,</b> but no longer any evidence of a <b>systematic</b> liquidity <b>risk</b> premium.

Cichello (2005) empirically shows that the negative association between pay-performance sensitivity and a firm’s risk is diminished once controlled for firm size. A recent study from Ju and Wan (2012) suggests that pay-performance sensitivity and a firm’s risk bears a non-monotonic relationship.
