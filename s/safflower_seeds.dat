Backyard birders attract it using feeders containing seeds, particularly sunflower seeds and <b>safflower</b> <b>seeds.</b> Although some controversy surrounds bird feeding, an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species. It is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List, with an estimated global range of 5,800,000 km2 and a global population of some 100 million. Populations appear to remain stable and not threatened to reach the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations. It was once prized as a pet due to its bright color and distinctive song. In the United States, this species receives special legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, which also banned their sale as cage birds.

The experiment was designed with 350 commercial one-day-old male broiler chickens using completely randomized design with 5 dietary treatments and 5 replications. Prior to the study, a commercial starter diet was fed to broiler chickens for 3 weeks. On day 21 of age 14 birds were allocated to each experimental unit (1. 5 × 1. 5 m floor pen). Experimental diets for the five treatments were prepared to be iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous. Broiler chickens were provided with feed and water ad libitum. Data on weight gain, feed consumption and feed efficiency were recorded weekly basis. At the end of the experiment (42 days of age) one bird from each replication was selected randomly, blood sample was collected and the birds were slaughtered to determine carcass parameters. Inclusion of full fat <b>safflower</b> <b>seed</b> in experimental diets, did not significantly affect weight gain, feed consumption and feed efficiency.

Especially {{the role of}} bacteria, archaea, fungi and protozoa in mediating the lipid effects is unclear. In the present in vitro study, archaea, fungi and protozoa were selectively inhibited by specific agents. This was fully or almost fully successful for fungi and protozoa as well as archaeal activity {{as determined by the}} methyl-coenzyme M reductase alpha subunit gene. Five different microbial treatments were generated: rumen fluid being intact (I), without archaea (-A), without fungi (-F), without protozoa (-P) and with bacteria only (-AFP). A forage-concentrate diet given alone or supplemented with crushed full-fat oilseeds of either safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) or poppy (Papaver somniferum) or camelina (Camelina sativa) at 70 g oil kg- 1 diet dry matter was incubated. This added up to 20 treatments with six incubation runs per treatment. All oilseeds suppressed methane emission compared to the non-supplemented control. Compared to the non-supplemented control, -F decreased organic matter (OM) degradation, and short-chain fatty acid concentration was greater with camelina and <b>safflower</b> <b>seeds.</b> Methane suppression per OM digested in -F was greater with camelina seeds (- 12 vs. - 7 % with I, P = 0. 06), but smaller with poppy seeds (- 4 vs. - 8 % with I, P = 0. 03), and not affected with <b>safflower</b> <b>seeds.</b> With -P, camelina seeds decreased the acetate-to-propionate ratio and enhanced the methane suppression per gram dry matter (18 vs. 10 % with I, P = 0. 08). Hydrogen recovery was improved with -P in any oilseeds compared to non-supplemented control. No methane emission was detected with the -A and -AFP treatments. In conclusion, concerning methanogenesis, camelina seeds seem to exert effects only on archaea and bacteria. By contrast, with safflower and poppy seeds methane was obviously reduced mainly through the interaction with protozoa or archaea associated with protozoa. This demonstrated that the microbial groups differ in their contribution to the methane suppressing effect dependent on the source of lipid.

The effects of both catalyst and the temperature of catalytic bed on the tar decomposition and the overall gaseous product yield were investigated comparatively. It was found that ceria modified iron oxide catalysts had higher reactivity than that of the individual Fe 2 O 3 and CeO 2 for the catalytic tar decomposition in <b>safflower</b> <b>seed</b> cake steam gasification. The CeO 2 -Fe 2 O 3 catalyst with 50 wt. % of Fe 2 O 3 exhibited the excellent performance for tar conversion at 700 °C. A comparison of tar decomposition from thermal run and catalytic run showed that in thermal run tar decomposition was progressed via steam reforming only. However, in the presence of catalyst, tar decomposition occurred via both steam reforming and water gas shift reaction. As a conclusion, ceria promoted iron catalysts were found to be active for both hydrogen production and tar decomposition in steam gasification of lignocellulosic biomass.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of 10 diverse safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) accessions {{from across the}} world held in the Australian Temperate Field Crops Collection showed considerable variation in phenology, agronomic traits and plant architecture. Time to flowering ranged from 73 to 88 days after sowing, plant height post flowering from 45 to 100 cm and branching angle from appressed to spreading. The accessions also differed in degree of leaf spininess and susceptibility to leaf rust. Knowledge of the diversity present in existing germplasm collections {{and the availability of}} viable seed stocks can assist breeding programs, especially given that <b>safflower</b> <b>seed</b> imported into Australia must first be regenerated in quarantine which takes time and money...|$|R
