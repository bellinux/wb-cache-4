Early the next year, the route of US2 was realigned to run into St. Ignace; after the change, US2 and US31 ran concurrently. Later that year, a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> were {{straightened}} out south of Ludington and the routes of US31 and a US31A between Saugatuck and Holland were switched, and US31 was realigned to bypass downtown Ludington.|$|E

The highway followed Ten Curves Road east and then north out town. The trunkline turned back due east and crosses the Fox River before a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> that shifted the highway along the Schoolcraft–Luce county line to pass north of Big Manistique Lake. Ten Curves Road passes between the Big and North Manistee lakes as it enters the community of Helmer in Luce County. There, M-98 intersected M-135, and the two ran concurrently north along Manistique Lakes Road. M-98/M-135 turned due east to intersect M-28 southwest of McMillan near East Lake.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{perceived}} discrepancies between early and more recent determinations, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recently revised its standard curves {{as defined in}} ISO 226, {{in response to the}} recommendations of a study coordinated by the Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Japan. The study produced new curves by combining the results of several studies, by researchers in Japan, Germany, Denmark, UK, and USA. (Japan was the greatest contributor with about 40% of the data.) This has resulted in the recent acceptance of a new <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> standardized as ISO 226:2003. The report comments on the surprisingly large differences, {{and the fact that the}} original Fletcher–Munson contours are in better agreement with recent results than the Robinson-Dadson, which appear to differ by as much as 10–15dB especially in the low-frequency region, for reasons that are not explained. Fortuitously, the 40-phon Fletcher–Munson curve is particularly close to the modern ISO 226:2003 standard.|$|E
40|$|With modern technology, massive {{data can}} easily be {{collected}} in a form <b>of</b> multiple <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves.</b> New statistical challenge includes testing whether there is any statistically signi cant di erence among these <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves.</b> In this paper, we propose some new tests for comparing two groups <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> based on the adaptive Neyman test and the wavelet thresholding techniques introduced in Fan (1996). We demonstrate that these tests inherit the properties outlined in Fan (1996) and they are simple and powerful for detecting di erences between two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves.</b> We then further generalize the idea to compare multiple <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves,</b> resulting in an adaptive high-dimensional analysis of variance, called HANOVA. These newly developed techniques are illustrated by using a dataset on pizza commercial where observations are curves and an analysis of cornea topography in ophthalmology where images of individuals are observed.

By the next year, the northern end of the highway near Posen was moved to eliminate several zig-zagging segments of roadway from the routing; M-65 ran due north to terminate at US23 after the change. In the middle of 1953, the section of M-65/M-72 in Alcona County was straightened and paved. The MSHD realigned M-65 from a series of zig-zagging roads to a single <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> along the Alcona–Alpena county line in late 1961. At the time this project was completed, all of M-65 was paved.|$|E

She {{almost always}} unites two {{infinite}} ones, so as to form a reversed curve for each main line, and then modulates each of them into myriads of minor ones. In a single elm leaf, such as Fig. 4, Plate +8+, she uses three such--one for the stalk, and {{one for each of}} the sides,--to regulate their general flow; dividing afterwards each of their broad lateral lines into some twenty less curves by the jags of the leaf, and then again into minor waves. Thus, in any complicated group of leaves whatever, the infinite curves are themselves almost countless. In a single extremity of a magnolia spray, the uppermost figure in Plate +42+, including only sixteen leaves, each leaf having some three to five distinct curves along its edge, the lines for separate study, including those of the stems, would be between sixty and eighty. In a single spring-shoot of laburnum, the lower figure in the same plate, I leave the reader to count them for himself; all these, observe, being seen at one view only, and every change of position bringing into sight another equally numerous <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves.</b> For instance, in Plate +43+ is a group of four withered leaves, in four positions, giving, each, a beautiful and well composed group of curves, variable gradually into the next group as the branch is turned.|$|E

40|$|White matter fiber {{bundles of}} the human brain form a spatial pattern defined by the {{anatomical}} and functional architecture. Human brain atlases provide names for individual tracts and document that these patterns are comparable across subjects. Tractography applied to the tensor field in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) results in <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> streamlines which can be associated with major fiber tracts. Comparison of fiber tract properties across subjects requires comparison at corresponding anatomical locations. As an alternative to linear and nonlinear registration of DTI images and voxel-based analysis, we propose a novel methodology that models the shape of white matter tracts. A clustering uses similarity <b>of</b> adjacent <b>curves</b> and an iterative processing scheme to group <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> to bundles and to reject outliers. Unlike previous work which models fiber tracts as <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> centered around a spine, we extend the notion of bundling towards a more general representation of manifolds. We describe tracts, represented as <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> <b>of</b> similar shape, by a shape prototype swept along a space trajectory. This approach can naturally describe white matter structures observed either as bundles dispersing towards the cortex or tracts defined as dense patterns of parallel fibers forming manifolds. Curves are parameterized by arc-length and represented by intrinsic local shape properties (curvature and torsion). Feasibility is demonstrated by modeling the left and right cortico-spinal tracts and a part of the transversal callosal tract. 1...|$|R

50|$|In {{mathematics}} and computer vision, the ridges (or the ridge set) of a smooth function of two variables are a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> whose points are, {{in one or}} more ways to be made precise below, local maxima of the function in at least one dimension. This notion captures the intuition of geographical ridges. For a function of N variables, its ridges are a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> whose points are local maxima in N − 1 dimensions. In this respect, the notion of ridge points extends the concept of a local maximum. Correspondingly, the notion of valleys for a function can be defined by replacing the condition of a local maximum with the condition of a local minimum. The union of ridge sets and valley sets, together with a related set of points called the connector set form a connected <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> that partition, intersect, or meet at the critical points of the function.

Third, we apply these ideas to construct <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> non-periodic irreducible automorphisms of surfaces following [14, 35, 43], so that the involved proofs do not use any differential or algebraic tools, but, accordingly, substitution and D 0 L-system theory of [11, 12, 31, 32, 37]—mainly the decidability for a D 0 L-language [12] to be strongly repetitive or not.
