25|$|Dima Bolmatov, V. V. Brazhkin and K. Trachenko {{discovered}} that specific heat shows a crossover between two different dynamic regimes of the low-temperature rigid-liquid and high temperature non-rigid gas-like fluid. Rigid liquids are rigid like a solid on short time scales, but flow like a liquid on long time scales; while a supercritical gas-like fluid has the dynamic motions {{of a gas}} but is able to dissolve materials, like a liquid. The crossover challenges the currently held belief that no difference can be made between a gas and a liquid above the critical point and that the <b>supercritical</b> <b>state</b> is homogeneous in terms of physical properties. Bolmatov and colleagues formulated a theory of system thermodynamics and heat capacity above the crossover. In that theory, energy and heat capacity are governed by the minimal length of the longitudinal mode in the system only, and do not depend on system-specific structure and interactions. Bolmatov and colleagues predicted relationship between supercritical exponents of heat capacity and viscosity and derived a power law for the <b>supercritical</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

Densities have been measured with a computer-controlled high-temperature, high-pressure vibrating tube densimeter system in the sub- and <b>supercritical</b> <b>states</b> at temperatures from 273 to 523 K and pressures up to 35 MPa (363 overall data points), for which densities between 194 and 1, 485 kg/m 3 were covered. The uncertainty in density measurement was estimated to be no greater than 0.1 % in the liquid and compressed <b>supercritical</b> <b>states,</b> but near the critical temperature and pressure, the uncertainty increases to 1 %.|$|R
25|$|Supercritical {{hydrolysis}} is {{a method}} of converting all biomass polysaccharides as well the associated lignin into low molecular compounds by contacting with water alone under supercritical conditions. The supercritical water, acts as a solvent, a supplier of bond-breaking thermal energy, a heat transfer agent and {{as a source of}} hydrogen atoms. All polysaccharides are converted into simple sugars in near-quantitative yield in a second or less. The aliphatic inter-ring linkages of lignin are also readily cleaved into free radicals that are stabilized by hydrogen originating from the water. The aromatic rings of the lignin are unaffected under short reaction times so that the lignin-derived products are low molecular weight mixed phenols. To take advantage of the very short reaction times needed for cleavage a continuous reaction system must be devised. The amount of water heated to a <b>supercritical</b> <b>state</b> is thereby minimized.|$|E
500|$|Carbonaceous shales, {{such as the}} Marcellus, are a {{possible}} target for {{carbon capture and storage}} for mitigation of global warming. Because carbon adsorbs carbon dioxide(CO2) at a greater rate than methane(CH4), carbon dioxide injected into the formation for geological sequestration could also be used to recover additional natural gas in a process analogous to enhanced coal bed methane recovery, but the practical value of this theoretical technique is not yet known. Scientists believe that adsorption would allow sequestration at shallower depths than absorption in deep saline formations, which must be at least [...] below the surface to maintain liquid CO2 in a <b>supercritical</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
500|$|Kerogen is {{tightly bound}} to the shale and resists {{dissolution}} by most solvents. Despite this constraint, extraction using especially reactive fluids has been tested, including those in a <b>supercritical</b> <b>state.</b> Reactive fluid technologies are suitable for processing oil shales with a low hydrogen content. In these technologies, hydrogen gas (H2) or hydrogen donors (chemicals that donate hydrogen during chemical reactions) react with coke precursors (chemical structures in the oil shale that are prone to form char during retorting but have not yet done so). [...] Reactive fluid technologies include the IGT Hytort (high-pressure H2) process, donor solvent processes, and the Chattanooga fluidized bed reactor. [...] In the IGT Hytort oil shale is processed in a high-pressure hydrogen environment. [...] The Chattanooga process uses a fluidized bed reactor and an associated hydrogen-fired heater for oil shale thermal cracking and hydrogenation. [...] Laboratory results indicate that these technologies can often obtain significantly higher oil yields than pyrolysis processes. [...] Drawbacks are the additional cost and complexity of hydrogen production and high-pressure retort vessels.|$|E

Because air-drying causes collapse and shrinkage, this is commonly achieved by replacement {{of water in the}} cells with organic solvents such as ethanol or acetone, and replacement of these solvents in turn with a transitional fluid such as liquid carbon dioxide by critical point drying.

For the symmetric case, the eigenfunctions of the <b>supercritical</b> <b>states</b> are expressed as spheroidal wave functions, and approximate analytical expressions are obtained for the corresponding eigenvalues. A universal condition for any square integrable symmetric potential is obtained for the minimum strength of the potential required to hold a bound state of zero energy.

30|$|The {{liquefaction}} of Japanese beech (Fagus crenata Blume) was {{studied with}} various straight-chain alcohols in subcritical and <b>supercritical</b> <b>states</b> using a batch-type reaction vessel to obtain liquid fuel from lignocellulosics. Under the reaction condition of 270 °C, beech wood was liquefied {{to some extent}} in all alcohols with about 50 %– 65 % insoluble residue left after treatment for 30 min. Under the condition of 350 °C, however, more than 90 % of wood was decomposed and liquefied in all alcohols. Alcohols with longer alkyl chains liquefied lignocellulosics in shorter reaction times. Because many kinds of alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, can be produced from biomass, 100 % biomass-based liquid fuel can be prepared by supercritical alcohol technology when using such bioalcohols.|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} numerical framework utilizing multi-element unstructured CFD and rigorous real fluid property routines {{has been}} developed to carry out analyses of propellant tank and delivery systems at NASA SSC. Traditionally CFD modeling of pressurization and mixing in cryogenic tanks has been difficult primarily because the fluids in the tank co-exist in different sub-critical and <b>supercritical</b> <b>states</b> with largely varying properties {{that have to be}} accurately accounted for in order to predict the correct mixing and phase change between the ullage and the propellant. For example, during tank pressurization under some circumstances, rapid mixing of relatively warm pressurant gas with cryogenic propellant can lead to rapid densification of the gas and loss of pressure in the tank. This phenomenon can cause serious problems during testing because of the resulting decrease in propellant flow rate. With proper physical models implemented, CFD can model the coupling between the propellant and pressurant including heat transfer and phase change effects and accurately capture the complex physics in the evolving flowfields. This holds the promise of allowing the specification of operational conditions and procedures that could minimize the undesirable mixing and heat transfer inherent in propellant tank operation. In our modeling framework, we incorporated two different approaches to real fluids modeling: (a) the first approach is based on the HBMS model developed by Hirschfelder, Beuler, McGee and Sutton and (b) the second approach is based on a cubic equation of state developed by Soave, Redlich and Kwong (SRK). Both approaches cover fluid properties and property variation spanning sub-critical gas and liquid states as well as the <b>supercritical</b> <b>states.</b> Both models were rigorously tested and properties for common fluids such as oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen etc were compared against NIST data in both the sub-critical as well as supercritical regimes...|$|R
