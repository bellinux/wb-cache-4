25|$|Growth and yield- Pignut hickory often grows 24 to 27 m (80 to 90ft) {{tall and}} {{occasionally}} reaches 37m (120ft), with d.b.h. of 91 to 122cm (36 to 48 in). The bole is often forked. Height and diameter by age are <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>table</b> 1 for selected locations. Diameter growth of pignut hickory (along with chestnut oak, white oak, sweet birch (Betula lenta), and American beech is rated slow. Since hickories constitute 15 {{percent or less}} of the basal area of oak-hickory forest types, most growth and yield information is written in terms of oak rather than oak-hickory. Yields of mixed oak stands (5,7,19) and of hickory stands (2) have been reported. Tree volume tables are available (2,19).|$|E
500|$|By 1636 tulips were {{traded on}} the exchanges of {{numerous}} Dutch towns and cities. This encouraged trading in tulips by all members of society; Mackay recounted people selling or trading their other possessions in order to speculate in the tulip market, such as an offer of [...] of land for one of two existing Semper Augustus bulbs, or a single bulb of the Viceroy that was purchased for a basket of goods (<b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>table)</b> worth 2,500 florins.|$|E
500|$|The Netherlands, {{which is}} the most {{important}} source of flower bulbs worldwide is also a major centre of narcissus production. Of 16,700 hectares (ha) under cultivation for flower bulbs, narcissi account for about 1,800 hectares. In the 1990s narcissus bulb production was at 260 million, sixth in size after tulips, gladioli, irises, crocuses and lilies and in 2012 it was ranked third. About two-thirds of the area under cultivation is dedicated to about 20 of the most popular varieties. In the 2009/2010 season 470 cultivars were produced on 1578ha.

2500|$|Black {{and white}} waters differ {{significantly}} in their ionic composition, as <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Table</b> 1. [...] Black waters are more acidic, {{resulting in an}} aluminum concentration {{greater than that of}} the more neutral white waters. [...] The major difference is the concentrations of sodium, magnesium, calcium and potassium; these are very low in black waters. [...] This has ecological implications. Some animals need more calcium than is available in blackwaters, so for example, snails, which need much calcium to build shells, are not abundant in blackwaters. The lack of dissolved ions in black waters results in a low conductivity, similar to that of rainwater.|$|E
2500|$|Similar {{converging}} {{evidence suggests}} modularity for color. Beginning with Gowers’ finding [...] that {{damage to the}} fusiform/lingual gyri in occipitotemporal cortex correlates with a loss in color perception (achromatopsia), {{the notion of a}} [...] "color centre" [...] in the primate brain has had growing support. Again, such clinical evidence only implies that this region is critical to color perception, and nothing more. Other evidence, however, including neuroimaging and physiology converges on V4 as necessary to color perception. A recent meta-analysis has also shown a specific lesion common to achromats corresponding to V4. From another direction altogether it has been found that when synaesthetes experience color by a non-visual stimulus, V4 is active. On the basis of this evidence it would seem that color processing is modular. However, as with motion processing it is likely that this conclusion is inaccurate. Other evidence <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Table</b> 3 implies different areas’ involvement with color. It may thus be more instructive to consider a multistage color processing stream from the retina through to cortical areas including at least V1, V2, V4, PITd and TEO. Consonant with motion perception, {{there appears to be a}} constellation of areas drawn upon for color perception. In addition, V4 may have a special, but not exclusive, role. For example, single cell recording has shown that only V4 cells respond to the color of a stimuli rather than its waveband, whereas other areas involved with color do not.|$|E

2500|$|Scott et al. (2005) {{similarly}} {{observed that}} the Ethiopian population is almost equally divided between individuals that carry Eurasian maternal lineages, and those that belong to African clades. They describe the presence of Eurasian clades in the country as sequences that [...] "are thought {{to be found in}} high numbers in Ethiopia either as a result of substantial gene flow into Ethiopia from Eurasia (Chen et al., 2000; Richards et al., 2003), or as a result of having undergone several branching events in demic diffusion, acting as founder lineages for non-African populations". The researchers further found no association between regional origin of subjects or language family (Semitic/Cushitic) and their mitochondrial type: [...] The haplogroup distribution amongst all subjects (athletes and controls) from different geographical regions of Ethiopia is displayed in Table 3. As can be seen graphically in Fig. 3, the mtDNA haplogroup distribution of each region is similar, with all regions displaying similar proportions of African 'L' haplogroups (Addis Ababa: 59%, Arsi: 50%, Shewa: 44%, Other: 57%). No association was found between regional origin of subjects and their mitochondrial type (v2=8.5, 15 df, P=0.9). Similarly, the mtDNA haplogroup distribution of subjects (athletes and controls) speaking languages from each family is <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Table</b> 3. Again there was no association between language family and mitochondrial type (v2=5.4, 5 df, P=0.37).
