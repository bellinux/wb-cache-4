5|$|In Inner Mongolia, {{official}} language policy divides the Mongolian language into three dialects: <b>Southern</b> Mongolian, Oirat, and Barghu-Buryat. <b>Southern</b> Mongolian {{is said to}} consist of Chakhar, Ordos, Baarin, Khorchin, Kharchin, and Alasha. The authorities have synthesized a literary standard for Mongolian in whose grammar {{is said to be}} based on <b>Southern</b> Mongolian and whose pronunciation is based on the Chakhar dialect as spoken in the Plain Blue Banner. Dialectologically, however, western <b>Southern</b> Mongolian dialects are closer to Khalkha than they are to eastern <b>Southern</b> Mongolian dialects: for example, Chakhar is closer to Khalkha than to Khorchin.|$|E

5|$|Large {{explosive}} eruptions in the <b>southern</b> {{segment of}} the <b>Southern</b> Volcanic Zone occur on average every 725 years, and tephras from volcanoes in the <b>Southern</b> Volcanic Zone have been transported over large distances. The largest Holocene volcanic eruption of the <b>Southern</b> Andes occurred 6,700 years before present at Cerro Hudson. Tephra layers found at Mallín El Embudo {{have been attributed to}} Mentolat, as well as to Melimoyu and Cerro Hudson.|$|E

5|$|The {{focus of}} the search shifted to the <b>Southern</b> Indian Ocean west of Australia and within Australia's {{aeronautical}} and maritime Search and Rescue regions that extend to 75°E longitude. Accordingly, on 17 March, Australia agreed to lead the search in the <b>southern</b> locus from Sumatra to the <b>southern</b> Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The mallard {{is widely}} {{distributed}} across the Northern and <b>Southern</b> Hemispheres; in North America its range extends from <b>southern</b> and central Alaska to Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands, across Eurasia, from Iceland and <b>southern</b> Greenland {{and parts of}} Morocco (North Africa) in the west, Scandinavia and Britain to the north, and to Siberia, Japan, and South Korea, in the east, south-eastern and south-western Australia and New Zealand in the <b>Southern</b> hemisphere. It is strongly migratory in the northern parts of its breeding range, and winters farther south. For example, in North America, it winters south to the <b>southern</b> United States and northern Mexico, but also regularly strays into Central America and the Caribbean between September and May.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} part of the commune is hilly but relatively favorable to agriculture, while the <b>southern</b> part is flat and characterized by sand dunes.

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed in the Bay of Bengal passed over the <b>southern</b> Indian subcontinent and developed into a depression in the Arabian Sea off the <b>southern</b> Maharashtra coast on October 11. The depression did not develop as it drifted west, and it degenerated into an area of {{low pressure}} as it was approaching the Arabian Peninsula. The depression brought widespread rains to <b>southern</b> Maharashtra and Karnataka states, with 40mm (1.5in) of rain recorded in Karwar. Scattered heavy rain was also reported in the Laccadives.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 2,409 <b>Southern</b> Rhodesians (977 {{officers}} and 1,432 other ranks) {{served in the}} RAF during the war, 373 (86 officers and 287 ratings) joined the Royal Navy, and 13 officers and 36 ratings from <b>Southern</b> Rhodesia mustered into the South African Navy. The {{vast majority of the}} rest served in either the <b>Southern</b> Rhodesian territorial forces or the British or South African Army. The colony's men and women received 698 decorations during the war; whites received 689 while black troops won nine. No coloured or Indian serviceman was decorated. Army officers won 269 decorations while the other ranks received 158; the air force officers and other ranks respectively won 184 and 72 decorations.

5|$|A. r. australis, {{described}} by Edward William Nelson in 1897, occurs in <b>southern</b> Mexico from Guerrero to <b>southern</b> Puebla and Oaxaca. A. r. scottii {{is similar in}} appearance, but this subspecies is smaller and has a shorter bill.|$|E
5|$|A. r. boucardi was {{described}} by Philip Sclater in 1867, and it is found in eastern Mexico from <b>southern</b> Coahuila to San Luis Potosí, northern Puebla, and <b>southern</b> Oaxaca. This subspecies is darker than A. r. eremoeca and has dull brown, not rufous, streaking on the chest.|$|E
5|$|After <b>Southern</b> Democrats {{walked out}} of the 1860 Democratic National Convention, the party's {{northern}} and <b>southern</b> factions held rival conventions in Baltimore that nominated Douglas and Breckinridge, respectively, for president. A third party, the Constitutional Union Party, nominated John Bell. These three men split the <b>Southern</b> vote, while more anti-slavery Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won all but three electoral votes in the North, allowing him to win the election. Breckinridge carried most of the <b>Southern</b> states. Taking his seat in the Senate, Breckinridge urged compromise to preserve the Union. Unionists were in control of the state legislature, and gained more support when Confederate forces moved into Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of World War I (also known as the First World War or the Great War), <b>Southern</b> Rhodesia was {{administered}} by the British South Africa Company, which had controlled it and Northern Rhodesia since acquiring them through diplomacy and conquest during the 1890s. The white population in <b>Southern</b> Rhodesia stood at 23,606 in 1911 (a minority of 3%), while Northern Rhodesia had about 3,000 white settlers (less than half of 1%). With the Company's charter due to expire in late 1914, most <b>Southern</b> Rhodesian public attention was focused on this issue before the outbreak of war. The settlers were split between those who backed continued administration by the Chartered Company and those who advocated responsible government, which would make <b>Southern</b> Rhodesia a self-governing colony within the British Empire. Still others favoured the integration of <b>Southern</b> Rhodesia into the Union of South Africa, which had been formed in 1910. Following {{the intervention of the}} war, the charter was renewed for 10 years in early 1915.|$|E
5|$|Boletopsis nothofagi is {{the most}} <b>southern</b> member of the genus Boletopsis, and as of 2013 the sole known member of the genus in the <b>Southern</b> Hemisphere; its closest {{relatives}} are found in Asia and Costa Rica.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{northern}} and <b>southern</b> segments of the US395 corridor were used by railroads built in the 1880s branching from the First Transcontinental Railroad in Nevada. Both lines were intended to connect the main <b>Southern</b> Pacific Railroad line in Nevada with other lines, but were never completed.|$|E
5|$|C. t. taurinus (Burchell, 1823; Blue {{wildebeest}}, common wildebeest or brindled gnu) {{is found}} in <b>southern</b> Africa. Its range extends from Namibia and South Africa to Mozambique (north of the Orange River) and from southwestern Zambia (south of the Zambezi river) to <b>southern</b> Angola.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{interaction}} was also intense with the Italian peninsula {{and the western}} Mediterranean. Mycenaean products, especially pottery, were exported to <b>southern</b> Italy, Sicily and the Aeolian islands. Mycenaean products also penetrated further into Sardinia, as well as <b>southern</b> Spain.|$|E
5|$|Cuba was {{of special}} {{importance}} to <b>Southern</b> Democrats, who believed their {{economic and political}} interests would be best served by the admission of another slave state to the Union. The existence of slavery in Cuba, the island's plantation economy based on sugar, and its geographical location predisposed it to <b>Southern</b> influence; its admission would greatly strengthen the position of <b>Southern</b> slaveholders, whose way of life was under fire from Northern abolitionists. Whereas immigration to Northern industrial centers had resulted in Northern control of the population-based House of Representatives, <b>Southern</b> politicians sought to maintain the fragile {{balance of power in}} the Senate, where each state received equal representation. As slavery-free Western states were admitted, <b>Southern</b> politicians increasingly looked to Cuba as the next slave state. If Cuba were admitted to the Union as a single state, the island would have sent two senators and up to nine representatives to Washington.|$|E
5|$|Early in Lenny's duration, a {{tropical}} storm warning and hurricane watch were issued for Jamaica. Later, a hurricane watch was issued for the <b>southern</b> coast of Hispaniola, and {{a tropical}} storm warning was also issued for the Dominican Republic. Haitian officials {{declared a state of}} alert in three <b>southern</b> provinces and allocated about $1million (1999USD) in hurricane funds. Residents in flood-prone areas were advised to evacuate in <b>southern</b> Haiti and in the neighboring Dominican Republic.|$|E

5|$|Following relegation to the <b>Southern</b> League Second Division in 1903, Watford {{appointed}} {{its first}} manager – former England international and First Division top scorer John Goodall. He led Watford to promotion, {{and kept the}} team in the division until his departure in 1910. Despite financial constraints, Watford won the <b>Southern</b> League title in the 1914–15 season under his successor, Harry Kent. Watford held the title for five years following the suspension of the <b>Southern</b> League during the First World War – after finishing the 1919–20 season runners-up on goal average, the club resigned from the <b>Southern</b> League to join the new Football League Third Division.|$|E
5|$|From the <b>southern</b> {{terminus}} at SH-7, the <b>southern</b> {{section of}} SH-74 goes due north to Elmore City, where it intersects with SH-29.

Still continuing northward, the highway meets the <b>southern</b> terminus of State Highway 24, and continues into Purcell.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{held the}} Georgia <b>Southern</b> {{baseball}} record for appearances, starts, complete games, innings pitched and strikeouts until 1995. He {{was elected to}} the Georgia <b>Southern</b> University Athletics Department Hall of Fame in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{was appalled}} when Britain made India {{independent}} in 1947—he {{held that the}} British government had unnecessarily caved in to Indian nationalist demands and should have continued in the subcontinent indefinitely. He retained this view for years afterwards. He retired from the RAF in April 1949 with the rank of wing commander, and the same year emigrated to <b>Southern</b> Rhodesia, a British colony in <b>southern</b> Africa that had been self-governing since 1923. He settled in the central town of Gatooma, where he farmed, mined and set up an earth-moving contractor's business. In 1953, <b>Southern</b> Rhodesia became a territory of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland alongside Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Each territory retained its own political status and government, and <b>Southern</b> Rhodesia's constitutional status was unaltered.|$|E
5|$|Harrison was {{admitted}} to the New York State bar in 1892 and worked for the law firm Bangs, Stetson, Tracy & MacVeagh from 1892 to 1896. He then joined the <b>Southern</b> Railway Company in May 1896 as a lawyer, becoming an assistant to the company's president in 1903. He served as vice-president in charge of finance and accounting from 1906. During the Panic of 1907, Harrison successfully persuaded J. P. Morgan to purchase bonds in the <b>Southern</b> to keep the company solvent. After the panic had subsided, Harrison was named president of the Chicago, Indianapolis and Louisville Railway, later the Monon Railroad (succeeded Ira G. Rawn after Rawn's death), which was jointly owned by <b>Southern</b> and the Louisville & Nashville Railroad. William Finley, president of the <b>Southern</b> Railway, died on November 23, 1913, and Harrison was elected as his successor eight days later. Besides the chairmanship of the <b>Southern</b> Railway, he was also elected to succeed Finley on three subsidiary railroads. His election was considered to be a sign of change in the <b>Southern</b> United States, especially in its railroads, both because he was a southerner and for his activism on behalf of the south.|$|E
5|$|Having been governed and {{developed}} by the British South Africa Company since the 1890s, <b>Southern</b> Rhodesia became a self-governing colony within the British Empire in 1923, when it was granted responsible government by Whitehall. The <b>Southern</b> Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, was henceforth empowered to run its own affairs in almost all matters, including defence. Foreign affairs {{was one of the}} few areas reserved by the British government. As the Empire's lone self-governing colony, <b>Southern</b> Rhodesia was considered a sui generis case, almost on a par with a dominion. Starting in 1932, Imperial Conferences included the <b>Southern</b> Rhodesian Prime Minister alongside those from the dominions, a unique situation which continued after Imperial Conferences were superseded by Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences in 1944.|$|E
5|$|High cliffs, sandbars {{and piles}} of pebbles testify to the {{existence}} of strong wave action on the northeastern shore, which was influenced by strong northwesterly winds. Inversely, the gentle <b>southern</b> slopes of the lake bed probably reduced wave action on the lake's <b>southern</b> shores.|$|E

5|$|In 1923 the L {{was absorbed}} into the <b>Southern</b> Railway, and began an upgrade programme. All locos & coaches were repainted in <b>Southern</b> Maunsell Green livery, the wagons were repainted in <b>Southern</b> Umber livery and track and {{buildings}} were improved. A fifth locomotive, Lew was purchased in 1925, with improvements to the original Manning Wardle design.|$|E
