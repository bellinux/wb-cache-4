Maxwell was put in charge of the {{development}} of the Cavendish Laboratory, supervising every step in the progress of the building and of the purchase of the collection of apparatus. One of Maxwell's last great contributions to science was the editing (with copious original notes) of the research of Henry Cavendish, from which it appeared that Cavendish researched, amongst other things, <b>such</b> <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> the density of the Earth and the composition of water.|$|E
25|$|Although the Chinese Room {{argument}} was originally presented {{in reaction to}} the statements of AI researchers, philosophers have come to view it as {{an important part of the}} philosophy of mind. It is a challenge to functionalism and the computational theory of mind, and is related to <b>such</b> <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> the mind–body problem, the problem of other minds, the symbol-grounding problem, and the hard problem of consciousness.|$|E
25|$|The Model {{is divided}} into three sections. In the first Scott defines poetry, making his debts to earlier theorists clear: All antiquity, {{following}} their great leader Aristotle, have defined poetry to be an art of imitation, or an instrument of reason, that consists in laying down the rules and way how in style to feign or represent things, with delight to teach to move us to good; as if one should say with the lyric Simonides (after whom Sir Philip Sidney saith) the poem is a speaking or wordish picture' (Cambridge edition, p. 6). Scott then discusses the 'genus' (matter), difference' (form) and 'end' of poetry in turn, dealing with <b>such</b> <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> the source of poetic inspiration, and the temperament required of the poet.|$|E

[...] With the Sino-Soviet split also deepening the Soviet leadership began applying its first signs of economic pressure on Albania in March 1960, stating its intention to alter a scholarship agreement for Albanians to study in the USSR in which the Soviets paid 60% of tuition costs and upkeep for the students; this threat was subsequently retracted {{on the eve of}} the Bucharest Conference in June that year, possibly in an attempt not to push Albania further into the Chinese orbit.|$|E
500|$|The Romney Literary Society was {{organized}} on January 30, 1819, by nine prominent men of Romney {{in the office}} of Dr. John Temple, a reputable physician in the community. The society was formed with the purpose [...] "of taking into consideration the propriety of financing a Society, having for its object the advancement of Literature and Science, the purchase of a Library by and for the use of its members; and their further improvement by discussing before the Society <b>such</b> <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> shall be selected under its directors." [...] With its establishment, the Romney Literary Society became the first organization {{of its kind in the}} present-day state of West Virginia, and one of the first in the United States. The nine men at the society's first meeting were Thomas Blair, David Gibson, James P. Jack, Samuel Kercheval, Jr., Nathaniel Kuykendall, Charles T. Magill, James M. Stephens, John Temple, and William C. Wodrow. According to historian Hu Maxwell, these men elected Kuykendall as chairman and Magill as secretary of a committee which was charged with the drafting of a constitution for the society.|$|E

[...] The nine men consisted of Thomas Blair, David Gibson, James P. Jack, Virginia author and historian Samuel Kercheval, Nathaniel Kuykendall, Charles T. Magill, James M. Stephens, John Temple, and W.C. Wodrow. Shortly after the formation of the Romney Literary Society, the society recognized that the quality of the education provided by Romney Academy and other local subscription schools was not meeting the needs of the Romney community, and therefore, it launched a movement to establish an institution for [...] "the higher education of the youth of the community". The society frequently debated upon theories of education advancement and popular education. In 1820, {{as a result of this}} movement and debate, Romney Academy incorporated classical studies into its curriculum, thus making it the first institution of higher education in the region. The institution was again incorporated by the Virginia General Assembly on March25, 1820.|$|E

[...] During {{recording}} sessions, Waters recruited both the staff and the temporary occupants of the studio to answer {{a series of questions}} printed on flashcards.

[...] Questions such as [...] "When {{was the last time you}} were violent?", followed immediately by [...] "Were you in the right?", were answered in the order they were presented. Roger [...] "The Hat" [...] Manifold proved difficult to find, and was the only contributor recorded in a conventional sit-down interview, as by then the flashcards had been mislaid. [...] Waters asked him about a violent encounter he had had with another motorist, and Manifold replied [...] "...give 'em a quick, short, sharp shock..." [...] When asked about death he responded [...] "live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me..." [...] Another roadie, Chris Adamson, who was on tour with Pink Floyd, recorded the snippet which opens the album: [...] "I've been mad for fucking years – absolutely years".

2500|$|Various {{theories}} {{and views of}} truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians.

A feminist approach to epistemology seeks to establish knowledge production from a woman's perspective.
