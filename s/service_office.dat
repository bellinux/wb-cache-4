5|$|The Guam National Weather <b>Service</b> <b>office</b> {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for the Marshall Islands shortly after Pongsona developed into {{a tropical storm}}, and a day later watches were issued for Chuuk. On December 5, the service issued tropical storm warnings for parts of the Federated States of Micronesia. As Pongsona became a typhoon, the Guam National Weather <b>Service</b> <b>office</b> issued a typhoon watch for Guam, Rota, Saipan, and Tinian, which was upgraded to a typhoon warning about 23hours prior to the onset of tropical storm-force winds; typhoon warnings were also issued for the unpopulated island of Agrihan. By one day before the typhoon moved through the Mariana Islands, JTWC predicted Pongsona to pass well east of the area. Despite a more westward track than anticipated, forecasts remained stagnant until the morning of December 8, when forecasters reluctantly predicted much greater threat to the Mariana Islands. As a result, many citizens felt they were unprepared and insufficiently warned for the typhoon.|$|E

40|$|With {{particular}} {{reference to}} {{its role in}} the corporate real estate supply chain, this paper focuses on how the <b>serviced</b> <b>office</b> sector in the UK has evolved and changed over the last decade. A qualitative research approach involving 21 semi-structured interviews with corporate clients of <b>serviced</b> <b>office</b> operators was used to address a number of issues regarding the perceptions of users of <b>serviced</b> <b>offices.</b> It is concluded that the <b>serviced</b> <b>office</b> sector has become an established sector of the UKâ€™s commercial real estate market providing an essential product for many corporate organisations. The <b>serviced</b> <b>office</b> sector has been relatively nimble and a range of operational models have emerged. It was found that corporate organisations use <b>serviced</b> <b>office</b> space and <b>services</b> in order to align workforce change with portfolio change, to transfer risk, for short-term project space, as temporary overflow space, to pilot a new location, to become familiar with a specific geographical marketplace or simply to gain an initial presence in an area...|$|R

Ewiniar also caused an island-wide power outage in Yap, although according to an NWS post-storm report, damage was minimised on Yap due to steadier structures after Super Typhoon Sudal of 2004 tore through the islands. Damage was also reported to agriculture due to salt spray. The total amount of damage caused {{was estimated to be}} just over $100 thousand (2006USD).|$|E

40|$|The work {{environment}} has experienced tremendous {{change in the}} past few decades. Technology has been the prime catalyst to transform the demand for office space into a search for more flexible solutions in a historically inflexible asset. <b>Serviced</b> <b>offices</b> combine office space, technology and support into a global network of fully furnished, staffed and equipped offices and meeting rooms, available to occupy or vacate on flexible terms, and tailored to the specific business needs of the users. This thesis explores the objectives of these users, product and service characteristics of the <b>serviced</b> <b>office</b> space delivered to them, and the relationship between the users and the providers of <b>serviced</b> <b>office</b> space. Further, it explores the similarities and differences of big and small providers emerging as the market of <b>serviced</b> <b>office</b> space matures. The methodologies of the service profit chain are used to compare the relevant service delivery methods used by big and small <b>serviced</b> <b>office</b> providers. by Scott Peltier. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{aim of this}} essey was to {{find out}} what kind of help problem gamblers can get at social <b>service</b> <b>offices</b> in the region VÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland in Sweden. We also {{examined}} the knowledge regarding gambling problems at social sevice offices and who the head of the social <b>service</b> <b>offices</b> regarded having the responsibility for the question of helping problem gamblers. As a last question we wanted to know if the size of the population in the community had an impact on these questions. Central questions in our essey asked are: How much help does the social <b>service</b> <b>offices</b> in the region VÃ¤sra GÃ¶taland offer problem gamblers? Who has the responsabilety to help problem gamblers according to social <b>service</b> <b>offices?</b> What knowledge does the social <b>service</b> <b>offices</b> have concerning problem gambling? Does the population of the community have an impact on theese questions? This is a quantitative study made as a webbservey {{to the head of the}} social <b>service</b> <b>offices</b> in the region VÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland. The result shows that itÂ´s easier to get the right help in bigger communities than in the smaller communities. It also shows that the most of the social <b>service</b> <b>offices</b> offers more help than they have to according to them selves, but some social service offers no help at all. The knowledge about problem gambling and the knowledge about responsability in the problem gambling question is at a fair level in some communities but in some other communities it's much lower...|$|R

5|$|The {{passage of}} the Act in the Irish Parliament was {{ultimately}} achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799.
