5|$|Asuma is a male wizard with a {{frivolous}} {{personality and}} {{is the director of}} Kamisaid Magic Academy. He likes using magic to surprise others, such as making flowers and small birds appear out of nowhere. His sacrifice for magic is that he ages quickly. For example, when Misaki was saved by him, she was <b>surprised</b> <b>he</b> had aged a few years in one day.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not having}} listened to heavy metal since age 13 or 14 {{in favor of}} new wave, Kijak was {{immediately}} drawn to the band's music, <b>surprised</b> <b>he</b> had never heard it before. He bonded {{with some of the}} band members; learning that Kiss' Love Gun was the first album he, Yoshiki and Toshi had ever bought and talking with Sugizo about the British new wave band Japan and its bassist Mick Karn, who was a friend of the guitarist.|$|E
5|$|In Nikki Stafford's analysis, the {{reactions}} of Buffy, Dawn, Xander, Willow, Anya, and Tara represent stages of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross' five stages of grief in different parts. Joss Whedon stated on the DVD commentary how <b>surprised</b> <b>he</b> was at the response from viewers who wrote {{to say that the}} episode allowed them to accept the death of a close family member, even if they had not acknowledged it for months or years. Joyce's death was the first by natural causes in the series.|$|E

Bart instantly develops a crush on her.|$|E
5|$|Critics praised Undead Nightmare as a {{model for}} {{downloadable}} content especially in its balance of content and price. Neil Davey (The Guardian) said that it was the best purchase of 2010 at its price range, but staff of the Official Xbox Magazine found the price slightly too high. Henry Gilbert of GamesRadar thought that the game's concept sounded like a ploy to make easy money without much work, but admitted how wrong and <b>surprised</b> <b>he</b> was at the game's depth. At the time of its 2010 release, the Official Xbox Magazine counted Undead Nightmare among the best downloadable content in existence. The standalone retail disc had sold two million units as of August 2011. No sales figures were released regarding the download pack itself.|$|E
5|$|Shrek and Donkey {{travel to}} the castle and split up to find Fiona. They are noticed by the dragon, who corners Donkey. In desperation he sweet-talks the beast, {{learning}} that it is female. Dragon {{falls in love with}} Donkey and carries him to her chambers. Shrek finds Fiona, who is appalled at his lack of romanticism and <b>surprised</b> <b>he</b> hadn't slain Dragon. As they leave, Shrek saves Donkey from Dragon, who is heartbroken as a result. At first, Fiona is thrilled to be rescued but is quickly disappointed when Shrek reveals he is an ogre. She demands that Farquaad come to get her himself, but Shrek forcibly carries her with him. The three have several adventures on their way to Duloc, such as an encounter with Robin Hood wherein Fiona reveals that she is an expert martial artist.

5|$|Trainspotting {{director}} Danny Boyle was the producers' {{first choice}} {{to direct the}} film. Boyle and his producer met with effects supervisors to discuss the film, {{but he was not}} interested in pursuing the project and went on to make A Life Less Ordinary instead. Peter Jackson was also approached, but declined as he could not get excited about an Alien film. In 1995, after the release of The Usual Suspects, 20th Century Fox approached Bryan Singer to direct. Jean-Pierre Jeunet was asked to direct, as the film's producers believed he had a unique visual style. Jeunet had just completed the script to Amélie and was <b>surprised</b> <b>he</b> was offered the job for Alien Resurrection, as he thought the franchise had finished with Alien 3 and believed that making a sequel was a bad idea. Jeunet, however, accepted the project with a budget of $70 million. He required an interpreter as he did not speak much English when filming began.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was <b>surprised</b> <b>he</b> was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E

25|$|Hearne {{made his}} debut for Kent in 1884 as a leg-break bowler. He headed the County's bowling averages, taking 41 wickets in a {{generally}} dry summer, and playing {{a crucial role}} Kent's defeat of the touring Australian side with match figures of seven wickets for 66 runs. He enjoyed a good record against Australian touring sides, with Kent winning {{five of the seven}} tour matches played against Australia between 1884 and 1899, and critics were <b>surprised</b> <b>he</b> was not chosen to play for England against Australia at some point during his career.|$|E
25|$|In 1912 {{then head}} of the {{religion}} `Abdu'l-Bahá took a journey to the West from what was then Palestine. On one leg of his trips {{as he was leaving}} Canada, {{on the way back to}} the States, and he traveled through several villages. As the train passed through the town of Belleville, Ontario, a four-year-old Mohawk boy, Jimmy Loft, was sitting on a fence as the train passed. `Abdu'l-Bahá took that moment to stand up and, facing the window, smile and wave. Loft was so <b>surprised</b> <b>he</b> toppled off the fence. In May 1948 he became one of the first native American Bahá'ís of Canada.|$|E
25|$|When {{news of the}} {{purchase}} reached the United States, Jefferson was <b>surprised.</b> <b>He</b> had authorized the expenditure of $10 million for a port city, and instead received treaties committing the government to spend $15 million on a land package which would double {{the size of the}} country. Jefferson's political opponents in the Federalist Party argued the Louisiana purchase was a worthless desert, and that the Constitution did not provide for the acquisition of new land or negotiating treaties without the consent of the Senate. What really worried the opposition was the new states which would inevitably be carved from the Louisiana territory, strengthening Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England Federalists in national affairs. President Jefferson was an enthusiastic supporter of westward expansion, and held firm in his support for the treaty. Despite Federalist objections, the U.S. Senate ratified the Louisiana treaty on October 20, 1803.|$|E

25|$|C.J. Barnes, {{portrayed by}} David Spade (2004–2005), is Cate's nephew. He was {{once in the}} Army and claims to have studied aerial {{photography}} during the Gulf War, and to have received a Purple Heart in combat, which is in complete contrast with his generally childish attitude. He is {{a teacher at the}} school and often pursues women, albeit unsuccessfully. When C.J. first arrives, the family is initially <b>surprised.</b> <b>He</b> reveals to them that he was ashamed that he did not live up to be the person Paul had once said he would be and avoided them because of that. He lives along with his grandfather, Jim, in the basement (having previously lived in a van, which was burned by that same grandfather). He once dated Mrs. Krupp, his cousins' (Kerry and Bridget) math teacher, but he ended up cheating on her with his ex-girlfriend Cheryl. He once revealed that his first initial stands for Corey, but Rory said that was untrue. C.J. previously smoked marijuana heavily (and in fact used to smoke with Kyle's older brother), but at the start of his appearances, he claims not to have touched it in two years (he originally claimed it was five, though he relented after Jim expressed disbelief).|$|E
500|$|Barcelona {{exited the}} semi-final {{stage of the}} UEFA Cup to Liverpool in April 2001. Serra Ferrer was sacked a week later and {{replaced}} by Carles Rexach. As the season drew to a close, Overmars turned into an influential player for Barcelona. Lowe labelled him as [...] "Barça's only decent player in recent weeks" [...] and was <b>surprised</b> <b>he</b> started on the bench against Real Valladolid in June 2001. When Overmars came on, he scored the equaliser to earn Barcelona a 2–2 draw. The team ended the campaign in fourth place after a dramatic 3–2 win against Valencia.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{repeatedly}} tells a {{story from}} when she was 14 years old and bouldering in Joshua Tree: she succeeded on a route when a man came over and commented how <b>surprised</b> <b>he</b> was that she could do the route because even he could not. [...] "I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could do it? Just because I was a small girl, was I {{not to be able}} to do it? It was a memorable experience because it occurred to me then that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing. I think that people should just do whatever they can do or want to do. It shouldn't be a matter of if they're a man or a woman. It shouldn't be a matter of one's sex." ...|$|E

500|$|Malone {{credited}} Howarth's versatility {{with the}} reason he was cast as Todd. [...] During a February 1993 interview with Soap Opera Digest (SOD), Howarth stated he was <b>surprised</b> <b>he</b> won the part. [...] "I really don't know how I made it," [...] he said. He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he [...] "auditioned just like everybody else". He [...] "made it to callbacks, and [...] got the part". Howarth said, [...] "I was hired... to plant drugs in Jason Webb's jacket. All I knew was that my first name was Todd. I don't know what happened next. They called me in again and suddenly I had a last name 'Manning.' Then I get called to read another day." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, Schwimmer {{made his}} Off-Broadway directorial debut in Fault Lines at the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York. The {{production}} won a mixed review from the Los Angeles Times, which wrote: [...] "Based on Fault Lines... we can't really tell whether Schwimmer has much talent as a director. We're <b>surprised</b> <b>he</b> didn't try something more challenging for his debut. If not much else, Schwimmer has encouraged his actors to intense their energy levels and comic timing at all costs". The New York Post, however, noted that Schwimmer [...] "knows {{a thing or}} two about freewheeling banter... and for a good while the play crackles with terrific dialogue, expertly delivered". In February 2009, he returned to theater in a Chicago production of Thornton Wilder's three-act play Our Town as George Gibbs at the Lookingglass Theatre. [...] "Schwimmer... turns in a poignant, richly textured and demonstrably heartfelt performance as George Gibbs. I've seen a fair bit of Schwimmer's post-Friends stage work in London and New York, and I've never seen him better", commented the Chicago Tribune.|$|E
500|$|Prevented {{initially}} {{from seeing}} combat {{because of his}} youth, Hardman was eventually posted to No.19 Squadron on the Western Front in February 1918, just as the unit was completing its conversion from SPAD S.VIIs to Sopwith Dolphins. He achieved his first aerial victory in May 1918. On 28September, Hardman was promoted from lieutenant to temporary captain, and appointed as one of No.19 Squadron's flight commanders. He scored two victories in one sortie on 30October 1918, when he led twelve Dolphins escorting DH.9 bombers of No.98 Squadron to Mons; in a dogfight {{that resulted in the}} loss of ten British aircraft, Hardman sent two German Fokker D.VIIs down in flames. His [...] "cool judgment and skill in leading" [...] during this action earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross; the award was promulgated on 11 February 1919. Hardman's final wartime tally was nine victories. The life expectancy for even an experienced RFC pilot on the Western Front was as little as three weeks; years later, Hardman admitted that he was still <b>surprised</b> <b>he</b> had survived.|$|E
