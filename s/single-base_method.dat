40|$|BACKGROUND: We speculated TNF-alpha {{can be one}} of {{candidate}} gene for aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) because TNF-alpha is pro-inflammatory cytokine and known to be increased level in asthmatic airways. In addition, genetic interaction between TNF-alpha and human antigen leucocyte (HLA) DPB 1 * 0301, which is a strong genetic marker for AIA, was examined for its close location within chromosome 6. METHOD: To investigate genetic association of TNF-alpha with an AIA phenotype, three study groups (163 patients with AIA, 197 patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA), 257 normal control subjects) were enrolled. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using a <b>single-base</b> extension <b>method</b> and HLA DPB 1 genotyping was determined by high-throughput sequencing method. RESULTS: All five SNPs of TNF-alpha were tested; {{there were no significant differences}} in allele and genotype frequencies among the three groups. However, significant association between TNF-alpha- 308 G>A polymorphism and atopy status was noted (PT, P< 0. 001, respectively). CONCLUSION: TNF-alpha promoter polymorphism may significantly increase susceptibility to AIA by gene-to-gene interaction with HLA DPB 1 * 0301...|$|R
40|$|A simple primer {{extension}} assay {{has been}} developed to distinguish homologous DNA segments differing by {{as little as a}} single nucleotide. DNA strands are synthesized with one of the four natural nucleotides replaced with an analog that affects electrophoretic mobility. DNAs that are the same length but differ in the number of analog molecules per strand exhibit different mobilities on a sequencing gel. In combination with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR; 1, 2), this method has been used to distinguish mutant and normal alleles of the human insulin receptor gene that differ by a <b>single-base</b> substitution. The <b>method</b> appears to be generally applicable to the detection of any nucleotide polymorphism in any segment of DNA...|$|R
40|$|Background:Failure in the {{regulation}} of homeostatic water balance in the brain is associated with severe cerebral edema and increased brain weights and may also {{play an important role}} in the pathogenesis of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We genotyped three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the aquaporin- 4 water channel-encoding gene (AQP 4), which were previously shown to be associated with (i) SIDS in Norwegian infants (rs 2075575), (ii) severe brain edema (rs 9951307), and (iii) increased brain water permeability (rs 3906956). We also determined whether the brain/body weight ratio is increased in SIDS infants compared with sex- and age-matched controls. Methods:Genotyping of the three AQP 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms was performed in 160 Caucasian SIDS infants and 181 healthy Swiss adults using a <b>single-base</b> extension <b>method.</b> Brain and body weights were measured during autopsy in 157 SIDS and 59 non-SIDS infants. Results:No differences were detected in the allelic frequencies of the three AQP 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms between SIDS and adult controls. The brain/body weight ratio was similarly distributed in SIDS and non-SIDS infants. Conclusion:Variations in the AQP 4 gene seem of limited significance as predisposing factors in Caucasian SIDS infants. Increased brain weights may only become evident in conjunction with environmental or other genetic risk factors...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{technologies}} for identifying genetic polymorphisms rapidly and accurately will dramatically accelerate {{the discovery of}} disease-related genes. Among a variety of newly described methods for rapid typing of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), gene detection using DNA microarrays is gradually achieving widespread use. This method {{involves the use of}} short (11 - to 13 -mer) allele-specific oligonu-cleotides. This method allows simultaneous analysis of many SNPs in DNAs from a large number of individuals, in a single experiment. In this work, we evaluated the accuracy of a new microarray-based short allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization method. There is a 96 -well formatted array on a single plate, in which up to 256 spots are included in each well. Fluorescent probes for our experiments were produced by multiplex PCR amplification of ten target SNP-containing regions. We genotyped 192 in-dividuals across a panel of ten single base variations, which included an insertion/deletion polymorphism. For comparison, we genotyped the same individuals for the same SNPs by the <b>method</b> of <b>single-base</b> exten-sion with fluorescence detection. The typing accuracies of the microarray-based PCR-ASO and <b>single-base</b> extension <b>methods</b> were calculated as 99. 9 % and 99. 1 %, respectively, on the basis of genotyping results de-termined by direct sequencing. We conclude that the microarray-based hybridization method using short ASO probes represents a potential breakthrough technology for typing large numbers of SNPs rapidly and efficiently.

40|$|Abstract Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) is a destruc-tive disease that reduces wheat grain yield and quality. To date, the {{quantitative}} trait locus on 3 BS (Fhb 1) from Sumai 3 has shown the largest effect on FHB resistance. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) {{is the most common}} form of genetic variation and is suitable for high-throughput marker-assisted selection (MAS). We analyzed SNPs derived from 23 wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that previously mapped near Fhb 1 on chromosome 3 BS. Using 71 Ning 7840 /Clark BC 7 F 7 recombinant inbred lines and the <b>single-base</b> extension <b>method,</b> we mapped seven SNP markers between Xgwm 533 and Xgwm 493, flanking markers for Fhb 1. Five of the SNPs explained 45 – 54 % of the phenotypic variation for FHB resis-tance. Haplotype analysis of 63 wheat accessions from eight countries based on SNPs in EST sequences, simple sequence repeats, and sequence tagged sites in the Fhb 1 region identified four major groups: (1) US-Clark, (2) Asian, (3) US-Ernie, and (4) Chinese Spring. The Asian group consisted of Chinese and Japanese accessions that carry Fhb 1 and could be differentiated from other groups by marker Xsnp 3 BS- 11. All Sumai 3 -related accessions formed a subgroup within the Asian group and could be sorted out by Xsnp 3 BS- 8. The SNP markers identified in this study should be useful for MAS of Fhb 1 and fine mapping to facilitate cloning of the Fhb 1 resistance gene...|$|R
40|$|The Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing {{technique}} has found wide acceptance for {{the generation of}} DNA-methylation maps with <b>single-base</b> resolution. The <b>method</b> {{is based on the}} selective deamination of cytosine to uracil (and subsequent conversion to thymine via PCR), whereas 5 -methylcytosine residues remain unchanged. Methylation maps are created by the comparison of bisulfite converted sequences with the untreated genomic sequence. ‘MethTools’ is a collection of software tools that replaces the time-consuming manual comparison process, generates graphical outputs of methylation patterns and methylation density, estimates the systematic error of the experiment and searches for conserved methylated nucleotide patterns. The programs are written in Perl  5 and C, and the source code can be downloaded. All tools run independently but the programs are interfaced. Thus, a script can perform the entire analysis procedure automatically. In addition, a web-based remote analysis service is offered. Both the source code and the remote analysis are available at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a multi-systemic {{vasculitis}} with {{coronary artery}} involvement. Serum interleukin (IL) - 6 levels during acute phase {{showed a significant}} correlation with the duration of fever in patients with KD who were not treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), suggesting that the regulation of IL- 6 expression in KD patients may differ from that in normal children. However, there are controversies surrounding the association between IL- 6 (- 636 C/G) gene polymorphism and development of KD. Subjects and Methods: One hundred and nine children with KD and 191 children with congenital heart disease were included in this study. Echocardiography was performed to examine cardiac involvement in patients with KD. Genotyping of the IL- 6 (- 636 C/G) gene polymorphism was performed using the <b>single-base</b> extension <b>method,</b> and serum IL- 6 concentrations were estimated using the sandwich enzyme immunoassay method. Results: Neutrophil, platelet count, liver function test, total protein and albumin concentrations were significantly different in the KD group and the serum IL- 6 concentration was significantly higher in the KD group than the control group. There {{was no difference between}} the patients with coronary arterial dilatation (CAD) and those without CAD in the IL- 6 (- 636 C/G) polymorphism. The serum albumin concentration was significantly lower in patients with KD who had the- 636 C/G or GG genotype compared with the control group. The serum IL- 6 concentration was significantly higher in patients with KD who had the- 636 C/G or GG genotype. Conclusion: There was no association between the IL- 6 (- 636 C/G...|$|R
40|$|Bisulfite genomic {{sequencing}} is {{the method}} of choice for the generation of methylation maps with <b>single-base</b> resolution. The <b>method</b> {{is based on the}} selective deamination of cytosine to uracil by treatment with bisulfite and the sequencing of subsequently generated PCR products. In contrast to cytosine, 5 -methylcytosine does not react with bisulfite and can therefore be distinguished. In order to investigate the potential for optimization of the method and to determine the critical experimental parameters, we determined the influence of incubation time and incubation temperature on the deamination efficiency and measured the degree of DNA degradation during the bisulfite treatment. We found that maximum conversion rates of cytosine occurred at 55 °C (4 – 18 h) and 95 °C (1 h). Under these conditions at least 84 – 96 % of the DNA is degraded. To study the impact of primer selection, homologous DNA templates were constructed possessing cytosine-containing and cytosine-free primer binding sites, respectively. The recognition rates for cytosine (≥ 97 %) and 5 -methylcytosine (≥ 94 %) were found to be identical for both templates...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objective}} The thromboxane A 2 receptor (TBXA 2 R) is a receptor for a potent bronchoconstrictor, TBXA 2 {{which is known}} to be related to bronchial asthma and myocardial infarction. TBXA 2 R antagonist and TBX synthase inhibitors {{have been found to be}} effective in the management of asthmatic patients. This study was aimed to evaluate whether genetic variants of TBXA 2 R may be related with development of acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) -intolerant asthma (AIA). Methods TBXA 2 R gene polymorphisms (TBXA 2 R+ 795 T>C, TBXA 2 R+ 924 T>C) were determined using a <b>single-base</b> extension <b>method</b> in 93 AIA patients compared with 172 patients with ASA-tolerant asthma (ATA) and 118 normal controls (NCs) recruited from the Korean population. HLA DPB 1 * 0301 genotype was performed using a direct sequencing method. Results The rare C allele frequency of TBXA 2 R+ 795 T>C was significantly higher in AIA than in ATA (P= 0. 03) and the TBXA 2 R+ 795 T>C polymorphism was also associated with extent of percent fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) after the inhalation of lysine–acetyl salicylic acid in AIA patients (P= 0. 009); AIA patients homozygous for the + 795 C allele had a greater percent fall of FEV 1 compared with individuals with TBXA 2 R+ 795 CT or TT genotypes. The frequency of patients carrying both the TBXA 2 R+ 795 T>C rare allele and HLA DPB 1 * 0301 was significantly higher in AIA patients (29. 4 %) than in ATA patients (7. 3 %) (P= 0. 008, odds ratio= 5. 3). Conclusion These results suggest that the polymorphism of TBXA 2 R+ 795 T>C may increase bronchoconstrictive response to ASA, which could contribute to the development of the AIA phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Denaturing {{gradient}} {{gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) {{can be used}} to distinguish two DNA molecules that differ by as little as a <b>single-base</b> substitution. This <b>method</b> detects approximately 50 % of all possible single-base changes in DNA fragments ranging from 50 to approximately 1000 base pairs. To increase the number of single-base changes that can be distinguished by DGGE, we used the polymerase chain reaction to attach a 40 -base-pair G + C-rich sequence, designated a GC-clamp, to one end of amplified DNA fragments that encompass regions of the mouse and human beta-globin genes. We show that this GC-clamp allows the detection of mutations, including the hemoglobin sickle (HbS) and hemoglobin C (HbC) mutations within the human beta-globin gene, that were previously indistinguishable by DGGE. In addition to providing an easy way to attach a GC-clamp to genomic DNA fragments, the polymerase chain reaction technique greatly increases the sensitivity of DGGE. With this approach, DNA fragments derived from less than 5 ng of human genomic DNA can be detected by ethidium bromide staining of the gel, obviating the need for radioactive probes. These improvements extend the applicability of DGGE for the detection of polymorphisms and mutations in genomic and cloned DNA...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} distribution of SNPs and haplotypes in the ABCB 1, SLCO 1 B 1 and SLCO 1 B 3 genes varies largely among continental populations. This variation {{can lead to}} biases in pharmacogenetic studies conducted in admixed populations such as those from Brazil and other Latin American countries. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of self-reported colour, geographical origin and genomic ancestry on distributions of the ABCB 1, SLCO 1 B 1 and SLCO 1 B 3 polymorphisms and derived haplotypes in admixed Brazilian populations. A total of 1039 healthy adults from the north, north-east, south-east and south of Brazil were recruited for this investigation. The c. 388 A>G (rs 2306283), c. 463 C>A (rs 11045819) and c. 521 T>C (rs 4149056) SNPs in the SLCO 1 B 1 gene and c. 334 T>G (rs 4149117) and c. 699 G>A (rs 7311358) SNPs in the SLCO 1 B 3 gene were determined by Taqman 5 '-nuclease assays. The ABCB 1 c. 1236 C>T (rs 1128503), c. 2677 G>T/A (rs 2032582) and c. 3435 C>T (rs 1045642) polymorphisms were genotyped using a previously described <b>single-base</b> extension/termination <b>method.</b> The results showed that genotype and haplotype distributions are highly variable among populations of the same self-reported colour and geographical region. However, genomic ancestry showed that these associations are better explained by a continuous variable. The influence of ancestry on the distribution of alleles and haplotype frequencies was more evident in variants with large differences in allele frequencies between European and African populations. Design and interpretation of pharmacogenetic studies using these transporter genes should include genomic controls to avoid spurious conclusions based on improper matching of study cohorts from Brazilian populations and other highly admixed populations.

Here, we investigated the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms in PCSK 9 and stroke in 237 patients with lacunar infarction in the Uygur and Han populations in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China. Using the SNaPshot <b>single-base</b> terminal extension <b>method,</b> four PCSK 9 gene polymorphisms were analyzed. We found a significantly strong relationship between the PCSK 9 rs 17111503 (G > A) polymorphism and increased susceptibility to lacunar infarction by variant homozygote comparison, and using the dominant and recessive models in the Han population {{but not in the}} Uygur population. Low triglyceride levels were found in AA carriers (rs 17111503, G > A) in the Han population but not in the Uygur population. Association analysis revealed that the rs 17111503 (G > A) polymorphism was not significantly associated with smoking, alcohol drinking, history of hypertension or diabetes in the Han or Uygur lacunar infarction patients. rs 11583680, rs 483462 and rs 505151 were not associated with risk of lacunar infarction in the Han or Uygur populations.

40|$|The {{cultivated}} peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an al¬lotetraploid {{of recent}} origin, with an AABB genome and low genetic diversity. Perhaps {{because of its}} limited genetic diversity, this spe¬cies lacks resistance {{to a number of}} important pests and diseases. In contrast, wild species of Arachis are genetically diverse and are rich sources of disease resistance genes. Consequently, a study of wild peanut relatives is attractive from two points of view: to help un¬derstand peanut genetics and to characterize wild alleles that could confer disease resistance. With this in mind, a diploid population from a cross between two wild peanut relatives was developed, {{in order to make a}} dense genetic map that could serve as a reference for pea-nut genetics and in order to characterize the regions of the Arachis genome that code for disease resistance. We tested two methods for developing and genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms in can¬didate genes for disease resistance; one is based on <b>single-base</b> primer extension <b>methods</b> and the other is based on amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction. We found single-base pair extension to be an efficient method, suitable for high-throughput, single-nucleotide polymorphism mapping; it allowed us to locate five candidate genes for resistance on our genetic map...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The avian disease {{system in}} Hawaii offers an ideal {{opportunity}} to investigate host-pathogen interactions {{in a natural}} setting. Previous studies have recognized only a single mitochondrial lineage of avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum) in the Hawaiian Islands, but cloning and sequencing of nuclear genes suggest {{a higher degree of}} genetic diversity. Methods In order to evaluate genetic diversity of P. relictum at the population level and further understand host-parasite interactions, a modified <b>single-base</b> extension (SBE) <b>method</b> was used to explore spatial and temporal distribution patterns of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (trap) gene of P. relictum infections from 121 hatch-year amakihi (Hemignathus virens) {{on the east side of}} Hawaii Island. Results Rare alleles and mixed infections were documented at three of eight SNP loci; this is the first documentation of genetically diverse infections of P. relictum at the population level in Hawaii. Logistic regression revealed that the likelihood of infection with a rare allele increased at low-elevation, but decreased as mosquito capture rates increased. The inverse relationship between vector capture rates and probability of infection with a rare allele is unexpected given current theories of epidemiology developed in human malarias. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that pathogen diversity in Hawaii may be driven by a complex interaction of factors including transmission rates, host immune pressures, and parasite-parasite competition. </p...|$|R
