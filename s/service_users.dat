5|$|NextWorth is an {{electronics}} trade-in and recycling <b>service.</b> <b>Users</b> {{of the service}} exchange used electronics for cash or discounts on newer models. NextWorth was founded by business students at Babson College in 2005. It started as a commission-based service to help businesses setup online auctions for their used items, then changed its business model to focus on electronics trade-ins in 2006. As of late 2012, NextWorth {{was one of the}} best-known and largest electronics trade-in and recycling services in the United States, although it handles {{only a small percentage of}} total trade-in traffic.|$|E
5|$|The {{television}} industry in Croatia is {{regulated by the}} Croatian Regulatory Authority for Network Industries (HAKOM). HAKOM was established by the Electronic Communications Act of 26 June 2008; pursuant to Article 5 of the act, HAKOM is tasked with promoting and safeguarding market competition {{and the interests of}} <b>service</b> <b>users</b> in the field of electronic communication services and infrastructure, while contributing {{to the development of the}} internal market of the European Union. HAKOM's goals include ensuring sustainable development of the electronic communications market at affordable prices for consumers, providing fair conditions for return on investment in the market and contributing to the quality of life in Croatia. Further regulation of the television is performed by the Electronic Media Council, which enacts mandatory regulation applying to both state-run and privately owned broadcasters based in Croatia. One such regulation, aimed at protection of minors, restricts depictions of violence, sexual intercourse, profanity, use of intoxicating substances and tobacco and other scenes which may be harmful to development of minors between seven in the morning and nine, ten or eleven in the evening, depending on rating of specific programmeadvising that the programme is not suitable for persons under 12, 15 or 18 years of age respectively. The restriction does not apply to educational, documentary, science or news programming.|$|E

25|$|In general, it is {{the psychosocial}} model rather than, or in {{addition}} to, the dominant medical model, that is the underlying rationale for mental health social work.

25|$|One {{approach}} to recovery {{known as the}} Tidal Model focuses on the continuous process of change inherent in all people, conveying the meaning of experiences through water metaphors. Crisis is seen as involving opportunity; creativity is valued; and different domains are explored such as sense of security, personal narrative and relationships. Initially developed by mental health nurses along with <b>service</b> <b>users,</b> Tidal is a particular model that has been specifically researched. Based on a discrete set of values (the Ten Commitments), it {{emphasizes the importance of}} each person's own voice, resourcefulness and wisdom. Since 1999, projects based on the Tidal Model have been established in several countries.|$|E
500|$|Several {{documents}} were submitted late or in suspicious circumstances to the inquiry. A {{report by the}} SSI was submitted late because the SSI presumed the document was not relevant to the inquiry. The report was produced in April 2001 but was not {{handed over to the}} inquiry until 2002. An earlier report by the Joint Review about Haringey social services, which was heavily relied upon during the inquiry, said that <b>service</b> <b>users</b> were [...] "generally well served"; the SSI report said that the former report presented [...] "an overly positive picture of Haringey's social services, particularly children's services". Further {{documents were}} received late, when Haringey council handed in 71 case documents five months after the hearings began. Laming said, [...] "it shows a blatant and flagrant disregard to the work of this inquiry". The people involved were threatened with disciplinary action. This {{was not the first time}} that Haringey council did not produce documents on time, which led Laming to say to its chief executive, [...] "it is a long sad and sorry saga of missed dates and missed timetables". Garnham warned that Haringey senior managers, who had access to the documents, would enjoy an unfair advantage in the inquiry, but Laming said he was [...] "determined that Haringey is not given any advantage". The inquiry found contradictory information in the NSPCC's files. One file said that Climbié's case was [...] "accepted for ongoing service", whilst another computer record, made after Climbié's death, said that [...] "no further action" [...] was to be taken, suggesting the possibility that records may have been changed. Documents given to the inquiry may also have been altered: the NSPCC provided photocopies of original documents, which had alterations in them, saying that the originals were lost; however, the originals were later produced with pressure from the inquiry. The NSPCC held an internal investigation but found no evidence of deception.|$|E

In doing so, the article provides a multifaceted analysis of how <b>service</b> <b>user</b> participation in setting the goals of supervision intersects with factors that could engender compliance. It identifies these factors as: <b>service</b> <b>user</b> agency; positive self-identity; empowerment; self-efficacy; and responsive services.

40|$|This PhD by Public Works {{demonstrates}} how three key topic areas with convergent themes {{emerge from a}} systematic analysis of 21 submitted public works. These are: The personalisation policy agenda in adult social care and mental health; <b>Service</b> <b>user</b> participation; and LGB (T) <b>service</b> <b>user</b> experience. The final synthesis brings together these three topics and core themes as a coherent critique of how the personalisation policy has been constructed and implemented. It examines {{the way in which}} this reflects some of the broader political, operational and systemic barriers to <b>service</b> <b>user</b> participation, the use of experiential knowledge and evidence and the recognition of the full diversity and complexity of people who use mental health and social care services (with particular reference to LGB (T) <b>service</b> <b>user</b> experience). The resultant exploration and argument is informed by my <b>service</b> <b>user</b> perspective and associated methodologies. This context statement shows how the knowledge for the PhD by Public Works was produced, how it makes a significant contribution to knowledge in the field and to the broader sphere of social care and mental health research methodology and <b>service</b> <b>user</b> epistemology...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to build a {{theoretical}} model of how and what clinical psychologists learn from <b>service</b> <b>user</b> and carer involvement in their training. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative research design was adopted, and verbatim transcripts of semi-structured interviews conducted with 12 clinical psychologists were analysed using grounded theory methodology. Findings – Findings indicated that clinical psychologists learned from <b>service</b> <b>user</b> and carer involvement in a variety of ways and a preliminary model was proposed, encompassing four main categories: “mechanisms of learning”, “relational and contextual factors facilitating learning”, “relational and contextual factors hindering learning” and “impact”. Research limitations/implications – Further research is required to establish to what extent the current findings may be transferrable to learning from <b>service</b> <b>user</b> and carer involvement in the context of educating professionals from other disciplines. Additionally, participants had limited experiences of carer involvement, and more research in this area specifically would be useful. Practical implications – This study advocates for <b>service</b> <b>user</b> and carer involvement in clinical psychology training, and specific recommendations are discussed, including <b>service</b> <b>user</b> perspectives. Originality/value – <b>Service</b> <b>user</b> and carer involvement has become mandatory in Health Care Professional Council-approved training programmes for mental health professionals, yet if and how learning occurs is poorly understood in this context. This study makes an important contribution in evaluating outcomes of <b>service</b> <b>user</b> and carer involvement in clinical psychology training by advancing theoretical understanding of the learning processes involved.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on longstanding {{involvement}} {{in the mental health}} care system and highlights limitations of the systems of user involvement that obtained from the 1980 s to the present day. Since the invention of the <b>service</b> <b>user</b> as a medico-political category, <b>service</b> <b>user</b> involvement has been advocated by policymakers and researchers as a way of empowering clients and ensuring service responsiveness and accountability in mental health care in the UK. However, our experience of involvement in this field {{over the past three decades}} suggests that these initiatives may have limited emancipatory impact. Service providers may be adept at ensuring that only certain kinds of <b>service</b> <b>user</b> voices are legitimated and heard, and more critical transgressive voices are sidelined. Moreover, <b>service</b> <b>user</b> involvement has implications which are seldom appreciated, such as the opportunities for patronage, co-optation of tame users and nepotism within the <b>service</b> <b>user</b> organisations themselves. The experiences we relate here suggest that as presently constituted, <b>service</b> <b>user</b> involvement and empowerment does not necessarily make users powerful. Indeed, without a careful reconsideration of the present arrangements for <b>service</b> <b>user</b> representation, it may well consolidate notions of passivity, medical models of human distress and deflect the liberatory potential of transgression. The implicit and sometimes explicit stipulations of what it means to be a ‘good patient’ attenuate the potential for meaningful change and obscure the exercise of power within the mental health system...|$|R

50|$|Despite {{the high}} rates of {{physical}} health problems, mental health <b>service</b> <b>users</b> report that health care workers overlook their physical health needs. <b>Service</b> <b>users</b> would like mental health practitioners to do more for their physical health. Rethink interviewed 2,998 mental health <b>service</b> <b>users,</b> over half of whom lived with a diagnosed severe mental illness. Nearly one third said regular physical health checks were in their top three priorities for improving services. Mental health practitioners may feel unable to provide physical health input.
