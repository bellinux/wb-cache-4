40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop the Quality Index Method (QIM) for <b>skinned</b> <b>fillets</b> from farmed Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and apply it in the establishment of its shelf life. The <b>skinned</b> <b>fillets</b> (120 g in average) were kept in boxes with ice in the proportion of 1 : 1 (fillet:ice) under average temperature of 0 °C and stored at refrigeration chamber (4 °C) during 18 days. To evaluate the freshness during storage time sensory analysis (QIM) and physicochemical (pH and TVB-N) were performed every 72 hours from time zero, in triplicate. The maximum life of the Nile tilapia fillet in ice was estimated at 15 days. The MIQ was considered effective in evaluating the freshness of the Nile tilapia, since the sensory rejection by MIQ was determinant in the shelf life establishment. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi desenvolver o Método do Índice de Qualidade (MIQ) para filé sem pele de tilápia do Nilo (Oreochromis niloticus), cultivada, e aplicá-lo no estabelecimento da sua vida útil. Os filés (média de 120 g cada) foram mantidos em caixas com gelo na proporção de 1 : 1 (filé:gelo) na temperatura média de 0 °C e armazenados em câmaras de refrigeração (4 °C) por 18 dias. Para avaliar o frescor durante o armazenamento, realizaram-se análises sensoriais (MIQ) e físico-químicas (pH e Nitrogênio das Bases Voláteis Totais) a cada 72 horas, a partir do tempo zero, em triplicata. A vida útil máxima do filé sem pele de tilápia do Nilo, em gelo, foi estimada em 15 dias. O MIQ foi considerado eficiente na avaliação do frescor da tilápia do Nilo, já que a rejeição sensorial pelo MIQ foi determinante no estabelecimento da vida de prateleira...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the impact pike fishing season (before spawning in fall (group A) and after spawning in spring (group B)) had on the slaughter yield and fillet fatty acid profile. The slaughter yield of fillets with skin and <b>skinned</b> <b>fillets</b> from the group B fish was significantly lower (by approximately 7. 5 % of body weight). The fatty acid profile of the fish meat from the groups examined differed significantly. The fillets of pike caught before spawning were dominated by unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), while those from fish caught after spawning had mainly saturated fatty acids (SFA). The share of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the fillets of fish that had spawned was sixfold lower, and the n- 3 PUFA differences were nearly ninefold. The content of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) fatty acids in fillets of fish that had spawned was ninefold lower than in those that had not yet done so. Consequently, the ratio of n- 3 PUFA/n- 6 PUFA in pike from group A was over three times higher than that in the fish that had spawned (2. 61 vs 0. 82). Fillets from pike that have spawned are a significantly poorer source of valuable fatty acids for consumers...|$|E

This study gives a comprehensive overview of muscle flesh composition of farmed and wild Atlantic turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) and barramundi (Lates calcarifer) and of farmed pangasius (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus). The proximate composition, di- and triphosphates and citric acid values are presented in order to evaluate possible indicators for a hidden treatment during processing to fillets. All moisture contents were ≤ 80 %. Even for pangasius, protein values for deep <b>skinned</b> <b>fillets</b> of ≥ 18 % were determined. Only small quantities of naturally occurring citric acid (up to 0. 03 g·kg− 1) were detectable. The lipid content was the most varying main component within the different species, ranging between 1. 2 % to 2. 0 % and 0. 3 % to 3. 0 % for farmed turbot and barramundi, respectively. Pangasius flesh had a mean lipid content of 7. 8 %. Trimming and separation of the red layer reduced the lipid content of the commercially sold white-flesh fillets to 2. 7 % to 3. 5 %. Fatty acids profiles, free amino acids, and minerals were analysed to show the nutritional quality of the aquaculture fish species and compared to wild turbot and barramundi.

40|$|High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) can be {{used for}} the {{localized}} heating of biological tissue through the conversion of sound waves into heat. Although originally developed for human medicine, HIFU may also be used to weaken the attachment of pin bones in fish fillets to enable easier removal of such bones. This was shown in the present study, where a series of experiments were performed on HIFU phantoms and fillets of cod and salmon. In thin objects such as fish fillets, the heat is mainly dissipated at the surfaces. However, bones inside the fillet absorb ultrasound energy more efficiently than the surrounding tissue, resulting in a “self-focusing” heating of the bones. Salmon skin was found to effectively block the ultrasound, resulting in a significantly lower heating effect in fillets with skin. Cod skin partly blocked the ultrasound, but only to a small degree, enabling HIFU treatment through the skin. The treatment of fillets to reduce the pin bone attachment yielded an average reduction in the required pulling force by 50 % in cod fillets with skin, with little muscle denaturation, and 72 % in <b>skinned</b> <b>fillets,</b> with significant muscle denaturation. Salmon fillets were treated from the muscle side of the fillet to circumvent the need for penetration through skin. The treatment resulted in a 30 % reduction in the peak pulling force and 10 % reduction in the total pulling work, with a slight denaturation of the fillet surface...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of {{storage and processing}} {{on the development of}} lipid oxidation in herring fillets was investigated and related to their composition of lipids, catalysts and antioxidants. The progress of oxidation was monitored as antioxidant loss and as the development of primary, secondary and tertiary lipid oxidation products. To reduce the toxicity of the lipid extractions, the traditional chloroform/methanol /water system was compared with three alternative alkane/alcohol/water-based systems. The main point of difference was the phospholipid (PL) yields obtained, which became significantly lower with alkane/alcohol/water. However, it became possible to use the system comprising heptane/ethanol/sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) /water by decreasing the SDS-concentration. This modification increased the PL yields to same levels as with chloroform/methanol/water. Ice storage of skin-on herring fillets for up to 15 days gave significant changes in both oxidation products and antioxidants within 2 - 3 days, which yielded "rancid odour" after only 2. 5 days. No significant rise in total bacteria was seen until after 7 days. Comparison of different horizontal layers of the fillets showed that the under skin layer oxidised significantly faster than the middle and inner parts, which was supported by its much higher aqueous pro-oxidative activity. Keeping the herring fillets on ice for more than 3 days significantly increased the oxidation rate during subsequent frozen storage. Among the fillets kept for 0, 3, 6 and 9 days on ice, oxidation products were observed to form most rapidly in the 6 -day fillets. Large differences were found in the oxidation rates {{in different parts of the}} fillets during frozen storage, which were ascribed to differences in composition and in oxygen access. When dark muscle, light muscle and skin were stored separately from each other, the three tissues oxidised according to: dark muscle>skin >light muscle, which was the same ranking order as was found for levels of iron, copper and aqueous pro-oxidative activity. However, when the tissues were stored as an intact fillet, the oxidation order changed to: skin>dark muscle>light muscle, indicating that the skin and light muscle protected the dark muscle e. g. from oxygen. The skin also significantly suppressed oxidation in the under skin layer of the fillet, and, to some extent, also in the middle part. However, in both skin-on and <b>skinned</b> <b>fillets,</b> the under skin layer oxidised significantly faster than the inner and middle parts. An unexpected finding was that mincing the fillets improved the oxidative stability at - 18 °C. In comparison with intact <b>skinned</b> <b>fillets,</b> the oxidation rate in the outer 4 mm of the herring mince samples was 3 - 4. 8 times lower, and in the centre of the samples, 20 - 25 times lower. Washing the mince, which reduced the levels of total fat, neutral lipids iron, copper, selenium, glutathione peroxidase activity and aqueous pro-oxidative activity, decreased the storage stability. Antioxidative properties of the washing water residue revealed that more antioxidants than catalysts were washed out. Washing also appeared to induce lipolysis. Pre-cooking of the mince samples at 55 °C diminished oxidation, most likely due to inactivation of catalytic enzymes. The opposite was found after pre-cooking at 100 °C, which was ascribed to haemoprotein denaturation. At both 55 and 100 °C, rised cooking time from 38 to 54 min negatively affected the stability. Washing prior to the pre-cooking diminished the beneficial effects of mild heating...|$|E

Skeletal damage {{may be caused by}} long term exposure to cadmium (Jarup 2003). Results indicate that the highest accretion of cadmium (0.041  mg kg− 1) is found in the heart of T. blochii. Previous studies have reported that in different fish species (Table 2), Cd was (0.024 – 0.035  mg kg− 1) in Keti Bunder Thatta, (0.076  mg kg− 1) in Baluchistan coast (Tabinda et al. 2010) and (0.320  mg kg− 1) in the Arabian Sea (Tariq et al. 1994).

Fish (mean initial weight of 19. 88 g) were distributed into triplicate treatments at a rate of 25 fish per 200 L tanks and fed to satiation with the experimental diets three times a day. The results of the present study show that the coloration of experimental fish was not modified negatively by the use of DDGS protein sources in diets. Carcass composition values were also not affected by increased DDGS, although some fatty acids were affected. Total saturated fatty acids, total monounsaturated fatty acids, total n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Σn- 3 PUFA) and Σn- 3 PUFA/total n- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Σn- 6 PUFA) values of the fish in the experimental groups were found to be statistically similar.

40|$|Trachurus trachurus (locally called kote) is a {{table fish}} {{that has become}} {{increasingly}} important in the Nigerian diet because of its low price. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of proc-essed kote on the activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in selected tissues of weaned male albino rats using standard methods. Chemical analyses were carried out on processed <b>fillet,</b> <b>skin,</b> head & bone (SHB) diets under standard conditions. 40 male rats (40. 76 ± 2. 42 g) were fed with processed fillet or SHB di-ets for 14 days to assay for the activities of ALP in harvested samples of brain, liver, kidney, heart, stomach, small intestine and spleen; ALT and AST in the liver and heart. All data were subjected to analysis of variance by Duncan’s multiple range test and considered significant at a minimum of p < 0. 05. Levels of ALP & AST in the liver, heart, kidney and brain were reduced (p < 0. 05) in rats fe...|$|R
40|$|Body {{composition}} {{analysis is}} relevant to characterize the nutritional requirements and finishing phase of fish. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between ichthyometric (weight, total and standard length, density and yields), bromatological (fat, protein, ash and water content) and bioelectrical-impedance-analysis (BIA) (resistance, reactance, phase angle and composition indexes) variables in the hybrid tambatinga (Colossoma macropomum × Piaractus brachypomus). In a non-fertilized vivarium, 520 juveniles were housed and fed commercial rations. Then, 136 days after hatching (DAH), 15 fish with an average weight of 37. 69 g and average total length of 12. 96 cm were randomly chosen, anesthetized (eugenol) and subjected to the first of fourteen fortnightly assessments (BIA and biometry). After euthanasia, the following parts were weighed: whole carcass with the head, <b>fillet,</b> and <b>skin</b> (WC); <b>fillet</b> with <b>skin</b> (FS); and the remainder of the carcass with the head (CH). Together, FS and CH were ground and homogenized for the bromatological analyses. Estimates of the body composition and yields of tambatinga, with models including ichthyometric and BIA variables, showed correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 81 (for the FS yield) to 1, 00 (for the total ash). Similarly, models that included only BIA variables had correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 81 (FS and CH yields) to 0. 98 (for the total ash). Therefore, in tambatinga, the BIA technique allows the estimation of the yield of the <b>fillet</b> with <b>skin</b> and the body composition (water content, fat, ash, and protein). The best models combine ichthyometric and BIA variables...|$|R
40|$|Reliability of genomic {{selection}} (GS) models {{was tested}} in an admixed population of Atlantic salmon, originating from crossing of several wild subpopulations. The models included ordinary genomic BLUP models (GBLUP), using genome-wide SNP markers of varying densities (1 to 220 k), a genomic identity-by-descent model (IBD-GS), using linkage analysis of sparse genome-wide markers, {{as well as}} a classical pedigree-based model. Reliabilities of the models were compared through 5 -fold cross-validation. The traits studied were salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) resistance (LR), measured as (log) density on the <b>skin</b> and <b>fillet</b> color (FC), with respective estimated heritabilities of 0. 14 and 0. 43. All genomic models outperformed the classical pedigree-based model, for both traits and at all marker densities. However, the relative improvement differed considerably between traits, models and marker densities. For the highly heritable FC, the IBD-GS had similar reliability as GBLUP at high marker densities (> 22 k). In contrast, for the lowly heritable LR, IBD-GS was clearly inferior to GBLUP, irrespective of marker density. Hence, GBLUP was robust to marker density for the lowly heritable LR, but sensitive to marker density for the highly heritable FC. We hypothesize that this phenomenon may be explained by historical admixture of different founder populations, expected to reduce short-range LD and induce long-range LD. The relative importance of LD/relationship information is expected to decrease/increase with increasing heritability of the trait. Still, using the ordinary GBLUP, the typical long-range LD of an admixed population may be effectively captured by sparse markers, while efficient utilization of relationship information may require denser markers (e. g., 22 k or more) ...|$|R
