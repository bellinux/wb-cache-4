5000|$|The Object Relations Inventory (ORI [...] ) is an {{open-ended}} technique {{for the assessment}} of qualitative (thematic) features and the cognitive-structural organization of self and object representations. Spontaneously descriptions of self and significant others (i.e., parents, therapist or close friend) are scored for Conceptual Level (CL, with sensorimotor, concrete-perceptual, external and internal iconic, and conceptual levels, per the above developmental sequence), which is considered a <b>structural</b> <b>variable</b> reflecting degree of psychological organization of significant-figure descriptions, as well as for three content factors (Benevolent, Punitive and Striving). Blatt and colleagues [...] later developed the Differentiation-Relatedness (D-R) Scale, another method for evaluating self and other descriptions that is more experiential and affective than the CL Scale and that takes into account more severe boundary disturbances at its lowest levels and more sophisticated aspects of intersubjectivity at its highest levels. The D-R Scale has been found to measure the therapeutic transition of borderline patients from descriptions of self and significant others that are polarized and exaggerated, with extreme, unmodulated characteristics, whether positive or negative, to descriptions that begin to integrate contradictory aspects of self or others and that therefore indicate the transition into evocative object constancy. [...] In addition, Blatt, Bers, and Schaffer [...] developed six scales for assessing aspects of descriptions of self, including mode of description, sense of relatedness, cognitive variables, view of the self, developmental variables, affective variables, and length. Each category (except length) consists of two to four scales, covering various aspects of the description. Participants are scored on every scale separately, and then a weighted assessment is computed. This measure has found that anorexic patients show many signs of introjective, self-critical organization that are not found in other psychiatric patients ...|$|E

The annual output data from 1973 to 2000 is pooled for the four Pakistani provinces. The cross-sectional specific effects, the time specific effects, the manufacturing output, and the <b>structural</b> <b>variable</b> for aggregate supply or production shocks are used to control the different steady state levels of per capita incomes of thedifferent provinces. The equation for conditional convergence is estimated through generalized least squares (GLS) method, after controlling for the different steady states of the provinces. The result shows that the provinces of Pakistan converge to their own respective steady states with a convergence speed of 11 % per annum. At the same time manufacturing output is also statistically significant and positively affects the {{economic growth in the}} provinces.

40|$|The {{effects of}} social <b>structural</b> <b>variables</b> and of two {{different}} types of alienation -powerlessness and normIessness- over interpersonal attítudes are studied. Foster´s syndrome of the image of the limited good is used as a theoretical base to test the hypothesis that alienation mediates the effects of <b>structural</b> <b>variables</b> on ínterpersonal attitudes. The subjects were 174 peasants, heads of household, from a remote rural district in central Panama. The results show that (a) <b>structural</b> <b>variables</b> have a small direct effect on alienation; (b) that the {{two different types of}} alienation mediate the effects of different structural variables; (e) that both types of alienation have direct effects of a greater magnitude than the combíned effect of the structural variables; and (d) that the more physically isolated the peasant is, and thus the more dependent he is on his neighbors, the more likely he is to have positive attitudes towards them. These results are interpreted as supportive of the hypothesis that alienation mediates the effects of <b>structural</b> <b>variables.</b> However, they also cast some doubts on the contention that scarcíty leads to unfriendly attitudes since none of the economic variables showed significant effects in the regression analyses...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{migration}} decisionmaking {{has been}} {{centered on the}} notion that residential satisfaction and mobility intentions are intervening variables which fully mediate the effects of structural factors on moving behavior. Results from empirical studies, however, have rendered only modest support for this view. The author examines the role of residential satisfaction and mobility intentions vis-�-vis <b>structural</b> <b>variables</b> in migration decisionmaking with the aid of data drawn from the 1985 - 1989 waves of the American Housing Survey. A conceptual model is derived which is based on behavioral theories developed in social psychology, namely the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior. Several previously ignored links among <b>structural</b> <b>variables,</b> mobility predispositions, and moving behavior are incorporated. Empirical analyses show that, although satisfaction and intentions are important predictors of mobility, most of the <b>structural</b> <b>variables</b> that are commonly known to be related to migration also have direct effects on subsequent moving behavior, independent of satisfaction and intentions. The theories of reasoned action and planned behavior provide a theoretical framework for {{a better understanding of the}} complex relationships between <b>structural</b> <b>variables,</b> residential satisfaction, mobility intentions, and behavior. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES. This study {{compared}} the relative {{strength of the}} associations {{of a set of}} structural (social, economic, and political) variables and a set of health services variables with state-level infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality. It also examined whether health services mediate the relationships between <b>structural</b> <b>variables</b> and state-level infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality. METHODS. With the state as the unit of analysis, data for all 50 states were analyzed by means of multiple regression. RESULTS. <b>Structural</b> <b>variables</b> accounted for substantially more variance in infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality than health services variables, and health services variables were more strongly related to infant mortality than to neonatal or postneonatal mortality. When health services variables were controlled, the strengths of the associations between the <b>structural</b> <b>variables</b> and infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality were reduced but remained statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS. A substantial portion of the variance in state-level infant mortality is accounted for by states' structural characteristics, which are partially mediated by health services...|$|R

Since cerrado is usually characterized by its structure, {{it is essential to}} determine which structural parameters are better for its classification and which can best be related to its spectral behavior with remotely sensed data. In fact, satellite data is often the only source of data available with sufficient frequency and coverage to monitor cerrado. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the behavior of reflectance of cerrado regrowth over time and determine which variables better characterize the age of regeneration and if these variable can be estimated from Landsat TM data. Images of the TM/Landsat 5 sensor from a cerrado region were acquired in eleven different dates from 1994 to 2007. Seventeen plots with 16, 17 and 23 years ages of regeneration and non-degraded vegetation were surveyed. SAVI vegetation index, Band 3 and Band 4 were chosen for study the temporal evolution of reflectance by age. The results showed that the relationship between <b>structural</b> <b>variable</b> regrowth age are generally acceptable with 54 to 71 % of explained variation. On the other hand, the relationship between these <b>structural</b> <b>variable</b> and spectral values was weak (24 %) to null.

40|$|AbstractBased on the {{dynamics}} of vitrification process driven by the configurational entropy, a novel expression of viscosity- temperature relation with the form of Fermi-type function is deduced below melting temperature by supposed an exponential function of average aggregation energy with temperature. The ‘molecular rearrangement’ to form aggregated regions at temperatures below the melting temperature is major contribution to the aggregation energies for describing vitrification process. The expression of relaxation time or viscosity is confirmed with several super-cooled liquids in broad temperature region. The expression contains the Vogel-Fulcher relation in limited temperature region and can avoid Kauzmenn paradox.
