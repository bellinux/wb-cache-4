Later that year, Patton married Judi Jane Conway of Pikeville, a secretary at his Kentucky Elkhorn mine. In 1973, Conway had divorced her first husband, Bill Harvey Johnson, {{with whom she had}} two children.|$|E
5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their client had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance for her to have a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion to throw out the new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. The defense argued that the prosecution had illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim <b>saying</b> <b>only</b> the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E

Reflecting Chrétien's poor {{relations with the}} Catholic church, the local priest in Shawinigan, Father Auger, refused to marry Chrétien in his church, <b>saying</b> <b>only</b> bleus (blues i.e. Union Nationale supporters) were welcome in his church and rouges (reds i.e. Liberals) were not.|$|E
25|$|Jung did {{not plan}} to study {{psychiatry}} since it was not considered prestigious at the time. But, studying a psychiatric textbook, he became very excited when he discovered that psychoses are personality diseases. His interest was immediately captured—it combined the biological and the spiritual, {{exactly what he was}} searching for. In 1895 Jung began to study medicine at the University of Basel. Barely a year later in 1896, his father Paul died and left the family near destitute. They were helped out by relatives who also contributed to Jung's studies. During his student days, he entertained his contemporaries with the family legend, that his paternal grandfather was the illegitimate son of Wolfgang Goethe and his German great-grandmother, Sophie Ziegler. In later life, he pulled back from this tale, <b>saying</b> <b>only</b> that Sophie was a friend of Goethe's niece.|$|E

25|$|In 1958, Toole {{graduated}} from Tulane with honors. He enrolled in Columbia University in New York on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship to study English literature. He {{took on a}} heavy workload {{so that he could}} earn his master's degree in a single year. In his free time he dated Ruth Kathmann, another student from Tulane, who was studying journalism at Columbia. The couple would go dancing at the Roseland Ballroom, as the $2.00 entrance fee allowed them to dance all night and suited their limited budget. Toole was noted to be a talented dancer. There is some question as to whether they were engaged, with friends claiming they were but Kathmann <b>saying</b> <b>only</b> that Toole asked her to marry him, but she declined. After he returned to New Orleans they rarely saw each other, and she married another man. Toole wrote his master's essay on the Elizabethan poet John Lyly, which was made easier {{by the fact that he}} had also written his honors thesis at Tulane on Lyly.|$|E
25|$|Edward Perry Warren {{first saw}} Lewes House in 1889 {{and with his}} partner John Marshall they were prodigious {{collectors}} of fine antique sculpture there. Eric Gill was introduced to Warren by Roger Fry and the stone carving Ecstasy purchased, which {{is now in the}} Tate Gallery collection. William Rothenstein suggested that Warren might like to acquire Rodin's new sculpture The Kiss and after several visits, in 1904 the Lewes Kiss arrived at Lewes House. In 1906 Rodin requested that Warren lend The Kiss to an important exhibition in Regent Street, London. This made it famous in Britain for the first time. The Kiss was returned to the stables at Lewes House, where it remained until 1914 until offered to Lewes Town Council. It was placed in the Town Hall, at the South End of the Assembly Room on 2 December 1914. Early in 1915, The Kiss was wrapped in canvas and marked off with a guard rail. The Town Council returned the statue, <b>saying</b> <b>only</b> that the room did 'not lend itself to such a noble piece of statuary.' On 26 February 1917, The Kiss was once more taken to the stable block where it was to remain until Warren's death in 1928. After a short period on loan to Cheltenham, The Kiss was purchased in 1953 by public subscription and {{is now one of the}} Tate's most popular attractions.|$|E
25|$|Eden's major mistake {{had been}} not to strike in July 1956 {{when there was}} {{widespread}} anger at Nasser's nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company, as {{by the fall of}} 1956 public anger had subsided, with many people in Britain having come to accept the fait accompli, and saw no reason for war. This was especially the case as Eden's claims that the Egyptians would hopelessly mismanage the Canal had proven groundless, and that by September 1956 {{it was clear that the}} change of management had not affected shipping. Even more importantly, Eden's obsession with secrecy and his desire to keep the preparations for war as secret as possible meant that the Eden government did nothing in the months running up to the attack to explain to the British people why it was felt that war was necessary. Many of the reservists who were called up for their National Service in the summer and fall of 1956 recalled feeling bewildered and confused as the Eden government started preparing to attack Egypt while at the same time Eden insisted in public that he wanted a peaceful resolution of the dispute, and was opposed to attacking Egypt. The British author David Pryce-Jones recalled that as a young officer, that after the ultimatum was submitted to Egypt he had to explain to his troops why war with Egypt was necessary without believing a word that he was <b>saying.</b> <b>Only</b> one British soldier, however, refused to fight.|$|E

25|$|With Anna in chains, Ingrid asks Anna {{to recall}} {{the tale of a}} king who lost his only daughter, and as a result, used a mirror to cast a spell on his whole kingdom, making them see only the worst qualities in those around them, leading them to kill each other. Ingrid uses a small shard of the mirror to cast the same spell, the Spell of Shattered Sight, on Anna, {{resulting}} in Anna becoming negative and resentful against Elsa for deserting her during their childhood. Elsa suspects a spell has been cast on her sister when Anna comes to the dining room carrying the urn and <b>saying</b> <b>only</b> negative things about her. Ingrid demands that Elsa freeze Anna to prevent her from trapping Elsa inside of the urn; however, Elsa refuses to hurt her sister, crossing her arms to hold in her magic. Still under the spell, Anna traps Elsa inside the urn, even as Elsa tells her that no matter what she does, she will always love her. Anna realizes too late what she has done when Ingrid takes the urn from her, and Kristoff arrives to stop Ingrid. Unfortunately, Elsa's entrapment was not Ingrid's original plan, and in her anger, she uses her powers to freeze Anna, Kristoff, and the entire Kingdom of Arendelle. Rumplestiltskin appears in the dining room, finding Ingrid practicing her Rock Troll magic, pulling memories from Elsa, still inside the urn, over to a rock in her other hand. Rumplestiltskin asks her to give him the Sorcerer's Hat box; when she refuses, he magically takes and hides the urn and Anna's necklace, saying he will return them only in exchange for the box.|$|E
500|$|Preparations for {{the tour}} began as early as 1986, when Bowie warned his band to [...] "be ready for next year."

[...] He began a {{publicity}} campaign to put his company and himself in a better light. Though he had long maintained a policy of active silence with the press, he decided to make himself more accessible and responded with conciliatory comments such as [...] "capital and labor are both wild forces which require intelligent legislation to hold them in restriction." [...] He wrote and published his memoirs beginning in 1908. Critics found his writing to be sanitized and disingenuous and thought that statements such as [...] "the underlying, essential element of success in business is to follow the established laws of high-class dealing" [...] seemed to {{be at odds with}} his true business methods.|$|E

500|$|The script {{comments}} cheekily on the Beatles' fame. For instance, at {{one point}} a fan, played by Anna Quayle, apparently recognises John Lennon, though she does not actually mention Lennon's name, <b>saying</b> <b>only</b> [...] "you are...". He demurs, saying his face is not quite right for [...] "him", initiating a surreal dialogue ending with the fan agreeing that Lennon doesn't [...] "look like him at all", and Lennon saying to himself that [...] "she looks more like him than I do". Other dialogue is derived from actual interviews with the Beatles. When Ringo is asked if he's a mod or a rocker, he replies: [...] "Uh, no, I'm a mocker", a line derived from a joke he made on the TV show Ready Steady Go!. The frequent reference to McCartney's grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell) as a [...] "clean old man" [...] sets up a contrast with the stock description of Brambell's character, Albert Steptoe in Steptoe and Son, as a [...] "dirty old man".|$|E
500|$|Munsey {{had won the}} enmity of many journalists {{with his}} buying, selling and {{consolidation}} of newspapers, and the Herald became part of Munsey's moves. [...] The publisher merged the morning Sun (which he had purchased in 1916) into the Herald and attempted to revive the newspaper through his financial resources, hoping to establish the Herald as the pre-eminent Republican newspaper within the city. [...] To achieve that end, he approached Elisabeth Mills Reid in early 1924 with a proposal to purchase the Tribune—the only other Republican newspaper in New York—and merge it with the Herald. [...] The elder Reid refused to sell, <b>saying</b> <b>only</b> that she would buy the Herald. [...] The two sides negotiated through the winter and spring. [...] Munsey approached Ogden Reid with a proposal to swap the profitable evening Sun with the Tribune, which Reid refused. [...] The Reids countered with an offer of $5 million for the Herald and the Paris Herald, which Munsey agreed to on March 17, 1924.|$|E
500|$|Rhodes {{and other}} British figures often contended {{that there were}} more uitlanders in the Transvaal than Boers. Kruger's {{administration}} recorded twice as many Transvaalers as uitlanders, but acknowledged {{that there were more}} uitlanders than enfranchised burghers. According to the British Liberal politician James Bryce, most uitlanders saw the country as [...] "virtually English" [...] and perceived [...] "something unreasonable or even grotesque in the control of a small body of persons whom they deemed in every way their inferiors." [...] On 4 March 1890, when Kruger visited Johannesburg, men sang British patriotic songs, tore down and trampled on the vierkleur at the city landdrost's office, and rioted outside the house where the President was staying. One of the agitators accused him of treating the uitlanders with contempt; Kruger retorted: [...] "I have no contempt for the new population, only for people like yourself." [...] The riot was broken up by police and the Chamber of Mines issued an apology, which Kruger accepted, <b>saying</b> <b>only</b> a few of the uitlanders had taken part. Few Boers were as conciliatory as Kruger; Meintjes marks this as [...] "the point where the rift between the Transvaalers and the uitlanders began." ...|$|E

500|$|Hughes {{met with}} several other Rhodesian figures before leaving late on 27 July, but Lisbon {{remained}} off the programme most of the time. Just before Hughes departed, Dupont released {{a statement saying that}} Reedman would take office in Lisbon on 1 August, and would be [...] "warmly welcomed" [...] by the Portuguese government. Hughes decried this in a brief telephone call to Smith, but could do little more before leaving Rhodesia that evening. On 29 July, Smith fielded questions from the press, commenting on both Lisbon and the independence talks in general. He expressed the belief that Rhodesia had made more progress towards independence talking with Hughes than it ever had before, but qualified this by <b>saying</b> <b>only</b> Wilson's reply to the proposals given to Hughes would show if this were indeed true. He said that although he thought Whitehall was keen to resolve the independence issue, he did not believe their line had changed. He declared that he and the RF would not change their stance in any way. Moving to the subject of Lisbon, Smith stressed that this was separate from the independence dispute, then overruled Dupont's announcement of two days before: Reedman's appointment would remain provisional until further notice, he said.|$|E
500|$|Roy, who {{had taught}} Cho in Introduction to Poetry the {{previous}} year, {{described him as}} [...] "an intelligent man," [...] and {{that he seemed to}} be an awkward, lonely and insecure student who never took off his sunglasses, even indoors. She described Cho's behavior as [...] "arrogant" [...] and [...] "obnoxious" [...] at times, and that she tried several different ways to help him. Roy declined to comment on Cho's writings, <b>saying</b> <b>only</b> in general that they [...] "seemed very angry." [...] She added that Cho, when called on in class, would take 20 seconds to answer questions, and whispered his response. He also took cell phone pictures of her in class. After Roy became concerned with Cho's behavior and the themes in his writings, she started meeting with Cho to work with him one-on-one. However, she soon became concerned for her safety, and told her assistant that she would use the name of a dead professor as a duress code, in order to alert the assistant to call security. After Roy notified authorities of Cho's behavior, she urged Cho to seek counseling, but to her knowledge, Cho never followed through with the request, in spite of his insistence to the contrary.|$|E
500|$|Weinman never {{disclosed}} {{the name}} of the model for the obverse, and no person ever claimed to have been her. [...] The winged Liberty is widely believed, however, to have been based on a 1913 bust Weinman sculpted of Elsie Stevens, wife of Wallace Stevens. [...] A lawyer and insurance executive, Wallace Stevens later became famous as a poet; Wallace and Elsie Stevens rented an apartment from Weinman from 1909 to 1916. [...] In a draft of his unpublished autobiography, Woolley wrote that Weinman refused to name the model, but told him it was the wife of a lawyer who lived above his Manhattan apartment (Woolley, in a later version, omitted the location, <b>saying</b> <b>only</b> that Weinman said it was the wife of a lawyer friend). [...] Woolley recorded that he was told that the model wore the top of an old pair of stockings to simulate the cap. [...] In 1966, Holly Stevens, Wallace and Elsie's daughter, noted in her edition of her father's letters that Elsie had been the model for Weinman's dime and half dollar. [...] Liberty's features also bear a resemblance to the face of Victory in Weinman's 1909 statuary group erected in Baltimore, the Union Soldiers and Sailors' Monument.|$|E
