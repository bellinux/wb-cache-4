5|$|All banksias have {{developed}} proteoid or cluster roots {{in response to}} the nutrient poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus). The plant develop masses of fine lateral roots that form a mat-like structure underneath the <b>soil</b> <b>surface,</b> and enable it to extract nutrients as efficiently possible out of the soil. A study of three co-occurring species in banksia woodland in southwestern Australia—Banksia menziesii, B. attenuata and B. ilicifolia—found that all three develop fresh roots in September after winter rainfall, and that the bacteria populations associated with the root systems of B. menziesii differ from the other two, and that they also change depending on the age of the roots.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{diseases}} include wirestem, {{which causes}} weak or dying transplants; Fusarium yellows, which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and blackleg (see Leptosphaeria maculans), {{which leads to}} sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A.brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in affected plants. They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> for up to twelve weeks after harvest. Rhizoctonia solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings ("damping-off"), root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads.|$|E
5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} <b>soil</b> <b>surface,</b> which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E

5|$|Larvae pupate 5 to 10cm {{below the}} <b>soil</b> <b>surface.</b> Pupae are brown in color; they measure 5.5mm wide and 17 to 22mm long. The biggest {{environmental}} factor {{that affects the}} pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily soil temperature. This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality. Another factor that influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal mortality is high in wet soil, where the moisture level is between 18 and 25 percent. Dehydration {{can also lead to}} high death rates among pupae, if soil moisture is as low as 1 to 2 percent.|$|E
5|$|A termite nest can be {{considered}} as being composed of two parts, the inanimate and the animate. The animate is all of the termites living inside the colony, and the inanimate part is the structure itself, which is constructed by the termites. Nests can be broadly separated into three main categories: subterranean (completely below ground), epigeal (protruding above the <b>soil</b> <b>surface),</b> and arboreal (built above ground, but always connected to the ground via shelter tubes). Epigeal nests (mounds) protrude from the earth with ground contact and are made out of earth and mud. A nest has many functions such as providing a protected living space and providing shelter against predators. Most termites construct underground colonies rather than multifunctional nests and mounds. Primitive termites of today nest in wooden structures such as logs, stumps and the dead parts of trees, as did termites millions of years ago.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is {{produced}} in {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen. 10Be accumulates at the <b>soil</b> <b>surface,</b> where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores. The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.|$|E
40|$|Volatilisation {{rates of}} five {{pesticides}} (parathion-methyl, endosulfan, fenpropimorph, lindane, trifluralin) applied in formulations were determined from <b>soil</b> <b>surfaces</b> and French beans. Tests were {{performed in a}} wind tunnel under defined conditions (20 deg C, air velocity 1 m/s., relative air humidity 40 - 60 per cent). Volatilised substances in the air were trapped by passing {{a part of the}} whole air stream of the wind tunnel through polyurethane foam. Toluene extracts of the adsorbent were analyzed by gas chromatography. Volatilisation from <b>soil</b> <b>surfaces</b> within 24 hours increased in the order parathion-methyl = fenpropimorph < endosulfan < lindane < trifluralin. For all compounds volatilisation from French beans was higher as compared to volatilisation from <b>soil</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Volatilisation rates from plant surfaces were 50 - 70 per cent for parathion-methyl, endosulfan, fenpropimorph, and lindane. Trifluralin was nearly completely volatilised within 24 hours. Volatilisation and vapour pre ssure seemed to be correlated for the tested pesticides...|$|R

5|$|The rate of {{movement}} of workers is associated with temperature, and foraging workers leave the nest after sunrise when the nest is warmed in the early morning. Meat ants emerge and start foraging when temperatures are approximately 14°C (57°F), but {{they are capable of}} withstanding extremely hot temperatures, as workers have been seen foraging in 43°C (109°F) heat. Workers may only forage for several minutes when soil temperature is well above their thermal limit at 45.8°C (114°F). At 50°C (122°F) (<b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> temperature), foraging activity is reduced even further. As these ants exhibit high running speeds during hot days, their speed decreases after temperatures of 50°C due to the physiological stress put onto them. Workers can withstand such temperatures by exhibiting opportunistic thermal responses to adjust their behaviour in order to handle high trail temperatures and alter their thermal biology for low temperatures. They will also deliberately expose themselves closely to their thermal maxima.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{communicate}} with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the <b>soil</b> <b>surface</b> to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail {{on the way back to}} the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically in 2010, based on specimens collected in February, 2009 from Benton County, Oregon. Before this, {{it had been}} known locally for several years as the Oregon brown truffle, and assumed to be an undescribed species of Leucangium, based on its overall resemblance to and similar habitat as the Oregon black truffle, Leucangium carthusianum; it was given the provisional name Leucangium brunneum. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences revealed that the species {{is not related to}} the truffle genera of the family Tuberaceae, including Tuber, Dingleya and Reddellomyces. Rather, it has close affinity with the hypogeous (below the <b>soil</b> <b>surface)</b> genera of the Morchellaceae, including Fischerula, Imaia, and Leucangium, but both genetic and morphological characters are sufficiently distinct to warrant designation as a distinct genus. All four hypogeous Morchellaceae genera produce huge spores, with sizes ranging from 32 to 100micrometers (μm). Both Kalapuya and Imaia have asci (spore-bearing cells) that have thick cell walls when young, but become thin when mature—a trait not shared with Fischerula. The authors explain that although the hypogeous Morchellaceae genera share the trait of large spore size, striking differences in spore structure and other morphological difference in microscopic characters would have ruled out placing them in the same family as Morchella, {{were it not for the}} convincing molecular evidence proving their relatedness.|$|E

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study has been}} conducted to test {{the effectiveness of the}} canonical discriminant approach to making spatial discrimination of salt–affected <b>soil</b> <b>surfaces,</b> using the Landsat TM data taken in the middle reaches of the Heihe River, China. A saline area can be considered a mixture of salt–affected patches which differ in degree, and hence we tried to make discrimination of salt–affected <b>soil</b> <b>surfaces</b> by canonical discriminant approach. Three 360 × 360 m test plots with different land surface conditions, “Bare–soil surface area (strongly saline), “Reed area (moderately saline), “Barley field (weakly saline) ”, were selected as training areas or groups. Five indices, B 4 (band 4 DN), Wetness, SI, NDSI, and Fe 2 O 3 (composite indices), were determined as discriminating variables, and two canonical discriminant functions, y 1 and y 2, were obtained for the three groups using these five discriminating variables. When group centroids and individual cases were plotted on the plane made by two canonical discriminant functions, y 1 and y 2, the groups of cases were quite distinct and their centroids were well separated, which suggest that the canonical discriminant approach is promising for spatial discrimination of salt–affected <b>soil</b> <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{climate of}} Central Europe, mainly winter seasons with no snow cover at lower altitudes and a spring drought as well, might cause erosion events on heavy-textured soils. The {{aim of this}} paper is to define a {{universal}} method to identify the potential risk of wind erosion on heavy-textured soils. The categorization of potential wind erosion risk due to meteorological conditions is based on: (i) an evaluation of the number of freeze-thaw episodes forming bare <b>soil</b> <b>surfaces</b> during the cold period of year; and (ii), an evaluation of the number of days with wet <b>soil</b> <b>surfaces</b> during the cold period of year. In the period 2001 – 2012 (from November to March), episodes with temperature changes from positive to negative and vice versa (thaw-freeze and freeze-thaw cycles) and the effects of wet <b>soil</b> <b>surfaces</b> in connection with aggregate disintegration, are identified. The data are spatially interpolated by GIS tools for areas in the Czech Republic with heavy-textured soils. Blending critical categories is used to locate potential risks. The level of risk is divided into six classes.

40|$|Arid and {{semi-arid}} ecosystems of {{the southwestern}} U. S. are experiencing major {{changes that have}} profound impacts for community structure and ecosystem function. First, these ecosystems are experiencing dramatic shifts in vegetation composition {{as a result of}} the invasion of non-native species. Second these ecosystems are predicted to undergo substantial shifts in climate regime, which include increases in the variability and frequency of extreme temperature and precipitation events. It is not well understood how these current and predicted changes will affect the physiological performance of different plant types in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. To address the effect of these changes, this dissertation focused on the photosynthetic response of a native and non-native grass species, and dominant shrub species to precipitation across contrasting <b>soil</b> <b>surfaces</b> in southeastern Arizona. The native and non-native grasses were exposed to wet and dry seasonal precipitation and responses to precipitation events ('pulses') were measured over the course of a summer growing season. To gain a mechanistic understanding of these patterns, the biochemical and diffusion limitations to photosynthetic function were measured over the course of a pulse period. Building on this foundation, natural stands of the non-native grass species were exposed to sequences of different sized pulse events. The physiological performance of a dominant shrub species, Larrea tridentata, was measured in order to determine the biochemical and diffusional constraints to photosynthetic function across seasons and contrasting <b>soil</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The results showed that leaf area development of these grass species affects water availability and time lags in photosynthetic response. Initial soil moisture conditions across contrasting <b>soil</b> <b>surfaces</b> influence the magnitude of photosynthetic response in grasses. Large photosynthetic responses of the non-native grass require large and consecutive precipitation pulses. Co-limitation of photosynthesis of Larrea tridentata by diffusion and biochemistry does not illustrate typical trends across seasons and <b>soil</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Overall results demonstrate the importance of determining the mechanisms responsible for observed leaf-level photosynthetic patterns across individual pulse events, seasons, and contrasting <b>soil</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This is especially important for predicting the magnitude of the response of plant communities in arid and semi-arid ecosystems to species invasions and changes in climate...|$|R
