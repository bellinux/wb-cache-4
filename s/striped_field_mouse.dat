40|$|International audienceHantaviruses (Bunyaviridae) cause {{hemorrhagic fever}} with renal {{syndrome}} (HFRS) in Eurasia and hantavirus (cardio) pulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. HFRS {{is caused by}} Hantaan (HTNV), Seoul (SEOV), Dobrava (DOBV), Saaremaa (SAAV) and Puumala (PUUV) viruses. Of those, only HTNV is not present in Europe. In recent years, hantaviruses, described {{in other parts of}} Europe, were also detected at various locations in Hungary. To study the genetic properties of Hungarian hantaviruses in detail, sequences of the viral S and M segments were recovered from bank voles (Myodes glareolus), yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) and <b>striped</b> <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> (Apodemus agrarius) trapped in the Transdanubian region.

40|$|Abstract Background In rodents, {{the cell}} surface {{complement}} regulatory protein CD 46 is expressed {{solely on the}} spermatozoal acrosome membrane. Ablation of the CD 46 gene {{is associated with a}} faster acrosome reaction. Sperm from Apodemus flavicollis (yellow-necked <b>field</b> <b>mice),</b> A. microps (pygmy <b>field</b> <b>mice)</b> and A. sylvaticus (European wood mice) fail to express CD 46 protein and exhibit a more rapid acrosome reaction rate than Mus (house mice) or BALB/c <b>mice.</b> A. agrarius (<b>striped</b> <b>field</b> <b>mice)</b> belong to a different Apodemus subgenus and have pronounced promiscuity and large relative testis size. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether A. agrarius sperm fail to express CD 46 protein and, if so, whether A. agrarius have a faster acrosome reaction than Mus. Methods Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to assess whether A. agrarius transcribe testicular CD 46 mRNA. RT-PCR was supplemented with 3 '- and 5 '-rapid amplification of cDNA ends to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of A. agrarius CD 46. Fluorescence microscopy was used to assess whether CD 46 protein is expressed by A. agrarius sperm. The acrosome status of A. agrarius sperm was calculated over time by immunocytochemistry using peanut agglutinin lectin. Results We demonstrate that A. agrarius mice transcribe two unique alternatively spliced testicular CD 46 mRNA transcripts, both lacking exon 7, which differ from those described previously in other Apodemus species. The larger A. agrarius CD 46 transcript has an insert between exons 10 and 11 which, if translated, would result in a novel cytoplasmic tail. In addition, A. agrarius CD 46 transcripts have an extended AU-rich 3 '-untranslated region (UTR) and a truncated 5 '-UTR, resulting in failure to express spermatozoal CD 46 protein. We show that A. agrarius has a significantly faster spontaneous acrosome reaction rate than A. sylvaticus and Mus. Conclusion Absence of CD 46 protein expression is associated with acrosomal instability in rodents. A. agrarius mice express novel CD 46 transcripts, resulting in the trade of spermatozoal CD 46 protein expression for a rapid acrosome reaction rate, in common with other species of <b>field</b> <b>mice.</b> This provides a strategy to increase competitive sperm advantage for individuals, leading to faster fertilisation in this highly promiscuous genus. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Longquan City, Zhejiang province, China, {{has been}} seriously {{affected}} by hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) {{since the first}} cases were registered in 1974. To understand the epidemiology and emergence of HFRS in Longquan, which may be indicative of large parts of rural China, we studied long-term incidence patterns and performed a molecular epidemiological investigation of the causative hantaviruses in human and rodent populations. METHOD/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During 1974 - 2011, 1866 cases of HFRS were recorded in Longquan, including 20 deaths. In 2011, the incidence of HFRS remained high, with 19. 61 cases/ 100, 000 population, despite the onset of vaccination in 1997. During 1974 - 1998, HFRS cases in Longquan occurred mainly in winter, while {{in the past decade}} the peak of HFRS has shifted to the spring. Notably, the concurrent prevalence of rodent-borne hantaviruses in the region was also high. Phylogenetic analyses of viral sequences recovered from rodents in Longquan revealed the presence of novel genetic variants of Gou virus (GOUV) in Rattus sp. rats and Hantaan virus (HTNV) in the <b>stripe</b> <b>field</b> <b>mice,</b> respectively. Strikingly, viral sequences sampled from infected humans were very closely related to those from rodents. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: HFRS represents an important public health problem in Longquan even after years of preventive measures. Our data suggest that continual spillover of the novel genetic variant of GOUV and the new genetic lineage of HTNV are responsible for the high prevalence of HFRS in humans. In addition, this is the first report of GOUV associated with human HFRS cases, and our data suggest that GOUV is now the major cause of HFRS in this region...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the prevalence of tick-borne infectious agents among ticks, ticks comprising five species from two genera (Hemaphysalis spp. and Ixodes spp.) were screened using molecular techniques. Ticks (3, 135) were collected from small wild-caught mammals or by dragging/flagging in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and were pooled into a total of 1, 638 samples (1 to 27 ticks per pool). From the 1, 638 tick samples, species-specific fragments of Anaplasma phagocytophilum (1 sample), Anaplasma platys (52 samples), Ehrlichia chaffeensis (29 samples), Ehrlichia ewingii (2 samples), Ehrlichia canis (18 samples), and Rickettsia rickettsii (28 samples) were amplified by PCR assay. Twenty-one pooled and individual tick samples had mixed infections of two (15 samples) or three (6 samples) pathogens. In addition, 424 spleen samples from small captured mammals (389 rodents, 33 insectivores, and 2 weasels) were screened for selected zoonotic pathogens. Species-specific DNA fragments of A. phagocytophilum (110 samples), A. platys (68 samples), E. chaffeensis (8 samples), E. ewingii (26 samples), E. canis (51 samples), and Rickettsia sp. (22 samples) were amplified by PCR assay. One hundred thirty small mammals had single infections, while 4, 14, and 21 <b>striped</b> <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> (Apodemus agrarius) had mixed infections of four, three, and two pathogens, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequence comparison also revealed that Korean strains of E. chaffeensis clustered closely with those from China and the United States, while the Rickettsia (rOmpA) sequences clustered within a clade together with a Chinese strain. These results suggest that these agents {{should be considered in}} differential diagnosis while examining cases of acute febrile illnesses in humans as well as animals in the ROK...|$|R
40|$|<b>Striped</b> <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> (Apodemus agrarius) are {{the main}} host for the Hantaan virus (HTNV), the cause of hemorrhagic fever with renal {{syndrome}} (HFRS) in central China. It {{has been shown that}} host population density is associated with pathogen dynamics and disease risk. Thus, a higher population density of A. agrarius in an area might indicate a higher risk for an HFRS outbreak. Here, we surveyed the A. agrarius population density between 2005 and 2012 on the Weihe Plain, Shaanxi Province, China, and used this monitoring data to examine the relationships between the dynamics of A. agrarius populations and environmental conditions of crop-land, represented by remote sensing based indicators. These included the normalized difference vegetation index, leaf area index, fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation, net photosynthesis (PsnNet), gross primary productivity, and land surface temperature. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to detect the possible causal relationship between PsnNet, A. agrarius population density and HFRS risk. The results showed that A. agrarius was the most frequently captured species with a capture rate of 0. 9 individuals per hundred trap-nights, during 96 months of trapping in the study area. The risk of HFRS was highly associated with the abundance of A. agrarius, with a 1 – 5 -month lag. The breeding season of A. agrarius was also found to coincide with agricultural activity and seasons with high PsnNet. The SEM indicated that PsnNet had an indirect positive effect on HFRS incidence via rodents. In conclusion, the remote sensing-based environmental indicator, PsnNet, was highly correlated with HTNV reservoir population dynamics with a 3 -month lag (r = 0. 46, p < 0. 01), and may serve as a predictor of potential HFRS outbreaks...|$|R

40|$|During the Korean {{war between}} 1951 - 1953, an {{epidemic}} occurred among United Nations sanctioned military troops, characterized by fever, haemorrhages, shock and renal failure {{with a case}} fatality rate of up to 15 %. This disease became known as Korean haemorrhagic fever [Smadel, 1951; Earle, 1954]. Despite extensive investigations at that time no etiologic agent could be identified. In the far east the oldest suggestive description of a similar disease had been made as early as 1000 {{years ago in a}} Chinese medicine book [Lee, 1982 a]. During the American Civil War between 1862 - 1866 epidemics of "general dropsy" with renal involvement were noted among northern army troops. This disease was later called "Bright's disease" [Brown, 1916]. In Europe the first descriptions of the disease appeared in the early 1900 's, after outbreaks in Russia and Scandinavia [Mayer, 1952; Myhrman, 1934; Zetterholm, 1934]. The Russians called the disease haemorrhagic nephroso-nephritis and the Scandinavians named it nephropathia epidemica (NE). During the trench-warfare of World War I in Europe, several epidemics of NE-like disease occurred among British, French and German troops. In the army medical records of the respective countries this "newly" described disease became known as "trench-nephritis", "nephrite de guerre" and "Kriegsnephritis" [Brown, 1916; Ameuille, 1916; Ullman, 1916]. In World War II several thousands of cases of "Kriegsnephritis" occurred among German troops in northern Finland [Stuhlfauth, 1943; Hortling, 1946]. Gajdusek postulated already in 1962 that all the above mentioned diseases were caused by a single agent or a closely related group of agents [Gajdusek, 1962]. In 1978, more than 25 {{years after the end of}} the Korean war, Lee and co-workers isolated the etiologic agent of Korean haemorrhagic fever, - Hantaan virus - from the lungs of Korean <b>striped</b> <b>field</b> <b>mice</b> (Apodemlls agrarills) [Lee et aI., 1978]. Outside Scandinavia and east Asia the first serologically confrrmed human cases of Hantaanlike virus infection were described in Belgium in 1983 [Desmyter et aI., 1983]. Subsequently, it has indeed become clear that all the above mentioned diseases are caused by closely related viruses [Gajdusek, 1982; Lee, 1989] which have now been included in the genus Hantavirus of the Bunyaviridae family. In 1983, the rodentborne viruses serologically related to Hantaan virus, all causing similar clinical symptoms, were labelled under the generic term haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) [WHO, 1983]...|$|R
40|$|Rhabdomys pumilio, in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, {{does not}} use short day length as an {{inhibitory}} cue for reproductive activity, and, despite previous records indicating that these mice are strictly seasonal in their reproduction, litters have been found during the winters of some years,both in the Eastern Cape and in the Western Cape. This led {{me to believe that}} the reproductive activity of Rhabdomys pumilio is more opportunistic and that the cue or cues used to control reproduction are less predictable and, or more variable than the photoperiod cue used by many seasonally reproducing rodents. Two experiments were conducted, investigating the influence of low ambient temperature (15 ⁰C) and reduced food availability on the reproductive activity of both male and female four <b>striped</b> <b>field</b> <b>mice.</b> Mice were maintained in one of four conditions (food restricted at 15 ⁰C, food restricted at 26 ⁰C, ad lib. food at 15 ⁰C, and ad lib. food at 26 ⁰C) for 4 (males) and 8 weeks (females) (photoperiod 12 L: 12 D, humidity 40 %). Results indicated that the males reduced their reproductive activity slightly when exposed to either low temperature or low food availability and that maximum inhibition of reproduction occurred when mice were exposed to both low temperature and low food availability. However, female reproductive activity was inhibited when exposed to low food availability, irrespective of the temperature. Both sexes of mice showed varying abilities to resist fat loss and, in the males, the size of the fat store had a significant effect on reproduction. This varying ability to resist fat loss could be related to levels of activity and in the females (where activity was quantified), high activity scores were significantly associated with reproductive inhibition. These results support the hypothesis that reproduction in Rhabdomys pumilio is opportunistic and controlled by the availability of energy. I propose that the females will be more sensitive to reproductive inhibition due to their far greater post-fertilization responsibilities, where the reproductive activity of the females is rapidly inhibited by a reduction in food availability, while the males are less readily inhibited by low food availability or low temperature, unless the change in the controlling factors is severe enough, or prolonged, at which stage their reproductive activity will cease. The significance of opportunistic reproduction in the seasonal but unpredictable climate of the study area is discussed...|$|R
