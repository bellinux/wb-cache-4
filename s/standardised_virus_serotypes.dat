To this end, six groups of five cattle were vaccinated with different FMD <b>virus</b> <b>serotype</b> A strain vaccines formulated with Montanide ISA 206 VG adjuvant. Antibody responses for homologous and heterologous cross-reactivity against a panel of 10 different FMD <b>virus</b> <b>serotype</b> A strains were tested by a liquid-phase blocking ELISA. Results of cattle vaccinated with ISA 206 VG adjuvanted vaccine were compared with results obtained in a previous study using aluminium hydroxide-saponin adjuvant. No significant effect of adjuvant on the breadth of the antibody response was observed, neither for mixing of antigens nor for the route of administration (subcutaneous vs. intradermal). Comparison of antigen payload, however, increased both homologous and heterologous titres; a 10 -fold higher antigen dose resulted in approximately four times higher titres against all tested strains. Our study shows that breadth of the antibody response depends mainly on the vaccine strain; we therefore propose that, for vaccine preparation, only FMD virus strains are selected that, among other important characteristics, will induce a wide antibody response to different field strains...|$|R

Recent phase III vaccine trials showed partial protection, and in particular no protection for dengue <b>virus</b> <b>serotype</b> 2 (refs 3, 4). Structural studies so far have characterized only epitopes recognized by serotype-specific human antibodies.

By the standard assays, patients experienced primary dengue virus infection (n = 30), secondary dengue virus infection (n = 48), Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus infection (n = 20), or no flavivirus infection (n = 26). The rapid test demonstrated 100 % sensitivity in the diagnosis of dengue virus infection and was able to distinguish between primary and secondary dengue virus infections through the separate determinations of IgM and IgG. For all patients with primary dengue virus infection a positive test for IgM to dengue virus and a negative test for IgG to dengue virus were obtained, whereas for 46 of 48 patients (96 %) with secondary dengue virus infection, a positive test for IgG to dengue virus with or without a positive test for IgM to dengue virus was obtained.
