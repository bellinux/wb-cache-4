Typically the row intended for a supply voltage is marked in red, while the row for ground is marked in blue or black. Some manufacturers connect all terminals in a column. Others just connect groups of, for example, 25 consecutive terminals in a column.

ILLIAC IV was designed by Burroughs Corporation and built in quadrants in Great Valley, PA during the years of 1967 through 1972.

40|$|In {{the past}} 2 decades the {{increasing}} intensive use of non-linear loads {{has resulted in}} a substantial reduction of power quality in electric power systems. Current harmonics produced by non-linear loads, such as power electronic converters and electrical drives cause a number of problems in power distribution networks. In more recent years this problem has affected also smaller distribution grids like for example in aircrafts, due to the so called "more electric aircraft" trend, consisting in the replacement of most of hydraulic/pneumatic actuators with electronically controlled electromechanical devices. Electrically powered actuation is becoming more attractive due to technology advances in bespoke equipment among which electrical motors, magnetic materials, electronic control circuits and power devices. Power electronics converters are required to control electrical power and are necessary for example for actuator motor drives and to convert variable frequency (360 - 800 Hz) in the next generation of civil aircraft to a constant frequency <b>supply</b> <b>bus</b> for various loads or to a DC <b>supply</b> <b>bus.</b> Although the presence of electrically powered equipment is desirable for weight and fuel cost reduction, the increase of electrical systems on board, and above all the presence of power electronic subsystems, brings severe challenges to aircraft power system distribution interns of power quality. The aim of this research project is to investigate Shunt Active Filter (SAF) solutions {{to improve the quality of}} power of on-board grids. In particular advanced control strategies will be studied in order to enhance the SAFs' operation in maintaining high power quality in these particular power networks. Anyway, only harmonics compensation will be addressed, as considered SAF are not intended to alleviate other power quality potential issues such as current unbalance between phases, reactive power compensation. This research project presents the specific application of a wide-band current control method based on Iterative Learning Control (ILC) for aircraft power networks, and introduces enhanced design strategies to increase compensation accuracy and improve the robustness of the SAF control system by using a P-type ILC controller. Due to the fact that a variable supply frequency (360 Hz - 800 Hz) is adopted in the power networks of newly released aircrafts, this research project presents a close investigation of the P-type ILC current controlled SAF system in such application (together with the standard fixed 400 Hz supply), and hence identifies suitable modifications for the SAF system control to provide an effective and accurate current harmonic cancellation during the supply frequency variation. Considering both simulation and experimental results, it can be concluded that the proposed SAF control proved to be very effective for accurate reduction of current harmonics on aircraft power grids with both fixed and variable supply frequency, using ordinary equipment and reasonable switching frequency and also ensuring good dynamics in transient conditions...|$|E
