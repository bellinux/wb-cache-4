5000|$|By 1951 Rolls {{was also}} {{advertising}} the Viceroy Electric Dry shaver, or, the ad said, {{if you have}} [...] "no electricity ... ask for the Viceroy non-electric mechanical dry shaver ... Press the lever and shave!" [...] This was a mechanical version of the dry shaver that was operated by repeatedly <b>squeezing</b> a <b>lever</b> on the handle.|$|R
40|$|Lever-action {{quick-release}} pin operated more easily. Mechanism operated with gloved hand. In modified version, lever added to handle to facilitate actuation. Lever action reduces actuation force. Lever-action pin operated by squeezing on any point of moveable ends of lever and handle together between {{thumb and forefinger}} or by simply grasping and <b>squeezing</b> handle and <b>lever</b> with entire hand in more natural grasp...|$|R
50|$|Another, unusual variant {{was found}} in the Ortgies {{semi-automatic}} pistols. To disengage the safety, a user would <b>squeeze</b> a <b>lever</b> until flush with the rear of the grip. The lever then would latch in the disengaged position until the user released it again by pressing a button under the slide, whereupon tension from the striker spring would push it back to the engaged position. Thus, engaging the safety also relieved some tension in the striker spring. As the Ortgies is a pocket pistol meant for personal defense, this feature eliminates the problem of failing to disengage the safety when one needs to shoot. Gripping the pistol tightly is all it takes to disengage the safety.|$|R
5000|$|Every walk-behind mower {{sold in the}} US since 1982 has a dead man's switch {{called an}} [...] "operator-presence control", which by law must stop the blades within 3 seconds after the user lets go of the controls. Attached across their handle is a {{mechanical}} lever connected by a flexible cable to the kill switch on the engine. While mowing, the operator must always <b>squeeze</b> the <b>lever</b> against the handle. If the operator ever loses grip of the handle the engine will die, stopping the blades from spinning and if equipped, any drive wheels from turning. This switch configuration also acts as the main kill switch for the engine. When the operator wants to stop the engine, they intentionally release the dead man's switch.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with most}} {{motorcycle}} arcade games, acceleration is performed by twisting the handle, steering is accomplished through leaning the bike's body left or right, and braking {{is done by}} <b>squeezing</b> a <b>lever.</b> As the race progresses, a three-layer turbo gauge will begin to fill automatically and the player can choose among three types of boosts: a short blue boost that's ready when the boost gauge quickly fills to 100%, a stronger green boost that requires the boost gauge to fill up to 200%, and an extremely powerful orange boost {{that can only be}} unleashed when the boost gauge fills to the maximum level of 300%, and will allow the character to critically knock out opponents who are in the way (to reflect the game's tagline, [...] "No mercy for anyone who stands in the way"). Boosts are activated by waiting for the gauge to fill up and twisting the acceleration handle twice whenever the desired boost type is available.|$|R
50|$|A {{strength}} tester {{machine is}} a type of amusement personality tester machine, which upon receiving credit rates the subject's strength, accordingly how strong the person presses <b>levers,</b> <b>squeezes</b> a grip or punches a punching bag. In the past, strength testers could mainly be found in penny arcades and amusement parks, but they are now also common in pub-style locations as well as video arcades, bowling alleys, family entertainment centers and disco venues. Modern strength testing machines have become redemption games and use LCDs for a video feedback, while some such as Sega's K.O. Punch (1981) use a video game display for feedback.|$|R
25|$|A {{rim band}} brake, as {{implemented}} on the Yankee bicycle by Royce Husted in the 1990s, {{consists of a}} stainless-steel cable, wrapped in a kevlar sheath, that rides in a u-shaped channel {{on the side of}} the wheel rim. <b>Squeezing</b> the brake <b>lever</b> tightens the cable against the channel to produce braking friction. A return spring slackens the cable when the brake lever is released, no adjustment is required, and the brake becomes more forceful when wet. Husted said his inspiration was the band brake used on industrial machinery. The Yankee bicycle only included a rear brake, but that met U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission standards.|$|R
25|$|In 1928, DuGas (later {{bought by}} ANSUL) {{came out with}} a cartridge-operated dry {{chemical}} extinguisher, which used sodium bicarbonate specially treated with chemicals to render it free-flowing and moisture-resistant. It consisted of a copper cylinder with an internal CO2cartridge. The operator turned a wheel valve on top to puncture the cartridge and <b>squeezed</b> a <b>lever</b> on the valve {{at the end of the}} hose to discharge the chemical. This was the first agent available for large-scale three-dimensional liquid and pressurized gas fires, and was but remained largely a specialty type until the 1950s, when small dry chemical units were marketed for home use. ABC dry chemical came over from Europe in the 1950s, with Super-K being invented in the early 60s and Purple-K being developed by the US Navy in the late 1960s. Manually applied dry agents such as graphite for class D (metal) fires had existed since WWII, but it wasn't until 1949 that Ansul introduced a pressurized extinguisher using an external CO2 cartridge to discharge the agent. Met-L-X (sodium chloride) was the first extinguisher developed in the US, with graphite, copper, and several other types being developed later.|$|R
2500|$|Aqueous {{film-forming}} foam (AFFF), used on A and B {{fires and}} for vapor suppression. The {{most common type}} in portable foam extinguishers. [...] AFFF {{was developed in the}} 1960s under Project Light Water in a joint venture between 3M and the U.S. Navy. AFFF forms a film that floats out before the foam blanket, sealing the surface and smothering the fire by excluding oxygen. AFFF is widely used for ARFF firefighting at airports, often as a twin agent unit (TAU) with purple-K dry chemical.It contains fluoro-tensides [...] which can be accumulated in the human body. The long-term effects of this on the human body and environment are unclear at this time. AFFF can be discharged through an air-aspirating branchpipe nozzle or a spray nozzle, and is now produced only in pre-mix form, where the foam concentrate is stored mixed with water. In the past, as solid charge model was produced, where the AFFF concentrate was housed as a dry compound in an external, disposable cartridge in a specially designed nozzle. The extinguisher body was charged with plain water, and the discharge pressure mixed the foam concentrate with the water upon <b>squeezing</b> the <b>lever.</b> These extinguishers received double the rating of a pre-mix model (40-B instead of 20-B), but are now considered obsolete, as parts and refill cartridges have been discontinued by the manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{unconfirmed}} Soviet aircraft flown were MiG-25 Foxbat (YF-116); MiG-29 Fulcrum (YF-118) and Sukhoi Su-22 Fitter (YF-112). Crashes {{associated with}} the foreign aircraft included the 1979 Tonopah MiG-17 crash during training versus an F-5 and the 1984 Little Skull Mountain MiG-23 crash which killed a USAF general, Robert M. Bond. Aerial dogfights were staged between the various MiG models against virtually every fighter in US service, and against SAC’s B-52 Stratofortress and B-58 Hustlers to judge {{the ability of the}} bombers countermeasures systems, they performed radar cross-section and propulsion tests that contributed greatly to improvements in US aerial performance.All the models had quirks. The MiG-17 did not have an electric seat, so pilots had to use cushions to position themselves properly inside the cockpit. Both it and the MiG-21 had pneumatic brakes applied by <b>squeezing</b> a <b>lever</b> {{on the front of the}} stick. Many of the MiG-21s did not have steerable nose gears, making them difficult to taxi; the sign of a novice Fishbed pilot was the zigzag track he made while moving on the ground. If a pilot put the throttle back on a MiG-21, it would take a long time to spool up again when trying to accelerate. Thus many of those who flew it stayed on afterburners as much as possible. The MiG-23 did not have that problem, as it was designed for speed—but it was unstable and difficult to fly.|$|R
50|$|The {{single cable}} from the handlebar's rear brake lever divides into two cables which are routed to {{opposite}} sides of the stem or fork steer tube and into cable stops. The inner cables connect to metal tabs on a disc attached to the upper side of a thrust bearing placed around the stem or steer tube. <b>Squeezing</b> the brake <b>lever</b> pulls the inner cables and causes the bearing assembly to rise. A second disc is attached {{to the bottom of the}} thrust bearing such that the entire assembly moves together up and down the steering axis while each disc can rotate independently around the axis. A second set of cables are attached to tabs on this lower disc and pass through cable stops mounted on the either side of the head tube. The two lower cables merge back into one and then are routed to the rear brake. The cables are split in this way to ensure that the detangler mechanism moves equally on both sides.|$|R
50|$|The Natter had no landing gear, which saved weight, {{expense and}} {{construction}} time. Consequently, {{one of the}} most unusual features of the machine was the escape of the pilot and recovery of the machine. The proposed sequence of these events was as follows: After the attack, the Natter might dive to a lower altitude and flatten out into level flight. The pilot would then proceed with a well-practised escape sequence. He would open the cockpit canopy latch; the canopy flicking backwards on its hinge in the airstream; he would undo his seat belt and remove his feet from the rudder pedal stirrups. By <b>squeezing</b> a <b>lever</b> mounted on the control column, he would release a lock {{at the base of the}} column, which would allow him to tilt the column forwards where it could engage in and undo a safety latch for the nose release mechanism. He would then lean a little further forward and pull a lever hinged near the floor at the front of the cockpit. This action frees the nose section, which self-jettisoned as a result of the reduced aerodynamic pressure at the front of the fuselage. As the nose section separates, it was intended to briefly pull on two cables that release a small ribbon parachute stored on the starboard side of the rear fuselage. The parachute subsequently opens and decelerates the Natter. The pilot would be ejected from the cockpit by his own inertia and as soon as he was clear of the fuselage, he would open his personal parachute and descend to the ground.|$|R
2500|$|The grip of this pistol {{features}} a built-in cocking lever {{located at the}} front of the grip. Before the pistol can be fired, this lever must be squeezed; thus this lever acts as a safety. [...] The pistol is striker fired. <b>Squeezing</b> the cocking <b>lever</b> with a force of [...] cocks the firing pin. Once fully depressed, only 2 pounds of force are required to keep the weapon cocked. The weapon is then fired by pressing the single stage trigger rated at approximately [...] As long as the lever is depressed, the weapon fires like any other semi-automatic pistol. If the lever is released, the weapon is immediately de-cocked and rendered safe. This method of operation dispensed the need for a manual safety selector while providing safety for the user carrying the pistol with a chambered round, and increased the speed with which the pistol could be deployed and fired. The trigger and firing mechanism's method of operation (and the unique slide catch) were protected by , issued on January 2, 1979.|$|R
2500|$|Trimethoxyboroxine(TMB)liquid is a boron {{compound}} {{dissolved in}} methanol {{to give it}} proper fluidity {{and allow it to}} be discharged from a portable fire extinguisher. It was developed in the late 1950s by the U.S. Navy for use on magnesium fires, especially crashed aircraft and aircraft wheel fires from hard landings. It is unique as an extinguishing agent in that the agent itself is a flammable liquid. When TMB contacts the fire, the methanol ignites and burns with a greenish flame due to the boron. As the methanol burns off, a glassy coating of boric oxide is left {{on the surface of the}} metal, creating an air-excluding crust. These extinguishers were made by the Ansul Chemical Co. utilizing TMB agent manufactured by the Callery Chemical Company, and were modified 2.5-gallon water extinguishers (Ansul used re-branded Elkhart extinguishers at the time), with a variable-stream nozzle that could deliver a straight stream or spray at the <b>squeeze</b> of a <b>lever.</b> A 6-inch fluorescent orange band with the letters [...] "TMB" [...] stenciled in black identified TMB from other extinguishers. This agent was problematic in that it had a shelf life of only six months to a year once the extinguisher was filled, since the methanol is extremely hygroscopic (absorbs moisture from the air), which causes corrosion to the extinguisher and renders its use on fire dangerous. These extinguishers were used from the 1950s–70s in various applications, such as the MB-1 and MB-5 crash trucks. The current SOP is to use water fog and cool/burn out the burning metal.|$|R
