5|$|I. C. Filitti {{was not in}} {{a celebratory}} mood as the National Liberals publicized their August 1916 Treaty, when Romania became part of the Entente. His diaries record not only his general frustration, but also his belief that the decades of PNL rule had left the {{military}} ill-prepared, and claims about generalized embezzlement within the Army. He was soon after drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, as officer of the Second Field Army, and stationed in Bucharest. When the German-led counteroffensive forced the army on the retreat, resulting in the Central Powers' occupation of southern Romania, Filitti took his most controversial decision. In circumstances that are largely unknown, he opted to <b>stay</b> <b>behind</b> in occupied territory, and greeted the enemy. According to Boia, Filitti received two contradictory orders: one to follow the Imperial Russian Army as liaison officer, the other to <b>stay</b> <b>behind</b> in Bucharest; he conveniently opted to follow the latter.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the wing}} {{had the option of}} moving with the F-15s to Barnes, but most decided to <b>stay</b> <b>behind</b> and train for new missions.

The buildings formerly occupied by the fighter wing, including the hangars, will be occupied by the intelligence mission.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the exact}} {{details of the}} {{assassination}} remain disputed, {{the involvement of the}} Portuguese government, particularly Aginter Press or PIDE, is generally accepted by most historians and biographers and is supported by the Portuguese <b>stay</b> <b>behind</b> Gladio-esque army, known as Aginter Press, that suggested in 1990 that they were responsible for the assassination. Initially, due to the uncertainty regarding who was responsible, Mondlane's death created great suspicion within the ranks of the FRELIMO itself and a short power struggle which resulted in a dramatic swing to the political left.|$|E
5|$|Deke finally catches up. He {{allows the}} {{remaining}} {{members of the}} posse to take the bullet-riddled bodies of the gang members back and collect the reward, while electing to <b>stay</b> <b>behind,</b> knowing what awaits the posse.

5|$|In an {{era when}} defencemen were {{expected}} to <b>stay</b> <b>behind</b> during the play, Stuart became known {{for his ability to}} score goals while playing a defensive role, and for his ability to remain calm during matches that often turned violent.

5|$|A senior {{national}} team official, Colonel Roman Lisiewicz of the Polish Army, {{said he saw}} the goalkeeper and the journalist reach the hotel in a taxi soon after 05:00—but rather than going to his room, Młynarczyk then left again with Zieliński before returning again around 07:00. Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined {{the rest of the}} players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting worked up about possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him. Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, Bernard Blaut, confronted Smolarek and told him that Młynarczyk was to <b>stay</b> <b>behind.</b>|$|E

5|$|Flooding was {{reported}} throughout the Outer Banks {{in relation to}} the heavy rains and storm surge of the storm. The storm required the shutdown of North Carolina Highway 12, the only highway connecting the area to the mainland, isolating those who decided to <b>stay</b> <b>behind.</b> Many residents lost power as numerous power lines fell from strong winds. Six brief tornadoes, ranging between F0 and F1 on the Fujita scale, struck the state within squall lines in the outer rainbands of Hurricane Bob. Four tornadoes in Dare County, North Carolina, caused $256,000 in damage. Near Cape Hatteras, wind severely damaged one structure, which lost its roof and some siding.|$|E

5|$|Jim wanders back to Suzhou Creek. Along the way {{he hears}} news of Japan's {{surrender}} {{and the end of}} the war. He encounters the Japanese teenager he befriended earlier, who has since become a pilot but is now disillusioned. The youth remembers Jim and offers him a mango, and will cut it for him with his katana. Basie reappears with a group of armed Americans who have arrived to loot the Red Cross containers being airdropped over the area.

Basie offers to help Jim find his parents, but Jim—infuriated over his friend's death—chooses to <b>stay</b> <b>behind.</b>|$|E
5|$|Louise Nevelson {{was born}} Leah Berliawsky in 1899 in Perislav, Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire, to Minna Sadie and Isaac Berliawsky, a {{contractor}} and lumber merchant. Even though the family lived comfortably, Nevelson's relatives {{had begun to}} leave the Russian Empire for America in the 1880s. The Berliawskys had to <b>stay</b> <b>behind,</b> as Isaac, the youngest brother, had to care for his parents. While still in Europe, Minna gave birth to two of Nevelson's siblings: Nathan (born 1898) and Anita (1902). On his mother's death, Isaac moved to the United States in 1902. After he left, Minna and the children moved to the Kiev area. According to family lore, young Nevelson was so forlorn about her father's departure that she became mute for six months.|$|E

5|$|Members of Picidae are {{typically}} monogamous, {{with a few}} species breeding cooperatively and some polygamy reported in a few species. Polyandry, where a female raises two broods with two separate males, has also {{been reported in the}} West Indian woodpecker. Another unusual social system is that of the acorn woodpecker, which is a polygynandrous cooperative breeder where groups of up to 12 individuals breed and help to raise the young. Young birds from previous years may <b>stay</b> <b>behind</b> to help raise the group's young, and studies have found reproductive success for the group goes up with group size, but individual success goes down. Birds may be forced to remain in groups {{due to a lack of}} habitat to disperse to.|$|E
