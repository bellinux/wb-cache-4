5|$|August 9, 1970 was a Sunday, and Flight 502 was {{originally}} scheduled to depart Cuzco at 8:30 am, but <b>since</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{members of the}} American group wanted to visit the nearby Pisac native handicraft market prior to leaving for Lima, the airline postponed the departure time to 2:45 pm.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} {{applications}} in industry, but their main use is as additives to animal feed. This is necessary, <b>since</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bulk components of these feeds, such as soybeans, either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids: lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds. In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals.|$|E
5|$|During the 2nd centuryBC, Roman {{territory}} saw {{an overall}} decline in population, partially {{due to the}} huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes into lower classes of the census and the proletarii. As a result, both the Roman society and its military became increasingly proletarianised. The Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers {{at the expense of}} the state, <b>since</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers who made up its lower classes were now impoverished proletarii in all but name, and were too poor to afford their own equipment.|$|E

5|$|Venture kept to {{a steady}} {{bimonthly}} schedule for ten issues, but its circulation never reached a sustainable level, and it was canceled in mid-1958. The large number of competing magazines probably hurt sales, though <b>since</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competitors lasted for {{only one or two}} issues, Venture {{can be thought of as}} at least a partial success. An anthology drawn from the magazine's fiction, No Limits, was published in 1964 by Ballantine Books, attributed to Joseph Ferman as editor.|$|E
5|$|Bats play an {{important}} role in forest and cave ecology in Puerto Rico and help control mosquito populations. Most species (10 of 13) are cave-dwellers with low reproductive rates; the area with the highest species richness is the Caribbean National Forest, where eleven species occur. The red fig-eating bat (red fruit bat), endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank, plays {{an important}} role in the ecology of tabonuco forest in the Luquillo Mountains since it is believed to be the only seed disperser of bulletwood (Manilkara bidentata). Cave ecosystems are enhanced by bat feces (guano) <b>since</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> invertebrate cave fauna are either guano scavengers, detritivores or predators of the former two.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{therefore}} began {{raising a}} huge new army {{with which he}} meant to completely subjugate Greece. However, he died before the invasion could begin. The throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I, who quickly resumed the preparations for the invasion of Greece, including building two pontoon bridges across the Hellespont. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water {{as a gesture of}} their submission, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta (both of whom were at open war with Persia). Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed (hereafter referred to as 'the Allies'). This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially <b>since</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.|$|E
50|$|Sri Lanka {{has been}} issuing {{souvenir}} sheets <b>since</b> 1966. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest souvenir sheets issued by Sri Lanka are valuable. Sri Lanka issues souvenir sheets {{each year on}} many different themes.|$|R

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Hazel, a three-day period of national mourning was declared in Haiti for hurricane victims. With existing infrastructure already poor, the recovery was very slow <b>since</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few existing roads were blocked, and communications equipment was either out, damaged, or destroyed. The Haitian Red Cross appealed for assistance to the International Red Cross, while the American Red Cross made a donation of $25,000 (1954 USD). Pan American World Airways offered the use of its planes {{to assist with the}} delivery of aid, and the US aircraft carrier USS Saipan deployed 18 helicopters to help deliver supplies. Despite the relief effort, there was an outbreak of typhoid fever following Hazel {{due to a lack of}} clean water.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards {{the back of the}} house. One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located {{toward the back of the}} main room, were also present in many of the houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, <b>since</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the filming}} was completed, more than 20 two-hour Beta SP video tapes of footage {{had to be}} edited down to fit {{the actions of the}} game. The {{programming}} included editing the original video footage, and mixing the rendered images of doors, drawers, chairs and other objects into the footage frame-by-frame, which was necessary for more than 100 scenes. The game required more polishing and fine-tuning than most games of its time due to the many video components, and the programmers had to determine the desired frame rate, data transfer rate and desired resolution of the video elements. Another challenge for the game was CD resource management. <b>Since</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scenes in the game could be repeated in multiple chapters, some pieces of the code were written onto several different CDs {{to reduce the number of}} times the player had to swap discs in the middle of a chapter, an unusual practice for computer games at the time. The final game was on seven discs, a large number for a computer game, and more than the four or five discs originally expected.|$|E
2500|$|Those barristers {{who are not}} QCs {{are called}} Junior Counsel and are styled [...] "BL" [...] or [...] "Barrister-at-Law". The term junior is often {{misleading}} <b>since</b> <b>many</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Junior Bar are experienced barristers with considerable expertise.|$|R
25|$|Watch Tower Society eschatological teachings {{are based}} on <b>the</b> {{earliest}} writings <b>of</b> Charles Taze Russell, but have undergone significant changes <b>since</b> then. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> changes reflect altered views on <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dates 1874, 1914, 1918, and 1925.|$|R

5|$|The Athenians {{had also}} been {{preparing}} for war with the Persians since the mid-480s BC, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, {{under the guidance of}} the Athenian politician Themistocles, to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be necessary for the Greeks to fight the Persians. However, the Athenians did not have the manpower to fight on land and sea; and therefore combating the Persians would require an alliance of Greek city states. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta. Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed. It had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially <b>since</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} religious {{beliefs of the}} Sakizaya are currently experiencing external pressures <b>since</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tribesmen may have converted to Christianity. The threat is heightened by the increasing importance of Christianity to the community.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>the</b> {{validity}} <b>of</b> this linguistic area is doubtful, {{as pointed}} out by Jacobsen (1986), <b>since</b> <b>many</b> traits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Basin area are also common to California languages. It may be an extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern California linguistic area.|$|R
50|$|<b>Since</b> <b>many</b> fans <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Hockey League's Pittsburgh Penguins (who play at Consol Energy Center) {{are also}} fans of Robert Morris and Penn State, {{the two teams}} are planned to be {{fixtures}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tournament in years to come.|$|R

25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{mountains}} surrounding Pachuca lack tree cover, little {{slows the}} prevailing winds which can reach speeds {{of up to}} 120km per hour. This gives the capital city the nickname of La Bella Airosa (Beautiful Windy City).|$|E

25|$|The {{city would}} not be sacked in {{exchange}} for the payment of two months to each one of the participant soldiers in the attack.

25|$|Agostini {{was also}} a {{composer}} of accompanied solo song; <b>since</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performers at the court were instrumentalists in addition to singers (for example Livia d'Arco was a virtuoso player of the viol) he wrote for both lute and viol as accompaniment to solo singers.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, little {{information}} is available on non-Muslim as there is limited data regarding irreligious groups and minorities, especially <b>since</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hindu and Sikh in Pashtun area migrated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after the partition of India and later, after {{the rise of the}} Taliban. There is a community of Pashtun Sikhs in Peshawar, Parachinar, and Orakzai Agency of FATA, Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gauls and Germans joined Caesar's army {{after his}} victory over Gaul, their war chants {{were added to}} the Roman oeuvre of army songs: When 2000 {{soldiers}} from the Gallic cavalry defected to Octavian before the battle of Actium, they didn't only cheer for Caesar but presented genuine Gallic war songs. Probably the most popular vocal performers were the Celtic bards, whose national heroic songs were known in Rome throughout antiquity.|$|E
