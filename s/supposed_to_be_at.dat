5|$|The High Sparrow chides Queen Margaery Tyrell {{that she}} needs to provide King Tommen Baratheon with an heir, and that she should try to convert her {{grandmother}} Olenna to the Faith, subtly remarking that Olenna's safety cannot be guaranteed otherwise. Margaery meets with Olenna, who attempts to convince her to leave King's Landing and return to Highgarden. Margaery refuses, stating that as Queen, her place is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> King Tommen's side. Margaery discreetly slips her a piece of paper with the sigil of House Tyrell drawn on it, indicating that she is still loyal to her family, upon which Olenna agrees to leave. Cersei Lannister then confronts Olenna, and tries to convince her to stay and fight the Sparrows. Olenna points out that they have already lost and blames the Sparrows' rise to power on Cersei's lack of foresight. Despite having no allies in King's Landing, Cersei decides to stay and fight.|$|E
25|$|Melbourne Victory {{also play}} home matches at Docklands. Originally, {{the plan was}} that the stadium would only be used for A-League games against the Victory's biggest rivals, Sydney FC, in the 2006/07 A-League season due to the {{prediction}} of a large crowd. All other games were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> the Victory's usual home ground, Olympic Park Stadium. A record crowd of 39,730 attended the game. After the success of the game, the Victory found Olympic Park's capacity of 18,000 too small, especially after the Round 4 match at Olympic Park attracted a capacity crowd of 17,617. Melbourne then moved all their home games except one against the struggling New Zealand Knights to Docklands for the 2006/07 season. The move was a success, with a 27,000 crowd average. The Victory decided to move all their home games permanently from the 2007/08 season. This also gave the stadium a major summer tenant, which the stadium lacked in its early years.|$|E

25|$|The {{role of the}} two gods at the kalendae {{of every}} month is that of {{presiding}} over {{the birth of the}} new moon. Janus and Juno cooperate as the first looks after the passage from the previous to the ensuing month while the second helps it through the strength of her vitality. The rites of the kalendae included the invocations to Juno Covella, giving the number of days to the nonae, a sacrifice to Janus by the rex sacrorum and the pontifex minor at the curia Calabra and one to Juno by the regina sacrorum in the Regia: originally when the month was still lunar the pontifex minor had the task of signalling the appearance of the new moon. While the meaning of the epithet Covella is unknown and debated, that of the rituals is clear as the divine couple is supposed to oversee, protect and help the moon during the particularly dangerous time of her darkness and her labours: the role of Juno Covella is hence {{the same as that of}} Lucina for women during parturition. The association of the two gods is reflected on the human level at the difficult time of labours as is apparent in the custom of putting a key, symbol of Janus, in the hand of the woman with the aim of ensuring an easy delivery, while she had to invoke Juno Lucina. At the nonae Caprotinae similarly Juno had the function of aiding and strengthening the moon as the nocturnal light, at the time when her force was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> its lowest, after the Summer solstice.|$|E
500|$|After Ødegaard {{signed for}} Real Madrid, Norwegian former {{football}} scout Tor-Kristian Karlsen praised his mentality, stating {{that he had}} [...] "overcome every challenge in front of him". Karlsen called him [...] "so level-headed and mature" [...] and noted his intelligence and performance at school, while also saying {{that this could be}} a disadvantage as [...] "The best footballers tend to have a bit of needle, a bit of fire". While former Norway international Jan Åge Fjørtoft was supportive of the transfer to Real Madrid due to the opportunity to learn from Zidane, he warned that at the age of 16 he needed time to develop: [...] "Comparing Ødegaard to Messi is nonsense from the media. Messi is a player who can make the difference and Martin can do the same, but any comparisons should not be taken seriously". Ødegaard reacted to the attention on him by saying [...] "If you get carried away now, you won't get far in 10 years. I'm <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> my best then, not now. That I know".|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss {{said on the}} episode's DVD audio {{commentary}} {{that while}} the episode was [...] "full of funny moments", it caused [...] "nothing but trouble" [...] to {{the staff of the}} show. One of the troubles was that after the episode had been written by Swartzwelder, an unsolicited writer sent the staff a script which contained a virtually identical story. To avoid a lawsuit, the staff paid him US$3000 and went forward with the episode. Material cut from the episode's script included many couples who were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> the retreat instead of the Flanders family, such as Mr. Burns and his mail-order bride, and Mrs. Krabappel trying to reunite with her estranged husband Ken Krabappel. Reiss said the scene played out [...] "horribly badly", and it appeared as if Mr. Burns's mail-order bride was a prostitute. The Ken Krabappel character was supposed to be based on singer Dean Martin, but somehow he ended up with a southern accent that made him sound like a hick. The whole scene was rewritten with help from producer James L. Brooks and it was completed after several hours. A scene in which Moe asked Dr. Hibbert to cure his discolored feces was also removed during the first reading of the script after a complaint by Brooks. Series creator Matt Groening later expressed an objection to the ending, which sees General Sherman jumping {{out of the water and}} winking at the camera, believing it to be overly cartoony.|$|E

500|$|Ashmore {{indicates}} that his casting {{was both a}} surprise and what he wanted. The actor states, [...] "I auditioned for [...] and I put myself on tape. I hadn't heard anything, {{and a couple of}} weeks later, all of the sudden, I got the call saying, 'You're going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville.' It's a dream come true, really." [...] Aaron Ashmore's twin, Shawn, who is better known as Bobby [...] "Iceman" [...] Drake in the X-Men film series, appeared in two episodes of Smallville as the power leeching Eric Summers. After three seasons with the show, two as a series regular, Ashmore was written out of the series. According to Ashmore, when the producers were first trying to get permission to use the character on Smallville, DC Comics had qualms over how close Jimmy was in age to Clark and Lois, as the character was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> least ten years younger. The producers guaranteed the department they would eventually reveal the Jimmy Olsen who appeared on the show was not the Jimmy Olsen who would one day work alongside Clark and Lois. At the character's funeral, his full name is shown to be [...] "Henry James Olsen", and it is alluded that Jimmy's younger brother, who is given a brief appearance at the funeral, is the DC Comics version of Jimmy Olsen who will one day work at the Daily Planet with Clark and Lois. Although Ashmore was sad to leave the show, he feels that the redemptive story that was given to Jimmy in the finale, through the self-sacrifice he makes for Chloe, makes a good send off for his character.|$|E

[...] After that, the queen and the FBI were {{supposed}} to go to a hotel in Kona, and instead they went to Iolani’s house in Napoopoo, where she summoned all the animals to greet the queen. Her dog barked, her cat meowed, her rooster crowed, her pig oinked, and they bowed to the queen. When someone said that they are not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> Iolani’s house, an FBI agent replied, 'If she can stop the wind, we are going to be here.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{attack was}} orchestrated by Genovese boss Vincent Gigante, with {{the backing of}} Lucchese leaders Vittorio [...] "Vic" [...] Amuso and Anthony [...] "Gaspipe" [...] Casso. The bomb was {{intended}} to kill both DeCicco and Gotti, who was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> the club for a meeting with Gravano and DeCicco. Gotti, however, couldn't make the meeting and rescheduled for later that evening at the Ravenite Social Club in Manhattan. Failla and fellow capo Daniel Marino were two of Castellano's closest associates before his death and both men were in on Gigante's plot. In exchange for a promise to be designated co-leaders of the Gambino family after the assassinations, Failla and Marino provided intelligence and tipped off the plotters to the planned meeting in Bensonhurst. The plotters reportedly used a car bomb for the attack in order to divert suspicion. The method had its intended effect, as Gotti and Gravano considered and dismissed the possibility that Gigante was behind the plot, reasoning, [...] "e wouldn't use... bombs." ...|$|E

2500|$|These {{developments}} made it {{more likely}} that the NLRB would be the one to decide the fate of the strike. [...] Chairman Gould believed that General Counsel Feinstein was delaying the ULP investigation (perhaps to give negotiations a chance to work), but was troubled when Feinstein allegedly suggested that he become the Board's chief spokesperson. Because the Board and the General Counsel are legally independent entities by law, Gould refused to let Feinstein take the lead. [...] Feinstein asked that he be allowed to speak to the entire Board on the issue. [...] Truesdale and NLRB member James Stephens voiced considerable concern over this proposed meeting, as issues in the strike were likely to come before the Board and since the General Counsel and Board were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> arm's length. When Feinstein became upset at their comments, Gould suggested that he approach the Board's members himself. [...] Feinstein did so, and won a meeting with the Board on March 8. But four of the five members of the Board expressed their dissatisfaction with Feinstein's proposal, and it was dropped.|$|E
