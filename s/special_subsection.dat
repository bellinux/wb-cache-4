Though not as {{physically}} powerful as Space Marines, {{they are more}} extensively trained and better armed than their guardsmen counterparts. The Tempestus Scions function {{in much the same}} capacity as modern day special forces, deploying in smaller numbers and are invariably tasked to accomplish important strategic goals during a military campaign, conducting their operations with surgical precision often far from friendly lines. Due to their elite training and specialist skills, some regiments are permanently seconded by the Imperial Inquisition as Inquisitorial Storm Troopers.|$|E

40|$|There is a French {{version of}} this paper: W. Visser (2010). Visser: le design comme {{construction}} de représentations. Collection [version française](2), 29 - 45. In this chapter, we present our own approach to design, as we have described it in The Cognitive Artifacts of Designing: from a cognitive viewpoint, designing is constructing representations. What is this link between design and repre-sentations? Designing consists in specifying an artifact, for example a machine tool - not in its implementation, its fabrication in the workshop. The result of design is a representation: the speci-fications of the machine tool. These representa-tions are also artifacts, that is, entities created by people - they are "man-made as opposed to natu-ral" (Simon, 1969 / 1996). Artifacts may be physical (machine tools, buildings, cars, or garments) or symbolic (software, social welfare policies, route plans, or any procedure); they may be internal (mental representations) or external (drawings, mock-ups). The term thus pertains not only to material objects. The antonym of an "artifact" is a "natural"- not an "immaterial" entity. After a presentation of our definition of de-sign, this chapter presents three types of activities designers perform on representations, namely generation, transformation, and evaluation. In <b>special</b> <b>subsections,</b> we review the use of knowl-edge in design, and how collaborative design proceeds through interaction. In the last two divi-sions of this section, we discuss activities that are specific to collaborative design...|$|R
50|$|The FA {{played a}} very {{important}} role in the intercepting communications of the government of the Federal State of Austria before the Anschluss occupation in March 1938. A <b>special</b> <b>subsection</b> in the FA was formed, and subsequently the entire communications system of Austria was intercepted. They were increasingly aided in their operation by sympathetic Austrian officials. All telephone conversations carried out in Austrian ministries, the content of all telegrams sent abroad, and many important documents were sent to the Forschungsamt. The Austrian officials even went as far as to provide all the cryptographic systems used by the Foreign Office in Vienna, by the Austrian Armed Forces and by the Austrian Police. The Austrian telephone and telegraph cables leading through the Berchtesgaden areas were tapped by the FA.|$|E
5000|$|EPD (Eukaryotic Promoter Database) is a {{biological}} database and web resource of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II promoters with experimentally defined transcription start sites. Originally, EPD was a manually curated resource relying on transcript mapping experiments (mostly primer extension and nuclease protection assays) targeted at individual genes {{and published in}} academic journals. More recently, automatically generated promoter collections derived from electronically distributed high-throughput data produced with the CAGE or TSS-Seq [...] protocols were added {{as part of a}} <b>special</b> <b>subsection</b> named EPDnew. The EPD web server offers additional services, including an entry viewer which enables users to explore the genomic context of a promoter in a UCSC Genome Browser window, and direct links for uploading EPD-derived promoter subsets to associated web-based promoter analysis tools of the Signal Search Analysis (SSA) and ChIP-Seq servers. EPD also features a collection of position weight matrices (PWMs) for common promoter sequence motifs.|$|E

40|$|The urban heat {{island is}} one of the main {{environmental}} effects of humans. In this paper the urban climate of a Central/Eastern European capital (Budapest, Hungary) is analyzed using both satellite-based and in-situ measurements. Our study focuses on Ferencvaros, one of the 23 districts of the Hungarian capital. It is located near the river Danube in the southern central part of the city, which is very heterogeneous and consisting of 3 - and 4 -storey old buildings, block houses with either 4 or 8 levels, brown industrial areas, and large areas occupied by the railways system. Partly due to the functional and structural changes of <b>special</b> <b>subsections</b> of the district substantial local climatic changes occurred in the past few decades. From the local government concentrated efforts were made to complete several block rehabilitation programs already starting from 1980 s. Since 1993 in the most densely built inner part of the district entire blocks were renovated and modified in order to create more livable environment for the citizens. Within the framework of these programs inner parts of the blocks were demolished, thus, inside the blocks more common green areas could be created. The climatic effects are evaluated on the basis of the following data. (1) Satellite measurements, namely, surface temperature fields derived from radiation data of infrared channels measured by sensor MODIS (onboard satellites Terra and Aqua), and sensor ASTER (onboard satellite Terra). From the surface temperature data rural mean values around Budapest are used to calculate pixelwise SUHI (surface urban heat island intensity). (2) In-situ temperature and relative humidity measurements within the rehabilitated sections. Our main goal is to analyze whether the generally positive changes of the built environment can also be recognized in the urban heat island effect of this area...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze {{legislative}} regulation of the transfers of the ownership of the cooperative apartments. The reason for my research is, because I consider this topic to be hot, relevant and still developing, moreover with new Czech private law legislation, which is coming into force on 1 st January 2014. This thesis composes of four chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of transfers of ownerships of cooperative apartments. Chapter one is introductory and defines basic terminology important for understanding this thesis. It is subdivided into for subsections. First subsection introduce cooperative company, it`s principles and more. Second subsection investigates housing cooperatives as special type of cooperatives, it`s legal base and <b>special</b> forms. Third <b>subsection</b> deals with definition of apartment and the last subsection with cooperative apartments. Second chapter in this thesis is addresses issue of comparison of ownership, rent or cooperative rent, deals with every regime and finds out cons and pros of each one of them. Third chapter is the main one, which illustrates types of transfers of the ownership of the cooperative apartments, which are possible in Czech law. It also deals with procedure of transfer itself and introduces special conditions in certain [...] ...|$|R
40|$|SSO: USA and the Environmental Design Research Association (EDRA) are {{two small}} {{research}} organizations that share similar histories, having {{grown out of}} the need to investigate the relationship of daily occupations/ human behavior, health and well-being, and theories grounded in the interaction between person, environment, and occupation/behavior. However, while EDRA formally began its life almost 35 years prior to SSO, and has grown from an organization of 30 members to an annual conference with 300 - 400 participants, EDRA‚s strengths lie in its interdisciplinary approach to understanding the link between the environment and occupation/behavior. It could be said that EDRA members think like occupational scientists‚ and that occupational scientists have adopted environment and behavior methodologies. So, as EDRA approaches 40 and SSO turns 3, each organization has much to share with, and learn from the other in understanding how to create robust, healthy lives. An organizational case study of these two small research societies will be presented. Similarities and differences in constituency, mission/purpose, and focus will be highlighted. Of particular interest to SSO members is how EDRA has changed over time to continue to respond to societal issues (such as the increasing incidence of obesity, and the needs of the aging population) by the formation of new <b>special</b> interest <b>subsections</b> (including the Active Living by Design group, and the Participation network) that reflect the needs and interests of all of its constituencies, including sponsors/funders, practitioners, educators, students and users/clients. These changes have been critical in the success of the members to secure grant-funding for research that enhances community participation through an understanding of person-environment-occupation fit. This organizational case study will focus on a content analysis of topics presented at the EDRA conference in 1984, 1994 and 2004, to illustrate the change in focus and methodologies over time, as well as interviews of a representative sample of 2004 presenters rega rding the funding sources that supported their work. Discussion will include reflections of a long-time (30 + years) EDRA member (a research architect), and a newer (2 years) EDRA member (an occupational scientist / occupational therapist), as well as suggestions for possible collaborations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a {{holistic approach to}} the study of sustainable development of global product chains. We first present a number of perspectives on this topic from disciplines such as economic geography, management science, sociology and environmental sciences. Each of these approaches brings in a specific focus: the consequences of geographical dispersion of economic activities, measurement of ecological and social impact, managing sustainability in supply chains, and power asymmetry among economic actors. Until now, these disciplinary research lines have remained unconnected. We argue that ecological economics provides a promising background for a more holistic conceptualization. To this end, we formulate five basic questions that serve to advance the study of sustainability throughout the product chain by connecting the foci of the identified scientific disciplines. The aim of advancing a holistic perspective has guided the selection of papers for this <b>special</b> <b>subsection,</b> which are introduced throughout the text...|$|E
40|$|The present {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} quality and it´s influence on competitiveness. This thesis {{consists of two}} parts- first part is focused on history and nowadays quality management both in the Czech Republic and word wide and it also explains the related basic terms. The main emphasis is given on the proper attitude to these issues and on the comparison of different cultures. The second part is devoted competitiveness and how to reach it by means of quality factor. Quality {{is divided into two}} sections – the inner quality of the company which can be achieved bythe system of quality (ISO standard, Kaizen, Lean production) and for the quality which the company must ensure to attract the customer, the so- called external quality (transport, design, marketing).

40|$|To {{understand}} the {{whole set of}} positive and null data on the Theta+(1530) -production, we suggest the hypothesis that multiquark hadrons are mainly generated from many-quark states, which emerge either as short-term hadron fluctuations, or as hadron remnants in hard processes. This approach allows us to describe both non-observation of the Theta+ in current null experiments and peculiar features of its production in positive experiments. Further, {{we are able to}} propose new experiments that might be decisive for the problem of the Theta+ existence. Distributions of the Theta+ in such experiments can give important information both on higher Fock components of conventional hadrons and about structure and hadronization properties of hadron remnants produced in hard processes. We also explain that description of multiquark hadrons may require a modified form of the constituent quark model, with quark masses and couplings being intermediate between their values for the familiar constituent quarks and the current ones. Comment: 18 pages. Some changes in the text; experimental suggestions collected in a <b>special</b> <b>subsection,</b> references added and refreshe...|$|E
40|$|AND KEY WORDS The {{purpose of}} my thesis is {{to analyze the}} {{institute}} of criminal informant as a legal instrument {{in the fight against}} organized crime. I introduce the historical background of cooperation between criminals and state on uncovering criminal activities. Then I follow with the analysis of current Czech legislation of cooperating accused and the so far limited cases of its application and also offer a comparative view of the law and its application in United States, Great Britain and Slovakia. The thesis is composed of six chapters. Chapter One is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis: cooperating accused and crown witness. In this chapter I argue that the terms can be used interchangeably In the second chapter I introduce the history of cooperation between criminals and the state. <b>Special</b> <b>subsection</b> deals with the development of Czech legislation on cooperating accused. Chapter Three examines relevant Czech legislation and the limited number of documented cases of application of the institute. Chapter Four offers a comparative view of relevant legislation and approach to decision-making by trial courts in the United States and Great Britain and also the legislation passed in neighboring Slovakia. Chapter Five concentrates on problems resulting from organized crime, [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis examines complex burial behaviors as ritualized responses to changing sociopolitical landscapes {{just prior to}} a warring-states period and emergence of Rome as world power. A multivariate statistical approach investigates skeletal estimations of biological kinship (“biodistance”) {{and its role in}} the burial and social organizational practices of two central Italian Iron Age (1000 - 27 BC) groups: Pentri Samnites from Alfedena Campo Consolino (600 - 400 BC, L’Aquila, Abruzzo) and Pretuzi from Campovalano (750 - 100 BC, Teramo, Abruzzo). Despite missing data and sample imbalances, these are two of the largest, best-preserved, and generally contemporaneous Iron Age series spanning prehistoric, protohistoric, and historic periods. Alfedena Campo Consolino is a <b>special</b> <b>subsection</b> of a broader burial area and Campovalano represents a nearly complete necropolis. Most data from these Iron Age semi-transhumant agropastoralists comes from mortuary rather than settlement contexts. Thus, burial location is a central archaeological theme because of its potential to indicate corporate land ownership, group permanence, and identity. However, burial areas tended to be structured by family lineages and the similar material cultures they contain confound detailed discernment of the social identities encoded within the graves. I test the hypothesis that the mountainous and economically less-incorporated Pentri Samnites at Alfedena Campo Consolino will have stronger associations between biological and burial distances due to greater emphasis on biological kinship organization of the deceased. On the other hand, I expect that the Pretuzi from Campovalano will be more phenotypically variable as a result of broader ideas of kinship due to further economic and social reaches. To test these hypotheses, Mantel tests were used to examine the strength of association between biological similarity and spatial proximity of burials. Also, multidimensional scaling and univariate and multivariate analyses of variance were performed on data subgrouped by burial location, sex, time period, head position, and clothes brooch frequencies. Distribution of widely found funerary items, brooches, were examined in-depth for the potential that they varied spatially with biological patterns of variation as a marker of biological group membership. In general, I think brooches were well-made, distinctive, and highly visible indicators of wearers’ social position and identity. Male faces and cranial bases at Alfedena Campo Consolino and female multivariate tooth row measures at Campovalano produce the most noticeable signals. Because samples differ so greatly in their compositions and sizes, results of this study cannot specify if ACC was organized by biological kinship to a greater degree than CMV. Instead, results are interpreted in terms of the idea that a greater diversity of burial and social organization existed in Iron Age central Italy than previously thought. This research constitutes an important advance in evaluation of the spatial dimension of mortuary practices and social identity formation during an unstable time, and novel biodistance approaches such as those developed in this thesis should be considered as additional lines of evidence for comprehensive mortuary analyses...|$|E
