40|$|This study {{involved}} fabrication of simulated plate fuel elements. Uranium silicide of actual fuel elements {{was replaced with}} yttria. The fabrication stages were otherwise identical. The final cold rolled and/or <b>straightened</b> <b>plates,</b> without stress relief, showed an inverse relationship between bond strength and out of plane residual shear stress (tau(13)). Stress relief of tau(13) was conducted over a range of temperatures/times (200 - 500 degrees C and 15 - 240 min) and led to corresponding improvements in bond strength. Fastest tau(13) relief was obtained through 300 degrees C annealing. Elimination of microscopic shear bands, through recovery and partial recrystallization, was clearly the most effective mechanism of relieving tau(13). (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Regarding {{straightening}} unit as the research object, considered the different of roller spacing, {{a mathematical model}} of intermesh schedule suitable to the 2800 seven-roller strong heavy <b>plate</b> <b>straightening</b> machine was deduced by the geometric method. According to the mathematical model, the intermesh schedules of several specifications of plate were calculated, and the finite element model of straightening process {{was established in the}} finite element analysis software Abaqus. By analysing, it was found that those <b>plates</b> after <b>straightening</b> cannot meet the requirement of flatness, due to the existence of the work hardening. The bending deflection of the last {{straightening unit}} was modified and the new calculation formula of intermesh schedule was obtained. The values of the modified coefficients were determined by the finite element method. The intermesh schedules of other specifications of plate were calculated by the modified calculation formula and then verified it in Abaqus. The simulation results showed that those <b>plates</b> after <b>straightening</b> meet the requirement of flatness. So, the research results provide a theoretical basis for development of a new <b>plate</b> <b>straightening</b> machine and formulation of intermesh schedule...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{supplying}} shielding gases in an alternating manner {{has been developed}} to enhance the efficiency of conventional Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW). However, the available literature on this advanced joining process is very sparse and no cost evaluation {{has been reported to}} date. In simple terms, the new method involves discretely supplying two different shielding gases to the weld pool at pre-determined frequencies which creates a dynamic action within the liquid pool. In order to assess the potential benefits of this new method from a technical and cost perspective, a comparison has been drawn between the standard shielding gas composition of Ar/ 20 %CO 2, which is commonly used in UK and European shipbuilding industries for carbon steels, and a range of four different frequencies alternating between Ar/ 20 %CO 2 and helium. The beneficial effects of supplying the weld shielding gases in an alternating manner were found to provide attractive benefits for the manufacturing community. For example, the present study showed that compared with conventional GMAW, a 17 % reduction in total welding cost was achieved {{in the case of the}} alternating gas method and savings associated with a reduction in the extent of post weld <b>straightening</b> following <b>plate</b> distortion were also identified. Also, the mechanical properties of the alternating case highlighted some marginal improvements in strength and Charpy impact toughness which were attributed to a more refined weld microstructure...|$|R
40|$|The LBR- 5 {{software}} allows optimizing ship structures {{according to}} objectives of higher inertia, less weight and/or lower cost. This last criterion offers {{the choice between}} two approaches of calculation. The first approach {{is based on a}} simplified assessment of the cost in which the total cost is described by rather simple analytical functions which bring into play on the one hand the design variables {{and on the other hand}} empirical parameters. In the second approach, the calculation of the cost is based on data specific to the shipyard. The material cost is analyzed according to the first approach while the cost of the labor considers each relevant operation of the ship building with respect to the LBR- 5 model. A survey of all the tasks was carried out at Aker Yards France, and a thorough study made it possible to develop assessment tools of the labor cost for each operation as functions of the design variables. <b>Plate</b> <b>straightening</b> operations are also considered in this analysis. This paper presents a cost-based optimization study carried out on a large passenger ship structure with more than 600 design variables, by the use of the detailed approach for the cost calculation. The structural model has been formulated on the basis of technical documentation prepared by Aker Yards France. The loads and strength criteria applied on the model are considered according to classification society rules (Bureau Veritas). Results and conclusions of the study are presented. Peer reviewe...|$|R
