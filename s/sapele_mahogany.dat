50|$|Reconstituted stone panels {{with open}} lattice {{patterns}} form {{the framework for}} the geometric stained glass windows, and as with historic Cathedral design, the structure is divided into regular bays. Rather than traditional stone, the main structural frame is of reinforced concrete. The framework is infilled with face brick, except in the sanctuary where marble is used. The building finishes were left unpainted to reduce future maintenance liability and the flooring chosen was durable marble, terrazzo, mosaic and linoleum.Liturgical foci - the altar, baptismal font and holy water fonts - are constructed in solid Botticeno marble. The canopy over the high altar is constructed of edge-grained Oregon Pine with <b>Sapele</b> <b>Mahogany</b> fascias, {{in the form of}} a hyperbolic paraboloid supported on laminated <b>Sapele</b> <b>Mahogany</b> columns.|$|E
50|$|The Modern {{features}} a HH pickup configuration on a carved <b>sapele</b> <b>mahogany</b> {{body with a}} recessed bolt on maple neck, and is available in Satin Black and Natural Mahogany finishes. It is targeted more at those {{in pursuit of a}} T-Shape guitar, but with an alternate layout and pickup configuration.|$|E

5000|$|The Megatar is a fretted {{instrument}} with 12 strings, {{divided in}} two sections of six, where {{one set of}} strings is for bass {{and the other for}} melody. Both sides are normally tuned in fourths intervals. Other tunings and setups are common. The scale length is similar to an electric bass guitar. It uses electronic pickups that should be connected to an amplifier to produce sound. The instruments have two embedded, dual-action truss rods and a stereo 1/4" [...] output. The Megatars are usually made with bolt-on necks. However, from 2007 all new instruments are exclusively [...] "neck-through". All models are either built from light-colored maple and alder or premium dark woods like <b>mahogany,</b> <b>sapele,</b> wenge and rosewood.|$|R
