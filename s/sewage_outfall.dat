25|$|Raw {{effluent}} {{from the}} entire town still travels through the drainage system built in the 1930s, and spews out into the River Avoca untreated via several <b>sewage</b> <b>outfall</b> pipes along the river between the bypass bridge and the Nineteen Arches bridge, {{on both sides of}} the river. The proposed sewage treatment plant was first awarded planning permission in 1993. This was challenged unsuccessfully to An Bord Pleanála, however subsequently no funding arrived from government, and the planning permission was allowed to lapse. A further ten-year planning permission was granted in 1999. Since then it too has been challenged unsuccessfully to An Bord Pleanála. The current situation is that yet another legal challenge has been mounted by the objectors to the plant. Meanwhile, raw human effluence continues to flow untreated into the River Avoca. The Arklow Sea Scout group has started an online petition in favour of the proposed plant.|$|E

Late in the 1980s, the Sanitary District was allowed to discontinue chlorination. Fish soon returned to the Boneyard, after the chlorine block was removed from the Saline Branch.

This paper tests the sensitivity of A. latreillei to sewage discharges in fine-sand communities along the Castellon coast (W. Mediterranean). We analysed variation in tanaid populations between sites at varying distances from <b>sewage</b> <b>outfalls</b> with respect to population density, size distribution, sex ratio and their correlation with different abiotic factors of waste water and sediment. Results showed clearly that A. latreillei populations were affected by the presence of <b>sewage</b> <b>outfalls,</b> {{to such an extent that}} sewage disposal outlets produced a decrease in population density and changes in size spectra.

40|$|Shell {{morphology}} and sculpture, {{population size}} structure, sediment grain size preference, and the reproductive cycle, are described {{for the common}} estuarine mud flat gastropod, Amphibola crenata (Martyn 1784). Snails which occurred near to <b>sewage</b> <b>outfalls</b> in the Avon-Heathcote Estuary, are compared with those which occurred In an area with similar salinity and exposure conditions but isolated from possible effects of sewage. Sediment silt and organic carbon content were higher near to the outfalls. Shell morphology, described by shell dimensions, geometrical parameters of coiling, linear weight relationships and shell deposition patterns, showed {{no significant difference between}} the two areas. A predominantly juvenile population which occurred near to the <b>sewage</b> <b>outfalls</b> was the result of an annual cycle of settlement and sub-sequent population loss. A predominantly adult population occurred in the area unaffected by the outfalls. In laboratory experiments, animals from each area preferred sediment from their own particular area. Size frequency and sculpture distribution showed no regular zonation patterns for other areas of the estuary. Seasonal changes in the ovotestis were not significantly different between animals collected from the two areas. Tissue levels of heavy metals in A. crenata collected from near to the <b>sewage</b> <b>outfalls</b> were lower per unit tissue dry weight but higher in total metal per individual than in those from the other area. Tissue and sediment levels of metals were relatively low in both areas compared with levels reported in studies of polluted conditions. Isolated areas of elevated metal levels occurred in the Avon River. Exceptionally long survival times for A. crenata exposed to copper(ii) ion concentrations in the laboratory, are attributed to pulmonary respiration, the operculum, and high mucous production. Salinities below 8 % seawater and increase in temperature affected the toxicity of copper to adults. Veliger larvae were sensitive to much lower concentrations of ionic copper(ii) (0. 5 ppm) than those which affected egg development (5 ppm) or survival of adults (2. 5 ppm). The size distribution of A. crenata near to the <b>sewage</b> <b>outfalls</b> does not seem to be a result of the presence of toxic materials in the sewage...|$|R

40|$|Concerns {{over the}} fate of {{pharmaceuticals}} and personal care products (PPCP) within the environment have been growing with the advent of more precise analytical methods. The discharge of municipal wastewater has been identified as a significant source of these contaminants, particularly where wastewater treatment is minimal. Here we present results from a comprehensive monitoring regime located around Victoria, BC, Canada. Samples were collected between 2009 and 2016 {{from a variety of sources}} including marine water, sediment and biota adjacent to two major untreated <b>sewage</b> <b>outfalls,</b> as well as the sewage itself. PPCP concentrations within the untreated sewage were high, and the sediment surrounding the outfalls showed corresponding contamination. However, this contamination dropped quickly with distance from the outfall such that by 800 m distance most PPCPs were below detection limits. Tissue samples of resident Northern Horse mussels (Modiolus modiolus) collected adjacent to one of the major <b>sewage</b> <b>outfalls</b> showed high single sample concentrations of the antimicrobial triclosan (317 ng g− 1 dry weight), the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (176 ng g− 1 dry weight), as well as the antidepressant sertraline (84. 1 ng g− 1 dry weight). Reference stations from around the region showed very low concentrations of contamination with almost all PPCP concentrations being below detection limits. Within the sewage, concentrations were largely stable overtime, with the exception of triclosan and triclocarban which both showed declines over the study period...|$|R
