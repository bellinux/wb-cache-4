50|$|PWM drives are {{inherently}} associated with high-frequency common-mode voltages and currents which may cause trouble with motor bearings. When these high-frequency voltages find {{a path to}} earth through a bearing, transfer of metal or electrical discharge machining (EDM) sparking occurs between the bearing's ball and the bearing's race. Over time, EDM-based <b>sparking</b> causes <b>erosion</b> in the bearing race {{that can be seen}} as a fluting pattern. In large motors, the stray capacitance of the windings provides paths for high-frequency currents that pass through the motor shaft ends, leading to a circulating type of bearing current. Poor grounding of motor stators can lead to shaft-to-ground bearing currents. Small motors with poorly grounded driven equipment are susceptible to high-frequency bearing currents.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In electro {{discharge}} machining (EDM) the metal removal occurs from the erosive effects of high frequency <b>sparks.</b> Consequently the <b>erosion</b> rate depends on spark energy sparking frequency and the factors affecting them. However the experimental results are highly random and sometimes unexpected. Material erosion rate and surface roughness were analysed for the effect of important factors like pulse parameters (voltage current, ontime and offtime), polarity and work material. Taguchi method of experiment planning with orthogonal arrays was adopted to analyse the anomalies observed in the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the Electro {{discharge}} machining process. EDM has been an important manufacturing process for the tool, mould, and dies industries for several decades. The process is finding an increasing industrial use owing to its ability to produce geometrically complex shapes as well as its ability to machine hard materials that are extremely difficult using conventional processes. Further, in spite of the recent technical advancement, the conventional machining processes are inadequate to produce complex geometries shapes in hard and temperature resistant alloy and die steels. Keeping these requirements in mind, EDM a non conventional machining methods have been developed.

The mechanisms explains two kinds of nanosized particles: particles of several tens and even hundreds of nanometers are formed due to explosion of molten droplets while the smaller particles having in turn a different structure and morphology are formed as a result of condensation of evaporated constituents under different conditions. The latter have the composition usually different from the target composition while the composition of the former is very close to the target (master alloy) composition.|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} {{economic}} treatment of {{coronary heart disease}} in South Africa and the popularity of coronary stent implantation as an effective treatment increases. Stent implants {{have had to be}} imported to date with significant cost involved. The project in hand therefore deals with the evaluation of the possibilities of economical local manufacture of a coronary stent. The design of several coronary stents currently in use was carefully analysed and the results of clinical application described in the literature were reviewed. After evaluating the patent situation, a suitable design concept was chosen, based primarily on the availability of manufacturing equipment. The design concept of choice is the balloon expandable slotted tube variety. Stents of this most popular slotted tube design are usually laser cut out of a tube with good results. Since there was no suitable laser cutting equipment in use in South Africa, it was undertaken to manufacture stent prototypes by <b>spark</b> <b>erosion</b> to establish the general suitability of the method for stent manufacturing. The initial design was adjusted several times to the manufacturing process and suitable machine parameters were evaluated. For comparison a stent of a similar design was laser cut by an established European manufacturer.

40|$|The global {{trend towards}} energy {{efficiency}} and environmental sustainability has generated a strong demand for clean energy technologies. Among the many energy solutions, the work in this dissertation contributes to two strategic goals: the reduction of fuel consumption in the transportation sector, and the increase of domestic wind power capacity. The key barriers to achieving these goals are materials challenges. Automobiles can be made more efficient by thermoelectric conversion of waste heat from the engine into electricity {{that can be used}} to power electrical components in the vehicle. Vehicles can forego petroleum fuel altogether by using electric or hybrid motors. Unfortunately, the conversion efficiency of current thermoelectric technology is too low to be considered economically feasible, and the permanent magnets used in electric vehicle motors and wind turbine generators require critical rare-earth elements that are economically unstable (often referred to as the "rare- earth crisis"). In order to combat these challenges, a "spark erosion" technique was utilized for producing nanoparticles that improve thermoelectric efficiency and contribute to the development of electromotors that do not require rare-earths. In Chapter 2 of this dissertation, I describe the utilization of <b>spark</b> <b>erosion</b> for producing high-quality thermoelectric nanoparticles at a remarkably high rate and with enhanced thermoelectric properties. The technique was employed to synthesize p-type bismuth- antimony telluride (BST) and n-type skutterudite nanoparticles, using a relatively small laboratory apparatus, with low energy consumption. The compacted BST nanocomposite samples made from these nanoparticles exhibit a well-defined, 20 - 50 nm size nanograin microstructure, and show an enhanced Figure of merit, ZT, of 1. 36 at 360 K due to a reduction in lattice thermal conductivity. The skutterudite nanocomposites also show reduced thermal conductivity but still require enhancement in the thermoelectric power factor. Such a technique is essential for providing inexpensive, oxidation-free nanoparticles required for fabricating high performance thermoelectric devices for power generation from waste heat, and for refrigeration. We have investigated the <b>spark</b> <b>erosion</b> of MnBi, a promising rare-earth-free permanent magnet, and have determined that <b>spark</b> <b>erosion</b> provides the best approach for producing MnBi particles. The low-temperature phase of MnBi (LTP-MnBi) is an attractive rare-earth free permanent magnet material due it its high uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which produces an unusually high coercivity at the elevated temperatures required for motor and generators. However, due to the peritectic Mn-Bi phase diagram and the slow interdiffusion of Mn and Bi below the 350 °C phase change temperature, bulk samples of LTP-MnBi with high saturation magnetization (MS) have been difficult to achieve. In Chapter 3, we describe the successful formation of high- purity bulk LTP-MnBi ingots and <b>spark</b> <b>erosion</b> of this material to produce single-domain particles of MnBi at an unprecedented rate. The bulk ingots have MS > 90 wt % of LTP-MnBi, and are formed by chill-casting and by vacuum- annealing of arc-melted ingots. The as-prepared powder then consists of amorphous, crystalline, and superparamagnetic particles, mostly as porous aggregates. The major fraction of the powder consists of 20 - 30 nm particles. A short anneal crystallizes the amorphous particles producing a high moment, albeit with HC of only a few kOe. If lightly milled, the agglomerates are broken up and yield an HC of 1 T and a maximum energy product of 3. 0 MGOe. The particles can be further engineered through milling, annealing, and/or solution processing in order to produce unique properties that hold promise to achieving the first bulk permanent magnet that utilizes the ex...|$|E
