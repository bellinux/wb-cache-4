60|$|All methods I tried. Sometimes I {{would send}} them forth {{accompanied}} by a curt business note of the take-it-or-leave-it order. At other times I would attach to it pathetic appeals for its consideration. Sometimes I would give value to it, stating that the price was five guineas and requesting that the cheque should be crossed; at other times seek to tickle editorial cupidity by offering this, my first contribution to their pages, for nothing--my sample packet, so to speak, sent gratis, one trial surely sufficient. Now I would write sarcastically, enclosing together with the <b>stamped</b> <b>envelope</b> for return a brutally penned note of rejection. Or I would write frankly, explaining elaborately that I was a beginner, and asking to be told my faults--if any.|$|E

60|$|It was {{two o'clock}} {{when she came}} to herself and called for the police. The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim {{in the middle of the}} lane, {{incredibly}} mangled. The stick with which the deed had been done, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter--the other, without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and a gold watch were found upon the victim; but no cards or papers, except a sealed and <b>stamped</b> <b>envelope,</b> which he had been probably carrying to the post, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.|$|E
6000|$|Thursday, January 29.--Devoted {{the main}} part of the day, from 11 to 3.30 o'clock, to Armory-square hospital; went pretty {{thoroughly}} through Wards F, G, H, and I--some fifty cases in each ward. In Ward H supplied the men throughout with writing paper and a <b>stamped</b> <b>envelope</b> each, also some cheerful reading matter; distributed in small portions, about half of it in this ward, to proper subjects, a large jar of first-rate preserved berries; also other small gifts. In Wards G, H, and I, found several cases I thought good subjects for small sums of money, which I furnished in each case. The poor wounded men often come up [...] "dead broke," [...] and it helps their spirits to have even the small sum I give them. My paper and envelopes all gone, but distributed a good lot of amusing reading matter; also, as I thought judicious, tobacco, oranges, apples, etc. Some very interesting cases in Ward I: Charles Miller, Bed No. 19, Company D, Fifty-third Pennsylvania, is only sixteen years of age, very bright, courageous boy, left leg amputated below the knee; next bed below him, young lad very sick--gave the two each appropriate gifts; in the bed above also amputation of the left leg--gave him a part of a jar of raspberries; Bed No. 1, this ward, gave a small sum also; also to a soldier on crutches, sitting on his bed near.|$|E
