5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is a <b>simple</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> control the concentration and ionic strength. The concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties, including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased ionic strength reduces {{the thickness of the}} electrical double layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E

25|$|In physics, Gauss's law for gravity, {{also known}} as Gauss's flux theorem for gravity, is a law of physics that is {{essentially}} equivalent to Newton's law of universal gravitation. It is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss. Although Gauss's law for gravity is equivalent to Newton's law, there are many situations where Gauss's law for gravity offers a more convenient and <b>simple</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> do a calculation than Newton's law.|$|E
25|$|One <b>simple</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{reduce the}} heat of {{decanting}} is to open valves slowly. With sensitive valves, such as needle valves, the gas can slowly be allowed through the valve so that the pressure increase is slow on the low-pressure side. The pipe-work, joints and valves in the blending system should be designed to minimize sharp bends and sudden constrictions. Sometimes 360-degree loops {{are present in the}} pipe-work to reduce vibration.|$|E

A wood or metal plate is then placed over the box, and then the two are flipped over and the core segment falls out of the core box. The core segment is then baked or hardened. Multiple core {{segments}} are then hot glued together or attached by some other means. Any rough spots are filed or sanded down. Finally, the core is lightly coated with graphite, silica, or mica to give a smoother surface finish and greater resistance to heat.|$|E

25|$|The LOD score (logarithm (base 10) of odds), {{developed}} by Newton Morton, is a statistical test {{often used for}} linkage analysis in human, animal, and plant populations. The LOD score compares the likelihood of obtaining the test data if the two loci are indeed linked, to the likelihood of observing the same data purely by chance. Positive LOD scores favour the presence of linkage, whereas negative LOD scores indicate that linkage is less likely. Computerised LOD score analysis is a <b>simple</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> analyse complex family pedigrees {{in order to determine}} the linkage between Mendelian traits (or between a trait and a marker, or two markers).|$|E
25|$|One major {{drawback}} of the Levins {{model is}} that it is deterministic, whereas the fundamental metapopulation processes are stochastic. Metapopulations are particularly useful when discussing species in disturbed habitats, and the viability of their populations, i.e., how likely they are to become extinct in a given time interval. The Levins model cannot address this issue. A <b>simple</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> extend the Levins' model to incorporate space and stochastic considerations is by using the contact process. Simple modifications to this model can also incorporate for patch dynamics. At a given percolation threshold, habitat fragmentation effects take place in these configurations predicting more drastic extinction thresholds.|$|E
25|$|Python's {{property}} descriptors are similar, {{but come}} with a tradeoff in the development process. If one begins in Python by using a publicly exposed instance variable, and later changes the implementation to use a private instance variable exposed through a property descriptor, code internal to the class {{may need to be}} adjusted to use the private variable rather than the public property. Ruby’s design forces all instance variables to be private, but also provides a <b>simple</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> declare set and get methods. This is in keeping with the idea that in Ruby, one never directly accesses the internal members of a class from outside the class; rather, one passes a message to the class and receives a response.|$|E
