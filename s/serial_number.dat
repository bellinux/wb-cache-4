5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} milling. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E
5|$|Descendants of Wyatt Earp's cousins {{assert that}} Earp carried the pistol {{featured}} in the auction and while in Tombstone, although the grips, barrel, and cylinder have been replaced. Only the frame is original, and its <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> has been filed off. However, X-ray testing showed an original <b>serial</b> <b>number,</b> 5686, which matches a batch of revolvers purchased by the U.S. Army in 1874.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{developed}} as a method to detect flaws or irregularities in magnetic materials, magnetic particle inspection {{can be used on}} firearms to visualize the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> underneath the obliterated area. When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a magnetic field. The irregularities in the metal, in this case the <b>serial</b> <b>number,</b> cause the field to deform. When a solution of ferrous particles is added to the weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and will build up in the area. If fluorescent particles are added to the ferrous solution, ultraviolet light {{can be used to make}} it easier to visualize any recovered <b>serial</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{are often}} used in network protocols. However, most {{sequence}} numbers in computer protocols are limited to a fixed number of bits, and will wrap around after a sufficiently many numbers have been allocated. Thus, recently allocated <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> may duplicate very old <b>serial</b> <b>numbers,</b> but not other recently allocated <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b> To avoid ambiguity with these non-unique numbers, [...] "Serial Number Arithmetic", defines special rules for calculations involving these kinds of <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The main flying unit {{here is the}} 3rd Infantry Battalion flying two Bell 206Bs (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 4396 and 4447), two Schweizer S-300Cs (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 1337 and 1339), and two Cessna U-17Bs (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 1454 and 1618).|$|R
50|$|These <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{ignore the}} leading zeros {{at the start}} of the <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{celebration of}} the Millennium 2000, five million $2 bills were printed with the Millennium 2000 logo {{replacing}} the prefix of the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> normally found in other notes under general circulation.|$|E
5|$|One tank is {{displayed}} at the Institute of Military Technology in Titusville, Florida. Unrestored condition with a LVT-3 Turret installed. The Hull <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> is 49.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} involved was a 50-seat Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet CRJ-100ER, <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 7472. Manufactured in Canada in late 2000, it {{was delivered}} to the airline on January 30, 2001.|$|E
50|$|<b>Serial</b> <b>numbers</b> in the 1500s {{were built}} by Rearwin. <b>Serial</b> <b>numbers</b> in the 1600s are Commonwealth 185 Skyrangers.|$|R
50|$|Early issues did {{not have}} <b>serial</b> <b>numbers,</b> and were issued without regard for inflation. Later issues did {{initially}} feature <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b> Towards {{the end of the}} war, as more money was needed to pay military personnel, notes were issued without <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> once more.|$|R
5000|$|USA-built Peavey Wolfgangs {{typically}} had <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{that started}} with [...] "91" [...] followed by six more digits. Late-run USA Wolfgangs had <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{that started with}} [...] "50" [...] or [...] "51". A very few prototype models had <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> that started with [...] "1". Though Peavey Wolfgang owners have often sought to find a corroboration in the <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> of their guitars and {{the year in which}} each was built (similar to the system Gibson uses), there was no such information contained in the <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b> There was also no code specific to Custom Shop models.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} locomotives (in <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> order) {{built by}} Rogers, before ALCO's {{acquisition of the}} company, have been preserved. Where multiple railroads and road numbers are listed, they are given in chronological order for the locomotives; all locations are in the United States unless noted.|$|E
5|$|YF-23A PAV-1, Air Force <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 87-0800, {{registration}} number N231YF, {{was on display}} as of 2015 in the Research and Development hangar of the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|A Hawker Hurricane Mk IV {{that flew}} {{as part of}} No. 351 Squadron is {{on display at the}} Museum of Aviation in Belgrade. This aircraft, <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 20925, was {{manufactured}} in 1943, and remained in operation until it was withdrawn from service on 18 August 1952.|$|E
50|$|Confirmation {{is based}} on {{existing}} <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b> Many <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> still unconfirmed so actual quantity is more than recorded here.|$|R
5000|$|... "Sigma-Martin USA" [...] guitars {{built in}} 1981 and 1982 only, had {{specifically}} assigned <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> ranging from 900,001 to 902,908 (2,907 in total.) These <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> are documented by C.F. Martin & Co. {{and to this}} day remain the only Sigma related <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> that are publicly available.|$|R
50|$|<b>Serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{identify}} otherwise identical individual {{units with}} many, obvious uses. <b>Serial</b> <b>numbers</b> are a deterrent against theft and counterfeit products, {{as they can}} be recorded, and stolen or otherwise irregular goods can be identified. Banknotes and other transferable documents of value bear <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> to assist in preventing counterfeiting and tracing stolen ones.|$|R
5|$|All {{standard}} production Type 26s have checked pattern grip panels {{as well as}} original finished characteristics. Most {{standard production}} revolvers have a <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> that is between 1,000 and 58,900. Many of the standard production models suffered from extreme wear because of the long military service the revolvers served.|$|E
5|$|Assigned the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 1440, the XSO2U-1 flew for {{the first}} time, as a landplane, in July 1939; its first flight as a {{seaplane}} took place that December. Flight testing of the SO2U showed that the aircraft lacked directional stability; {{the addition of a}} large ventral fin, connecting the rear of the float to the tail, helped to cure the problem.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944 {{the prisoners}} had counterfeited {{the reverse of}} the dollar, and the obverse by January 1945. Twenty samples of the $100 note were produced—without the <b>serial</b> <b>number,</b> whose {{algorithm}} was still being examined—and shown to Himmler and banking experts. The standard of engraving and printing was considered excellent, although the paper used was technically inferior to the genuine notes.|$|E
50|$|C-12F: U.S. Air Force {{transport}} version. Based on the King Air A200CF (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> BP-52 through BP-63) and the King Air B200C (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> BP-64 and up).|$|R
50|$|Most of the Fender Japan <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> do {{not follow}} this format. Instead, several have <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{beginning}} with A B or C followed by six numerals, e.g. AXXXXXX or BXXXXXX.|$|R
50|$|MMC <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{are nine}} digits long, as {{required}} for a passport book, and padded with leading zeros. As of December 2011, about 134,000 <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> had been used (presuming sequential assignment).|$|R
5|$|On 4 July 1943, while {{returning}} from the Middle East, Sikorski perished, together with his daughter, his Chief of Staff, Tadeusz Klimecki, and seven others, when his aircraft, a Consolidated Liberator II, <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> AL523, crashed into the sea 16seconds after takeoff from Gibraltar Airport at 23:07hours.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{recovery}} of the Akutan Zero, technical information from three other downed Zeros was available to the Allies. One Zero (<b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 5349), piloted by Hajime Toyoshima, crashed on Melville Island in Australia following the bombing of Darwin. The Zero was heavily damaged, and Toyoshima became Australia's first Japanese prisoner of the Pacific war. Another Zero, piloted by Yoshimitsu Maeda, crashed near Cape Rodney, New Guinea. The team sent to recover the plane erred when they chopped off the wings, severing the wing spars and rendering the hulk unflyable. The third came from China, where Gerhard Neumann was able to reconstruct a working Zero. He used a partly intact Zero (<b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 3372) that had landed in Chinese territory, repaired with salvaged pieces from other downed Zeros. However, bad conditions and the long delivery time from China prevented Neumann's Zero from reaching the United States for testing until after the {{recovery of the}} Akutan Zero.|$|E
5|$|Progress M1-5, {{which had}} {{originally}} been built to resupply and refuel either Mir or the International Space Station, was selected to perform the deorbit manoeuvre. Its mission earned it the nickname Hearse. It was a Progress-M1 11F615A55 spacecraft, with the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 254. An uninhabited area of the southern Pacific Ocean was selected for the station to be deorbited into, as had been done with five earlier Salyut spacecraft.|$|E
5000|$|The 5th Infantry Division {{operates}} the following aviation assets {{from a small}} airfield within the army reserve at Nakhon Si Thammarat (not at the airport): two Bell 206B-3s (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 4382 and 4427), three Schweizer TH-300Cs (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 1371, 1372, and 1373) and two Maule MX-7s (<b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> 114 and 115). A detachment of helicopters can be found here from the Air Mobility Companies based at Lopburi.|$|R
50|$|Right handed Angel rifles were <b>serial</b> <b>numbered</b> {{starting}} with AA and then three digits. Left handed models had <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> commencing with an LH prefix and the Hawk Angel had a prefix of HA.|$|R
50|$|The {{complete}} {{revision of the}} <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> applied to the whole inventory was only completed by 1958. Even then, some aircraft coming from the Naval Aviation, never received correct <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> within this system.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey appointed Vasey to the 6th Division as his Assistant Adjutant General and Quartermaster General (AA), the senior logistics staff officer of the division. He received the Second AIF <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> VX9. Vasey embarked for Palestine as commander of the advance party of the division in December 1939.|$|E
5|$|The $500 {{denomination}} {{was first}} issued with red {{as the main}} colour in 2001. The 2003-dated versions were brown. It {{was followed by the}} $1000 denomination on 2 October 2003, the sole difference between the two variants of the $1000 notes (Pick no. 12) only being the typeface of the <b>serial</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Cessna O-1 Bird Dog that Major Buang {{landed on}} the USS Midway is now {{on display at the}} National Museum of Naval Aviation at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. Lady Ace 09, CH-46 <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 154803, is now on display at the Flying Leatherneck Aviation Museum in San Diego, California.|$|E
50|$|Unlike Siebe Gorman, who {{had only}} one series of <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> for their diving helmets, except for the last {{productions}} (which were meant most probably for the Russian Navy), Heinke used many series of <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> for them.|$|R
50|$|For some reason, the Halberstadt-built D-series fighters bore no marked IdFlieg-issued {{military}} <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> {{anywhere on}} their exteriors. The licence-built Aviatik and Hannover-constructed {{examples of the}} Halberstadt D-series fighters usually had IdFlieg-issued <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> on their rear fuselage sides.|$|R
50|$|The units bear five-digit <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
