40|$|Abstract. In {{dissimilar}} material joints, failure often occurs {{along the}} interface between two materials due to stress singularity. Stress distribution and its concentration depend on materials and geometry of the junction as the stress concentration depends on grain orientation and its stiffness matrix of neighboring grains in micro-scale.

40|$|When the four-week-old woody stem of Prunus jamasakura {{was grown}} under {{simulated}} microgravity condition on a three-dimensional clinostat, it bent at growth, and width of its secondary xylem decreased {{due to the}} reduction of fiber cell numbers and a smaller microfibril angle in the secondary cell wall, as reported in our previous paper.

In this study, morphological changes of the tissues and cells were microscopically observed. Disorder was found in the concentric structure of tissues that organize the stem. The radial arrangement of the cells was also disturbed in the secondary xylem, and in the secondary phloem secondary cell walls of the bast fiber cells were undeveloped.

40|$|In {{human and}} animal running spring-like leg be-havior is found. In a spring-mass model, running proves to be self-stable in terms of {{external}} pertur-bations or variations in leg properties (e. g. landing angle). However, biological limbs are not made of springs but, rather, consist of segments where spring-like behavior can be localized at joint level. Here, we use a two-segment leg model to investigate the effects of leg compliance originating from joint level on run-ning stability. Due to leg geometry a nonlinear relationship be-tween leg force and leg compression is found. In con-trast to the linear leg spring, the segmented leg is ca-pable of reducing the minimum speed for self-stable running from 3. 5 m/s in the spring-mass model to 1. 5 m/s for almost <b>straight</b> <b>joint</b> configurations which is below the preferred transition speed from human walk-ing to running (≈ 2 m/s). At moderate speeds the tolerated range of landing angle is largely increased (17 degrees at 5 m/s) com-pared to the linear leg spring model (2 degrees). How-ever, for fast running an increase of joint stiffness is required to compensate the mechanical disadvan-tage of larger leg compression. This could be achieved by nonlinear springs enhancing joint stiffness in fast running...|$|E

40|$|The {{operation}} of power transmission systems requires accurate current ratings for each component within the system. With improvements in computational power, {{the application of}} modelling techniques such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has become viable for rating calculations. The influence of modelling assumptions implemented in FEA models for directly buried and force-cooled cable circuits has been previously quantified, but without direct consideration of the joint bay. To provide a rating which covers all potential hotspots requires the ability to model the temperature distribution through a joint bay. With the eventual aim of creating 3 D FEA models for water cooled joint bays, this paper reports the development of FEA models for rating joints. By extension of modelling techniques developed previously for rating high voltage cables, a steady state 2 D axi-symmetric FEA heat transfer model for a 400 kV cable joint has been developed. This allows examination of {{the sensitivity of the}} model to variations in the model parameters.

Half a kilometer further along, as the road begins to climb the still gentle slopes of {{the south side of}} the valley, it passes a tumulus tomb about 100 m south of the road. The tumulus was cleaned out by the Aphrodisias Museum in 1982. Latitude: 37. 41. 21. 84 Longitude: 28. 41. 32. 46 Elevation: 522 mAxis: 271 mDimensions: Chamber: H: 2. 09 m; W: 1. 98 m; L: 2. 54 m ** Antechamber: H: 2. 09 m; W: 1. 25 m; L: 1. 6 – 1. 7 m ** Dromos: H: uncertain; W: 1. 05 m; L: uncertainDescription: Chamber. The floor, walls, and ceiling of the chamber, antechamber, and dromos are all built out of limestone blocks, with the exception of one of the ceiling blocks of the chamber, which is of schist. As in other tombs, the walls of the chamber rest on the floor. The north, east, and south walls (Th: 0. 4 – 0. 5 m) are built up in three courses of large blocks (H of the bottom course as measured in the north wall: 0. 79 m; H of the middle and top courses: 0. 65 m). In the bottom course, the back and north walls are monoliths, as is the top course of the back wall. In the bottom course, the south wall is bonded into (passes behind) the back wall, and the back wall is bonded into the north wall; in the middle course, the back wall is bonded into both side walls; and in the top course, the two side walls are bonded into the back wall. All the blocks were apparently clamped together. In two places, the clamps survive; everywhere else they have been gouged out by tomb robbers. The best-preserved clamp, in the bottom course of the south wall, is an iron pi-clamp (L: 0. 17 m; D: 0. 04 m; Th: 0. 015 m) set in copious amounts of lead. Couches composed of monolithic schist slabs (W: 0. 67 m; Th: 0. 10 m) were slotted into the back and south walls on top of the bottom course. As in the Yazır tumulus, the back couch was closed off by a front slab (Th: 0. 07 m; H: uncertain) resting on top of the couch and slotted into both side walls; a shallow cutting in the south doorjamb (H: 0. 42 m; W: 0. 06 m) suggests that the couch on the south wall had a similar front panel. The top of this cutting has a socket (H: 0. 9 m; D: 0. 8 m), perhaps for a rail from which the front panel was suspended (if, as seems likely, it was made of wood). As in other tumulus tombs, the east wall of the chamber contains the doorway (H: 1. 50 m; W: 0. 73 m), situated off center so as to accommodate the south couch. It consists of two monolithic doorjambs (W: 0. 71 and 0. 28 m) supporting a lintel course (H: 0. 47 m). Reveals around the inner face of the doorway (W on the sides: 0. 13 m; W at the top: 0. 06 m) show that it was closed by a fitted doorplug. The doorframe was built up against the side walls of the chamber, which is roofed by three monolithic ceiling slabs. ** Antechamber and Dromos. The antechamber was built up against the chamber. It is roughly centered on the doorway, and its masonry is similar to that of the chamber, although the blocks are less long and less finely trimmed and joined. The ceiling (Th: 0. 4 m) is level with that of the chamber. The north wall of the antechamber ends in a <b>straight</b> <b>joint</b> at the east, at which point the wall of the dromos abuts on it. The wall of the dromos is parallel with that of the antechamber but shifted 0. 13 m to the south. It is built of roughly coursed limestone rubble masonry. On the south, the wall of the dromos is continuous with that of the antechamber. The upper sections of the dromos walls were apparently rebuilt by the Aphrodisias Museum after the tomb was cleaned out in 1982, and a monolithic limestone ceiling slab was placed on top of them. The original height of the ceiling of the dromos is uncertain. Finds: The field to the NE of this tomb was full of tiles and pottery and one visible limestone block in the field, with others around the edge.

L: 1. 1 m ** Diameter of mound: c. 20 - 25 mDescription: Chamber. The chamber is built entirely out of a {{conglomerate}} rock of varying fineness; in places, it resembles sandstone, in others, terrazzo or coarse concrete. The {{first part of the}} chamber to be laid was the floor, consisting of slabs 0. 2 m thick. The walls of the chamber were then built up in five courses, the lowest resting on top of the floor. This lowest course served as a kind of orthostat (H: 0. 68 m) supporting couches (W: 0. 71 m) socketed into the back (west) and south walls of the chamber. The couches were monolithic slabs (Th: 0. 10 m). The couch on the back wall was supported on the back and both sides by the bottom course of the chamber walls; the couch on the south wall, by contrast,was simply cantilevered out from the south wall itself. Perhaps it was also supported from the bottom by, for example, legs at the corners, of which no trace remains. But it is also possible, since the couch slabs presumably projected through most or all the thickness of the wall (at least 0. 4 m, as revealed by the robber's holes), that additional supports were not necessary. Both couches have been hacked away by the tomb robbers. ** Above the level of the couches, the courses of the walls become progressively less high (from 0. 42 m to 0. 35 m, 0. 34 m, and 0. 30 m), except for the fifth and final course (H: 0. 36 m), which belongs to a kind of ceiling zone. Incorporated into this course are two transverse ceiling beams; in addition, all four sides of the chamber step inward 0. 02 m. The ceiling beams are 0. 35 m thick and so are essentially square in section. They are undecorated except for simple reveals (W: 0. 03 m; D: 0. 02 m) running along the long edges on their undersides. The west ceiling beam is 0. 59 m from the west wall, the east beam the same distance from the east wall, but the two beams are 0. 67 m apart. ** On top of the ceiling beams are three monolithic ceiling slabs. In one place where the edge of a ceiling slab has been chipped away, {{the upper part of the}} east ceiling beam has been revealed, showing that, rather than being flat on top, the beam has a notched profile, with the ceiling slab resting on a shallow ledge 0. 07 m wide. The top of the central part of the beam is not visible. This detail would presumably have served to strengthen the ceiling beam, by making it thicker along its longitudinal axis and by ensuring that the weight of the ceiling slabs, which were quite adequately supported by the side walls of the chamber, did not fall along this line. If this interpretation is correct, then the beams were essentially decorative and nonstructural. ** The east wall of the chamber, which contains the doorway, is built differently from the other walls. The doorjambs are monolithic slabs (Th: 0. 43 m). The door (W: 0. 95 m) has been placed off center so as to accommodate a couch on the south wall. The north jamb (W: 0. 22 m) is bonded into the bottom course of the north wall of the chamber but abuts on the upper two courses, and so is L-shaped in east and west elevation. On the exterior, the north jamb exhibits a simple reveal (W: 0. 35 m; D: 0. 6 m), presumably for socketing in a doorplug. The south jamb (W: 0. 71 m) is entirely buried and so cannot be examined. ** Antechamber and Dromos. The antechamber and dromos are essentially a single architectural unit, a corridor (W: 1. 60 m) giving access to the chamber. The only difference between them is that the antechamber was built, at least on its north side, of ashlar masonry and roofed by a single ceiling slab (the south side is not exposed), while in the dromos, the construction of the walls shifts to unmortared rubble (schist and quartz), and there was no roof. ** The north wall of the antechamber is in fact simply the continuation of the north wall of the chamber, which runs behind the north jamb of the doorway (except at the level of the bottom course). The main purpose of continuing the ashlar masonry beyond the doorway was presumably to support the ceiling slab, so as to protect the entrance to the chamber during construction of the tumulus. It is interesting to note that the masonry of the north wall projects irregularly beyond the edge of this ceiling slab (Th: 0. 30 m). There was no need to end the ashlar section of the wall neatly here; on the contrary, the rubble-masonry continuation of the wall in the dromos was strengthened by being bonded into the ashlar masonry, rather than abutting on a <b>straight</b> <b>joint.</b> That the dromos was unroofed is shown by the fact that its rubble masonry continues above the level of the ceiling slab. As noted, the south side of the antechamber is not exposed. It must be built differently from the north side, inasmuch as it does not continue the same line as the south wall of the chamber. Presumably it abuts on the south doorjamb. It is worth noting that the antechamber and dromos are not centered on the doorway. Perhaps the builders felt that if the south wall were symmetrical with respect to the doorway with the north wall, the resulting corridor (W: 1. 39 m) would be impracticably narrow. ** The floor, if there was one, of the antechamber and dromos has not been exposed...|$|E

Yielding capacity of this support is realized in fric-tional joints, which due to their geometry can be divided to <b>straight</b> and arch <b>joints.</b> Occurring in steel frames arch frictional joints are characterized with more complex loading state than <b>straight</b> <b>joints</b> used in friction props. In the article, there is presented an analysis of the state of stress and de-formation of the arch frictional joint, which was carried out on the model of these joints using finite element method. The scope of the analysis included two methods of loading of arch frictional joint, namely its axial compression and bending. In both cases, joints were loaded dynamically with the impact of freely falling mass. Arch joints with and without passive pressure were submitted to an axial compression. Physical model of the frictional joint was developed {{on the basis of a}} system ap-plied during the stand tests. To solve mathematical model an explicit integration method was used. As a result of analyses carried out, temporal courses of force transmitted through the frictional joint, and displacements of section sliding down were determined. On the basis of the temporal courses, depen-dences between maximum value of force transmitted through the frictional joint and the height from which the impact mass falls down were determined. Distributions of reduced stresses in elements of frictional joint were also determined and the state of deformation was described. In order to emphasize the difference between straight and arch frictional joints, also an analysis of internal forces in arch fric-tional joint depending on its geometrical parameters without and with passive pressure was presented. 1...|$|R
40|$|We study numerically a {{lattice model}} of semiflexible homopolymers with nearest {{neighbor}} attraction and energetic preference for <b>straight</b> <b>joints</b> between bonded monomers. For this {{we use a}} new algorithm, the "Pruned-Enriched Rosenbluth Method" (PERM). It is very efficient both for relatively open configurations at high temperatures and for compact and frozen-in low-T states. This allows us to study in detail the phase diagram {{as a function of}} nn-attraction epsilon and stiffness x. It shows a theta-collapse line with a transition from open coils to molten compact globules (large epsilon) and a freezing transition toward a state with orientational global order (large stiffness x). Qualitatively this is similar to a recently studied mean field theory (Doniach et al. (1996), J. Chem. Phys. 105, 1601), but there are important differences. In contrast to the mean field theory, the theta-temperature increases with stiffness x. The freezing temperature increases even faster, and reaches the theta-line at a finite value of x. For even stiffer chains, the freezing transition takes place directly without the formation of an intermediate globule state. Although being in contrast with mean filed theory, the latter has been conjectured already by Doniach et al. on the basis of low statistics Monte Carlo simulations.

Jack planes are about 12-15 inches long, and the blade can have either a slightly curved edge for smoothing stock, or a <b>straight</b> edge for <b>jointing</b> stock.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} has a 1975-built new church used for Russian Orthodox services; {{this is an}} old church that is either a later enlargement of an original church built probably in 1843 or it is wholly a later 1800s replacement. The old church reflects the influence of traditional three-part Russian Orthodox ecclesiastical architecture in America expressed in the style of a log cabin. Balanced in the center, it is divided into three parts: vestibule, nave, and altar chamber. Each section is built by squared logs with corner dovetailing and <b>straight</b> butt <b>joints</b> at points where the logs are shorter. A 1979 survey suggested that no other extant log church in Alaska (and perhaps nowhere else in all of North America) of its age possessed comparable construction.|$|R

This paper focuses on modeling of power cable joints. A cascaded transmission line model is proposed for 10 kV oil-filled PILC-PILC <b>straight</b> power cable <b>joint</b> in thefrequency range of 300 kHz- 800 MHz. It can be applied to interpret PD signal transmission and reflection behavior in power cable connections. The model is verified by S-parameter measurement...|$|R
