25|$|Biosafety level 2 is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> {{involving}} {{agents of}} moderate potential hazard to personnel and the environment. This includes various microbes that cause mild disease to humans, or {{are difficult to}} contract via aerosol in a lab setting. Examples include Hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pathogenic Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Plasmodium falciparum, and Toxoplasma gondii.|$|E
25|$|Biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) is <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> with well-characterized agents {{which do}} not cause disease in healthy humans. In general, these agents should pose minimal {{potential}} hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. At this level, precautions are limited relative to other levels. Laboratory personnel must wash their hands upon entering and exiting the lab. Research with these agents may be performed on standard open laboratory benches {{without the use of}} special containment equipment. However, eating and drinking are generally prohibited in laboratory areas. Potentially infectious material must be decontaminated before disposal, either by adding an appropriate disinfectant, or by packaging for decontamination elsewhere. Personal protective equipment is only required for circumstances where personnel might be exposed to hazardous material. BSL-1 laboratories must have a door which can be locked to limit access to the lab, however it is not necessary for BSL-1 labs to be isolated from the general building.|$|E

[...] These are primarily used by Port Security Units for force protection in naval support areas abroad, as well as, ports of embarkation/debarkation in expeditionary areas.

2500|$|Hunt seat or Hunter classes {{judge the}} {{movement}} and the form of horses <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> over fences. A typical show hunter division would include classes over fences as well as [...] "Hunter under Saddle" [...] or [...] "flat" [...] classes (sometimes called [...] "hack" [...] classes), in which the horse is judged on its performance, manners and movement without having to jump. Hunters have a long, flat-kneed trot, sometimes called [...] "daisy cutter" [...] movement, a phrase suggesting a good hunter could slice daisies in a field when it reaches its stride out. The over fences classes in show hunter competition are judged on {{the form of the}} horse, its manners and the smoothness of the course. A horse with good jumping form snaps its knees up and jumps with a good bascule. It should also be able to canter or gallop with control while having a stride long enough to make a proper number of strides over a given distance between fences. Hunter classes differ from jumper classes, in which they are not timed, and equitation classes, in which the rider's performance is the focus. Hunter style is based on fox hunting, so jumps in the hunter division are usually more natural colors than the jumps in a jumper division.|$|E

50|$|Rata Die is {{somewhat}} similar to Julian Dates (JD), {{in that the}} values are plain real numbers that increase by 1 each day.The systems differ principally in that JD takes on a particular value at a particular absolute time, and is the same in all contexts, whereas R.D. values may be relative to timezone, depending on the implementation. This makes R.D. more <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> on calendar dates, whereas JD is more <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> on time per se. The systems also differ trivially by having different epochs: R.D. is 1 at midnight (00:00) local time on January 1, AD 1 in the proleptic Gregorian calendar, JD is 0 at noon (12:00) Universal Time on January 1, 4713 BC in the proleptic Julian calendar, and the REXX count of days begins with 0 at midnight (00:00) local time on January 1, AD 1 in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.|$|E
