T. rubrum cannot be distinguished from other dermatophytes in this direct examination. It can distinguished in vitro from other dermatophytes by means of characteristic micromorphology in culture, usually consisting of small, tear-drop-shaped microconidia, {{as well as its}} usual blood-red colony reverse pigmentation on most growth media. In addition, the Bromocresol purple (BCP) milk <b>solid</b> <b>glucose</b> agar test can be used to distinguish it. Different Trichophyton species release different amounts of ammonium ion, altering the pH of this medium. In this test, medium supporting T. rubrum remains sky blue, indicating neutral pH, until 7 to 10 days after inoculation. In primary outgrowth on Sabouraud dextrose agar with cycloheximide and antibacterials, contaminating organisms may cause confusion, as T. rubrum colonies deprived of glucose by competing contaminants may grow without forming the species' distinctive red pigment. Both antibiotic-resistant bacteria and saprotrophic fungi may outcompete T. rubrum for glucose if they contaminate the sample. Red pigment production can be restored in such contaminated isolates using casamino acids erythritol albumin agar (CEA). T. rubrum cultures can be isolated on both cycloheximide-containing media and cycloheximide-free media. The latter are conventionally used for the detection of nail infections caused by non-dermatophytes such as Neoscytalidium dimidiatum. A skin test is ineffective in diagnosing active infection and often yields false negative results.|$|E

Supersaturated glucose solutions in 2 -methyl 2 -butanol showed a high stability even {{in the presence of}} solid crystalline glucose. During the reaction, the dissolved glucose concentration falls as the reaction proceeds, before recovering later as more of the excess solid dissolves. However, the ester synthesis rate continues to fall even after glucose concentration reaches its minimum, so glucose dissolution rate limitation is not responsible for the synthesis rate decline.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{survival}} of bacteria largely depends on signaling systems that coordinate cell responses to environmental cues. Previous {{studies on the}} two-component ColRS signal system in Pseudomonas putida revealed a peculiar subpopulation lysis phenotype of colR mutant that grows on <b>solid</b> <b>glucose</b> medium. Here, we aimed to clarify {{the reasons for the}} lysis of bacteria. Results We present evidence that the lysis defect of P. putida colR mutant is linked to hunger response. A subpopulation prone to lysis was located in the periphery of bacterial cultures growing on solid medium. Cell lysis was observed in glucose-limiting, but not in glucose-rich conditions. Furthermore, lysis was also alleviated by exhaustion of glucose from the medium which was evidenced by a lower lysis of central cells compared to peripheral ones. Thus, lysis takes place at a certain glucose concentration range that most probably provides bacteria a hunger signal. An analysis of membrane protein pattern revealed several hunger-induced changes in the bacterial outer membrane: at glucose limitation the amount of OprB 1 channel protein was significantly increased whereas that of OprE was decreased. Hunger-induced up-regulation of OprB 1 correlated in space and time with the lysis of the colR mutant, indicating that hunger response is detrimental to the colR- deficient bacteria. The amount of OprB 1 is controlled post-transcriptionally and derepression of OprB 1 in glucose-limiting medium depends at least partly on the carbon catabolite regulator protein Crc. The essentiality of ColR in hunger response can be bypassed by reducing the amount of certain outer membrane proteins. In addition to depletion of OprB 1, the lysis defect of colR mutant can be suppressed by the down-regulation of OprF levels and the hindering of SecB-dependent protein secretion. Conclusions We show that Pseudomonas putida growing on <b>solid</b> <b>glucose</b> medium adapts to glucose limitation through up-regulation of the sugar channel protein OprB 1 that probably allows enhanced acquisition of a limiting nutrient. However, to survive such hunger response bacteria need signalling by the ColRS system. Hence, the ColRS system should be considered a safety factor in hunger response that ensures the welfare of the cell membrane during the increased expression of certain membrane proteins. </p...|$|E

In this study cocaine, heroin, and MDMA were analyzed using near-IR (785 nm excitation) micro-Raman spectroscopy. Narcotics were dispersed in solid dilutants of different concentrations by weight. The dilutants investigated were foodstuffs (flour, baby milk formula), sugars (glucose, lactose, maltose, mannitol), and inorganic materials (Talc powder, NaHCO 3, MgSO 4. 7 H 2 O). In most cases it was possible to detect the presence of drugs at levels down to ~ 10 % by weight. The detection sensitivity of the Raman technique was found to be dependent on a number of factors such as the scattering cross-sections of drug and dilutant, fluorescence of matrix or drug, complexity of dilutant Raman spectrum, and spectrometer resolution.

40|$|Abstract Background We have {{recently}} found that Pseudomonas putida deficient in ColRS two-component system {{is sensitive to}} phenol and displays a serious defect on <b>solid</b> <b>glucose</b> medium where subpopulation of bacteria lyses. The latter phenotype is significantly enhanced {{by the presence of}} phenol in growth medium. Here, we focused on identification of factors affecting phenol tolerance of the colR -deficient P. putida. Results By using transposon mutagenesis approach we identified a set of phenol-tolerant derivatives of colR -deficient strain. Surprisingly, half of independent phenol tolerant clones possessed miniTn 5 insertion in the ttgABC operon. However, though inactivation of TtgABC efflux pump significantly enhanced phenol tolerance, it did not affect phenol-enhanced autolysis of the colR mutant on glucose medium indicating that phenol- and glucose-caused stresses experienced by the colR -deficient P. putida are not coupled. Inactivation of TtgABC pump significantly increased the phenol tolerance of the wild-type P. putida as well. Comparison of phenol tolerance of growing versus starving bacteria revealed that both ColRS and TtgABC systems affect phenol tolerance only under growth conditions and not under starvation. Flow cytometry analysis showed that phenol strongly inhibited cell division and to some extent also caused cell membrane permeabilization to propidium iodide. Single cell analysis of populations of the ttgC- and colRttgC- deficient strains revealed that their membrane permeabilization by phenol resembles that of the wild-type and the colR mutant, respectively. However, cell division of P. putida with inactivated TtgABC pump seemed to be less sensitive to phenol than that of the parental strain. At the same time, cell division appeared to be more inhibited in the colR -mutant strain than in the wild-type P. putida. Conclusions ColRS signal system and TtgABC efflux pump are involved in the phenol tolerance of P. putida. However, as they affect phenol tolerance of growing bacteria only, this indicates that they participate in the regulation of processes which are active during the growth and/or cell division. Single cell analysis data indicated that the cell division step of cell cycle is particularly sensitive to the toxic effect of phenol and its inhibition can be considered as an adaptive response under conditions of phenol stress. </p...|$|E

Negative test results occur for the urease test, hair perforation test, and casamino acids erythritol albumin agar. In conjunction to physiological tests, contact with cattle should also be used as a criterion due to the zoophilic and occupational nature of the disease. Otherwise, misdiagnosis as pyoderma or bacterial folliculitis can occur, with the prescribed antibacterial treatment having no effect. Indeed, one study found that people infected with T. verrucosum had to visit a physician on average of 2.5 times, with 25 days elapsing, before a proper diagnosis was obtained. This may lead to an underestimation of the true number of cases, as many people will recover from the disease before obtaining a proper diagnosis. Looking at the stratum corneum under a microscope may also aid in diagnosis, which is done by adding 10% KOH solution and a Periodic acid-Schiff stain.
