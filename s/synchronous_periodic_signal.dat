Based on the normal form approach and the center manifold theory, we derive some formula to determine the direction of Hopf bifurcation and stability of the Hopf bifurcated <b>synchronous</b> <b>periodic</b> orbits, phase-locked oscillatory waves, standing waves, mirror-reflecting waves, and so on. In addition, under general conditions, such a network has a slowly oscillatory <b>synchronous</b> <b>periodic</b> solution which is completely characterized by a scalar delay differential equation.

Two different desynchronization mechanisms of a <b>synchronous</b> <b>periodic</b> attractor of the coupled subsystem have been found: one via period doubling bifurcation {{and the other}} via transcritical bifurcation. Following a period doubling route to chaos, the periodic orbit of the response subsystem is chaotic after the desynchronization. We show that our results are useful for understanding loss of chaotic synchronization in these unidirectionally coupled systems. PACS numbers: 05. 45. -e Keywords: I...|$|R

In our separation method, a mixture of speeches is approximated with <b>periodic</b> <b>signals</b> with time-varying amplitude. The decomposition with the <b>periodic</b> <b>signal</b> model is performed under a sparsity penalty. Due to the sparsity penalty, {{a segment of the}} speech mixture is decomposed into <b>periodic</b> <b>signals,</b> each of them is a component of the individual speaker. For speech separation, we introduce the clustering using a K-means algorithm for the set of the <b>periodic</b> <b>signals.</b> After the clustering, each cluster is assigned to its corresponding speaker using codebooks that contain spectral features of the speakers. In experiments, comparison with MaxVQ that performs separation on frequency spectrum domain is demonstrated.

40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} of machines {{is very important}} in maintenance of factories. By monitoring the condition of machines in real time, maintenances can be planned better and unnecessary loss of production and break down of machines can be avoided. Frequency-domain methods provide efficient means for such monitoring. The methods can be used in recognizing <b>periodic</b> <b>signals</b> from data thus providing valuable information of the condition and possible error sources. The aim of the thesis is to review the frequency-domain methods used in literature, and then investigate their performance in recognizing <b>periodic</b> <b>signals</b> from data. Five frequency-domain methods were chosen from the literature and applied in studies. The chosen methods were autocorrelation, fast Fourier transform (FFT), short time Fourier transform (STFT) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The methods were applied to real-world data obtained from an earth crushing facility. Two experiment setups were implemented to compare the different methods with each other. The results showed that autocorrelation and FFT were very good at finding the <b>periodic</b> <b>signal</b> from the data. The noise and the length of the data affected FFT more than autocorrelation, but the results were still good. The problem with autocorrelation and FFT was that information {{on the nature of the}} <b>periodic</b> <b>signal</b> was lost. FFT also had no time information of the <b>periodic</b> <b>signal.</b> STFT and CWT provided very good information on the nature of the <b>periodic</b> <b>signal.</b> The results showed that CWT was a bit weaker than autocorrelation and FFT at finding the <b>periodic</b> <b>signal,</b> but the noise did not affect the results so much. STFT was always the weakest of the methods at finding the <b>periodic</b> <b>signal,</b> but the results were still good. The experiments showed that STFT has very good frequency resolution. The frequency resoultion of CWT was worse and the stronger frequencies drowned the other frequencies, but all the frequencies could still be found from the data. Autocorrelation and FFT are very easy and fast methods to use compared to STFT and CWT, but STFT and CWT provide better information on the periodic content of the data. All the methods have pros and cons. STFT is the best method to use at finding continuous <b>periodic</b> <b>signals</b> from data because the time domain content is preserved in the transformation and the frequency resolution is good. CWT is the best method to use at finding impulsive <b>periodic</b> <b>signals</b> from data because the time domain content is preserved and the impulsive signals are clear and easy to find from the transform. The results of the thesis can be used to select a frequency-domain method for a specific application to perform frequency-domain analysis and condition monitoring...|$|R

40|$|Grid-connected {{inverters}} (GCI) {{are widely}} used to feed power from renewable energy distributed generators into smarter grids. Repetitive control (RC) enables such inverters to inject high quality fundamental-frequency sinusoidal currents into the grid. However, digital RC which can get approximately zero tracking error of any <b>periodic</b> <b>signal</b> with known integer period in steady-state, cannot exactly track or reject <b>periodic</b> <b>signal</b> of frequency variations.
