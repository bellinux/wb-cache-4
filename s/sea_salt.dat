5|$|Salt is {{processed}} from salt mines, {{and by the}} evaporation of seawater (<b>sea</b> <b>salt)</b> and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products. Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt, only about 6% is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> and table salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. <b>Sea</b> <b>salt</b> and freshly mined salt (much {{of which is}} <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E
5|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>salt</b> was {{extracted}} {{during the}} Roman period, {{and a string}} of settlements were set up along the Polden Hills. Some possible settlement sites are also known in the Draycott and Cheddar Moors and around Highbridge. The discovery at Shapwick of 9,238silver Roman coins, the second largest hoard ever found from the Roman Empire included coins dated from as early as 31–30 BC up until 224 AD. The hoard also contained two rare coins which had not been discovered in Britain before, and the largest number of silver denarii ever found in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Simple {{versions}} are prepared by slicing vegetables and drying them, without any cooking involved.

Vegetable chips may be flavored with spices such as salt, <b>sea</b> <b>salt,</b> pepper, cajun spice, curry, allspice, chipotle powder, sweet or smoked paprika, adobo seasoning, dried chives and many others. Mass-produced varieties may contain food preservatives or monosodium glutamate. Vegetable chips can be homemade using various recipes and preparation processes.|$|E
5|$|Europa has the smoothest {{surface of}} any known solid {{object in the}} Solar System. The {{apparent}} youth and smoothness of the surface {{have led to the}} hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below. <b>Sea</b> <b>salt</b> from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers.|$|E
5|$|In Guam, {{the threat}} of Typhoon Isa {{postponed}} a flight from Guam to Honolulu, Hawaii for 48hours. The flight was the last in , which was a multimillion-dollar humanitarian effort to transport more than 6,600Kurds in a political asylum to the mainland of the United States. The threat of the typhoon also canceled {{the first round of}} the Omega Tour golf event, which was the second professional golf tournament in the island's history. Though Typhoon Isa passed well to the south of Guam, one of its outer rainbands stalled across the island, which dropped heavy rainfall of 15–25cm (6–10in) across the island. The rainfall was welcome as it occurred during the dry season, and largely contributed to rainfall at the Guam International Airport being 45% above normal from the period between January through April. The rainband also produced wind gusts that reached 86km/h (53mph) at the island's Naval Air Station; the winds resulted in sporadic power outages across the island. The typhoon caused some light damage to buildings, particularly on the south side of the island. The combination of winds and <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> caused damage to the island's tomato, okra, cucumber, and soy bean crops.|$|E

When a woman was to have her first child, her husband started raising a pig for the ‘Aha‘aina Mawaewae feast that was celebrated {{for the birth of}} a child. Besides the pig, mullet, shrimp, crab, seaweeds and taro leaves were required for the feast. The modern name for such feasts, lū‘au, was not used until 1856, replacing the Hawaiian words ‘aha‘aina and pā‘ina. The name lū‘au came from the name of a food always served at a ‘aha‘aina — young taro tops baked with coconut milk and chicken or octopus.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of atmospheric particulates that can act as CCN. The particles may be composed of dust or clay, soot or black carbon from grassland or forest fires, <b>sea</b> <b>salt</b> from ocean wave spray, soot from factory smokestacks or internal combustion engines, sulfate from volcanic activity, phytoplankton or the oxidation of sulfur dioxide and secondary organic matter formed by the oxidation of volatile organic compounds. The ability of these different types of particles to form cloud droplets varies according to their size and also their exact composition, as the hygroscopic properties of these different constituents are very different. Sulfate and <b>sea</b> <b>salt,</b> for instance, readily absorb water whereas soot, organic carbon and mineral particles do not. This is made even more {{complicated by the fact that}} many of the chemical species may be mixed within the particles (in particular the sulfate and organic carbon). Additionally, while some particles (such as soot and minerals) do not make very good CCN, they do act as ice nuclei in colder parts of the atmosphere.|$|E
