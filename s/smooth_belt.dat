60|$|In summer, Long Lake has {{no great}} beauty and shrinks, leaving a white saline crust on its wide margin of sun-baked mud, {{but it is}} a picturesque stretch of water when the snow melts in spring and the {{reflections}} of the birches quiver on the <b>smooth</b> <b>belt</b> along its windward edge. Farther out, the shadows of flying clouds chase each other across the flashing surface. Two or three leaky canoes generally lie among the trees, and in the afternoon Charnock dragged one down, and helping Sadie on board, paddled up the lake.|$|E
5000|$|Cooke {{signed to}} RCA Victor in 1960 but {{his first two}} singles on the major label - [...] "Teenage Sonata" [...] and [...] "You Understand Me" [...] - failed to {{register}} on the charts. Meanwhile, John Siamas, co-founder of Keen Records, discovered the [...] "demo" [...] recording of [...] "Wonderful World" [...] among unreleased Cooke recordings. Keen released [...] "Wonderful World" [...] in competition with RCA's issue of [...] "You Understand Me" [...] in the same week. [...] "Wonderful World" [...] quickly became Cooke's best-performing single since his first hit [...] "You Send Me," [...] reaching number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the magazine's Hot R&B Sides chart. Billboard reviewed the single upon its release, giving it four stars and writing, [...] "Moderate rocker gets a <b>smooth</b> <b>belt</b> from Sam Cooke in his usual, salable style." ...|$|E
50|$|The weapon feeds {{from the}} left side from open-link, metal {{ammunition}} belts: either the American disintegrating M13 belt (NATO standard) or the segmented German DM1 belt, whose 50-round sections can be linked through a cartridge. In order to adapt the weapon to feed from one belt type to the other, several components of the feed mechanism need to be reconfigured since the position of the feed tray's cartridge stop and pawl angles in the top cover are different. The MAG features a pawl-type feeding mechanism that continues to move the feed link during both the rearward and forward cycles of the reciprocating bolt carrier, producing a <b>smooth</b> <b>belt</b> flow. The feeding mechanism's three pawls are actuated by a roller connected to the bolt carrier. The feed channel rail, feed link, both feed slides and the feed tray are chrome plated. The top cover body is an anodized aluminum casting. In the infantry assault role, the weapon can be fitted with a sheet metal container that houses a 50-round belt and is attached to {{the left side of the}} receiver.|$|E
60|$|They sped {{past the}} man upon {{the bank and}} Agatha watched the {{crouching}} figure in the canoe. The craft was a short distance in front of, but outside, theirs, {{and she could see}} the danger of her being smashed or swamped. It was plain that the only safe way down was through the slack along the bank, but the man made no effort to reach this <b>smoother</b> <b>belt.</b> He let the paddle trail in the water while the canoe rocked among the angry waves. His rashness fascinated Agatha and she could not look away, although she knew she might see him drown.|$|R
5000|$|Belting leather is a {{full-grain leather}} {{originally}} used in driving pulley belts and other machinery. It is {{found on the}} surface of briefcases, portfolios, and wallets, and can be identified by its thick, firm feel and <b>smooth</b> finish. <b>Belting</b> leather is generally a heavy-weight of full-grain, vegetable-tanned leather.|$|R
5000|$|The Ironwood City Hall was a two-story, rectangular, vernacular Richardsonian {{structure}} with an exterior of tan brick with <b>smooth</b> brownstone <b>belt</b> cornices on {{a foundation of}} rough cut brown sandstone. [...] The hip roof was covered in steel, and an eighty-foot-high tower, originally capped with a pagoda-roofed open turret, was located on one corner. There were several ground-floor entrances, including a tower entrance, a double door for fire equipment, and entrances {{to the police station}} and library. The windows were rectangular and symmetrically arranged, with decorative windows in wall dormers on the upper story. Decorative trim, including gable pilasters and finials, chimney caps and cornices, appeared bulbuous and weighty.|$|R
50|$|It was {{designed}} by Topeka architect George Ropes. It is a two-story-with-basement red brick building with a 110 x 60 ft plan and height almost 65 ft. Its foundation is a native limestone wall, separated from brick above by a <b>smooth</b> cut stone <b>belt</b> course. A second belt course circles the building at level of the second story's window sills.|$|R
2500|$|The Tollund Man lay [...] {{away from}} firm ground, buried under {{approximately}} [...] of peat, his body {{arranged in a}} fetal position. He wore a pointed skin cap made of sheepskin and wool, fastened securely under his chin by a hide thong. There was a <b>smooth</b> hide <b>belt</b> around his waist. Additionally, the corpse had a noose made of plaited animal hide drawn tight around the neck and trailing down his back. Other than these, the body was naked. His hair was cropped so short as to be almost entirely hidden by his cap. There was short stubble (1mm length) on his chin and upper lip, suggesting {{that he had not}} shaved on the day of his death.|$|R
40|$|A {{proposed}} experimental {{setup for}} study and {{demonstration of the}} pressure distribution and load capacity of hydrodynamic bearings was developed. Various conceptual designs for producing thin full film lubrication conditions and enabling gap geometry control and pressure and force measurements were produced and assessed. Relative motion for the interacting bearing surfaces was found promising to be achieved by a <b>smooth</b> rotating <b>belt.</b> A simple height control arrangement for the stationary surface is also found to be facilitating the gap control between the two surfaces. Alternative direct and indirect techniques for measuring pressure and force were pointed out. Topology and dimensions of the proposed design were suggested {{as a basis for}} a physical setup realization. A great deal of research work is being carried out on hydrdynamic bearings to improve their frictional eficeincy. All the research work that has been carried out is on the hydrodynamic bearings, which is prone to various nolinearities. The thesis is a venture to genrate a simple experimental setup that may help to conduct the experimentation in simple and precise manner. C/O Gaurav Bhupati, Minervagen 20. Â¨, Karlskrona, -Sweden.

5000|$|The usual {{failure modes}} of timing belts are either {{stripped}} teeth (which leaves a <b>smooth</b> section of <b>belt</b> where the drive cog will slip) or delamination and unraveling of the fiber cores. Breakage of the belt, {{because of the}} nature of the high tensile fibers, is uncommon. [...] Often overlooked, debris and dirt that mix with oil and grease can slowly wear at the belt and materials advancing the wear process, causing premature belt failure. Correct belt tension is critical - too loose and the belt will whip, too tight and it will whine and put excess strain on the bearings of the cogs. In either case belt life will be drastically shortened. Aside from the belt itself, also common is a failure of the tensioner, and/or the various gear and idler bearings, causing the belt to derail.|$|R
