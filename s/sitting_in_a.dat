5|$|Spider-Gwen also {{stars in}} a team-up with the {{alternate}} Spider-Man-themed characters from the second volume of Spider-Verse in a series titled Web Warriors, a name that was coined by Peter Parker from the Ultimate Spider-Man TV series during the original Spider-Verse. In 2016, the character starred alongside Miles Morales in a crossover storyline titled <b>Sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Tree where she gets romantically involved with Miles.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for {{it led to}} Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pool of mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet {{for as long as}} the current was maintained.|$|E

5|$|An {{investigation}} found several shortcomings in the airline's operating procedures, in particular lack of proper cockpit communication and mutual {{control of the}} descent and approach plans. This was in part caused by the airline electing to not follow the Sterile Cockpit Rule and that a passenger was <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cockpit jump seat during the flight. The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot training in the airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed shortcomings in the airline's operations and internal control.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with {{was how to}} deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a gasket material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.|$|E
5|$|At the motel, Lila and Sam meet Norman. Sam distracts him by {{striking}} up {{a conversation}} while Lila sneaks up to the house. When Sam tells Norman they've come to question his mother, he knocks Sam out and rushes to the house. Lila sees Norman approaching and hides by going down steps {{that lead to the}} fruit cellar. There she finds Mrs. Bates <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chair. Lila turns her around and discovers that she is in fact a mummified corpse. Lila screams as Norman runs into the cellar, holding a chef's knife and wearing his mother's clothes and a wig. Before Norman can attack Lila, Sam, having regained consciousness, subdues him.|$|E

5|$|Five police officers, {{who volunteered}} {{to carry out the}} execution, were each paid $300. The {{shooters}} used identical Winchester Model 94 rifles. One prison official selected each rifle at random from a table and handed them to another prison official <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small room, out of sight. The second prison official would then load the rifle, and return it to the table. Four of the rifles were loaded with live ammunition. One was secretly loaded with a wax bullet so that none of the officers would be certain that they fired a deadly shot. The non-lethal cartridge was tested to ensure that the report and recoil was difficult to distinguish from a real cartridge.|$|E
5|$|Series 4 {{began on}} 21 September 1996 with the {{introduction}} of new presenters Zoe Ball and Jamie Theakston and with them came an array of new features. One such item was called Cloud 9 which replaced the former Famous For Five Minutes. <b>Sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> den surrounded by sparkles, pink feather boas and harps, 'Zoe would ring up an unsuspecting viewer who had been nominated by their friend or family and make their lifelong dream or ambition come true. The following week's Cloud 9 would then show how that person got on as the segment would be filmed in the week. Cloud 9 also used an edited version of Dreams (The Developed Arrested Mix) by Gabrielle as its theme tune.|$|E
5|$|The album's cover was, like {{several other}} Pink Floyd albums, {{designed}} by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. It {{consists of a}} photograph of a man <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tree which has been taken out of focus to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector, and liked the visual effect when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did not want to make the cover particularly good as The Dark Side of the Moon would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it was given proper consideration like any other Floyd album.|$|E

5|$|Two statues {{erected in}} the 19th century {{have since been}} removed. One of Edward Jenner, pioneer of the {{smallpox}} vaccine, {{was set up in}} the south-west corner of the square in 1858, next to that of Napier. Sculpted by William Calder Marshall, it showed Jenner <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chair in a relaxed pose, and was inaugurated at a ceremony presided over by Prince Albert. It was moved to Kensington Gardens in 1862. The other, of General Charles George Gordon by Hamo Thornycroft, was erected on an 18-foot high pedestal between the fountains in 1888. It was removed in 1943 and re-sited on the Victoria Embankment ten years later.|$|E
5|$|Vidyadhari is the {{daughter}} of Vijaya Varma, the king of Thejavathi or Tejavati. His minister wants the princess to marry his son but she refuses. Annoyed, the minister sets out to find another potential husband for Vidhyadhari. In the forest, the minister finds an illiterate cowman <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tree and cutting into the branch on which he is sitting. The minister persuades the cowman to come to the palace and has Vidhyadhari marry him. When Vidhyadhari realises she has been cheated, and is married to a farmhand, she prays to the goddess Kali for a remedy. Kali appears before her, names her husband Kalidas and endows him with phenomenal literary talents.|$|E
5|$|A set of {{fourteen}} redesigned Major Arcana tarot cards, {{based on the}} Rider-Waite deck, were commissioned by the singer for the album's artwork. The cards depict band members in surrealistic tableau. Each card was reinterpreted to reflect the iconography of the album's lyrical content: The Fool is stepping off a cliff, with grainy images of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a JFK campaign poster in the background; The Emperor, with prosthetic legs, is <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wheelchair clutching a rifle {{in front of an}} American flag; Justice weighs the Bible against the brain on his balance scale. The album's inner sleeve contains these three images, along with a further nine: The Magician, The High Priestess, The Hierophant, The Hermit, Death, The Devil, The Tower, The Star and The World. The cover itself represents The Hanged Man.|$|E

5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. It opens with Hamasaki watching her previous music videos on several television screens. <b>Sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small room, she exits it and finds {{a large amount of}} fans and paparazzi bombarding her; scenes interspersed through the main plot feature her looking towards a mirror. Following the first chorus, Hamasaki is shown riding through Tokyo city, including her appearance at a recording studio singing the song, and on top of a skyscraper at night. The frames subsequently re-appear throughout the visual, with it ending with a blurry shot of Hamasaki looking away from the mirror, and the TV screens from the first shot displaying the logo of Avex Trax. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016). It was additionally used as the theme for Japanese television show Semi Double (1999).|$|E
5|$|Many {{years after}} the event, the Kentish {{antiquarian}} J. Meadows Cooper related that while <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pub {{on the outskirts of}} Margate on Boxing Day 1855 he had encountered a party carrying a hooden horse that entered the building. Another local resident, Mrs. Edward Tomlin, later related that as a child she had lived at a house named Updown that was near to Margate, and that she remembered the hooden horse visiting them at Christmas time during the 1850s and up until 1865. Maylam's researches also found recollections of a hooden horse which had appeared in Herne and Swalecliffe but which been discontinued in the 1860s, another that was active from Wingate Farm House in Harbledown during the 1850s, and one that had been active at Evington but which had ceased by the 1860s. He found another based at Lower Hardres which had been active from at least the least the 1850s under the leadership of Henry Brazier; it was subsequently taken over by his son John, until the tradition ended locally in 1892.|$|E
