The SSRT setup in salt could be realized and tests could be conducted successfully. No clear evidence for an accelerated failure of samples tested in salt compared to samples tested in air could be found on Alloy 347 Nb.

The dual loop approach can reduce the levelized cost of electricity of a parabolic trough solar power plant. The capital expenditures are increased for such a system.

Sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and sulfite (SO 32 -) were not detected in MSS or RS. However, sulfate (SO 42 -) content significantly decreased in RS (29, 878. 15 ～ 36, 097. 45 ppm) compared to that in MSS (35, 601. 65 ppm). ORP was 181. 15 mV in MSS, and 58. 55 mV in RS 1. Moisture content was 9. 34 % in MSS and 0. 00 % in RS with increased NaCl (94. 77 ～ 95. 77 %). Moisture and NaCl contents showed no significant difference in RS. Insoluble and sandy residues were higher in RS than in MSS, whereas Ca and K showed no significant difference. Mg and Cl contents were higher in RS than in MSS.

40|$|Doenjang {{samples were}} {{prepared}} in triplicate and their microbial abundance, bacterial communities, and metabolites throughout fermentation were analyzed {{to investigate the}} functional properties of microorganisms in doenjang. Viable bacterial cells were approximately three orders of magnitude higher than fungal cells, suggesting that bacteria are more responsible for doenjang fermentation. Pyrosequencing and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy were applied {{for the analysis of}} bacterial communities and metabolites, respectively. Bacterial community analysis based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences revealed that doenjang samples included Bacillus, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Oceanobacillus, and Tetragenococcus. These genera were found either in doenjang-meju or <b>solar</b> <b>salts,</b> but not in both, suggesting two separate sources of bacteria. Bacillus and Enterococcus were dominant genera during the fermentation, but their abundances were not associated with metabolite changes, suggesting that they may not be major players in doenjang fermentation. Tetragenococcus was dominant in 108 day-doenjang samples, when lactate, acetate, putrescine, and tyramine increased quickly as glucose and fructose decreased, indicating that Tetragenococcus might be primarily responsible for organic acid and biogenic amine production. Lactobacillus was identified as a dominant group from the 179 -day samples, associated with the increase of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the decrease of galactose, indicating a potential role for this genus as a major GABA producer during fermentation. The results of this study clarified the functional properties of major bacterial communities in the doenjang fermentation process, contributing to the production of safe and high-quality doenjang...|$|R
