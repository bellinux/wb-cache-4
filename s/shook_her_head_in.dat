60|$|His sister {{laughed in}} her turn, but <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>in</b> the {{confidence}} of conjugal affection.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Fitzgerald <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> {{a manner}} which bespoke both her apprehensions and her filial regard.|$|E
60|$|Ruth <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> {{spite of}} herself, the {{kindness}} of Carol's tone brought the tears to her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! fine {{things are}} of little account {{when there is}} no one to see them," [...] said Mrs. Arden, <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> commiseration.|$|R
6000|$|... "What makes <b>her</b> <b>shake</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> that way?" [...] said my wife, apprehensively, as she {{observed}} the interesting beast making sundry demonstrations with her horns. [...] "I hope she's gentle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Brooks, how naughty of you," [...] she exclaimed, <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> mock reproach. [...] "Why, {{the play}} begins at 8:15, {{and it is}} eight o'clock already. Have you had dinner?" ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> disapproval, but {{the next}} moment he saw her gazing {{steadily}} at the opera-glasses again.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Crupp <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> such a {{determined}} manner, that I had not {{an inch of}} vantage-ground left.|$|E

60|$|Smith-Oldwick lay {{in such a}} {{position}} {{that he could see}} nearly the entire expanse of meadow and the aeroplane a short distance away. Usanga was talking to the girl who was <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> vehement negatives.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' {{sang the}} landlady, slowly <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> supreme sarcasm, 'it sounds very pretty, doesn't it? But you see we don't believe {{a word of}} it, {{and how are you}} going to prove it?' She smiled nastily.|$|R
60|$|But {{she only}} smiled and, <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> a {{fascinating}} {{way that was}} peculiar to her, remarked that I could not deceive her as I did the Kaffirs. After this the solid Kaatje brought the food and we breakfasted very heartily, or at least I did.|$|R
60|$|She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> silence. Rutherford sat down, {{his chin}} resting in his hands. She came across to him, and {{smoothed}} his hair.|$|E
60|$|By and by Mrs. Nairn tapped at {{the door}} and smiled rather broadly when she came in; then she <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> reproach.|$|E

60|$|Saxon visioned the picture, and <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slowly <b>in</b> a {{reaction}} of regret.|$|R
6000|$|... "No cruel--plenty forgiven--" [...] {{returned}} Wah-ta-Wah, stamping {{her little}} {{foot on the}} stony strand, and <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> a way to show how completely feminine feeling, {{in one of its}} aspects, had gotten the better of feminine feeling in another. [...] "I tell you, Serpent brave; he go home, this time, with four,--yes--two scalp." ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Something <b>in</b> <b>her</b> protested {{against this}} too public {{advertisement}} of their love.|$|R
60|$|Joan <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> one stride Kells {{reached her}} and swung her {{spinning}} before him. The physical violence acted strangely upon Joan--roused her rage.|$|E
60|$|At each {{repetition}} of the word she <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> his face. She was adorable. Gavin's arms--but they met on nothing. She had run away.|$|E
60|$|Maud blushed to the eyes; but {{the habit}} {{and the love}} of truth were so strong in her, that she <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> the negative.|$|E
60|$|Lucy did {{not exactly}} understand, but she <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> gravely <b>in</b> general dissent to Ned's view.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{if it were}} so! It {{would be}} no more than a thin threadbare cloak over a woman's {{shivering}} shoulders.

[...] She looked at him with her eyes flooded with tears, but she could only <b>shake</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> sign that it was impossible.|$|R
60|$|His wife <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> but <b>in</b> {{a strangely}} quiet fashion, and, sitting down, took up her {{knitting}} again.|$|R

6000|$|... “I know. Even to tears,” I said provokingly. But she wasn’t provoked, {{she only}} <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> {{negation}} (which was absurd) and pursued {{the trend of}} her spoken thoughts.|$|E
60|$|As Lizzie Hexam <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> {{giving this}} reply and as her glance sought the fire, {{there was a}} quiet {{resolution}} in her folded hands, not lost on Bella's bright eyes.|$|E
60|$|She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> and <b>in</b> {{a little}} while he fell asleep, she still holding his hand, and {{soothing}} him.|$|R
60|$|She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> pulled <b>in</b> the mare, who was {{impatient}} {{to be off}} for home, and glanced significantly at the lengthening shadows.|$|R

6000|$|She <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> mere mild despair. [...] "'Loyalty' {{again is}} exquisite. The tact of men has a charm quite its own. And you're rather good," [...] she continued, [...] "as men go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Does it feel good?" [...] John inquired, {{with a look}} of, great sympathy. But the lady, who now felt awkwardly, {{without knowing}} exactly why, <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> silence, and forced a faint laugh.|$|E
60|$|During this conversation, Mrs Nickleby had {{regarded}} {{the man with}} a severe and steadfast look. She now heaved a profound sigh, and pursing up her lips, <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> a slow and doubtful manner.|$|E
60|$|Miss Batchford obstinately <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> three times, <b>in</b> {{answer to}} those three questions.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{the thing}} became {{a dream to}} Genevieve. Maybe she had fainted, she did not know, but for what other reason should Silverstein have {{his arm around her}} {{supporting}} her?

[...] "You vill get your name in der papers," [...] she could hear Silverstein saying to her, as from a great distance; and she knew she was <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> refusal.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Philip," [...] said Maggie, <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> old childish way; [...] "I'm {{telling you}} the truth. It is all new and strange to me; but I don't think I could love any one better than I love you. I should like always to live with you--to make you happy. I have always been happy when I have been with you. There is only one thing I will not do for your sake; I will never do {{anything}} to wound my father. You must never ask that from me." ...|$|R
