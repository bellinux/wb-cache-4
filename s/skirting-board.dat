60|$|Anna Maria {{went down}} {{by way of}} the <b>skirting-board</b> and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough.|$|E
60|$|He groped his way {{carefully}} for several yards; {{he was at}} the back of the <b>skirting-board</b> in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture.|$|E
6000|$|... ''Tisn't the water, it's the mud on the <b>skirting-board</b> {{after it}} goes down that I mind,' Rhoda whispered. 'The last time Coxen's mill broke, I {{remember}} it {{came up to the}} second--no, third--step o' Mr. Sidney's stairs.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{means the}} {{loosening}} all the doors," [...] The Ghost replied, and laughed: [...] "It means the drilling holes by scores In all the <b>skirting-boards</b> and floors, To make a thorough draught.|$|R
5000|$|The Simple Villa, a {{style of}} home built from around 1895, often appears {{in the form of}} {{structures}} larger than the cottages and Victorian style properties built prior to this time. They generally consisted of a hallway with two rooms off each side and an indoor bathroom at the end. Often a [...] "lean-to" [...] attached {{to the back of the}} house would allow for a storage area that might include a wash-house. With the design of the property having the chimney within the house (as opposed to attached to an exterior side wall) fireplaces in the sitting room and kitchen could both use the same chimney — a configuration known as [...] "back-to-back". Brooklynites built these homes from timber — with most of the period features (including architraves, <b>skirting-boards,</b> doors and windows) purchasable as standard items from timber merchants.|$|R
60|$|ONE morning Lucinda and Jane {{had gone}} out for a drive in the doll's perambulator. There {{was no one in}} the nursery, and it was very quiet. Presently there was a little scuffling, {{scratching}} noise in a corner near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the <b>skirting-board.</b>|$|E
60|$|The furniture, {{excepting}} the piano, had a transitory look; two light wicker arm-chairs by the fire, the two frail {{stands of}} dark, polished wood, {{the couple of}} flimsy chairs, and the case of books in the recess--all seemed uneasy, {{as if they might}} be tossed out to leave the room clear, with its green floor and walls, and its white rim of <b>skirting-board,</b> serene.|$|E
60|$|Geoffrey took a match {{from the}} box. The same strange {{uncertainty}} {{which had already}} possessed his feet, appeared now to possess his hands. He struck the match too heavily against the sandpaper, and broke it. He tried another, and struck it too lightly to kindle the flame. Hester took the box out of his hands. Having lit the candle, she hel d it low, {{and pointed to the}} <b>skirting-board.</b>|$|E
60|$|Two little hooks {{were fixed}} into the floor, near {{the part of}} the wall from which the paper had been removed. Two lengths of fine and strong string were twisted once or twice round the hooks. The loose ends of the string {{extending}} to some length beyond the twisted parts, were neatly coiled away against the <b>skirting-board.</b> The other ends, drawn tight, disappeared in two small holes drilled through the wall, at a height of a foot from the floor.|$|E
40|$|Three way-finding {{systems were}} tested with {{large number of}} human voluteers: an {{existing}} system (IMO-compliant) and two new systems: one offering directional information along the skirting board; the other an electrical system, programmable in direction. The tests used almost 300 volunteers who evacuated from an imitated ship's interior. Most volunteens were asked {{to find their own}} way to the assembly stations; the others were allowed to work in groups of fou¡. Way-finding behaviour was recorded with cameras. The proportion of way-frnding errors was 24 % for the existing system, showing ample roorn for improvements. Way-finding eror:s were reduced for the new <b>skirting-board</b> system. This system is recommended because it can þe implemented easily. The programmable system was a failure: It was invisible in the light, and confusing in the dark Irrespective of the particular system, the tests revealed doors as the main source of way-finding errors. Measues to reduce their"diffic¡lty" were designed and tested For passage doors, one mea¡¡ure reduced the errors by 2 / 3. For cabin doors, an assembly-route sign at the door's inside was a similar success' The discussion of ggidance systems includes (a) clarity including line. of-sigbt consideration, adequate luminance, and a good ratio of 'simals' (evacuation signs) to 'noise' (advertisements); (b) technical robustness; and (c) programmable direction including situation awareness at the ship's bridge...|$|E
