60|$|They {{had been}} {{standing}} just within the folding doors upon a huge mat of bison skins. In front of them lay a great square court, paved with many-coloured marbles {{laid out in a}} labyrinth of arabesque design. In the centre a high fountain of carved jade shot five thin feathers of spray into the air, four of which curved towards each corner of the court to descend into broad marble basins, while the fifth mounted straight up to an immense height, and then tinkled back into the central reservoir. On either side of the court a tall, graceful palm-tree shot up its slender stem to break into a crown of drooping green leaves some fifty feet above their heads. All round were a series of Moorish arches, in jade and <b>serpentine</b> <b>marble,</b> with heavy curtains of the deepest purple to cover the doors which lay between them. In front, to right and to left, a broad staircase of marble, carpeted with rich thick Smyrna rug work, led upwards to the upper storeys, which were arranged around the central court. The temperature within was warm and yet fresh, like the air of an English May.|$|E

50|$|Buildings at 10, 12, 14, and 16 East Chase Street is a {{historic}} set of rowhouses located at Baltimore, Maryland, United States. Number 10 is a -story brick townhouse with a 3-bay front façade, fitted with marble facing from ground to first floor level. It {{is believed to have}} been designed by Bruce Price and / or E. Francis Baldwin, architects of neighboring Christ Church. Numbers 12, 14, and 16, by contrast, are identical -story, two-bay houses constructed of green <b>serpentine</b> <b>marble</b> with contrasting stone detail. The group dates from between 1870 and 1875. They represent a fine example of the Gothic Revival style as interpreted for domestic architecture.|$|E

The Stamford Mercury anticipated the church would be [...] "the prettiest modern Gothic erection in the town" [...] and, subsequently, [...] "…taking the size of the town into consideration, probably equal to any erected in England in modern times". It enthused that [...] "the altar and reredos…are beautiful specimens of art-work…of Caen stone. The former is enriched with gold monograms of Our Lady & St Austin to whom the church is dedicated, encircled by the pretty ball-flower ornament, the panels being divided by shafts of <b>serpentine</b> <b>marble</b> supporting exquisitely wrought foliated capitals… The reredos terminates in a symbolically foliated finial extending to the lofty open roof. The panels, which are as rich as the finest sculpture of angels (in bas relief) can render them, are also divided by black marble shafts, the rich tabernacle, for the reception of the shrine projecting from the centre. The church is lighted with four corona or stars of 15 gas jets each, the effect of which upon the altar and reredos and the numerous accessories they contain is gorgeous and is consequently very imposing…" [...] Pevsner reviewed the building without much enthusiasm however - albeit at a time when Victoriana was not highly thought of. He described the church's little campanile as [...] "an unbelievable bell-turret, asymmetically placed and most crudely detailed" [...] although it does provides a focus to the vista facing east from the middle of Broad Street and [...] "is the external focus of the building".|$|E

Very careful work of the Pisano-Venetian school of 1313, commissioned by the Abbot Gualpertino Mussato and originally erected in the old Gothic chapel in 1562. The monument is made of <b>serpentine</b> and <b>marble</b> of Verona. It is enriched with eight alabaster panels carved in bas-relief depicting angels and symbols related to the saint. The whole rests on two granite columns, two alabaster spiral columns and the center is placed on a support in Greek marble, representing caryatid angels, supporting the whole. The altar of the sixteenth century, today displaced, served as a base time for the monument. All around a modern and controversial wooden choir. At the top is placed the sixteenth-century version - attributed to Alessandro Bonvicino - of the Virgin Salus Populi Patavini Constantinople. It is framed and supported by the bronze angels of Hamlet Sartori (1960-1961).

50|$|Marble is a metamorphosed {{limestone}} {{formed by}} re-crystallization. It {{is available in}} different colours and textures. Marble deposits are available in many states of India. It {{has been used in}} India for a long time. It was used in construction of Temples, Tombs and Palaces. Now it is also used for flooring in homes and offices. It is preferred for flooring because of its durability and water resistance. Marbles which are economically important are available in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. As on 2010, there was 1931 million tonnes of resource, including all grades of marble.

500|$|The {{lands that}} make up the Trinity River basin today began to take shape over 200 million years ago by the {{collision}} of several exotic terranes – or crustal fragments of the Pacific Plate – with the North American Plate, causing uplift of the sea floor under what is now northwestern California. During the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, tectonic movement along the plate boundary produced a range of mountains much higher than those found in the area today. Over millions of years these mountains were eroded, then reformed again as the next oceanic terrane collided with the continental crust. This repeating cycle of erosion and orogeny created the complex [...] "jumble of different rock types" [...] that characterizes the region today. Rocks commonly found in the Trinity River area include gabbro, chert, granite, diorite, limestone, sandstone, <b>serpentine,</b> schist and <b>marble.</b> Gold-bearing quartz veins are widespread in local metamorphic rock formations; the richness of the area made it among the focal points of the California Gold Rush.|$|R
25|$|These Precambrian {{rocks are}} schists and phyllites, often much contorted and disturbed. The general line of strike of the {{formations}} {{in the island}} is from north-east to south-west.} A belt of granitic rocks lies immediately north-west of the central Precambrian mass, reaching from Llanfaelog near the coast to the vicinity of Llanerchymedd. Between this granite and the Precambrian of Holyhead is a narrow tract of Ordovician slates and grits with Llandovery beds in places; this tract spreads out {{in the north of}} the island between Dulas Bay and Carmel Point. A small patch of Ordovician strata lies on the northern side of Beaumaris. In parts, these Ordovician rocks are much folded, crushed and metamorphosed, and they are associated with schists and altered volcanic rocks which are probably Precambrian. Between the eastern and central Precambrian masses Carboniferous rocks are found. The Carboniferous Limestone occupies a broad area south of Lligwy Bay and Pentraeth, and sends a narrow spur in a south-westerly direction by Llangefni to Malltraeth Sands. The limestone is underlain on the north-west by a red basement conglomerate and yellow sandstone (sometimes considered to be of Old Red Sandstone age). Limestone occurs again on the north coast around Llanfihangel and Llangoed; and in the south-west round Llanidan near the Menai Strait. Puffin Island is made of carboniferous limestone. Malltraeth marsh is occupied by Coal Measures, and a small patch of the same formation appears near Tal-y-foel Ferry on the Menai Strait. A patch of rhyolitic/felsitic rocks form Parys Mountain, where copper and iron ochre have been worked. <b>Serpentine</b> (Mona <b>Marble)</b> is found near Llanfair-yn-Neubwll and upon the opposite shore in Holyhead.|$|R

60|$|XVII. It is not {{my purpose}} to enter {{into any of the}} {{questions}} which the application of this principle involves. They are of too great interest and complexity to be even touched upon within my present limits, but this is broadly to be noticed, that those styles of architecture which are picturesque in the sense above explained with respect to sculpture, that is to say, whose decoration depends on the arrangement of points of shade rather than on purity of outline, do not suffer, but commonly gain in richness of effect when their details are partly worn away; hence such styles, pre-eminently that of French Gothic, should always be adopted when the materials to be employed are liable to degradation, as brick, sandstone, or soft limestone; and styles in any degree dependent on purity of line, as the Italian Gothic, must be practised altogether in hard and undecomposing materials, granite <b>serpentine,</b> or crystalline <b>marbles.</b> There {{can be no doubt that}} the nature of the accessible materials influenced the formation of both styles; and it should still more authoritatively determine our choice of either.|$|R

For this purpose five different types of stones (granite, basalt, <b>serpentine,</b> limestone and <b>marble)</b> were treated with water jet and the results were compared with the results obtained from traditional methods. The results of the color, gloss, luminance and roughness analysis were used as the comparison parameters. Results so far achieved indicate that the application of water jets in surface treatment can reduce (or even eliminate) some disadvantages of traditional methods because it enables to obtain a surface with required roughness while preserving aesthetic appearance of the stone...|$|R

40|$|Dimension {{stone in}} the UAE This map shows the rock units of the {{northern}} United Arab Emirates (UAE) that potentially {{are a source of}} dimension stone. The distribution of the rock units is from the 1 : 50 000 scale geological maps produced by the UAE Ministry of Energy (Styles et al, 2008) Their potential as dimension stone is based on assessment of outcrops and samples, the location of which are shown on the map (triangle symbol). This assessment should not be used to assume that all rock in each geological unit is of suitable quality for dimension stone. Dimension stone covers a wide variety of highly polished, naturally occurring stones used for the external cladding, structural components and internal decoration of buildings. Rock types used include igneous (granite, gabbro, porphyry, basalt and <b>serpentine),</b> metamorphic (<b>marble,</b> gneiss and slate) and sedimentary (sandstone, limestone and travertine). The UAE has a thriving dimension stone industry that relies on stone mainly imported from India, Saudi Arabia, Spain, China, Oman, Italy, Iran, Turkey, Greece and Pakistan. In 2008, the UAE imported over 200, 000 tonnes of dimension stone valued at over US 42 million. There is currently no significant production of dimension stone from quarries in the UAE. Historically, the architecture of the UAE has many different influences including Greek, Persian, Portuguese, Indian and British. Traditionally, local construction materials used in buildings include coral, gypsum, mud bricks, stone, wood and thatch. Modern day architecture in the UAE is dominated by prestige building projects which make use of dimension stone from across the world including Crema Marfil (beige-coloured limestone from Spain), Carrara Bianco (white marble from Italy), Rosso Levanto (red serpentinite from Italy), Galaxy Black (black gabbro anorthosite from India) and Emperadore Dark (brecciated dolomite from Spain). How this map was created This map {{is the result of a}} study carried out by the British Geological Survey (BGS) to identify rocks that might be used for the production of dimension stone based on knowledge of the geology of the northern Emirates of the UAE (Styles et al, 2008). The study area includes the carbonate rocks mainly to east of Ras Al Khaimah and the igneous rocks of the Oman-UAE ophiolite mainly to the west of Fujairah. In total, the suitability of rocks at 31 sites (triangle symbol on map) was assessed. This assessment was based on the following criteria: •	the likelihood of extracting blocks larger than 1 metre square. This was determined from the density of discontinuities such as bedding planes, joints, fractures, faults and any other planes of weakness that may lead to the breakup of the stone when extracted; •	the technical properties of the stone which indicate if it can be used without breaking up during extraction, transport, processing and use. These include compressive strength, density, water absorption and porosity (as shown for each rock unit in Table 1); •	the appearance of the stone when cut and polished. A representative image of each sample from the sites with high potential for the production of dimension stones is shown in photographs 1 to 12; •	the accessibility of the site, the likelihood of quarrying and the potential for the production of industrial by-products from the production waste Each site was classified as having high, medium or low potential for the production of dimension stone (Table 1). Of the sites assessed, 12 were classified as having high potential for producing dimension stone and these are indicated on the map with a red triangle. The sites with moderate or low potential for production of dimension stone are indicated on the map with a black triangle. This map was produced as part of the study of the ‘Dimension stone resources of the UAE’ which was carried out in 2010 to 2011 and was funded by the UAE Ministry of Energy. Full details of the dimension stone study are available from the Ministry of Energy (Mitchell et al, 2012) ...|$|R
6000|$|... § XXIII. This is {{especially}} {{the case with}} that second branch of the Renaissance which, as above noticed, was engrafted at Venice on the Byzantine types. So soon as the classical enthusiasm required the banishment of Gothic forms, it was natural that the Venetian mind should turn back with affection to the Byzantine models in which the round arches and simple shafts, necessitated by recent law, were presented under a form consecrated by the usage of their ancestors. And, accordingly, the first distinct school of architecture[3] which arose under the new dynasty, was {{one in which the}} method of inlaying marble, and the general forms of shaft and arch, were adopted from the buildings of the twelfth century, and applied with the utmost possible refinements of modern skill. Both at Verona and Venice the resulting architecture is exceedingly beautiful. At Verona it is, indeed, less Byzantine, but possesses a character of richness and tenderness almost peculiar to that city. At Venice it is more severe, but yet adorned with sculpture which, for sharpness of touch and delicacy of minute form, cannot be rivalled, and rendered especially brilliant and beautiful by the introduction of those inlaid circles of colored <b>marble,</b> <b>serpentine,</b> and porphyry, by which Phillippe de Commynes was so much struck on his first entrance into the city. The two most refined buildings in this style in Venice are, the small Church of the Miracoli, and the Scuola di San Marco beside the Church of St. John and St. Paul. The noblest is the Rio Façade of the Ducal Palace. The Casa Dario, and Casa Manzoni, on the Grand Canal, are exquisite examples of the school, as applied to domestic architecture; and, in the reach of the canal between the Casa Foscari and the Rialto, there are several palaces, of which the Casa Contarini (called [...] "delle Figure") is the principal, belonging to the same group, though somewhat later, and remarkable for the association of the Byzantine principles of color with the severest lines of the Roman pediment, gradually superseding the round arch. The precision of chiselling and delicacy of proportion in the ornament and general lines of these palaces cannot be too highly praised; and I believe that the traveller in Venice, in general, gives them rather too little attention than too much. But while I would ask him to stay his gondola beside each of them long enough to examine their every line, I must also warn him to observe, most carefully, the peculiar feebleness and want of soul in the conception of their ornament, which mark them as belonging to a period of decline; as well as the absurd mode of introduction of their pieces of colored marble: these, instead of being simply and naturally inserted in the masonry, are placed in small circular or oblong frames of sculpture, like mirrors or pictures, and are represented as suspended by ribands against the wall; a pair of wings being generally fastened on to the circular tablets, as if to relieve the ribands and knots from their weight, and the whole series tied under the chin of a little cherub at the top, who is nailed against the façade like a hawk on a barn door.|$|R
40|$|The Rock Resources of the Northern Emirates The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has vast {{resources}} of limestone and hard {{rock in the}} northern Emirates. These are currently exploited by quarrying companies to produce construction aggregate and raw material for the manufacture of cement, {{with a small amount}} being used to produce rock wool, dimension stone and mineral filler. The demand by industry for higher value mineral products that could be produced from these resources is mostly met by imports. As part of the work funded by the UAE Ministry of Energy, the British Geological Survey (BGS) carried out studies (during 2008 to 2011) of the hard rock, dimension stone, and limestone and dolomite {{resources of}} the UAE. Hard rock resources There is a well established quarrying industry in the Hajar Mountains of the northern and eastern UAE that produces a range of rock products (mostly construction aggregate) from the UAE-Oman ophiolite rocks (mainly gabbro with ultramafic rocks including harzburgite and dunite). Many quarries are located in areas where the rock resources are of poor quality and/ or the reserves are limited. A study was carried out by the BGS to make the geological information, available in the maps and reports published by the BGS in 2006, more accessible to the quarrying industry. Over 100 quarries were surveyed in the Fujairah, Ras al Khaimah, Ajman, Dubai and Sharjah emirates and rocks samples were collected and tested. A new map was produced that classifies the hard rock resources of the ophiolite according to their suitability for use as construction aggregate. Five categories were used in the classification scheme including: Highest grade gabbro aggregate; Good gabbro aggregate; Good gabbro aggregate mixed with unsuitable rocks; Unsuitable rocks; and Peridotite serpentinite good aggregate. Unsuitable rocks include basalt, wehrlite and rocks generally near the major fault zones that are intensely altered. The map also includes buffer zones to indicate areas where quarrying may have a detrimental impact on local communities or the road network. The aggregate suitability map could be used for planning purposes such as the expansion of existing quarries and the location of new quarries. It will greatly reduce the quarrying of poor quality rock and improve the standard of construction material produced in the future. Dimension stone resources Dimension stone is natural stone that has been extracted and cut for use in wall cladding, floor tiles and structural components in modern tower blocks, hotels, offices, airports, shopping malls and private homes. A wide variety of rock types are used including igneous (granite, gabbro, porphyry, basalt and <b>serpentine),</b> metamorphic (<b>marble,</b> gneiss and slate) and sedimentary (sandstone, limestone and travertine). The UAE has a thriving dimension stone industry that uses stone imported from India, Saudi Arabia, Spain, China, Oman, Italy, Iran, Turkey, Greece and Pakistan. In 2008, the UAE imported over 200, 000 tonnes of dimension stone valued at over US 42 million. There is currently no significant production of dimension stone from quarries in the UAE. A study was carried out by the BGS to identify limestone and hard rock resources in the UAE {{that could be used for}} the production of dimension stone. In total 31 sites were assessed and samples collected for test work to assess their suitability. Each site was assessed to determine the presence of planes of weakness (bedding, faults, fractures and joints) that could affect the production of large blocks, as well as the accessibility and likelihood of quarrying being permitted. The samples were tested to determine their strength, water absorption, porosity and density, as well as their appearance when cut and polished. The twelve sites identified that met the assessment criteria occur in the Musandam 2 Formation, Dhera Limestone Formation, Jebel Qamar South Limestone Formation, Jebel Qamar North Limestone Formation, Fujairah Gabbro, Kalba Gabbro, Layered Gabbro and Harzburgite. High purity limestone and dolomite resources Limestone and dolomite have many high value industrial applications including the manufacture of paint, paper, plastic, pharmaceuticals, glass, ceramics, food supplements, and chemicals. Currently, the limestone and dolomite resources of the UAE are mainly worked to produce low value construction aggregate, with little production of high-purity products. In 2008 the UAE imported over 200, 000 tonnes of high purity limestone and dolomite valued at over US 20 million to meet industrial demand. A study was carried out by the BGS to assess the potential of the resources in the UAE to produce high-purity limestone and dolomite. Nearly 250 samples of limestone and dolomite were collected from the northern emirates and tested to determine their chemical composition. A new map was produced that classifies the limestone resources of the UAE according to their purity as industrial-grade limestone (calcium carbonate). Five categories were used in the classification scheme including Very high purity; High purity; Medium purity; Low purity; and Impure. The purity is based on the calcium oxide (CaO), magnesium oxide (MgO), silica (SiO 2) and iron (Fe 2 O 3) content of the limestone. Localities of high purity dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate) are also shown on the resource map. Sixty five localities of high purity limestone and 6 localities of high purity dolomite were identified. This study has shown that the UAE has resources of high purity limestone and dolomite that could be used to produce valuable industrial products. The development of these resources has the potential to make a substantial contribution to the economic diversification of the UAE economy...|$|R
