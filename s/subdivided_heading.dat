5000|$|The polity of the Anglican Church of Kenya is Episcopal church governance, {{which is}} the same as other Anglican churches. That is, headed by bishops from the Greek word, [...] "episcopos," [...] which means {{overseer}} or superindendant. The church maintains a system of geographical parishes organized into dioceses. There are 33 of these, each headed by a bishop:Each diocese is divided into archdeaconries, each headed by an archdeacon, who is a priest. The archdeaconries are further <b>subdivided</b> into parishes, <b>headed</b> by a rector. Parishes are <b>subdivided</b> into sub-parishes, <b>headed</b> by lay readers.|$|R

60|$|With {{the view}} of obtaining a more {{satisfactory}} result the patterns were <b>subdivided</b> under fifty-three <b>heads,</b> and an experiment was made with the fore, middle, and ring-fingers of 150 fraternal couplets (300 individuals and 900 digits) by Mr. F. Howard Collins, who kindly undertook the considerable labour of indexing and tabulating them.|$|R
50|$|Most {{universities}} and colleges are <b>subdivided</b> into departments, <b>headed</b> by the prefekt and the department board or, sometimes, by the prefekt alone. Prefekts may be appointed by and report directly to the department board, the faculty board or the rector. There are no formal requirements for a prefekt, but adjunkts who have been a prefekt usually hold a position as lektor or higher.|$|R
50|$|Each diocese {{except for}} Central Melanesia (the Honiara area) {{is divided into}} regions, each headed by a senior priest. The regions are further {{subdivided}} into parishes or districts (the two words being interchangeable), headed by a parish priest, usually called a rector. Parishes may be <b>subdivided</b> into subparishes, <b>headed</b> by assistant priests. Catechists are lay people appointed by a local community and authorised by the bishop to take services and look after the spiritual life of a village.|$|R

Other categories of breeders that perhaps can be <b>subdivided</b> under the <b>heading</b> [...] "opportunistic" [...] {{have been used to}} describe many species, such as many that are anurans like frogs. These include sporadic wet and sporadic dry, describing animals that breed sporadically not always under favorable conditions of rain or lack thereof.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} {{and some of}} the first floor have {{recently}} undergone an aggressive refurbishment but the logic of the circulation and the internal spaces remains though fabric has been lost. The former ground floor waiting room, now the reception and administration area, is lit from the courtyard by a bank of full height plain leadlight awning and fixed glass windows which are operated by a manual turning device. The mezzanine between the ground and first floor does not continue over this reception area where the ceiling height is {{to the level of the}} mezzanine storey ceiling. The present waiting room occupies the former office suite adjacent to the vestibule. Both the Hospital and College levels have surgeries in the northeast and southwest wings. These are long open rooms <b>subdivided</b> by <b>head</b> height partitioning. The recent refurbishment has removed earlier partitions, equipment, finishes, floor coverings and joinery but the integrity of the spaces has survived. The large timber casement windows with semi-circular fanlights and terrazzo sills remain in the surgeries at the Hospital level and the rectangular timber casement windows survive on the College level. The decorative timber and metal flat arch to the former waiting room and some timber doors remain to the ground floor.|$|R
40|$|Any {{strategy}} {{which aims}} {{to deal with the}} empowerment of the poor, that of women in particular, must be based on an understanding of and the ability to overcome the causes of the lack of power which lies behind it. A review of the literature suggests that there is much debate at the theoretical level as to what constitutes empowerment and how best it can be achieved. A large number of micro level studies have been undertaken so far by various scholars, institutions, NGOs, and sponsors of micro finance programmes highlighting {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the programmes at international, national, and regional levels. The major themes of certain selected studies are reviewed in this paper. They are <b>subdivided</b> into four <b>heads,</b> viz. empowerment: conceptual analysis, micro finance at a glance, and impact of microfinance on women empowerment...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The rapid {{decline in}} use of {{conventional}} total hip replacement {{with a large}} femoral head size and a metal-on-metal bearing surface might lead to increased popularity of ceramic-on-ceramic bearings as another hard-on-hard alternative that allows implantation of a larger head. We sought to address comparative effectiveness of ceramic-on-ceramic and metal-on-HXLPE (highly cross-linked polyethylene) implants by utilizing the distributed health data network of the ICOR (International Consortium of Orthopaedic Registries), an unprecedented collaboration of national and regional registries and the U. S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration). METHODS: A distributed health data network {{was developed by the}} ICOR and used in this study. The data from each registry are standardized and provided at a level of aggregation most suitable for the detailed analysis of interest. The data are combined across registries for comprehensive assessments. The ICOR coordinating center and study steering committee defined the inclusion criteria for this study as total hip arthroplasty performed without cement from 2001 to 2010 in patients forty-five to sixty-four years of age with osteoarthritis. Six national and regional registries (Kaiser Permanente and HealthEast in the U. S., Emilia-Romagna region in Italy, Catalan region in Spain, Norway, and Australia) participated in this study. Multivariate meta-analysis was performed with use of linear mixed models, with survival probability as the unit of analysis. We present the results of the fixed-effects model and include the results of the random-effects model in an appendix. SAS version 9. 2 was used for all analyses. We first compared femoral head sizes of > 28 mm and â‰¤ 28 mm within ceramic-on-ceramic implants and then compared ceramic-on-ceramic with metal-on-HXLPE. RESULTS: A total of 34, 985 patients were included; 52 % were female. We found a lower risk of revision associated with use of ceramic-on-ceramic implants when a larger head size was used (HR [hazard ratio] = 0. 73, 95 % CI [confidence interval] = 0. 60 to 0. 88, p = 0. 001). Use of smaller-head-size ceramic-on-ceramic bearings was associated with a higher risk of failure compared with metal-on-HXLPE bearings (HR = 1. 36, 95 % CI = 1. 09 to 1. 68, p = 0. 006). Use of large-head-size ceramic-on-ceramic bearings was associated with a small protective effect relative to metal-on-HXLPE bearings (not <b>subdivided</b> by <b>head</b> size) in years zero to two, but this difference dissipated over the longer term. CONCLUSIONS: Our multinational study based on a harmonized, distributed network showed that use of ceramic-on-ceramic implants with a smaller head size in total hip arthroplasty without cement was associated with a higher risk of revision compared with metal-on-HXLPE and > 28 -mm ceramic-on-ceramic implants. These findings warrant careful reflection by regulatory and clinical communities and wide dissemination to patients for informed decision-making regarding such surgery.
