5|$|Before {{the subway}} was built, the Bloor <b>streetcar</b> line {{operated}} {{along the route}} between Jane Street and Luttrell Avenue. Paired PCC streetcars or multiple units (MUs) operated from 1950 {{to the opening of}} the subway line in 1966. The TTC favoured this route because the Prince Edward Viaduct made it easier to build a subway across the Don Valley, and the <b>streetcar</b> that ran along the route was filled with passengers travelling from East York and Scarborough. To provide relief to this <b>streetcar</b> line and {{to make it easier to}} expand into the suburbs, the line was built under Bloor street and Danforth Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The <b>streetcar</b> {{system was}} built by Twin City Rapid Transit and {{operated}} efficiently through 1949, with a program of reinvesting their profits into system improvements. However, in 1949, New York investor Charles Green gained control of the system, halted the rebuilding program, and announced a goal of completely converting the system to buses by 1958. These policies alienated the public and he was ousted in 1951, but his successor, Fred Ossanna, continued to cut service and replace the system with buses. On June 19, 1954, the last <b>streetcar</b> took its run. A photo taken in 1954 shows James Towley handing Fred Ossanna a check while one of the streetcars burned in the background. Later on, {{it was discovered that}} Ossanna and associates had plundered the <b>streetcar</b> system for personal gain. A small section of the line between Lake Calhoun and Lake Harriet is now operated by the Minnesota <b>Streetcar</b> Museum.|$|E
5|$|Capitol Hill {{station is}} also served by bus and <b>streetcar</b> stops located near its entrances. The First Hill <b>Streetcar</b> line terminates at Broadway and Denny Way, {{adjacent}} to the west entrance, and connects the neighborhood to First Hill, Little Saigon, Chinatown-International District, and Pioneer Square. King County Metro operates several bus routes that converge at Broadway and E John Street, traveling west towards Downtown Seattle and South Lake Union; east towards Volunteer Park and the Central District; south towards First Hill, Beacon Hill, and the Rainier Valley; and north towards the University District.|$|E
5000|$|Due to a {{shortage}} of <b>streetcars</b> caused by late delivery of the new Bombardier Flexity Outlook <b>streetcars,</b> as of October 2016, the route has been operated using buses rather than <b>streetcars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|These <b>streetcars</b> were [...] "retired" [...] in 1939 to {{give way}} to the cheaper, Depression-era Presidents’ Conference Committee (PCC) <b>streetcars.</b> Today, only three of the {{original}} twenty-four Class 1 <b>streetcars</b> remain in existence.|$|R
25|$|Muni owns a large {{selection}} of equipment {{for use on}} the F line, although {{not all of them}} are in service at the same time. The car fleet includes four sub-fleets of PCC <b>streetcars.</b> These are Peter Witt <b>streetcars,</b> pre-PCC veteran <b>streetcars</b> from San Francisco, and a diverse collection of 10 <b>streetcars</b> and trams from various overseas operators.|$|R

5|$|The District of Columbia Department of Transportation is {{building}} the new D.C. <b>Streetcar</b> system to improve transit connectivity within the District. A tram line to connect Bolling Air Force Base to the Anacostia station and was originally expected {{to open in}} 2010. <b>Streetcar</b> routes have been proposed in the Atlas District, Capitol Hill, and the K Street corridor. After seven years of construction, the Atlas District route, known as the H/Benning Street route, opened on February 27, 2016.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the {{suburban}} lines tempted KES to extend their <b>streetcar</b> service west from Skøyen as a suburban line; the Lilleaker Line opened to Lilleaker in 1919, to Avløs in 1924 and to Kolsås in 1930. A new section from Jar to Sørbyhaugen opened in 1942, connecting the line from Jar to Kolsås to Nationaltheatret, and making it a rapid transit and the replacement of stock with wide suburban standard. This service remained part of the municipal Oslo Sporveier, that had bought all the <b>streetcar</b> companies in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Upon opening, the Bloor–Danforth {{line was}} well received: a survey taken {{four months later}} showed that the subway was used by 10,000 riders per hour. As a result, many bus and <b>streetcar</b> routes were either {{discontinued}} or shortened. Various bus and <b>streetcar</b> routes, which connected to the subway stations allowed the line {{to continue to grow}} and become more sustainable. The line carries an average of 519,180 passengers on weekdays during the 2011–2012 operating year.|$|E
5000|$|The new station {{will have}} two side platforms, with a {{narrower}} platform between the tracks for passengers offloading from outbound trains and a wider platform with canopies for those waiting to board inbound trains. The new station would eliminate <b>streetcars</b> having to cross Commonwealth Avenue traffic to access the platforms, which will reduce moves across Commonwealth by 89%, though <b>streetcars</b> will still need to cross to access the yard. [...] It will have raised platforms for level, handicapped-accessible boarding on newer low-floor <b>streetcars</b> and a ramp for accessible boarding on older high-floor <b>streetcars.</b> (The current station is only accessible for low-floor <b>streetcars.)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|In 1888, Frank Sprague {{installed}} a complete system of electric <b>streetcars</b> in Richmond, Virginia. This {{was the first}} large scale and successful use of electricity to run a city's entire system of <b>streetcars.</b> Operation of <b>streetcars</b> continued until they were totally replaced by buses in 1949.|$|R

5|$|In 1983, {{there was}} {{discussion}} of a rapid transit extension from Kennedy to Scarborough City Centre. As multiple types of technologies were examined many politicians requested a subway extension instead of the then proposed <b>streetcar</b> line. Instead, a medium-capacity rail transport system, known as the Scarborough RT was built.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{service in the}} tunnel, International District/Chinatown station is within close proximity to several other regional and local transit services. King Street Station is located one block west of the station and is served by inter-city Amtrak trains on the Cascades, Coast Starlight, and Empire Builder, as well as Sounder commuter trains to Everett, Tacoma, and Lakewood. BoltBus, a private bus operator, uses a curbside stop near the station for its intercity routes serving Vancouver and Portland, Oregon. The First Hill <b>Streetcar</b> stops one block east of the station on South Jackson Street, connecting the area to Little Saigon, Yesler Terrace, First Hill, and Capitol Hill. The Waterfront <b>Streetcar</b> also served the station, using a separate platform on 5th Avenue South, until service was suspended in 2005.|$|E
50|$|The city once {{provided}} trolley service {{during the}} late 19th and early 20th century. Known as the Fresno City Railway Company and later the Fresno Traction Company, the service operated horse-drawn <b>streetcars</b> from 1887 to 1901. Electric <b>streetcars</b> were introduced in 1903. The electric <b>streetcars</b> were used until 1939.|$|R

5|$|In view {{of growing}} labor shortages, on July 1, 1944 the War Manpower Commission made an {{important}} decision, ruling that {{from then on}} all hiring of male employees in the country was to be done through the United States Employment Service (USES). By that time the USES followed strict anti-discrimination employment practices. The PTC management finally gave in and within a week posted notices about available skilled positions that {{would be open to}} all applicants, regardless of race. The company accepted eight black applicants (three from the USES and five from its own ranks) to train as <b>streetcar</b> coachmen. Their training was to take place in late July, and they were to start taking an empty <b>streetcar</b> on the lines from August 1. It was that impending trial run of the streetcars by the eight black trainees that finally triggered the strike.|$|E
5|$|King County Metro {{provides}} frequent stop {{bus service}} {{within the city}} and surrounding county, {{as well as the}} South Lake Union <b>Streetcar</b> line and the First Hill <b>Streetcar</b> line. Seattle {{is one of the few}} cities in North America whose bus fleet includes electric trolleybuses. Sound Transit currently provides an express bus service within the metropolitan area, two Sounder commuter rail lines between the suburbs and downtown, and its Central Link light rail line between the University of Washington and Angle Lake. Washington State Ferries, which manages the largest network of ferries in the United States and third largest in the world, connects Seattle to Bainbridge and Vashon Islands in Puget Sound and to Bremerton and Southworth on the Kitsap Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), {{a public}} {{authority}} presided by New York City, {{was created in}} 1953 to take over subway, bus, and <b>streetcar</b> operations from the city, and placed under control of the state-level Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1968.|$|E

5|$|Two subway stations, West Portal Station and Forest Hill Station, {{and five}} of the six light-rail lines, J Church, K Ingleside, L Taraval, M Ocean View, and N Judah, are {{remnants}} of an extensive <b>streetcar</b> system that survived the mass conversion to buses in the 1950s. In 1980, seven subway stations, from Embarcadero Station to Castro Street Station, were opened with the inauguration of the Market Street Subway underneath Market Street, marking the conversion of San Francisco's <b>streetcar</b> system into the Muni Metro. In 1998, four surface stations on The Embarcadero opened, connecting the newly constructed AT Park (then called Pacific Bell Park) and Caltrain to Muni Metro. In 2007, the T Third Street line was started along 18 new surface stations built along new track laid from Caltrain down {{the eastern side of the}} city to the city line.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} about 1,500 men began marching towards the {{electric}} distribution center used to power the entire <b>streetcar</b> system, several blocks away from the terminal building. The police had maintained a heavy guard around the building during the ongoing strike and Sheriff Porttens had given orders to use firearms to disperse any attempt by the strikers to take the building. As the crowd neared the building, the police opened fire. Several were injured and the crowd was driven away.|$|E
5|$|All {{stations}} except Chester {{connect to}} surface TTC bus and/or <b>streetcar</b> routes during regular operating hours.
