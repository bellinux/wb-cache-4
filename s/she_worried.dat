Initially, <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> {{that she might}} be too shy to play before big crowds, but she eventually triumphed over her fear and realized her tremendous talent as a live performer when she played to rapt audiences at coffee houses and rallies around the sprawling Rutgers campus. She worked as a flight attendant before starting her music career.|$|E
25|$|In late 1898, {{physicians}} diagnosed the Empress Dowager with inoperable breast cancer, {{forcing her}} to stay in bed for long periods. The cancer spread to her spine by the autumn of 1900, and as <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> about her personal letters (in which she detailed her concern over Germany's future under her son) falling {{into the hands of}} the Emperor, she requested that the letters be brought back to Great Britain in a cloak-and-dagger operation by her godson Frederick Ponsonby, the private secretary of her brother King Edward VII, who was making his final visit to his terminally ill sister in Kronberg on 23 February 1901. These letters were later edited by Ponsonby and put into context by his background commentary to form the book that was published in 1928.|$|E
500|$|Berkman {{continued}} {{to suffer from}} depression and increasingly spoke about committing suicide. He began a new lecture tour, but when he failed to appear in Cleveland, concerned friends sent a telegram to Goldman in New York. <b>She</b> <b>worried</b> that he had killed himself. Anarchists across the country searched for Berkman in police stations, hospitals, and morgues. Even newspapers wondered where he was, speculating {{that he might have}} been kidnapped by Pittsburgh detectives, by Secret Service agents, or by [...] "agents of millionaires" [...] who opposed his message. Three days later, Berkman appeared in New York and contacted Goldman. He said the lecture tour had made him feel miserable. He had purchased a handgun in Cleveland with the intention of killing himself in a city where nobody knew him, but he was unable to complete the act.|$|E

500|$|Miss Rosa {{undertakes}} chemotherapy {{to treat}} her cancer which leaves her bald. Rosenblat did not shave her head for the role because <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> about other roles. She had to wear a silicone [...] "appliance" [...] {{on her head and}} neck. Each morning on set makeup artist Josh Turri made up the appliance onto her. The process would take approximately three hours and Turri added false beauty marks, eyebrows and small veins to complete Miss Rosa's look. Rosenblat described him as [...] "utterly brilliant and a perfectionist ... so you got this entirely organic sense that I was utterly bald and suffering [...] cancer." [...] While on set fellow actors and crew members incorrectly assumed she had shaved her head. The weather during filming also affected Miss Rosa's costumer. During warm weather crew shielded Rosenblat from the sun with umbrellas because the heat would cause the make up to crack. Other breaches were caused by perspiration and Turri would drain water from underneath the prosthetics prior to repairing it. At the end of each shoot it took Rosenblat 45 minutes to remove the appliance.|$|E
500|$|Ida Skelton, {{who held}} {{multiple}} jobs {{to support her}} family {{after the death of}} her husband, did not suggest that her youngest son had run away from home to become an entertainer, but [...] "his destiny had caught up with him at an early age". She let him go with her blessing. Times were tough during the Great Depression, and it may have meant one less child for her to feed. Around 1929, while Skelton was still a teen, he joined [...] "Doc" [...] R.E. Lewis's traveling medicine show as an errand boy who sold bottles of medicine to the audience. During one show, when Skelton accidentally fell from the stage, breaking several bottles of medicine as he fell, people laughed. Both Lewis and Skelton realized one could earn a living with this ability and the fall was worked into the show. He also told jokes and sang in the medicine show during his four years there. Skelton earned ten dollars a week, and sent all of it home to his mother. When <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> that he was keeping nothing for his own needs, Skelton reassured her: [...] "We get plenty to eat, and we sleep in the wagon." ...|$|E
500|$|Consistent with Bolkovac's account, The Whistleblower portrays DynCorp International {{employees}} {{as participants in}} the postwar Bosnian sex trade with the UN turning a blind eye. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted a screening of the film and promised action would be taken to prevent further instances of human trafficking. Bolkovac responded, [...] "Unfortunately, the widespread horror is already there. This {{is not going to}} be simple or a quick fix." [...] She said that in addition to Bosnia, peacekeepers had violated human rights in Nigeria, Kosovo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, the Congo, Liberia, Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Colombia, Guinea and Sudan. Kondracki added that while she wanted to be optimistic and hoped that the screening would [...] "lead to genuine discussion and thought about the UN's involvement in sex trafficking and other crimes", <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> that it might not have the desired lasting impact: [...] "I know we are going to hear a lot about what has been done since the time depicted in this film, but rhetoric only goes so far. The situation has escalated." [...] Following the theatrical release of The Whistleblower, The Guardian reported that other UN officials attempted to downplay the events depicted and that initiatives against trafficking in Bosnia were aborted.|$|E

500|$|There {{is rapidly}} growing {{interest}} in disorganized attachment from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers. However, the disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticized by some for being too encompassing, including Ainsworth herself. In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as [...] "open-ended, {{in the sense that}} subcategories may be distinguished", as <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> that too many different forms of behaviour might be treated {{as if they were the}} same thing. Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger). Moreover, Crittenden argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that [...] "even disorganized attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent". However, [...] "the presumption that many indices of 'disorganization' are aspects of organized patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganization, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response." [...] For example, [...] "Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions. In videos of the Strange Situation Procedure, they tend to occur when a rejected/neglected child approaches the stranger in an intrusion of desire for comfort, then loses muscular control and falls to the floor, overwhelmed by the intruding fear of the unknown, potentially dangerous, strange person." ...|$|E
2500|$|Underwood {{was given}} an {{increasing}} number of major stories to cover for the Record, and her reputation as a reporter grew. [...] She was offered a job at William Randolph Hearst's Herald-Express, but she turned it down. The Herald-Express expected her to provide her own automobile, but she did not own a car. In addition, she felt that she was gaining valuable experience in every aspect of the newspaper business at the perennially short-staffed Record, and <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> that she would be more constricted at the Herald-Express.|$|E

2500|$|A devout Catholic who did {{not want}} to have children, <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> about pregnancy. Some historians believe nothing further {{developed}} besides correspondence. Since Jefferson was very discreet, no one knows for certain the extent of their relationship. Jefferson eventually stopped writing her until some time later when she contacted him; their renewed correspondence continued until his death. Historians such as Andrew Burstein have suggested the relationship was romantic mostly on Jefferson's side, and that Cosway was his opposite, more artistic than rational. Their correspondence survives. Before Jefferson left Paris, he wrote her, [...] "I am going to America and you are going to Italy. One of us is going the wrong way, for the way will ever be wrong that leads us further apart." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, a quiet {{relationship}} between Hilton and the tabloids led entertainment writers {{to suggest that}} her popularity had waned. In a CNN story, [...] "Why has Paris Hilton disappeared?", editor Samantha Yanks of Gotham and Hamptons magazines said: [...] "Phase one was the ascension, seemingly out of nowhere. That came with a media frenzy, the antics, the partying, the music, the babe-like status and of course, the fashion label. Phase two, she disappears". Hilton's absence from the news was an apparent response {{to a new generation}} of tabloid consumers uninterested in her. This suspicion was reinforced in June 2011 when her reality show, The World According to Paris, had low ratings and Hilton walked out during an interview with Good Morning America when asked if <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> about her moment having passed.|$|E
2500|$|Hurston {{opposed the}} Supreme Court ruling in the Brown v. Board of Education case of 1954. She {{felt that if}} {{separate}} schools were truly equal (and she {{believed that they were}} rapidly becoming so), educating black students in physical proximity to white students would not result in better education. In addition, <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> about the demise of black schools and black teachers as a way to pass on cultural tradition to future generations of African Americans. She voiced this opposition in a letter, [...] "Court Order Can't Make the Races Mix", that was published in the Orlando Sentinel in August 1955. Hurston had not reversed her long-time opposition to segregation. Rather, she feared that the Court's ruling could become a precedent for an all-powerful federal government to undermine individual liberty on a broad range of issues in the future. Hurston also opposed preferential treatment for African-Americans, saying: ...|$|E

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown {{came under fire}} in November 2009 for describing Jedward as [...] "not very good" [...] and later apologised for doing so. Following this, Walsh stated [...] "So Gordon Brown and Simon Cowell both have something in common: neither of them know what the public want." [...] Former Prime Minister David Cameron admitted that he enjoyed watching The X Factor and that Jedward were his favourite act. Cameron also bought a T-shirt with their faces on it. The Irish Independent called Jedward [...] "tone-deaf twins", even though the pair were voted more popular than The Beatles in a teenage poll. Comedian Oliver Callan has parodied them on his RTÃ‰ 2 show Nob Nation.|$|E
2500|$|Following the January 1968 Tet {{offensive}} in Vietnam {{that resulted in}} a drop in President Johnson's poll numbers, Robert Kennedy's advisors urged him to enter the presidential race. When asked by Art Buchwald if he intended to run, Robert replied, [...] "That depends on what Jackie wants me to do". She met with him around this time, encouraging him to run after previously advising him to not follow his brother, but to [...] "be yourself". Privately, <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> about his safety, believing he was more disliked than her husband had been and that there was [...] "so much hatred" [...] in the United States. She confided in him about these feelings, but by her own account, he was [...] "fatalistic" [...] like her. Despite her concerns, Jacqueline campaigned for her brother-in-law and supported him, and at one point even showed outright optimism that through his victory, members of the Kennedy family would once again occupy the White House.|$|E
2500|$|According to Ratcliff, Sue getting {{pregnant}} {{put her in}} a dilemma because <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> that happiness for the Osmans would need to be curtailed if she decided to leave the programme; she felt this would be unfair on viewers because of all the misery Sue had been put through on-screen already. Discussing this in 1987, Ratcliff said, [...] "I knew nothing about the baby plans until a few weeks ago when I came back from my holidays and was told that Sue was pregnant again. Sue has gone through enough {{in the last couple of}} years. I'm glad she's got her dearest wish [...] I think she'll make a great mum and I'm sure Ali will be supportive. Hopefully, the storylines will open up for me, but it also means that if the pregnancy goes well and the baby is fine, it would be very difficult for me to leave without there being another tragedy in the Osman family. I don't think that would be fair on the show or the viewers." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, she {{ran for the}} 14th District seat in the Ohio Senate {{to replace}} Senate President Doug White, who was retiring. The Senate seat {{included}} Clermont, Brown, Adams and Scioto counties and part of Lawrence County. Her opponent for the Republican nomination was Tom Niehaus, a fellow member of the Ohio House from New Richmond whose 88th District represented the half of Clermont County outside her district plus Brown and Adams Counties to the east. Schmidt told the Enquirer [...] "The fear {{from many of the}} people I meet is that because the next senator will come from Clermont County, they will be underrepresented.

[...] The Enquirer was dismayed by advertisements from the Ohio Taxpayers Association [...] "twisting the two candidates' voting records to Schmidt's advantage" [...] and endorsed Niehaus.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1960, Rivers {{suffered}} from a stroke which left him paralysed down his right side.

When Rivers died on 28 March 1966, Amber was determined to keep living as normally as possible. She was visited by New Zealand historian Keith Sinclair who was writing a biography of her father, and twice by interviewers from the BBC. Although she enjoyed discussing politics and world affairs, she felt disillusioned about the socialist hopes of her youth, and supported the Conservatives in the 1970 election. She believed that the wrong people were leading the left and that only diehards would vote for them.|$|E
