50|$|The National Police Intelligence Service (Dienst IPOL) {{is a new}} {{department}} combining the former International Police Cooperation Service (Dienst Internationale Politiesamenwerking, DINPOL) and the National Criminal Intelligence Service (Dienst Nationale Recherche Informatie, DNRI). It is responsible for cooperation with foreign criminal investigation agencies playing {{a major role in}} tackling <b>serious</b> <b>cross-border</b> <b>crime.</b> Dutch and foreign police forces can contact IPOL for information on foreign and Dutch investigations respectively. The service manages the Dutch branches of Interpol, Europol and the Schengen Information System (SIS); at national level, the Sirene office of the SIS; the KLPD’s liaison officers abroad and foreign liaison officers in the Netherlands. Furthermore, it supplies criminal intelligence and expertise to the police forces. By maintaining databases containing data on crimes, criminal modes of operation and other information, IPOL helps to provide information on organized crime and serious forms of supra-regional crime. IPOL has several regional intelligence branch offices and criminal intelligence information desks which support the regional forces and core teams. IPOL develops new criminal investigation technologies and supports investigative teams by providing advice and expertise. It manages Edison (the image storage system for firearms and forged documents) developed by the former NRI and specializes in fingerprint identification. Finally, IPOL is responsible for production of the weekly TV crime-watch program ‘Opsporing Verzocht’.|$|E

40|$|To an {{ever-increasing}} extent, {{law enforcement agencies}} work with and rely on information obtained and passed to them by intelligence services. However, {{in comparison to the}} police, intelligent services face much less regulation or supervision. Contrasting levels of regulation and supervision pose a problem where the institutional and functional borders between intelligence and police agencies are increasingly blurred. For example: new ‘hybrid’ police-intelligence institutions have sprung up; information is freely exchanged between police and intelligence organisations; and information gathered by intelligence agencies is used in criminal proceedings. But an impulsive blurring of organisational boundaries is not a solution to growing fears of terrorism and <b>serious</b> <b>cross-border</b> <b>crime.</b> Secret or sensitive information should be used in a way that balances the need for intelligence gathering with the right of the defence to examine incriminating evidence...|$|E

50|$|Established in 2002, it {{was created}} to improve {{handling}} of <b>serious</b> <b>cross-border</b> and organized <b>crime</b> by stimulating investigative and prosecutorial co-ordination among agencies of the EU Member States. Eurojust is composed of a College formed of 28 National Members—experienced judges, prosecutors, or police officers of equivalent competence from each EU Member State. The terms and duties of the members are defined by the state that appoints them. Eurojust also co-operates with third states and other EU bodies such as the European Judicial Network, Europol, and OLAF.|$|R
40|$|The European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is a grossly coercive {{instrument}} {{that was designed}} for the persecution of <b>serious</b> <b>cross-border</b> <b>crimes.</b> In recent years, however, Member States have increasingly reported cases in which EAWs have not been issued for serious, but rather for harmless and minor offences. This article analyses the reasons behind the disproportionate use of the EAW and outlines measures to alleviate the problem. Thereby, it claims that in current debates different categories of disproportionate use of EAWs are often lumped together, and only concentrate on {{the introduction of a}} (binding) proportionality test, failing to consider other alternative legislative solutions regarding minor crimes, such as the introduction of new comparable and effective alternative measures. These, however, are considered to be crucial for an alleviation of disproportionate warrants. La orden de detención europea (ODE) es un instrumento extremadamente coercitivo que fue diseñado para la persecución de delitos transfronterizos graves. En años recientes, sin embargo, los Estados miembro han notificado cada vez más casos en los que la ODE no se debía a delitos serios, sino a casos menores e inofensivos [...] En este artículo se analizan las razones que hay detrás del uso desproporcionado de la orden de detención europea y propone medidas para paliar el problema. De esta manera, se defiende que el debate actual, frecuentemente agrupan diferentes categorías de uso desproporcionado de la ODE, y sólo se concentran en la introducción de un test de proporcionalidad (vinculante), sin tener en cuenta otras soluciones legislativas alternativas, en lo que respecta a delitos menores, como la introducción de nuevas medidas alternativas, comparables y eficaces. Sin embargo, se considera que estas medidas son cruciales para reducir las órdenes de arresto desproporcionadas. DOWNLOAD THIS PAPER FROM SSRN : [URL] </p...|$|R
40|$|Main {{results of}} the Council The Council reached a {{political}} agreement on a decision making the European Police Office, better known as Europol, an EU Agency with a community budget an a statute for its staff. The decision also extends Europol's mandate to all <b>serious</b> <b>cross-border</b> <b>crime.</b> Europol then will {{find it easier to}} come to the assistance of member states in cross-border criminal investigations. Political agreement was also reached on an EU action plan on improving the security of explosives. This action plan is one of a raft of measures proposed by the Commission in November 2007 to combat terrorism. The plan will improve the traceability of explosives in the EU, through, for example, the setting up of an alert system when explosives are stolen in a member state. Furthermore, the Council reached a general approach on a framework decision which aims at including into EU legislation three new crimes: public provocation to commit terrorist offences, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the European Union enshrined in 67 alin. (1) (ex-art. 61 TCE and ex-art. 29 TUE) of the consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union is to create a common European space of security and justice without internal frontiers, in which to ensure the free movement of people, corralated with appropriate measures on external border controls, asylum, immigration, and crime prevention and combating. This is a long term goal that requires active cooperation of Member States and multiple efforts by EU institutions. The institutional functioning practice has shown that the clasic forms of judicial cooperation do not have the ability to complete this objective and that is necessary to create specialized structures. In this context the First European institutional structure was established in 2002, a specialized agency of the European Union, named Eurojust, with the main objective to promote and improve coordination and cooperation between the judicial authorities of the Member States in the fight against <b>serious</b> <b>cross-border</b> <b>crime</b> affecting the European Union. Tasks of Eurojust and relations with other European bodies, particularly the Council and Commission are established by Decision 2002 / 187 / JHA amended by Decision 2009 / 426 / JHA Council of 16 December 2008 It is exercised by College Eurojust or through its national members. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} extent to which the {{development}} of instruments that implement the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters, particularly the European arrest warrant (EAW), may be considered valuable tools for effectively combating <b>cross-border</b> <b>crime</b> in the European Union. In addition, we assess how these policy orientations may or may not overcome the persistent mistrust and lack of confidence among the member states, while at the same time respecting human rights and civil liberties. In particular, this paper analyses: 1. EU judicial cooperation in criminal matters: does it fight and prevent <b>cross-border</b> <b>crime</b> effectively in the EU? 2. The European arrest warrant – is it an improved method to replace extradition? Does the EAW provide a better solution to the practical complexities and difficulties that characterise the current extradition system? What are the inherent gaps in the proposed new surrender procedure under the EAW? 3. Does the EAW guarantee a good balance between efficiency and judicial protection of the individual’s fundamental rights? Does the Green Paper on procedural safeguards for suspect sand defendants in criminal proceedings throughout the EU provide the right way forward? Does the EAW involve a real risk to the legal position and human rights of suspected individuals? 4. What is the added value of EU judicial cooperation against <b>cross-border</b> <b>crime...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{national}} {{diversity of}} Europe {{is reflected in}} the diversity of its criminal landscape and history. From the north of Scotland to Ukraine one finds different focal points and patterns of crimes and criminal entrepreneurs. This does not necessarily lead to a corresponding reaction of the authorities. Some responses are the result of a gradually developed form of cross-border cooperation, as is the case between Poland and Germany, other authorities appear carried away with emotional decision making and an inflexible political correctness as is observed in the field of the sex service industry. In another country, in the adjacent field of child trafficking, we find the converse: no response as victims are not labelled as such. And no victim label, no criminal law policy. Where the interactions between the upper- and underworld come into sight, this volume presents the reader with a select picture gallery of criminal faces: from corrupt football to remarkable criminal finances in Ukraine, to fraud and criminal abuse in the informal or quack health sector. Naturally, each face has its own pretences in order to hide its criminal background, be it large scale cannabis growing in the Netherlands or organised cybercrime from Romania to all countries in Europe. Indeed, the criminal portrait series in this <b>Cross-border</b> <b>Crime</b> Volume shows that criminal Europe does not lead to a boring uniformity, despite the fear of globalism.
