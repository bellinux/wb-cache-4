50|$|Pycnodontiform fishes lived {{mostly in}} shallow-water seas. They had <b>special</b> <b>jaws</b> with round and {{flattened}} teeth, well adapted to crush food items. One study links the dentine tubules in pycnodont teeth to comparable {{structures in the}} dermal denticles of early Paleozoic fish. Some species lived in rivers and possibly fed on molluscs and crustaceans.|$|E
50|$|This animal has a {{mouth with}} <b>special</b> <b>jaws</b> (Aristotle's lantern) {{located on the}} bottom (oral) surface. Its {{preferred}} diet is seaweeds and algae, which it scrapes off and tears up from the sea floor. During larval development, urchins use bands of cilia to capture food from the water column. Red sea urchins found in the channel adjacent to San Juan Island {{have been found to}} live a uniquely sedentary lifestyle with the heavy currents bringing an abundance of food.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} study of mechanical profile of three kinds of suture, between tendons with different dimensions. Were utilized 21 mongrel dogs (11 males, 10 females) of wich were obtained the tendon comum flexor and tendon tibial cranial of both pelvic limbs. After the dissection of the tendons, suture was done, seven animal per group. The tendons utilized allways were from the right limb and from the left limb side utilized as control. After the suture, we performed axial traction tests, rate level of 30 mm /min, using <b>special</b> <b>jaws.</b> After the test the machine's program informed the values of ultimate load, elongation and strain, and load elongation diagram. The results were submite to statistical study, that showed {{no difference between the}} technics utilized. The values of suture groups were smaller than the control, for ultimate load, and higher for elongation and strain...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} was {{developed}} for breaking high strength prestressed cable. The old method used an aluminum oxide grit packed into a <b>special</b> gripping <b>jaw.</b> The new method uses aluminum shims wrapped around the cable and then is gripped with a V-grip. The new method gives nearly 100 % "good breaks" on the cable compared to approximately 10 % good breaks with the old method. In addition, the new cable breaking method gives higher ultimate tensile strengths, is more reproducible, is quicker, cleaner and easier on equipment...|$|R

50|$|Sinoconodon rigneyi is {{an ancient}} mammaliamorph or early mammal (depending on {{systematic}} approach) that appears in the fossil record of China in the Sinemurian stage of the Early Jurassic period, about 193 million years ago. While in many traits very similar to non-mammalian synapsids, it possessed a <b>special,</b> secondarily evolved <b>jaw</b> joint between the dentary and the squamosal bones, which had replaced the primitive tetrapod one between the articular and quadrate bones, a trait commonly used to define mammals.|$|R
40|$|Gorlin {{syndrome}} is a dominant autosomal familial disorder. The manifestations begin {{at an early}} age and a combination of phenotypic abnormalities such <b>special</b> facial appearance, <b>jaw</b> cysts and skeletal anomalies are seen in this disease. A 22 -year-old woman referred to Zahedan Dental School complaining of pain on the left cheek. During the examination, several cutaneous lesions in the neck, pits in palm and sole and multiple jaw cysts were observed. According to the clinical symptoms, lesion biopsy and reports of Gorlin syndrome radiography were presented...|$|R
40|$|Inspections {{carried out}} on jaws of the LHC {{collimator}} prototype, which underwent the 450 GeV robustness test in CERN TT 40 extraction line, revealed no visible damage, except a permanent deformation of the jaw metal support of ~ 300 Pm. An explanation of this phenomenon is proposed in this paper. The temperature increase on the metal support induced by the thermal shock, though limited to ~ 70 ºC, led to a sudden expansion of the copper-based support which was partially prevented by the inertia of the material itself, thus generating compressive stresses exceeding the elastic limit of OFE-copper. An analytical assessment of the process, followed by a finite-element transient elasto-plastic analysis, is presented. Numerical results are in good agreement with measured data. In order to confirm this analysis, a <b>special</b> test on <b>jaws</b> from the series production, where OFE-copper {{has been replaced by}} Dispersion Strengthened Copper (Glidcop®), is scheduled for the second half of 2006...|$|R
5000|$|There is {{currently}} controversy {{about whether or}} not to classify Morganucodon as a mammal or as a non-mammalian mammaliaform. Some researchers limit the term [...] "mammal" [...] to the crown group mammals, which would not include Morganucodon and its relatives. Others, however, define [...] "mammals", as a group, by the possession of a <b>special,</b> secondarily evolved <b>jaw</b> joint between the dentary and the squamosal bones, which has replaced the primitive one between the articular and quadrate bones in all modern mammalian groups. Under this definition, Morganucodon would be a mammal. Nevertheless, its lower jaw retains some of the bones found in its non-mammalian ancestors in a very reduced form rather than being composed solely of the dentary. Furthermore, the primitive reptile-like jaw joint between the articular and quadrate bones, which in modern mammals has moved into the middle ear and become part of the ear ossicles as malleus and incus, is still to be found in Morganucodon. Morganucodon also suckled (it may have been the earliest animal to do so), had only two sets of teeth and grew rapidly to adult size and stopped growing thereafter, all typical mammalian traits.|$|R
40|$|We {{assess the}} effects of stretch rate on the {{mechanical}} properties of Prolene® (Ethicon, Gynecare, Somerville, NJ, USA), a knitted polypropylene mesh. Prolene®, consisting of macroporous knitted polypropylene, is considered here as a suitable proxy to midurethral tape (MUT) {{as well as to}} many other prosthesis products used in surgery applications. Such products are utilized to treat urine incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, as well as hernia in humans. Of the mechanical properties of special significance are the following three properties: peak load (N), extension (%) at peak load, and linear stiffness (N/mm). Uniaxial tensile testing was performed on mesh samples on a universal testing machine and involved loading different samples at 5 cross-head speeds of: 1, 10, 50, 100, and 500 mm/min. The corresponding properties were measured under these 5 conditions. In order to minimize damage to the specimens at the <b>jaws,</b> <b>special</b> dual action pneumatically operated grips with rubber faced jaws were used to hold the samples in place. The effectiveness of these grips was illustrated by the fact that none of the failed samples broke at grips. Statistically significant findings suggest an increasing trend for Prolene® stiffness vs. stretch rate (R 2 = 0. 9679; two-tailed p value = 0. 0025) where the stiffness increases 26. 2 % when increasing the displacement rate from 1 to 500 mm/min. For extension (%) at peak load, a decreasing trend was found vs. stretch rate (R 2 = 0. 81; two-tailed p value = 0. 037) where increasing the displacement rate from 1 mm/min to 500 mm/min corresponds to a 22 % decrease in the relative elongation of the mesh. No statistically significant dependence of peak load on stretch rate was found. These findings may help workers in the biomedical field develop suitable uniaxial tensile testing protocols of such materials. N/...|$|R
