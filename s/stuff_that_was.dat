500|$|The band {{took the}} {{approach}} of recording one song at a time, and agreed with O'Brien to mix the songs as each one was finished. O'Brien had the band members set up {{much as they do}} live, and most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. Guitarist Stone Gossard said, [...] "I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented sort of way, rather than me bringing in a bunch of <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> already arranged." [...] Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, [...] "You could tell when the music wanted to change just by the way he was singing." [...] In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, [...] " [...] was probably where it felt better recording wise. I saw how it could change and evolve which gave me a lot of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast stuff, we can do slow stuff, we can do punk <b>stuff.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> where I realized there were gonna be a lot of places to go with Ed." ...|$|E

Buck had just bought the instrument and was attempting {{to learn how to}} play it, recording the music as he practiced. Buck said that [...] "when I listened back to it the next day, there was a bunch of <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> really just me learning how to play mandolin, and then there's what became 'Losing My Religion', and then a whole bunch more of me learning to play the mandolin." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{script was}} significantly {{longer than the}} one used during filming, and featured a series of lengthy monologues; it was edited on-set by the cast and script supervisor, who found much of the dialogue incomprehensible. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, one anonymous cast member commented that the script contained [...] "stuff that was just unsayable. I know it's hard to imagine there was <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> worse. But there was". Sestero mentions that Wiseau was adamant characters say their lines {{the way they were}} written, but that several cast members managed to slip in ad libs that ended up in the final cut of the film.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack to {{the film}} was {{released}} on [...] 28 April 1997 on Mercury Records Australia. Vidler {{said a lot of}} time was spend sifting through hundred of CDs [...] "trying to find <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not only appropriate for the film but would also be appealing to the audiences and hopefully, you know, would be released around {{the same time as the}} film, which isn't as easy as it sounds!" [...] Jonathan Lewis from AllMusic gave the album four and a half out of five stars, concluding that it was [...] "A fine collection of songs that, given the diversity of artists featured, is surprisingly cohesive as an album." ...|$|E
500|$|Halo 2s soundtrack was {{composed}} primarily by Martin O'Donnell and his musical partner Michael Salvatori, {{the team that}} had composed the critically acclaimed music of Halo. O'Donnell noted in composing the music for Halo 2 that [...] "Making a sequel is never a simple proposition. You want to make everything that was cool even better, and leave out all the <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> weak." [...] O'Donnell made sure that {{no part of the}} game would be completely silent, noting [...] "Ambient sound {{is one of the main}} ways to immerse people psychologically. A dark room is spooky, but add a creaking floorboard and rats skittering in the walls and it becomes really creepy." [...] Halo 2, unlike its predecessor, was mixed to take full advantage of Dolby 5.1 Digital surround sound.|$|E
500|$|Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said {{although}} {{he liked the}} pilot episode, he thought jokes in [...] "Canvassing" [...] were [...] "pretty thin on the ground", the supporting cast lacked good material and the Leslie character was less likable than the previous week. Phipps, who gave the episode a C grade, said, [...] "This wasn’t a terrible half-hour of comedy by any stretch. It drifted by easily enough. But I’m already having to scour my notes to remind myself of the <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> funny." [...] "Canvassing" [...] was first broadcast in Australia on Channel Seven on December 8, 2009, and received a positive review from The Sydney Morning Herald writer Mark Ellis. He particularly praised Poehler and Ansari, and said of the episode, [...] "Tune in just to hear her say to her canvassing companion, who complains it's hot and wants to cool off: 'We could blow in each other's faces.'" ...|$|E
50|$|Stove Top <b>is</b> a <b>stuffing</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} by General Foods in 1972 (merging with Kraft in 1990 to form Kraft General Foods). It {{is a quick}} cooking ("instant") <b>stuffing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> available in supermarkets. Unlike traditional stuffing, Stove Top can be prepared on the stove, in a pot. It {{is used as a}} side dish for meals as well as a medium in which some meats (pork, chicken) can be baked. It is sold in boxes and canisters.

500|$|Wolfgang's {{original}} intention {{with the}} album {{was to create a}} collection of previously released b-sides along with three reworked demos, with Eddie saying: [...] "It would [...] a record of our more hardcore songs and none of the pop <b>stuff.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> the initial plan, but the deeper we dug, the more we found. At the same time I was writing new songs. Dave got very excited about that. We all did. We ended up recording demos for 35 songs." [...] After deliberating over whether to self-produce the album or choose a producer from a list that included Rick Rubin and Pat Leonard, Roth suggested John Shanks. Shanks liked the first three songs, and agreed to produce the album, working alongside Wolfgang to pick the demos that would be developed into the album's tracks. While all of Van Halen's albums since 1984 had been produced inside 5150, Roth persuaded the band to work at Henson Recording Studios—where he had been recording for over a decade.|$|E
500|$|The group's primary musical {{influences}} {{came from}} bands such as Buzzcocks, The Jam, Madness and The Kinks. Supergrass took this contemporary music and mixed it with pop punk's characteristic fast, three-chord, guitar-based, catchy tunes {{to produce a}} sound uniquely their own; [...] "we were just {{the three of us}} in my bedroom or someone's house, just making... we played really hard and just made loads of noise. Most of our early songs were just three chord grooves and <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> fun to play. So that's why the first album sounded so 'punky', I think... it's just 'cause we were all used to playing in this small room and it being really loud, so we just made the album sound like that." [...] Songs for Beginners by Graham Nash was another possible influence on I Should Coco. Gaz Coombes told The Guardian in 2003, [...] "We used to listen to it a lot when we lived in Cowley Road in Oxford in 1994, just when the band were getting big." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by James Foley, who worked with Madonna in her music video for [...] "Live to Tell", produced by David Naylor and Sharon Oreck, and Michael Ballhaus {{was in charge of}} the photography. The video was shot on location over three days in Staten Island, New York and Manhattan. Staten Island was chosen on Foley's suggestion as it was where he grew up: [...] "We talked about wanting to tap into a working-class environment, because by that time she had done 'Material Girl' and 'Like a Virgin' and other <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> very glamorous and stylized. She wanted to do something a bit more grounded and 'drama'." [...] Actor Alex McArthur was signed to play Madonna's boyfriend and the father of her child in the video. Madonna had spotted McArthur in a small role as a naive youth in the 1985 film Desert Hearts, and she thought he was a natural to play her mechanic boyfriend. [...] "I was out in the garage working on my Harley," [...] said McArthur, [...] "I answered the phone and a voice said, 'Hi, this is Madonna. I would like you to be in my next video.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{wrote that}} the episode was [...] "just right" [...] for the series, and that it {{highlighted}} the fact that [...] "the ending was more {{about the fact that}} you took a journey with these characters." [...] He wrote that all of the character's subplots had emotion, even if they appeared slightly contrived. Ultimately he concluded that [...] "it felt okay to say goodbye because it was the right atmosphere." [...] James Poniewozik of Time {{wrote that the}} finale was [...] "touching, sweet, funny, messy, a little manipulative. And in the end, it worked." [...] He found that [...] "The <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> like latter-seasons Office", such as Andy and Dwight's antics, were [...] "all right" [...] but that [...] "the stuff that recalled the sweep of the whole series was wonderful." [...] Poniewozik was slightly critical of Pam and Jim's story, noting that in the grand scheme of the show it was successful, but that it makes slightly less sense when one examines it closely; however, he felt that even [...] "if the details don't add up, the emotions do". He concluded that the episode [...] "worked mostly as an epilogue" [...] and allowed the cast of the series to have their final moments.|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} {{failure of}} Warner's previous animated effort, Quest for Camelot, {{which made the}} studio reconsider animated films, helped shape The Iron Giants production considerably. [...] "Three-quarters" [...] of the animation team on that team helped craft The Iron Giant. By the time it entered production, Warner Bros. informed the staff {{that there would be}} a smaller budget as well as time-frame to get the film completed. Although the production was watched closely, Bird commented [...] "They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> good." [...] Bird regarded the trade-off as having [...] "one-third of the money of a Disney or DreamWorks film, and half of the production schedule," [...] but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as [...] "fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can say that to the level that we can." [...] A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to Maine, where they photographed and videotaped five small cities. They hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to the minutiae; [...] "we shot store fronts, barns, forests, homes, home interiors, diners, every detail we could, including the bark on trees," [...] said production designer Mark Whiting.|$|E
500|$|Some of the album's {{songs were}} {{recorded}} by Saadiq with his live band, which included drummer Lemar Carter, bassist Calvin Turner, and guitarist Rob Bacon. Bacon, {{who had played}} with Saadiq since 2002, said of their grittier approach to guitar, [...] "I have relative pitch, as opposed to perfect pitch, so there'd be times when I'd spend 15 or 20 minutes tuning my instrument. Then he'd come in and pick up his guitar and just start playing it however it was left the day before. On one of the tracks I had to play over all this <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> out of tune. Raphael was like, 'That's what makes it funky!'". Musical guests such as vocalist Yukimi Nagano, keyboardist Larry Dunn, bass player Larry Graham, keyboardist Amp Fiddler, and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph {{also contributed to the}} album's recording sessions, with Saadiq selecting their parts for certain tracks. The song [...] "Go to Hell" [...] was conceived from one of Amp Fiddler's Mellotron ideas. Saadiq recorded a duet with Graham called [...] "The Perfect Storm", included as a hidden track on the album: [...] "I played bass, but I put my bass down [...] The first day I tried to play bass for him, I couldn't even play. I froze three times. He's my all-time idol!".|$|E

5000|$|In V. Gordon Childe's scheme {{the social}} surplus exists first, {{and then the}} ruling class arises to exploit this surplus. This view assumes that there exists a set {{quantity}} of <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> needed for social reproduction, and that once primary producers make more than this amount, they have produced a social surplus. There does not, however, exist a set amount of <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> necessary for social or biological reproduction. The amount and quality of calories, protein, clothing, shelter, education, and other things needed to reproduce the primary producers can vary enormously {{from time to time}} and place to place. The division between necessary and surplus labour reflects an underlying relationship, class, when one group, an elite class, has the power to take labor or the products of labor from another, the primary producers. This relationship defines social surplus".|$|R
500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, and I go on my notes and every time I see {{something}} I like I write it down, {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to someone I know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{none of the}} parties, {{save for}} perhaps Gene Clark, seemed willing to {{contribute}} their best material to the album, instead holding back their finest songs for their own individual solo projects. [...] This has been confirmed by Hillman, who told author John Einarson [...] "I'll be honest, I contributed my worst material because I {{was getting ready to}} do a solo record, Slipping Away, and I was saving all my good stuff and contributed this throwaway <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> awful. Crosby's stuff was sketchy and Roger had 'Born To Rock & Roll', which was terrible, yuck." [...] McGuinn also supported the suggestion that some band members had held back their best material, although he added [...] "I don't think I was guilty of that. I gave them my best stuff at the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{aimed to}} create the {{animations}} to resemble Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls, and initially started off with shorts that featured competitions between Homestar Runner as a heroic character and Strong Bad as the villain, but these did not really capture viewers. Mike and Matt {{came up with the}} idea of animating the scenes between competitions; Matt stated [...] "that was the <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> funnier, the stuff happening between the plot points, which is hilarious because we hadn't even established a routine of making cartoons about competitions, we’d made like one". From May 2000 to February 2001, the website and cartoons started out with different art styles. In February 2001, it gained a new look, which has largely remained consistent to the present with minor changes.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after {{completing}} the album, Dylan became seriously ill with near-fatal histoplasmosis. His forthcoming tour was canceled, and {{he spent most of}} June 1997 in excruciating pain. A potentially serious condition (caused by the fungal infection histoplasma capsulatum), it makes breathing very difficult. [...] "It was something called histoplasmosis that came from just accidentally inhaling a bunch of <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> out on one of the rivers by where I live," [...] said Dylan. [...] "Maybe one month, or two to three days out of the year, the banks around the river get all mucky, and then the wind blows and a bunch of swirling mess is in the air. I happened to inhale a bunch of that. That's what made me sick. It went into my heart area, but it wasn't anything really attacking my heart," [...] Dylan told Guitar World magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Stewart aired archive {{footage of}} Cramer admitting to {{the ease of}} {{manipulating}} markets and commented that Cramer's on-air personality lacks honesty: [...] "I understand {{you want to make}} finance entertaining, but it's not a fucking game. And when I watch that, I get, I can't tell you how angry that makes me. Because what it says to me is: you all know. You all know what's going on. You know, you can draw a straight line from those shenanigans to the <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> being pulled at Bear, and AIG, and all this derivative market stuff that is this weird Wall Street side bet."
