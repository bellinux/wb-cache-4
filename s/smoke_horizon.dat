60|$|Syme {{understood}} his rude impatience and instinctively {{looked over his}} shoulder to see whether the train was coming in sight. But there was no <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{upper layer}} {{is a term}} {{commonly}} given to the collection of smoke and heated gases during the progression of the fire near the upper regions of the compartment, typically near the ceiling. The high temperature gases and soot in the upper layer influences the patterns formed on lining materials of the compartment and contents. The damage caused by this upper layer is often times referred to as hot gas layer-generated fire patterns or heat and <b>smoke</b> <b>horizons</b> (NFPA 2014; DeHaan and Icove 2011), but in this work it will be described as upper layer-generated patterns (ULG patterns). The literature identified that investigators use the damage in two different ways. First, the upper layer-generated fire patterns are used by investigators in determining {{the extent to which}} the upper layer has descended in the compartment and that, because it is a heat source, is used to help describe other areas of damage within the compartment.|$|R
25|$|Streeton's {{most famous}} war painting, Amiens {{the key of}} the west shows the Amiens {{countryside}} with dirty plumes of battlefield <b>smoke</b> staining the <b>horizon,</b> which becomes a subtle image of war.|$|R
60|$|Towards evening, {{when the}} dust of {{returning}} kine made all the <b>horizons</b> <b>smoke,</b> came the lama and Mahbub Ali, both afoot, walking cautiously, for the house had told them where he had gone.|$|R
60|$|The breeze had {{increased}} considerably, {{and as the}} <b>smoke</b> upon the <b>horizon</b> was now plainly discernible in considerable volume, the mutineers lost no time in getting under full sail and bearing away toward the southwest.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the Emden's arrival, the British {{wireless}} operators {{spotted her}} <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon</b> {{and sent a}} wireless message stating an unknown ship was approaching. [...] heard the alert and proceeded to Cocos, where she encountered and disabled the Emden.|$|R
25|$|On 4 July 1943, Jack {{began to}} track <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon</b> and soon {{detected}} Nikkyo Maru with an escort. The submarine used three torpedoes {{to send the}} cargo ship to the bottom, and returned to Pearl Harbor for repairs 19 July 1943.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what's that, I wonder?" [...] she mused. To see <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon</b> in that {{direction}} was unusual, though out toward Durango the grassy benches would often burn over. And these low clouds of smoke resembled those she had seen before.|$|R
60|$|But I didn't {{have much}} chance to enjoy my hatred then, for almost {{immediately}} the lookout poked his face over the hatchway and bawled down {{that there was}} <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon,</b> dead ahead. Immediately I went on deck to investigate, and Bradley came with me.|$|R
60|$|One morning, at the {{beginning}} of his fourth month of solitude, the mucker saw a smudge of <b>smoke</b> upon the <b>horizon.</b> Slowly it increased in volume and the speck beneath it resolved itself into the hull of a steamer. Closer and closer to the island it came.|$|R
50|$|On May 22, 2007, from {{southern}} Georgia to Metro Atlanta, residents awoke to {{a blanket of}} <b>smoke</b> across the <b>horizon.</b> A strong <b>smoke</b> smell was very clear, and {{there were reports of}} people with irritated eyes, noses, and lungs. Some people with asthma were rushed to hospitals {{as a result of the}} smoke.|$|R
50|$|Rendezvousing on 13 July, the {{remaining}} boats resumed the hunt. At 16:00 on 16 July, Thresher sighted <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon.</b> She surfaced and dispatched a contact report. After a cat-and-mouse period of some two hours, she noted the convoy consisted of six ships: a large tanker, three freighters, and two escorts.|$|R
6000|$|At half-past seven Tom espied a {{cloud of}} <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon.</b> [...] "I think it's a lake steamer," [...] {{he said to his}} brother, and he proved to be right. It was a {{freighter}} known as the Captain Rallow, running between Detroit and Buffalo. Soon the steamer came closer and they hailed her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] said Monsieur Thuran, [...] "you see {{the fate}} that awaits us all {{unless we are}} picked up {{within a day or}} two. That there is little hope of that is {{evidenced}} by the fact that during all the days we have drifted we have seen no sail, nor the faintest smudge of <b>smoke</b> upon the <b>horizon.</b>|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, Demented chafes. Conceives {{that every}} man's hand is against him, and exerting itself to prevent his getting to Paris. Refuses consolation. Rattles door. Sees <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon,</b> and 'knows' it's the boat gone without him. Monied Interest resentfully {{explains}} that HE {{is going to}} Paris too. Demented signifies, that if Monied Interest chooses to be left behind, HE don't.|$|R
60|$|So now, in the Autumn of 1791, {{looking from}} the sky-windows of Cap Francais, thick clouds of <b>smoke</b> girdle our <b>horizon,</b> <b>smoke</b> in the day, {{in the night}} fire; preceded by {{fugitive}} shrieking white women, by Terror and Rumour. Black demonised squadrons are massacring and harrying, with nameless cruelty. They fight and fire 'from behind thickets and coverts,' for the Black man loves the Bush; they rush to the attack, thousands strong, with brandished cutlasses and fusils, with caperings, shoutings and vociferation,--which, if the White Volunteer Company stands firm, dwindle into staggerings, into quick gabblement, into panic flight at the first volley, perhaps before it. (Deux Amis, x. 157.) Poor Oge could be broken on the wheel; this fire-whirlwind too can be abated, driven up into the Mountains: but Saint-Domingo is shaken, as Oge's seedgrains were; shaking, writhing in long horrid death-throes, it is Black without remedy; and remains, as African Haiti, a monition to the world.|$|R
60|$|One morning, peeping {{through a}} big {{telescope}} that was fixed {{in the window}} of the little boudoir which formed an entrance lobby to the museum, Mrs. Carr saw a cloud of <b>smoke</b> upon the <b>horizon.</b> Presently the point of a mast poked up through the vapour as though the vessel were rising out of the ocean, then two more mastheads and a red and black funnel, and last of all a great grey hull.|$|R
6000|$|... "That will be {{the other}} Line's {{intermediate}} boat," [...] he said, and the passengers, craning their heads round, saw far away to the right a streak of <b>smoke</b> upon the <b>horizon.</b> Orders were given, a little corner of sail was hoisted, with a white cloth of some sort tied above it, and the oars were got out. Once more the cutter moved forward, bearing to the left {{in the hope of}} intercepting the steamer.|$|R
50|$|OS2U Kingfisher floatplanes of the US Scouting Squadron VS-57, from New Caledonia, {{joined the}} search and one of these planes {{indicated}} that Tui should investigate <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon.</b> The submarine was sighted {{on the surface and}} Tui opened fire at maximum range, scoring one and possibly two hits. The two shells exploded forward of her periscope, I-17 was severely damaged, and slid beneath the waves, leaving a trail of air bubbles and oil marking her path.|$|R
5|$|Five minutes later, the Allied ships spotted {{clouds of}} <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon</b> and Acton ordered the Italian ships to attack shortly {{afterwards}} {{while the two}} British cruisers turned {{to cut off the}} two Austrian destroyers. Aquila opened fire at 08:15 at long range, but inflicted no damage before she was immobilised by a hit at 08:32 that detonated inside her central boiler room and severed her main steam pipe. The Austrian ships managed to disengage before the cruisers could close the distance.|$|R
50|$|When Drew awakens, he wanders alone, {{swearing}} that he'll kill Jake {{if he ever}} {{sees him}} again. Seeing <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon,</b> he investigates, {{only to find that}} it {{was the result of a}} burning barn, set afire during a raid by Big Joe. Before he is hanged for taking part in the raid, one of Joe's men confirms to Drew that Jake has joined up with the gang. Drew joins the posse in order to get his revenge on Jake.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} morning of 13 December 1939, a force {{consisting}} of Achilles, Ajax and Exeter detected <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon,</b> which was confirmed at 06:16 to be a pocket battleship, {{thought to be the}} [...] but {{which turned out to be}} [...] A fierce battle ensued, at a range of approximately 20 km. Achilles suffered some damage. In the exchange of fire, four crew were killed, her captain, W. E. Parry, was wounded; 36 of Graf Spee’s crew were killed.|$|R
60|$|The {{night had}} grown still {{except for the}} murmuring of the men. <b>Smoke</b> veiled the <b>horizon.</b> Kurt felt an intense and terrible loneliness. He was indeed alone in the world. A hard, tight {{contraction}} of throat choked back a sob. If only {{he could have had}} a word with his father! But no grief, nothing could detract from the splendid truth of his father's last message. In the black hours soon to come Kurt would have that to sustain him.|$|R
60|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} I sighted a steamer’s <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon</b> to leeward, and I knew it either for a Russian cruiser, or, more likely, the Macedonia still seeking the Ghost. The sun had not shone all day, {{and it had been}} bitter cold. As night drew on, the clouds darkened and the wind freshened, so that when Maud and I ate supper it was with our mittens on and with me still steering and eating morsels between puffs.|$|R
60|$|The steamer we {{had just}} sighted must have wirelessed a warning, for it wasn't {{half an hour before}} we saw more <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon,</b> and this time the vessel flew the white ensign of the Royal Navy and carried guns. She didn't veer to the north or {{anywhere}} else, but bore down on us rapidly. I was just preparing to signal her, when a flame flashed from her bows, and an instant later the water in front of us was thrown high by the explosion of a shell.|$|R
60|$|It {{has often}} since been a {{comfortable}} thought {{to me that}} we had thus destroyed the tell-tale remnants of the Flying Scud; and often a strange one that my last sight and reminiscence of that fatal ship should be a pillar of <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon.</b> To so many others besides myself the same appearance had played a part in the various stages of that business; luring some to what they little imagined, filling some with unimaginable terrors. But ours was the last smoke raised in the story; and with its dying away the secret of the Flying Scud became a private property.|$|R
50|$|Tampa resumed convoy operations, {{performing}} local escort in the Greenland {{area for}} the remainder of February 1943. She continued these operations through the spring. On 12 June 1943, she departed Narsarssuak with four other escorts, escorting a three-ship convoy for Argentia. The next day, at 0508, she observed <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon,</b> and received a report that Escanaba was afire. In fact, Escanaba had been blown to bits by an explosion of undetermined origin. Only three survivors were picked up by Raritan (WYT-93), and one of these died. The other two could not explain what had destroyed their ship.|$|R
5000|$|She {{transferred}} the rescued British fliers to submarine [...] on 1 August. On 5 August, while patrolling her lifeguard area for planes returning from bomber raids on the Japanese islands, Toro sighted dense black <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon</b> and, receiving {{reports of a}} downed pilot in the area, put on all possible speed to investigate {{the source of the}} smoke. Less than 20 minutes later, she picked up an Army aviator afloat in his lifeboat impressively marked by a smoke display. Minutes later, a second Army aviator jumped from his plane nearby, and again Toro had a flier on board within seven minutes of the time his parachute opened.|$|R
25|$|The next day, Balao {{investigated}} <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon,</b> {{found two}} cargo ships, tracked {{them through a}} rain squall, and as she passed into clear weather, found the convoy in perfect position for her torpedoes. She fired four stern tubes at the leading ship, but heard no explosions. The torpedoes were duds or had again passed underneath. As the escorts actively pursued the submarine, Balao submerged {{to wait out the}} inevitable depth charges. When the submarine surfaced again, all trace of the convoy was gone, and she set course for Langemak Bay, New Guinea, with all her torpedoes expended. On 7 March, Balao moored alongside Coucal and took on fuel and provisions. She got underway again on the following morning, bound for Pearl Harbor where she arrived for refit on 19 March.|$|R
25|$|Souchon had {{replenished}} his coal off the Aegean {{island of}} Donoussa on 9 August, and the German warships resumed their voyage to Constantinople. At 17:00 on 10 August, {{he reached the}} Dardanelles and awaited permission to pass through. Germany had for some time been courting the Committee of Union and Progress of the imperial government, and it now used its influence to pressure the Turkish Minister of War, Enver Pasha, into granting the ship′s passage, an act that would outrage Russia, which relied on the Dardanelles as its main all-season shipping route. In addition, the Germans managed to persuade Enver to order any pursuing British ships to be fired on. By the time Souchon received permission to enter the straits, his lookouts could see <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon</b> from approaching British ships.|$|R

5000|$|On 19 August 1943, while escorting {{a convoy}} from Noumea, Tui {{picked up a}} {{submarine}} contact. She made an initial run over it without using depth charges, a second run dropping two depth charges, and a third run throwing another two depth charges. Contact was lost and Tui signaled some US seaplanes who joined the search. A plane indicated that Tui should investigate <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon.</b> The submarine was sighted {{on the surface and}} Tui opened fire at maximum range, scoring one and possibly two hits.

Tui picked up six survivors who said that Tui's depth charge attacks had damaged the submarine and forced it to the surface.|$|R
60|$|He {{thought it}} best, however, not to proceed {{directly}} to his destination, {{and it was}} three days later when he ran in behind a point, and anchored in shallow water. It was daylight, but the Enchantress's gray hull and slender spars {{would be hard to}} see against the land, and {{there was no sign of}} habitation on the sweep of desolate coast. A cliff rose behind the steamer, and then for some miles the dazzling sea broke in a fringe of lace-like foam on a beach of yellow sand. On the landward side of this, glossy-green jungle rolled away and merged into taller forest that was presently lost in haze. No <b>smoke</b> streaked the <b>horizon,</b> and there was not a boat on the beach, but while Grahame carefully watched, two appeared from behind a reef, and he put down his glasses with a smile.|$|R
50|$|On 19 July, Tullibee got {{underway}} for the Western Caroline Islands and {{her first}} war patrol. On 28 July, she sighted a passenger-cargo ship, accompanied by an escort and an aircraft that prevented her attack. On 5 August, the submarine began patrolling the Saipan-Truk traffic lanes. Five days later, she sighted <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon</b> {{that proved to be}} three freighters with an escort. Tullibee closed the range to 2700 yd; launched one torpedo at the ship on the right and three at the vessel on the left. As the submarine fired the first torpedo, a ship rammed her and bent her number one periscope. She went deep and was depth charged by the escort as the ships sped away. As the torpedoes had been set to run at a depth of 15 ft — too deep for the draft of the largest target — none of the torpedoes exploded.|$|R
5000|$|On August 11, {{they reached}} the {{mountain}} of the Horse People. {Smith proposed that this was White Butte, North Dakota. He {{thought that it was}} at the right distance, but Smurr claimed it was too close for a 20-day journey and suggested one of several small peaks in southeastern Montana, 250 to 300 miles from the Mandan villages, or the highly distinctive Devil's Tower in Wyoming.} Since the guides would go no further they built a camp and lit signal fires. A month later, on 14 September they saw <b>smoke</b> on the <b>horizon</b> and contacted the Handsome People (Beaux Hommes) {perhaps Crow or Blackfeet} and stayed with them for 21 days. On October 9, they headed south southwest with a Beau Homme guide. On 11 October they meet the Little Foxes (Petits Renards) {possibly a branch of the Cheyennes} and on 15 October the 'Pioya' {Kiowa?}.|$|R
