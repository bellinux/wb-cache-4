40|$|Abstract: Based on the {{fabrication}} methods of forging, drilling and welding, the cooling channels in ITER <b>shield</b> <b>block</b> are drilled radial holes with flow drives. In the old design of FDR 2001, the {{pressure drop in}} the poloidal hole was very high and {{it was difficult to}} achieve uniform flow distribution in the radial holes. In recent years, great improvements in the blanket design were made by ITER international team. Hydraulic and thermal studies on ITER shield blanket module was also carried out by SWIP to assess the hydraulic performance and cooling efficiency, and the flow drives was optimized to achieve “uniform ” flow distribution. When some improvements and optimizations were done, the current blanket design was confirmed to satisfy the design requirements according to the results from the analyses...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of municipal waste as a fuel is marked mainly by its hetero-geneous composition and relatively poor heating value. Two solutions {{have been proposed}} for its combustion, namely, in the form {{in which it is}} delivered, or after some type of preparation. Whichever solution is chosen, refuse boilers must contain certain features aimed specifically at the prevention of corrosion and fouling. Studies and investigations carried out over a 10 -year period have achieved installations characterized by high and stable efficiency, excellent availability, and low maintenance costs. After a research of curative measures to be applied to existing plants (<b>shield</b> <b>block,</b> refractory concrete), the survey has been directed towards a research of pre-ventive measures to be taken for new plants. These surveys have been principally based upon statistics in existing plants, evolution of the thermal balance-sheets in current operation, the physico-chemical analysis of fly ash, research of correlation between measurements of combustion chambers and phenomena of corrosion and fouling in convection banks.

This paper presents the CAD-based MCNP Monte Carlo radiation transport and activation analyses for the Diagnostic Upper and Equatorial Port Plugs (UPP # 3 and EPP # 8, # 17). The creation process of the complicated 3 D MCNP models of the diagnostics systems was substantially accelerated by application of the CAD-to-MCNP converter programs MCAM and McCad.

40|$|Protons are {{the most}} {{abundant}} element in the galactic cosmic radiation, and the energy spectrum peaks around 1 GeV. Shielding of relativistic protons is therefore a key problem in the radiation protection strategy of crewmembers involved in long-term missions in deep space. Hydrogen ions were accelerated up to 1 GeV at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York. The proton beam was also shielded with thick (about 20 g/cm(2)) blocks of lucite (PMMA) or aluminium (Al). We found that the dose rate was increased 40 - 60 % by the shielding and decreased {{as a function of}} the distance along the axis. Simulations using the General Purpose Particle and Heavy-Ion Transport code System (PHITS) show that the dose increase is mostly caused by secondary protons emitted by the target. The modified radiation Weld after the shield has been characterized for its biological eVectiveness by measuring chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes exposed just behind the <b>shield</b> <b>block,</b> or to the direct beam, in the dose range 0. 53 Gy. Notwithstanding the increased dose per incident proton, the fraction of aberrant cells at the same dose in the sample position was not significantly modified by the shield. The PHITS code simulations show that, albeit secondary protons are slower than incident nuclei, the LET spectrum is still contained in the low-LET range (< 10 keV/mu m), which explains the approximately unitary value measured for the relative biological effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|The ITER blanket-shield {{system is}} the {{innermost}} part of the reactor directly exposed to the plasma. Its basic function is to provide the main thermal and nuclear shielding to the vacuum vessel and external reactor components. Its concept is a modular configuration: the different modules consist of a water-cooled stainless-steel <b>shield</b> <b>block,</b> on which a separable first wall (FW) panel is mounted. The FW panels, having typically the dimensions of 1 m x 1. 5 m, consist of a complex structure, where the plasma-facing beryllium tiles are cooled by water at the pressure of 40 bar and inlet temperature of 70 °C, which flows in parallel ducts, called fingers, {{on the back of}} the tiles. The duct configuration can span from the rectangular hypervapotron geometry to the regular circular tube, according to the level of power deposition from the plasma. We concentrate on the panel of the FW blanket module # 6, for which the maximum power density foreseen during operation is ~ 2 MW/m 2 allowing the use of the circular tube. Here, in the second of two companion papers, we concentrate on the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the panel. Starting from the optimized design obtained from the hydraulic analysis - part I of this study - we start analyzing the finger geometry, to assess at which level the computed evolution of the temperature field in the structure is influenced by the details of the model of the cooling pipe and coolant. Based on the results of this first step, the thermal (-hydraulic) analysis of the entire panel is carried out, considering two full plasma cycles.

50|$|In {{order to}} satisfy the request of a {{radiation}} oncologist to include five blocks in the field, in August 2000 the method of digitizing <b>shielding</b> <b>blocks</b> was changed.

The result was that patients received a proportionately higher dose than that prescribed.

The aim of this analysis is to localize the stagnant regions inside the module and to compute the pressure drop across each finger and across the whole panel. Based on the computed results, an optimization of the panel geometry is proposed, that should achieve a more homogeneous distribution of the flow among the fingers, minimizing at the same time the stagnant regions and the pressure drop. ...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the differences in}} palliative radiotherapy for painful bone metastases amongst different Western European countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 565 radiotherapy centres in 19 Western European countries, based on the 1997 ESTRO directory. In this questionnaire the current local palliative radiotherapy practice for bone metastases was assessed in terms of total dose, fractionation, treatment complexity (use of <b>shielding</b> <b>blocks,</b> frequency of isodose calculations, field set-up) and type of machine used. The differences were analyzed according {{to the country and}} to the type and size of radiotherapy centre. RESULTS: A total of 205 centres (36 %) returned the questionnaire, of which 198 could be further analyzed. The most frequently used antalgic fractionation schedule is 30 Gy in ten daily fractions of 3 Gy (50 %), single fractions and conventional 2 Gy fractions being used in a minority of the centres (respectively, 11 and 9 %). Most antalgic treatments are performed on a linear accelerator (67 % of the centres uses linear accelerators) and 64 % of the centres predominantly uses a two-field set-up. The majority of the centres uses <b>shielding</b> <b>blocks</b> and performs isodose calculations in less than 50 % of the patients, (respectively, 88 and 81 %). There is a correlation between the centre size and the palliative irradiation practice, the largest centres using more hypofractionation (chi(2) : P= 0. 001; logit: P= 0. 0003) and a less complex treatment set up as expressed by the use of isodose calculations (chi(2) : P= 0. 027; logit: P= 0. 0161). There is also a tendency to use less <b>shielding</b> <b>blocks</b> (P= 0. 177). The same goes for university centres as compared with private centres: university centres use shorter fractionation schedules (chi(2) : P= 0. 008; logit: P= 0. 0094), less isodoses (chi(2) : P= 0. 010; logit: P= 0. 0115) and somewhat less <b>shielding</b> <b>blocks</b> (P= 0. 151). Amongst the analyzed countries different tendencies in fractionation (P= 0. 001) and treatment complexity are observed (use of isodoses: P= 0. 014, use of shielding blocks: P= 0. 001). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that beside work-load and clinical evidence, country-related factors such as tradition and habits, past teaching, the national organization of health care and reimbursement criteria may influence the local practice. status: publishe...|$|R
