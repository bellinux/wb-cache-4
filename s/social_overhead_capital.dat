Still, many corporations {{were able to}} reduce production costs and achieve better productivity rates, and, as a result, industrial production increased by 40% in Britain and by over 100% in Germany. A comparison of capital formation rates {{in the two countries}} helps to account for the different industrial growth rates. During {{the depression}} the British ratio of net national capital formation to net national product fell from 11.5% to 6.0% while Germany's rose from 10.6% to 15.9%. In essence, {{during the course of the}} depression, Britain took the course of static supply adjustment while Germany stimulated effective demand and expanded industrial supply capacity by increasing and adjusting capital formation. For example, Germany dramatically increased investment with regard to <b>social</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>capital,</b> such as in the management of electric power transmission lines, roads, and railroads, while this input stagnated or decreased in Britain and the investment helped to stimulate industrial demand in Germany. The resulting difference in capital formation accounts for the divergent levels of industrial production in the two countries and the different growth rates during and after the depression.|$|E

50|$|The {{strategic}} {{factor is}} that investment level should be above 5% of the national income. This rise in investment rate depends on many sectors of the economy. According to Rostow capital formation depends on the productivity of agriculture {{and the creation of}} <b>social</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>capital.</b> Agriculture plays a very important role in this transition process as the surplus quantity of the produce is to be utilized to support an increasing urban population of workers and also becomes a major exporting sector, earning foreign exchange for continued development and capital formation. Increases in agricultural productivity also lead to expansion of the domestic markets for manufactured goods and processed commodities, which adds to the growth of investment in the industrial sector.|$|E
50|$|The {{large-scale}} programme {{of industrialization}} advocated by this model requires huge investments which {{are beyond the}} means of the private sector. The investment in infrastructure and basic industries (like power, transport and communications) is 'lumpy' and has long gestation periods. The role of the state in this theory is therefore critical for investment in <b>social</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>capital.</b> Even if the private sector had the requisite resources to invest in such a programme, it would not do so since it is driven by profit motives. Many investments are profitable in terms of social marginal net product but not in terms of private marginal net product. Due to this there is no incentive for individual entrepreneurs to invest and take advantage of external economies.|$|E

25|$|The {{first white}} farmers began to immigrate from South Africa and the United Kingdom {{during the late}} nineteenth century, {{less than a hundred}} years after the Ndebele invasions. This {{reflected}} a larger trend of permanent European settlement in the milder, drier regions of Southern Africa as opposed to the tropical and sub-tropical climates further north. In 1889 Cecil Rhodes and the British South Africa Company (BSAC) introduced the earliest white settlers to Zimbabwe as prospectors, seeking concessions from the Ndebele for mineral rights. Collectively known as the Pioneer Column, the settlers established the city of Salisbury, now Harare. Rhodes hoped to discover gold and establish a mining colony, but the original intention had to be modified as neither the costs nor the returns on the <b>overhead</b> <b>capital</b> matched the original projections. Local gold deposits failed to yield the massive returns which the BSAC had promised its investors, and the military costs of the expedition had caused a deficit. An interim solution was the granting of land to the settlers in the hopes that they would develop productive farms and generate enough income to justify the colony's continued administrative costs. The region was demarcated as Southern Rhodesia after 1898.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{endogenous}} theory of time preference is extended to analyze those processes of capital accumulation {{and changes in}} environmental quality that are dynamically optimum {{with respect to the}} intertemporal preference ordering of the representative individual of the society in question. The analysis is carried out within the conceptual framework of the dynamic analysis of environmental quality, as has been developed by a number of economists for specific cases of the fisheries and forestry commons.

40|$|We {{estimate}} the consumption values of urban agglomeration economies and <b>social</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>capital</b> for Japanese metropolitan areas. Following the pioneering work of Tabuchi and Yoshida (2000), our approach exploits {{the fact that}} consumers tolerate higher living costs if they benefit from urban agglomeration economies and/or better <b>social</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>capital.</b> This living cost approach requires an appropriate measure of the representative living cost in a metropolitan area; however, {{it is not easy}} to estimate because housing prices vary widely within a metropolitan area. Tabuchi and Yoshida (2000) choose the average land price for commercial use as a measure of housing costs in a metropolitan area. Because the prices of residential land are typically much lower than those of commercial land, this might have resulted in biased estimates. We estimate bid rent functions for suburban municipalities within metropolitan areas to cope with the aggregation problem. According to our estimation results, the elasticity of the real wage with respect to city size is about - 9. 3 % if we use the land price as the housing price variable and about - 7. 9 % if we use housing rent data. These numbers are comparable to those obtained by Tabuchi and Yoshida (between - 7 % and - 12 % depending on the specification). Another finding is that <b>social</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>capital</b> in a municipality has much larger and more significant effects than city size: the elasticity of the real wage with respect to <b>social</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>capital</b> is about - 24. 4 % in the housing rent estimation and about - 45. 7 % in the land price estimation. ...|$|E

The purpose of this paper is to establish a basic model to analysis certain infrastructure project’s sustainable construction and operation. Design/methodology/approach: System dynamics is an effective stimulation method and tool to deal with such complex, dynamics, nonlinear systems, which could be used in analyzing and evaluating all aspects of infrastructure sustainability internally and externally. In this paper, the system is divided into four subsystems and 12 main impact indicators. Through setting the boundary and other basic hypothesis, this paper designs the basic causal loop diagrams and stock & flow diagrams to describe the relationship between variables and establish a quantifiable structure for the system. Findings: Adopting a sewerage treatment in China as a case to test our model, we could conclude that the model of internal sustainable subsystem is reasonable. However, this model is a basic model, and it need to be specific designed for the certain project due to the diversity of infrastructure types and the unique conditions of each projects.
