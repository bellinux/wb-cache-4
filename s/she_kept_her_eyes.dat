60|$|He hesitated. <b>She</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{turned away}} from him, but her manner denoted impatience.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not notice}} that her voice was strange, nor that <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> averted.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> averted, {{but he saw}} {{the faint}} spot of color burning in her cheeks.|$|E
60|$|The unbreathed sigh {{seemed to}} be added to the weight of oppression on Mary's patient breast; but <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> steady, <b>her</b> brow unruffled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do stop, Nursey, or I shall {{go crazy}} because I don't know the secret!" [...] cried Effie, more than once; and <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> on the clock, for at {{seven in the}} evening the {{surprise}} was to come off.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> still <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{fixed on}} Sydney--still spoke to Sydney.|$|R
60|$|A tremor {{of anxiety}} {{passed over the}} young man's face, on which <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{steadily}} fixed.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her thoughtfully. <b>She</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> averted, but {{she seemed to be}} {{shivering}} a little.|$|E
60|$|They {{stared at}} one another {{for a moment and}} then she looked away. <b>She</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> averted when she spoke.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> upon Henchard also. One day he {{answered}} her inquiry for his health {{by saying that}} he could not endure Abel Whittle's pitying eyes upon him while they worked together in the yard. [...] "He is such a fool," [...] said Henchard, [...] "that he can never get out of his mind the time when I was master there." ...|$|R
60|$|Surprises, in Josie's line of {{work were}} not uncommon, and this {{was no time to}} {{consider}} whys and wherefores. The one thing she was sure of was that the bomb was in the black satchel and the black satchel in Kauffman's hand. No matter where the other conspirators might be or how they were implicated in tonight's plot, as long as <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> on the bomb, {{she would be able to}} control the situation.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> had <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on {{him while}} he spoke, and this was what, visibly, {{determined}} a repetition for her. [...] "Are you trying to frighten me?" ...|$|R
60|$|She never {{opened her}} mouth. I stared--she stared also: at any rate, <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{on me in}} a cool, {{regardless}} manner, exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I will not!" [...] said Gwendolen, {{taking up}} her gauntlets {{and putting them}} on, while <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on him with {{gathering}} fun in them.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I was saying: It was a cinch to {{see that}} Sandy's girl thought you was ace high, alrightee. <b>She</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> glommed onto you all the time." ...|$|E
60|$|She saw him no more till evening; then {{he looked}} excited, played stormily, and would sing in {{defiance}} of danger. The trouble in Amy's face seemed reflected in Helen's, though not a word had passed between them. <b>She</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> on Casimer, with an intentness that worried Amy, and {{even when he was}} at the instrument Helen stood near him, as if fascinated, watching the slender hands chase one another up and down the keys with untiring strength and skill.|$|R
60|$|She did {{not answer}} him at once. <b>She</b> still <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> resolutely turned away from his. When at last she spoke, her voice was {{scarcely}} raised above a whisper.|$|R
6000|$|It {{seemed to}} them as if <b>she</b> had <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed upon that {{particular}} portion of the paper fully fifteen minutes before a look of relief came over her face, and she asked, suddenly: ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Easterfield {{knew exactly}} where the book was, but she {{preferred}} to allow Olive to occupy herself in looking for it, while <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on the hall.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on her companion's face, {{but his own}} now and {{afterwards}} seemed to wander far. [...] "What do I care for his reasons so long as they're not mine?" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{though she}} were {{listening}} {{to the sound of}} his steps in the dark instead of having him there visibly before her, <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> upon him with a dreamy unrecognition.|$|E
60|$|Certain {{it is that}} {{throughout}} the spectacle <b>she</b> had <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> closed, and when death-cries filled the air with their terrible echo, she had once or twice put her small hands to her ears.|$|R
60|$|Along that {{strip of}} shadow she ran, crouching; now {{stumbling}} over a boulder, now crushing {{her bare feet}} between the sharp pebbles, as, heedless where <b>she</b> stepped, <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> fixed on <b>her</b> mother. As if fascinated, she could see nothing else in heaven or earth but that dark figure, hurrying along with a dogged determination, and then stopping a moment to look round, as if in fear of a pursuer. And then Grace {{lay down on the}} cold stones, and pressed herself into the very earth; and the moment her mother turned to go forward, sprang up and followed.|$|R
6000|$|She had not moved; {{she had let}} me take my {{hand from}} her own with as little sign as on her first feeling its touch. <b>She</b> only <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on me. [...] "What made {{you have such a}} fancy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-by," [...] said Ludlow, and {{he lifted}} his hat and stood bowing {{her out of the}} Fine Arts Department, while <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on him to the last with admiration and approval.|$|E
6000|$|Catherine {{for some}} time never moved; <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on the coals. At last she raised her head {{and looked at her}} aunt. [...] "Why do you push me so?" [...] she asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ask the mistress, there," [...] said Richard, {{as he saw}} his Susan's {{white face}} and {{trembling}} fingers, though <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on her work {{to prevent them from}} betraying their tears and their wistfulness.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite said nothing; {{the whole}} thing was too horrible for words, but <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> large <b>eyes</b> fixed upon <b>her</b> husband's face... waiting for that look, that sign from him which would have eased the agonizing anxiety in her heart, and which never came.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> had <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{fixed on}} that door until they burned and ached with well-nigh {{intolerable}} pain; yet {{she felt that}} she could not look elsewhere, lest she missed the golden moment when the bolts would be drawn, and that dull, grey door would swing slowly on its rusty hinges.|$|R
6000|$|While {{apparently}} {{absorbed in}} her own affairs, Jo watched Beth, and after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one which seemed to explain the change in her. A slight incident gave Jo the clue to the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving heart did the rest. She was affecting to write busily one Saturday afternoon, when she and Beth were alone together. Yet as <b>she</b> scribbled, <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> on <b>her</b> sister, who seemed unusually quiet. Sitting at the window, Beth's work often dropped into her lap, and she leaned her head upon her hand, in a dejected attitude, while <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> rested on the dull, autumnal landscape. Suddenly some one passed below, whistling like an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out, [...] "All serene! Coming in tonight." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Peters took a surreptitiously keen {{look at his}} wife. Her formless bulk overflowed the chair. <b>She</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed out {{the window}} in a strange kind of trance. Her eyes showed {{that she had been}} {{recently}} weeping.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{on him and}} the {{darkness}} seemed to clear. [...] "No!" [...] she at last replied, and, having gone to touch an electric bell, was with him again. [...] "But I think I'm rather sorry for you." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{had begun}} a silent grace, {{and her husband}} had thrown his hat in her face. <b>She</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> upon her plate, and her lips moved as if in prayer, though a flush of red {{streamed}} up her neck and covered her cheek.|$|E
6000|$|All {{the time}} <b>she</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> dark, inchoate <b>eyes</b> full upon him. He {{remained}} silent, thinking. Then, switching off and becoming cold, he asked, {{in a voice}} full of considerate kindness: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you {{anything}} to say to me, before I tell Carmina that you are here?" [...] Mrs. Gallilee put that question quietly, so far as her voice was concerned. But <b>she</b> still <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on <b>her</b> book. Ovid knew that she was offering him his first and last chance of speaking plainly, before he went away. In Carmina's interests he spoke.|$|R
60|$|Waiting at the gateway, she {{had seen}} Ralph and Cicely walk up the hill, and watched them {{standing}} together, ever and ever so long, looking at the sky, and <b>she</b> had <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> on them as they came down the hill, stopped to pick flowers which he gave to her, and until they had disappeared among the trees of the orchard.|$|R
