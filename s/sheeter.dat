40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence of parasitic infection via vegetables consumed in Isfahan in 2011. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, 120 samples of vegetables were collected from 12 sites in the vegetable supply of Isfahan. Then samples were washed carefully with the detergent, the solution condensed with the <b>Sheeters</b> flotation method and ether Ritchie method in case of detecting parasites with microscope. Statistical analysis was done with Excel and SPSS software. Results: Among the samples, 48. 4 % were infected with pathogenic and nonpathogenic parasite eggs and larvae, and 51. 6 % of samples were not infected by parasite. Among the contaminated samples, 48. 1 % were nonpathogenic, and Giardia with a frequency of 0. 4 % was the only pathogenic parasite that observed. Conclusion: The study showed that the percentage of parasites in raw vegetables was close to zero. However, the previous study in Isfahan city reported 13 % contamination. The reduction in intestinal worm infections is probably the result of development of water and wastewater networks, improvement in public health and public knowledge about parasitic infections and different ways of its prevention...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the implementation of Lean Manufacturing in that context, and to determine the impact it had on the printing company’s profit margin. A process-mapping of the printing organization was performed; this process-mapping is referred to as ‘Value Stream Mapping’, which is a Lean Manufacturing technique.

40|$|Nano-tin oxide was {{deposited}} {{on the surface}} of wollastonite using the mixed solution including stannic chloride pentahydrate precursor and wollastonite by a hydrolysis precipitation process. The antistatic properties of the wollastonite materials under different calcined conditions and composite materials (nano-SnO 2 /wollastonite, SW) were measured by rubber <b>sheeter</b> and four-point probe (FPP) sheet resistance measurement. Effects of hydrolysis temperature and time, calcination temperature and time, pH value and nano-SnO 2 coating amount on the resistivity of SW powders were studied, and the optimum experimental conditions were obtained. The microstructure and surface properties of wollastonite, precipitate and SW were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), specific surface area analyzer (BET), thermogravimetry (TG), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier translation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) respectively. The results showed that the nano-SnO 2 /wollastonite composite materials under optimum preparation conditions showed better antistatic properties, the resistivity of which was reduced from 1. 068 × 104 Ω cm to 2. 533 × 103 Ω cm. From TG and XRD analysis, the possible mechanism for coating of SnO 2 nanoparticles {{on the surface of}} wollastonite was proposed. The infrared spectrum indicated that there were a large number of the hydroxyl groups on the surface of wollastonite. This is beneficial to the heterogeneous nucleation reaction.

40|$|Bread dough {{sheeting}} is {{an important}} operation in the bread making industry. The process involves the passing of a mass of dough between two, or more, rotating rollers. The function of sheeting can be: i) to shape the dough, ii) to laminate layers of product together or iii) to develop the gluten network, which gives dough many of its properties. The model developed, in this thesis, describes the dough sheeting process using a continuum mechanics approach, solved using a perturbation technique. The bread dough rheology is described using the Criminale-Ericksen-Filbey (CEF) viscoelastic constitutive equation. It was thought that this approach may model the process better than the viscous models used elsewhere. The perturbation technique, used in solution, meant that the model remained computationally swift. The CEF equation was used as it is reasonably simple mathematically and measuring the required dough properties was quite straightforward, although, as was discovered, reproducibly measuring the properties of bread dough is never easy, not least because of the history dependent nature of bread dough. Some important assumptions made, in this model, {{on the basis of}} literature and preliminary experiments, were that: the process is two-dimensional; the process is at steady state; the process is unaffected by inertia, temperature or gravity; some parts of the process (conveyor belt speeds, for example) are unimportant; and that the dough is incompressible. It was found that such a model can be used to predict the exit height of the dough, the forces and torques experienced by the rollers, and velocity and pressure profiles in the dough. The predictions were qualitatively consistent with validation data gathered on a pilot plant <b>sheeter,</b> but there were some large quantitative inaccuracies, particularly with the exit height prediction (as there is with viscous models). The inaccuracies suggest that such an approach to modelling bread dough sheeting misses some important facet of the process, possibly the compressibility of the dough. That is, a viscoelastic description of the process material will not, alone, lead to a complete model of the dough sheeting process...|$|E

Two objective methods to determine texture of corn masa using the TA. XT 2 texture analyzer were developed and compared with subjective evaluations of the texture and machinability of corn masas from nixtarnalized corn flours used for tortillas and tacos. Several methods to form masa in an objective repeatable way were developed during this study. The TPA analysis measurements included hardness, adhesiveness, cohesiveness, springiness, gumminess, and chewiness. The TPA hardness values were the most highly correlated with subjective texture values and had the lowest coefficient of variation. The TPA adhesiveness values were correlated with subjective masa texture measurements; however, the coefficient of variation was high (50 %) which limited its acceptability for measuring masa stickiness. None of the other four TPA measurements were practical measures of masa texture. The adhesiveness force was significantly correlated with subjective evaluations of masa texture but it had a relatively high coefficient of variation (21 %) which limited its effectiveness. Measurements from the adhesiveness test {{did not appear to be}} as good as the hardness values obtained from the TPA technique. The TA. XT 2 texture analyzer was taken to a commercial tortilleria where the TPA and adhesiveness tests were used to determine-nine differences among commercial masas produced in the plant and the changes that occurred. Both methods could be used in the commercial tortilleria to obtain repeatable data. The TPA hardness and adhesiveness values increased and decreased, respectively, as masa was stored up to 24 hrs. No difference among fresh masas for different products were observed but fresh masa mixed with nixtamalized corn flours had significantly higher hardness values which was also noted by subjective observations. TPA hardness successfully detected differences in masas before and after pumping from the grinder to the <b>sheeter.</b> The hardness method is the most useful and reproducible measurement. None of the methods evaluated were effective indicators of masa stickiness although the adhesiveness test might have good potential provided the probe used in this test is redesigned using metal typically used in masa sheeting and pressing...|$|E
