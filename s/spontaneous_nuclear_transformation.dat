Therefore, there have been increased demands for useful species and varieties of these macroalgae. However, genetic transformation in macroalgae has not yet been established. We have developed a dominant selection marker for stable <b>nuclear</b> <b>transformation</b> in the red macroalga Pyropia yezoensis. We engineered the coding region of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene aph 7 aEuro(3) from Streptomyces hygroscopicus to adapt codon usage of the nuclear genes of P. yezoensis.

This method is not only simple, inexpensive, and non-toxic to cells but also provides efficient transformation (5. 03 × 10 (2) transformants/µg DNA), second only to electroporation which needs advanced instrumentation. We present optimized parameters for efficient transformation including pre-treatment, friction force, concentration of foreign DNA/aminoclay, and plasticity of agar plates.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a novel {{principle}} is proposed {{to increase the}} CO 2 concentration {{in the vicinity of}} Rubisco thereby suppressing photorespiration in C 3 plants. The pathway is derived from E. coli and converts the glycolate formed during photorespiration into glycerate. Three enzymatic activities are required: Glycolate dehydrogenase (GDH), Glyoxylate carboligase (GCL), and Tratronic semialdehyde reductase (TSR). In order to establish the pathway in the chloroplast of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), all necessary genes were cloned in both prokaryotic and plant expression vectors in N-terminal translational fusion to a His-tag. The genes were first expressed in bacteria and the enzymatic activity of the constructs was shown. Transgenic tobacco plants were created containing all genes necessary for the proposed pathway by plastdial as well as <b>nuclear</b> <b>transformation.</b> Plastidial transformation was done by constructing a single polycistronic operon with five open reading frames. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>transformation</b> was performed by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of single or double constructs. Plastid transformants were checked by southern blot analysis. Many transgenic plants with a variable size of shortened transgenic sequences were detected. Moreover, many of the transgenic plants also displayed drastic chlorosis and stunted growth. However, few plants showed integration of the complete operon and the next generation of those plants is currently analysed. Initially, transgenic plants containing TSR and GCL were created by <b>nuclear</b> <b>transformation</b> {{due to the lack of}} a suitable glycolate oxidising enzyme. Variable amounts of foreign proteins were detected in Western blots. Enzymatic assays showed that the proteins are active in planta. However transgenic plants containing GCL protein again showed a chlorotic phenotype. A putative open reading frame was identified in the Arabidopsis genome sequence with homology to glycolate-oxidizing enzymes. The open reading frame was cloned and expressed in bacteria. Enzymatic assays and complementation tests showed that the protein is indeed a glycolate dehydrogenase. The gene is preferentially expressed in illuminated leaves and the enzyme is located inside the mitochondria. This protein forms an optimised starting point for the completion of the proposed pathway...|$|R

Attractive features of this technology include specific integration of transgenes—either individually or as operons—into the plastid genome through homologous recombination, the potential for high-level protein expression, and transgene containment because of the maternal inheritance of plastids. Several issues associated with <b>nuclear</b> <b>transformation</b> such as gene silencing, variable gene expression due to the Mendelian laws of inheritance, and epigenetic regulation have not been observed in the plastid genome.

By using either supercoiled or linear plasmid DNA, transformants were recovered consistently at a low efficiency, {{on the order of}} 15 transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA. In all cases the transforming DNA was integrated into the nuclear genome, usually in multiple copies. Most of the introduced copies were genetically linked to each other, and they were unlinked to the original nit 1 locus.
