40|$|Intuitive {{expertise}} {{in the application of}} advanced interdisciplinary facilitation is the <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> personal <b>reflection</b> on the graduate supervisory style of Professor David Squires in computers in education. This single-case reflective study examines the characteristics of effective supervision observed during masters and doctoral supervision at King's College in the years 1990 - 9. Interdisciplinarity in ICT graduate studies particularly requires a fluency of supervisory {{expertise in}} enabling supervisees to combine multiple complex perspectives from a number of fields of knowledge. Intuitive combinatory aspects of supervision are highlighted in <b>this</b> <b>reflection</b> on the role carried out by an academic expert in facilitating student success. This is examined from a perspective incorporating affective as well as intellectual elements, informed by characteristics identified in professional sports and performing arts coaching/mentoring. Key characteristics comprising a model of intuitive expertise in ICT graduate supervision were outlined. The resultant portrait aims to complement existing literature on graduate supervision, with reference to the field of ICTI computers in education relating to student hypermedia composition...|$|R

Interviews were conducted with ten family caregivers and a focus group {{with a team of}} professional home care of a hospital oncology. Some relatives of those patients were hospitalized and others at home in that institution. From the focus group were defined four categories for analysis, and also supported by the analysis of the interviews, they are: concepts of caregiver, caregiver training, job challenges and beliefs and attitudes towards death. The analyzes allowed us to affirm that caregivers - both professional and family members - recognize the experience as a process that is over time and the challenges of care surrounding the death are the <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> ongoing <b>reflection.</b> <b>This</b> study contributes to the debate on palliative care, growing interdisciplinary object approaching work and family...|$|R
40|$|We are {{witnessing}} a new situation: thanks to new empiric methods contemporary science enter the sphere that formerly {{used to be}} the <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> philosophical <b>reflection.</b> <b>This</b> situation refers also to ethical questions. Research, particularly that relating to neurobiological and cognitive foundations suggest significant changes in our perception of a human being while many researchers and theorists predict revolutionary changes to follow. This means that the old disputes become current anew, although in a different context: on one hand – in the light of unquestionable successes of neurobiology and other sciences, there is an increasing number of supporters of the naturalization concept whereas on the other hand – there are growing concerns about the “naturalized” view on the human and the world. In my paper, I would like to address two major questions. The first one refers to the results of contemporary research carried out within the framework of broadly construed neuroscience which may affect the functioning of a human in the sphere of ethics. The other question is whether one really should be concerned about the naturalization of ethics (whereby it greatly depends on how the “naturalization” is understood). Either way, there is much evidence in support of the view that Dostoyevsky was wrong stating that if God does not exist (or, specifically: the immortal soul, volitional “I”, etc), everything is permitted. Due to their importance, these questions will require broader, possibly interdisciplinary discussion and refraining from simplified conclusions that are often a result of ignorance...|$|R
40|$|The <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>reflection</b> {{within the}} area of {{pedagogy}} and the philosophy of physical culture is bodily asceticism: both secular and religious. The asceticism of the gymnasion leads to the refinement of bodily powers {{so as to be}} able to fulfil social tasks. Penitential asceticism is a means of symbolic reparation for sins committed. It is known that the first kind of asceticism brings the body alive; the second "mortifies" it. The models of the religious asceticism of monks are discussed, both of those who integrate into the social life of mainstream society (internal asceticism) and that of those monks who renounce the human condition forever (external asceticism A particular case of anti-socialisation is the sadhu – a Hindu ascetic, who achieves anonymous namelessness. The patterns of asceticism of integrated (internal asceticism) monks permeate secular life, while the asceticism of the gymnasion is not shared by monks and priests. Although both patterns of asceticism aim at natural corporeality, their vectors of cause are contra-rotating. Monastic rule does not presuppose the gymnasion formation of a saint, which means that the religious ethos contradicts the law of nature. The law of asceticism of the bodily person is formulated based on the premise of natural law. This indicates the possibility of combining health education with the catechesis of penitential asceticism {{within the framework of the}} logically consistent pedagogy of an ascetic lifestyle...|$|E

40|$|Após alguns meses de con-vivência com pessoas cegas, alguns questionamentos sobre as relações dessas pessoas com o mundo começaram a surgir. Estas inquietações acabaram transformando-se em um problema que assumi como desafio para desvendar: Como o cego percebe o corpo e o mundo na inter-relação com o mundo dos videntes? Refletir o irrefletido, que permanece como componente {{fundamental}} do comportamento e das condutas do cego, numa atitude de compreender e desvelar a organização e a desorganização da existência humana, enfatizando o corpo do cego na relação consigo próprio, com o outro e com o mundo é o objeto e o tema das minhas reflexões. Esse estudo é de caráter bibliográfico em que, além das análises, reflexões e discussões com diversos autores da literatura específica de cada tema, há o diálogo constante com pessoas que apresentam deficiência visual. Desse modo o trabalho se apresenta da seguinte forma: Momento I - a partir da minha história de vida coloco-me de frente e à frente do fenômeno o qual busco compreender; Momento II  o corpo cego é visível! O corpo cego é vidente! São incitações para aprender e apreender as questões relativas à corporeidade do cego com base em alguns autores da fenomenologia, ressaltando sua essência, existência e presentidade na relação com o mundo; Momento III  conhecer a Teoria da Complexidade e acreditar que sou um serno- mundo aliciado por um conjunto de coisas, as quais revelam a minha existência e são compreensíveis e incompreensíveis ao mesmo tempo, despertam a necessidade de compreender a relação existente entre o corpo cego e o corpo vidente, na perspectiva da Teoria da Complexidade; Momento IV  a educação e a motricidade são os temas centrais desse momento, por serem áreas em que o corpo sempre estará presente na sua facticidade e na sua relação com o mundo, vivendo sua existencialidade e suas descobertas; Último Momento  os sentidos do ver e viver fazem trasncender em mim apreensões e sensações do ver e não ver com os olhos, mas ver e viver com o corpo, inseminando no meu ser e no meu viver o sabor e o prazer de continuar minha trajetória de vida percebendo os seres humanos de modo diferente de como eu os percebia antes. After {{some months}} of con-experience with blind people, some questionings on {{the relations of}} these people with the world had started to appear.

To reflect which doesnt reflects, that he remains as component basic of the behavior and the behaviors of the blind person, in an attitude to understand and to revail on the organization and the disorganization of the existence human being, emphasizing the body of the blind person in the relation I obtain proper, with the other and the world it is the object and the <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> my <b>reflections.</b> <b>This</b> study he is of bibliographical character where beyond the analyses, reflections and quarrels with diverse authors of the specific literature <b>of</b> each <b>subject,</b> have the constant dialogue with people who present visual deficiency. In this way the work presents of the following form: Moment I - from the my history of life I place myself in front of and faced to phenomenon which I search to understand; Moment II - the blind body is visible! The blind body is vidente! They are incitations on the basis of to learn and to apprehend the relative questions to the corporeidade of the blind person some authors of the fenomenologia, standing out its essence, existence and presentidade in the relation with the world; Moment III - to know the Theory of the Complexity and to believe that I am a be-no-world bridden for a set of things, which they disclose mine, existence and is understandable and incompressible at the same time, awakes the necessity to understand the existing relation between the blind body and the body vidente, in the perspective of the Theory of the Complexity; Moment IV - the education and the motricidade are the <b>subjects</b> central offices <b>of</b> <b>this</b> moment, for being areas where the body always will be present in its facticidade and its relation with the world, living its existencialidade and its discoveries; Last Moment - the directions of seeing and living make to trasncender in me apprehensions and sensations of seeing and not to see with the eyes, but to see and to live with the body, inseminating in my being and my life the flavor and the pleasure to continue my trajectory of life perceiving the human beings in different way of as I perceived them before...|$|R

40|$|The premise <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>reflection</b> {{flows from}} the {{tradition}} of the Roman Catholic Church. The Catholic Church's tradition has held for 2000 years that both the vocation to life-long marriage and the vocation to life-long celibacy are good in themselves. They also are both wonderful ways to live out one's life in response to an invitation from God. Married love and celibate love have distinct focuses. In my first reflection on "The Foundation of Life-Long Marital Love," I use John Paul II's first book, Love and Responsibility, and its analysis of the metaphysical, psychological, and ethical nature of love within a marriage relationship. The second reflection is on "The Foundation of Life-Long Celibate Love. " <b>This</b> <b>reflection</b> explores the history of celibacy, and the fundamental biblical call to celibacy "for the Kingdom" and "for the Lord.
