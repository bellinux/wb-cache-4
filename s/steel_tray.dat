2500|$|Tamil Nadu {{is noted}} for its deep belief that serving food to others is a service to humanity, as is common in many regions of India. The region has a rich cuisine {{involving}} both traditional non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes. Tamil food is characterised by its use of rice, legumes, and lentils, along with distinct aromas and flavours achieved by the blending of spices such as curry leaves, tamarind, coriander, ginger, garlic, chili pepper, cinnamon, clove, cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, coconut and rose water. The traditional way of eating a meal involves being seated on the floor, having the food served on a plantain leaf, and using the right hand to eat. After the meal the plantain leaf is discarded but becomes food for free-ranging cattle and goats. A meal (called Saapadu) consists of rice with other typical Tamil dishes on a plantain leaf. A typical Tamilian would eat in plantain leaf as it gives different flavour and taste to the food. But {{it can also be}} served on a stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tray</b> – plate with a selection of different dishes in small bowls. Tamil food is characterized by tiffins, which is a light food taken for breakfast or dinner, and meals which are usually taken during lunch. The word [...] "curry" [...] is derived from the Tamil kari, meaning something similar to [...] "sauce". The southern regions such as Tirunelveli, Madurai, Paramakudi, Karaikudi, and Chettinad are noted for their spicy non-vegetarian dishes. Dosa, idli, pongal and Biryani are some of the popular dishes and are eaten with chutney and sambar. Fish and other seafoods are also very popular, because the state is located on the coast. Chicken and goat meat is the predominantly consumed meats in Tamil Nadu. Many Tamilians are vegetarian, however, and the typical meal is heavily dependent on rice, vegetables and lentil preparations such as rasam and sambar. Tamil food tends to be spicy compared to other parts of India so there is a tradition of finishing the meal with Yogurt is considered a soothing end to the meal.|$|E

Until 1972, when the rink was covered by a roof resting on a laminated <b>steel</b> <b>tray</b> frame, the ice was directly subjected to natural weather. In 1977 the galleries were built between the central platform and the southeast corner. 5 years later, the current building was built, including dressing rooms and a bar upstairs. In 1985, the lighting was rebuilt and in 1987, work was undertaken to repair the slab and refrigeration.|$|E

5000|$|Dishes {{served in}} a Thali vary from region to region in South Asia and are usually served in small bowls, called katori. These 'katoris' are placed along {{the borders of the}} round tray - the actual thali; even a <b>steel</b> <b>tray</b> with {{multiple}} compartments is used. Typical dishes include rice, dal, vegetables, roti, papad, curd (yoghurt), small amounts of chutney or pickle, and a sweet dish to top it off. Rice or Roti is the usual main dish which occupies the central portion of the Thali, while the side dishes like vegetable curries and other aforementioned delicacies are lined circularly along the round Thali. Depending on the restaurant or the region, the thali consists of delicacies native to that region. In general, a thali begins with different types of breads such as puris or chapatis (rotis) and different vegetarian specialities (curries). However, in South India, rice is the only staple served with thalis. Thalis are sometimes referred to by the regional characteristic of the dishes they contain. For example, one may encounter Nepalese thali, Rajasthani thali, Gujarati thali and Maharashtrian thali. In many parts of India and Nepal, the bread and the rice portions are not served together in the thali. Typically, the bread is offered first with rice being served afterwards, often in a separate bowl or dish.|$|E

The tokamak edge plasma, when operated in contact with the lithium-filled tray, shows evidence of reduced impurities and recycling. The reduction in re cycling and impurities is largest when the lithium is liquefied by heating to 250 degrees Celsius. Discharges which are limited by the liquid lithium tray show evidence of performance enhancement. Radiated power is reduced and there is spectroscopic evidence for increases in the core electron temperature. Furthermore, the use of a liquid lithium limiter reduces the need for conditioning discharges prior to high current operation.

40|$|This paper reports {{data on the}} {{structure}} and performances of an automated growth chamber prototype for plantlet vegetable production (Box Nursery), developed {{in relation to the}} research activity carried on in the Italian basis “Baia Terra Nova”, in Antarctica. The prototype was built to produce young plants for supporting the Plant-based Unit for Life Support (PULSA) installed at Terra Nova Bay, in the frame of an ongoing research activity of the PNRA (Italian Program Research in Antarctica). The Box Nursery is composed by: a growth chamber (89 x 69 cm, height 203 cm); a second body (satellite cube, 76 x 70 cm, height 91 cm) containing the control unit system and the irrigation tanks. Three germination module units were installed in the growth chamber, each composed by a <b>steel</b> <b>tray</b> equipped with a subirrigation system and a lighting panel. Cooling, heating and de-humidification systems were included in the growth chamber for maintaining optimal growth condition for plantlets. However, a system of ventilation was installed for preventing CO 2 and ethylene accumulation as well as oxygen depletion in the growth chamber. A specific software (Box Nursery management Software) was developed to allow the control of all systems and to record internal climatic condition. The prototype of Box Nursery was tested for 1 year with different vegetable plants (such as lettuce, tomato, radish, rocket etc.).

Forty cups were placed in a stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tray</b> (32 [*]×[*] 25 [*]×[*] 5.3  cm) with drainage holes. Each germinated seed was sown {{at the center of a}} cup in a randomized complete block design, and covered with a 1 -cm layer of soil without fertilizer (Shibanome-tsuchi). The tray was placed in a large plastic container (44.5 [*]×[*] 32.5 × 7  cm). Until the second leaf stage, the water level was maintained at 2  cm above the soil surface from a supply beneath the tray. From the second leaf stage to the time of rooting assessment, the water level was maintained at the level of the soil surface. The plants were grown in a greenhouse at 20 – 30 °C under natural day length. At the third leaf stage, the top layer of soil covering the cups was removed carefully without cutting primary roots that had grown over the edges of cups, and the cups were removed from the tray. The primary roots that had elongated past the edge of the cup were counted as soil-surface roots (Figure  1 C and D). The plants were then removed from the cups, and the soil attached to the roots was washed away. The total number of roots was counted for each plant. The soil-surface root ratio for each plant was defined as the number of soil-surface roots divided by the total number of primary roots, and was expressed as a percentage.|$|E

After that, 5  cm segments were cut at the mid-jejunum and mid-ileum, respectively. The 5  cm intestinal segments were flushed gently with ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and then placed in 10  % fresh, chilled formalin solution for histological measurements. Approximately 20  cm of jejunal and ileal segments were opened longitudinally and mucosa were scratched carefully using a sterile glass microscope slide, respectively. Samples were collected into a 1.5  mL sterile tube and immediately frozen at − 80  °C until further analysis.

40|$|The {{deposition}} of radionuclides {{on the ground}} is an essential process to understand atmospheric transportation, sedimentation and geological process, being the major removal pathway for airborne particulates. To predict the long-term radiological consequences of an accidental {{deposition of}} the radionuclides to the ground, it is a prerequisite to know the environmental long-term behaviour of these radionuclides and a relatively large number of values are required for statistically meaningful conclusions. Nuclides of the natural decay chains, especially for 238 U decay chain, are widely applied into atmospheric research, oceanography and marine geology. Atmospheric depositional fluxes of 7 Be, 210 Pb and 40 K were simultaneously measured in monthly interval for eleven years (from January 2005 to December 2015 at Málaga (4 º 28 ´ 8 W; 36 º 43 ´ 40 N). Samples were collected monthly in an area of 1 m 2 using a collector that is a slightly tilted stainless <b>steel</b> <b>tray</b> and filling 25 or 50 L polyethylene vessels with bulk deposition. The radionuclides present in all samples are 7 Be, 210 Pb and 40 K appears approximately in 50 % of the samples. The temporal variations of radionuclides in bulk deposition exhibit similar seasonal behaviour with low values in winter-autumn months and maximum values in spring-summer months. The time variations of the different radionuclides have been discussed in relation to various meteorological factors and the mean values have been compared to those published in recent literature for other sites located at different latitudes. Bulk depositional fluxes of 7 Be, 210 Pb and 40 K have been evaluated for period of measurements. Bulk depositional fluxes of 7 Be, 210 Pb and 40 K varied between 3 and 1779 Bq m- 2 month- 1 (annual mean = 1247 Bq m- 2 year- 1), and 1 to 102 Bq m- 2 year- 1 (annual mean = 140 Bq m- 2 year- 1) and 0, 5 to 81 Bq m- 2 year- 1 (annual mean = 65 Bq m- 2 year- 1).

30|$|Six kilogrammes of lean steak was {{obtained}} from the silverside of a 36 -month-old Borana bull, slaughtered in a local abattoir in Nairobi. The steak was divided into three chunks of approximately 2 kg each. The three chunks were each cut into approximately 10 -, 15 - and 20 -mm cubical chunks, then laid on stainless <b>steel</b> perforated <b>trays</b> which were placed in a pre-heated thermostatically controlled cabinet dryer (Innotech, model HT 4, Ingenieursgesellschaft mbH, Germany). The three batches were then pre-dried at 40 °C for 0, 60 and 120 min. The pre-drying environment was designed to simulate the prevailing environmental atmosphere conditions in the Kenyan pastoral regions during the dry season. On average, temperatures in the dry season reach between 30 °C and 35 °C and a simple solar drier could be used to concentrate this temperature to a minimum of 40 °C.|$|R
40|$|Direct {{measurement}} of surface runoff is {{often associated with}} errors and inaccuracies which results to unreliable hydrological data. An automatic Runoff-meter using tipping buckets arrangement calibrated to tip 0. 14 liter of runoff water per tip with an accuracy of ± 0. 001 litre was used to measure surface runoff from a <b>steel</b> bounded soil <b>tray</b> of dimension (1200 mm X 900 mm X 260 mm) filled with sand loamy to the depth of 130 mm and inclined at angle (0 0, 5 0, 12 0 and 15 0) horizontal to the instrument. The effect of varying angles of inclination on runoff intensity, sediment loss rate and sediment loss is significant at 5...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Feed Strip" [...] (also {{referred}} to as an [...] "ammo strip" [...] or [...] "feed tray") was initially designed in 1896 by Benjamin Hotchkiss, based on initial designs by Captain Baron Adolf Odkolek von Ujezda of Vienna, Austria. A feed strip is a simple rigid metal (usually <b>steel</b> or brass) <b>tray</b> with typically 24 to 30 cartridges crimped together into a row. The feed strip is loaded {{into the side of}} the gun and as the cartridges are stripped off and fired from the weapon, the tray gradually moves to the other side until it falls out when it is empty, whereupon a new one is inserted. In this regard, it is similar to an En-bloc clip. The [...] "feed strip" [...] loading system was pioneered by the Hotchkiss machine gun designs, most notably the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun. The Hotchkiss guns were used by major militaries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and the French throughout the duration of the first world war and slightly afterwards. However, the feed strip mechanisms lived on through other militaries, most notably the Japanese-designed Type 3 and Type 92 machine guns, which were used up until the end of the second world war.|$|R
