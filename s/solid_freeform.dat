40|$|A view of {{manufacturing}} processes {{is presented in}} which five distinct categories are defined as casting, deformation, machining, joining, and <b>solid</b> <b>freeforming.</b> <b>Solid</b> <b>freeforming</b> is essentially biomimetic and shares problems of morphogenesis with natural processes. Our team in University of London has been exploring three mechanisms of <b>solid</b> <b>freeforming.</b> In dry powder deposition and direct ink-jet printing, the emphasis has turned {{to the problem of}} delivering a complex shape in which the three dimensional spatial arrangement of composition is delivered from the design file. In extrusion freeforming, the aim is to control microstructure at hierarchical levels also from the design file. The quest for 3 -D functional gradients is satisfied by acoustic and ultrasonic dispensing and mixing of powders so that each layer can be patterned. These methods could be extended to deliver the complex patterns demanded by left-handed microwave metamaterials. Dry powder deposition and direct ink-jet printing are turning towards combinatorial methods in which multiple sample libraries are used to accelerate discovery. In turn, this paves the way for [`]autonomous research machines' which steer their own search refinements in response to our requests for new materials.

40|$|The need {{to meter}} and {{dispense}} dry powders or mixtures of powders {{occurs in a}} wide range of processes and industries. These include the preparation of pharmaceutical products, the mixing of pigments for paints, inks and glazes, the incorporation of processing additives and pigments into polymer processing lines such as extrusion and in <b>solid</b> <b>freeforming</b> processes. This short review identifies the common features of powder handling in these widely different areas and seeks to distinguish and classify the various principles. Examples are given of designs that span a range of industries. This review is stimulated by current developments in the selective laser sintering of powder assemblies; a <b>solid</b> <b>freeforming</b> pathway for polymer, ceramic and metal prototyping and manufacturing. The goal is to find metering and dispensing systems that are effective in providing the spatial arrangement of composition.

40|$|Ultrasonic microfeeding of powders {{is a new}} and {{promising}} method for use in <b>solid</b> <b>freeforming</b> and pharmaceutical dosing. In this work, computer-controlled microfeeding systems using ultrasonic vibration of a capillary were built. A wide range of controlled, stable rates of flow and switching control were achieved in the acoustic vibration system and uniform powder doses were obtained in the ultrasonic system. Experimental results show that nozzle diameter, transmission fluid depth, waveform, voltage amplitude, frequency and oscillation duration all influence the dose mass. Among these factors, nozzle diameter, voltage amplitude and oscillation duration can be best used to control the dose mass. An artificial neural network (ANN) technique was applied to predict the dose mass. Based on these research results, four types of microfeeding were proposed. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonic microfeeding {{can be used}} in <b>solid</b> <b>freeforming</b> and {{pharmaceutical}} dosing. In this work, dose uniformity was studied because {{it is one of the}} important factors in evaluation of microfeeding. The experiments were carried out in a computer-controlled microfeeding system. The powders used were H 13 tool steel, tungsten carbide (WC) and glass beads. The experimental results show that the minimum dose mass for these powders in a 0. 2 mm diameter nozzle is close to 0. 1 mg, 14 ?g and 16 ?g respectively. The probability distributions of relative mean dose mass deviation can be divided into four categories: single symmetrical peak, single positive skewed peak, single negative skewed peak or double peaks. Because the signal amplitude voltage and oscillation period are the two important factors influencing dose mass, the effects of these two factors on standard deviation, relative standard deviation and probability distribution were studied and discussed. <br/...|$|R
50|$|With the {{emergence}} of <b>solid</b> <b>freeform</b> fabrication the possibility to produce custom-designed biomedical implants (e.g. hip joints) has been realized. While it is not applied currently on a larger scale, freeform fabrication methods offers the ability to recycle waste powder (from the manufacturing process) and makes for selectivity tailoring desirable properties and thus {{the performance of the}} implant. Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and Selective Laser Melting (SLM) are two methods applicable for freeform fabrication of Ti-alloys. Manufacturing parameters greatly influence the micro-structure of the product, where e.g. a fast cooling rate in combination with low degree of melting in SLM leads to the predominant formation of martensitic alpha-prime-phase, giving a very hard product.|$|E
50|$|The {{technologies}} {{referred to}} as <b>Solid</b> <b>Freeform</b> Fabrication are what we recognize today as rapid prototyping, 3D printing or additive manufacturing: Swainson (1977), Schwerzel (1984) worked on polymerization of a photosensitive polymer {{at the intersection of}} two computer controlled laser beams. Ciraud (1972) considered magnetostatic or electrostatic deposition with electron beam, laser or plasma for sintered surface cladding. These were all proposed but it is unknown if working machines were built. Hideo Kodama of Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute was the first to publish an account of a solid model fabricated using a photopolymer rapid prototyping system (1981). Even at that early date the technology was seen as having a place in manufacturing practice. A low resolution, low strength output had value in design verification, mould making, production jigs and other areas. Outputs have steadily advanced toward higher specification uses.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the existing soft actuators are fabricated using multistep low yield processes such as micro-moulding, <b>solid</b> <b>freeform</b> fabrication, and mask lithography. However, these methods require manual fabrication of devices, post processing/assembly, and lengthy iterations until maturity in the fabrication is achieved. To avoid the tedious and time-consuming aspects of the current fabrication processes, researchers are exploring an appropriate manufacturing approach for effective fabrication of soft actuators. Therefore, special soft systems that can be fabricated in a single step by rapid prototyping methods, such as 3D printing, are utilized to narrow {{the gap between the}} design and implementation of soft actuators, making the process faster, less expensive, and simpler. They also enable incorporation of all actuator components into a single structure eliminating the need to use external joints, adhesives, and fasteners. These result in a {{decrease in the number of}} discrete parts, post-processing steps, and fabrication time.|$|E
40|$|Microfeeding of {{dry powder}} excited by {{ultrasonic}} vibration {{makes use of}} relatively simple equipment and {{can be applied to}} <b>solid</b> <b>freeforming</b> and pharmaceutical dosing. The nozzle was a vertical glass capillary and four configurations for ultrasonic actuation were investigated: Type I had a piezoelectric transducer ring bonded to the base of a cylindrical water-containing vessel containing an axial nozzle; Type II had a piezoelectric transducer ring attached to the sidewall of the vessel; Type III used direct mechanical connection to the glass wall of the capillary to give nominally longitudinal vibration; and Type IV also used direct connection to the glass tube but arranged to give progressive wave vibration. The experimental results show that all four configurations realized powder microfeeding and dosing but the characteristics, in terms of minimum flow rate, dependence on voltage amplitude and uniformity of dose varied considerably. The discharge of particles was observed by a high-speed camer...|$|R
40|$|The {{flow rate}} of powder {{in an open}} {{vertical}} capillary subject to transverse acoustic vibration is predicted using an explicit equation by considering the intermittent arrest and stasis of particles subject to acceleration in a field. The analysis rests solely on physical quantities that are easily measured by experiment. The calculation is supported by measured flow rate and by direct observation using high speed photography. Increasing the horizontal component of acceleration of a particle should not influence rate of descent but the overall time of flight is increased both by re-initiation of descent after collision at the wall and by fixed stationary periods on each cycle. Since flow stops when acoustic vibration stops, the vibrating tube is a valve that provides computer-controlled powder flow metering, mixing and dispensing. The valve is capable of adjusting the flow rate with a ratio of minimum to maximum flow rate of 0. 1. It {{is being used to}} make three-dimensional functional gradients by <b>solid</b> <b>freeforming</b> operations, notably selective laser sintering...|$|R
40|$|Second {{generation}} <b>solid</b> <b>freeforming</b> devices {{will have}} the capability to render both shape and the spatial arrangement of composition directly from a computer file. In order to build three-dimensional functional gradients in selective laser sintering it is necessary to have a computer-controlled mixing and dispensing system. We report such a system based on the horizontal acoustic vibration of vertical capillary tubes that provides both switching and flow rate control. An orchestra of such tubes can be constructed to deposit a multi-component system onto a building platform. Our concern is the initiation of flow. It requires an “attack” waveform to break the domes that provide flow arrest and release the potential energy of powder above the dome. The intensity of attack also influences the mass that flows out before a new dome forms, i. e., the response time of the valve. Neither the extension to vibration caused by ringing nor the wave amplitude account for the over-run of the valve. Much better correlation is obtained with acceleration and with calculated kinetic energy of horizontally vibrating particles. <br/...|$|R

40|$|New {{opportunities}} for <b>solid</b> <b>freeforming</b> (SFF) will emerge when {{not just the}} shape but the spatial arrangement of composition can be rendered from a computer file. This paper describes a method for dispensing programmed mixtures of dry powders. It provides both on/off and flow rate control in open capillaries using acoustic vibration. In a glass capillary attached to an electromagnetic transducer, the wave characteristics of the forced vibration control both flow rate and switching of powder flow. The flow rate of powder can be predicted by an explicit model {{on the basis of}} intermittent arrest and stasis of particles in the gravitational field. Forced vibration can reduce the flow rate by a factor of 0. 1. Since flow stops when acoustic vibration stops, the vibrating tube is a valve that provides computer controlled powder flow metering, mixing and dispensing. The effects of acoustic frequency, amplitude, tube diameter, mechanical damping and particle size distribution have been investigated. The overflow (discharge from the open tube after vibration stops) was brought below 1 mg. The dispensing device is being used to make three-dimensional functional gradients by selective laser sintering (SLS). <br/...|$|R

After applying the LDI sampling based membership classification, the most challenging part, a trimmed adaptive contouring algorithm, is developed to reconstruct the mesh surface from the LDI samples near the intersected regions and stitch it to the boundary of the retained surfaces. Our method of approximate Boolean operations holds the advantage of numerical robustness as the approach uses volumetric representation. However, unlike other methods based on volumetric representation, we do not damage the facets in non-intersected regions, thus preserving geometric details much better and speeding up the computation as well.
