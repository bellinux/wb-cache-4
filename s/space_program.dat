5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s {{at the height}} of the Cold War, the United States Army {{conducted}} a classified feasibility study that proposed the construction of a manned military outpost on the Moon called Project Horizon with the potential to conduct a wide range of missions from scientific research to nuclear Earth bombardment. The study included the possibility of conducting a lunar-based nuclear test. The Air Force, which at the time was in competition with the Army for a leading role in the <b>space</b> <b>program,</b> developed its own similar plan called Lunex. However, both these proposals were ultimately passed over as the <b>space</b> <b>program</b> was largely transferred from the military to the civilian agency NASA.|$|E

With the breakup of the Union, the Crimea region, although mostly populated by ethnic Russians, found itself part of the newly independent Ukraine and the center was put under Ukrainian national control, prompting new political hurdles.|$|E
