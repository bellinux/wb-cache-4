5|$|Another change {{under the}} second and third Qajar king was the Africanization of the motif. At this time, the lion was an African lion which had a longer mane and bigger body {{compared}} to the Persian lion. Yahya Zoka <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> modification was influenced by contact with Europeans.|$|E
5|$|After awakening, Jon Snow {{is greeted}} by Davos Seaworth and Melisandre. When asked by Davos {{what he can}} remember, Jon says he remembers only his {{assassination}} but nothing from being dead. Melisandre tells Jon that her religion prophesies the return of a heroic prince and <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> prince may not be Stannis, as she first thought, but Jon. Jon enters the courtyard {{to meet with the}} wildlings. He meets with and embraces Tormund Giantsbane and Dolorous Edd, Tormund saying the Wildlings think he is a god.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that {{the origin of the}} heat as manifested in Io's many volcanoes is tidal heating from the pull of gravity from Jupiter and its moon Europa, the volcanoes are not in the positions predicted with tidal heating. They are shifted 30 to 60 degrees to the east. A study published by Tyler et al. (2015) <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> eastern shift may be caused by an ocean of molten rock under the surface. The movement of this magma would generate extra heat through friction due to its viscosity. The study's authors believe that this subsurface ocean is a mixture of molten and solid rock.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s Antoine Lacassagne, using {{polonium}} provided by his colleague Marie Curie, showed that the element has a specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues, with high concentrations, particularly in liver, kidney, and testes. More recent evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> behavior results from polonium substituting for its congener sulfur, also in group 16 of the periodic table, in sulfur-containing amino-acids or related molecules and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues. Polonium is indeed an element naturally present in all humans, contributing appreciably to natural background dose, with wide geographical and cultural variations, and particularly high levels in arctic residents, for example.|$|E
5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Heins recounts how the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) {{advocated}} for its associated organizations to add Parental Advisory warnings on labels of music albums {{as a way}} to advise parents about possible offensive content. She describes how the Parents Music Resource Center, co-founded by Tipper Gore, and hearings held by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, which included Senator Al Gore, led to attempts at censorship by lawmakers in eight individual states. Heins <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> subsequently led to the industry's self-regulation, which the author sees as self-censorship, and blacklisting of certain albums by music stores.|$|E

Little also suggests that it is likely that Rogers gained his maritime experience with Yeamans' ship on the Newfoundland fleet. Rogers completed his apprenticeship in November 1704.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{research}} at the Duke Lemur Center {{has shown that the}} ring-tailed lemur can organize sequences in memory and retrieve ordered sequences without language. The experimental design demonstrated that the lemurs were using internal representation of the sequence to guide their responses and not simply following a trained sequence, where one item in the sequence cues the selection of the next. But this is not the limit of the ring-tailed lemur's reasoning skills. Another study, performed at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve, <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> species along with several other closely related lemur species understand simple arithmetic operations.|$|E
5|$|Neville's {{household}} {{records for}} 1207 survive, detailing his itinerary for the year; in one eight-week period his household visited eleven different towns. In 1204 his wife offered the king 200 chickens {{for the right}} to sleep one night with her husband, an obligation recorded in the royal records. The historian Daniel Crook <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> shows that Joan Neville was one of the barons' wives who attracted King John's sexual attentions.|$|E

5|$|Some repairs {{were made}} in 1604 by Alessandro Stafrace, after cracks {{appeared}} in part of the Main Hall. The auberge had an entrance facing a square in South Street, but this was blocked in 1629 when the square was built up (the square was recreated in 2012 as Jean de Valette Square). Historian Giovanni Bonello <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the main entrance of the auberge, although it might have just been a side entrance. In 1649–50, a mezzanine was built beneath the Admiral's Room, and a large room {{at the rear of}} the building was converted into four shops in 1654. The archives were constructed in 1678.|$|E
5|$|The foregut of the tammar wallaby {{contains}} {{species of}} bacteria {{belonging to the}} phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Within the phylum Proteobacteria, species of the family Succinivibrionaceae are the most abundant and a new species named WG–1 was discovered. WG–1 is a capnophilic bacterium. This has important environmental implications as the bacteria produces less methane than others and does not require CO2 to survive. Research <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> information {{could be used to}} reduce carbon production in livestock.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographical}} {{isolation and}} recent glacial history of Shetland {{have resulted in}} a depleted mammalian fauna and the brown rat and house mouse are two of only three species of rodent present on the islands. The Shetland field mouse is the third and the archipelago's fourth endemic subspecies, of which there are three varieties on Yell, Foula and Fair Isle. They are variants of Apodemus sylvaticus and archaeological evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> species was present during the Middle Iron Age (around 200 BC to AD 400). It is possible that Apodemus was introduced from Orkney where a population has existed since at the least the Bronze Age.|$|E

50|$|For instance, {{studies of}} {{polystyrene}} (Tg ~ 110 °C) have noted a secondary transition near room temperature. Temperature-frequency {{studies showed that}} the transition temperature is largely frequency-independent, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> transition results from a motion of {{a small number of}} atoms; it has been <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{is the result of the}} rotation of the phenyl group around the main chain.|$|R
5|$|The {{primary unit}} of social {{organisation}} in Germanic and Celtic Europe was the kin group. The mention of descent through the female {{line in the}} ruling families of the Picts in later sources and the recurrence of leaders clearly from outside of Pictish society, {{has led to the}} conclusion that their system of descent was matrilineal. However, this has been challenged by a number of historians who argue that the clear evidence of awareness of descent through the male line <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> more likely to indicate a bilateral system of descent, where descent was counted through both male and female lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{disguise}} are unknown. Hingley notes that many contemporary publications attempted to suggest women had {{played a role in}} their creation, perhaps to make them sound less threatening. He suggests that anonymity might have been necessary to protect Bloxam's position at Rugby, but notes Rugby was quite progressive, which makes this unlikely; and, finally, suggests modesty as a possibility. Ian Ridpath, noting the plagiarism of the art from A Celestial Atlas, <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> alone might be sufficient to cause the author to wish to remain anonymous.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Pareh was {{followed}} by a shift in genres popularised by the local cinema. The Teng Chun, who– together with Balink– continued to be the only active filmmaker in the country until 1937, began focusing on more modern stories and those which would be popular with native audiences. Biran <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was influenced by Pareh. Other filmmakers in the late 1930s, partially inspired by Pareh, began {{to improve the quality of}} the audio in their films. Pane notes that, following Pareh, films produced domestically no longer centred around ethnic European casts.|$|E

5|$|The three paleontologists Xiaoming Wang, Richard H. Tedford, and Ronald M. Nowak have {{proposed}} that C.dirus evolved from Canis armbrusteri, with Nowak stating that specimens found in Cumberland Cave, Maryland, appear to be C.armbrusteri diverging into C.dirus. The early wolf from China, Canis chihliensis, {{may have been the}} ancestor of both C.armbrusteri and the gray wolf C.lupus. The sudden appearance of C.armbrusteri in North America during the Early Pleistocene <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was an immigrant from Asia, as was C.lupus later in the Pleistocene. In 2010 Francisco Prevosti proposed that C.dirus was a sister taxon to C.lupus.|$|E
5|$|A bone {{unique to}} pterosaurs, {{known as the}} pteroid, {{connected}} to the wrist and helped to support a forward membrane (the propatagium) between the wrist and shoulder. Evidence of webbing between the three free fingers of the pterosaur forelimb <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> forward membrane {{may have been more}} extensive than the simple pteroid-to-shoulder connection traditionally depicted in life restorations. The position of the pteroid bone itself has been controversial. Some scientists, notably Matthew Wilkinson, have argued that the pteroid pointed forward, extending the forward membrane. This view was contradicted in a 2007 paper by Chris Bennett, who showed that the pteroid did not articulate as previously thought and could not have pointed forward, but rather inward toward the body as traditionally thought. Peters (2009) proposed that the pteroid articulated with the ‘saddle' of the radiale (proximal syncarpal) and both the pteroid and preaxial carpal were migrated centralia. This view of the articulation of the pteroid has since been supported by specimens of Changchengopterus pani and Darwinopterus linglongtaensis, both of which show the pteroid in articulation with the proximal syncarpal.|$|E
5|$|All five of David's early books {{remained}} in print {{half a century}} later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is because she consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking in the countries she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books {{paved the way for}} other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr ("the galloping gourmet"), and Robert Carrier.|$|E
