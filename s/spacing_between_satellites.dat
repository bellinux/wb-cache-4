The last two, which are fluorescent cationic dyes were shown to bind to serum proteins. In addition immunohistochemical staining for endogenous albumin was performed. One long-term study was done in which rhodamine-labelled bovine albumin was injected subcutaneously, once daily, for one week. With all these methods, {{it was possible to}} show that blood vessels in the brain were impermeable, whereas those in circumventricular organs were permeable, thus validating their application to regions in which the existence of permeable vessels was questionable.;Rhodamine-labelled bovine albumin was seen in all the extracellular spaces in sympathetic and sensory ganglia, even after short times in the circulation. The endoneurium of peripheral nerve contained this tracer only in rats in which it had been injected daily for one week. At no time did this fluorescent albumin enter the enteric ganglia. Positive immunohistochemical staining for endogenous albumin was present in the enteric nervous system, in the endoneurium of peripheral nerve, in the <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> <b>satellite</b> cells and neurons in sensory ganglia, and around neurons in sympathetic ganglia. Horseradish peroxidase, which is present in the blood for about 5 minutes following intravenous injection, penetrated the enteric nervous system, and the extracellular <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> <b>satellite</b> cells and neurons in sensory ganglia, but it did not enter the endoneurium of peripheral nerve. The fluorochromes acriflavine and ethidium entered enteric, sympathetic and sensory ganglia, but not the endoneurium of peripheral nerve.;In conclusion, the enteric nervous system, sympathetic and sensory ganglia are permeable to most circulating macromolecules. The endoneurium of peripheral nerve is permeable only to macromolecules that are present in the circulation for at least one week, so the transudation or diffusion in this tissue must occur more slowly than elsewhere. These permeabilities may explain how some pathogens enter the nervous system...|$|R

Such constellations are often assembled from {{families of}} circular orbits, which ensures a uniform <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> <b>satellites</b> in each circular ring. However, {{there is a}} large class of elliptical orbits which are of practical interest including Molniya-like orbits and so-called Magic orbits [1, 2]. Constellations of satellites using such elliptical orbits will then exhibit a time varying <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> <b>satellites</b> as the orbital angular velocity experienced by each satellites varies around the elliptical ring. While current constellations use relatively modest numbers of satellites, future microspacecraft [3] or ‘smart dust’ type devices [4, 5] may enable constellations with extremely large numbers of nodes. In this Note a continuum approach is used to model the dynamics of such constellations. A continuity equation is formed to describe the evolution of the number density of nodes as a function of both true anomaly and time. For small eccentricities, the continuity equation can be solved analytically to provide closed-form solutions which describe the evolution of the constellation for some initial distribution of nodes. The closed-form solutions can then be used to investigate pattern formation in elliptical rings. Wave-like patterns are found which circulate around the elliptical ring, with peaks in density which can in principle be used to provide enhanced coverage. A similar continuum approach with a continuity equation has been used in previous studies to develop closed-form solutions which model the time evolution of the radial distribution of constellations of microspacecraft under the action of air drag [6, 7]...|$|E

The upper part of the bicrystal was thinned down to 25 mum in order to allow the X-ray beam to penetrate down to the interface.

No superstructures were detected along the tilt direction but, surprisingly, satellites were seen in the 010] direction perpendicular to the tilt direction in the neighbourhood of the (002) and (004) Bragg reflections. The <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> the <b>satellites</b> was 0. 02 reciprocal lattice units, which corresponds to a spacing of 195 A along the interface.

Figure  1 b shows the linear relationship <b>between</b> FWHMs and <b>satellite</b> peak orders. The slope of the fitting line {{is related to the}} QW/QB interface roughness. The fitting results show that interface roughness is gradually reduced as the H 2 percentage increases, and the optimum value is achieved at 6.25 % of H 2 (S 3), as shown in Table  1. With further raising in the percentage to 50 % (S 5), the interface roughness is increased dramatically. Hence, the ratio of H 2 during barrier growth has great impact on interface quality. A small percentage (0 – 6.25 %) of H 2 is favorable to obtaining sharp interface, while a large amount of H 2 (50 %) seriously roughens the interface.|$|R
40|$|A {{relationship}} is derived, on a single-entry interference basis, for the minimum allowable <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> two <b>satellites</b> {{as a function}} of electrical parameters and service-area geometries. For circular beams, universal curves relate the topocentric satellite spacing angle to the service-area separation angle measured at the satellite. The corresponding geocentric spacing depends only weakly on the mean longitude of the two satellites, and this is true also for alliptical antenna beams. As a consequence, if frequency channels are preassigned, the orbital assignment synthesis of a satellite system can be formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem or approximated by a linear programming (LP) problem, with the interference protection requirements enforced by constraints while some linear function is optimized. Possible objective-function choices are discussed and explicit formulations are presented for the choice of the sum of the absolute deviations of the orbital locations from some prescribed ideal location set. A test problem is posed consisting of six service areas, each served by one satellite, all using elliptical antenna beams and the same frequency channels. Numerical results are given for the three ideal location prescriptions for both the MIP and LP formulations. The resulting scenarios also satisfy reasonable aggregate interference protection requirements...|$|R

While also allowing saving of on-board power and shrinking {{of the size of the}} communication terminals, it presents more challenges in terms of the need of extremely precise pointing between the two partners involved in the link. Successful laser communication tests have been performed, e. g. <b>between</b> two <b>satellites</b> in <b>space</b> and <b>between</b> a <b>satellite</b> and a ground based fixed partner. A link through the atmosphere involving airborne moving terminals experiences disturbances like base-motion vibrations, fast relative motion and disturbances within the medium of propagation.

The traditional way to cope with misalignment is to operate two subsystems in parallel – a coarse pointing and a fine pointing one. The current work researches on the possible technologies for the so-called fine pointing assemblies.

30|$|Currently, the {{geostationary}} orbit (GEO) is extremely congested {{in the commercial}} Ku band with only a 2 ° <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> the <b>satellites.</b> Small aperture terminals have a wide field of view and consequently will transmit {{a significant amount of}} power toward adjacent satellites, causing the interference at these satellites to increase, which is a main constraint {{for the development of the}} satellite communications on-the-move system. In order to limit the interference to neighboring satellites, International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has imposed strict limits on the off-axis emissions from the satellite terminal [1]. As the current satellite communications on-the-move systems are always developed on the higher frequency bands, e.g., Ku and Ka bands, which also provide larger bandwidth. Code division multiple access (CDMA) with spread spectrum is a necessary choice to reduce the interference toward the adjacent satellites. However, the multiuser CDMA system is always interference-limited, and the transmit power of the terminal needs to be increased for higher performance, which leads to the increase of the interference. This is also not acceptable for the power-sensitive small aperture terminals. Moreover, the transmission distance is always very long in satellite systems, which causes different and long transmission delays of different CDMA users. In the satellite communication system, the maximum transmission delay may be several milliseconds. Just as the assumption in [2], the inter-symbol interference (ISI) is always not considered in the CDMA satellite system, in which the power of the main path is much higher than that of the multipath components. Therefore, the satellite communications on-the-move system with CDMA can be seen as a typical asynchronous CDMA system with the transmission delays which are the integer multiples of chip, in which the orthogonality of different CDMA users’ spreading codes is destroyed and the robustness of the interference suppression for the asynchronous case is necessary.|$|R
