40|$|The {{study on}} <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> {{has shown that}} the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> is a {{particularly}} important and urgent issue in the industry. Especially in the electronics industry with its strong OEMs and weak suppliers the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> should be a standardized method in a company and therefore needs to be taken into account. Companies increasingly recognize the importance of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management,</b> due to globalization and the associated increasing distribution of value-added activities, as well as the expansion and the growing complexity of the <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> The study also shows that <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> must analyze and be based upon both strategic and operational risks. Another interesting finding of the study is that the quality of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> decreases with a shrinking vertical range of manufacture, and also that the process quality along the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> is reduced {{on the way to the}} end consumer. This is an important discovery for the electronics industry, since the distribution of value added and the vertical range of manufacture among the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> partners is low in the electronics industry. It has to be said that future research about the topic of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> should focus on broadly based case studies conducted in the European Union and the other economic areas for significant, transnational equation. The developed process model has to be mitigated to other industries and branches. Therefore, future research will be concentrated on the development of methods for a process model that can be used and implemented in any industry and industrial sector. The described process model was developed to help SMEs in the electronics industry to evaluate the criticality of their <b>supply</b> <b>chains.</b> The methodology and the process model provide a systematic procedure that supports companies to minimize risks, enables companies to enhance their performance thanks to more stable <b>supply</b> <b>chains,</b> increases the productivity of companies by reducing the supply-related waiting times, and supports companies to increase their competitiveness based on a stabilized <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>Chain</b> risk <b>management</b> will be a key success factor for companies in a globalized world if they have implemented a risk management process in their organizational structure...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The first {{purpose of}} the paper is to define the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> as a network through the Viable System Approach (VSA). Secondly, the paper aims to link the VSA to <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management,</b> {{assuming}} a network perspective. Design/methodology/approach - Anchored at literature review on VSA and <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management,</b> this paper presents a <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> framework for high tech sectors, including considerations on network measurements. Findings - This paper presents a network approach to <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> in high tech sectors, according to the VSA perspective. Assuming the network as unit of analysis means using the dyadic dimension as a tool and not longer as a termination. A proper methodological tool is presented and underpinned in the existing literature. Research limitations/implications - The theoretical nature of this study requires empirical research validation. The VSA perspective in reading the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> as a network is a step forward in the literature related to the System Theory. Researchers and companies can use the framework for <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> as a path to ensure a coherent risk management process along the <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> Practical implications - The network analysis {{is presented as a}} perspective to manipulate the <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> network dimensions to ensure <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> continuity.

40|$|Background: <b>Supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> {{increasingly}} gains {{prominence in}} many international industries.

Method: By aligning a theoretical-conceptual framework with empirical-inductive findings, it may be hypothesized that logistical systems do {{have a positive effect}} on <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> activities. 	 Result/conclusion:  Flexibility and capacity, as well as redundancy and standardization, are often viewed as being conflictionary.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to provide {{companies}} {{with an understanding of}} how Swedish apparel companies manage supplier risks connected to production activities located in China. In order to conduct this study, previous literature regarding <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> has been analysed in relation to the empirical data collected during this study. In order to answer the research question, a qualitative method and a deductive approach have been used. A qualitative method was chosen as {{a deeper understanding of the}} phenomenon <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> was desired. A deductive approach was further chosen as the topic was acknowledged by reading previous research, which clearly emphasized existing research gap within <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management.</b>   The literature review presented in this thesis regards the importance of managing a global <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> and the risks connected to a global <b>supply</b> <b>chain.</b> Presented is also a process of how to manage risks, and the process consists of three steps, which further provides alternative strategies in order to conduct each step. Further, the reasons why Swedish companies outsource production activities to China and the importance of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> in China is presented. The literature review is finalized with a conceptual framework summarizing the chapter. Differences and similarities between collected empirical data and the literature review is discussed and analysed in the analysis chapter. The following chapter provides conclusions answering the research question as well as theoretical and practical implications. This thesis has contributed with filling the research gap regarding <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management,</b> this as the thesis focuses on one specific market and one specific industry. A new framework has been constructed based on previous research and the empirical findings. This framework also contributes to the practical implications as companies with a desire to outsource to China can use the process presented in the framework. The process includes three steps which will facilitate for companies to manage supplier risks in China. This thesis has also contributed to create an understanding for companies regarding the great importance of <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management.</b> Therefore, this thesis can contribute with valuable information for Swedish apparel companies wanting to include <b>supply</b> <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> when outsourcing to China...|$|R
