30|$|Assuming that Rubik’s Cube is {{operated}} by certain number operations and specified operations {{from the original}} state {{back to the original}} state again, this means the Rubik’s Cube achieves a cycle. The circulation period is the number of times the Rubik’s Cube is rotated. If the circulation period is a constant, the cycle is periodic.

The <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> a nonperiodic cycle is based on both the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> periodic cyclic <b>operations</b> and the “constant process” <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> that causes the cube’s pattern to exhibit a nonperiodic change.

The waste heat from the cylinder jackets and diesel exhaust then maintained the boiler in steam for auxiliary functions (brakes and whistle) and in readiness to supplement the diesel power if required, or for the next start. By using steam for starting, no form of variable transmission was necessary and a permanent reduction geartrain of 1·878 to 1 ratio was fitted.|$|E

50|$|The {{automatic}} {{wire stripper}} was first patented in 1915 by Stuart G. Wood of Brooklyn, NY. The design was refined by Herman Gerhard Jan Voogd of the Netherlands eliminating the awkward 4 bar mechanism {{taking on the}} general outline that it has kept since. Wood, now of Rockville IL, added reinforcements, replaceable blades, and blade stops in 1943 The 1943 design was also equipped to block the halves open after stripping to avoid crushing the freshly stripped wire as it returned to its rest position. A second actuation released the mechanism {{to return to the}} rest position. The action was further refined by Wood and finally by Eugene D. Hindenburg of DeKalb, IL. The final refinement of the action shifted the sequence of operations so that the stripping blades opened before any other part of the mechanism began to return to the rest position while the clamping jaws retraced the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> remaining closed until the handles were fully released.|$|E

50|$|New South Wales {{signalling}} systems generally follow British precepts, however American {{influence has}} increased somewhat since the 1990s. Originally trains {{ran on the}} time-interval system and authority of the timetable. From the early 1870s, several near-misses and minor derailments led to serious discussion of improved safe-working arrangements and the implementation of interlocking. Despite this, very little action was taken until 1877, when a new rule book including the Staff & Ticket and Block Telegraph systems was finally printed. The ink was barely dry on 30 January 1878 when two trains collided head-on at Emu Plains, killing three. This {{put an end to}} timetable working on single lines. Absolute Block Telegraph for double lines came in 1879, Saxby & Farmer's mechanical interlocking in 1881, Tyer's Electric Tablet in 1888 (lasting until 1959) and the Electric Staff system in 1891. Tyer's One-Wire Block began to replace the original Preece's Patent instruments from 1891. Sykes' Lock & Block was used on a few suburban sections from 1900. Tyer's Three-Wire Block was used for permissive block working on the Up Relief line from Concord West to North Strathfield Junction from 1911 until 1983. In 1913, the two-wire New South Wales Standard Block, which was similar in principle to Lock & Block, became the standard for new installations. It was unique in having a fourth position, known as Train Arrived, and a different <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> to standard British arrangements. The last of these instruments were removed from Exeter, Bundanoon and Wingello on the Main South line in 2007. By 1907, the majority of signalling equipment, including signals and mechanical lever frames, were being manufactured in-house {{under the direction of the}} English-born signal engineer, Mr C.L.N.F. Wilkin. The NSWR Signal Engineer's Branch supplanted McKenzie & Holland as the principal supplier in most installations.|$|E

30|$|Two recent {{features}} of BETA were not exercised via the BETA tool on {{this study and}} are {{described in more detail}} in [29]: the calculation of a preamble for each one of the test cases and the concretization of the test data. The generated preamble is a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> calls that takes the system to the intended state to execute the test case. BETA uses information about the state required to run the test case, extracted from the test case formulas, and then uses ProB to find a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> calls that will put the system in the intended state. Test data concretization can be done manually, using the test engineers own criteria, or automatically, using the concretization feature in the BETA tool. When done automatically, BETA uses the B-method’s gluing invariant to find the relationship between abstract variables and concrete variables.|$|E

40|$|International audienceService-oriented {{applications}} are typically {{built out of}} existing web-services (WSs) possibly made available by third party vendors. This requires that the application {{has to be able}} to evolve when the composing WSs are not anymore available or when new, more useful ones, are published. In this setting, an important problem is to understand how to use WSs showing an interface that differs from the one the application has been built to. The problem becomes even more complex when we consider conversational WSs, i. e., WSs that expose operations that have Input/Output (I/O) data dependencies among them. This paper presents a complete development methodology to the automatic synthesis of adapters for conversational WSs starting from their WSDL interface. The result is a tool-supported methodology that takes as input the WSDL of a pair of services and automatically builds a script that maps a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> invocations on a “WS to be replaced” into an equivalent <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> invocations on the “replacing WS”.
