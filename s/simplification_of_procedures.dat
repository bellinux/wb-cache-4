40|$|The {{integration}} of different methodologies and <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> is surely {{one of the}} most important current themes in survey techniques for researching cultural heritage, especially for architectural heritage.  The traditional methods for the metric survey of an architectural building (including micro geodesy and the stereophotogrammetric survey) are currently being consolidated. However, in the field of the architectural, artistic and archaeological survey, new technologies are now available and this knowledge needs to be more widely used, especially where the heritage is greater and so maintenance is as necessary as it is onerous. This report proposes some operative considerations, which derive from experience developed using the most modern technologies available, in order to compare and discuss the achievable accuracies (even if they are not always strictly necessary) and the operating modalities, especially for architectural surveys. So, the aim of this report is to verify that the <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> and cheaper solutions do not bring variations to the necessary metric precision or expert photointerpretation analysis. However, it is clear that, without considering the purposes and objectives of the survey, it would not be correct to appraise the survey methods and to classify those using reliability and accuracy criteria.

Here the SAW atomizer was used for ultrasound (acoustic) extraction of insulin and other peptide hormones released from freshly prepared islets, stimulated directly on a membrane. A high energy propagating SAW atomizes the membrane-bound liquid into approximately 2 μm diameter droplets, rich in cell-released molecules. Besides acting as a sample carrier, the membrane provides a purification step by entrapping cell clusters and other impurities within its fibers. A new SAW-based sample-matrix deposition method for MALDI MS was developed and characterized by a strong insulin signal, and a limit of detection (LOD) lower than 100 amol was achieved.

40|$|The {{importance}} of SMEs in any economy cannot be overlooked as {{they form a}} major chunk in the economic activity of nations. India has nearly three million SMEs, which account for almost 50 per cent of industrial output. However, SMEs which form the backbone of industrial development in India are not export competitive and contribute only about 34 percent of exports. It is this feature of the SMEs that make it an ideal target to realize its potential export competitive. Drawing from the experiences of countries that have successfully promoted the export competitiveness of SMEs, this paper has identified ways in which SMEs in India can have an access to external markets through exports, which include <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures,</b> incentives for higher production, preferential treatments to SMEs in the market development fund, linking up SMEs with Transnational Companies or large domestic exporting firms; and formation of clusters and networks in order to reinforce their external competitiveness. ...|$|E
