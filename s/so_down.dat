25|$|Britain's early {{preference}} for smaller warships was {{mainly because of}} a requirement to maintain a large navy {{and to keep the}} expense of doing <b>so</b> <b>down.</b> However, by {{the latter half of the}} 1770s, Britain was facing a war with France, Spain and the United States of America, and was in need of a more powerful type of frigate. In 1778, the Navy Board ordered the first of two new types of frigate, one with 38 guns, the Minerva-class, and the other with 36, the Flora-Class. Both had a main battery of 18 pounder guns. Crescent was ordered on 11 August 1781 and was to be of the 36-gun variety.|$|E
