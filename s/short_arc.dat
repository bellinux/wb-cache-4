5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no short-circuiting takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with <b>short</b> <b>arc</b> GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E
25|$|The {{radar beam}} has a width of about 10 degrees, and pulses 2.5 degrees, so a target will {{not produce a}} single blip, {{but a number of}} them. For targets located far from the centreline, the radar would produce 4 or 5 {{individual}} blips as the scanner rotated, causing a <b>short</b> <b>arc</b> about 10 degrees wide to show on the display. A somewhat more complex interaction occurs as the target aircraft approaches the centre of the radar scan. Any target within ten degrees of the centreline will always have some radar energy falling on it no matter where the dish is pointed; a target five degrees {{to the right of the}} aircraft would still be reflecting the outer edge of the broadcast even when the scanner is pointed five degrees to the left. In this case the target will create blips throughout the entire rotation, drawing a complete ring on the display instead of a <b>short</b> <b>arc.</b> Because the antenna is more sensitive in the middle than the edges, the ring on the display will vary in brightness as the dish scans, reaching its maximum when the dish is aimed at the target, and a minimum, or disappearing entirely, when it is pointed the other direction. A target that is dead ahead will produce a complete uninterrupted circle on the display.|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} {{realised}} that the spiral-scan did provide angle-off information, through simple geometry and timing. Since the radar beam had a finite width, about five degrees, it would see some return {{even when the}} target was not centred in the beam. A target far from the centreline would only be illuminated when the dish was pointed in that direction while rotating rapidly away from it. The result as a <b>short</b> <b>arc</b> on the display about 10 degrees long. A target closer to the centre, say five degrees to port, would be illuminated strongly when the dish was pointed to the left, but still receive a small signal {{even when it was}} pointed to the right. That meant it produced a varying return almost through the entire rotation, creating a much longer arc, or a complete circle if the target was dead ahead.|$|E
40|$|We derive the {{plasticity}} equations for convex quadrilaterals on {{a complete}} convex surface with bounded specific curvature and prove a plasticity principle which states that: Given four <b>shortest</b> <b>arcs</b> which meet at the weighted Fermat-Torricelli point their endpoints form a convex quadrilateral and the weighted Fermat-Torricelli point belongs to the interior of this convex quadrilateral, an increase of the weight corresponding to a <b>shortest</b> <b>arc</b> causes a decrease of the two weights that correspond to the two neighboring <b>shortest</b> <b>arcs</b> and an increase of the weight corresponding to the opposite <b>shortest</b> <b>arc</b> by solving the inverse weighted Fermat-Torricelli problem for quadrilaterals on a convex surface of bounded specific curvature. Furthermore, we show {{a connection between the}} plasticity of convex quadrilaterals on a complete convex surface with bounded specific curvature with the plasticity of some generalized convex quadrilaterals on a manifold which is certainly composed by triangles. We also study some cases of symmetrization of weighted convex quadrilaterals by introducing a new symmetrization technique which transforms some classes of weighted geodesic convex quadrilaterals on a convex surface to parallelograms in the tangent plane at the weighted Fermat-Torricelli point of the corresponding quadrilateral.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{for the analysis}} of low-low intersatellite range-rate data in a gravity mapping mission is explored. The technique is based on standard tracking data analysis for orbit determination but uses a spherical coordinate representation of the 12 epoch state parameters describing the baseline between the two satellites. This representation of the state parameters is exploited to allow the intersatellite range-rate analysis to benefit from information provided by other tracking data types without large simultaneous multiple data type solutions. The technique appears especially valuable for estimating gravity from <b>short</b> <b>arcs</b> (e. g., less than 15 minutes) of data. Gravity recovery simulations which use <b>short</b> <b>arcs</b> are compared with those using arcs a day in length. For a high-inclination orbit, the short-arc analysis recovers low-order gravity coefficients remarkably well, although higher order terms, especially sectorial terms, are less accurate. Simulations suggest that either long or <b>short</b> <b>arcs</b> of GRACE data are likely to improve parts of the geopotential spectrum by orders of magnitude...|$|R
500|$|Manual gas {{tungsten}} arc welding {{is a relatively}} difficult welding method, due to the coordination required by the welder.

Maintaining a <b>short</b> <b>arc</b> length, while preventing contact between the electrode and the workpiece, is also important.|$|E
500|$|Danielle Jones is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Lauren Crace. The character appeared between 18 August 2008 and 3 April 2009.

In October 2008, it was revealed that Danielle was actually the long-lost daughter of established character Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack). Crace has disclosed that even she was unaware of this fact upon being cast in the role, but always knew Danielle would only have a <b>short</b> <b>arc.</b> Danielle's feelings were further explored in a segment of the BBC EastEnders homepage entitled Danielle's Diary, documenting the character's thoughts on the storylines she was involved in, while a special episode of EastEnders Revealed entitled [...] "The Secret Mitchell" [...] further explored the character's impact on the show.|$|E

Lauren Crace, then a third year student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, was cast as Danielle and began filming in June 2008. EastEnders was Crace's first professional acting role, and executive producer Diederick Santer expressed his pleasure that Crace had chosen to make her debut on the show. Upon her introduction, EastEnders producers attempted to deceive the audience into believing Danielle {{was nothing more than a}} new friend for Stacey. [...] Crace herself was only told of Danielle's true identity after her successful audition, though as she only signed a six-month contract with the show, was always aware Danielle would only have a <b>short</b> <b>arc.</b> She stated that some audience members guessed Danielle to be Ronnie's daughter almost as soon as she arrived, and that she found maintaining the secret difficult.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{effect of}} ball {{imbalance}} (either static or dynamic) {{is the ability}} to introduce gyroscopic effects on the rotation. The component of imbalance along the rotation axis provides a leverage that can change the orientation of the axis on its horizontal plane, an action physicists call precession. It is basically the same thing as a spinning toy top [...] "going around in a circle." [...] In the case of a rotating bowling ball, as it moves along the lane, there is only time for its total rotation axis to move along a <b>short</b> <b>arc,</b> but this is enough to reorient the total rotation so that some of the forward-roll becomes side-roll, increasing the side-roll provided in the bowler's delivery, thereby achieving more hook. It is possible to use dynamic ball balancing to achieve a stronger gyroscopic effect than static balancing alone.|$|E
