40|$|Floating {{water wheel}} could harvest energy from shallow flowing river to {{increase}} the potential of hydropower. Various types of water wheels have been studied by other researchers. However, {{the details of the}} design such as ridge/blade profile, number of ridges and <b>submerged</b> <b>depth</b> of floating water wheel have not been clearly established. In this research, experiments were carried out in an aquarium to study the optimum number of ridges, <b>submerged</b> <b>depth</b> and four different ridge profiles for a laboratory-scale floating water wheel. The results showed different ridge profiles and pitches and <b>submerged</b> <b>depths</b> contribute significant effects to the rotation of floating water wheel. The result of the experiment was used as reference for prototype design and fabrication. The prototype was tested in a river and successfully produced voltage from the flowing river. The experiment shows that the optimum number of ridges is 13, the best profile is thin flat ridge and maintaining the floating water wheel at certain <b>submerged</b> <b>depth</b> is important to its performance. The prototype concept is suitable for low head flow and varying water level. It is also portable, easily assembled and maintained and able to convert the kinetic energy of the water current into electrical energy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{experimental}} {{device is}} designed to control slag entrapment of molten steel with ElectroMagnetic Brake(EMBR). Mercury was taken to simulate the liquid steel flow in the mold. The factors which affect slag entrapment with EMBR are studied, such as position of magnets, distribution of magnetic flux density and <b>submerged</b> <b>depth</b> of Nozzle. Experimental {{results show that the}} posibility of power entrapped by liquid steel was smallest as magnetic flux density B= 0. 3 T, meanwhile, it was found that F value decreases with increasing immersion depth. Indeed, the occurrence probability of the slag entrapment decreases while d= 45 mm (d is distance from the centre of SEN to the centreline of magnetic core.) instead of d= 25 mm.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a non-hydrostatic wave model SWASH (an acronym of Simulating WAves till SHore) {{is used to}} {{simulate}} the wave transmission over double trapezoidal submerged breakwaters. The numerical results were compared {{with the results of}} the physical model. The comparison indicated the capability of SWASH model to predict the wave transmission over double submerged breakwaters. Influencing factors such as breakwater spacing S/L 0, where L 0 is the deep-water wavelength, and current were investigated in detail. Moreover, the effects of current on wave transmission were also analyzed. When the relative <b>submerged</b> <b>depth</b> R/H, where R is the <b>submerged</b> <b>depth</b> and H is the wave height, remains at 1. 0, the appropriate relative breakwater spacing S/L 0 is about 1. 11.

40|$|A {{high speed}} towed vehicle “FLYING FISH” is being {{developed}} to measure chemical and physical properties of the ocean. The depth, pitch and roll of FLYING FISH are controlled by a main wing and horizontal tail wings. The roll control {{is based on the}} PID control method and the depth and pitch control are based on the LQI (linear quadratic with integral) control method. The LQI controller was designed in consideration of the mathematical model of the towing cable. The experimental results controlled by the LQI controller were successful around the near equilibrium point but it seems that the performance is reduced at far field. The reason is that towing tension is drastically changing with the <b>submerged</b> <b>depth</b> of the vehicle and the linear mathematical model of the towing cable changes from that of equilibrium point. In this paper, the H_infty controller is designed in consideration of the change of the towing tension at the towing point versus <b>submerged</b> <b>depth</b> in order to improve the performance of the depth and pitch control.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 This thesis {{presents}} the results of an experimental and analytical study of single-port buoyant turbulent jets discharged into shallow water. The experimental results include the measured downstream dilution, centerline concentration and trajectory. Independent parameters considered were Froude number, <b>submerged</b> <b>depth,</b> discharge angle and velocity ratio. Results indicate that decreasing the discharge depth provides earlier occurrence of surface effect and greatly decreases dilution. Dilution increases with decreasing Froude number. Increasing the discharge angle from the horizontal into cross current increases the dilution ratio. The effect of ambient current on dilution depends on the angle of discharge. For cross-flow discharges, the dilution rate decreases with increasing ambient current, while for co-flow discharge the reverse trend was observed. As plumes reach the water surface, the dilution rate increases with increasing ambient velocity. The jets bend over rapidly for cross-flow discharges when large ambient currents are present. The analytical portion of this report presents an integral method proposed by Davis (1975) for merging multiple buoyant jets. This merging model was used to simulate the single-port buoyant jet in shallow water. This was done by using an image method where the <b>submerged</b> <b>depth</b> was simulated by the spacing between images. The entrainment function as presented by Kannberg and Davis (1978) was used except for a modification within the zone of merged plumes. Comparisons of the model prediction were made with experimental data. Results indicate that good predictions are obtained for buoyant jets discharging at 0 and 45 degrees into shallow water by using the image method as long as the Froude number is above 13. 5. For lower Froude number and vertical discharges, model predictions are only fair...|$|R

This study proposed a backward parapet as a countermeasure to reduce weight of armor units. A numerical simulation showed the difference in the velocity field behind the caisson between the backward and forward parapet.

Furthermore, hydraulic model tests showed that the stable weight was approximately 40 % less than that of the forward parapet...|$|R

40|$|Hydropower {{plants are}} {{the main source of}} {{renewable}} energy from moving water. However, traditional dam systems are somewhat controversial since they are large and often require population relocation, disrupt fish migration, and change the natural flow of the river. Hydrokinetic systems are currently being developed which can harness energy from flowing water with less ecological impact. One hydrokinetic system that may be promising, a hydrokite system, consists of an oscillating arm, boom, and a translating hydrofoil. Due to the hydrodynamic forces caused by the water 2 ̆ 7 s velocity, the hydrokite moves back and forth extracting energy from the flow. Previous simulations have shown that power production for this system depends on at least ten different parameters. Little experimental work has been done on hydrokite systems to validate the results of these simulations. This work focused on the experimental testing of a lab-scale hydrokite system. Tests were run to determine the system power trends with respect to hydrofoil angles, boom flip angles, pivot-point location on hydrofoil, tow speed, and hydrofoil <b>submerged</b> <b>depth.</b> Single dimension parameter tests were done to determine the changes in average cycle power for the system as a function of a given parameter. Power production was highly sensitive to changes in hydrofoil angles (for hydrofoils pivoting at both the quarter and half-chord point). The optimal hydrofoil angle for the tests that were run was approximately β = 60 ° - 80 °. As predicted, the power production increases with increased tow speed and <b>submerged</b> <b>depth,</b> neglecting energy used to flip the hydrofoil. Changes in boom flip angle did not significantly affect power production for the quarter-chord tests, but appeared to be significant in the half-chord tests. Although the largest power produced in all of this testing was approximately 0. 14 Watts, this initial testing of the lab-scale system has given us some insight into the important design decisions that will need to be made in order to scale-up the system...|$|R
