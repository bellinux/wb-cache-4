5|$|After {{saying goodbye}} to {{everyone}} in the bar, Diane returns to the office and accidentally hits Sam's nose when she opens the door. Because of that, she is convinced that Sam was coming out of the office to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> her. They argue, admit their feelings for each other, and come into the terms that their relationship with Derek is nothing compared to their potential relationship together. Sam and Diane embrace, but then Diane rejects his advances, i.e. attempts to kiss her. They insult each other and, at the end, kiss passionately.|$|E
5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> him. I decided against it.|$|E
25|$|By November 2006, Kip and B.G. {{began to}} show displeasure in TNA and {{threatened}} to go find work elsewhere {{if they did not}} receive gold soon. They began performing the crotch chop, a reference to the WWE's DX. On the November 2 edition of Impact!, Kip and B.G. threatened to quit. Kip grabbed the mic and tried to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> the TNA administration and Spike TV, but each time his mic was cut off. Kip then tried to use the announcer's headset, but it was cut off as well. Frustrated, he started yelling loudly to the crowd, but he was cut off again as the show went to a commercial break. When the show returned, the announcers speculated that they may have been frustrated due to the influx of new talent entering TNA. It was reported that the segment was a worked shoot that Vince Russo had written in order to renew interest upon their eventual return. Kip and BG appeared in an internet video on TNA's website where they addressed the owner of WWE Vince McMahon.|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] {{contains}} {{an allusion to}} the 1989 film, Batman, with the line, [...] "You're my number one guy". In an interview with The Fader magazine, Taylor said the reference {{was a result of}} thinking about the Batman film, which has many things that Taylor is fond of, such as the Prince soundtrack. He commented that sometimes those items [...] "seep into what we're writing about" [...] and said that he likes to reference [...] "in an oblique way". He conjectured that he had included the line to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> [...] "everyone in the band, particularly to Joe , 'You're my number one guy, why is there any problems between any of us?'

500|$|Kinsler, who is Jewish, {{and whose}} father is Jewish {{while his mother}} is Catholic, has become a {{prominent}} figure in the Jewish community, and enjoys the attention that he attracts from it. He was featured in the 2008 Hank Greenberg 75th Anniversary edition of Jewish Major Leaguers Baseball Cards, licensed by Major League Baseball, commemorating the Jewish major leaguers from 1871 through 2008. He joined, among others, teammate Scott Feldman, Brad Ausmus, Kevin Youkilis, Ryan Braun, Gabe Kapler, Jason Marquis, Jason Hirsh, John Grabow, Craig Breslow, and Scott Schoeneweis. Kinsler {{was one of three}} Jewish players in the 2008 All Star Game, joining Youkilis and Braun. He says that [...] "Youkilis will always <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> me on the bases [...] 'Happy Passover,' he'll throw something at me." [...] In July 2013 he passed Shawn Green with his 163rd steal, to become the all-time career steals leader among Jewish major leaguers.|$|E
500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{the effect that}} the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E

500|$|Later in the tournament, on 18 June 2012, Mario Balotelli scored {{his first}} goal {{in a major}} {{international}} tournament in a 2–0 victory against the Republic of Ireland. When he attempted to celebrate this goal, he was immediately halted by teammate Leonardo Bonucci, who covered Balotelli's mouth with his hand for fear that the striker would <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> [...] "get in trouble." [...] Balotelli had been dropped to the bench by Cesare Prandelli prior to the game due to his lack of ability shown in his previous group games, so when he was subbed on against Ireland fans didn't expect him to {{have much of an}} impact, and his celebration of his goal may have originally been directed towards the naysayers who believe he is bad for the team. Balotelli went on to start against England in the quarter-finals, his performance was described as wasteful but his effort was rated highly in a game where he missed multiple chances. He scored the first penalty taken in the shootout against his Manchester City teammate Joe Hart. On 28 June, Balotelli scored twice within the first 40 minutes in Italy's semi-final clash with Germany, as the Azzurri won 2–1 and progressed to the Euro 2012 final against European and World champions Spain. After scoring the second goal in that semi-final, he ripped off his shirt and stood motionless as he flexed his muscles, developing a famous celebration. Going into the final Balotelli said that, Manchester City's title success meant that failure in the Euros would not signal a personal failure this season. He also said that he was unfazed by the pressure he supposedly has on his shoulders going into the final, with new high expectations of him from his home supporters after his amazing performance against Germany.|$|E
2500|$|According to Plutarch, {{after the}} assassination, Brutus stepped forward {{as if to}} <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> his fellow senators; they, however, fled the building. Brutus and his companions then marched to the Capitol while crying out to their beloved city: [...] "People of Rome, we are once again free!" [...] They were met with silence, as the {{citizens}} of Rome had locked themselves inside their houses {{as soon as the}} rumour of what had taken place had begun to spread. Caesar's dead body lay where it fell on the Senate floor for nearly three hours before other officials arrived to remove it.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a motion}} to censure is passed, the chair (or the vice-president, if the {{presiding}} officer is being censured) addresses the censured member by name.

( [...] This phrase should not be included as the cause for censure may have occurred outside of meetings.) [...] "A censure is a warning. It is the warning voice of suspension or expulsion. Please take due notice thereof and govern yourself accordingly." [...] Or, if the chair is being censured, the vice-president may say, [...] "Mr. X, you have been censured by the assembly for the reasons contained in the resolution.

2500|$|Queen {{said that}} to stand out in the male-dominated world of reggaeton, {{she would have to}} deliver a strong point of view from a female perspective, saying, [...] "God blessed me with a {{powerful}} voice. It is not feminine. It is not masculine. It is just a thick voice." [...] Queen also stated that her achievements are all {{due to the fact that}} she is an artist who, “always [...] something to <b>say,</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> contribute. [...] never came with empty rhythm or lyrics. [...] the girl that could write and sing and go to the platform and kill, as we say”. She created music people's bodies could move to but was consistent in standing her ground and standing for agency and women empowerment with lyric like in [...] "Quiero Baliar" [...] where she states [...] "Yo quire bailar/Tu quires sudar/Y pegarte a mi/El cuerpo rozar/Yo the dig si tu me suedes provocar/Eso no quiere decir qui pa la came voy". In these lyric she explicitly states she wants to dance, and her partner wants to sweat, and as long as she gives her partner the go ahead they can provoke her, but it still does not give her partner permission to think she is sexually bound to them, because according to Ivy, that is a common misunderstanding when regarding certain forms of reggaeton dance. Since beginning her career, Queen has wanted to create and compose songs [...] "that have some kind of subject matter" [...] so that people understand the concept and message. Instead of the vulgar lyrics common in reggaeton, Queen prefers to sing about defending women while touching on themes of social political matters, homosexuality, racism, love and heartbreak. Queen says she writes songs that [...] "put bad men in their places or stand up for the single mothers". In [...] "Que Lloren" [...] she discusses romance from a woman's perspective while belittling the stereotype that men shouldn't cry or show emotions. In [...] "Quiero Bailar" [...] she [...] "berates a lover who thinks that just because they dance she is automatically going to bed with him." [...] "Mi Barrio" [...] is a socio-political charged song which criticizes [...] "the problems present in Añasco, Puerto Rico". Queen compared the song to [...] "Corazones" [...] by Daddy Yankee from his album Barrio Fino.|$|E
