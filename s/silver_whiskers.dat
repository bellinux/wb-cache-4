50|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>whiskers</b> {{often appear}} in {{conjunction}} with a layer of silver sulfide which forms on the surface of silver electrical contacts operating in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen sulfide and high humidity. Such atmospheres can exist in sewage treatment and paper mills.|$|E
5000|$|This dense black solid {{constitutes}} the tarnish that forms over time on silverware and other silver objects. Silver sulfide is insoluble in all solvents, but is degraded by strong acids. Silver sulfide is a network solid {{made up of}} silver (electronegativity of 1.98) and sulfur (electronegativity of 2.58) where the bonds have low ionic character (approximately 10%). It is a component of classical qualitative inorganic analysis. When formed on electrical contacts operating in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen sulfide, long filaments known as <b>silver</b> <b>whiskers</b> can form.|$|E

25|$|Because in the past, silver casings had {{problems}} with <b>silver</b> migration and <b>whiskers</b> which led to increasing leakage currents and short circuits, new styles of wet tantalum capacitors use a sintered tantalum pellet cell and a gelled sulfuric acid electrolyte mounted in a pure tantalum case.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{cathodic}} {{deposition of}} <b>silver</b> <b>whiskers</b> as microwires in the electrochemical cell Ag/AgBr/Ag has been investigated. From growth experiments observed with an optical microscope, {{we conclude that}} the growth process occurs exclusively at the interface of the silver wires with the solid electrolyte. The basal contacts of the microwires show different morphologies without clear correlation to the substrate. The silver crystals often show a hexagonal morphology, but XRD gives no def-inite information {{on the structure of}} the wires. The measured exchange current density is in the order of 100 mA/cm 2. The growth rate and the diameter of the microwires can be controlled by variation of the current...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} it method for growing copper-based nanowires. The method {{is based on}} the unusual {{modification}} of a halogenated Copper Surface by exposure to I helium plasma. The nanowires have diameters ranging between 50 and 150 run and lengths up to 50 mu m. They are polycrystalline, and large parts of the wires have it pronounced core-shell structure with a dense shell and less material inside. The wires are grown in it plasma environment at room temperature, and large amounts can be grown in a matter of minutes. The critical process parameters for the growth process are the gas now and pressure Settings, and the impact thereof will be discussed in detail. In order to gain insight in a possible growth mechanism, Out observations are compared with literature oil the growth of <b>silver</b> <b>whiskers</b> from halogenated silver crystallites. Finally, photoluminescence spectra of the wires are discussed in view of the analytical data about the stoichiometry and structure of the nanowires. status: publishe...|$|E
