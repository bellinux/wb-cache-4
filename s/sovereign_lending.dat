5000|$|Finally, it is {{worthwhile}} to consider how credit rationing might arise as a feature of sovereign (government) lending, that is, lending to countries. <b>Sovereign</b> <b>lending</b> {{is a very different}} story than domestic lending, due to the absence of enforcement mechanisms in the case of bankruptcy, as there is no internationally acknowledged agency for such issues. If a country {{for one reason or another}} announces that it is either unable or unwilling to pay its debts, the most international lenders can do is renegotiate. Some experts believe that the threat of the country being shut off from financial markets if it defaults is not credible, as it has to be the case that absolutely no-one is willing to lend. Others stress that though this might be true for the short trem, there are other reputational reasons why a country might want to avoid debt repudiation, mainly pertaining to the maintenance of good foreign relations, which allows access to international trade and technological innovations ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how <b>sovereign</b> <b>lending,</b> i. e. {{the practice of}} lending capital to sovereigns, has changed since the early nineteenth century. It tackles this question by investigating how lenders have thought about sovereigns {{for the past two}} centuries, focusing on the tools they have used to know and represent them. I argue that there was a critical shift {{in the early twentieth century}} in terms of the kinds of knowledge lenders deployed to know sovereigns. This shift differentiates the old <b>sovereign</b> <b>lending</b> from the new. In the old <b>sovereign</b> <b>lending,</b> merchant banking families such as the Rothschilds knew sovereigns through intensely personal relations based on gentility, whereas in the new <b>sovereign</b> <b>lending,</b> joint stock banks, credit rating agencies and international institutions largely came to know sovereigns through statistics. Though difficult to imagine nowadays, the description of sovereigns through quantifiable facts (the original definition of âstatisticsâ) was revolutionary for early twentieth century lenders. Despite constituting the origins of sovereign credit ratings, this key shift has been overlooked in all major studies about sovereign debt. The new <b>sovereign</b> <b>lending</b> rose to prominence from the interwar period to the 1970 s and now defines our world. The identification of this crucial shift is based on the development and application of the concept of forms of knowledge. Forms of knowledge refer to enduring ways of knowing and representing the constituent units of the international system used by international practitioners (e. g. diplomats, military strategists, financiers, and international lawyers). Examples of forms of knowledge include, but are not limited to, modern cartography, international treaties, statistics, gentility, and heraldry. The use of this concept is that it leads to a better understanding of how international practitioners and their practices undergo radical changes. In so doing, it provides a firmer empirical grasp on the question of how fundamental discontinuities arise in international relations. </p...|$|E

A large cost of tight fiscal policy shifts the balance towards immediate liquidity provision. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} Official Sector {{institutions}} as lenders in crisis situations has evolved over time, and, particularly {{in the context of}} the current euro area debt crisis, into something akin to a lender of last resort. Institutions like the International Monetary Fund regularly provide distressed <b>sovereigns</b> with <b>lending</b> at affordable rates when private funding has dried up. To be able to provide this kind of emergency relief in a manner that does not result in large losses for their stakeholders, these Official Sector institutions often assert that their lending will have de facto priority over private lending. As a practical matter, since other creditors could not sue to interfere with the sovereign’s choices regarding whom to pay and in what order, de facto priority was all that was needed in the past for the system to function. All of this may have changed since October 2012 as a result of one case: NML Capital v. Republic of Argentina. This case has given private creditors, for the first time in history, a weapon with which they can go after payments made to any other creditor that has equal legal priority to them, potentially including any Official Sector institution without de jure priority. This leads to the question of whether Official Sector institutions’ half-century-old claim of de facto priority for their lending status can be said to have evolved, as a matter of customary international law, to a level of de jure priority...|$|R

While there are many commonalities between recent and past crises, {{both in terms of}} underlying causes and policy responses, there are some important differences in terms of the scale and scope of interventions. Direct fiscal costs to support the financial sector were smaller this time as a consequence of swift policy action and significant indirect support from expansionary monetary and fiscal policy, the widespread use of guarantees on liabilities, and direct purchases of assets. While these policies have reduced the real impact of the current crisis, they have increased the burden of public debt and the size of government contingent liabilities, raising concerns about fiscal sustainability in some countries.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} growth and regulation of small-sum lending to the poor in the United States, from the Progressive Era through the War on Poverty in the 1960 s. It looks beyond familiar accounts of middle-class borrowing and federal regulation to borrowing by working-class people and the state-level laws and institutions that governed their loans. It draws on archival material {{from a variety of}} sources, including the records of courts, legislative and executive branch officials, social service agencies, philanthropic organizations, legal aid providers, and lenders 2 ̆ 7 trade associations. ^ This perspective reveals another dimension of American political economy. Much scholarship shows how in the twentieth century federal power displaced older forms of governance rooted in state and local law. In contrast, 2 ̆ 2 City of Debtors 2 ̆ 2 shows the continued importance of economic regulation at the state level. Dozens of separate (and sometimes competing) state <b>sovereigns</b> governed small-sum <b>lending</b> with little interference from federal authorities. Yet, the economy was national in scope, meaning that money and ideas flowed easily across state boundaries. This created opportunities for lenders to engage in regulatory arbitrage, as well as obstacles for state officials trying to police the lending industry. ^ This dissertation also shows how the problems of small-sum borrowers tested the limits of state regulatory power and muddied the boundary between the 2 ̆ 2 public 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 private 2 ̆ 2 spheres. Most histories of poverty law focus on the rules governing welfare provision, a matter of public law. By exploring poor people 2 ̆ 7 s interactions with the law of the marketplace, 2 ̆ 2 City of Debtors 2 ̆ 2 shows how judges and policymakers came to see a public interest in the rules governing poor people 2 ̆ 7 s private contracts. Because a bad bargain could turn a poor debtor into a pauper, the public had a legitimate interest in regulating small-sum loans, state officials concluded. Concerns about poverty and avoiding 2 ̆ 2 dependence 2 ̆ 2 thus offered new and powerful justifications for increased state intervention in the marketplace. ...|$|R
40|$|It can be {{said that}} the pari passu clause mistakenly {{migrated}} from secured private lending to unsecured <b>sovereign</b> <b>lending.</b> Once rooted in unsecured <b>sovereign</b> <b>lending</b> instruments it faced certain provisions like the ones in Spain or the Philippines that can allow a creditor to create a preference positioning itself in a better position vis-a-vis other creditors, and become a 'must have' provision in this type of debt instruments. Then, pari passu clauses stayed in unsecured debt instruments due to the fear of the earmarking revenues or the risk of the sovereign preferring a group of creditors over another. These two fears were tackled by an expanded negative pledge clause and the Libra and Allied Bank cases. Therefore, if a proper due diligence was conducted {{there was no need to}} have a pari passu clause unless in exceptional circumstances alike the ones of Spain or the Philippines. Unfortunately, a misguided interpretation of the pari passu clause in the Elliot case opened the door to litigation on incorrect grounds (payment interpretation or broad interpretation of the pari passu clause). It was an 'aberration', but one that caused furore. The problem was that in Elliot there was no breach of the pari passu clause, just a wrong understanding of its meaning. In the case of Argentina the whole story could be different since it can be correctly interpreted as a breach of the pari passu clause in its ranking or narrow form. The importance of this article lies precisely in explaining the different interpretations of the pari passu clause in sovereign debt instruments in context to provide a clear understanding of the issue for the sake of the international capital markets...|$|E

Concerted agreements in which debt repurchases are linked to cuts in interest rates or new money requirements can make buybacks at the fair price viable, while preventing the free-rider problem among lenders.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} a two-sector small open economy with locked − in capital accumulation and limited enforcement of for-eign debt. Two possible self-enforcing lending schemes are studied. When lending is incentive constrained, a debtor’s repayment utility never falls below its default option. Alternatively, creditors may set target debt/export ratios to keep repayment resources at least as large as default at every point in time. Simulations of the model by genetic algorithms under a wide range of parameter sets demonstrate that the two lending policies generate identical equilibria. We ana-lytically solve the repayment problem under the target debt/export constraint for its long-run equilibrium, and explicitly show the extent of inefficiencies due to limited enforcement.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{determinants}} of <b>sovereign</b> <b>lending</b> spreads. The objective of the first chapter is to identify and disentangle various risks embodied in foreign currency denominated sovereign bond spreads. Its empirical approach tries to attribute the explanatory power of country fundamentals in a spread equation to their predictive power for default and illiquidity risk. For this, I incorporate rational expectation predictions into the spreads and propose an IV estimation method. The over identification test offers a test whether the spread {{can be explained by}} predicted risk probabilities. Applying this approach to developing country bond data from 1975 to 1995, I find that the non-structural explanatory power of fundamentals can be completely attributed to their influence on predicted risk probabilities. The second chapter takes a broader view across all public <b>sovereign</b> <b>lending.</b> Data from the World Bank suggests that the average spread on all forms of borrowing by developing countries is smaller than for top-rated US corporate bonds. After documenting these facts (with particular care for resolving data problems), the analysis looks behind the averages. Once identifying various sub-types of borrowing, I find that official and other private lending (trade-related) are the main source of the low average spreads. Bond and commercial bank lending shows reasonable spreads. Unlike other and official, bond and bank lending move nearly one in one with world interest rates. All types of private lending significantly differ from each other in the way they incorporate country fundamentals. The third chapter offers a potential source of liquidity risk in bond markets: in a Diamond-Dybvig type model, where agents face a risk of becoming more risk-averse early consumers, changes in the speed of public learning about default risk may increase bond spreads, and decrease investor welfare. This effect operates through a link between future price volatility and current prices: increased expected future price volatility leads to lower prices today. by Peter Benczur. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} Markov equilibria in a {{model of}} strategic lending in which (i) agents cannot commit to long-term contracts, (ii) contracts are incomplete, and (iii) incumbent lenders can coordinate their actions. Default cycles occur endogenously over time along every equilibrium path. After a sequence of bad shocks, the borrower in a competitive market accumulates debt so large that the incumbent lenders exercise monopoly power. Even though the incumbents could maintain this power forever, they find it profitable to let the borrower regain access to the competitive market after a sequence of good shocks. Equilibria are computed numerically, and their attributes are qualitatively consistent with numerous known empirical facts on <b>sovereign</b> <b>lending.</b> In addition, the model predicts that a borrower who accumulates debt overhang will regain access to the competitive credit market only after good shocks. This prediction is shown {{to be consistent with}} data on emerging market economies. ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates {{that a lack of}} state capacity is a key determinant of internal armed conflict. Scholars identify several internal dimensions of state capacity, but have yet to explore how international finance influences state resources.

In this article, we explore this rela-tionship between a state’s integration into global credit markets and its subsequent capacity to promote domestic stability. We argue that international capital increases a state’s ability to respond to internal opposition because states with favorable credit terms can expand their resource base beyond domestic constraints to deter, accommodate, or repress opposition while maintaining a level provision of resources to their political base. We examine the influence that both capital access and credit terms have on the risk of civil conflict in 141 countries from 1981 to 2007.

40|$|We {{examine how}} {{relational}} contracting in credit and investment relationships {{is affected by}} the potential expropriation of funds. We implement credit relationships in which repayment is not third-party enforceable, i. e. borrowers can default on their loans. In our main treatment the borrower can expropriate the lender’s funds: a defaulting borrower can reinvest the loaned funds in future periods. In a control treatment borrowers cannot expropriate borrowed funds, i. e. if they default they cannot reinvest these funds in future periods. We find that potential expropriation decreases the overall volume of credit as lenders offer smaller loans in initial periods. Borrowers are more likely to default in earlier periods of the relationship when expropriation is possible, especially when they receive large loans. Together these results suggest that relational contracts may be particularly difficult to establish in markets where the expropriation of funds is feasible. This finding is relevant to credit markets in which lenders’ rights are weak, but also to <b>sovereign</b> <b>lending,</b> as well as to foreign direct investment in countries with weak investor protection. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines why {{investors are}} willing to finance government wartime borrowing. I challenge {{the conventional wisdom that}} investors have dovish prefer-ences by arguing that investors use the uncertainty of conflict outcomes to create lucrative investment opportunities.

As a result, investors will favor states that tend not escalate their conflicts. To test my theory, I rely on both qualitative and quantitative methods.

I then use event study analysis to analyze sovereign markets ’ reaction to the news of conflict. Finally, I analyze new data on <b>sovereign</b> <b>lending</b> to examine how sovereign credit costs affect decisions to initiate and escalate conflict.

Second, though, the authors go beyond the existing literature to argue that the net effect of multiple veto players depends onthe nature of social polarization in a country. In particular, they argue that political competition is fundamentally different in countries exhibiting ethnic polarization than in countries polarized according to income or wealth. The evidence supports the prediction that multiple veto players matter more when countries are more ethnically polarized, but less when income inequality is greater.

40|$|What {{sustained}} borrowing without third-party {{enforcement in}} the early days of <b>sovereign</b> <b>lending?</b> Philip II of Spain accumulated towering debts while stopping all payments to his lenders four times. How could the sovereign borrow much and default often? We argue that bankers ability to cut off Philip IIs access to smoothing services was key. A form of syndicated lending created cohesion among his Genoese bankers. As a result, lending moratoria were sustained through a cheat-the-cheater mechanism. Our article thus lends empirical support to a recent literature that emphasises the role of bankers incentives for continued sovereign borrowing. What sustains sovereign borrowing? An important school of thought argues that pun-ishment mechanisms outside the lending transaction itself are necessary to make governments pay (Bulow and Rogoff, 1989 a; Fernandez and Rosenthal, 1990). Other authors have emphasised the role of reputation and gains from intertemporal smoothing (Eaton and Gersovitz, 1981; Eaton and Fernandez, 1995). A recent litera-ture focuses on co-ordination and enforcement of moratoria amongst lenders (Kletzer and Wright, 2000; Wright, 2002; Kovrijnykh and Szentes, 2007). 1 Finally, some authors have argued that lender sentiment determines funding availability for sovereigns...|$|E
40|$|This {{briefing}} aims {{to clarify}} the notion of fiduciary responsibility in development financing and unpack the complex box of fiduciary conditions associated with development loans, grant aid and debt relief agreements. Towards this end, this briefing draws on data from {{a review of existing}} academic and institutional literature on the subject as well as an examination of the operational policies of main financing institutions, with specific reference to the financing instruments of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This briefing aims to serve as a background paper for discussions on the issues of fiduciary conditions in international <b>sovereign</b> <b>lending</b> from public institutions and forwards some issues to consider in and proposals for the design of fiduciary conditions in such financing agreements. The issue of fiduciary responsibility in development financing has been gaining importance in the discourses on aid and development lending of late. The recent international focus on increases in official development aid (ODA) for poverty reduction and humanitarian crises and debt relief for developing countries have resulted in greater attention being paid to the issues such as transparency, accountability and legitimacy in the processes of aid allocation and in the contracting of development loans...|$|E
