5|$|Hector and Tabitha leave. Katy is spooked by the house, {{especially}} when she finds a stuffed cat on the sofa. She sees an old photograph of Hector, Tabitha and Andras as children, but Andras does not look disabled. Katy's friend Shell arrives and plays with Hector's stairlift, sending it upstairs. Katy warns Shell not to break anything, and is <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the now-live cat. Katy tries to call her father so she can leave, but the house has no mobile phone signal and the house phone's party line is tied up. As she prepares to leave, the stairlift returns downstairs and Andras's bell rings. Katy is scared of going upstairs, but, at Shell's insistence, the two go to check on him.|$|E
5|$|Bashir is <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Kira {{appear as}} a Russian spy, who {{introduces}} herself as Colonel Anastasia Komananov, KGB. She has no idea who Major Kira is. Eddington informs Bashir and Garak that they can't shut down the program or let the characters die or else they will lose the patterns of the other crew members. Komananov explains that a scientist called Dr. Noah is planning {{to take over the}} world using lasers to cut into the Earth's crust resulting in the shrinking of the tectonic plates sinking and causing global flooding. Bashir's orders are to rescue Professor Honey Bare (Dax) from Noah. Falcon (O'Brien) attempts to assassinate Bashir, who must stop Komananov from killing him or else O'Brien's pattern will be lost. Bashir, Garak and Komananov go to a casino in Paris to speak to Duchamps (Worf), an associate of Noah. Bashir manages to buy his way into a meeting with Noah after winning the money at cards but the trio are knocked out by Duchamps using a powdered drug.|$|E
5|$|Mike visits Zoe in prison, despite Lydia {{manipulating}} him, and Zoe is able {{to convince}} him that she was not to blame for Sarah's death. During her trial, Mike tells the court he believes his daughter committed suicide, and Zoe is found not guilty and is released. She then decides to expose Lydia as Sarah's killer. Zoe moves in with Mike and Lydia, and tells Lydia that her feelings towards her have changed. The pair share a kiss, just as Mike and Amy walk in. Mike then tells Zoe to leave. Lydia discovers that Zoe is using her, and plots revenge. On New Year's Eve, she gets Zoe to meet her in a church, so they can admit their 'relationship' to Sarah. Zoe initially goes along with this, but then changes her mind, runs out and is knocked unconscious. Zoe {{is able to}} get a confession from Lydia, before running away again. She is <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Sarah's grave for the first time. Lydia finds Zoe and stabs her as Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki), Dave Colburn (Elliot James Langridge) and Mike arrive. Mike then cradles Zoe as he calls an ambulance.|$|E
2500|$|It's <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> such {{a highly}} {{successful}} mathematician achieve success in another field," [...] says Edward Witten, {{professor of physics at}} the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ, and considered by many of his peers to be the most accomplished theoretical physicist alive...|$|R
60|$|Anyway, he was perfect, as Dona Rita had declared. The {{only thing}} {{unsatisfactory}} (and even inexplicable) about our Dominic was his nephew, Cesar. It was <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a desolate expression of shame veil the remorseless audacity {{in the eyes}} of that man superior to all scruples and terrors.|$|R
50|$|Even {{in the age}} of Girls Gone Wild, it's {{genuinely}} <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a name actress throw {{caution and}} perhaps her career to the wind. But give the woman credit. Actresses have been asked and even bullied into performing similar acts for filmmakers since the movies began, usually behind closed doors. Ms. Sevigny isn't hiding behind anyone's desk. She says her lines with feeling and puts her iconoclasm right out there where everyone can see it; she may be nuts, but she's also unforgettable.|$|R
25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E
500|$|Miranda Callendar (Meera Syal), {{a detective}} {{employed}} by Claire, learns about Hyde and informs Jackman that Jekyll and Hyde was not fiction, but a fictionalized version of actual events. [...] Callendar shows Jackman {{a picture of}} the real Doctor Jekyll who lived in Edinburgh, Scotland in the 19th century. [...] Jackman is <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that Jekyll looks exactly like him, and that he died at around Jackman's current age; and Callendar speculates that he is a descendant of the original Doctor Jekyll, {{except for the fact that}} Doctor Jekyll had died without children.|$|E
2500|$|Mrs. Chalfont and her {{grandson}} appear to Laura. They warn {{her that the}} [...] "man behind the mask" [...] is in her bedroom. Laura runs home, where she sees BOB. She rushes outside in terror and is <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her father, Leland, emerge from the house. That evening Leland's behavior is erratic and abusive—he accusingly asks her about her romances, then tenderly tells her he loves her.|$|E
6000|$|He {{staggered}} back--with a livid {{change in}} his face <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> The mischief done by Mrs. Presty's sense of injury had led already to serious results. If the thought in Linley, at that moment, had shaped itself into words, he would have said, [...] "And Catherine never told me of it!" [...] How bitterly {{he thought of the}} woman who had left him in suspense--how gratefully he felt toward the woman who had lightened his heart of the heaviest burden ever laid on it! ...|$|R
60|$|The {{prison is}} an old convent, {{and it is a}} little <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the church façade, with a statue of the Madonna over the central porch. At the steps a number of women stood waiting with pots and jars and {{handkerchiefs}} full of food for their relatives within; and when the doctor appeared several rushed up to ask about a father or a son that lay sick. We went in and there was a melodramatic tinkling of keys and an unlocking of heavy doors.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{critical}} reviews were negative. For example, Gabe Toro of Indiewire wrote: [...] "The ideas {{behind the}} film are laughably primitive, and it's <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an actor of McDowell's caliber {{swept up in}} them. At the point where Satan begins taking credit for gangsta rap, it's clear that the ignorance that powers this film is borderline dangerous... In short, it's embarrassing on almost every level, poorly written, shot, scored and edited and bereft of a single idea, interesting or otherwise." [...] Mr Toro gave it a letter grade of F.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the evening, {{the disciples}} got into a ship to cross {{to the other side of}} the Sea of Galilee, without Jesus who went up the {{mountain}} to pray alone. John alone specifies they were headed [...] "toward Capernaum". During the journey on the sea, the disciples were distressed by wind and waves, but saw Jesus walking towards them on the sea. John's Gospel specifies that they were five or six kilometers away from their departure point. The disciples were <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Jesus, but he told them not to be afraid.|$|E
2500|$|Greenwich and Barry {{began dating}} after his {{marriage}} was annulled, but musically they continued separate careers. Still in college, in 1962, Greenwich {{got her first}} break in the business when she traveled to the Brill Building to meet John Gluck, Jr., one of the composers of the Lesley Gore hit [...] "It's My Party". Needing to keep another appointment, Gluck installed Greenwich in an office {{and asked her to}} wait. The office turned out to be that of songwriter-producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Hearing piano music from the cubicle, Leiber poked his head in and, expecting Carole King, was <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Greenwich, who introduced herself and explained her reasons for being there. Recognizing her potential as a songwriter, Leiber and Stoller agreed to allow her to use their facilities as she wished in exchange for first refusal on songs she wrote. They eventually signed Greenwich to their publishing company, Trio Music, as a staff songwriter.|$|E
2500|$|The light {{infantry}} rallied on the 5th Foot and 55th Foot, but {{the three}} British units were soon forced to withdraw. When the British army commander General Sir William Howe {{appeared on the scene}} he was <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his crack light infantry fleeing before the American advance. He yelled, [...] "For shame, Light Infantry! I never saw you retreat before. Form! Form! It is only a scouting party". After nearly being cut down by a blast of grape shot, Howe and his staff quickly rode off. The 2nd Pennsylvania Brigade soon struck a picket of the 46th Foot and swept it before them. Soon Wayne's men became anxious because fighting at the Chew House erupted several hundred yards in their rear. Isolated in the fog, Wayne ordered an about-face and his two brigades began to move back toward the noise of battle. The 2nd Brigade, now on the division's right, blundered into part of Major General Adam Stephen's division moving forward. In a tragic friendly fire incident, Stephen's men opened fire and the Pennsylvanians returned fire. Wayne's soldiers, fired on by their friends and confused by the fog, panicked and took to their heels. They finally rallied [...] from the battlefield.|$|E
6000|$|Edwin Forrest {{has been}} playing, {{for the last}} sixteen days, at the Broadway Theatre, but I never went <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him till last night. The play was the [...] "Gladiator." [...] I did not like parts of it much, but other {{portions}} were really splendid. In {{the latter part of}} the last act, where the [...] "Gladiator" [...] (Forrest) dies at his brother's feet, (in all the fierce pleasure of gratified revenge,) the man's whole soul seems absorbed in the part he is playing; and it is really <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. I am sorry I did not see him play [...] "Damon and Pythias" [...] the former character being his greatest. He appears in Philadelphia on Monday night.|$|R
60|$|But it was <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this {{excellent}} hearted Quakeress {{coming on}} board, {{as she did}} the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and a still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him {{a long list of}} the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.|$|R
60|$|Chancing to trip, in his abstraction, {{over the}} {{spreading}} root {{of an old}} tree, he raised his pious eyes to take {{a survey of the}} ground before him. It <b>startled</b> him <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the embodied image of his thoughts not far ahead. Mary herself. And alone.|$|R
60|$|The {{man from}} Red Rock ranch {{was very much}} <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Dick, {{and stared at the}} youth for several seconds without speaking.|$|E
60|$|And there I was <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what I {{took to be}} a wild man, with unkempt {{beard and}} ragged hair, {{pursuing}} a giant butterfly with brilliant wings.|$|E
60|$|Johnnie was wont {{to go on}} in this dreamy {{way without}} expecting an answer; but he was <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his father's face hidden by the shadowy fingers that propped his forehead.|$|E
60|$|She turned for one moment, {{and tried}} to look at Mr. Franklin. I say, tried, for she {{suddenly}} looked away again before their eyes met. There seemed to be some strange disturbance in her mind. She coloured up, and then she turned pale again. With the paleness, there came a new look into her face--a look which it <b>startled</b> me <b>to</b> <b>see.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Vespertine [...] is a {{young adult}} {{historical}} fiction romance novel by Saundra Mitchell. It follows the romantic journey of Amelia van den Broek while she develops her <b>startling</b> new ability <b>to</b> <b>see</b> into the future.|$|R
50|$|Mondrian {{produced}} Lozenge Composition With Four Yellow Lines (1933), {{a simple}} painting that innovated thick, colored lines instead of black ones. After that one painting, this practice remained dormant in Mondrian's work until {{he arrived in}} Manhattan, at which time he began to embrace it with abandon. In some examples of this new direction, such as Composition (1938) / Place de la Concorde (1943), {{he appears to have}} taken unfinished black-line paintings from Paris and completed them in New York by adding short perpendicular lines of different colors, running between the longer black lines, or from a black line {{to the edge of the}} canvas. The newly colored areas are thick, almost bridging the gap between lines and forms, and it is <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> color in a Mondrian painting that is unbounded by black. Other works mix long lines of red amidst the familiar black lines, creating a new sense of depth by the addition of a colored layer on top of the black one. His painting Composition No. 10, 1939-1942, characterized by primary colors, white ground and black grid lines clearly defined Mondrian's radical but classical approach to the rectangle.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was quite}} <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you, Geoffrey, but I am very glad. It is almost {{too hot for}} walking. Won't you let me drive you?" [...] she said with flurried haste.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so quick, Martell!" [...] {{came from}} the doorway, and then both of the youths were <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{themselves}} confronted by Bob Nixon. Behind the chauffeur stood Captain Dale, while in another doorway appeared the form of Professor Brice.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall await {{her return}} from chapel," [...] {{answered}} Ercole. He took {{the letter and}} departed. As he emerged into the courtyard he was <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the fool dash towards him, gasping for breath, and with excitement in every line of his quaint face.|$|E
60|$|Sixteen shillings a {{week was}} not much to keep a wife and child on. The room the couple lived in showed that their poverty was extreme. It was a fair size, but it looked quite large, since there was hardly any {{furniture}} in it; there was no carpet on the floor; there were no pictures on the walls; and most rooms had something, photographs or supplements in cheap frames from the Christmas numbers of the illustrated papers. The patient lay on a little iron bed of the cheapest sort. It <b>startled</b> Philip <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how young she was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall we never, {{never get}} rid of this Past?" [...] cried he, keeping up the earnest tone of his {{preceding}} conversation. [...] "It lies upon the Present like a giant's dead body In fact, the case is just as if a young giant were compelled to waste all his strength in carrying about the corpse of the old giant, his grandfather, who died a long while ago, and only needs to be decently buried. Just think a moment, and it will <b>startle</b> you <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what slaves we are to bygone times,--to Death, if we give the matter the right word!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Into {{the glare}} of the {{headlights}} there stepped a strange figure, strange, that is to say, in these tame modern times. In the Middle Ages he would have excited no comment at all. Passers by would simply have said to themselves, [...] "Ah, another of those knights off after the dragons!" [...] and would have gone on their way with a civil greeting. But in the present age it is always somewhat <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a helmeted head pop up in front of your motor car. At any rate, it startled Bream. I will go further. It gave Bream the shock of a lifetime. He had had shocks already that night, but none to be compared with this. Or perhaps it was that this shock, coming on top of those shocks, affected him more disastrously than it would have done if it had been the first of the series instead of the last. One may express the thing briefly by saying that, as far as Bream was concerned, Sam's unconventional appearance put the lid on it. He did not hesitate. He did not pause to make comments or ask questions. With a single cat-like screech which took years off the lives of the abruptly wakened birds roosting in the neighbouring trees, he dashed away towards the house and, reaching his room, locked the door and pushed the bed, the chest of drawers, two chairs, the towel stand, and three pairs of boots against it.|$|R
60|$|In the dining-parlour, {{as it was}} called, the now {{sick and}} sorry Betty was <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> at that late hour not her mother, but a man sitting, calmly {{finishing}} his supper. There was no servant in the room. He turned, and she recognized her husband.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never met}} him, you see. He only wrote to me. When {{he came to}} the station to meet us this evening he looked <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me; so I suppose he remembers my appearance. But Aline will have told him that my name is Simpson." ...|$|E
60|$|The bell rang, and Stephen {{went to the}} door. He was <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Mr. Brinsmade. That gentleman was {{suddenly}} aged, and his clothes were wet and spattered with mud. He sank into a chair, but refused the spirits and water which Mrs. Brice offered him in her alarm.|$|E

60|$|The East Side of New York. A {{whirlwind}} of noise and smell and hovering shadows. The jargon of Jewish matrons in brown shawls and orthodox wigs, chaffering for cabbages and black cotton stockings and gray woolen undershirts with excitable push-cart proprietors who had beards so prophetic {{that it was}} <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a frivolous cigarette amid the reverend mane. The scent of fried fish and decaying bits of kosher meat, and hallways as damnably rotten of floor as they were profitable to New York's nicest circles. The tall gloom of six-story tenements that made a prison wall of dulled yellow, bristling with bedding-piled fire-escapes and the curious heads of frowzy women. A potpourri of Russian signs, Yiddish newspapers, synagogues with six-pointed gilt stars, bakeries with piles of rye bread crawling with caraway-seeds, shops for renting wedding finery {{that looked as if}} it could never fit any one, second-hand furniture-shops with folding iron beds, a filthy baby holding a baby slightly younger and filthier, mangy cats slinking from pile to pile of rubbish, and a withered geranium in a tin can whose label was hanging loose and showed rust-stains amid the dry paste on its back. Everywhere crowds of voluble Jews in dark clothes, and noisily playing children that catapulted into your legs. The lunger-blocks in which we train the victims of Russian tyranny to appreciate our freedom. A {{whirlwind of}} alien ugliness and foul smells and incessant roar and the deathless ambition of young Jews to know Ibsen and syndicalism. It swamped the courage of hungry Carl as he roamed through Rivington Street and Essex and Hester, vainly seeking jobs from shopkeepers too poor to be able to bathe.|$|R
