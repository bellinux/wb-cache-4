40|$|In {{this article}} we address the question: ‘What <b>sub‐identities</b> of teacher {{educators}} emerge from the research literature about teacher educators {{and what are the}} implications of the <b>sub‐identities</b> for the professional development of teacher educators?’ Like other professional identities, the identity of teacher educators is a construction of various aspects or facets, which we prefer to call <b>sub‐identities.</b> We are interested to learn what <b>sub‐identities</b> might constitute the main identity of what we generically refer to as ‘teacher educators’ and, to achieve this, we set out to analyse the research literature relating to teacher educators to search for ways in which such <b>sub‐identities</b> might be explicitly or implicitly described. Based on the research literature we found four <b>sub‐identities</b> that are available for teacher educators: schoolteacher, teacher in Higher Education, teacher of teachers (or second order teacher) and researcher. We also found a view on teacher educators as teachers in a more generic way. There seems to be a broad understanding that teacher educators have to transform their identity as teachers to become ‘teachers of teachers in Higher Education’ and (increasingly) to become researchers of teaching and teacher education. The development of these <b>sub‐identities</b> depends on the context of teacher education in various national and institutional contexts and the development of teacher educators over time...|$|R

Kobayashi compressibility has remained a relatively obscure notion, {{with the exception of}} some work on resource bounded Kolmogorov complexity. The main goal of this note is to show that it is relevant to a number of topics in current research on algorithmic randomness. We prove that Kobayashi compressibility can be used in order to define Martin-Loef randomness, a strong version of finite randomness and Kurtz randomness, strictly in terms of Turing reductions. Moreover these randomness notions naturally correspond to Turing reducibility, weak truth-table reducibility and truth-table reducibility respectively. Finally we discuss Kobayashi's main result from his 1981 technical report regarding the compressibility of computably enumerable sets, and provide additional related original results...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Service {{industry}} {{has become the}} most important industry among various economic activities, as the percentage of service related industry in advanced nations is over 60 % of their GDP and the percentage of service industry in South Korea, a traditional manufacturing nation, now takes up over 60 % of the entire economy. Background: Such industry paradigm shift has changed consumers from those that simply purchased products into groups of people that evaluate the companies that manufacture products, thereby further intensifying competition among companies and increasing the importance of integrated communication between companies and consumers. However, the excessive existence of sub-identities that have been developed for integrated management of the existing corporate identities, as well as the undifferentiated general management strategies by companies are creating confusion not only for consumers but also for various corporate interest parties. In addition, service identity strategy {{has become the most}} important strategy than any other <b>sub-identity</b> strategies in forming corporate identity at the increased importance of corporate service in the era of service industry. However, the current domestic circumstance is that the concept of service identity has not been well established through specific related studies.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} and analyzes {{a household}} group religious ritual among the Bohra {{women of the}} Ismai'li Shi'i sect of South Asian Muslims. Bohras are a Gujarati speaking, endogamous group involved principally in petty trading. The sea has a well-organized cleric class which oversees the spiritual and often temporal concerns of the sea members. Bohra women engage {{in a variety of}} religious gatherings and rituals that often involve the fulfillment or anticipated fulfillment of a vow. A commonly observed ritual, performed in the name of Fatema Zehra-the daughter of the prophet-and known as Mithi Sitabi, focuses around motherhood and the vows of marriage. This paper highlights the role of this ritual in validating women's traditional roles and women's culture within Bohra society. From the women's point of view, these gatherings serve not only a religious but also an important social function within the community. From the perspective of the cleric class, these rituals establish boundaries for the structure and content of the practice of women's ritual gatherings. As such, they are an instrument by which the community traditions are preserved, community cohesiveness reinforced and a unique Muslim <b>sub-identity</b> maintained. Through an analysis of such religious ceremonies, this paper comments on and draws `conclusions about some gender perceptions of religious practices. It discusses the Bohras' unique interpretation of the Sitabi as an example of both the diversity and homogeniety that exists in South Asian Muslim religious life...|$|E

Whilst in Ambon communal violence erupted between Muslims and Christians from 1999 until 2004, armed conflict {{on the island of}} Mindanao is generally understood as a decade-long struggle between Muslim armed groups fighting for autonomy against a Christian-dominated Philippine state. Yet, despite these different types of armed struggle, in both cases, everyday tensions about resource access became incorporated in a complex conflict dynamic. These localized tensions are linked to <b>sub-identities</b> within the general Christian versus Muslim dichotomy, thereby creating alternative fault lines and alliances. In conclusion, this article puts forward a renewed understanding of armed conflict as a dynamic and transformative process, producing new opportunities, alliances, contradictions and narrative frameworks...|$|R

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study features in-depth interviews with selected continental African journalists and offers exploratory insights into how they perceive themselves {{in terms of}} their journalistic roles and/or sub-identities with regard to the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). The study also examines correlations between their perceptions and their news stories on NEPAD. Grounded in the libertarian and social responsibility theories of journalism, and reading these theories from the standpoint of Africa, this study posits the neutral, watchdog, social agenda and development journalism sub-identities to explain the respondents’ journalistic identifications. Hence, the study explores how the journalists respond to NEPAD’s (pan) -Africanist and development journalism interpellations. The study draws on postcolonial theoretical perspectives to address questions concerning African identity and the wider NEPAD/African context of research. Findings indicated that the journalists perceive a role for themselves as neutral-objectivist information disseminators as well as social agenda enactors that conscientise their readers about NEPAD. Thus, the journalists tend to implicitly portray a pluralistic understanding of their roles that enables them to balance the ideals of journalism against the development and Africanist aspirations of NEPAD. Although the journalists were found to uphold oppositional stances towards NEPAD, they do not question it from outside of its own neo-liberal discourse. In fact, they still represent themselves as aspiring to its Africanism and remaining sympathetic to its development plans. Overall, they exhibit multiple identifications, and yet they often tend to lean towards their neutral-objectivist journalistic <b>sub-identity.</b> Ultimately, they prioritise the dominant libertarian-professional model of journalism over and above NEPAD’s interpellations. The study also examined the journalists’ interpretations of what they do and the apparent translation of this into their stories. Although in both their stories and interviews discourse they showed a broader orientation towards libertarianism, the findings show that the link between the two is not straightforward...|$|E

The current research literature emphasizes that trans people engage in high-risk behaviors that result in higher rates of HIV infection and have difficulty in obtaining health services due to discrimination. Trans youth are reported to be at higher risk for HIV transmission than other youth, though no comprehensive studies exist. Trans youth are a diverse and complex population which researchers, health service providers, and educators currently know very little about. ^ In order better understand the specific health care needs of trans youth and improve education, outreach, and services, this qualitative study of 24 trans youth, sought {{to answer the following}} research questions: What are the specific needs of these trans youth related to HIV prevention and education from their point of view?

40|$|With the re-proclaimed {{independence}} of Kosova on 17 February 2008 {{and with the}} foundation (establishment) of Kosova’s state among the public opinion began to circulate the idea that “since Kosova became a state, now we can also find the “Kosova nation”, because every state should have his own nationality, different (divers) by other national-states. The {{aim of this study}} is to argue that the idea of the Kosova state has not born with the purpose to create the new national identity of Kosova’s people (so the Kosovo nation) because the Albanian national identity of Kosova has been solid, established and determined. Besides the political unit not necessarily imposes the changing the national identity of the people (even if in the occupation circumstances). In fact, the efforts of Kosova people for liberation, independence and state building had the aim to protect guarantee and cultivate their determined and formed Albanian national identity which was being violated by Serbia. The paper will explain the idea that the “Kosova identity” as the “new national identity of Kosova” is more an artificial construction that ignores the historical and political conditions on the road of Albanian of Kosova for independence, than a real natural identity aspiration of Kosova’s people. Moreover, this idea is in contradict with the theoretical principles of modern nation building in general. At the end, will be concluded that Kosova state was projected from elites and the people of Kosova as a second Albanian state, temporarily unable for the union with the (natural Albanian state), Albania, so the “Kosova’s identity” is only an Albanian <b>sub-identity</b> with distinguished characteristics, but this is normal for all the modern national identities. As an actual obstacle of natural compliance of the Albanian identity with the state of Kosova are the “Ahtisaar principles” of the actual Republic (the republic of 17 February); which the political elites of Kosova after 2007 accepted as a compromise for the “recognition” of Kosova independence from the Security Council of UN (even after this compromise the council does not recognize Kosova’s independence) ...|$|E

40|$|The rapid expansion, wider {{distribution}} and increased readership of print {{media in the}} latter half of the nineteenth century helped to foster the process that has been described as the nationalisation of English culture. In a parallel process, however, the same media could also be deployed to construct and to propagate regional cultures and identities. This thesis, concentrating on the period c. 1850 - 1918, uses Yorkshire as a case study. The employment of county boundaries and structures as a delimitation for historical research can be questioned. But it is defensible in the case of the cultural study of a county that, in spite of its size, heterogeneity and industrial transformation, had acquired a set of identities and stereotypes which evolved during the early-modern period and were retained, refined and celebrated in the industrial age. Although it had no political basis, Yorkshireness remained a powerful <b>sub-identity</b> within England, the United Kingdom and the wider British world. By examining the newspaper press, weekly periodicals, dialect almanacs and regional fiction, the thesis explores the evolution and the dissemination of Yorkshire’s cultural identity in an age of popular print. There is also an analysis of attempts to find a deterministic basis for Yorkshire character and a description of county societies in the UK and overseas. The evolution of folkloristic Yorkshire identities and symbols is traced, and illustrated dialect postcards of the early-twentieth century are analysed, on the grounds that they were a widely-transmitted source of Yorkshire stereotypes. Individuals who played a role in the construction of Yorkshireness include the writer James Burnley, the folklorist and humorist Richard Blakeborough, the novelists Halliwell Sutcliffe and William Riley, the dialect writers Charles Rogers and John Hartley, the cartoonist Arthur North and the University of Leeds academic Professor Frederic Moorman, who conceived the project for eisteddfod equivalents in Yorkshire. The conclusion is that Victorian and Edwardian print media and illustrated ephemera were used extensively to construct and convey a sense of Yorkshireness, acting as a countervailing force to the tendency towards nationalisation of culture, and that in the absence of a fully negotiated concept of universal Englishness, county identity was an important factor at home and overseas.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThis thesis critically examines the strict regulations of Chicana feminist theory and the constraints that it places on its followers/participants, preventing them from embracing a holistic identity. In addition to exposing these limitations, I explore possible solutions to overcoming these barriers. As recent research indicates, most Chicana feminist theory is based on nationalistic presuppositions, which require constructing an identity dependent on essentialist notions. Chicana feminist theory empowers Chicanas (in the beginning) because it helps Chicanas re-claim a heritage, language, and culture that is often stereotyped or devalued in mainstream society. Yet the step after this reclaiming can be problematic, for after a woman is a "Chicana," all other identities become <b>sub-identities.</b> Chicana feminist theory must move beyond claiming a voice, language, culture, and ethnic pride. Through this thesis, I propose a theory of love, which will facilitate Chicana feminism's expansion into a more inclusive theory...|$|R

After decades of suppression of traditional industries, a degree of revival was encouraged in the 1950 s and 1960 s under the rubric of “Folk Art. ” Today, although the types of usage do not differ substantially from the Soviet period, traditional textile designs are important symbols of “Our Art” and of a separate central Asian identity within the newly established republics of central Asia...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} British Jewish identity between 1945 and 1960 {{through the}} medium of Jewish youth movements. It argues that youth movements are key sites for the formation and transmission of communal identities into subsequent generations. It entails institutional studies of three Jewish youth organisations: the Jewish Lads’ Brigade, the Victoria Boys’ and Girls’ Club, and the Maccabi Union and is divided accordingly, with chapters devoted to each. The thesis examines the preferred identities that each club sought to impose on their members, using these identities as case studies for the wider British Jewish community. Each chapter addresses issues of national identity, gender, sexuality, faith, ethnicity, Jewish heritage and culture, Zionism, popular music and youth behaviour in order to construct an image of the manner in which various sections of British Jewry perceived their sense of identity. The results of the thesis demonstrate that British Jewish identity was fragmented and heterogeneous, with various sections of the community interpreting the over-arching communal identity {{in a number of different}} and at times contested ways. These interpretations were liminal in nature, existing at the boundaries of a variety of <b>sub-identities,</b> and drew on themes that were specific to both British Jews and to wider non-Jewish society, demonstrating that British Jews saw no distinction between the ‘British’ and ‘Jewish’ aspects of their identities. Such interpretations were highly dynamic and continued to evolve in the face of developing circumstances, both within and outside of British Jewry. In exploring the differing communal identities on offer within British Jewry, the thesis also charts the emergence and priorities of a new communal elite and suggests that it is more precise to speak of multiple British Jewish identities and communities than of a single communal bloc...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{disintegration}} of the Yugoslav state was accompanied by social constructs {{in regard to the}} Other. Stereotypes, prejudices and stigmas, which had existed during the socialist period, were multiplied during the transitional and especially during the war period. The symbolic imagery was especially burdened by national/nationalist constructions of the reality in the former Yugoslav socio-political area, including in Croatia. In this context, national identity was forcefully activated, as a replacement for socialist ideology. Favourising ethno-national identity over all other <b>sub-identities</b> in the socio-political and symbolic area, and the prevalence of an ethnic model of the nation, suppressed democratic processes, and an authoritative national state came into effect on the public scene. A cultural and socio-psychological atmosphere was created that was conducive to the activation of ethnic/national stereotypes, prejudices, and subsequently to the stigmatisation of Others. In Croatia, images of “ustaše” and “chetniks” were activated in the symbolic and practical-political sphere, which only increased the mutual stigmatisation of Croats and Serbs. Various protagonists during the war conflicts activated symbolic images for their own (often very different) goals, and the extent of misuse of national contents depended on the legitimacy or non-legitimacy of political goals, {{as well as on the}} behaviour of political and military organisations and of individuals towards Others in given situations. The author’s empirical research, conducted in West and East Slavonia, Banija and Dalmatia among populations of indigenous Croats and Serbs and immigrants, indicates that the stigmatisation of the nationally Other is still largely present in the post-war period. It gained intensity during the war and reached a maximum in the post-war period. All this aggravates the (re) construction of local communities in former war areas. The gradual decontamination of the socio-psychological atmosphere implies a move away from war “images” and from the notion of an ethnically pure state, and a shift towards multiethnic coexistence and a more tolerant atmosphere for communication...|$|R

Research questions included: • What are the key landmarks in teacher educators’ professional and academic development? • How effective are living graphs as a methodological tool to illuminate teacher educators’ experiences and development? There is increasing interest internationally in the re-conceptualisation of the role of teacher educators and in particular, their developing research identities (Korthagen et al., 2005; Swennen et al., 2010). Several researchers (e. g. Harrison and McKeon, 2010; Murray, 2008) highlight the dual transition that teacher educators make into university life and lack of induction into new roles. Swennen et al. (2010) identify four main roles or <b>sub-identities</b> which teacher educators may adopt, but these may differ across country contexts. They argue that teacher educators often have to transform themselves in order to take on certain identities, especially the researcher role. The overarching theoretical framework used in the study is socio-cultural learning, in recognition that the specific contexts in which teacher educators work are of vital importance in the process of learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991). Eraut’s (2007) research on contextual and learning factors in the workplace is used to identify key factors affecting teacher educators’ professional learning and differences between contexts. Lave and Wenger's (1991) model of legitimate peripheral participation was useful for studying teacher educators' development over time. Visual research methods are a rapidly developing area of social enquiry and an evolving visual culture in research (Bagnoli, 2009; Iantaffi, 2011). The use of living graphs as a research method alongside qualitative interviews was adapted from a strategy often used in history teaching (Dawson, undated). A graph was created using a timeline as a horizontal axis and perceived highs and lows of research identity and professional development as the vertical axis. Participants were asked to map their personal biographies, academic and research highs and lows, career landmarks and barriers and successes using this graphic format. An embedded case study approach (Cohen et al., 2007; Yin, 2002) was used with purposive sampling to identify six mid-career teacher educators in each university. The teacher educators ranged from those in early academic careers to more experienced, and included male and female participants. Narrative analysis was used to examine teacher educators’ own accounts of these perspectives and themes were identified which related to professional/academic identity and development. Interviews were coded and cross-checked across the two universities. The living graphs were analysed alongside the interviews to see if narrative accounts matched or differed. They were also analysed in their own right to identify any similar or differing patterns between and within country contexts and in terms of teacher educators’ gender and experience. Clear landmarks were identified in both contexts, with development in teaching seen as largely positive, while research development was much more varied. Teacher educators who were further on in their careers saw research development as transformative personally as well as academically. In analysing the findings, we drew in particular on Swennen et al. ’s (2010) identification of teacher educators’ <b>sub-identities.</b> Living graphs were found to be a rich data source to identify and explore landmarks, positive features and barriers to development. Enhanced verbal input resulted from using graphics to represent highs and lows of experience, including the visual representation of emotion. Questions have arisen about the most effective use of the graphs. This is a useful research tool and we argue that it is particularly suitable for researching teacher educators’ identities, but it needs further clarification and guidelines for use. The study makes a useful contribution to research on visual methodologies. The findings also contribute strongly to the growing body of international research on teacher educators’ professional development...|$|R
40|$|In today’s {{competitive}} {{business climate}} organizational identification {{has been the}} espoused solution for many organizations over the last years. A model for deconstructing such identification, the Organizational Identity Dynamics Model suggests that the image and culture of an organization, together constitutes its identity. Understanding an organization’s culture is according to one perspective equal to understanding the entire organization. Another perspective suggests that culture is merely a variable and thereby a tool for controlling the organization. The same discussion goes for {{the image of the}} organization. Can the image be defined as the stakeholders’ general view of the organization, or is it a manageable tool for external use? With this thesis we have investigated the organizational identity at Göteborgs-Posten, one of Sweden’s largest newspapers. Our main focus is on the identity architecture, its building blocks, and their relation to each other. For this we analyze empirical data, taken from interviews from different layers at GP, documents and observations, and compare this material to theoretical approaches within the field. The results of this study are that Dan Kärremans description {{of the nature of the}} news agency, its organizational attributes and structure, can be well applied to the GP case. In line with his framework for defining the culture within this certain setting, we found the administration and the culture to be split between an editorial and a market section. Definitions of culture and brand supplied by Schein and Hatch et al, is adequate for defining and sorting our empirical data in this case. Furthermore, the Organizational Identity Dynamics Model provides a suiting framework for categorizing and understanding the interaction between culture and image, and when combined with the study on news agency identification we are provided with a more satisfactory view of the situation. Our main conclusions from this study are that the identity dynamics model can be well applied to the GP case and help describe how culture and image interacts. We however feel that the specific nature of a news agency, a semi-professional bureaucracy, affect the dynamics within the model and creates two <b>sub-identities.</b> The interaction is illustrated in an extended model presented in our analysis...|$|R
40|$|Competitive {{national}} elections {{can play a}} significant role in the consolidation process of developing and established democracies alike. Nevertheless, if not handled adequately, they have the potential to bring long-existing, existential conflict lines to the surface. This electoral conflict, becoming manifest in election violence, has the potential to shy people off from voting and negatively affect their attitude towards elections and democracy in general. The present study examined the ways in which violent electoral conflict affected the political participation and the personal attitudes towards democracy of ordinary Kenyan citizens. Kenya has experienced violent electoral conflict repeatedly since the re-introduction of competitive elections in 1992 and became one of its prime examples due to the devastating 2008 post-election clashes. In order to answer the research questions, 32 semi-structured interviews with 34 victims of electoral violence coming from four main ‘hotspot areas’ of the 2008 post-election violence as well as four expert interviews were conducted. The study finds that the experience of violent electoral conflict led to diametrically opposed reactions in the behaviour of political participation among respondents. About two-thirds of them indicated a change in their behaviour of political participation. With 33 % of the respondents found to be “participating more”, this group even outnumbers its “participating less” counterpart (30 %). This finding is rather surprising as the experience of electoral violence is usually associated with the tendency to shy off from political participation, not only in Kenya. Based on their attitudinal dispositions towards democracy in general and towards democracy in Kenya more specifically, as well as towards Kenyan elections, politics and politicians, a fourfold typology of Kenyan citizens was developed from the sample. It includes: the voting citizen, the resigned citizen, the passive citizen, and the active citizen. The voting citizen with no further interest in politics or political participation was found to be the most prevalent type of citizen in the sample. Attention needs to be taken towards the resigned citizen, which could, in case of further violent electoral conflict and the continuing marginalization of specific ethnic groups, cause a threat to the stabilization process of Kenya’s democracy. Contributions of this study were in designing a destination identity framework as well as in discovering the identity of the city of Nelson Mandela Bay. Directions for future studies include the possibility to conduct a qualitative study on place identity so as to obtain a more nuanced understanding of <b>sub-identities</b> in the city...|$|R
40|$|The {{contemporary}} view {{of identity}} in entrepreneurship accepts its dynamic nature and its multidimensional structure. Some scholars have illustrated how identity tensions may stimulate identity work in different settings, {{but they do}} not offer a satisfactory understanding of how multiple identities of an entrepreneur interact to promote identity work. One setting where identity work is prolific is in the initial stages of the venture when individuals have recently transitioned into entrepreneurship. However, detailed accounts of the identity struggles of the entrepreneur in this stage has not found favour in the entrepreneurship literature. More specifically, studies investigating identity conflict and coherence of entrepreneurs do not provide a satisfactory understanding of identity work derived from the complexity of the existence of multiple identities. The question therefore arises - How do entrepreneurs engage in identity work in response to identity demands caused by multiple identities? To address this research gap I study entrepreneurs that have recently started a venture in the creative industries. The founding stage is chosen to facilitate the observation of intense identity work, while the creative industries as an extreme setting facilitates our observation of multiple <b>sub-identities</b> of the entrepreneur. Though a two-year qualitative longitudinal study of 15 creative entrepreneurs, I provide new insight into identity work of entrepreneurs in light of multiple identities. Drawing on my analysis of the data, I present three articles. In the first, I examine the process of identity work through a staged model, and propose identity routes and tactics of entrepreneurs as they journey through identity disruption and equilibrium. Here, I recognise the impact of the entrepreneurs’ affects in this process. In the second article, I analyse how conflicts between specific identities of the entrepreneur are normalised by investigating dirty work in the context of entrepreneurship. And finally in article three I offer a more rounded discussion to types of trigger for identity work by examining the impact of self-defined critical incidents on identity work of entrepreneurs. Here I discuss the role of sensemaking in internalising the impacts from these critical incidents and find that a single incident can have multiple impacts. The examination of identity work in light of multiple identities is concluded with a discussion of the contributions of the thesis towards the current gaps in identity work literature as identified by scholars...|$|R
