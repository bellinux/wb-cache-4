50|$|The <b>squash</b> <b>vine</b> <b>borer</b> (Melittia cucurbitae) is a diurnal {{species of}} sesiid moth. It is a pest that attacks wild and {{cultivated}} varieties of squash. The moth is often {{mistaken for a}} bee or wasp because of its movements, and the bright orange hindleg scales. The females typically lay their eggs {{at the base of}} leaf stalks, and the caterpillars develop and feed inside the stalk, eventually killing the leaf. They soon migrate to the main stem, and with enough feeding damage to the stem, the entire plant may die.|$|E

5000|$|Tromboncino (...) , {{also known}} as zucchetta (...) , {{is a type of}} squash most often used as a summer squash. While nearly all summer squash are {{cultivar}}s of Cucurbita pepo, tromboncino is a cultivar of Cucurbita moschata. The vining growth habit, is similar to many winter squashes, but unlike most other summer squash. It is more tolerant to some common summer squash pests, including <b>squash</b> <b>vine</b> <b>borer,</b> squash bugs, and powdery mildew, than the more commonly grown, bushy, C. pepo summer squash cultivars. The plants are slower to start producing than some C. pepo types. The fruit color is usually pale green, fading to beige upon maturity, and it is picked around one foot long for summer squash. It is an heirloom, originally from Liguria, and remains popular throughout Italy and abroad. Tromboncino squash can be left to mature into a winter squash; such is often compared to a watery butternut squash. If left to ripen, the fruits can grow over three feet in length.|$|E

40|$|Third instar hop <b>vine</b> <b>borer</b> (Hydraecia immanis) {{and potato}} stem borer (H. micacea) are new pest species on corn in the Midwest. Early instar larvae feed on small-stemmed grasses, and later instar larvae switch to broad- stemmed hosts to {{complete}} development. In {{order to assess}} potential suitability of various weeds of corn fields, larvae were reared on seven selected broad- leaved plants for 16 - 18 days under greenhouse conditions to determine their feeding behavior and performance. Domestic plants included hop (Humulus lupulus) and potato (Solanum tuberosum); weed species included curly dock (Rumex crisp us), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) and giant ragweed (A. trifida). Larvae of both species survived best on corn, hop, and curly dock. While potato was an excellent host for the potato stem borer H. micacea, survival was poor for the hop <b>vine</b> <b>borer,</b> H. immanis. Red root pigweed, common ragweed, giant ragweed and lambsquarters were poor hosts for both moth species. While the potato stem borer, H. micacea, larvae were able to grow well and gain weight rapidly on several hosts, the hop stem borer, H. immanis, grew well only on hops. Larval feeding behavior and size, as well as plant phenology, stem thickness, and growth form, are all critical determinants {{as to whether or}} not a particular plant species can serve as a final host on which H. immanis and H. micacea can complete development...|$|R

40|$|Hawaii’s {{vegetable}} growers produce several unique {{varieties of}} sweetpotatoes [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. ], including purple fleshed cultivars. Sweetpotato growers in Hawaii {{are unable to}} ship sweetpotatoes to California and the U.

Until recently, growers have been exporting sweetpotatoes to the U. S. mainland using methyl bromide fumigation. Methyl bromide fumigation adversely affects root quality and has become costly. Irradiation treatment is an alternative to chemical fumigation for sweetpotato growers. The main advantage of irradiation as a phytosanitary treatment is that it is broadly effective against arthropod pests (insects and mites) at dose levels that do not cause injury to most types of fresh fruits and vegetables. An irradiation treatment of 400 Gy for sweetpotatoes was published as an Interim Rule in the Federal Register on July, 26 2003 based on a technical report submitted to USDA...|$|R
60|$|In {{a stately}} red house, {{in one of}} the villages of New England, lived the heroine of our story. She had every {{advantage}} of rank and wealth, for her father was a deacon of the church, and owned sheep, and oxen, and exceeding much substance. There was an appearance of respectability and opulence about all the demesnes. The house stood almost concealed amid a forest of apple trees, in spring blushing with blossoms, and in autumn golden with fruit. And near by might be seen the garden, surrounded by a red picket fence, enclosing all sorts of magnificence. There, in autumn, might be seen abundant <b>squash</b> <b>vines,</b> which seemed puzzled for room where to bestow themselves; and bright golden squashes, and full-orbed yellow pumpkins, looking as satisfied as the evening sun when he has just had his face washed in a shower, and is sinking soberly to bed. There were superannuated seed cucumbers, enjoying the pleasures of a contemplative old age; and Indian corn, nicely done up in green silk, with a specimen tassel hanging {{at the end of each}} ear. The beams of the summer sun darted through rows of crimson currants, abounding on bushes by the fence, while a sulky black currant bush sat scowling in one corner, a sort of garden curiosity.|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time autumn has been advancing, and {{is said to}} be a month earlier than usual. We had frosts, {{sufficient}} to kill the bean and <b>squash</b> <b>vines,</b> more than a fortnight ago; but there has since been some of the most delicious Indian-summer weather that I ever experienced,--mild, sweet, perfect days, in which the warm sunshine seemed to embrace the earth and all earth's children with love and tenderness. Generally, however, the bright days have been vexed with winds from the northwest, somewhat too keen and high for comfort. These winds have strewn our avenue with withered leaves, although the trees still retain some density of foliage, which is now imbrowned or otherwise variegated by autumn. Our apples, too, have been falling, falling, falling; and we have picked the fairest of them from the dewy grass, and put them in our store-room and elsewhere. On Thursday, John Flint began to gather those which remained on the trees; and I suppose they will amount to nearly twenty barrels, or perhaps more. As usual when I have anything to sell, apples are very low indeed in price, and will not fetch me more than a dollar a barrel. I have sold my share of the potato-field for twenty dollars and ten bushels of potatoes for my own use. This may suffice for the economical history of our recent life.|$|R

40|$|DAMAGE: Bores in vines, eats {{holes in}} stem near base of runner. Runner wilts. DISTRIBUTION: East of Rocky Mountains. LIFECYCLE: The pupae of squash vine borers overwinter in soil. From early to mid summer when {{cucurbits}} begin to bloom the adult moths appear and lay brown eggs singly {{at the base}} around cucurbit plants or on plants. In about 7 to 14 days larvae emerge and tunnel into plant stems. The entry hole is marked by their frass, which resembles sawdust. For approximately {{two to three weeks}} larvae feed inside stems. At full growth larvae enter soil and spin a cocoon where they will pupate in the spring. THRESHOLDS: Scout plants for frass, at entry holes or on the ground at the base of plants. If frass is found, cut open stems to find larvae. If evidence indicates early feeding by larvae, then more eggs will continue to hatch within a few days and treatment is probably warranted; however, no real thresholds have been developed for squash vine borers. CULTURAL CONTROL: Locate points of injury. Split one side of stem with razor blade or sharp knife and puncture worm. Put a mound of moist dirt around each cut stem to prevent drying and to induce root growth beyond point of injury. To help offset damage by borers, place a mound of dirt about every 5 feet in cucurbit row. This will encourage adventitious root growth and help compensate for borer damage, not prevent attack by borers. ORGANIC/BIOLOGICAL CONTROL: No known organic/biological control for <b>squash</b> <b>vine</b> <b>borer.</b> CHEMICAL CONTROL: For control on Cucurbits (cantaloupes, cucumber, squash, pumpkins, and watermelons) : Treat with a registered insecticide when vines begin to run, apply to bases of plants four times at 7 day intervals. Treat when seedlings emerge. Caution: Honeybees are necessary for good fruit set; insecticides are toxic to bees. Apply in evening when fewer bees are working. Treat flower buds, stems, and vines weekly...|$|E
40|$|Includes Bibliography, Timeline, Figures, Appendices, Aerial Photos, Photographs, Maps. The garden {{plots of}} Eagle Heights Community Gardens stretch for eight acres up a {{hillside}} {{on the west}} side of the University of Wisconsin at Madison's campus. Individual gardeners shape much of the space in this allotment-style community garden: their plots join together into a cohesive landscape. Bent water spigots, flowering Canada thistle, and trailing butternut <b>squash</b> <b>vines</b> fill the Gardens. At the beginning of the growing season you can see all the way up the brown hillside, where debris from last year provides hiding places for multitudes of mice. By the middle of August, masses of vegetation hide gardeners who assiduously tend their plots, weeding and harvesting. Everything is brown again in October, plants slowly dying amidst thriving cool-weather spinach and kale. Residents of Eagle Heights began gardening near their apartments in 1960. They arranged for plowing of a common space that they then filled with personal gardens. The Gardens you can walk through today, however, are not the same as those cultivated years ago. Gardeners continuously modify areas of shared concern by redefining what they hold collectively and therefore what they must manage together. This history of Eagle Heights Community Gardens probes how human beings define collective resources and manage them: a process that depends not only on social beliefs but also on our tangible interactions within a landscape. This is a narrative of how collective responsibilities in the Gardens change through time and how they are affected by cultural beliefs and the tangible work of cultivation. This also is a story of how a group of people navigates the boundaries between individuals and communities, between one physical space and another. Places and communities are always personal: they physically exist, yet we bring our own experiences and interpretations to them. I am, therefore, present in the following history. My argument is that what gardeners hold as common changes with shifts in people?s perceptions of the Gardens: it will be helpful, then, for you to see what place of the Gardens is for me. As I worked on this project, I was slowly drawn into the Gardens of today: participating in the Garden Committee and the decisions it makes; getting to know the people whose invisible labor maintains common spaces; forming friendships with those around me. The Gardens swallowed me, so I will always be present in the following stories: in my descriptions of how I physically experience the Gardens, in the questions I asked of previous gardeners, in what I decide to include and omit. I cannot remove myself and I don't believe that will hinder this history at all...|$|R
5000|$|Squanto {{had arrived}} {{just at the}} time that the {{planters}} were to sow their first crops in the Western Hemisphere. Bradford said that in thitehis regard [...] "Squanto stood them in great stead, showing them both the manner how to set it, and after how to dress and tend it." [...] While it is true that the Plymouth settlers were primarily artisans ("printers, weavers, watchmakers, and carpenters and carpenters with little farming experience") who could use any advice on agriculture, the reference to [...] "the manner how to set it," [...] seems to mean more than simply how to plant the seeds. Indeed, southern New England native planting methods were quite different from northern European methods. First, fields were cleared by burning (conifers especially) or by girdling (especially hardwood trees) to prepare for the following growing season. Thomas Morton observed the native practice of biannual burning of undergrowth, to which he ascribed the characteristic landscape of New England as like English parks with only occasional trees. In planting season instead of plowing furrows for seed overturning a large amount of top soil, the Natives made small mounds of soil by hand or shell tools in which to place the seeds (and when the soil was depleted fish was also added for fertilizer). When the corn sprounted, bean seeds were added to the same mounds so that they stalks could be used for support for the bean runners. <b>Squash</b> <b>vines</b> were trained along the mounds to protect the corn stalk roots and reduce weeds. The combination of the three plants was characteristic of native agriculture with the legumes fixing atmospheric nitrogen for the other plants, the maize providing support and the squash reducing the need to weed. Unlike the English farmers at home, the Natives were willing to plant on hillsides (usually the southern) and tops of hills. What Bradford especially mentioned was how Sqanto showed them how to fertilize exhausted soil: he told them, except they got fish and set with it seed in these old grounds it would come to nothing. And he showed them that in the middle of April they should have store enough fish come up the brook by which they began to build, and taught them how to take it, and where to get other provisions necessary for them. All of which they found true by trial and experience.Edward Winslow made the same point about the value of Indian cultivation methods in a letter to England at the end of the year:We set the last Spring some twentie Acres of Indian Corne, and sowed some six Acres of Barly and Pease; and according to the manner of the Indians, we manured our ground with Herings or rather Shadds, which we have in great abundance, and take with great ease at our doores. Our Corn did prove well, & God be praysed, we had a good increase of Indian-Corne, and our Barly indifferent good, but our Pease were not worth the gathering, for we feared they were too late sowne." [...] The method shown by Squanto became the regular practice of the settlers.|$|R
50|$|Straightneck squash (one {{of several}} {{cultivated}} Cucurbita pepo) {{is a type}} of summer squash that is usually yellow-colored. It is also known as yellow summer squash, though that nomenclature is not wholly accurate. The crookneck squash looks similar but has a crooked neck. It has mildly sweet and watery flesh, and thin tender skins that can be left on the fruit for many types of recipes. It was almost certainly domesticated in the eastern United States, although other variants of the same species (zucchini and pumpkin) were domesticated in Mesoamerica. This <b>squash</b> grows on <b>vined</b> plants reaching 60-90 cm in height that thrive in mild weather. It is well known as an item in American cooking where it is fried, microwaved, steamed, boiled, or baked. It is often used in recipes interchangeably with zucchini. A good yellow summer squash will be small and firm with tender skin free of blemishes and bruising. It is available all year long in some regions, but is at its peak from early through late summer. One similar inedible C. pepo variety is C. pepo var. ovifera.|$|R
