Under this program, federal habeas corpus for condemned prisoners would be decided in about three years from affirmance of the sentence on state collateral review. In 2006, Congress conferred the determination of whether a state fulfilled the requirements to the U.S. attorney general, with a possible appeal {{of the state to}} the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. As of March 2016, the Department of Justice has still not granted any certifications.|$|E

Changes made to {{the building}} to comply with modern building codes and standards also had to be easily distinguishable from the original. Among the restoration work required by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office was a large painted sign on the western facade of the building, which overlooks downtown Kent. It was painted in the same location as the previous versions of the sign, which had been visible, though no longer maintained, up until the bricks were cleaned during the building's renovation in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Scotland {{conforms}} to the Human Tissue Authority Code of Practice, which grants authority to donate organs, instead of consent of the individual. This helps to avoid conflict of implications and contains <b>several</b> <b>requirements.</b> In order to participate in organ donation, one must be listed on the Organ Donor Registry (ODR). If the subject is incapable of providing consent, and {{is not on the}} ODR, then an acting representative, such as a legal guardian or family member can give legal consent for organ donation of the subject, along with a presiding witness, according to the Human Tissue Authority Code of Practice. Consent or refusal from a spouse, family member, or relative is necessary for a subject is incapable.|$|E

2500|$|Maxwell's {{original}} {{explanation for}} displacement current focused upon {{the situation that}} occurs in dielectric media. In the modern post-aether era, the concept has been extended to apply to situations with no material media present, for example, to the vacuum between the plates of a charging vacuum capacitor. The displacement current is justified today because it serves <b>several</b> <b>requirements</b> of an electromagnetic theory: [...] correct prediction of magnetic fields in regions where no free current flows; prediction of wave propagation of electromagnetic fields; and conservation of electric charge in cases where charge density is time-varying. For greater discussion see Displacement current.|$|E
2500|$|James' {{instructions}} included <b>several</b> <b>requirements</b> {{that kept}} the new translation familiar to its listeners and readers. The text of the Bishops' Bible would serve as the primary guide for the translators, and the familiar proper names of the biblical characters would all be retained. If the Bishops' Bible was deemed problematic in any situation, the translators were permitted to consult other translations from a pre-approved list: the Tyndale Bible, the Coverdale Bible, Matthew's Bible, the Great Bible, and the Geneva Bible. In addition, later scholars have detected an influence on the Authorized Version from the translations of Taverner's Bible and the New Testament of the Douay–Rheims Bible. It {{is for this reason}} that the flyleaf of most printings of the Authorized Version observes that the text had been [...] "translated out of the original tongues, and with the former translations diligently compared and revised, by His Majesty's special commandment." [...] As the work proceeded, more detailed rules were adopted as to how variant and uncertain readings in the Hebrew and Greek source texts should be indicated, including the requirement that words supplied in English to 'complete the meaning' of the originals should be printed in a different type face.|$|E

Service compositions are built by combining loosely coupled services that are, usually, offered and operated by different service providers. While this approach offers several benefits, it makes the implementation and representation of the security requirements difficult. This paper reviews <b>several</b> <b>requirement</b> specification languages and analyses their suitability for composite services.
