40|$|In the AISI Specification for the Design of Cold-formed Steel Structural Members 2007, {{there are}} two types of <b>shear</b> planes used to {{determine}} the resistance of a bolted connection to block <b>shear</b> failure. When the block <b>shear</b> failure occurs by <b>shear</b> yielding and tensile rupture, the <b>shear</b> failure plane is taken to be the gross <b>shear</b> plane. Conversely, when the block <b>shear</b> failure is deemed to occur by simultaneous <b>shear</b> and tensile ruptures, the <b>shear</b> failure plane is assumed to be the net <b>shear</b> plane. Such an approach is not logical since the <b>shear</b> failure planes should be unique irrespective of the block <b>shear</b> failure mechanism. Through finite element analysis presented in this paper, the <b>shear</b> failure plane is shown to be neither the gross nor the net <b>shear</b> plane, and to be midway between the two <b>shear</b> planes assumed in design specifications. This <b>shear</b> failure plane is termed the active <b>shear</b> plane. The veracity of the active <b>shear</b> area is demonstrated in terms of the ability of the resulting block <b>shear</b> equation to predict the governing failure modes of test specimens consistently, in comparison against the equations assuming the gross and the net <b>shear</b> areas...|$|R

5|$|The finger {{bones of}} bats {{are much more}} {{flexible}} than those of other mammals, owing to their flattened cross-section and to low levels of minerals, such as calcium, near their tips. The elongation of bat digits, a key feature required for wing development, {{is due to the}} upregulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps). During embryonic development, the gene controlling Bmp signaling, Bmp2, is subjected to increased expression in bat forelimbs—resulting in the extension of the manual digits. This crucial genetic alteration helps create the specialized limbs required for volant locomotion. The relative proportion of extant bat forelimb digits compared with those of Eocene fossil bats have no significant differences in relative digit proportion, suggesting that bat wing morphology has been conserved for over 50 million years. During flight, the bones take on bending and <b>shearing</b> stress; and the bending stresses felt are smaller than terrestrial mammals, however the <b>shearing</b> stress is larger. The wing bones of bats have a slightly lower breaking stress point than those of birds.|$|E
40|$|<b>Shear</b> {{strength}} {{is an important}} soil parameter. Many geotechnical failures {{have been caused by}} inadequate <b>shear</b> strength. In order to obtain a high strength modelling silty clay for use in centrifuge model tests of soil-pipeline interaction, direct <b>shear</b> tests, <b>shear</b> vane tests and cone penetration tests were conducted to investigate its <b>shear</b> strength behaviour. [...] This thesis first presents some background on the <b>shear</b> strength of soils and measurement techniques. The details of the direct <b>shear</b> tests, the <b>shear</b> vane tests, the cone penetration tests and centrifuge modelling are also discussed. The silty clays used in this study were kaolin and a kaolin-silt mixture; the plasticity indices were 30. 6 % and 19. 5 % respectively. The kaolin-silt mixture (K-S) was obtained by mixing equal amounts of kaolin and silt by weight. [...] Direct <b>shear</b> and <b>shear</b> vane tests were conducted on both clays at different vertical stresses under various overconsolidation ratios (OCR's). This thesis presents these test procedures and the test results. Cone penetration tests were also conducted in a centrifuge at 50 gravities to verify the results from the direct <b>shear</b> and <b>shear</b> vane tests and to correlate the cone penetration resistance to the undrained <b>shear</b> strength from <b>shear</b> vane and direct <b>shear</b> tests. Centrifuge modelling principles and the current methods to convert cone tip resistance to <b>shear</b> strength are also presented. Test results show that the <b>shear</b> strength of K-S is higher than that of pure kaolin. <b>Shear</b> strengths of heavily overconsolidated clays obtained from the <b>shear</b> vane tests are higher than those obtained from the direct <b>shear</b> tests. A correlation between cone tip resistance and undrained <b>shear</b> {{strength is}} presented. The <b>shear</b> strength of K-S interpreted from CPT results was found to lie between the direct <b>shear</b> and <b>shear</b> vane test results and shows a good correlation in the measurement of <b>shear</b> strength...|$|R

40|$|The exact {{effect that}} each of the basic <b>shear</b> design {{parameters}} exerts on the <b>shear</b> capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) beams without <b>shear</b> reinforcement (Vc) is still unclear. Previous research on this subject often yielded contradictory results, especially for reinforced high-strength concrete (HSC) beams. Furthermore, by simply adding Vc and the contribution of stirrups Vs to calculate the ultimate <b>shear</b> capacity Vu, current <b>shear</b> design practice assumes that the addition of stirrups does not alter the effect of <b>shear</b> design parameters on Vc. This paper investigates the validity of such a practice. Data on 656 reinforced concrete beams were used to train an artificial neural network model to predict the <b>shear</b> capacity of reinforced concrete beams and evaluate the performance of several existing <b>shear</b> strength calculation procedures. A parametric study revealed that the effect of <b>shear</b> reinforcement on the <b>shear</b> strength of RC beams decreases at a higher reinforcement ratio. It was also observed that the concrete contribution to <b>shear</b> resistance, Vc, in RC beams with <b>shear</b> reinforcement is noticeably larger than that in beams without <b>shear</b> reinforcement, and therefore most current <b>shear</b> design procedures provide conservative predictions for the <b>shear</b> strength of RC beams with <b>shear</b> reinforcement...|$|R

40|$|<b>Shear</b> {{viscosity}} {{is used as}} a parameter {{that characterizes}} the energy dissipation rate under <b>shear</b> loading. For instance, <b>shear</b> viscosity for Newtonian fluid is an intrinsic material parameter and independent of <b>shear</b> rate. Through the method of suspending small particles inside of the Newtonian fluid, particle concentration is formed and exhibits a number of rheological phenomena, for instance, <b>shear</b> thinning, <b>shear</b> thickening, thixotropy, yielding, and <b>shear</b> induced aggregation. In some occasions, the energy dissipation rate decreases with the increasing <b>shear</b> rate, which means decreased <b>shear</b> viscosity and corresponding <b>shear</b> stress increases below linearity with the respect to <b>shear</b> rate, it is defined as <b>shear</b> thinning. To {{the other end of the}} spectrum, another type of non-Newtonian behavior, in which a steep rise in <b>shear</b> viscosity is observed and corresponding <b>shear</b> stress increases faster than linearity with respect to <b>shear</b> rate, it is defined as <b>Shear</b> Thickening (ST). Although this counter intuitive phenomenon of ST was initially viewed as a problem, for instance, complicating and limiting the rate of industrial processes which involved combination of high <b>shear</b> rates and highly concentrated suspensions such as paper coating and pumping of slurries, the unique material properties, such as increased energy dissipation together with increased elastic modulus, make the <b>shear</b> thickening materials very favorable candidates for damping and shock absorption applications. Consequently, engineers and colloid scientists have endeavored to study the science and practical problems of the <b>shear</b> thickening materials. More recently, it is widely proposed that when engineered into composite materials, <b>Shear</b> Thickening Fluids (STFs) can be controlled and harnessed, and thus triggers the development of large number of novel fluids or elastomer materials featuring <b>shear</b> thickening, which in turn broaden the horizon of <b>shear</b> thickening study, and the application of the <b>shear</b> thickening phenomenon is greatly widened as a result...|$|R

Foreword Mudslide is a common geological disaster. China, with complex geological environment and concentrate precipitation, which result into frequent mudslide, suffers a great threaten to its people's lives and property safety. Mudslide, in essence, is the soil <b>shear</b> failure. Soil <b>shear</b> failure forms a failure surface, then the surface extended into a mudslide. Soil <b>shear</b> strength is the soil capability to resist the <b>shear</b> under a certain stress condition, which {{is equal to the}} soil <b>shear</b> stress when soil <b>shear</b> failure occurs on value. Soil <b>shear</b> strength constitutes by the soil internal friction and the cohesion. When the mudslide hidden point take a rainfall, soil moisture content raises, the internal friction and the cohesion reduce, lead to the weakness of the <b>shear</b> strength. When the <b>shear</b> stress equals to the <b>shear</b> strength, the <b>shear</b> failure occurs.

In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles.

50|$|Clearly the {{determinant}} {{will always}} be 1, as no matter where the <b>shear</b> element is placed, {{it will be a}} member of a skew-diagonal that also contains zero elements (as all skew-diagonals have length at least two) hence its product will remain zero and won't contribute to the determinant. Thus every <b>shear</b> matrix has an inverse, and the inverse is simply a <b>shear</b> matrix with the <b>shear</b> element negated, representing a <b>shear</b> transformation in the opposite direction. In fact, this is part of an easily derived more general result: if S is a <b>shear</b> matrix with <b>shear</b> element , then Sn is a <b>shear</b> matrix whose <b>shear</b> element is simply n. Hence, raising a <b>shear</b> matrix to a power n multiplies its <b>shear</b> factor by n.|$|R

40|$|We perform {{extensive}} {{molecular dynamics}} simulations of 2 D frictionless granular materials {{to determine whether}} these systems can be characterized by a single static yield <b>shear</b> stress. We consider boundary-driven planar <b>shear</b> at constant volume and either constant <b>shear</b> force or constant <b>shear</b> velocity. Under steady flow conditions, these two ensembles give similar results for the average <b>shear</b> stress versus <b>shear</b> velocity. However, near jamming {{it is possible that}} the <b>shear</b> stress required to initiate <b>shear</b> flow can differ substantially from the <b>shear</b> stress required to maintain flow. We perform several measurements of the <b>shear</b> stress near the initiation and cessation of flow. At fixed <b>shear</b> velocity, we measure the average <b>shear</b> stress Σ_yv in the limit of zero <b>shear</b> velocity. At fixed <b>shear</b> force, we measure the minimum <b>shear</b> stress Σ_yf required to maintain steady flow at long times. We find that in finite-size systems Σ_yf > Σ_yv, which implies that there is a jump discontinuity in the <b>shear</b> velocity from zero to a finite value when these systems begin flowing at constant <b>shear</b> force. However, our simulations show that the difference Σ_yf - Σ_yv, and thus the discontinuity in the <b>shear</b> velocity, tend to zero in the infinite system size limit. Thus, our results indicate that in the large system limit, frictionless granular systems are characterized by a single static yield <b>shear</b> stress. We also monitor the short-time response of these systems to applied <b>shear</b> and show that the packing fraction of the system and shape of the velocity profile can strongly influence whether or not the <b>shear</b> stress at short times overshoots the long-time average value.

5|$|The tip of {{the upper}} jaw is beak-like and {{separated}} from {{the remainder of the}} jaw by a notch. There is a single row of teeth in the lower jaw and a double row in the upper, with the bottom row fitting perfectly between the two upper rows when the mouth is closed. This specific tooth arrangement is not seen in any other reptile; although most snakes have a double row of teeth in their upper jaws, their arrangement and function is different from the tuatara's. The jaws, joined by ligament, chew with backwards and forwards movements combined with a <b>shearing</b> up and down action. The force of the bite is suitable for <b>shearing</b> chitin and bone. Fossils indicate that this jaw structure began developing about 180 million years ago. The tuatara's teeth are not replaced, since they are not separate structures like real teeth, but sharp projections of the jaw bone. As their teeth wear down, older tuatara have to switch to softer prey such as earthworms, larvae, and slugs, and eventually have to chew their food between smooth jaw bones. The brain of Sphenodon fills only half of the volume of its endocranium. This proportion has actually been used by paleontologists trying to estimate the volume of dinosaur brains based on fossils. However, the proportion of the tuatara endocranium occupied by its brain may not be a very good guide to the same proportion in Mesozoic dinosaurs since modern birds are surviving dinosaurs but have brains which occupy a much greater relative volume within the endocranium.|$|E
