5|$|The First of the Few (also {{known as}} Spitfire in the US and Canada) (1942) was a British film {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Leslie Howard, with Howard in the starring role of R.J. Mitchell, and David Niven playing a composite character based on the Schneider Trophy pilots of 1927, 1929 and 1931, and the Supermarine test pilot Jeffrey Quill. Some of the footage includes film shot in 1941 of operational Spitfires and pilots of 501 Squadron (code letters SD). Howard <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> researching {{the history of the}} Spitfire's development for the film; Mrs. Mitchell and her son Gordon were on the set during much of the production. The aerobatic flying sequences featured in the last 15 minutes of the film were made by Jeffrey Quill in early November 1941, flying a Spitfire Mk II mocked up to represent the prototype.|$|E

500|$|After Bateman {{signed on}} to direct the film, he and Dodge <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> {{revising}} the script, particularly adjusting parts where the dark humor [...] "went {{a little bit too}} far".

5000|$|Yosef Baraki {{has stated}} that he was {{inspired}} to write the film after meeting {{with a group of}} child street sellers in Kabul.

May was educated at home by her mother and governess (as were her brothers until they were sent to boarding schools).

500|$|An early {{draft of}} the episode {{originally}} featured an Opera house explosion, which was changed because the writers felt using a dam would be more exciting. An early rule of Sideshow Bob episodes was to recap what had gone on in previous Bob episodes, in case the viewer had forgotten who he was. The original script was run by the Frasier producers {{to make sure they}} were okay with it, and they only had one problem. There was a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character and refers to her as [...] "Maris", who in Frasier is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier said the scene should go. The writers <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> trying to figure out a civilization that considered chief hydrological engineer a true calling and chose the Cappadocians, who were famous for underground cities although not specifically dams.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Stoneman {{published}} Chavez: The Revolution Will Not Be Televised – A Case Study of Politics and the Media. A book [...] "of film studies {{rather than}} politics", it nevertheless looks in detail at the petition's arguments. Stoneman [...] "broadly absolves" [...] the filmmakers; he concludes, [...] "There were some relatively small examples of slippage in the grammar of the piece, but overall {{the film was}} made with honesty and integrity. Of the 18 objections made, 15, if not 17, were wrong. The filmmakers <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> assembling evidence to show why they'd done what they'd done in the film and mostly it's true." [...] Stoneman conceded that the filmmakers' cinéma vérité approach meant that for wider historical and political context, viewers should look elsewhere. Stoneman received an [...] "Executive Producer" [...] credit on the film, which he explains as an unasked-for gratuity that came {{by virtue of his}} position as head of BSÉ.|$|E
500|$|The team {{wanted to}} make the game as {{consistently}} realistic as possible, wishing to avoid the situation of realistic character models standing in front of low-resolution backgrounds. They created varying degrees of technical advancement for different locations: the most realistic location they created was the Detroit hub, while the most advanced was the two-level fictional metropolis of Hengsha. Architecture in the Detroit area was inspired by then-modern buildings from Japan and Europe. Jacques-Belletête <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> researching furniture designs while creating interiors for in-game environments, joking that they could fill an IKEA catalogue with the results. Multiple other hub locations were planned, including the upper levels of Hengsha, and an area of Montreal dubbed [...] "Plateau" [...] that featured [...] "very specific architecture, called tri-plexes, with twirling exterior staircases made of [...] old metal". At the beginning of production, there were even plans to feature a hub location in India. When it became clear how much work it would be, the team cut out what could not be managed. Upper Hengsha was built but never finished before being scrapped.|$|E
50|$|Afterwards, Golden {{continued}} her amateur career in Canada and pitched for the Montreal Royals in 1943, {{before returning to}} the Toronto Nationals for the next five seasons. She then went into hospital for surgery on her back. As <b>a</b> result, she <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period of <b>time</b> recovering and opted to retire from playing the game at a competitive level. She completed a 22-year career and did play at least one exhibition game in 1950 to raise money for injured players.|$|R
2500|$|I {{remember}} Jimmy had {{a little}} bit of trouble with the solo on [...] "Stairway to Heaven"... e hadn't completely figured it out. Nowadays you sometimes spend a whole day doing one thing. Back then, we never did that. We never <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> very <b>long</b> <b>time</b> recording anything.

I could see he was getting a bit paranoid and so I was getting paranoid. I turned around and said [...] "You're making me paranoid!" [...] And he said, [...] "No, you're making me paranoid!" [...] It was a silly circle of paranoia. Then bang! On the next take or two he ripped it out.|$|R
40|$|I want {{to start}} this {{presentation}} with the case study of a "social studies" teacher who was very bored with his teaching job. He was not challenged any more and he thought that his students were incapable of analyzing and evaluating the important and critical episodes in world history. He thought that one solution to this dilemma would be to write exam questions that required his students to engage in critical and upper level thinking. He <b>spent</b> quite <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> writing such <b>an</b> exam and was happy about his accomplishment. However, after he administered the exam, more than 90 % of the students could not answer the questions he had designed. After some deliberation {{he came to the}} conclusion that he was not teaching for thinking. In other words: "He was testing for something that he did not teach. "...|$|R
500|$|In March 2005, Radiohead {{began writing}} and {{recording}} new music in their Oxfordshire studio. In {{an effort to}} [...] "get out of the comfort zone", they decided against involving producer Nigel Godrich, with whom they had recorded five albums. At the Ether Festival in July 2005, Greenwood and Yorke performed {{a version of the}} future In Rainbows track [...] "Weird Fishes/Arpeggi" [...] with the London Sinfonietta orchestra and the Arab Orchestra of Nazareth. Regular recording sessions began in August 2005, with the band updating fans on their progress intermittently on their new blog, [...] The sessions were slow, and the band struggled to regain confidence; according to Yorke, [...] "we <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> in the studio just not going anywhere, wasting our time, and that was really, really frustrating." [...] Guitarist Ed O'Brien said the band considered splitting up, but kept working [...] "because when you got beyond all the shit and the bollocks, the core of these songs were really good." [...] They attributed their slow progress to a lack of momentum after their break and the lack of deadline and producer.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of the English Civil War, the Court of Chancery was being criticised {{extensively}} for its procedure and practice. During the 16th century the Court was vastly overworked; Francis Bacon wrote of 2,000 orders being made a year, while Sir Edward Coke estimated the backlog to be around 16,000 cases. This was partly due to the incompetence of the judges, and partially due to the procedure used; evidence was re-heard up to three times and orders were issued and then over-ruled, only to be issued again: [...] "what was ordered one day was contradicted the next, so as in some cases there had been five hundred orders and faire more as some affirmed". The Court <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> on each case, which, combined with the backlog, made the pursuit of a case extremely expensive. This was exacerbated by the appointment to the Court of useless, highly paid officials by the Lord Chancellor or Master of the Rolls, many of whom were their friends. The Chancellor and Master both openly sold these roles, whose exorbitant pay is more surprising considering that their duties were normally such that could be easily performed by solicitor's clerks, and that they were usually performed by underclerks, not by the officials.|$|E
500|$|Philip and Mary Ann Hobel <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> {{seeking a}} {{distributor}} for Tender Mercies without any success. Duvall, {{who began to}} doubt the film would be widely released, was unable to help the Hobels because he was busy {{trying to find a}} distributor for Angelo My Love, a film he had written, directed and produced. Eventually, Universal Pictures agreed to distribute Tender Mercies. Test screenings for the film were held, which Beresford described as the most unusual he had ever experienced. The director said that the preview audiences appeared to be very engaged with the picture, to the point the theaters were so silent, [...] "if you flicked a piece of paper on the floor, you could hear it fall." [...] However, the post-screening feedback was, in Beresford's words, [...] "absolutely disastrous." [...] As a result, Universal executives lost faith in the film and made little effort to promote it. Foote said of the studio, [...] "I don't know that they disliked the film, I just think they thought it was inconsequential and of no consequence at all. I guess they thought it would just get lost in the shuffle." [...] Others in the film industry were equally dismissive; one Paramount Pictures representative described the picture as [...] "like watching paint dry".|$|E
5000|$|In 1990 he {{attended}} a concert of three tenors, and decided to sing opera as well. He went to Baku for musical education there. He <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> relatively <b>long</b> <b>time</b> managing accommodation and finding a proper school to attend. After two years {{he was able to}} join a preparatory branch of the Baku Musical Academy, vocal class. After he passed the examinations, the rector of the Academy, Mr. Bedelbeyli, allowed him to study free of charge. Then he completed his undergraduate and graduate levels of music school and now lectures at the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre. He has been awarded the position of [...] "People's Artist" [...] in the Republic of Azerbaijan, which is the highest honor given to artists in that country. He has been introduced in [...] "Azerbaijan Temporary Music Ontology" [...] {{as one of the most}} outstanding opera singers in Azerbaijan Republic.|$|R
5000|$|Hirokazu Koreeda had {{drafted and}} revised several screenplays for over 15 years. He also <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> very <b>long</b> <b>time</b> {{getting to know}} his subjects, and wanted the young cast members to interact, grow, and express their personalities freely, with as little adult {{dictation}} as possible. He {{did not use the}} usual structuring and cueing methods, but instead uses a discreet camera to show how children really live when no one is looking. Also, when the director discovered the actress Momoko Shimizu who played Yuki liked Apollo Choco more than Strawberry Pocky as was in the script, he changed his script to suit that and made her smile brighter. He also opted not to make feel-good movie though it is the custom for Japanese films of this type, but instead choose to get rid of anything sentimental and become stoic. This is because he wanted the audience to [...] "take away something" [...] from the film.|$|R
50|$|The {{division}} <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> unusually <b>long</b> <b>time</b> in {{the process}} of forming up. At the end of June it was assigned to 10th Reserve Army, and Col. S.I. Chernyak took command on July 8, a post he would hold until January 12, 1943. Instead of being shipped south {{along with the rest of}} what became the 5th Shock Army, it was moved in August to join 43rd Army, still in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. In September, that Army was assigned to Kalinin Front. The 306th remained in that Army and Front for <b>an</b> unusually <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> During October, 1942 the division, along with several others of its Army, was on notice to prepare to join in the planned second stage of Operation Mars; in the event this did not take place because the first stage was unsuccessful. Following two previous changes in command (including one brief stint by Col. M.I. Kucheryavenko in March, 1943) the divisional command passed to Col. G.M. Kostik on March 27, 1943, and he would remain in this position until April 19, 1944. In September, 1943, the 306th was assigned to the 91st Rifle Corps.|$|R
