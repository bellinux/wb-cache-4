40|$|This {{research}} was initiated to identify methods {{of reducing the}} occurrence of transverse cracking. Eight (four repetitive) research sections were established to study three variations in the asphalt concrete pavement. The first variation was the comparison of low- and high-temperature-susceptible asphalt cement (AC) from two different sources. The second variable was to saw and seal transverse joints at spacings varying from 40 to 100 ft. The third variable was to increase the AC content in the asphalt treated base by 1 percent. The research sections were constructed with relatively few problems. Crack and joint surveys have been conducted on all research sections at intervals of less than 1 year since construction. No cracking was identified after the first winter season. The <b>sawed</b> <b>joints</b> also remained sealed through the first winter. At an age of approximately 1 1 / 2 years there was substantial cracking of the high-temperature-susceptible AC sections and substantial failure of the sealant material in the <b>sawed</b> <b>joints.</b> After almost 4 years, the asphalt pavement constructed with the high-temperature-susceptible AC produced a crack interval of 35 ft, the low-temperature-susceptible AC yielded an interval of 170 ft, and the low-temperature-susceptible AC with an increased AC content yielded an interval of 528 ft. The Pen-Vis number is an effective measure of temperature susceptibility of asphalt cements. The frequency of transverse cracking {{is affected by the}} temperature susceptibility of the AC.

40|$|Early entry sawing applies sawing {{earlier and}} more shallowly than {{conventional}} sawing and {{is believed to}} increase sawing productivity and {{reduce the cost of}} the <b>joint</b> <b>sawing</b> operations. However, some early entry <b>sawing</b> <b>joints</b> (transverse joints) in Iowa were found to experience delayed cracking, sometimes up to 30 days. A concern is whether early entry sawing can lead to late-age random cracking. The present study investigated the effects of different sawing methods on random cracking in portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements. The approach was to assess the cracking potential at <b>sawing</b> <b>joints</b> by measuring the strain development of the concrete at the joints using concrete embedment strain gages. Ten joints were made with the early entry sawing method to a depth of 1. 5 in., and two strain gages were installed in each of the joints. Another ten joints were made with the conventional sawing method, five of which were sawed to a depth of one-third of the pavement thickness (3. 3 in.), and the other five of which were sawed to a depth of one-quarter of the pavement thickness (2. 5 in.). One strain gage was installed in each joint made using conventional sawing. In total, 30 strain gages were installed in 20 joints. The results from the present study indicate that all 30 joints cracked within 25 days after paving, though most joints made using early entry sawing cracked later than the joints made using conventional sawing. No random cracking was observed in the early entry sawing test sections two months after construction. Additionally, {{it was found that the}} strain gages used were capable of monitoring the deformations at the joints.

Both 2 D and 3 D finite element models are developed using the solution of heat transfer equations in ABAQUS Standard implicit.

As compared to the 3 D analysis, the 2 D model significantly reduced the time and cost of the FE computation.

40|$|Experiments {{with early}} entry light sawing of Portland cement {{concrete}} (PCC) contraction joints began in Iowa in 1989. Since that time, changes in early sawing equipment have occurred {{as well as}} changes in specifications for sawing. The option to use early sawing for transverse contraction joints was specified in 1992. A problem happening occasionally with early sawing was the break out {{of some of the}} concrete around the end of the <b>joint</b> as the <b>saw</b> blade approached the edge of the slab. To prevent this, it was proposed that the sawing would terminate approximately 1 / 2 " to 3 / 4 " before the edge of the slab, creating a "short joint". This procedure would also leave a concrete "dam" to prevent the run-out and waste of the hot liquid joint sealant onto the shoulder. It would also eliminate the need for the labor and material for applying a duct tape dam at the open ends of each <b>sawed</b> <b>joint</b> to stop hot liquid sealant run-out Agreements were made with the contractor to apply the "short joint" technique for 1 day of paving. The evaluation and results are compared with an adjoining control section. The research found no negative aspects from sawing the "short joint". Three specific findings were noted. They are the following: 1) No joint end "blow-out" spalls of concrete occurred. 2) The need for the duct tape dam to stop liquid sealant overflow was eliminated. 3) Joint end corner spalls appear to be caused mainly by construction shouldering operations equipment. The "short joint" sawing technique can be routinely applied to early entry <b>sawed</b> transverse contraction <b>joints</b> with expectations of only positive results...|$|R

The microstructural examination of these simulated specimens shows the presence of the local brittle zones (LBZ) in the CGHAZ in spite of the steel was Ti-microalloyed.

40|$|In {{conventional}} construction practices, {{a longitudinal}} <b>joint</b> is <b>sawed</b> in a PCC (Portland Cement Concrete) pavement to control concrete shrinkage cracking between two lanes of traffic. <b>Sawing</b> a <b>joint</b> in hardened concrete {{is an expensive}} and time consuming operation. The longitudinal joint is not a working joint (in comparison to a transverse joint) as it is typically tied with a tie bar at 30 inch spacing. The open joint reservoir, left by the saw blade, typically is filled or sealed with a durable crack sealant to keep incompressibles and water from getting into the joint reservoir. An experimental joint forming knife has been developed. It is installed under the paving machine to form the longitudinal joint in the wet concrete {{as a part of}} the paving process. Through this research method, forming a very narrow longitudinal joint during the paving process, two conventional paving operations can be eliminated. Joint forming eliminates the need of the <b>joint</b> <b>sawing</b> operation in the hard concrete, and as the joint that is formed does not leave a wide-open reservoir, but only a hairline crack, it does not need the joint filling or sealing operation. Therefore, the two conventional longitudinal <b>joint</b> <b>sawing</b> and sealing operations are both being eliminated by this innovation. A laboratory scale prototype joint forming knife was built and tested, initially forming joints in small concrete beams. The results were positive so the method was proposed for field testing. Initial field tests were done in the construction season of 2001, limited to one paving contractor. A number of modifications were made to the knife throughout the field tests.

40|$|The CTOD {{toughness}} {{evaluation of}} repaired weld joints (given two weld deposits, complex mechanical heterogeneity and high residual stresses) requires modification of commonly used specimen geometry and testing procedure. This paper {{presents the results}} of the SENB specimens with shallow (a/W= 0. 16) and deep notches (a/W= 0. 5) extracted from 30 mm thick multipass submerged arc welded (<b>SAW)</b> <b>joints</b> which were repaired with hyperbaric (16 bar) welding process at the toe region of the original SAW weld deposit. The results of this study show that the CTOD (#delta#_ 5) measurements are consistent with the calculated CTOD values according to the BS 5762 standard for both deep and shallow cracked specimens (a/W= 0. 16) if the plastic rotation factor (r_p) value of 0. 25 is used in the latter. The problem of selection of yield stress for calculation of the CTOD according to the BS 5762 standard for highly heterogeneous repaired weld joints can be eliminated using the CTOD (#delta#_ 5) technique. It is important to realise that the through thickness deep and shallow notched specimens can produce lower bound toughness values if the notch accurately samples the local brittle zones. The later produced its lower bound values under the influence of overmatching hyperbaric repair weld joint despite its lower crack tip constraint. Surface notched specimens (a/W= 0. 4) where the very crack tip is controlled by one microstructure did not give lower bound thoughness values. (orig.)
