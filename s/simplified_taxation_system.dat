Banks, insurers, foreign companies and certain other professions and businesses are not eligible. The average number of employees in the firm should not exceed 100 during the year and total assets should not exceed 100,000,000 roubles to be eligible. Unified tax is levied either on gross receipts at 6 percent, or on profit before income tax at 15 percent; the choice of either option, is made by the taxpayer.

40|$|With {{the move}} {{to a market economy}} the number of small {{businesses}} has grown substantially in most transition countries. However, cumbersome legal provisions and administrative practices and the lack of a culture of voluntary compliance often provide strong incentives to operate outside the formal economy. The paper first discusses the growth of the SME sector in the region and its impact on tax policy and tax administration. It then describes approaches chosen by different countries in the region to reduce the tax burden and compliance costs for SMEs. It shows that the design of a clear and reasonably fair simplified tax system is a task which often has been underestimated by Ministries of Finance and tax administrations. As a consequence, <b>simplified</b> <b>taxation</b> <b>systems</b> risk to lack stability and transparency. With a growing and increasingly powerful small business lobby in transition countries policy makers face more and more pressure to further reduce the small business tax burden, risking to broaden the gap between the simplified and the standard tax system and to provide incentives for the use of evasion and avoidance techniques by larger businesses as well as employees.

The system does not allow taxpayers to pass prepaid input VAT to their customers; such customers who are VAT payers are unable to refund any VAT paid downstream. As a result, businesses engaged in B2B transactions prefer general taxation.|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} {{conditions}} of global turbulence regional and municipal authorities should not exclude the economic potential {{of small and}} medium-sized enterprises while planning and forecasting tax revenues of the regional budgets. In this regard, the urgent task consists in the formation of accounting and information database for analyzing and evaluating tax revenues from small and medium enterprises in the Russian regions. The article examines the contribution of certain types of special tax regimes in the formation of tax revenues by the total revenue in the regional budgets. The article consistently investigates tax revenues on the basis of lumpsum taxes (the tax under the simplified system of taxation, single tax on imputed income for certain types of activities, a single agricultural tax, the tax levied in connection {{with the use of the}} patent system of taxation) per capita in terms of 83 subjects of the Russian Federation. On the basis of the obtained results, the author clusters the subjects of the Russian Federation by this indicator. The analysis allowed to identify the leading regions and illustrate regional differentiation. It was empirically determined that the amount of tax revenues depends not only on the share of the population that use special tax regimes, but also on their types. It was found that the <b>simplified</b> <b>taxation</b> <b>system</b> is the most attractive one among all special regimes, while the unified agricultural tax remains less promising from the fiscal point of view in a number of regions.

The testimony to this are world researches according to which pharmaceutical industry possesses one of the steadiest potentials of functioning in the system of connected branches (clusterization potential). The interbranch character of issues faced by the cluster, forms the number of corresponding problems defining the basic directions of cluster development: 1. In the sphere of innovations and "know-hows" creation. 2. In the sphere of a transfer of innovations and "know-hows". 3. In the sphere of the commodity distribution infrastructure development. 4. In the sphere of interbranch interaction. 5. In the sphere of economic interests and business reputation of the cluster participants protection, safety of consumers. Concerning the subjects of small business of the biopharmaceutical cluster the tax-budgetary policy should assume the realization of the following basic actions. It is necessary: 1) to continue the work on introduction the <b>simplified</b> <b>taxation</b> <b>system</b> {{on the basis of the}} patent in the territory of the Altai Republic; 2) to develop the systems of privileges on taxes for the subjects of small and medium businesses of the biopharmaceutical cluster, within the limits of the operating federal legislation; 3) to generate at the expense of the republican budget the system of preferential financing of the subjects of small and medium businesses of the biopharmaceutical cluster. The basic indicators of the realization of the biopharmaceutical cluster creation of the Altai Republic are: the increase in the content of the regional product and in export of the Republic the share of products of the cluster’s participants, and first of all – finished products, competitive in the Russian and international markets; increase in number of new workplaces within the cluster; the growth of volumes of research and development and innovative activity within the cluster; reduction of the percentage of discrepancy between the number of experts graduated from the primary, secondary and higher professional educational establishments, and the market need in these experts within the cluster; the growth of relative density of goods and services of the subjects of small and medium businesses made and rendered within the cluster by means of outsourcing and subcontracting mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis (GFC) has brought unprecedented {{challenges to the}} world economy and numerous demands for regulatory improvements of its financial architecture. China has not been immune from these challenges. Their impact upon its domestic economy has been profound. Like many countries that developed broad stimulus packages to combat {{the effects of the}} GFC, China embarked upon various changes and reforms to its <b>taxation</b> <b>system.</b> In the past two years, reforms included structural and targeted tax reductions (corporate taxation and Consumption Tax, CT) and a significant shift to move China’s most important indirect tax (Value Added Tax, VAT) towards a consumption-type system. To what extent are these reforms directly responsive to the effects of the GFC? Using China as a case study, is it possible to propose an effective universal tax response to financial turmoil or economic difficulties generally? Although scholars have argued that, from a tax policy perspective, the conclusion must be that manipulating tax rates as a source of subsidizing finance for distressed business is ill-conceived, does this hold good in China’s case which is now only developing a fully mature tax system and whose recent reforms might best be evaluated as key steps in its long-held desire to <b>simplify</b> its <b>taxation</b> <b>system,</b> move towards a broader tax collection base, lower tax rates and enhance tax collection? This article seeks to answer these questions. It concludes that some targeted tax reforms in economically stressed times can be implemented swiftly and produce immediate and positive benefits. In this regard, particular attention is paid to China’s indirect <b>taxation</b> <b>system,</b> especially the imposition of VAT and CT, since this is critical to its overall tax collections (providing {{more than half of the}} taxation revenue obtained by the Central Government) and which directly impacts upon the consumption of all manner of goods. link_to_OA_fulltextInternational Conference on Globalization and Business Challenges in the post-Financial Crisis World, Prato, Italy, 28 - 29 September 2010.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the European Union, tax {{harmonisation}} has become a key issue throughout Europe. Harmonisation by its nature involves the comparison of the different <b>taxation</b> <b>systems</b> that prevail in Europe. One obstacle to this comparison is the fact that each country describes its <b>taxation</b> <b>system</b> in its own language. Clearly, the translation of terms extracted from <b>taxation</b> <b>systems</b> is essential to mutual comprehension. However, language barriers, although significant, do not represent the only difficulty. <b>Taxation</b> <b>systems</b> in Europe have evolved from two main trends resulting in the Anglo-Saxon and the Latin <b>taxation</b> <b>systems.</b> Both types of system have developed separately over the last 200 years and each is based on different underlying concepts. Despite reform, these generic conceptual differences still apply in addition to the various socio-economic factors which have influenced the development of the <b>taxation</b> <b>systems.</b> Recognition and explanation of these difficulties is of paramount importance. This thesis discusses some of the terminological issues raised by conceptual non-equivalence and highlights ways in which terminology as a discipline is a useful tool in isolating these issues. This discussion occurs {{within the context of a}} comparison of two specific <b>taxation</b> <b>systems</b> (Spanish and Irish) from the perspective of the translation of Spanish terms into English.

50|$|Before {{the reform}} and opening, China {{exercised}} a single <b>taxation</b> <b>system.</b> Because <b>taxation</b> had {{no connection with}} the economic activities of enterprises, this system lacked vitality. In 1981, the Chinese government began to collect income tax from Sino-foreign joint ventures and solely foreign-funded enterprises, taking {{the first step in}} <b>taxation</b> <b>system</b> reform. From 1983 to 1984, the reform consisting of the replacement of profits by taxes was carried out in domestic enterprises, and a foreign-related <b>taxation</b> <b>system</b> was set up. As a result, instead of a single tax category, a compound <b>taxation</b> <b>system</b> in which turnover and income taxes were the mainstay and other tax categories were in coordination with it was initially in place and promoted the control of finances and the economy. In 1994, the reform of the <b>taxation</b> <b>system</b> was deepened, and a complete structural adjustment of the <b>taxation</b> <b>system</b> was made by taking the market economy as the norm. In 1996, China lowered the rate of customs duties and export drawback, and exercised import supervision.|$|R
