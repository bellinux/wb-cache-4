If the attacker tries to get his king to his sixth rank by moving his rook to that rank first to block the checks, the defender simply exchanges rooks and has a drawn king and pawn versus king endgame.|$|E

The pandit of the east will then <b>sum</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> anointment with a similar speech as above, with appropriate replies from the king. The Chief Brahmin will then approach the king and hand him the great royal nine-tiered white umbrella, the symbol of a consecrated king. The king will accept it and hand it over to a royal page. A mantra is then invoked by the Brahmin, to fanfare and music. The king will then rise from the throne and proceed to the crowning.|$|E
25|$|The {{collects}} come at {{the close}} of the office and are short prayers summing up the supplications of the congregation. They arise out of a primitive practice on the part of the bishop (local president), examples of which are found in the Didachē (Teaching of the Apostles) and in the letters of Clement of Rome and Cyprian. With the crystallization of church order improvisation in prayer largely gave place to set forms, and collections of prayers were made which later developed into Sacramentaries and Orationals. The collects of the Breviary are largely drawn from the Gelasian and other Sacramentaries, and they are used to <b>sum</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> dominant idea of the festival in connection with which they happen to be used.|$|E
25|$|After reuniting, {{the party}} finally reaches Alent. Here, Justin meets Liete in person, who reveals {{to him that}} his stone is {{actually}} an ancient artifact forged by the Icarians, a race of powerful sorcerers who lived during the Angelou era, and was {{a gift to the}} humans who lived at the time to use as they pleased to bring prosperity, but when they became corrupted by dark desires, it instead gave birth to Gaia, who nearly destroyed the world. The Icarians sacrificed themselves to save the planet and humanity, and enacted a spell that two of their kind would be born into the world should Gaia ever be revived, destined to also sacrifice themselves to save the world until the next revival in an endless loop. Realizing Feena and Leen are the current revival of the Icarians, Justin sets off to save them from the Gaia-fused Baal, who now faces mutiny among his troops, including his son Mullen. With Gaia proving more than a match for the entire Garlyle army, Leen accepts her destiny and sacrifices herself to lower his defenses. Although Mullen pleads with Feena to finish Gaia, Justin argues that the problem can't be solved with more sacrifice since Gaia will just revive later. Thus Gaia must be defeated outright to end the cycle. Though Gaia defeats the troops and spreads its corruption around the planet, Justin is able to <b>sum</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> courage to face the evil with help from his friends, and travels to the underground heart of Gaia itself to destroy it and the Spirit Stone once and for all. With Gaia defeated permanently, the world experiences a new age of peace. Leen is also restored to life with Gaia's destruction. In an epilogue ten years later, Sue, now a teenager, re-unites with Justin and Feena who arrive home after nearly a decade of adventure, with children in tow.|$|E

500|$|... "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] is a pop {{rock and}} reggaeton song. It {{contains}} samples of Lavigne's song [...] "I'm with You", which is featured on her album Let Go (2002). [...] According to the digital music sheet published at musicnotes.com, {{the song is}} written in the key of E major and is set in simple time with a moderated hip-hop groove. [...] Rihanna's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of E3 to the high note of B4. Lyrically, [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] is a party-drinking song, which is exemplified by the verse [...] "Life's too short to be sittin' around miserable/ People are gonna talk whether you're doin' bad or good/ Don't let the bastards get you down/ Turn it around with another round."

500|$|In Anime Classics Zettai!, Brian Clamp and Julie Davis {{compare the}} first two anime adaptions. They note that the first series is of a serious style, closer to the {{original}} manga with a dark tone and that it focuses on disputes between Lupin and other criminals. In contrast they <b>sum</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> second series as a caper comedy with a more comedic tone and style. Both Chris Beveridge of Mania.com and Mike Crandol of ANN disliked the dub of the second television series because Pioneer Entertainment used many modern references and updated dialogue for a series that was released in the late 1970s, although the series itself received a positive overall review from both reviewers. Rob Lineberger of DVD Verdict wrote, [...] "Lupin the Third is James Bond meets Charlie's Angels with Scooby-Doo sensibilities." [...] Monkey Punch believes that the voice work of Yasuo Yamada was a large reason for {{the popularity of the}} anime series.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, critics {{gave the}} song {{generally}} positive reviews. MacKenzie Wilson, {{in his review}} from Allmusic, notes, [...] "Coldplay's indie rock inclinations are also obvious, especially on songs such as 'Don't Panic' and 'Shiver'." [...] In the Pitchfork Media review, Spencer Owen writes, [...] "This subdued, dreamy opener contains Martin's falsetto chorus of 'We live in a beautiful world,' which seems to <b>sum</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> overall sentiment of the record." [...] Robert Christgau alleged that, along with [...] "Yellow", the song {{was one of only}} two good ones on all of Parachutes. Critic Adrian Denning, in his review of the album, compliments, [...] "Both the vocals and guitar are utterly beautiful. It's a song to take solace from, draw comfort from, be quietly awed by." [...] David DeVoe of Hybridmagazine.com wrote: [...] "It is a wonderful song that echoes the promise of what is to come {{on the rest of the}} record. 'Don’t Panic' is filled with excellent guitar tones and a nice grooving back beat, and I love the way the song ends." ...|$|E
500|$|Crosby's songwriting skills {{had also}} {{developed}} rapidly, with Fricke citing [...] "Renaissance Fair" [...] (co-written with McGuinn) {{as an example}} of his increasingly wistful lyricism and writing style. [...] The song was inspired by a visit to the Renaissance Pleasure Faire of Southern California and Byrds expert Tim Connors has noted that its dream-like medieval ambiance {{can be seen as a}} thematic precursor to Crosby's later song [...] "Guinnevere". Fricke has also praised the instrumental interplay between the [...] "church bell peal" [...] of Crosby and McGuinn's guitars, and Hillman's melodic, loping bass, while describing the song as [...] "a radiant evocation of a medieval festival, and by extension the sensual idealism of the hippie dream". [...] Writing for the AllMusic website, critic Bruce Eder attempted to <b>sum</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> song's contemporary relevance by suggesting that it was [...] "a topical song every bit as tied to real events as Buffalo Springfield's 'For What It's Worth'". [...] In addition, Eder also described [...] "Renaissance Fair" [...] as [...] "a perfect synthesis of the group's original electric-folk sound evolved into a new, more contemporary form of music and songwriting, almost hippie-folk music".|$|E
500|$|New York {{magazine}} writer Steve Kendell said, [...] "The finale was as {{on point}} as any episode this year—smart, funny, crisply written, and poignant." [...] Kandell said Mark accepting a buyout {{felt like a}} [...] "perfectly sensible and organic to the story" [...] way to remove the character from the series, and described the ending scene with Ron and Wendy as an effective cliffhanger building up to the third season. Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic said, [...] "We can <b>sum</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> episode in one word: perfection." [...] Hochberger praised the characterization in the script, and particularly enjoyed that the former pit, a long-time device for the series, {{was used for the}} concert and Mark's departure. CraveOnline writer Blair Marnell described [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] {{as one of the best}} episodes of the series. He praised the writing, particularly the jokes involving Andy and Ron's love of budget cuts, but said Leslie's character ultimately carried the story and had the best jokes. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said the episode [...] "end an already phenomenal season on a high note" [...] and said she loved the symmetry of the finale. Gallagher particularly praised Scott's new character, claiming [...] "his bruised idealism is a nice match for Leslie's blind idealism", but said Lowe's character continued to lack depth, and described the April and Andy subplot as predictable.|$|E

500|$|... "Cool" [...] was {{originally}} written by Dallas Austin {{after listening to}} Stefani's group No Doubt's song [...] "Underneath It All" [...] (2002). Austin commented {{that he was trying}} to write his version of No Doubt's [...] "Simple Kind of Life", but he was unable to finish the song. He later asked Stefani if she wanted to co-write lyrics. During a studio session together, they finished [...] "Cool" [...] in 15 minutes. Stefani commented, [...] "When he told me about the track and where it came from for him, it just triggered something in me." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] reflect Stefani's former relationship with No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal. Although their romantic relationship ended, the lyrics portray Stefani's attitude that it is [...] "cool" [...] that they still remain very good friends. Stefani and Kanal's relationship had provided the inspiration for No Doubt's [...] "Don't Speak" [...] (1996), and while [...] "Cool" [...] presents an amicable friendship between former lovers, [...] "Don't Speak" [...] is about a failing relationship and never arrives at a solution for the couple. Stefani said that she had never intended to include [...] "personal" [...] material on Love. Angel. Music. Baby., and commented, [...] "but no matter what you do, things just come out. It just ended this whole thing for me in my head, and it puts an end to a chapter in a really nice way."

500|$|Under one person, one vote, each country's {{number of}} votes is {{directly}} proportional to its population. This {{would be similar to}} how U.S. states are represented in the United States House of Representatives. In The Future of Sovereignty – Rethinking a Key Concept of International Relations, Hasenclever et al. <b>sum</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> advantages and disadvantages of this system: [...] "In a strict meaning of democracy based on individuals as subjects, every person's vote would have to have exactly the same weight. None of the known proposals, however, supports such a strict interpretation, because the inequality among the states' voting powers would be extreme with only four countries – China, India, the United States and the former USSR – disposing of an absolute majority." [...] A way to resolve the disparity in population between countries would be to apportion representation to regions instead of nations. This would, for example, place Suriname and Brazil, the least and most populated South American countries, in a single South American voting bloc of approximately 400 million people, preserving the one person, one vote system while eliminating extreme disparities in population. This approach, however, is dependent upon elected officials being entrusted to represent said regions and not just their home countries, and could potentially leave some less populated countries with no representatives from their country if they are either outvoted by people in more populated countries in their assigned region or if the people in less populated countries vote in large numbers for candidates or political parties from other countries.|$|E
