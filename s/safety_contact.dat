5000|$|Because {{football}} is a high-contact sport requiring {{a balance between}} offense and defense, many rules exist that regulate equality, <b>safety,</b> <b>contact,</b> and actions of players on each team. It {{is very difficult to}} always avoid violating these rules without giving up too much of an advantage. Thus, an elaborate system of fouls and penalties has been developed to [...] "let the punishment fit the crime" [...] and maintain a balance between following the rules and keeping a good flow of the game. Players and coaches are constantly looking for ways to find an advantage that stretches the limitations imposed by the rules. Also, the frequency and severity of fouls can make a large difference in the outcome of a game, so coaches are constantly looking for ways to minimize the number and severity of infractions committed by their players.|$|E
5000|$|Amtgard combat is {{resolved}} with actual physical fighting, {{though there are}} some rules in place to enhance safety. The weapons are boffer weapons (with less emphasis on realism and more emphasis on safety) but a player's physical ability, rather than game-based attributes as with other LARPs, determines the outcome allowing for a more realistic experience. Injuries are quite rare due to the stringent attention paid to <b>safety.</b> <b>Contact</b> is limited between fighters and non-weapon tactics like grappling or shield bashing are strictly prohibited. The basic combat rules are nearly identical to Dagorhir with a [...] "limb loss" [...] system based on hit location, in contrast to games such as NERO that are hit-point based. A hit from a weapon does not decrease a [...] "hit point" [...] total, but instead disables the location struck. A blow to the arm or leg disables the limb and {{a blow to the}} torso kills the player's character. Any combination of 2 limb shots also kills the player's character. Two limb shots to the same arm is also considered a death, while multiple shots to the same leg have no effect after the first shot. An exception to this rule occurs when a player chooses to [...] "post" [...] instead of kneeling, which is the normal requirement upon being struck in the leg. A player who chooses to post may remain standing, but is not allowed to move the wounded leg, save to pivot. Players may choose to post due to bad knees, rocky or wet terrain, or simply because they do not wish to kneel. Upon the [...] "wounded" [...] player declaring [...] "posting" [...] the leg is once again a valid target. If a player struck in the leg is kneeling and then raises the wounded knee off the ground, it is a valid target. Amtgard fighting tends to be fast and precise, focusing more on accuracy than on power.|$|E

50|$|The typical {{design of}} a first-generation safety relay {{is based on the}} classic three-contactor combination. The {{redundant}} design ensures that wiring errors do not lead to the loss of the safety function. Two relays (K1, K2) with positive-guided contacts provide the safe switching contacts. The two input circuits CH1 and CH2 each activate one of the two internal relays. The circuit is activated via the start relay K3. There is another monitoring circuit between the connection points Y1 and Y2 (feedback loop). This connection is used to check and monitor the position of actuators, which are activated or shut down via the <b>safety</b> <b>contacts.</b> The device is designed {{in such a way that}} any faults in the input circuit are detected, e.g. contact welding on an emergency off/emergency stop pushbutton or on one of the <b>safety</b> <b>contacts</b> on the output relay. The safety device stops the device switching back on and thereby stops the activation of relays K1 and K2.|$|R

40|$|Purpose of {{the review}} The purpose of this review was (i) to find and {{summarise}} all the available research evidence on the quality and costs of dispersed community-based housing when compared with clustered housing, (ii) to assess {{the strength of the}} research and identify gaps in the evidence and (iii) to interpret the research to outline the benefits and drawbacks of each model. Studies reviewed This review found 19 papers based on 10 studies presenting data comparing dispersed housing with some kind of clustered housing (village communities, residential campuses or clusters of houses). This is a sizeable body of research reporting the experience of nearly 2, 500 people from four different countries. The studies covered all eight domains of quality of life, providing information on about 80 different aspects of these domains. Five studies included data on different aspects of service design and operation and three presented comparative costs. Almost all of the studies used quantitative methods with robust approaches to measurement. All studies focused on people with intellectual disabilities. Results Dispersed housing {{has been found to be}} superior to clustered settings in at least some aspects of every outcomes than dispersed housing for people with intellectual disabilities. In terms of the quality of life domains of social inclusion, material well-being, self-determination, personal development and rights there are no studies reporting benefits of clustered settings. In the physical well-being domain, clustered settings have been found to be superior in hours of recreational activity, contact with dentists, psychiatrists and psychologists, some health screening, some aspects of <b>safety,</b> <b>contact</b> with family and friends, visitors to the home and satisfaction with relationships. However, in many of these cases the better results refer only to village communities and not to campus housing or clustered housing. These serve a minority of the less disabled population and they depend on a supply of people willing to live communally with disabled residents. They are therefore an important part of the spectrum of service provision but they are only ever likely to occupy a niche in the market for care. They are unlikely to be a feasible option across the board for disabled people. In terms of costs, the commonest finding is that clustered housing is less expensive than dispersed housing. However, this cost difference appears to be due to differences in staffing levels – i. e. fewer staff are provided to support people in clustered housing than in dispersed housing. In two of the three studies which examined costs controlling for this variable there was no statistically significant difference – in one case between specialised campus and specialised dispersed housing and in the other between samples matched for client characteristics. Conclusion There is much less evidence comparing clustered settings with dispersed housing than comparing other congregate care settings (such as institutions) with dispersed housing. The results should therefore be treated with caution. They do, however, present a broadly consistent picture...|$|E

30|$|Because a {{wearable}} robot {{is directly}} {{attached to the}} human body and exerts assistive torque and force through the contact area, regardless of the part to which it is attached [7 – 10], the <b>contact</b> <b>safety</b> of the wearable robot has to be considered carefully. In particular, blister generation around the contact area is a major concern from the viewpoint of <b>contact</b> <b>safety</b> because skin blisters occur under repetitive rubbing [11, 12]. To assess the risk of blister generation, it is important to estimate the interaction force at the contact area because the magnitude of the shear force critically affects the endurance time of blister generation [13, 14]. Thus, in previous studies, the interaction force exerted at the contact area of the upper-limb [15] and the lower-limb [16] during human–robot interaction was measured.|$|R

40|$|When {{confronted with}} an adverse {{response}} to contact lens wear, practitioners are often quick to 'blame the victim'. Although patient compliance {{may well be}} lacking, {{the reasons for this}} need to be considered carefully, along with all of the other possible contributing factors, if the <b>safety</b> of <b>contact</b> lens wear is to be improved. This Presidential Address briefly reviews what the contact lens literature has revealed about patient compliance in the context of what has been known for many years in general eye care and, indeed, general medicine. Essentially, compliance with contact lens systems is poor (40 - 90 % of patients are noncompliant) and difficult to predict in individual patients. Neither a compliance-enhancement strategy (intense education) nor reduction of the cost of goods has any significant effect upon the level of compliance. Assessment of personality is not a reliable compliance predictor. A compliance enhancement model is proposed which encompasses the following four components: (a) the clinic and the practitioner, (b) the patient, (c) the advice that is given, and (d) the contact lens industry...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Functional Rehabilitation and Reeducation Centre (CRRF) in Noth in the {{department}} of Creuse in France is seeking permanent home automation solutions that help patients to safely have more autonomy in everyday life. An experimental apartment consisting of a bedroom, a bathroom and a kitchen was equipped with communicating devices and remote controls. The aim is to validate the possibility of returning home a patient who have stayed at the medical centre and have motor and cognitive disabilities. A Konnex EIB/KNX bus is used to interface all the sensors and actuators. In the bedroom, an environment controller allows to control objects often inaccessible to the patient because of his disability. Ambient and reading light, shutters, heating, nurse call and television are actuated by conventional switches which have been increased and relayed by the controller. Different functions of the bed can be remotely controlled such as the folding legs, the inclination of the headrest and the height of the bed. A contrast of the switches has been adapted for better visibility. Easily understandable pictograms have been added for an intuitive use. The bedroom door is managed through push up buttons that can be switched with the elbow for a person in a wheelchair. In the bathroom, occupancy sensors have been installed to adjust lighting for better use of toilets facilities. Counting of water associated with flood detection prevents and detects potential overflow of sanitary and bath. In the kitchen, the height of work plans and mobile furniture is adjustable by hand or knee to facilitate access for people with motor disabilities, with <b>safety</b> <b>contacts</b> in case of obstacles. Scenarios have been defined with ergo therapists to prevent the patient against electrical, gas and water dangers in the apartment. These scenarios are managed by a controller that determines the type and degree of danger: the high level (gas, iron, fire risk) and the low level for events that do not require immediate action (oven, electric hob, gas hob, coffee maker and microwave oven). The supervision software used enables the complete management of all alarms and commands transiting through the communication bus via a MODBUS TCP interface. Doctors and therapists will be able to follow the daily activities in the apartment to assess the ability of residents to return home. The system also targets the requirements of housing adjustment aimed at dependent persons returning to their homes...|$|R
