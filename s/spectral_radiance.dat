25|$|Thinking theoretically, Kirchhoff went {{a little}} further, and pointed out that this implied that the <b>spectral</b> <b>radiance,</b> as a {{function}} of radiative frequency, of any such cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium must be a unique universal function of temperature. He postulated an ideal black body that interfaced with its surrounds in just {{such a way as to}} absorb all the radiation that falls on it. By the Helmholtz reciprocity principle, radiation from the interior of such a body would pass unimpeded, directly to its surrounds without reflection at the interface. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the thermal radiation emitted from such a body would have that unique universal <b>spectral</b> <b>radiance</b> {{as a function of}} temperature. This insight is the root of Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation.|$|E
25|$|Measurement of the {{spectrum}} of electromagnetic radiation from an ideal three-dimensional black body can provide an accurate temperature measurement because the frequency of maximum <b>spectral</b> <b>radiance</b> of black-body radiation is directly proportional to {{the temperature of the}} black body; this is known as Wien's displacement law and has a theoretical explanation in Planck's law and the Bose–Einstein law.|$|E

25|$|For {{refractory}} materials (e.g. platinum, tungsten, tantalum, some carbides and nitrides, etc.) the extremely {{high melting point}} (typically considered to be above, say, 1800°C) may be determined by heating the material in a black body furnace and measuring the black-body temperature with an optical pyrometer. For the highest melting materials, this may require extrapolation by several hundred degrees. The <b>spectral</b> <b>radiance</b> from an incandescent body {{is known to be}} a function of its temperature. An optical pyrometer matches the radiance of a body under study to the radiance of a source that has been previously calibrated as a function of temperature. In this way, the measurement of the absolute magnitude of the intensity of radiation is unnecessary. However, known temperatures must be used to determine the calibration of the pyrometer. For temperatures above the calibration range of the source, an extrapolation technique must be employed. This extrapolation is accomplished by using Planck's law of radiation. The constants in this equation are not known with sufficient accuracy, causing errors in the extrapolation to become larger at higher temperatures. However, standard techniques have been developed to perform this extrapolation.|$|E
