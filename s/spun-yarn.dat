2500|$|This {{suggests}} that Caroline was converted from a lugger to a brig between September and November. The Naval Chronicle reported that on 16 December 1804, the [...] "Caroline, hired armed brig of 14 guns, Lieutenant Derby, sailed from Plymouth with a convoy." [...] On 5 January 1805, the [...] "Caroline brig of 14 Guns, Lieutenant Derby" [...] had arrived safely at Plymouth after having experienced [...] "very terrible gales of Wind, but owing to her being so clever, tight, and well-found a vessel, {{she did not}} strain a <b>spun-yarn.</b> ... She is a beautiful, fast-sailing Vessel of her class." [...] Three days later, Caroline was back in Plymouth from Milford Haven, having convoyed a very large, leaky South Sea whaler to Dartmouth. On 19 January Caroline sailed again.|$|E
2500|$|The second mate's is proverbially a dog's berth. [...] He {{is neither}} officer nor man. [...] The {{men do not}} respect him as an officer, and he is obliged to go aloft to reef and furl the [...] topsails, and to put his hands into the tar and slush, with the rest. [...] The crew call him the [...] "sailor's waiter," [...] as he has to furnish them with <b>spun-yarn,</b> marline, and all other stuffs that they need in their work, and has charge of the boatswain's locker, which {{includes}} serving-boards, marline-spikes, etc. [...] He is expected by the captain to maintain his dignity and to enforce obedience, and still is kept at a great distance from the mate, and obliged {{to work with the}} crew. [...] He is one to whom little is given and of whom much is required. [...] His wages are usually double those of a common sailor, and he eats and sleeps in the cabin; but he is obliged to be on deck nearly all the time, and eats at the second table, that is, makes a meal out of what the captain and chief mate leave.|$|E

50|$|Friction spun yarns DREF yarns have bulky {{appearance}} (100-140% bulkier {{than the}} ring spun yarns). The twist is not uniform and found with loopy yarn surface. Friction spun yarns {{with a high}} %age of core have a high stiffness. Friction spun yarns are usually weak as compared to other yarns. The yarns possess only 60% of the tenacity of ring-spun yarns and about 90% of rotor <b>spun-yarns.</b> The increased twist and wrapping of the sheath over the core improve the cohesion between the core and sheath and within the sheath.|$|R
6000|$|... "Walk this way, gentlemen--walk this way, if you please," [...] said Mr. Marble, encouragingly, {{passing a}} ball of <b>spun-yarn,</b> all the while, to help a rigger serve a rope. [...] "When did you leave the country?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Arrested!" [...] said Moses, {{eyeing the}} sheriff's officer with {{sovereign}} contempt; {{though he was}} a sturdy fellow, and one who had every disposition to do his duty. [...] "Arrested! Why, Miles, you can handle both these chaps, yourself; and, with Neb's and my assistance, could work 'em up into <b>spun-yarn</b> without a winch!" ...|$|E
60|$|To bind up Swinton's wounds, some {{of which}} were ugly ones, was the first {{business}} of Grummidge, after he had hastily staunched the blood which was flowing copiously from his own cheek. The stout seaman was well able to play the part of amateur surgeon, being a handy fellow, and he usually carried about with him two or three odd pieces of <b>spun-yarn</b> for emergencies--also a lump of cotton-waste as a handkerchief, while the tail of his shirt served at all times as a convenient rag.|$|E
60|$|But {{there is}} one very {{extensive}} warehouse among the rest that needs special mention--the ship's Yeoman's storeroom. In the Neversink it was down in the ship's basement, beneath the berth-deck, and you went to it {{by way of the}} Fore-passage, a very dim, devious corridor, indeed. Entering--say at noonday--you find yourself in a gloomy apartment, lit by a solitary lamp. On one side are shelves, filled with balls of marline, ratlin-stuf, seizing-stuff, <b>spun-yarn,</b> and numerous twines of assorted sizes. In another direction you see large cases containing heaps of articles, reminding one of a shoemaker's furnishing-store--wooden serving-mallets, fids, toggles, and heavers: iron prickers and marling-spikes; in a third quarter you see a sort of hardware shop--shelves piled with all manner of hooks, bolts, nails, screws, and thimbles; and, in still another direction, you see a block-maker's store, heaped up with lignum-vitae sheeves and wheels.|$|E
6000|$|At sea, {{the sailors}} are {{continually}} engaged in [...] "parcelling," [...] "serving," [...] {{and in a}} thousand ways ornamenting and repairing the numberless shrouds and stays; mending sails, or turning {{one side of the}} deck into a rope-walk, where they manufacture a clumsy sort of twine, called <b>spun-yarn.</b> This is spun with a winch; and many an hour the Lancashire boy had to play the part of an engine, and contribute the motive power. For material, they use odds and ends of old rigging called [...] "junk," [...] the yarns of which are picked to pieces, and then twisted into new combinations, something as most books are manufactured. This [...] "junk" [...] is bought at the junk shops along the wharves; outlandish looking dens, generally subterranean, full of old iron, old shrouds, spars, rusty blocks, and superannuated tackles; and kept by villainous looking old men, in tarred trowsers, and with yellow beards like oakum. They look like wreckers; and the scattered goods they expose for sale, involuntarily remind one of the sea-beach, covered with keels and cordage, swept ashore in a gale.|$|E
6000|$|The {{difficulty}} of sounding great depths {{arises from the}} fact that, after a large quantity of line has been run out, {{the shock of the}} lead striking the bottom cannot be felt. Moreover, there is sufficient force in the deep-sea currents to sweep out the line after the lead has reached the bottom so that, with the ordinary sounding-lines in use among navigators, it is impossible to sound great depths. Scientific men have, therefore, taxed their brains to invent instruments for sounding the deep sea--for touching the bottom in what sailors call [...] "blue water." [...] Some have tried it with a silk thread as a plumb-line, some with <b>spun-yarn</b> threads, and various other materials and contrivances. It has even been tried by exploding petards and ringing bells in the deep sea, when it was supposed that an echo or reverberation might be heard, and, from the known rate at which sound travels through water, the depth might thus be ascertained. Deep-sea leads have been constructed having a column of air in them, which, by compression, would show the aqueous pressure to which they had been subjected; but the trial proved to be more than the instrument could stand.|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] he continued, [...] "will be {{a certain}} sign, my friends, that the star is in motion, since we can all see that the {{compasses}} are just {{where they have been}} ever since we left Palos de Moguer. When one of two things is in motion, and it is certain which stands still, there can be no great difficulty in saying which is the uneasy one. Now, look thou here, Martin Martinez," [...] {{who was one of the}} most factious of the disaffected; [...] "words are of little use when men can prove their meaning by experiments like this. Thou seest two balls of <b>spun-yarn</b> on this windlass; well, it is wanted to be known which of them remains there, and which is taken away. I remove the smallest ball, thou perceivest, and the largest remains; from which it followeth, as only one can remain, and that one is the larger ball, why the smaller must be taken away. I hold no man fit to steer a caravel, by needle or by star, who will deny a thing that is proven as plainly and as simply as this!" ...|$|E

50|$|Patiala is fast {{emerging}} {{as an important}} industrial growth centre on the industrial map of the state. besides traditional goods, high quality and sophisticated items are now produced including small cutting tools, power cables, Vanaspati ghee, bicycles and agriculture implements including harvester combines and threshers, milk products, pesticides etc. The industrial units are {{scattered all over the}} district mainly at Rajpura, Patiala, Samana and Nabha. There are large and medium industrial units located at Rajpura producing Vanaspati ghee, power cables, bicycles and bicycle components and at Dera bassi producing <b>spun-yarn</b> and alcohol. Among the small scale industry in the district are those producing agriculture implements, rice shellers, cutting tools, electrical goods and bakeries. There are Industrial Focal Points at Patiala, Rajpura, Nabha and Dera bassi and two Industrial Estates at Rajpura, Patiala.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1840s {{personal}} narrative Two Years Before the Mast, {{the author}} (Richard Henry Dana, Jr.) describes {{the role of}} a second mate on an American merchant trading brig as follows:The second mate's is proverbially a dog's berth.
