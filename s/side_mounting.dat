5|$|Side-mount {{cylinders}} are cylinders {{clipped to}} the harness at the diver's sides which carry bottom gas when the diver does not carry back mount cylinders. They {{may be used}} in conjunction with other side mounted stage, travel and/or decompression cylinders where necessary. Skilled side-mount divers may carry as many as three cylinders on each side. This configuration was developed for access through tight restrictions in caves. <b>Side</b> <b>mounting</b> is primarily used for technical diving, but is also sometimes used for recreational diving, when a single cylinder may be carried, complete with secondary second stage (octopus) regulator, in a configuration sometimes referred to as monkey diving.|$|E

5000|$|The X {{design was}} {{introduced}} in 1972 with the Peugeot 104. It was an all-aluminium alloy SOHC inline-four design with two valves per cylinder driven by a chain, using petrol as fuel. It was applied transversely in front wheel drive vehicles only, tilted by an almost horizontal attitude of 72°. The integral transmission is mounted on the rear side of the crankcase (thus appearing to be underneath the power unit when it is mounted in the vehicle), and is driven by transfer gears which give a distinctive [...] "whine" [...] - a trait shared with the BMC A-Series engine, which uses a similar construction. Displacement ranged between 954 and 1,360 cc. The <b>side</b> <b>mounting</b> of the transmission onto the crankcase is what {{gives rise to the}} nickname [...] "suitcase engine", as the transmission and engine assemblies resemble two halves of a suitcase when they are split for disassembly.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, many {{pickup trucks}} come {{equipped}} with {{one to three}} mounting holes placed in the center area of the rear bumper to accommodate the mounting of trailer tow balls. The ones on the extreme left or right are often used by drivers in rural areas who tow wide farm equipment on two-lane roads. The far <b>side</b> <b>mounting</b> allows for the item (trailer, etc.) being towed to be further away from {{the opposite side of}} the road (oncoming traffic, etc.). Caution must be taken when using the bumper of a pickup truck for towing rather than using a frame mounted receiver hitch, as the bumper does not provide for as much strength and therefore is generally used to tow lighter loads. Weight ratings for both bumper-mounted and frame-mounted receiver hitches can be found on bumper of pickup trucks (for bumper-mounted tow balls) and on the receiver hitch (for frame-mounted receiver hitches). Many pickup trucks without frame-mounted receiver hitches often use the rear bumper, especially if the pickup truck is a light duty (not full size) pickup truck.|$|E
