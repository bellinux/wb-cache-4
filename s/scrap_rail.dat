50|$|However, on {{delivery}} of both <b>scrap</b> <b>rail</b> and rolling stock, Woodham's found that commercially {{it was easier}} to both comply with the contract terms and conditions and turn a profit if they concentrated on the easier to <b>scrap</b> <b>rail</b> profile and rolling stock. There was also at least ten times the volume of wagons, which took up more space and reduced Woodham's capacity to bid on more contracts. Hence it was agreed internally to leave the more difficult locomotives until later, perhaps picking up the work when the volume of rolling stock and railway line abated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{accident}} {{happened after}} a wagon laden with lengths of steel rail {{ran away from}} a maintenance location on the line at Scout Green {{because it did not}} have properly working brakes. Wooden chocks had been placed in front of the wagon to stop it moving because the hydraulic brakes had been disconnected due to a fault; however they had not been repaired or replaced. As a maintenance worker began using an excavator's [...] "log grab" [...] in an attempt to drag sections of <b>scrap</b> <b>rail</b> from the wagon, the action caused the wooden blocks to dislodge. Slowly the wagon began to move downhill gathering momentum on the 1 in 75 gradient from Shap summit.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a new method for forming grinding media balls from <b>scrap</b> <b>rail</b> heads. This forming method involves the following operations: cutting the rail {{head to the}} desired length combined with lateral pressing of the produced workpiece; flashless die forging and sizing of balls in a helical impression. The proposed method was verified by numerical simulation which involved the modeling of a forming process for producing 80 mm diameter balls. As {{a result of the}} modeling, it was possible to examine the changes in the workpiece shape during each forming operation, the variations in loads and torques, as well as the distribution of temperatures enabling performing another forming operation, i. e. quenching. The results confirm that the designed method can be used to produce balls...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative helical rolling process of balls destined for mills manufac¬tured from a <b>scrapped</b> <b>rail</b> head. In this process, helical rolls are applied, whose construction allows obtaining a cylindrical bar, and later balls are formed from this {{bar in the}} further stage of the process. It is advised to precede the rolling process by side pressing leading to increase of billet material shape compactness. Verification of the assumed solution correctness was made using numerical sim¬ulation, with the application of Simufact. Forming software...|$|R

In 1882, 43 tons of <b>scrap,</b> probably <b>rails,</b> were sold from the line by the NBR, and by July 1896 all the rails had been lifted and sold except for 300 yards to Inverkeithing brickworks, and 377 yards at the northern end.|$|R
50|$|With {{the closure}} and {{demolition}} of the Upton (formerly Lytchett Brick Co.

5000|$|To {{solve the}} issue of coupler compatibility, a group of vans were fitted with dual {{couplers}} recovered from scrapped steam locomotives. This allowed them {{to be used as}} transition vehicles between newer diesel locomotives, fitted with automatic couplings, and older passenger cars fitted with screw couplers. Dates of conversion are not recorded, but vans altered were marked with a letter [...] "P" [...] painted in the upper corners, standing for [...] "plural". This was explicitly different from the [...] "P" [...] marking later applied to freight stock permitted to travel at passenger train speeds of 70 mph; these vans were only allowed to run at 60 mph. The extra speed was made possible by the addition of a false floor covering 3 lt 0 Lcwt 0 qtr t of <b>scrap</b> <b>rails.</b> The lower centre of gravity also improved the ride quality relative to track state, but did nothing for slack action. From 1956 the vans were officially recoded ZP, rather than just Z with [...] "P" [...] markings. The vans fitted exclusively with automatic couplers were not recoded ZA, because by that time the entire fleet was autocoupler-compatible.|$|R
50|$|Three locomotives, E3002, E3009, and E3019, were {{withdrawn}} {{before they}} could be renumbered under the TOPS system.

50|$|Restoration {{of one of}} Brooklyn's trolley/light rail routes, in Red Hook, was {{hampered}} due to the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) withdrawing {{its support}} from the project. The DOT identified several potential improvements which {{did not include a}} streetcar however, that would improve access and mobility for neighborhood residents. Construction was stopped on a 7-block extension to the line due to the removal and <b>scrapping</b> of <b>rails,</b> ties, and other items of railroad equipment by the DOT, which were stored on land that was slated for the Fairway supermarket project.|$|R
50|$|The last {{service to}} run on the line was a special passenger-only service to Toronto to bring well-wishers to the Royal Tour of 1939 by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. The war was only months away at this point, and as Canada entered the war effort the railway was {{eventually}} sold as <b>scrap,</b> its <b>rails</b> fed into steel mills for the war effort.

50|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in the 1930s, {{construction}} once again stopped. In 1933, most of the Big Creek railroad - which had carried 400,000 tons of goods during its 21 years of operation - was dismantled and sold for <b>scrap.</b> The original <b>railbed</b> was then used as a road.|$|R
5000|$|On April 9, 2001, Mayor Paul Schell sent {{a letter}} {{requesting}} that due to the challenges facing the northern segment of the route (South Lander Street to the University District), Sound Transit should focus on building the southern fourteen miles of the line.

However, Councilman Licata was of the opinion that Schell's proposal didn't go far enough because it did not consider <b>scrapping</b> light <b>rail</b> completely and focusing the money on carpool lanes and expanding the monorail.|$|R
50|$|In August 1905, a train {{going down}} the hill from Silverwood Colliery to Roundwood could not hold back its load and the locomotive, Dalton Main Colliery No.4 (Andrew Barclay, Works No. 1021, built 1904) was overpowered. The crew jumped after passing over the River Don bridge. The driver {{suffered}} only shock. The fireman was slightly injured. At {{the point where the}} colliery line passed below the Great Central line the locomotive left the rails but stayed upright through the bridge and fell into the marshy ground beyond. The wagons were totally destroyed and the track seriously damaged. The locomotive was repaired and survived a further 21 years until being <b>scrapped.</b> Slippery <b>rails</b> covered with natural evening moisture together with water dripping from the wagonloads of 'slack' were blamed.|$|R
2500|$|By the 1980s the {{character}} of the valley was largely industrial. [...] It contained a <b>scrap</b> yard, a <b>rail</b> yard, a sanitation facility, an energy plant, and a jail. Several landowners banded together to lobby for a new interchange with the Beltway, and by the mid-1990s the area had been transformed with a large amount of commercial and residential development. A small area plan was adopted by the city in 2013 to encourage further transformation of the neighborhood.|$|R
50|$|In 1964 it was {{reported}} that freight traffic on the branch included agricultural machinery, bricks, chocolate, coal and coke, custard and jelly, explosives, glassware, grain, motor cars scrap metal, sugar beet, and timber. The docks at Felixstowe were expanding and in 1967 started handling container traffic. It was decided that a direct link to the docks was desirable and in 1970 the Trimley - Felixstowe Beach link was restored and the Town branch was reduced to a single tracked stub with all the former goods yard (closed 1966) and platform tracks removed. The goods yards at Westerfield Junction and Trimley closed in 1964 but that at Derby Road continued into the 1980s serving a domestic coal depot and a <b>scrap</b> yard. <b>Rail</b> traffic to Cranes finished in mid-1970s and to Ransome, Sims and Jefferies in 1980.|$|R
25|$|Despite their key {{place in}} Australian {{transport}} history, {{and at least}} one attempt to set aside an example for future preservation, the Sclass locomotives were <b>scrapped</b> before the <b>rail</b> preservation movement had gained enough momentum to avoid the loss of the entire class. However, the Australian Railway Historical Society has noted that the loss of the Sclass helped to galvanise railway enthusiasts into lobbying for the preservation of other VR locomotives (beginning with the X class), and the establishment of the Australian Railway Historical Society Museum.|$|R
500|$|A serious {{incident}} occurred on 17 October 2004, when Wessex Trains [...] Pacer DMU 143613, forming the 20:06 2W63 service from [...] to [...] with 143621, caught fire between {{the site of}} the former station at [...] and Nailsea and Backwell. Fire services took two hours to get the blaze under control. None of the 23 passengers and crew were killed, but three were treated on-site for the effects of smoke inhalation. One carriage was completely burnt out, and the other was badly damaged, causing the train to be written off. The line through Nailsea was closed until 03:30 the following morning, when the train was hauled to St Philips Marsh Traction and Rolling Stock Maintenance Depot for examination. The unit was later taken to Crewe Works, where it was stored, then to Cardiff Canton TMD where it was <b>scrapped.</b> The <b>Rail</b> Safety and Standards Board issued a report into the incident, concluding that the fire was caused by electrical arcing between the live starter motor cable (which had damaged insulation) and the unit's underframe, causing accumulated oily residues to ignite.|$|R

25|$|Nineteen of the children's {{bodies were}} buried {{on or near}} school grounds in protest. Across Bihar, {{numerous}} students refused to eat their meals {{in the days following}} the incident. On 17 July, hundreds of Mashrakh residents took to the streets in protest. Demonstrators lit fires and burned effigies of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. Four police vehicles were damaged by the fires. Others threw stones at the police station and chanted slogans denouncing the government. Some villagers demanded that the Midday Meal program be <b>scrapped.</b> Roads and <b>rail</b> lines were blocked by angry protesters carrying sticks and poles.

In nearby Chhapra, multiple arson attacks were reported, including reports that a crowd set fire to a bus, but no injuries were reported from either city.|$|R
50|$|The trains were {{introduced}} in 1981, but almost immediately taken out of service. During initial tests, some passengers complained of being nauseous due to the tilting motion. Subsequently, it was learned {{that this could be}} prevented by reducing the tilt slightly, so that there was still some sensation of cornering. The APT-P trains were quietly reintroduced into service in mid-1984 and ran regularly for a year, the teething problems having been corrected. However, the political and managerial will to continue the project, by building the projected APT-S production vehicles in numbers, had evaporated under an in-house engineering management who felt slighted and by-passed in a project they did not develop. Despite being an eventual success, the project was <b>scrapped</b> by British <b>Rail</b> in 1985, more for political reasons than technical. This was another British innovation that was left to others to widely implement.|$|R
50|$|Even by {{the late}} 1970s Lowestoft was still {{handling}} 25,000 tonnes of freight, an increase of some 18,000 compared to the mid 1970s. Goods consisted of domestic coal which was brought by train to a concentration depot {{at the end of}} Rotterdam Road, imported steel ingots which were sent on by <b>rail,</b> <b>scrap</b> metal exported to Spain by A. King & Sons and brought to Lowestoft by rail, imported Ford cars and container trains after an Orient Overseas Container Line ship was diverted from Felixstowe. The sleeper works was also producing around five wagon loads of concrete sleepers, posts and platform sections a day. Traffic declined in the 1980s as a result of national policies and trends, the withdrawal of vacuum-braked wagons leading to a loss in coal traffic and the increase in charges for imported steel resulting in this traffic moving to other ports.|$|R
5000|$|Following the Beeching Report in 1963, {{the line}} was set to close. It did so, to all traffic between Chadderton Junction and Oldham Werneth on 7 January 1963. Oldham Central Station closed later in the 1960s. Soon after, on 13 March 1964, saw the pulling up and <b>scrapping</b> of the <b>rails</b> and other railway goods on the Middleton Junction and Oldham Branch Railway. The Chadderton goods and coal depot {{remained}} open at this stage as a short freight only branch from Middleton Junction. Over the years {{the rest of the}} line which went to the Chadderton depot was closed and scrapped, and the countryside slowly took over.

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1919, the {{suspended}} lines began to be reinstated, and the numbering of some lines was changed. Lines from Promenade were redirected to Stadtgraben, after which the lines to Promenade were scrapped. In 1925, {{the construction of a}} line from Centrum to Heubude (modern Stogi) began; it was opened on 4 July 1927. In 1926, tracks on the newly established Paul-Beneke-Weg were opened, <b>scrapping</b> the single <b>rail</b> along Harbour quay. At the time in Neufahrwasser, two balloon loops were constructed; a small loop for the line from Centrum and a larger loop for the line from Brösen. In 1930, a new line from Grosse Allee across Aleja Hallera and ulica Mickiewicza to the loop at the intersection of aleja Legionów and ulica Kościuszki. On the line between Langfuhr and Oliva, the layout was changed, eliminating the line on ulica Szymanowskiego, building it instead on aleja Wojska Polskiego. Construction began for a new tram depot in Langfuhr.|$|R
50|$|Buncher {{was born}} to a Russian Jewish {{immigrant}} family. In 1917, Harry, his father opened a scrap yard, the Liberty Scrap Co. at 3131 Liberty Avenue. Although he studied medicine and law at Duquesne University, {{he returned to the}} family business in 1931 due to the advent of the Great Depression. In 1935, at the age of 24, he took over his father's business then stretching four blocks in the Strip District. During World War II, the business grew due {{to the demands of the}} war effort. After the war, he founded the The Buncher Company and expanded his operations by opening another scrap yard on the North Side with a focus on scrap steel as well establishing operations in Philadelphia and Mobile, Alabama where he scrapped Liberty ships and other military equipment. Using the proceeds from his business, Buncher began to purchase old railroad properties and rail lines so as to <b>scrap</b> the <b>rails</b> and the ties. This led to general real estate investments and he began to purchase property throughout the city and region including the West End, the South Side, the North Side, and Westmoreland County and Beaver County, becoming one of the city's largest property owners. In the 1950s, he developed the region's first industrial park in Leetsdale, Pennsylvania. In 1960s, he sold his scrap yard on the North Side to the Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority for the construction of Three Rivers Stadium. In the 1980s, he a sold the right of way to establish the West Busway. In the 1990s, he sold the land for Washington's Landing. Upon his death, Buncher left behind one of the largest real estate portfolios seen in Pittsburgh.|$|R
5|$|The Angel of Darkness started {{development}} {{three years}} prior to its release under the working title Tomb Raider next generation. As part of the preparation for the game, the company conducted market research, and decided {{to create a new}} setting and story for the main character. One of the main drives behind the game was fully utilising the new platform's potential and reinventing the character of Lara Croft, including rebuilding her character model and allowing her to perform melee combat. It was the first game in the series to be made for the PlayStation 2 platform: the previous entry in the series, , had pushed the PlayStation to its technical limits, contributing to lower review scores and sales than previous titles in the series. Core Design separated into two teams, with a new team working on Angel of Darkness and series regulars on Tomb Raider: Chronicles. After the completion of Tomb Raider: Chronicles, lead programmer Richard Morton came over and found that the new team had gone off the <b>rails,</b> <b>scrapping</b> the entire project once already and completing only the game's basic story. The developers later admitted to being overambitious. Some of them also commented that none of the Core team were prepared for the added complexity of developing for the advanced PlayStation 2. Jonell Elliott returned as the voice of Lara Croft. This would be the last time she provided the voice, with Keeley Hawes taking over for Tomb Raider: Legend.|$|R
