Improved {{stop mechanism}} allows airflow slot on circulation-control airfoil {{to be limited}} to precise width. <b>Shoulder</b> <b>bushing</b> installed in duct so shoulder rests on inside surface of duct. Bolt slides in bushing in duct wall between more open and less open positions. No relative motion or wear between bolt and slot panel. Prevents bushing from being dislodged by stop forces and provides stiffer stopping surface than sleeve bushing bonded in duct wall...|$|E
6000|$|Peterkin was so tickled {{with the}} {{question}} that he suddenly began to tremble like an aspen leaf, and to chatter with his teeth and display all the symptoms of abject terror. Pointing over Makarooroo's <b>shoulder</b> into the <b>bush</b> behind him, he gasped, [...] "The leopard!" ...|$|R
60|$|Half {{a minute}} later a native showed his head and <b>{{shoulder}}s</b> over a <b>bush</b> as he rose to fire. Before he could raise his gun to his shoulder he fell with a bullet through his head from Mr. Atherton's unerring rifle. That gentleman quietly reloaded.|$|R
6000|$|As {{the chief}} landed he {{was met by}} the Pathfinder, who {{addressed}} him {{in the language of}} the warrior's people: [...] "Was it well done, Chingachgook," [...] said he reproachfully, [...] "to ambush a dozen Mingos alone? Killdeer seldom fails me, it is true; but the Oswego makes a distant mark, and that miscreant showed little more than his head and <b>shoulders</b> above the <b>bushes,</b> and an onpractysed hand and eye might have failed. You should have thought of this, chief--you should have thought of this!" ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{top of the}} Iraq album, Kirwan {{noted that}} the war was one which [...] "the working class is fighting". He also stated that {{politicians}} wasted an opportunity (after 9/11) to change the world for the better, placing most blame on the <b>shoulders</b> of then-president <b>Bush</b> Kirwan argued that had there been a Churchill-esque leader then America would have taken the opportunity to rid themselves of dependence on foreign oil, and change the way America communicated {{with the rest of the}} world. He also criticised Bush for using the memory of the victims of 9/11 to justify war as the biggest tragedy that came out of the event.|$|R

The New York {{newspaper}} Long Island Telegraph reported on 20 May 1830 [...] "when two churlish boys were determined to fight, a chip would {{be placed on the}} shoulder of one, and the other demanded to knock it off at his peril". A similar notion is mentioned in the issue of the Onondaga Standard of Syracuse, New York on 8 December 1830: [...] "'He waylay me', said I, 'the mean sneaking fellow - I am only afraid that he will sue me for damages. Oh! if I only could get him to knock a chip off my shoulder, and so get round the law, I would give him one of the soundest thrashings he ever had'." [...] Some time later in 1855 the phrase [...] "chip on his shoulder" [...] appeared in the Weekly Oregonian, stating [...] "Leland, in his last issue, struts out with a chip on his <b>shoulder,</b> and dares <b>Bush</b> to knock it off". In American author Mark Twain's 1898 manuscript of Schoolhouse Hill, character Tom Sawyer states his knowledge of the phrase and custom when he says, [...] "If you want your fuss, and can't wait till recess, which is regular, go at it right and fair; put a chip on your shoulder and dare him to knock it off." ...|$|R
