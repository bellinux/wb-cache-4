50|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>Use</b> Efficiency (SUE) {{is the use}} of {{individual}} and inter-related factors (inherent and dynamic) related to soil quality, soil nutrient availability and nutrient uptake potential as effective reference points for improvement of crop productivity in individual and varying soil types. Assessing SUE involves a site evaluation of the land and pit excavation to examine the soil profile. Site characterization identifies impairments to biomass productivity and the provisioning of ecological services. Inherent impairments are from limits inherent to the land and soil such as steep slope, and subsoil claypan. Dynamic impairments are the result of land degradation, such as soil acidification, loss of soil carbon, water erosion, and wind erosion. Understanding these relationships informs land management decisions needed to restore land productivity. The determination of water-use efficiency (WUE) and Nutrient Use Efficiency (NUE) in agricultural production systems is governed primarily by the boundary conditions of <b>Soil</b> <b>Use</b> Efficiency (SUE).|$|E

50|$|The Instituto de Economia Agrícola (IEA - Agricultural Economics Institute), {{linked to}} the Agência Paulista de Tecnologia dos Agronegócios (APTA) is a major public {{scientific}} research institute on economics and statistics applied to agricultural and farming questions, established in São Paulo, Brazil. The aim to provide technical information to support agribusiness decision makers and governmental policies.IEA was generated in the bosom of Dept. of Vegetable Production (DVP), created within Secretaria de Agricultura e Abastecimento in 1942. During a period to deepen his knowledge of fiber technology area, Agronomical Engineer Dr. Rui Miller Paiva became acquainted with the agricultural economy area and decided to follow that the discipline. Returning to São Paulo, Paiva brought with him ideas and the knowledge {{that led to the}} creation of the Rural Studies Commission, DPV’s antecessor, the first Brazilian pole on economic issues related to agriculture.IEA’s pioneering spirit continued for over 65 years. As early as the end of 1970, for example, researchers from that Institute would carry out assessments about the energetic balance of crops (today the concept is widely used in the discussions on bioenergy) and the effect of the expansion of sugar cane crop on <b>soil</b> <b>use</b> in the São Paulo (replacement of crops). In the latest years, its involvement with techno-science (nanotechnology) and its social and economical effects within agriculture are the highlight.IEA is a pioneer in probability sampling in order to forecast harvests, price surveys and the calculation of the market basket. Currently, it calculates and disseminates agricultural prices every four weeks, or the countryside inflation. The agriculture prices are a reference for the markets, wholesales, retailers and producers, both on a state and national level.IEA’s statistical surveys (prices, production, estimates for harvests, labor market, land market) provided a model for other agriculture economics institutions. IEA introduced the MIT methodology (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), as well as the World Bank’s, for the conception and economical assessment of agriculture development projects. The economical, prognostics, and the production costs analyses, the census of São Paulo agriculture and the cattle raising census, and the technical and scientific magazines have proved to be important information sources for decision-making on public and private policies.The Institute takes part in the formulation of public policies concerning the financing of Fundo de Expansão do Agronegócio Paulista (FEAP) in addition to contributing to the analyses of the support financing for small-scale agri-industry. Its surveys are used as a basis for choosing the municipalities to be benefited by the subsidy projects for the State’s awarding of rural insurance.IEA discloses data on São Paulo’s trade balance per group of commodities, and that ranking was developed by the institution itself. It’s also discloses data on São Paulo and Brazil’s agribusiness per added factor (basic and industrialized products) and by use category.|$|E
40|$|Background Human {{waste is}} used as an {{agricultural}} fertilizer in China and elsewhere. Because the eggs of many helminth species can survive in environmental media, reuse of untreated or partial-ly treated human waste, commonly called night soil, may promote transmission of human helminthiases. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted an open cohort study in 36 villages to evaluate the association between night <b>soil</b> <b>use</b> and schistosomiasis in a region of China where schistosomiasis has re-emerged and persisted despite control activities. We tested 2, 005 residents for Schisto-soma japonicum infection in 2007 and 1, 365 residents in 2010 and interviewed heads of household about agricultural practices each study year. We used an intervention attribut-able ratio framework to estimate the association between night <b>soil</b> <b>use</b> and S. japonicum in-fection. Night <b>soil</b> <b>use</b> was reported by half of households (56 % in 2007 and 46 % in 2010).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to relate earthworm assemblage structure with three different <b>soil</b> <b>use</b> intensities, and to indentify the physical, chemical, and microbiological soil variables that are associated to the observed differences. Three soil uses were evaluated: 1 -Fifty year old naturalized grasslands, low use intensity; 2 -Recent agricultural fields, intermediate use intensity, and 3 -Fifty year old intensive agricultural fields, high use intensity. Three different sites for each <b>soil</b> <b>use</b> were evaluated from winter 2008 through summer 2011. Nine earthworm species were identified across all sampling sites. The sites shared five species: the native Microscolex dubius, and the introduced Aporrectodea caliginosa, A. rosea, Octalasion cyaneum, and O. lacteum, but they differed in relative abundance by <b>soil</b> <b>use.</b> The results show that the earthworm community structure is linked to and modulated by soil properties. Both species abundance and diversity showed significant differences depending on <b>soil</b> <b>use</b> intensity. A principal component analysis showed that species composition is closely related to the environmental variability. The ratio of native to exotic species was significantly lower in the intensive agricultural system when compared to the other two, lower disturbance systems. Microscolex dubius abundance was related to naturalized grasslands along with soil Ca, pH, mechanical resistance, and microbial respiration. Aporrectodea caliginosa abundance was related to high K levels, low enzymatic activity, slightly low pH, low Ca, and appeared related to the highly disturbed environment. Eukerria stagnalis and Aporrectodea rosea, commonly found in the recent agricultural system, were related to high soil moisture condition, low pH, low Ca and low enzymatic activity. These results show that earthworm assemblages can be good indicators of <b>soil</b> <b>use</b> intensities. In particular, Microscolex dubius, Aporrectodea caliginosa, and Aporrectodea rosea, showed different temporal patterns and species associations, due to the changes in soil properties attributable to <b>soil</b> <b>use</b> intensity, defined as the amount and type of agricultural operations...|$|E

However, no association between night soil and schistosomiasis was observed in 2010. These inconsistent findings may be due to unmeasured confounding or temporal shifts in the importance of different sources of S. japonicum eggs on the margins of disease elimination. The use of untreated or partially treated human waste as an agricultural fertilizer may be a barrier to permanent reductions in human helminthiases. This practice warrants further attention by the public health community...|$|E
40|$|In this report, a {{methodology}} is described {{which will allow}} the actual human exposure due to soil contamination to be assessed. Furthermore, the procedure for testing this indicative actual exposure against human toxicological limit values is given. In this way, the soil quality can be assessed {{in relation to the}} resulting human risks. The methodology will be included in a more general decision support system, on which the assessment of soil quality in granting a building permit will be based. Besides location-specific circumstances, the <b>soil</b> <b>use</b> on a location {{is an important factor in}} assessing actual human exposure. For this reason, eight different types of <b>soil</b> <b>use</b> have been defined. For each <b>soil</b> <b>use,</b> a scenario has been defined using standardized exposure parameters. With the help of these scenarios the human exposure specific to <b>soil</b> <b>use</b> on a contaminated site can be calculated.

Besides the sound scientific base, practical application, user-friendliness and unambiguity of the methodology has been given attention. The methodology described reflects a first, provisional approach. Testing will take place in practice, and if necessary the methodology will be adjusted in the future. ...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{urbanisation}} {{trends are}} frequently characterised by spatial fragmentation and scatteredness, as urbanised territories are distributed in space at irregular intervals. In this article, {{it is argued}} that such irregularities in spatial distribution result, at least in part, from the absence of a specific policy design about land use. Soil, in fact, is a public good, finite and non-reproducible. As such, soil management requires well-defined policies preventing misuse and excessive soil consumption for economic sustainability.

Accordingly, commonly agreed measures of <b>soil</b> <b>use</b> should be available for the whole country on a territorial level.
