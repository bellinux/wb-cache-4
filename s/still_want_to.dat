5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas.

However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either.

500|$|Though Reitman {{has claimed}} in countless {{interviews}} {{that he wrote}} the parts specifically for George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott and Zach Galifianakis, some of the actors publicly stated their confusion in Reitman's assertion, if only because they knew he was meeting with other actors all along including his choice to fill his last lead role with Ellen Page (who starred in Reitman's previous film Juno) for the part that Kendrick ultimately played. On the part played by Farmiga, he cited her ability to walk {{a fine line between}} aggressiveness and femininity. On Kendrick, Reitman cited that he was inspired by her performance in Rocket Science. On Clooney, he said, [...] "If you're going to make a movie about a guy who fires people for a living and you <b>still</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> like him, that actor better be damn charming and I don't think there's a more charming actor alive than George Clooney. I was very lucky he said yes." [...] Reitman said, on the B.S. Report with Bill Simmons, that he considered Steve Martin for the part if Clooney declined the role.

500|$|In December 2008 it was {{announced}} that the show's creators had decided to kill the character off. It was confirmed that Jenny would still appear throughout the season in a [...] "flashback" [...] format. The first episode of the final season starts with Jenny's murder. However the final series focuses on the events leading up to her death. Chaiken revealed that each episode would focus and tease with another motive. She described how it would play out, stating: [...] "There's one character {{at the beginning of each}} show who comes forward with the motive of the moment. This would be my reason for killing Jenny." [...] The storyline was described as a [...] "sub-plot" [...] which would define the final season, but not [...] "overpower" [...] it. However, when the final episode aired there was no reveal to who killed Jenny. Showtime released a mini-series titled [...] "Interrogation Tapes" [...] online, via the official website.

Kate Aurthur of Los Angeles Times questioned if viewers would <b>still</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> watch the season after Jenny is killed. New York later gave a large amount of praise to Jenny commenting: [...] "Jenny Schecter is The L Word, and the death of her is the death of the show."
