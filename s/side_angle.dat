500|$|Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game bearing {{little resemblance to}} the first game in The Legend of Zelda series or later games in the series. The Adventure of Link features side-scrolling areas within a larger top-down world map rather than the exclusively top-down perspective of the previous title. The side-scrolling gameplay and experience system are similar to features of the Castlevania series, especially [...] (also released for the Family Computer's Disk System peripheral in 1987). The game incorporates a strategic combat system, a proximity continue system based on lives, an experience points (EXP) system, magic spells, and more interaction with non-player characters (NPCs). Apart from the non-canonical CD-i The Legend of Zelda games, , no other game in the series includes a life feature. The <b>side</b> <b>angle</b> was used again in [...] and the other Game Boy entries, but was not the main angle in those games, which relied primarily on the top-down view.|$|E

When new German tanks types with thicker armour began appearing in mid-1942, the T-34's 76.2mm cannon had to fire at their flanks to assure penetration. As a result, the T-34 was upgraded to the T-34-85 model. This model, with its 85mm (3.35in) ZiS gun, provided greatly increased firepower compared to the previous T-34's 76.2mm gun. The 85mm gun could penetrate the turret front of a Tiger I tank from [...] and the driver's front plate from [...] at the <b>side</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 degrees, and the larger turret enabled the addition of another crew member, allowing the roles of commander and gunner to be separated and increasing the rate of fire and overall effectiveness. Against the frontal armour of the Panther at 30 degree sidewards, the T-34-85 could not penetrate the non-mantlet of its turret at , meaning that even upgraded models of the T-34 usually needed tungsten rounds or had to flank a Panther to destroy it.|$|E

2500|$|The {{painting}} was created [...] between 1548 and 1549 {{and was a}} companion piece to Tintoretto's Last Supper, which still hangs at San Marcuola. Christ and St. Peter are at the far right of the image, an unusual position as Christ was typically placed in the centre of any paintings. This is explained by its original positioning in the church {{on the right side}} of the altar. Viewing the painting from a <b>side</b> <b>angle</b> allows the perspective of the tiled floor and the gaze of the disciples towards Jesus to emphasise his status as the main subject of the painting. On the far left of the painting is Judas Iscariot, clothed in bright red and noticeably isolated from the other figures of the painting. In the middle of the work are the rest of the disciples gathered around the table that was the site of the supper. They are depicted somewhat humorously as they strive to pull off their stockings. In the background there is a portal above Jesus that opens up to a room where the last supper takes place. The opening to the left shows buildings with elaborate and fantastic architecture. The architecture is based closely on designs by Sebastiano Serlio.|$|E

40|$|Vehicle <b>side</b> slip <b>angle</b> is a {{critical}} variable used in car safety systems like Electronic Stability Control. Due to the practical difficulty in direct measurement of <b>side</b> slip <b>angle,</b> accurate estimation of vehicle <b>side</b> slip <b>angle</b> using available signals is becoming important. This paper presents a novel algorithm for estimating the <b>side</b> slip <b>angle</b> of a vehicle in real time using inertial motion sensors. The algorithm uses a J 48 decision tree classifier to assist the Extended Kaiman Filter (EKF) predictions of the vehicle <b>side</b> slip <b>angle.</b> The decision tree classifies the inertial data into classes based on the condition the slip angle {{is expected to be}} in. Using the class information asserted by the classifier, the error covariance parameter of the EKF is adjusted to compensate for changes in disturbances and nonlinearities. The results show that the decision tree assisted EKF technique presented in this paper is capable of predicting the slip angle with sound accuracy using inertial motion data...|$|R

For the zero <b>side</b> slip <b>angle</b> case the surprising aspect of the flow is the non-uniform low velocity regions below the canopy that correspond to the separation bubbles, also a thick boundary layer follows {{all the way to}} the trailing edge. The lift coefficient increases linearly with the angle of attack up to 12 ?? with the lift curve slope of 0. 0302 (per deg) and zero lift angle of attack of - 4. 3 ??. The lowest drag coefficient occurs at an angle of attack range of 0 ?? to 2 ??. The largest lift-to-drag ratio is achieved at 10 ?? angle of attack.

And the application of soft computing technology has provided a feasible and accuracy and effective way for the estimator design in vehicle control system. The realization of state estimation based on soft computing technology provides a theoretical basis on soft computing applied to vehicle stability control system.
