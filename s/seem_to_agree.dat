All <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> on his graduation from William and Mary in 1806 and {{admission to the}} bar in 1807. Sources disagree on matriculation and graduation dates, as well as Crittenden's age and the duration of his studies at the other institutions.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{consensus}} regarding the exact import of the inscription, scholars <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> that its language is some form of Gothic and that the intent behind it was religious. Taylor interprets the inscription as being clearly pagan in nature and indicative {{of the existence of}} a temple to which the ring was a votive offering. He derives his date for the burial (210 to 250) {{from the fact that the}} Christianizing of the Goths along the Danube is generally considered to have been almost complete within a few generations after their having arrived there in 238. Though paganism among the Goths did survive the initial conversion phase of 250 to 300 - as the martyring of the converted Christian Goths Wereka, Batwin (370) and Sabbas (372) at the hands of the indigenously pagan Goths (in the latter case Athanaric) shows - it was weakened considerably in the following years, and the likelihood of such a deposit being made would have been greatly diminished.|$|E

25|$|Thus, the {{relationship}} between aprioricity, necessity, and analyticity {{is not easy to}} discern. However, most philosophers at least <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> that while the various distinctions may overlap, the notions are clearly not identical: the a priori/a posteriori distinction is epistemological, the analytic/synthetic distinction is linguistic, and the necessary/contingent distinction is metaphysical.|$|E
25|$|Adam's {{account is}} thus {{not seen as}} entirely reliable; the claimed 14-years' exile of Sweyn to Scotland does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> with Sweyn's {{building}} churches in Denmark throughout the same period, including the churches in Lund and Roskilde. According to Adam, Sweyn was punished by God for leading the uprising which led to king Harald's death, and had to spend fourteen years abroad (i.e. 9861000). The historicity of this exile, or its duration, is uncertain. Adam purports that Sweyn was shunned by all those with whom he sought refuge, but was finally allowed to live {{for a while in}} Scotland. Adam also suggests that Sweyn in his youth lived among heathens, and only achieved success as a ruler after accepting Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authorities}} also {{equate the}} town named Menapia (or Manapia) as Wexford town – others place it further {{north along the}} east coast, roughly near Wicklow town. A river called the Modonnu(s), whose estuary is near Menapia, is often {{said to be the}} Slaney – others think it is the Avoka river. It is because the Slaney is the only major river in the south-east that many as a result think that it is the Modonnu(s) river, thereby making Menapia equal to Wexford town (this theory only seems to work if Hook Head is made the Sacred Cape). Most authorities <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> that Menapia is not Wexford, but is a town located further north along the coast. However, this is not certain.|$|E

25|$|Most {{accounts}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> that {{at least}} three mob members were wounded by Smith's gunfire, {{but there is no}} other evidence that any of them died as a result. John Wills was shot in the arm, William Voras was shot in the shoulder, and William Gallaher was shot in the face. Others claimed that a fourth unnamed man was also wounded. Wills, Voras, Gallaher, and a Mr. Allen (possibly the fourth man) were all indicted for the murder of the Smiths. Wills, Voras, and Gallaher, perhaps conscious that their wounds could prove that they were involved in the mob, fled the county after being indicted and were never brought to trial. Apart from Taylor's report of what he had heard, {{there is no evidence that}} Wills, Voras, Gallaher, or Allen died from their wounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{assumption}} of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions {{of what is}} aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> {{in at least one}} point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but {{they do not have to}} do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the human condition; that is, what it is to be human.|$|E

500|$|The {{activities}} of Attarsiya are {{recorded in the}} Hittite archives, in particular in the Indictment of Madduwata.

This makes Attarsiya the first known Achaean leader, but his exact authority inside the Achaean world remains unclear. The Hittite descriptions <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> that he was a local Achaean ruler in western Anatolia, rather than a High king of all the Achaeans.|$|E
500|$|Many dog writers {{after the}} early 19th century <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> {{that there were}} two {{varieties}} of terrier existing in Britain at the time—a rough-haired so-called Scotch Terrier and a smooth-haired English Terrier. Thomas Brown, in his Biological Sketches and Authentic Anecdotes of Dogs (1829), states that [...] "the Scotch terrier is certainly the purest in point of breed and the (smooth) English seems to have been produced by a cross from him". [...] Brown went on to describe the Scotch Terrier as [...] "low in stature, with a strong muscular body, short stout legs, a head large in proportion to the body" [...] and was [...] "generally of a sandy colour or black" [...] with a [...] "long, matted and hard" [...] coat. [...] Although the Scotch Terrier described here is more generic than specific to a breed, it asserts the existence of a small, hard, rough-coated terrier developed for hunting small game in the Scottish Highlands in the early 19th century; a description that shares characteristics with what was once known as the Aberdeen Terrier and is today known as the Scottish Terrier. In addition, the paintings of Sir Edwin Landseer and an 1835 lithograph entitled [...] "Scottish Terriers at Work on a Cairn in the West Highlands" [...] both depict Scottie type terriers very similar to those described in the first Scottish Terrier Standard.|$|E

2500|$|Many Leibniz {{scholars}} {{writing in}} English <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> {{that he intended}} his characteristica universalis or [...] "universal character" [...] to {{be a form of}} pasigraphy, or ideographic language. This was to be based on a rationalised version of the 'principles' of Chinese characters, as Europeans understood these characters in the seventeenth century. From this perspective it is common to find the characteristica universalis associated with contemporary universal language projects like Esperanto, auxiliary languages like Interlingua, and formal logic projects like Frege's Begriffsschrift. The global expansion of European commerce in Leibniz's time provided mercantilist motivations for a universal language of trade so that traders could communicate with any natural language.|$|E
2500|$|The four tallest {{buildings}} {{in the area are}} located in downtown Minneapolis. The first skyscraper built west of the Mississippi in 1929 was the Foshay Tower. Today there is some contention over exactly which building is the tallest—most Minnesotans would immediately think of the IDS Center if queried on the point, although most sources <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> that Capella Tower is slightly taller. But in early 2005, {{it was found that the}} IDS Center is taller by a [...] washroom garage on top, which brings its total height to 792 feet (241 m). Capella Tower and the Wells Fargo Center only differ in height by a foot or two, a rather negligible amount.|$|E
