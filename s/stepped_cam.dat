50|$|Leica 1 cam, 2 cam, 3 cam, & R <b>stepped</b> <b>cam</b> lenses may {{be fitted}} with ROM {{contacts}} but as this entails {{removal of the}} original sloped cams they would then be incompatible with the original Leicaflex cameras. This was the first break in on-going compatibility of Leica reflex lenses.|$|E
5000|$|The Leicaflex {{camera lenses}} had either {{one or two}} sloping cams for {{aperture}} connection. The R3 replaced these with a single [...] "stepped cam" [...] conveying, in addition, the maximum aperture. From then on most lenses were made with all three cams but a few, especially those supplied with R cameras, had only the third <b>stepped</b> <b>cam</b> and were marked [...] "Leica R Only". These lenses had a very small modification to the original bayonet {{making it impossible to}} mount them on earlier cameras.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{allosteric}} inhibitors of PEP carboxylase are the carboxylic acids malate (weak) and aspartate (strong). Since malate {{is formed}} in the next <b>step</b> of the <b>CAM</b> and [...] cycles after PEP carboxylase catalyses the condensation of CO2 and PEP to oxaloacetate, this works as a feedback inhibition pathway. Oxaloacetate and aspartate are easily inter-convertible through a transaminase mechanism; thus high concentrations of aspartate are also a pathway of feedback inhibition of PEP carboxylase.|$|R
50|$|CAM {{software}} generally {{creates a}} tool path without considering any mechanics process. These causes risk of tool damage, tool deflection and errors on surface finish. By minimizing the forces we can increase tool life. Different optimization method {{can be used}} considering process parameters like feed rate, spindle speed, steps, tool diameter, magnitude and preset maximum force. The optimization can be done for minimum machining time, minimum tool travel, minimum production cost or for good surface finish. Efficiency of surface machined is also considered by maximum scallop height and by gouging. Gouging are {{the main reason for}} discrepancies of surface accuracy and texture specification. It also causes damage to part,s surface and machine tool. Scallop height tolerance help us in measuring the quality of free-form surface. Selection of proper topology result in minimum path length. In CAM software choosing NURBS to create surface is considered to be good method for presenting surface as it is accepted by both IGES and <b>STEP</b> files of <b>CAM</b> software.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} established in this laboratory that sera from CBA mice made tolerant to A/Jax skin grafts (neonatally induced tolerance) were able to enhance the growth of A/Jax tumors grafted on otherwise untreated CBA mice. This property was specifically removed by incubation with A cells (and not by CBA cells). The sera included those from highly tolerant mice, even taken before skin grafting, and the criteria for tolerance were severe, skin grafts in perfect state 100 days after grafting (1, 2). These and other data demonstrated the state of immune reactivity of lymphoid tissue from tolerant animals toward tolerated cells (1 - 4) {{as well as the}} establishment of a state indistinguishable from that of immunological tolerance through immunological facilitation enhancement in the graft-versu 3 -host situation (5 - 9). These results confirmed our views according to which immunological facilitation (the basis for the mechanisms of immunological enhancement) is also the basis for the mechanism of immunological tolerance of living cells (4, 10), implying an active immune reaction followed by an antibody mediation of some crucial <b>step.</b> Further confirmation <b>cam...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background. Use of {{complementary}} {{and alternative}} medicine (CAM) by children with cancer is high; however, pediatric best cases are rare. Objectives. To investigate whether best cases exist in pediatric oncology using a three-phase approach and to compare our methods with other such programs. Methods. In phase I, Children’s Oncology Group (COG) oncologists were approached via email {{and asked to}} recall patients who were (i) under 18 when diagnosed with cancer, (ii) diagnosed between 1990 and 2006, (iii) had unexpectedly positive clinical outcome, and (iv) reported using CAM during or after cancer treatment. Phase II involved partnering with CAM research networks; patients who were self-identified as best cases were asked to submit reports completed in conjunction with their oncologists. Phase III extended this partnership to 200 CAM associations and training organizations. Results. In phase I, ten cases from three COG sites were submitted, and most involved use of traditional Chinese medicine to improve quality of life. Phases II and III did not yield further cases. Conclusion. Identification of best cases has been suggested as an important <b>step</b> in guiding <b>CAM</b> research. The CARE Best Case Series Program had limited success in identifying pediatric cases despite the three approaches we used...|$|R
40|$|STEP-NC is a {{new data}} {{standard}} for CNC machining that combines product and process information. The new standard extends the CAD geometry and tolerance data defined by <b>STEP</b> to include <b>CAM</b> tool path data, process data, cutting tool data and volume removal data [1, 2]. The new data is an enabler for new intelligent applications on the CNC control. In this paper we describe the new standard and its applications. In order to meet different business cases, the new standard is divided into conformance classes. The lowest conformance class enables tool path interoperability. The second conformance class contains conditional programming constructs for closed loop programming. The third includes CAM process data and enables CAM to CAM data exchange. The fourth includes CAD tolerance information and enables quality control applications on the CNC. STEP-NC has been extensively tested by industry in pilot projects. In {{the first round of}} testing, CNC data was made on four different CAM systems and machined on two different five axis controls: one for a AB tool tilt machine and the other for a five axis BC table tilt machine. In the second round of testing, closed loop machining wa...|$|R

Adaptive tests however typically require very large samples, and pseudo-Gaussian tests–namely, tests that are locally and asymptotically optimal at Gaussian densities while remaining valid under a much broader class of distributions–in general are preferable. We therefore construct two pseudo-Gaussian modifications of the Gaussian version ϕN(n) of the optimal test ϕf(n). The first one, ϕN∗(n), is valid under the class of homokurtic m-tuples f, while the validity of the second, ϕN†(n), extends to the heterokurtic ones, that is, to arbitrary m-tuples of elliptical distributions with finite fourth-order moments. We moreover show that these tests are asymptotically equivalent to modified Wald tests recently proposed by Schott [J. R. Schott, Some tests for the equality of covariance matrices, Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference 94 (2001) 25 – 36]. This settles the optimality properties of the latter. Our results however are much more informative than Schott’s. They also allow for computing local powers, and for an ANOVA-type decomposition of the test statistics into two mutually independent parts providing tests against subalternatives of scale and shape heterogeneity, respectively, thus supplying additional insight into the reasons why rejection occurs.

Matsumoto, The effects of nonnormality on asymptotic distributions of some likelihood ratio criteria for testing covariance structures under normal assumption, Journal of Multivariate Analysis 96 (2005) 237 – 264], we further show why another approach, based on bootstrapped critical values of the Gaussian MLRT statistic, although producing asymptotically valid pseudo-Gaussian tests, is highly unsatisfactory in this context. We also develop optimal pseudo-Gaussian tests for scale homogeneity and for shape homogeneity, based on the same methodology.
