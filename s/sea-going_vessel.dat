60|$|A {{few weeks}} {{previously}} to the Sunday in question, a <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessel,</b> inward bound, had {{brought up in}} Gardiner's Bay, which is a usual anchorage {{for all sorts of}} craft. A worn-out and battered seaman had been put ashore on Oyster Pond, by a boat from this vessel, which sailed to the westward soon after, proceeding most probably to New York. The stranger was not only well advanced in life, but he was obviously wasting away with disease.|$|E
60|$|Such {{is a brief}} {{outline of}} the {{explanations}} that the two recovered seamen made to their former officer. In return, the governor as briefly related to them {{the manner in which}} the ship had been saved, and the history of the colony down to that moment. When both tales had been told, a consultation on the subject of future proceedings took place, quite as a matter of course. Brown, and his companion, though delighted to meet their old shipmates, were greatly disappointed in not finding a <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessel</b> ready to receive them. They did not scruple to say that had they known the actual state of things on the Reef, they would not have left the savages, but trusted to being of more service even to their natural friends, by continuing with Waally, in their former relation, than by taking the step they had. Repentance, or regrets, however, came too late; and now they were fairly in for it, neither expressed any other determination than to stand by the service into which they had just entered, honestly, if not quite as gladly as they had anticipated.|$|E
60|$|Within the bay {{and over}} the restful pueblo still dwelt the golden haze of its {{perpetual}} summer; the two towers of the old Mission church seemed to dissolve softly into the mellow upper twilight, and the undulating valleys rolled their green waves up to the wooded heights of San Antonio, that still smiled down upon the arid, pallid desert. But although Nature had not changed {{in the months that}} had passed since the advent of the Excelsior, there appeared some strange mutations in the town and its inhabitants. On the beach below the Presidio was the unfinished skeleton of a small <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessel</b> on rude stocks; on the plaza rose the framed walls and roofless rafters of a wooden building; near the Embarcadero was the tall adobe chimney of some inchoate manufactory whose walls had half risen from their foundations; but all of these objects had evidently succumbed to the drowsy influence of the climate, and already had taken the appearances of later and less picturesque ruins of the past. There were singular innovations in the costumes: one or two umbrellas, used as sunshades, were seen upon the square; a few small chip hats had taken the place of the stiff sombreros, with an occasional tall white beaver; while linen coat and nankeen trousers had, at times, usurped the short velvet jacket and loose calzas of the national costume.|$|E
40|$|I have {{clarified}} each of {{the following}} points in regard to the “sea-going vessels” that composed the basis of sea activity and cultural interaction in the Ryukyu Kingdom during the Old Ryukyu period. (1) The first <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> of Ryukyu were the Jigo-sen vessel(s) with identifi cation numbers that were built and registered during the Ming Dynasty. It can be said that the growth that is visible in the scale of the <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> {{in the middle of the}} 15 th century and then their miniaturization in the first part of the 16 th century are phenomena that both indicate the uniqueness of Ryukyu. (2) The Han’ in Kango tally that was issued along with the dispatch of Ryukyu <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> is something that runs through the East Asian sea region during that age. Furthermore, by tracing back those numbers, I have presented the concrete circumstances behind the dispatch of Ryukyu <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels.</b> (3) Ryukyu <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> were named in the respective fashions of China, Japan, and Ryukyu and their operating organizations were diverted to the Hiki land-based organizations, which had a major influence on the establishment of the system of governance in the Ryukyu Kingdom...|$|R

6000|$|The {{name of the}} prize-brig was the Susan, though I forget {{from what}} small eastern port she hailed. She was of about two hundred tons burthen, but must have-been old and rotten. Tibbets was master, and Wilson was chief-mate. I shipped {{as a sort of}} second-mate, keeping a watch, though I lived forward at my own request. We must have sailed about January, 1818, bound to Belfast. There were {{fourteen}} of us, altogether, on board, most of us down-easters. Our run off the coast was with a strong north-west gale, which compelled us to heave-to, the sea being too high for scudding. Finding that the vessel laboured very much, however, and leaked badly, we kept off again, and scudded {{for the rest of the}} blow. On the whole, we got out of this difficulty pretty well. We got but two observations the whole passage, but in the afternoon of the twenty-third day out, we made the coast of Ireland, close aboard, in thick weather; the wind directly on shore, blowing a gale. The brig was under close-reefed topsails, running free, at the time, and we found it necessary to haul up. We now discovered the defects of old canvass and old rigging, splitting the fore-topsail, foresail, and fore-topmast-staysail, besides carrying away sheets, &c. We succeeded in hauling up the foresail, however, and I went upon the yard and mended it, after a fashion. It was now nearly night, and it blew in a way [...] "to need two men to hold one man's hair on his head." [...] I cannot say I thought much of our situation, my principal concern being to get below, with some warm, dry clothes on. We saw nothing of the land after the first half-hour, but at midnight we wore ship, and came up on the larboard tack. The brig had hardly got round before the fore-tack went, and the foresail split into ribands. We let the sail blow from the yard. By this time, things began to look very serious, though, for some reason, I felt no great alarm. The case was different with Tibbets and Wilson, who were uneasy about Cape Clear. I had had a bit of a spat with them about waring, believing, myself, that we should have gone clear of the Cape, on the starboard tack. This prevented them saying much to me, and we had little communication with each other that night. To own the truth, I was sorry I had shipped in such a craft. Her owners were too poor to give a <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessel</b> a proper outfit, and they were too near my own level to create respect.|$|E

40|$|In {{the age of}} {{continually}} developing {{satellite navigation}} practically every ship is equipped with GPS receivers, providing the coordinates of her position. However, relying solely on the navigational data from one autonomous receiver the navigator may expect that a given position is burdened with significant errors or that the position data will be lost. This results from the shortcoming of GPS systems which are susceptible to disturbances affecting their operation. One method to substantially reduce such risk is a navigational system that makes use {{of a number of}} sources for accurate position determination. The obtained data are processed, which involves data integration and filtration in order to further diminish measurement errors. One possible solution is the application of a system based on an algorithm of multi-sensor navigational data fusion using a Kalman filter. After {{a brief description of the}} algorithm, this article presents some results of the fusion of data from parallel position measurements, where the data come from two mobile GPS receivers. The said solution is intended to be implemented in a navigational decision support system on board a <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessel...</b>|$|E

In this paper we focus on some of the design challenges faced as well as the construction techniques used to build the vessel. Also presented are findings and comments on the vessel performance under sail over a two-week period on the Red Sea, where a wide variety of sea and wind conditions were encountered.

40|$|Abstract Marine litter is {{observed}} along shorelines, pelagic, benthic marine and lake systems {{all around the}} globe. On beaches, litter creates aesthetic and related economic problems because a clean beach {{is one of the}} most important characteristics of a seaside resort required by visitors. Litter can reach the marine environment from marine or land activities but it is estimated that 80 % originates from land-based sources. The marine-based sources of litter include all types of <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessel</b> and offshore installations, the most abundant plastic debris in the oceans being derelict (lost or improperly discarded) fishing gear. Most of marine litter is composed by plastics due to their greater durability and persistence, combined with plastic rising production and low rates of recovery. Special importance is linked to microplastics because their ubiquity, persistence, mechanical effects on biota and the ecosystem because of ingestion by organisms and their toxic potential. As plastics degrade they can release toxic chemicals initially incorporated during their manufacturing or persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals sorbed to their surfaces in the environment. Such toxins can disrupt endocrine functions and cause harmful reproductive and developmental effects in aquatic animals.

40|$|Air {{quality policy}} has {{focussed}} on land-based emissions for decades. In recent years, {{it has become}} increasingly clear that emissions from <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> can no longer be ignored. There is a growing need for detailed emission inventories to evaluate the impact of this transport mode on air quality and health. In this paper we present MOPSEA, an activity-based emission model to determine emissions from <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels.</b> The model considers shipping activities of <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> on Belgian territory, combined with individual vessel characteristics. We apply this model to study the effects of recent international efforts to reduce emissions from <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessels</b> in Belgian territorial waters for the current fleet and for two scenarios up to 2010. The emission model for Belgium, based on different vessel operating areas, reveals that most maritime emissions from the main engines will increase. CO 2 emissions will increase by 2 – 9 % over the 2004 – 2010 period due to an increase in shipping activity. NO X emissions are projected to rise between 1 % and 8 % because the increase in activity offsets the reductions from the international maritime organisation (IMO) and European regulations. In contrast, SO 2 emissions will decrease by at least 50 % in 6 years time. The switch of auxiliaries from heavy fuel oil to diesel oil at berth results in a large emission reduction (33 %) for PM and small reductions for CO 2, NO X, CO and HC (4 – 5 %). The choice between a bottom-up versus top-down approach can have important implications for the allocation of maritime emissions. The MOPSEA bottom-up model allocates only 0. 7  Mton CO 2 to Belgium, compared to 24. 2  Mton CO 2 based on bunker fuel inventories...|$|R

40|$|The Breeddiep is a {{connecting}} waterway {{between the}} Nieuwe Waterweg and Calandkanaal, {{in the west}} of the Rotterdam port area. It is predominantly used by inland vessels travelling from the hinterland to the Maasvlakte, in the utmost west part of the port. It is a narrow waterway in a dynamic environment with respect to tidal and fluvial currents. Because of this, the manoeuvres of the ships are difficult and time consuming. In the future, the number and size of the inland vessels will increase and as a result the current Breeddiep will not suffice anymore. In this project the feasibility of the possibilities of redesigning the Breeddiep were studied, as to enable for handling the increased traffic of the future. This was achieved by doing two- and three-dimensional flow studies for different design alternatives with the flow models WAQUA and TRIWAQ. In the following phase, the most promising results were used as input for fast-time manoeuvring simulations to determine the nautical feasibility of a new design. The alternative used in the nautical study comprised of a new waterway just west of the present Breeddiep, which stayed as it is. The results appeared to be quite promising. For ships that currently make frequent use of the Breeddiep, the manoeuvre will become easier and safer. In most cases, vessels of increased size, that are not able to use the present Breeddiep, are able to use the newly designed opening. Furthermore, large <b>sea-going</b> <b>vessel</b> that pass by the Breeddiep, are not significantly influenced by the increased flow at the Calandkanaal. The results of this study have not led to an optimised design for a new Breeddiep. Nevertheless, recommendations can be done for the follow-up of the study. Since all traffic will be safer through a new Breeddiep it is advisable to study the consequences of closing the present Breeddiep. Furthermore, it is recommended to carry out full-mission real-time simulation for the manoeuvres that were found to be critical in this study. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
