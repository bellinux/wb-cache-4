25|$|While {{there is}} no {{complete}} cure for stuttering, several treatment options exist that help individuals to better control their speech. Many of the available treatments focus on learning strategies to minimize stuttering through <b>speed</b> <b>reduction,</b> breathing regulation, and gradual progression from single-syllable responses to longer words, and eventually more complex sentences. Furthermore, some stuttering therapies help to address the anxiety that is often elicited {{as a result of}} stuttering, and consequently exacerbates stuttering symptoms. This method of treatment is referred to as a comprehensive approach, in which the main emphasis of treatment is directed toward improving the speaker's attitudes toward communication and minimizing the negative impact stuttering can have on the speaker's life. Treatment from a qualified S-LP can benefit people who stutter of any age.|$|E
25|$|The {{programming}} of the {{stored program}} for ENIAC {{was done by}} Betty Jennings, Clippinger and Adele Goldstine. It was first demonstrated as a stored-program computer on September 16, 1948, running a program by Adele Goldstine for John von Neumann. This modification reduced the speed of ENIAC {{by a factor of}} six and eliminated the ability of parallel computation, but as it also reduced the reprogramming time to hours instead of days, it was considered well worth the loss of performance. Also analysis had shown that due to differences between the electronic speed of computation and the electromechanical speed of input/output, almost any real-world problem was completely I/O bound, even without making use of the original machine's parallelism. Most computations would still be I/O bound, even after the <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> imposed by this modification.|$|E
30|$|It seems a goal based regulation, not {{specifying the}} means. However, {{a lack of}} real means will result in <b>speed</b> <b>reductions</b> and {{actually}} changing the regulation into a prescriptive one. Also the relative simplicity of the correction factors for off standard main dimensions and speed in comparison to power prediction methods like Holtrop & Mennen (Holtrop & Mennen, 1984), still used today in the conceptual design phase, could result in undesirable <b>speed</b> <b>reductions</b> in some off standard designs typical for RoRo carriers.

25|$|In {{semaphore}} areas, junctions are signalled using {{a series}} of between 2 and 5 stop signal arms on one bracket or gantry, known as splitting signals. Each arm (usually) has its own post ("doll") on the bracket, and each arm applies to one possible route. The relative heights of the dolls usually convey some information about the lines to which they apply, {{although there is no}} definite standard. In some cases, the tallest doll applies to the highest-speed route; in others, it applies to what the railway considered the most important route. Traditionally, splitting distant signals would be provided – {{a series of}} side-by-side distant signals telling the driver which doll on the following stop signal was off; but practice since the 1920s has erred towards providing just one distant which is locked at caution if a large <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> is necessary. Drivers of trains must know which signal arm applies to which route, and the speed limit on that route; accidents have resulted from drivers either mis-reading splitting signals or forgetting speed restrictions, and consequently approaching junctions too fast.|$|E

2500|$|Since Wankel engines {{operate at}} a {{relatively}} high rotational speed, at 6,000 rpm of output shaft, the Rotor makes only 2,000 turns. With relatively low torque, propeller driven aircraft must use a propeller <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> unit to maintain propellers within the designed speed range. Experimental aircraft with Wankel engines use propeller <b>speed</b> <b>reduction</b> units, for instance the MidWest twin-rotor engine has a 2.95:1 reduction gearbox. [...] The rotational shaft speed of a Wankel engine is high compared to reciprocating piston designs. Only the eccentric shaft spins fast, while the rotors turn at exactly one-third of the shaft speed. If the shaft is spinning at 7,500 rpm, the rotors are turning at a much slower 2,500 rpm.|$|E

40|$|CO 2 {{emissions}} from maritime transport represent {{a significant part}} of total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. According to the International Maritime Organization (Second IMO GHG study, 2009), maritime transport emitted 1046 million tons (all tons are metric) of CO 2 in 2007, representing 3. 3 % of the world's total CO 2 emissions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is currently debating both technical and market-based measures for reducing greenhouse gas {{emissions from}} shipping. This paper presents investigations on the effects of <b>speed</b> <b>reductions</b> on the direct emissions and costs of maritime transport, for which the selection of ship classes was made to facilitate an aggregated representation of the world fleet. The results show that there is a substantial potential for reducing CO 2 emissions in shipping. Emissions can be reduced by 19 % with a negative abatement cost (cost minimization) and by 28 % at a zero abatement cost. Since these emission reductions are based purely on lower speeds, they can in part be performed now. Maritime transport <b>Speed</b> <b>reductions</b> Greenhouse gas emissions...|$|R
