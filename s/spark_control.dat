40|$|In {{order to}} reduce fuel cost and CO 2 emissions, modern spark {{ignition}} (SI) engines need to lower {{as much as possible}} fuel consumption. A crucial factor for efficiency improvement is represented by the combustion phase, which in an SI engine is controlled acting on the spark advance. This fundamental engine parameter is currently controlled in an open-loop by means of maps stored in the electronic control unit (ECU) memory: such kind of control, however, does not allow running the engine always at its best performance, since optimal combustion phase depends on many variables, like ambient conditions, fuel quality, engine aging, and wear, etc. A better choice would be represented by a closed-loop <b>spark</b> timing <b>control,</b> which may be pursued by means of combustion phase indicators, i. e., parameters mostly derived from in-cylinder pressure analysis that assume fixed reference values when the combustion phase is optimal. As documented in literature, the use of combustion phase indicators allows the determination of the best spark advance, apart from any variable or boundary condition. The implementation of a feedback <b>spark</b> timing <b>control,</b> based on the use of these combustion phase indicators, would ensure the minimum fuel consumption in every possible condition. Despite the presence of many literature references on the use combustion phase indicators, {{there is no evidence of}} any experimental comparison on the performance obtainable, in terms of both control accuracy and transient response, by the use of such indicators in a <b>spark</b> timing feedback <b>control.</b> The author, hence, carried out a proper experimental campaign comparing the performances of a proportional-integral <b>spark</b> timing <b>control</b> based on the use of five different in-cylinder pressure derived indicators. The experiments were carried out on a bench test, equipped with a series production four cylinder spark ignition engine and an eddy current dynamometer, using two data acquisition (DAQ) systems for data acquisition and <b>spark</b> timing <b>control.</b> Pressure sampling was performed by means of a flush mounted piezoelectric pressure transducer with the resolution of one crank angle degree. The feedback control was compared to the conventional map based control in terms of response time, control stability, and control accuracy in three different kinds of tests: steady-state, step response, and transient operation. All the combustion phase indicators proved to be suitable for proportionalintegral feedback <b>spark</b> advance <b>control,</b> allowing fast and reliable control even in transient operations.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{considerations}} in designing intrinsically safe electronics devices: reducing or eliminating internal <b>sparking,</b> <b>controlling</b> component temperatures, and eliminating component spacing {{that would allow}} dust to short a circuit. Elimination of spark potential within components is accomplished by limiting the available energy in any given circuit and {{the system as a}} whole. Temperature, under certain fault conditions such as an internal short in a semiconductor device, becomes an issue as the temperature of a component can rise to a level that can ignite some explosive gasses, even in normal use. Safeguards, such as current limiting by resistors and fuses, must be employed to ensure that in no circumstance can a component reach a temperature that could cause autoignition of a combustible atmosphere. In the highly compact electronic devices used today PCB's often have component spacing that create the possibility of an arc between components if dust or other particulate matter works into the circuitry, thus component spacing, siting and isolation become important to the design.|$|R

The closed-loop version of ELB used an Oxygen sensor and a feedback carburetor, and was phased into production as emissions regulations grew more stringent starting in 1981, but open-loop ELB was used as late as 1990 in markets with lax emissions regulations, on vehicles such as the Mexican Chrysler Spirit.

40|$|This conference {{paper is}} Closed access. Controlled Auto Ignition (CAI) uses the {{internal}} {{energy of the}} compressed charge to auto-ignite the mixture. Using internal exhaust gas re-circulation (IEGR) as an indirect control method, CAI offers superior fuel economy and pollutant emission reductions. Practically, this can readily be achieved by a method of early exhaust valve closure and late inlet valve opening to trap a large quantity of exhaust gas residuals within the cylinder from one cycle to the next. Although the emission and fuel economy can be largely improved, the engine power output is limited to part-load conditions only. At high-load, conventional Spark Ignition (SI) is required. In this research, both SI and CAI and the transition between the two were investigated on a single-cylinder research engine equipped with Lotus’ Research Active Valve Train (AVT) System.

5000|$|Foot {{clutches}} with tank shifters were {{standard on}} American motorcycles such as Harley-Davidson and Indian {{up to the}} mid-20th century and many custom bikes today still employ this system. The system used by Harley-Davidson arranged the controls with the tank shifter {{on the left side}} of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the right hand and the shifter, spark contol and front brake operated by the left hand. The Harley-Davidson rocker clutch was operated with the left foot with the heel down position to disengage the clutch (with an over-center spring to hold the clutch disengaged) and the toe down position to engage it ("Toe-to-go"). The right foot operated the rear brake, as is the practice in modern times. Indian, meanwhile arranged things differently. On an Indian, the tank shifter was located on the right side of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the left hand and the shifter, <b>spark</b> <b>control</b> and front brake operated by the right hand. (Indian promoted their system to police departments saying that the officer could fire his service weapon with his right hand while riding) The Indian rocker clutch was also operated by the left foot, but the toe down position disengaged the clutch and the heel down position engaged it. Harley-Davidson introduced the hand clutch on the 1952 Panhead, and simultaneously on the K model, their all-new sport model. The transmissions of the foot shift and the hand shift models were different. The hand shift gear selector mechanism was referred to as the [...] "jockey top" [...] or [...] "jockey lid." [...] On this transmission, the gears were selected in a linear fashion with the selector arm moving further and further forward with each successive gear and the gear lever moved in a slotted gate on the side of the tank. When modified to operate as a [...] "jockey shifter," [...] The lever would be pushed back for 1st gear and then step by step more forward for each subsequent gear. The foot shift gear selector mechanism was referred to as the [...] "ratchet top". On this transmission, the gears were selected in a ratcheting motion, returning to its default, central position after each shift. When modified to operate with short, transmission mounted hand lever and a foot suicide clutch, this type of set-up was referred to as a [...] "slap shifter" [...] or [...] "slapper". In contrast to the jockey shifter, the slap shifter would always stay in one central position between shifts. Throughout the 50s and 60s on the Panheads and subsequent Shovelheads, foot clutches and hand clutches coexisted, with the hand clutch being progressively more popular over time. After foot clutches had all but disappeared from Harley-Davidson civilian models, the last holdout of foot clutches were the police models up to the early 70's, presumably because the police officers could use their 2-way radio with the left hand while clutching with their foot.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{components}} in an Electrostatic Precipitator (EP) for a spark {{and both the}} phenomenon and mechanism of a spark are elaborated and then the type of spark is classified by the condition of shortage between the discharge and collecting electrodes.
