40|$|PLC {{programming}} {{students are}} often limited to simulated systems or <b>soft</b> <b>PLCs,</b> because {{the high price}} of the hardware and the software licenses make it difficult for faculties to use real equipment for teaching. This paper describes the design and building of a PLC controlled self-balancing robot with CodeSys and Raspberry Pi as a low-cost demonstrator model that students can use as a base to interact with a real system. A first prototype has been developed, which can be used in the future to get students involved in beginner automation courses without having to build a system from scratch...|$|R
50|$|Barr Britvic <b>Soft</b> Drinks <b>plc</b> was a {{proposed}} company to be {{founded by the}} merger between two British soft drink manufacturers, A G Barr and Britvic. Former Britvic shareholders were to own 63 per cent of the combined entity, whilst Barr shareholders would have held 37 per cent. Measured by revenue, {{it would have been}} one of the largest soft drinks companies in Europe. The company would have had annual sales of more than £1.5 billion and would have employed around 4,300 staff.|$|R
50|$|Nichols plc, {{based in}} Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, England, {{is a company}} well known for its lead brand Vimto, a fruit {{flavoured}} cordial. The company can trace its roots back to the invention of Vimto, by John Noel Nichols in 1908. Today the company operates two types of businesses, firstly the sale of Vimto and other brands (such as Panda Pops, which Nichols acquired from Hall & Woodhouse in 2005) via supermarkets and associated outlets throughout the world and secondly its soft drink dispense operation in the UK. The soft drink operation is handled {{under the name of}} Cabana and is the UK's largest independent supplier of dispensed soft drinks. Due to its success of the Vimto <b>soft</b> drink, Nichols <b>plc</b> started selling Vimto chews and Vimto chew bars.|$|R

40|$|Manufacturing {{control systems}} are {{extremely}} hard {{to design and}} test. Testing Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) software in an on-line manufacturing setting can be costly, dangerous, and inefficient. The availability of a seamless transition between the real manufacturing process and a simulated manufacturing process on the one hand, and a real PLC and a <b>soft</b> <b>PLC</b> {{on the other hand}} might help to solve these problems. Using the Java-based object oriented simulation library DSOL (Distributed Simulation Object Library), a case study was conducted for a concrete floor manufacturer to see whether these problems could be overcome. The full simulation and hardware-in-the-loop tests with DSOL, with the Modbus middleware protocol, and with real and soft PLCs went fine, and showed the added value of the distributed, service-oriented paradigm on which DSOL is based. ...|$|E

This laboratory system is used for research and in teaching. A study {{of the principles of}} operation, setting up and examination of intelligent energy meters, <b>soft</b> starters and <b>PLC</b> has been made as knowledge of the relevant software products is necessary. This is of great importance because systems for remote monitoring and control of energy consumption, efficiency and proper operation of the controlled objects are very often used in different spheres of industry, in building automation, transport, electricity distribution network, etc. Their implementation in electric vehicles for remote monitoring and control on auxiliary machines is also possible and very useful.

40|$|Sponsoring {{organization}} Title and subtitle Hardware Simulation for Testing IEC 61131 - 3 (Hårdvarusimulering för testning av IEC 61131 - 3) Testing {{of control}} code written in IEC 61131 - 3 {{has long been}} a strenuous manual process. The focus in this master's thesis is on building a simulator of an Alfa Laval separator to enable testing of control code. In this particular case, the control code being tested is written and executed in a <b>soft</b> <b>PLC</b> called TwinCAT. The simulator for testing code is written in C#. When testing code, automated tests are preferred because it enables easy regression testing. For this purpose a testing tool using a customized script language has been developed. Testing with a simulator is also beneficial because errors can be found early in the development process, thus reducing the number of errors left to be found when testing on hardware. Comparison tests show that the simulator performs sufficiently well for testing of control code.
