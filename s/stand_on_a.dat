5|$|During the engagement, 12 militiamen {{were killed}} by Band warriors while making a <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> small hill. The {{remainder}} of the militia fled back to Dixon's Ferry. Citizens erected a monument in 1901 in Stillman Valley, Illinois commemorating the battle. A 2006 article corroborates that militia volunteer Abraham Lincoln {{was present at the}} battleground's burials; sources agree about little else. Investigation continues in the early 21st century about facts of the skirmish.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 the new Bicester {{cut-off line}} of the Great Western Railway Chiltern Main Line was routed {{directly}} through Wood Siding, but no interchange station was built. The GWR was to run in a cutting beneath the existing station; Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908 and 1910 to <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wide bridge above the GWR's line.|$|E
5|$|To {{the south}} of the tower is a range of {{buildings}} built against the thick, buttressed, 14th-century curtain wall. The great hall occupied the central part of this range, with the lord's private apartments of great chamber and solar in the block to the north, and kitchens to the south. The foundations of a rectangular building <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rocky mound within the Nether Bailey, tentatively identified as a chapel.|$|E

5|$|In 1910 the new Bicester {{cut-off line}} of the GWR Chiltern Main Line opened, {{allowing}} trains from London to Birmingham to bypass a long curve through Oxford. The new line was routed directly through Wood Siding, although no interchange station was built. The GWR ran in a cutting beneath the existing station; Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908–1910 to <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wide bridge above the GWR's line. The new line included the station named Brill and Ludgershall, which in reality was considerably further from Brill than the existing Brill station.|$|E
5|$|On 24 December {{the family}} moved to Versailles for two weeks during which, through a court connection, they were able to attend a royal dinner, where Wolfgang was {{reportedly}} allowed to kiss the hand of the Queen. At Versailles they also visited the famous courtesan Madame de Pompadour, then in the last months of her life"an extremely haughty woman who still ruled over everything", according to Leopold. In Nannerl's later recollections, Wolfgang was made to <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> chair to be examined by the Madame, who would not allow him to kiss her.|$|E

The knight's helmet indicates a municipality and the crown is that of King Edgar (referencing his coronation at the Abbey).

5|$|The video {{featured}} the physical discipline parkour, in which parkour artist Sébastien Foucan performed routines around the buildings of Tokyo. The video begins showing the Tokyo skyline and parkour artists standing on rooftops. As the spoken introduction starts, Madonna {{is shown in}} her wig dancing {{in front of a}} number of neon signs which contain the words Madonna and Jump in Japanese. The song continues with the dancers jumping from buildings and running through the lanes of the city. Madonna dances to the music and swivels around metallic rods in and around her, of the same design present in her tour. Before the final chorus, the dancers cease their parkour routines and <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lamppost.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the ruins}} of Castell y Bere still <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rocky outcrop, with {{protective}} ditches cut into the stone on {{the south and east}} sides. The entrance to the castle lies on the west side, where the barbican, probably built by Edward I, contains two gatetowers, overlooking the stone steps approaching the inner gate. Through the barbican is the castle courtyard, containing a large well and the remains of several internal buildings of uncertain date.|$|E
5|$|Innis got {{his first}} taste of {{university}} teaching at Chicago, where he delivered several introductory economics courses. One of his students was Mary Quayle, the woman he would marry in May 1921 when he was 26 and she 22. Together they had four children, Donald (1924), Mary (1927), Hugh (1930), and Anne (1933). Mary Quayle Innis was herself a notable economist and writer. Her book, An Economic History of Canada, was published in 1935. Her novel, <b>Stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Rainbow appeared in 1943. Her other books include Mrs. Simcoe's Diary (1965), The Clear Spirit: Canadian Women and Their Times (1966) and Unfold the Years (1949), {{a history of the}} Young Women's Christian Association. She also edited Harold Innis's posthumous Essays in Canadian Economic History (1956) and a 1972 reissue of his Empire and Communications.|$|E

5|$|The {{crowd of}} people {{assembled}} below the balcony generally consisted of soldiers, merchants, craft persons, peasants, and women and sick children. As the balcony was set high, the king would <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> platform so that people gathered below could reassure themselves that he was alive and that the empire was stable; even when the sovereign was ill. He {{felt that it was}} necessary to see them publicly {{at least once a day}} in order to maintain his control, and guard against immediate anarchy. It also had a symbolic purpose. During this time people might make personal requests directly to Akbar, or present him with petitions for some cause. Akbar, therefore, began appearing at the jharokha twice a day and would hear the complaints of the people who wished to speak to him. Sometimes, while the emperor gave his Jharokha Darshan, he would let out a thread down the jharokha so that people could tie their complaints and petitions seeking his attention and justice. It was an effective way of communication and information exchange process, which Badauni, a contemporary of Akbar noted Jharokha Darshan worked effectively under Akbar who spent about four and half hours regularly in such darshan. Akbar's paintings giving Jharokha Darshan are also popular.|$|E
5|$|Wood Siding {{initially}} had no {{facilities for}} passengers, {{not even a}} platform. In 1894 a low platform and small corrugated iron waiting room were built for passengers. As well as the passenger platform, a short siding led to a raised wooden platform, alongside the through line to Brill, which served both as a buffer stop for the siding, and as a loading platform for milk. The station was staffed by a single porter, responsible for opening the gates of a nearby level crossing and for loading and unloading freight (mainly milk); a small, unheated hut was provided for his use. While the original Aveling & Porter locomotive was slow and noisy and could be heard by the porter long before its arrival, later locomotives were quieter and quicker; a ladder was installed against a large oak for the porter to watch for oncoming trains. Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908–1910 to <b>stand</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wide bridge above the new Chiltern Main Line. Wood Siding {{was removed from the}} timetable by 1931, although trains continued to stop on request. While Wood Siding station was demolished shortly after closure, the abutments of the bridge which carried the station and sidings remain intact. The porter's hut survives as a nearby garden shed.|$|E
