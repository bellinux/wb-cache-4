5000|$|A90 is {{equipped}} with multiple plasma flat-screen television screens which are used to display up to 16 different types of information needed by supervisory, traffic management and controllers-in-charge ranging from ETMS to Weather. Although they can be set to display almost anything, they will usually be set {{to one of three}} things. Commonly, a map of the Northeast United States will be displayed that shows all traffic landing or departing at Boston or Boston Satellite fields. This allows the controllers to look up at the screen and quickly tell if there is a rush about to come. Also commonly displayed is the IDS5 display. This information is also shown on a small touch-screen above each controller's station. Also, commonly displayed above the Initial Departure sector is a live video feed from Boston Tower showing the departure <b>strip</b> <b>bay.</b> This camera system is used to satisfy the requirement for [...] "non-verbal rolling notification" [...] as required by FAAO 7110.65. What is displayed on each screen can be changed at one of the center console positions, which is controlled with a computer touch screen.|$|R
50|$|In the Melbourne {{suburb of}} Brighton, Palace {{operates}} 2 Cinemas within 10 minutes drive of each other, {{making it one}} of the only operators in Australia to own two indoor cinemas in the same suburb. Dendy Brighton, on Dendy Street, is more centralised in Brighton's main shopping strip, and therefore shows Commercial films. Brighton Bay, is in another smaller shopping <b>strip</b> on <b>Bay</b> Street, in North Brighton, and plays mostly arthouse films. The two cinemas will not show the same films (although this rule has been ignored on a few occasions, due to demand).|$|R

The houses below those streets front onto Oriental Parade which is defined as Oriental Bay. The old monastery is in Mount Victoria. Palliser Road is in Roseneath.|$|R
50|$|There {{are almost}} 50 small century-old seaside baches on the coastal <b>strip</b> between Hobsons <b>Bay</b> to the north, and Boulder Bay to the south. Some were cave baches, with Whare Moki being {{considered}} the oldest surviving example in NZ. Most of the baches were in 1995 or 2016 recognised as heritage assets by either Heritage NZ {{or by the}} Christchurch City Council under the resource management act.|$|R
50|$|Wyong Shire {{was located}} around the coastal lake system of Tuggerah Lake, Budgewoi Lake and Lake Munmorah. The area {{included}} a coastal <b>strip</b> from Bateau <b>Bay</b> to Budgewoi, some lakeside towns and residential areas, some inland towns on {{the coastal plain}} and a sparsely populated region to the west with the rural townships of Yarramalong, Dooralong, Jilliby, and regions of native bush surrounding Kulnura.|$|R
50|$|Border strip, {{otherwise}} known as border check or bay irrigation could {{be considered as a}} hybrid of level basin and furrow irrigation. The field is divided into a number of <b>bays</b> or <b>strips,</b> each <b>bay</b> is separated by raised earth check banks (borders). The bays are typically longer and narrower compared to basin irrigation and are orientated to align lengthwise with the slope of the field. Typical bay dimensions are between 10-70m wide and 100-700m long. The water is applied to the top end of the bay, which is usually constructed to facilitate free-flowing conditions at the downstream end. One common use of this technique includes the irrigation of pasture for dairy production.|$|R
50|$|Toodyay Fire Station was {{designed}} by architect Ken Duncan, {{a member of the}} Volunteer Fire Brigade, and was built in 1939. It is notable for its Art Deco facade. It is one of two single <b>bay</b> <b>Stripped</b> Classical fire stations built during the Western Australian Fire Brigades Board's 1930s building campaign. It is rendered in part and bricked to lower level, all painted. An extension to the side is in the same style.|$|R
25|$|During the 1942–1943 dry season, two {{operations}} were mounted. The {{first was a}} small scale offensive into the Arakan region of Burma. The Arakan is a coastal <b>strip</b> along the <b>Bay</b> of Bengal, crossed by numerous rivers. The First Arakan offensive largely failed due to difficulties of logistics, communications and command. The Japanese troops were also still assigned almost superhuman powers by their opponents. The second attack was much more controversial; that of the 77th Indian Infantry Brigade, {{better known as the}} Chindits.|$|R
50|$|The village overlooks Allonby Bay in the Solway Firth. The area {{is within}} the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and the {{historic}} county of Cumberland. Allonby, and the five-mile coastal <b>strip</b> of the <b>bay,</b> afford spectacular views across the Solway to the Galloway hills of southern Scotland. Both the South Saltpans beach and the West Winds beach were awarded the Blue flag rural beach award in 2005. The village {{is located on the}} 150 mi Cumbria Coastal Way long distance footpath.|$|R
50|$|Swansea can {{be roughly}} {{divided into four}} {{physical}} areas. To the north are the Lliw uplands which are mainly open moorland, reaching {{the foothills of the}} Black Mountain. To the west is the Gower Peninsula with its rural landscape dotted with small villages.

5000|$|Wicklow town forms a rough {{semicircle}} around Wicklow harbour. To {{the immediate}} north lies 'The Murrough', a popular grassy walking area beside the sea, {{and the eastern}} coastal strip. The Murrough {{is a place of}} growing commercial use, so much so that a road by-passing the town directly to the commercial part of the area commenced construction in 2008 and was completed in summer of 2010. The eastern coastal <b>strip</b> includes Wicklow <b>bay,</b> a crescent shaped stone beach approximately 10 km in length.|$|R
50|$|Musica {{got word}} that the bank had alerted federal {{authorities}} and proceeded to <b>strip</b> his <b>Bay</b> Ridge home of virtually everything of value. The Musica family fled to various cities on the East Coast before meeting in New Orleans. They got on a ship, intending to escape to Panama, but private detective William J. Burns was able to track them down by following a $12 steamer trunk Philip had bought at the Knickerbocker. Musica pleaded guilty {{in return for the}} dismissal of all charges against his family, claiming he'd been bilked by two European firms. Although the banks only recovered $70,000 of the $600,000 he'd swindled from them, he was able to curry favor with the authorities by informing on other inmates at The Tombs. Finally, in 1916, he was given a suspended sentence and released.|$|R
50|$|Previously, RTC {{planned to}} shorten The Deuce on the Strip {{from the current}} 9.3 miles to just the 5 miles of the <b>Strip</b> from Mandalay <b>Bay</b> Casino to Palace Station on Sahara Avenue. This {{would have been the}} first time in 45 years (including Las Vegas Transit System) that the main Strip {{corridor}} route had undergone a major route change and be shortened. However, {{the first week of the}} service change, the northern portion of the route was reinstated with buses continuing to serve the Downtown Transportation Center.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the early}} 1980s Minton has led regular, almost annual, wader study expeditions to north-west Australia {{to catch and}} study the waders that migrate to and through the coastal <b>strip</b> between Roebuck <b>Bay</b> near Broome, Eighty Mile Beach and Port Hedland in the {{southern}} section of the East Asian - Australasian Flyway. These expeditions, along with data collected in south-eastern Australia by the VWSG, have led to major governmental conservation initiatives through the Flyway, including the Japan Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (JAMBA), the China Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (CAMBA) and the East Asian - Australasian Shorebird Site Network. He has also been involved in several international wader study expeditions in North America, South America and Russia.|$|R
25|$|Upon {{reaching}} Darwin, McGinness and Gorham traveled back to Cloncurry {{to survey}} and build landing routes {{on the way}} there, while Fysh was to stay in Darwin and create suitable landing strips there and at Katherine. In a letter addressed to General Legge dated to 30 October 1919, Fysh rejected {{the use of the}} racecourse in Darwin, which was originally picked by Reginald Lloyd (the head of the first ground survey to find a suitable route for the aircraft), as the landing ground for the winning aircraft. He then suggested an alternate strip, locating one near Fannie Bay, to the north of Darwin. Shortly before the landing of the Smith brothers, the landing <b>strip</b> at Fannie <b>Bay</b> was completed at the cost of £A700.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{post office}} {{in the town of}} Canby, as Stapleton was then known, was {{established}} in 1895. Later, the Hamm brothers of Chicago, IL convinced the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N) to build a subsidiary line between Bay Minette and Foley. By 1905 this spur called the Bay Minette & Fort Morgan Railroad had penetrated the thirty-seven miles of dense Baldwin County pine forests with the town of Canby lying along the route. Shortly afterwards the town's name was changed to honor W. D. Stapleton, the man who was instrumental in getting a railroad depot for their town. The railroad was important to the local economy and early on the trains passed through Stapleton several times a day {{as they made their way}} to the southern end of the county and back. Highway traffic also picked up as of 1936 when the only paved road in Baldwin County, other than a small <b>strip</b> in <b>Bay</b> Minette going from the courthouse to the railroad, was the stretch of US 31 coming in from Atmore and ending at Stapleton. [...] By the 1970s the train traffic had slowed down to at most one train making the down and back trip each day. Now the train tracks are completely gone.|$|R
40|$|To characterise the {{relaxation}} {{induced by the}} soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) activator, BAY 60 - 2770 (4 -({(4 -carboxybutyl) [2 - (5 -fluoro- 2 -{[4 '-(trifluoromethyl) biphenyl- 4 -yl]methoxy}phenyl) ethyl] amino}methyl) benzoic acid) in rabbit corpus cavernosum (CC). The penis from male New Zealand rabbits was removed and fours strips of CC were obtained. Concentration-response curves to BAY 60 - 2770 were constructed in the absence and presence of inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, N (G) -nitro-L- arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 μm), sGC, 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ, 10 μm) and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE- 5), tadalafil (0. 1 μm). The potency (pEC 50) and maximal response (Emax) values were determined. Then, electrical-field stimulation (EFS) -induced contraction or relaxation was tested in the absence and presence of BAY 60 - 2770 (0. 1 or 1 μm) alone or combined with ODQ (10 μm). For EFS-induced relaxation two protocols were used: (i) ODQ (10 μm) was first incubated for 20 min and then BAY 60 - 2770 (1 μm) was added for another 20 min (ODQ + BAY 60 - 2770); (ii) in different CC <b>strips,</b> <b>BAY</b> 60 - 2770 was incubated for 20 min followed by another 20 min with ODQ (BAY 60 - 2770 + ODQ). The intracellular levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were also determined. BAY 60 - 2770 potently relaxed rabbit CC with mean (sem) pEC 50 and Emax values of 7. 58 (0. 19) and 81 (4) %, respectively. The inhibitors ODQ (n = 7) or tadalafil (n = 7) produced 4. 2 - and 6. 3 -leftward shifts, respectively in BAY 60 - 2770 -induced relaxation without interfering with the Emax values. The intracellular levels of cGMP were augmented after stimulation with BAY 60 - 2770 (1 μm) alone, whereas its co-incubation with ODQ produced even higher levels of cGMP. The EFS-induced contraction was reduced {{in the presence of}} BAY 60 - 2770 (1 μm) and this inhibition was even greater when BAY 60 - 2770 was co-incubated with ODQ. The nitrergic stimulation induced CC relaxation, which was abolished in the presence of ODQ. BAY 60 - 2770 alone increased the amplitude of relaxation. Co-incubation of ODQ and BAY 60 - 2770 did not alter {{the relaxation}} in comparison with ODQ alone. Interestingly, when BAY 60 - 2770 was incubated before ODQ, EFS-induced relaxation was partly restored in comparison with ODQ alone or ODQ + BAY 60 - 2770. The relaxation induced by the sGC activator, BAY 60 - 2770 was increased after sGC oxidation and unaltered in the absence of nitric oxide. Thus, this class of substances may have advantages over sGC stimulators or PDE- 5 inhibitors for treating patients with erectile dysfunction and extensive endothelial damage...|$|R

Flotilla commander Admiral Ivan Likhachev realized the dangers of basing the fleet in a foreign port, and settled on establishing a permanent base in Tsushima. He was aware that the British had attempted to set their flag there in 1859 and had conducted hydrographic surveys around the island in 1855. In 1860 he requested a go-ahead from the government in Saint Petersburg; the cautious foreign minister, Alexander Gorchakov, ruled out any incursions against British interests, while General Admiral Konstantin Nikolayevich suggested making a private deal {{with the head of}} Tsushima-Fuchū Domain, as long as it did not disturb [...] "the West".

5000|$|Nevertheless, the fix posting area {{method was}} the main {{technique}} used in U.S. en route system prior to the 1960s, for example, when en route radar became more widespread. This method evolved from similar techniques used in railroad dispatch. It simplifies conflict detection because aircraft on different routes can only possibly conflict at intersection points with other routes, or with aircraft on the same route. Each intersection point ("fix posting area") in the sector is made into a separate <b>bay</b> on the <b>strip</b> rack, and multiple strips are printed for each aircraft, one per bay. The controller then sorts <b>strips</b> within each <b>bay</b> by the estimated time the aircraft is expected over that point. Only aircraft estimated to cross within 10 minutes of each other are considered possible conflicts, at which point altitudes are then compared {{to determine if there}} actually is a conflict. Aircraft on the same route however (in either direction) must be checked for conflict regardless of time over the intersection.|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{determining}} phosphorus in sea water, using iron-impregnated strips of filter paper, was investigated and compared with standard colorimetric methods of phosphorus analysis. Laboratory experiments were undertaken {{to determine the}} number of iron strips required to extract phosphorus from sea water, the length of time a strip needed to adsorb all P from solution, the reproducibility of the method, and whether the strips could measure P adsorbed to different particles. Field studies were carried out with iron <b>strips</b> in Cleveland <b>Bay</b> and the Herbert estuary, and comparisons were made with concentrations of dissolved, particulate and organic phosphorus determined by standard techniques. The iron-strip method was shown to work well under laboratory conditions, but the field studies showed varying results for the different environments tested.
