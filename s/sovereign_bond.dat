When adjusting for inherent exchange rate risk, the pattern of systematic risk is similar, even though the level is generally lower. The findings have important implications for international portfolio managers that invest in emerging <b>sovereign</b> <b>bonds</b> and those who need benchmark instruments to analyze risk in assets such as corporate bonds in the emerging Asian financial markets.

40|$|While the {{literature}} on Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) is mainly focused on the stock market, {{little attention has been}} paid to SRI in <b>sovereign</b> <b>bonds.</b> This paper investigates the effect of taking into account socially responsible indicators for countries, the Vigeo Sustainability Ratings (VSR), on the efficient frontier formed with the <b>sovereign</b> <b>bonds</b> of twenty developed countries. It shows that it is possible to increase the portfolios’ VSR rating without significantly harming the risk/return relationship. The analysis then focuses on specific ratings relating to a) the environment, b) social concerns, and c) public governance. The results suggest that socially responsible portfolios of <b>sovereign</b> <b>bonds</b> can be built without a significant diversification cost. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} <b>sovereign</b> risk on <b>bond</b> duration. We compare the sovereign risk-adjusted duration for U.

We find that the sovereign risk-adjusted duration is significantly shorter than its Macaulay counterpart for all bonds, regardless of their bond rating and their maturity. Further, the "shortening" effect of sovereign risk on duration gets stronger as bond rating deteriorates and in recessionary conditions. Our findings provide {{strong support for the}} importance of adjusting for <b>sovereign</b> risk when <b>bond</b> portfolio managers apply the popular duration measure to hedge interest rate risk.

40|$|There was a rapid {{compression}} in the spreads of Romanian <b>sovereign</b> <b>bonds</b> in last years, to {{a record}} low level reached {{in the summer of}} 2007. We show that the developments in the domestic fundamentals and in the risk appetite of foreign investors on the international markets explain the developments in the spreads. Using data for EMBIG spreads for Romania and other ten Emerging Economies, we find a long-run relationship between the spreads {{on the one hand and}} a Credit Rating Outlook Index (CROI) and the volatility index VIX on the other hand. The CROI is a proxy for the developments in the domestic fundamentals, while the VIX is a proxy for the risk appetite of the international investors. To estimate the long-run relationship, we use both a pool equation with fixed effects and the pooled mean group (PMG) estimator of Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1997). There is a large similitude between the deviations of spreads from the level implied by the long-run relationship in the case of Bulgaria and Romania, which we explain by the EU accession process of these two countries. We find also a comovement in the volatility of daily returns of CEE <b>sovereign</b> <b>bonds,</b> with spillover effects especially between Bulgaria and Romania.
