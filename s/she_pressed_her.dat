500|$|O'Hara was so keen on Gaelic {{football}} that at {{one point}} <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> father to found a women's team, and professed that Glenmalure Park, the home ground of the Rovers, became [...] "like a second home". She enjoyed fighting, and trained in judo as a teenager. She later admitted that she displayed a jealousy towards boys in her youth and the freedom they had, and that they could steal apples from orchards and not get into trouble.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> lips {{together}} again, {{and took a}} long deep breath.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> lips {{together}} in that old familiar hunt for words and phrases.|$|E
60|$|LADY. Oh, horribly afraid, agonizingly afraid. (<b>She</b> <b>presses</b> <b>her</b> {{hands on}} her heart.) It hurts only to imagine it.|$|R

5000|$|Enric Folch (Xavier Boada) and Carme (Fanny Gautier): Amelia's parents. While {{he appears}} more {{tolerant}} about his daughter's concerns, <b>she</b> <b>presses</b> <b>her</b> {{to marry and}} settle down.|$|R
60|$|She ceased; she {{had heard}} him at last. <b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> hand to her forehead.|$|E

60|$|He {{looked at}} Norah. <b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> sister's hand encouragingly, and {{answered}} {{for both of}} them.|$|E
6000|$|MABEL too gets up. <b>She</b> <b>presses</b> <b>her</b> {{hands to}} her forehead, then [...] walks blindly round to behind the sofa and stands looking {{straight}} [...] in front of her.|$|R
5|$|While {{preparing}} to dig her nest, the female sometimes exhibits a mysterious preliminary behavior. <b>She</b> <b>presses</b> <b>her</b> throat {{against the ground}} of different potential sites, perhaps sensing moisture, warmth, texture, or smell, although her exact motivation is unknown. She may further temporize by excavating several false nests as the wood turtles also do.|$|R
60|$|When Anna Brangwen {{heard the}} news, <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> back <b>her</b> head and rolled her eyes, as if {{something}} were reaching forward to bite at <b>her</b> throat. <b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> back <b>her</b> head, her mind was driven back to sleep. Since she had married and become a mother, the girl she had been was forgotten. Now, the shock threatened to break in upon her and sweep away all her intervening life, make her as a girl of eighteen again, loving <b>her</b> father. So <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> back, away from the shock, she clung to her present life.|$|R

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> hand to {{her side}} and writhed. Telford turned desperately to the door. Min raised her arm.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What's the matter?' he said again, {{when she}} was quieter. But <b>she</b> only <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> face further into his shoulder, in pain, like a child that cannot tell.|$|R
60|$|With these words, in a mute {{passion of}} grief <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> to <b>her</b> breast {{and to her}} lips the chaplet of her {{deceased}} husband, and proceeded to thrust it into Dwining's hands.|$|R
2500|$|Though Martha is a sweet, kindly woman, her [...] "old maid" [...] mindset irks {{the rugged}} Cleaver males. During {{one of her}} visits, she makes milk toast for breakfast and {{eggplant}} for dinner. In one episode, she buys Beaver a short-pants suit and insists he wear it to school.

50|$|Lucy {{is locked}} in the bag, {{suspended}} upside down, and dropped into the water. She appears to be struggling to escape when several gun shots fire. It's Vivian, dressed in a red disguise but with the same black veil covering <b>her</b> face. <b>She</b> <b>presses</b> <b>her</b> 'self-defence bra' and the spikes once again stick out. She demands money and the audience {{give it to her}} whilst Monte stares in shock. Jeanette also gives her two bags of money from the register.|$|R

60|$|She felt nervously in {{her pocket}} for a handkerchief; <b>she</b> <b>pressed</b> it to <b>her</b> lips.|$|R
60|$|Petite maman {{felt her}} heart beating so vigorously that she could hardly breathe. <b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> {{wrinkled}} hands tightly against her bosom.|$|E

6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> {{daughter}} closer, {{and felt}} rather than heard a little sigh; {{but all that}} Mary said was, 'Then I had better not think about it.' ...|$|E

60|$|When at {{last they}} were in the hut and the door-board had been safely closed, Rachel took Noie in her arms and kissed her. But Noie did not kiss <b>her</b> back; <b>she</b> only <b>pressed</b> <b>her</b> hand against her forehead.|$|R
