40|$|Abstract This {{communication}} {{reports the}} second known case of oral phaeohyphomycosis {{in a patient}} with <b>squamocellular</b> carcinoma of the lip. The patient, an 82 -year-old black woman, a former smoker (for more than 30 years), suffering from an ulcerous vegetative lesion in the middle third of the lower lip for approximately 12 months. The result of the histopathological analysis indicated carcinoma, with well-differentiated keratinized squamous cells {{and the presence of}} septate mycelial filaments. In the direct mycological examination, thick and dematiaceous septate mycelial filaments were observed. After the resection surgery, the patient did not need to use an antifungal drug to treat the phaeohyphomycosis, and no follow-up radiotherapy was needed to treat the <b>squamocellular</b> carcinoma. We stress that the presence of the <b>squamocellular</b> lesion of the lip was a possible contributing factor to the infection...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. According to {{the data}} from immunological, {{biological}} and molecular researches, there is a close association between the undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (UCNT) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). To use IgA EA antibody as a serological marker in our patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma from a clinical viewpoint. Methods. 91 patients were followed in the period from 1989 − 1998. In 11 of the patients the antibody titre serum for the early antigen of EBV virus were determinated before the treatment, and in 24 of the patients 3 years after the treatment. There were three control groups of patients: 20 voluntary blood donors, 26 patients with <b>squamocellular</b> laryngeal carcinoma, and 10 patients with <b>squamocellular</b> nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Results. In the group of 11 patients with UCNT before the treatment, the value of anti-EA IgA titre was 31. 09, and in the patients after the treatment anti-EA IgA antiody titre was 14. 56. In the control groups of patients the results were: in the blood donors 5. 00; in the group with the diagnosis of <b>squamocellular</b> laryngeal carcinoma, the titre was 5. 00; in the patients with <b>squamocellular</b> nosopharyngeal carcinoma, the titre anti-EA IgA was 5. 36. Conclusion. These results were statistically highly significant (p < 0. 01). Our research clearly showed that anti-EA IgA EBV marker could be useful in diagnosing, differential diagnosing and prognosing as well...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Keratin 5 (K 5) {{is present}} in the basal layer of a {{stratified}} squamous keratinized and non‑keratinized epithe-lium. K 5 and K 14 have been demonstrated in the mucosa and tumors of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx, and in the mitotic active basal cells of a stratified squamous epithelium. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess K 5 expression in <b>squamocellular</b> carcinoma with various localizations in the head and neck. A total of 13 biopsy fragments were included from patients diagnosed with <b>squamocellular</b> carcinoma of the larynx area (n= 2), pharynx (n= 2), hard palate (n= 1), tongue (n= 2), submandibular (n= 1), lip (n= 1), gingival sulcus (n= 1), nasal pyramid (n= 1), maxilla (n= 1) and zygomatic (n= 1). The immunohistochemical staining for K 5 was evaluated according to the following score criteria: 0 (0 % positive cells); 1 ( 30 % positive cells). K 5 expression was observed in all <b>squamocellular</b> carcinomas included in the present study with scores between 1 and 3. For well ‑ and moderately‑differentiated histopathological types, a maximum score of 3 was recorded for all of the cases, not including the laryngeal area, which presented a score of 2. The following scores were identified in the regions of the poorly differentiated carcinomas: Jaw, 3; gingival sulcus, 2; and tongue and submandibular area, 1. These observations may aid with an improved stratification of head and neck <b>squamocellular</b> carcinoma, thus improving the diagnosis and treatment strategies for this type of cancer...|$|E

40|$|Pim- 1 is an oncogenic serine/threonine kinase with poorly defined {{function}} in epithelial cancers. In this study, we determined 1) associations of Pim- 1 expression with clinicopathological parameters including responsiveness to irradiation in <b>squamocellular</b> cancers of {{head and neck}} and 2) how Pim- 1 expression is controlled subsequent to irradiation. Moderate to high expression of Pim- 1 correlated to poor response to radiation therapy (P =. 003). It is also associated to the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, P <. 0001), which {{has been shown to}} be activated by irradiation. In radioresistant tumors, irradiation promoted nuclear translocation of Pim- 1 (P <. 005). When directly testing EGFR dependence of Pim- 1 expression, up-regulation and nuclear translocation of Pim- 1 could be induced through stimulation of EGFR with its ligands EGF or transforming growth factor α. Both ligand- and irradiation-induced changes in Pim- 1 expression and localization could be inhibited by the monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab and by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib also targeting EGFR. These results suggest that irradiation-induced activation of EGFR upregulates Pim- 1, and Pim- 1 may be used as a novel predictive marker of radiation response in patients with <b>squamocellular</b> cancers of head and neck...|$|E
30|$|An {{uncommon}} malignancy in {{the general}} population, <b>squamocellular</b> anal carcinoma (SCAC) accounts for approximately 1 % of all gastrointestinal neoplasms and less than 5 % of anorectal tumours.

40|$|Leiomyomata are {{the most}} common benign uterine tumors and are a major cause of {{gynecological}} morbidity and infertility. <b>Squamocellular</b> cervical carcinoma, in turn, is a common gynecologic malignancy. However, their etiopathogenesis remains poorly understood. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize from an ultrastructural point of view the changes occurring in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of human uterine cervices with leiomyoma or <b>squamocellular</b> carcinoma. Eight women, aged 45 - 58, underwent laparoscopic myomectomy (n= 5) or vaginal hysterectomy (endometrial carcinoma, n= 3). Samples were processed for transmission electron microscopy, and digital images were obtained from either semithin and thin resin-embedded sections. The lamina propria of the uterine cervix with leiomyoma was generally filled by a dense and disarranged ECM, wherein twisted collagen fibers with a regular banding and diameter, predominated. Collagen tended to be closely-packed and compartmentalized into large lacunar-like spaces by very thin (ca. 0, 25 μm) and long (> 10 μm) cytoplasmic processes originating from myofibroblastic, smooth muscle or interstitial Cajal-like cells. Fibril-forming channels or fibripositors (Birk et al., 1989; Starborg et al., 2008), were sometimes identified and consisted of isolated collagen fibrils surrounded by plasma membrane. Very electron dense core-like aggregates (1 - 2 μm length x 1 - 1, 5 μm width) scattered within the lacunar-like spaces. Cores consisted of structures whose diameter was similar to that of collagen (ca. 71 nm) but showing a gradient of decreasing electron density from the core itself towards peripheral mature collagen fibers; in between these fibers, intermediate electron dense ones laid (fibrillin microfibrils?). Leiomyoma showed more and denser ECM with respect to carcinoma, the latter evidencing numerous and heterogeneous, actively proliferating cancer cells, leaving few and small intercellular spaces wherein macrophages, mast cells and plasma cells, were sometimes observed. The abnormal orientation of collagen fibers in leiomyoma contributes to the fibrotic and stable ECM and may also facilitate local tumor invasion. Therapy in these cases should target ECM dissolution, rather than solely inhibiting cell proliferation...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at: (i) {{investigating}} the expression profiles of some antioxidant and {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor genes in cancerous and unaffected tissues of patients undergoing lung resection for {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) (cross-sectional phase), (ii) evaluating if gene expression levels at the time of surgery may be associated to patients' survival (prospective phase). Antioxidant genes included heme oxygenase 1 (HO- 1), superoxide dismutase- 1 (SOD- 1), and - 2 (SOD- 2), whereas epidermal growth factor receptor genes consisted of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and v-erb-b 2 erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (HER- 2). Twenty-eight couples of lung biopsies were obtained and gene transcripts were quantified by Real Time RT-PCR. The average follow-up of patients lasted about 60 months. In the cancerous tissues, antioxidant genes were significantly hypo-expressed than in unaffected tissues. The HER- 2 transcript levels prevailed in adenocarcinomas, whereas EGFR in <b>squamocellular</b> carcinomas.

40|$|Background. Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica Bazex (APB) is a {{very rare}} disease {{in the group of}} obligate paraneoplastic dermatoses, {{associated}} mostly with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract and metastatic cervical lymphadenopathy. The disease is characterized by violaceous erythemosquamous changes on the acral regions. This entity was first reported by Bazex in 1965. About 160 cases have been presented so far. Case report. We presented a patient with a three-month history of violaceous erythema, edema, erosions and scaling on the acral regions, elbows and knees and severe nail dystrophy. When the diagnosis was established, he did not have any symptom of internal malignancy. Esophagogastroscopy revealed ulcerovegetant lesion of the esophagus, while histology showed <b>squamocellular</b> invasive carcinoma. Surgical tumor removal resulted in significant improvement of skin changes in 15 days. Unfortunately, four months later, extensive skin lesions pointed to metastasis of squamous cell carcinoma. Conclusion. Skin changes can precede a few years the first manifestations of neoplasia. The course of the disease in our patient proved that APB is a specific marker of underlying malignancy...|$|E
40|$|Loss of {{autofluorescence}} as {{an early}} phenomenon associated with tissue degeneration seems to be promising for the diagnosis of oral cancer. The method seems to make visible early structural and biochemical alterations of the oral mucosa not always evident under direct inspection of the oral cavity. For this reason, {{the margins of the}} mucosal lesions usually appear wider compared with direct visualization. Actual extension of the potentially malignant lesions must be precisely perceived to avoid any underestimation of the tumor. In this study, 32 patients at risk for oral cancer underwent autofluorescence test. Of these patients, 12 (group A) experienced potentially malignant diseases. The other 20 patients (group B) were previously operated on for oral cancer. In addition, 13 patients showed loss of autofluorescence (8 patients from group A and 5 patients from group B). Among these 13 patients, 12 were affected with lesions of relevance (in group A, 6 had <b>squamocellular</b> carcinoma and 2 had low-grade dysplasia; in group B, 2 patients had high-grade dysplasia, 2 had low-grade dysplasia, and 1 had an epithelial hypertrophy with inflammatory cells).

40|$|Head {{and neck}} <b>squamocellular</b> {{carcinoma}} (HNSCC) {{has now become}} the 6 th most common cancer among men {{in the developed world}} and affects the oral cavity, salivary glands, larynx and pharynx. Tobacco chewing, alcohol consumption and last but not least, smoking seem {{to be the most important}} risk factors. In particular in non-drinkers, smoke increases the relative risk (RR) of developing HNSCC of the oral cavity and pharynx from 2 to 20 fold; especially in the oral cavity, the association between alcohol and smoke could have a multiplier effect. Cancer arises from damage to DNA of genes located at various points of the short (p) and long (q) arms of a number of chromosomes, caused by exposure to various carcinogens. Thus, the carcinogenic process requires continuous exposure to environmental carcinogens (i. e., longstanding history of smoking and drinking), an increased susceptibility to carcinogens (induced by xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme polymorphism) and an impaired DNA repair capacity (both inherited and acquired). Our purpose in this paper is to review advances in the understanding of the role of the European or Caucasian genetic aberrations that affect carcinogen metabolism and DNA repair genes in oral HNSCC development: we consider that those abnormalities will be useful in assessing individuals at risk...|$|E
40|$|Esophageal cancer {{represents}} the 6 th cause of cancer mortality in the World. New treatments led to outcome improvements, but patient selection and prognostic stratification {{is a critical}} aspect to gain maximum benefit from therapies. Today, patients are stratified into 9 prognostic groups, according to a staging system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Recently, trying to better select patients with curing possibilities several authors are reconsidering tumor length as a valuable prognostic parameter. Specifically, endoscopic tumor length can be easily measured with an esophageal endoscopy and, if its utility in esophageal cancer staging is demonstrated, it may represent a simple method to identify high risk patients and an easy-to-obtain variable in prognostic stratification. In this study we retrospectively analyzed 662 patients treated for esophageal cancer, stratified according to cancer histology and current staging system, to assess the possible role of endoscopic tumor length. We found a significant correlation between endoscopic tumor length, current staging parameters and 5 -year survival, proving that endoscopic tumor length {{may be used as}} a simple risk stratification tool.

The aim: the authors presented therapeutical results of three-year survived patients with <b>squamocellular</b> cancers of the hypopharynx (SCC Hy), grades III and IV, in relation to specific modalities of therapeutical approach. Methods: a series of 207 patients with grades III and IV of SCC Hy, treated in the period 1982 to 2002, was analyzed. Group I consisted of 131 patients who had surgery and postoperative radiotherapy (SUR-RT). Group II included 16 patients who underwent induction chemotherapy, surgery and postoperative radiotherapy (IC-SURRT). Group III consisted of 60 patients, who had primary radiotherapy (RT). Group IV involved 29 patients who were treated, in the period 2003 - 2006, by neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with potentiation (CHT-RT).

40|$|Abstract Background Pim family kinases {{are small}} constitutively active serine/threonine-specific kinases, {{elevated}} levels {{of which have been}} detected in human hematopoietic malignancies as well as in solid tumours. While we and others have previously shown that the oncogenic Pim kinases stimulate survival of hematopoietic cells, we now examined their putative role in regulating motility of adherent cancer cells. For this purpose, we inhibited Pim kinase activity using a small molecule compound, 1, 10 -dihydropyrrolo[2, 3 - a]carbazole- 3 -carbaldehyde (DHPCC- 9), which we had recently identified as a potent and selective inhibitor for all Pim family members. Results We now demonstrate that the Pim kinase inhibitor DHPCC- 9 is very effective also in cell-based assays. DHPCC- 9 impairs the anti-apoptotic effects of Pim- 1 in cytokine-deprived myeloid cells and inhibits intracellular phosphorylation of Pim substrates such as Bad. Moreover, DHPCC- 9 slows down migration and invasion of cancer cells derived from either prostate cancer or <b>squamocellular</b> carcinoma patients. Silencing of Pim expression reduces cell motility, while Pim overexpression enhances it, strongly suggesting that the observed effects of DHPCC- 9 are dependent on Pim kinase activity. Interestingly, DHPCC- 9 also abrogates NFATc-dependent migration of cancer cells, implying that NFATc factors mediate {{at least part of the}} pro-migratory effects of Pim kinases. Conclusions Altogether, our data indicate that DHPCC- 9 is not only a powerful tool to investigate physiological effects of the oncogenic Pim family kinases, but also an attractive molecule for drug development to inhibit invasiveness of Pim-overexpressing cancer cells. </p...|$|E

MethodsWe enrolled nine patients with histological diagnosis of recurrence of V-SCC. Intravenous bleomycin was injected under general sedation after an accurate mapping of all lesions and ECT was performed. Patients were reviewed after one, three and six months. Response to therapy was evaluated using RECIST criteria {{and quality of life}} (QoL) was evaluated via questionnaires. ResultsThe median age was 84 years (range 80 – 90 years). The main location of recurrences was the vulva (87. 5 %). Multiple lesions were present in 25 % of cases. No peri-operative complications were observed. Response to therapy was complete in 62. 5 % of patients, partial in 12. 5 %, no change was observed in 12. 5 % and progression of disease in 12. 5 % of patients respectively.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} and confirm the efficacy {{and safety of}} electrochemotherapy (ECT) using bleomicyn in a large series of non-melanoma head and neck cancers. Background: ECT combines chemotherapy and electroporation to increase drug uptake into cancer cells. ECT {{has proven to be}} effective in the treatment of tumor nodules of cutaneous and subcutaneous localization. Up to now, this therapy has been mainly used as a local control of melanoma skin metastasis. Few studies have focused on its role in the treatment of head and neck cutaneous and subcutaneous cancers. Methods: Twenty-five patients underwent ECT for the treatment of non-melanoma head and neck cancers. All tumors were classified by histological type (confirmed by biopsy), size, and TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors (TNM). Treatments were performed using a bolus of bleomicyn and a pulse generator under local or general anesthesia after the ESOPE (European Standard Operating Procedures of Electrochemotherapy) standard operating procedures. Results: An objective response was achieved in 100 % of treated patients (n = 25) at 6 weeks after the initial treatment. The complete response rate according to the WHO criteria was 72 % (n = 18); the partial response rate was 28 % (n = 7). None of the lesions that achieved a complete response relapsed after a median follow-up period of 18 months. Partial responders showed stable disease {{for the duration of the}} follow-up.

40|$|Aim: Malignant tumors of {{the larynx}} account for 2. 3 % of all malignancies, while their {{frequency}} among {{tumors of the}} head and neck ranges between 12 % and 20 %. Research on the general immune competence in patients with malignant diseases has provided useful insight in the relationship between immune disorders on one side and the clinical course on the other. Unfortunately, only few complete studies have been published so far with this regard in patients with malignant tumors of the larynx, and therefore our study was essentially aimed at establishing of general immunocompetence, presence and levels of the possible immune disorders and their association with the malignant tumors. Material and method: The study included forty two patients with primary <b>squamocellular</b> laryngeal cancer. All the patients underwent surgery, out of whom fifteen were treated postoperatively with radiotherapy. We tested the immune competence prior to the operation and in the postoperative period nine months later. In the venous blood we examined T lymphocyte function, monocyte levels and mononuclear phagocyte function. Results: Preoperative evaluation of the presence and levels of general immune competence in patients with laryngeal cancer, showed a distinct decrease in the proliferative response to the PHA mitogen in vitro, with a tendency to normalize in patients who do not develop a relapse of the disease or distant metastasis during the follow- up period. During the whole study period, the number of monocytes and mononuclear phagocyte activity was above the normal level.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Nowadays, esophagectomy and neoadjuvant-therapy is the {{standard}} care for esopahageal cancer but distant metastasis or invasion of others organs are controindications for surgery. Moreover, severe co-morbidities may make difficult or even impossible such an extensive surgical procedure. Currently, endoscopic palliation may be performed with laser therapy or prosthesis positioning {{or a combination of}} both. AIMS & METHODS: The aims of our study were to compare functional outcome and survival in patients underwent to laser-therapy, prosthesis positioning and combinated approach. Two-hundred fifty-three consecutive patients who had endoscopic palliation for esophageal cancer from 1994 to 2012 in our Surgical Endoscopy Unit were enrolled in this retrospective study. Histotype was <b>squamocellular</b> carcinoma in 96 patients, while in the remaning cases it was adenocarcinoma. One-hundred sixty-three patients underwent laser therapy alone, 26 patients underwent prosthesis positioning alone and 63 underwent to both procedures in combination. Eighteen patients also had chemotherapy alone, 48 patients also had radiotherapy and 22 had also a combination of radiochemotherapy. A dysphagia score was created (0 : absolute dysphagia; 1 : liquid diet; 2 : semisolid diet; 3 : free diet). Survival analysis and non parametric statistics were performed. RESULTS: The primary endpoint was a dysphagia score and patients who had a prosthesis positioned reported a significantly lower score (p< 0. 01) than patients who did not have any prosthesis. Moreover, patients who had laser therapy alone had a better dysphagia than patients who had laser therapy and prosthesis positioning (p< 0. 01). Survival analysis did not show any difference between laser therapy, prosthesis positioning or the combination of both in term of overall survival. Only radiotherapy, revealed to be a significant predictor of better survival in these patients. (p = 0. 03). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that in spite of a similar survival prosthesis positioning is associated to a worse fuctional palliation than laser therapy. Radiotherapy alone was associated to a benefit in survival in patients with not resectable esophageal cancer. Therefore, these data seemed to suggest that a combination of endoscopic laser therapy and external radiotherapy may yield the best results in palliative care of advanced esophageal cancer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Incidence {{trends of}} {{laryngeal}} cancer in Finland were analyzed, especially {{in relation to}} survival, in a patient series of 5766 patients diagnosed in 1956 – 1995 and identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry. The age-adjusted incidence rate decreased from 6. 5 to 3. 5 per 100   000 person-years in males and remained unchanged among females. Only minor improvement occurred in survival. In a hospital-based material from Northern Finland (353 patients with laryngeal <b>squamocellular</b> carcinoma, LSCC, diagnosed in 1976 – 1995), the incidence among males decreased only for supraglottic cancer, diminishing the supraglottic to glottic incidence ratio from 1. 4 : 1 to 0. 5 : 1. Evaluation of diagnostic delays {{and their impact on}} survival and risk of recurrence was undertaken in a sample of 66 LSCC patients. In only 38 % of the patients was malignancy suspected at the initial visit to a physician; infection was the most common misdiagnosis (41 %). Half of the first consultations resulted in referral, whereas 17 % of the patients were neither referred nor controlled. The median patient delay was 2 months and median professional delay 3 months. The latter exceeded 12 months in 17 % of the patients. The delays were not significantly related to any other clinical parameter, nor were they interrelated. Professional delay of 12 months or more resulted in increased relative hazard of death (HR =  4. 74, p =  0. 05), equalling the effect of advanced stage (stage IV). One-third of the patients developed a recurrence. In univariate analysis, professional delay of 12 months or more increased the risk of local (p =  0. 019) and neck (p =  0. 019) recurrence. In a multivariate model, professional delay of 12 months or more indicated an adjusted relative hazard ratio (HR) of 4. 6 for local recurrence (p =  0. 02) and 9. 5 for neck recurrence (p =  0. 015). Immunohistochemical factors p 53, apoptosis, angiogenesis and proliferation were included in a multivariate model evaluating prognostic factors of LSCC in addition to clinical and sociodemographic factors. Advanced stage (stages III–IV) (relative hazard ratio of death (HR) 8. 9, p =  0. 01), supraglottic site (HR 5. 6, p =  0. 02) and high apoptotic index (≥  0. 3) (HR 11. 1, p =  0. 05) were the best indicators of impaired prognosis. Professional delay and enhanced apoptotic rate could be helpful in selecting LSCC patients for more aggressive primary treatment...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Elettrochemotherapy (ECT) {{is a new}} {{technique}} for treatment of superficial solid tumours of different histologies that don’t respond to conventional therapies. It combines chemotherapy and electric pulses by appropriate device (Clinoporetor, IGEA-Srl, Italy) that permeabilize, with appropriate parameters, the cell membrane in a transient and reversible manner, allowing low penetrating drugs to enter the cell, to get to high concentrations and thus magnifying their cytotoxicity. Moreover, the association of ECT with surgical debulking also permits the treatment of cancer lesions very deep and large. Methods: From March 2007 to March 2009 we treated fifteen patients with cancer metastases with different histology: melanoma, leiomiosarcoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer, <b>squamocellular</b> cancer of scalp. All patients previously undergone surgical debulking. Intravenous infusion of Bleomycin (15 mg/m 2) ECT was administered before ECT, than electric pulses were applied on the debalked areas using needle electrodes in a time window of 20 - 30 minutes. All procedures were performed in general anaesthesia. All patients were also treated with systemic therapies. Results: The treatment was safe and well tolerated. Starting from the second/third week from the treatment, all pts showed a slow progressive necrotic and fibro-sclerotic evolution of the areas treated (verified also with TAC or RMN radiograms and biopsies aimed). Twelve patients with local R 0 or R 1 disease never showed relaps in the treated area. Tree patients of this group died after 2 and 3 month because of a rapid spreading of the tumor in {{other regions of the}} body. In the second group of 3 patients with residual deseas after surgical debulking, two patient showed a slow relapse of tumor, and one patient a progressive regression with a “restitutio ad integrum” for second intention. Moreover 2 of these patients showed the appearance of new lesions on the areas located near the region treated with ECT and surgery debulking. The median overall survival of the entire group was 4 + month (1 + - 15 +), and {{the cause of death was}} been in all patients a sistemic evolution of the tumor. Conclusions: Our data confirm that ECT is a promising and safe treatment for superficial lesions from different malignancies. General anaesthesia and surgical debulking permit to treat very large and deeper lesion with a good local control. Surgical debulking, concomitant systemic treatment and no rapid disease spreading were related to a better local control and survival...|$|E
