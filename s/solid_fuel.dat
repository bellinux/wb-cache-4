5|$|Fire arrow: One of the {{earliest}} weaponized forms of gunpowder was the fire arrow which received {{its name from the}} translated Chinese term huǒjiàn (火箭), which literally means fire arrow. In China a 'fire arrow' referred to a gunpowder projectile consisting of a bag of incendiary gunpowder attached to the shaft of an arrow from the 9th century onward. Later on <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> rockets utilizing gunpowder were used to provide arrows with propulsive force and the term fire arrow became synonymous with rockets in the Chinese language. In other languages such as Sanskrit 'fire arrow' (agni astra) underwent a different semantic shift and became synonymous with 'cannon.'

5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's <b>Solid</b> <b>Fuel</b> Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.|$|E
40|$|Background: India {{contributes}} 24 % of {{the global}} annual child deaths due to acute respiratory infections (ARIs). According to WHO, nearly 50 % of the deaths among children due to ARIs is because of indoor air pollution (IAP). There is insufficient evidence {{on the relationship between}} IAP from the use of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> and incidence of life threatening respiratory illnesses (LTRI) in children in India. Methods: Panel data of children born during 2001 - 02, from the Young Lives Study (YLS) conducted in India during 2002 and 2006 - 07 was used to estimate the impact of household use of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> for cooking on LTRI in children. Multivariable two-stage random effects logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds of suffering from LTRI among children from households using <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> relative to children from households using other fuels (Gas/Electricity/Kerosene). Results: Bivariate results indicate that the probability of an episode of LTRI was considerably higher among children from households using <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> for cooking (18 %) than among children from households using other fuels (10 %). Moreover, children from households using <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> in both the rounds of YLS were more likely to suffer from one or more than one episode of LTRI compared to children from households using <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> in only one round. Two-stage random effects logistic regression result shows that children from households using <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> were 1. 78 (95 % CI: 1. 05 - 2. 99) times as likely to suffer from LTRI as those from households using other fuels. Conclusion: The findings of this paper provide conclusive evidence on the harmful effects of the use of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> for cooking on LTRI in India. The Government of India must make people aware about the health risks {{associated with the use of}} <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> for cooking and strive to promote the use of cleaner fuels...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Evidence {{supporting}} {{the association of}} COPD or airflow obstruction with use of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> is conflicting and inconsistent. Objective: To assess the association of airflow obstruction with self-reported use of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> for cooking or heating. Methods: We analysed 18, 554 adults from the BOLD study, who had provided acceptable post-bronchodilator spirometry measurements and information on use of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels.</b> The association of airflow obstruction with use of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> for cooking or heating was assessed by sex, within each site, using regression analysis. Estimates were stratified by national income and meta-analysed. We carried out similar analyses for spirometric restriction, chronic cough and chronic phlegm. Measurements and main results: We found no association between airflow obstruction and use of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> for cooking or heating (ORmen= 1. 20, 95 %CI 0. 94 - 1. 53; ORwomen= 0. 88, 95 %CI 0. 67 - 1. 15). This was true for low/middle and high income sites. Among never smokers there was also no evidence of an association of airflow obstruction with use of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> (ORmen= 1. 00, 95 %CI 0. 57 - 1. 76; ORwomen= 1. 00, 95 %CI 0. 76 - 1. 32). Overall, we found no association of spirometric restriction, chronic cough or chronic phlegm {{with the use of}} <b>solid</b> <b>fuels.</b> However, we found that chronic phlegm was more likely to be reported among female never smokers and those who had been exposed for ≥ 20 years. Conclusion: Airflow obstruction assessed from post-bronchodilator spirometry was not associated with use of <b>solid</b> <b>fuels</b> for cooking or heating...|$|R

5|$|In June 1916, the Russian {{geologist}} Nikolay Pogrebov oversaw mining of {{the first}} tonnes of oil shale at Pavandu and delivered it to Saint Petersburg (then Petrograd) Polytechnic Institute for large-scale experiments. These events marking {{the beginning of the}} Estonian oil shale industry took place {{more than half a century}} after an oil shale industry had emerged in Scotland, the leading oil shale industry in 1916, and a decade before the industry emerged in China, which, besides Estonia, is today the other leading oil shale-exploiting country. In 1916 a total of 640–690tonnes of oil shale were sent to Saint Petersburg for testing. The tests proved that the oil shale was suitable for combustion as a <b>solid</b> <b>fuel</b> and for extraction of oil shale gas and shale oil. Based on these promising results, a plan for oil shale mining in Estonia was presented to the Emperor Nicholas II on 3 January 1917. On 13 February 1917, the Council of Ministers of Russia allocated 1.2million rubles to purchase land and start mining activities. After the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government appointed a special commissioner for oil shale purchasing and stockpiling who began preliminary work for the digging of an oil shale mine at Pavandu, with full-scale construction carried out by about 500workers, including war prisoners, in the summer of 1917. After the October Revolution, financing ceased and construction stopped. Two private Saint Petersburg firms, established specially for oil shale mining, Böckel& Co. and Mutschnik& Co., which in the fall of 1916 had begun surface mining at Kukruse and Järve, respectively, also terminated their mining activities in 1917.|$|E
