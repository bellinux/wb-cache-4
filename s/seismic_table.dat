Dynamic fluid pressure data was got by the tests, and a new method that rain flow counting method was used in this study, in order to consider mean pressure throughout the vibration process, the pressure amplitude and the effective amplitude of the cumulative number of cycles factors together. Through this method, the strength of the dynamic fluid pressure could be described more reasonably.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} novel formulation for the rocking motion (RM) of rigid-blocks when no sliding mechanisms are present. Both theoretical and numerical analyses are included. The results {{obtained from a}} new formulation for single block dynamics, which have shown to be extremely powerful, led to the generalization for many degrees of freedom systems presented herein. That generalization was possible through a transformation of the Euclidean configuration space to a complex Riemannian manifold endowed with an Hermitian metric tensor. The present contribution applies also techniques derived from chaos theory to the RM problem for the understanding and quantification of the dynamic stability. The probability of overturn of rocking blocks under random loading is both experimentally and numerically investigated. Through an intensive use of the Poincaré surface of section technique and bifurcation analysis, the underlying structure of the phase space is highlighted. Delay coordinated, recurrence plots and recurrence quantification analysis are used to find the recurrences and patterns present in the dynamics at different time scales. An estimator for the quantification of chaos in the problem of rocking blocks under earthquake loading is proposed. Stochastic analysis is performed through an ensemble of input earthquake samples. The ensemble limits and other stochastic properties of the relevant physical magnitudes are analyzed. A set of experiments at a <b>seismic</b> <b>table</b> on four blue granite stones were conducted to validate the theoretical analyses. The response is investigated under different input actions and block geometries. Several applications to Earthquake Engineering and structural safety assessment are therefore derived. In particular, numerical thresholds for the probability of collapse of slender structures are found by means of different criteria. A model for the probability of collapse based on the stationary solution of the associated Fokker-Planck equation is proposed.

40|$|The Architectural Engineering major {{places a}} heavy {{emphasis}} on structural dynamics {{and the role of}} wind and seismic loading in building analysis and design. Buildings of high importance that are critical to community function, such as hospitals, often utilize supplemental damping devices like supplemental viscous fluid dampers or base isolators to reduce the overall demands on the structural system. The design and analysis of these dampers are typically not taught at the undergraduate level, and is frequently performed by mechanical engineers, in lieu of structural engineers. To better understand and research building behavior with supplemental damping devices, our multi-disciplinary team designed and fabricated an interactive, reconfigurable, multi-story model of a building.

Such data are particularly useful for rapid assessment of structural damage in a large urban setting after a major event such as an earthquake. This study explores the utilization of smartphone accelerometers for measuring structural vibration, from which structural health and post-event damage can be diagnosed. Widely available smartphones are tested under sinusoidal wave excitations with frequencies in the range relevant to civil engineering structures. Large-scale <b>seismic</b> shaking <b>table</b> tests, observing input ground motion and response of a structural model, are carried out to evaluate the accuracy of smartphone accelerometers under operational, white-noise and earthquake excitations of different intensity. Finally, the smartphone accelerometers are tested on a dynamically loaded bridge. The extensive experiments show satisfactory agreements between the reference and smartphone sensor measurements in both time and frequency domains, demonstrating the capability of the smartphone sensors to measure structural responses ranging from low-amplitude ambient vibration to high-amplitude seismic response.

40|$|In this study, damage {{localization}} {{of frame}} structures from seismic acceleration responses is explored using the DLV technique and ARX model for system identification. The {{concept of the}} DLV method is to identify the members with zero stress under some specific loading patterns derived by interrogating the changes in flexibility matrix of the structure {{before and after the}} damage state. Success of the DLV method for damage localization lies on the ability to identify the flexibility matrix. The ARX model, a discrete-time non-parametric auto-regressive system identification technique is adopted to identify the modal parameters (natural frequencies, transfer functions and mode shapes) from which the flexibility matrices of the intact and damaged structures are constructed. To explore the effectiveness of the DLV method, a five-storey steel model frame with diagonal bracings was considered for <b>seismic</b> shaking <b>table</b> tests. The damage conditions of the structure were simulated by partially removing some of the diagonals. With the flexibility matrices of both the intact and damaged structures synthesized on a truncated modal basis, the damage locations have been successfully identified by the DLV method for either single or multiple damage conditions, regardless of the damage locations.

The study results show that the characteristics of vertical seismic ground response are much different from those of horizontal seismic ground response; the amplification effect is greatly increased under multidirectional base excitations compared with that under unidirectional base excitations; greatly difference is induced by the rise of groundwater table between vertical and horizontal seismic response, as result of the rise of groundwater <b>table,</b> <b>seismic</b> amplification effect at ground surface increases in horizontal direction, but decreases in vertical direction，which are important for geotechnical engineering aseismic design in Shanghai region...|$|R
40|$|This {{demonstration}} Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment (PTHA) {{study of}} Crescent City, California {{was funded by}} BakerAECOM and motivated by FEMA's desire to explore methods to improve products of the FEMA Risk Mapping, Assessment, and Planning (Risk MAP) Program. The primary results, that is, the 100 - and 500 -year tsunami maps, are presented and discussed in Section 3 and Appendix C. These maps were generated by a signi cantly improved methodology {{than that of the}} Seaside study; the improvements include a more complete set of <b>seismic</b> sources (<b>Table</b> 1), and a more accurate method for estimating tidal uncertainty (Section 8). As expected, the inland extent and magnitude of the ooding for the 500 -year tsunami far exceed that of the 100 -year event; these products can now be compared with standard FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) to determine whether these ooding levels exceed estimates of other coastal ooding hazards, such as storm surge. A nal deliverable, digital data les of the map data, have been provided to BakerAECOM, and a description of these les is given in Appendix D. The primary conclusion we have reached {{in the course of this}} study is that the maps must be used with caution because (a) there are signi cant uncertainties in the speci ation of CSZ seismic sources (Section 4 and Section 7. 6) and (b) the standard 100 - and 500 -year maps are highly sensitive to these geophysical uncertainties and, in certain circumstances could even be misleading. Section 9. 2 discusses this sensitivity in the context of a non-regulatory product that provides valuable additional insight by presenting the same probabilistic information in a di erent format that we call a p-contour map. Finally, we recommend (a) that FEMA give serious consideration to the adoption of the p-contour map as a product that supplements and aids in the practical interpretation of the same probabilistic information displayed in the standard 100 - and 500 -year tsunami maps, and that (b) future PTHA studies should include close collaboration with a geoscientist expert in earthquake parameterization.

In order to avoid the disadvantages of the existing BRB, a new type of BRB with gap and protuberance was developed. Six new type BRBs were tested with low-reversed cyclic loading history including standard loading and low-cycle fatigue loading. The fatigue modes of BRB during the test were studied. Some mechanics properties indexes including elastic stiffness, secondary stiffness were identified based on the hysteresis curves of the BRB. And energy dissipation indexes from low-cycle fatigue loading test were calculated according to Chinese code and FEMA 356. In order to study seismic behavior of frames with BRB, two more buckling-restrained braced frames (BRBF) were tested including a plane BRBF with cyclic loading test and a BRBF with shaking table test. The test results of BRB indicate that the measured mechanical characteristics of BRB agree well with theoretical results and the energy dissipation behavior of BRB is stable.

The un-reinforced and the retrofitted with glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) strips masonry buildings were subjected to a series of earthquake excitations of increasing magnitude in or-der to progressively induce various small, moderate and severe levels of damage to the ma-sonry walls. The performance of the original and retrofitted building states is evaluated. Changes in the dynamic characteristics (lowest four modal frequencies and damping ratios) of the building are used to assess and quantify the damage states of the masonry walls. For this, the dynamic modal characteristics of the structure states after each earthquake event were estimated by performing low-amplitude impulse hammer and sine-sweep forced vibration tests. The retrofitting actions restored the stiffness characteristics of the reinforced masonry structure to the levels of the original undamaged un-reinforced structure. The results show that the despite a similar dynamic behavior identified, corresponding to reduction of the modal frequencies, the un-reinforced masonry building was severely damaged, while the rein-forced masonry building was able to withstand, without visual damage, the induced strong seismic excitations.

In Nagoya city, western part of Tokai district, damage of wooden houses due to liquefaction is brought in case {{of the past three}} destructive earthquakes which are the 1891 Nobi, the 1944 Tonankai and the 1945 Mikawa Earthquake during preiod from 1800 to 1950. The empirical equation of damage estimation is formulated from several factors, such as activity of ground liquefaction, irregularity of ground structure, duration time of seismic waves and strength of houses, which are applied to the sites of ground liquefaction based on literature review. The results are summarized as follows : (1) The severe damage to houses due to earthquake is explained by taking account of the effect of ground liquefaction occurred during earthquakes. Damage due to liquefaction is more than 20 to 40 per cent larger than that caused by the strong ground motion without liquefaction. (2) The correlation coefficient of the damage ratio of past earthquakes in relation to that of calculated value by the empirical equation is 0. 929.
