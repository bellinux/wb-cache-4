A literature review discusses the benefits and limitations of using radio as a medium to communicate information to <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers,</b> and how community radio has been used to meet the agricultural information needs of <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> in developing countries. An appropriate methodology extracted primary data on the special agricultural information needs and the special features of the information-seeking behaviour of the <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> in the Mchinji District. Twenty-five <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> from Gomani 2 Village in Mchinji district were interviewed, and open-ended interviews were conducted with four key staff members of the Mchinji Community Radio. Personal observation provided another source of data, and was used for triangulation purposes. The key findings are {{that the majority of the}} <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> make little use of the latest ICTs, such as mobile phones, television, and the Internet. The most popular sources of agricultural information are the extension officers and the radio. Most of the farmers prefer agricultural information in the local Chichewa language, and only a few contribute their views, skills, and expertise to the radio station. They specifically need information on training, maize production, weather reports, current global agricultural affairs, and cultural programmes that involve agriculture. The study proposes a strategy for the Mchinji Community Radio that combines programming and communication planning, partnerships, sustainability planning, and quality checks. The implementation of this strategy will ensure that Mchinji Community Radio meets the agricultural information needs of the <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> of Malawi’s Mchinji district.

40|$|The {{shift towards}} {{the use of}} private quality {{standards}} in global agrifood chains has raised concerns worldwide that <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> become excluded from lucrative export markets. In South Africa, given the historical exclusion of <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> from export-oriented agriculture, the government has therefore introduced different new institutional arrangements (IAs) between <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> and established agribusinesses to promote access to such markets. This chapter aims to analyse these IAs to understand whether and how these IAs contribute to enhanced market access for <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers.</b> Based on a conceptual framework on quality specifications and upgrading grounded in Global Value Chain analysis, the chapter first discusses the quality demands and standards in the South African citrus sector which manifest in a ‘Ladder of Market Access’. The following analysis reveals that IAs are able to promote the required product and process upgrading to include <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> into global export markets. Further upgrading opportunities, however, remain elusive as agribusinesses manage to position themselves as ‘gatekeepers’ which places barriers to farmers’ involvement beyond the farm gate.

After escaping to the border, Mam Nai joined one of the Khmer Rouge groups that had found sanctuary in Thailand. In the 1990s he was still working as an interrogator for the Khmer Rouge after joining Front 250, commanded by Ny Korn. Mam Nai left the Khmer Rouge shortly before Pol Pot ordered Son Sen's assassination in 1997, living as a private <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmer</b> in the West of the country.

5000|$|The {{utilization}} of right to farm policies for corporate agriculture {{can be considered}} a 'wicked problem'. These problems are shaped by [...] "dynamic social and political factors as well as biophysical complexities", and an array of local, state, and government stakeholders. These diverse actors result in a high degree of variability in terms of defining what is protected under respective right to farm laws. Thus, although the initial intention of such policies was to preserve the nation's agrarian roots and support the <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmer,</b> potential for misappropriation exists. Public sentiment expresses concern that the literature in these policies may prevent localities and states from regulating any number of agriculture based issues, essentially grant corporations immunity from environmental and ecological consequences resulting from their practices. In 2014, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)—a Koch-brothers organization which writes legislation on behalf of major multi-billion dollar corporations such as ExxonMobil, Pfizer, AT&T, SAP SE, and State Farm Insurance, among others—financially backed Missouri's Right-to-Farm amendment (Amendment 1), fueling further controversy that Right-to-Farm laws are being enacted to assist corporate agriculture, not small family-owned farms and the traditional farming practices used by small farm owners. In November 2016, Oklahoma voters defeated a Right-to-Farm bill (State Question 777) which garnered just 39.7 percent of the vote. State Question 777 was heavily backed by the Oklahoma Farm Bureau and by voters in the Oklahoma panhandle where the giant multinational agribusiness Seaboard Corporation has a pork production plant.|$|E

The Labor Party had been created in order to offer political support for former President/dictator Getúlio Vargas among the working classes, and Brizola, who was busy with creating party organizations across Rio Grande, at the time developed ties to the Vargas family through his personal friendship with Vargas's son Maneco as well as with Vargas's brother Espartaco., such friendships opening his way to make friends with Vargas himself, who was in internal exile after having been toppled from power in late 1945.

40|$|No {{escape from}} {{subsistence}} farming Cue: The subject of market liberalisation, {{and the impact}} it is having on our domestic producers, {{is one that is}} often addressed by politicians and economists. It?s probably less common for us to hear from the farmers themselves. Our next report offers a quick snapshot of one farmer?s view on liberalisation, and the effect it is having on his farming and on his livelihood. It?s a view that will certainly be shared by many farmers right across the continent. The report comes from South Africa; asking the questions is Lesibana Mantshiu. IN:		?Mr. Rudolph Letsoalo is a ? OUT:		?local markets nor internationally. ? DUR?N	 2 ? 15 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr. Rudolph Letsoalo expressing a view that may well be shared by millions of small-scale farmers across Africa. Transcript Mantshiu	Mr. Rudolph Letsoalo is a <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmer</b> in the Limpopo province in South Africa. Rudolph, what is the impact of liberalisation on you as a <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmer</b> and your family? Letsoalo	The impact of liberalisation, particularly to us, the small-scale farmers, and to our families, it is full of disadvantages. It disadvantages me as a <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmer</b> who has no subsidy; therefore my farm produce becomes really too expensive for the consumers. I cannot afford to export my farm produce to the global market, while the local market is also dominated by imports produced by farmers from rich countries like America, France and so on. This forces me also to remain a subsistence farmer {{for the rest of my}} farming career. Mantshiu	How have the farming practices changed as a result of this liberalisation? Letsoalo	We are really forced to buy more modern farming implements, in order to produce according to the required standard. The standards are very high nowadays, and we need to buy high quality seeds also, in order for us to produce high quality products. Otherwise, we may farm but our produce may not be bought by anybody, because the products may be of poor quality. We need to use more sophisticated farming methods to maximise also our produce, because without maximising produce, it is going to be difficult for one to sustain in this farming. To be able to sustain, we are forced to hire trained labour, which makes the whole process too costly for a <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmer</b> like myself. Mantshiu	How then do you see the future of small-scale farming? Letsoalo	This is a very important question. Unless our government intervenes to assist us as small-scale farmers, really it is going to be very difficult. We shall be forced to remain as subsistence farmers, who can neither compete at the local markets nor internationally. End of track. A <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmer</b> in South Africa describes the impact that economic liberalisation has had on his profitability, and calls on the government to assist farmers, otherwise they will never be able to move beyond subsistence farming...|$|E

The severe climatic conditions of southern Africa have an especially large {{impact on the}} agricultural practices of <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers.</b> These hazards should be mitigated to ensure more resilient communities and food security. This study mainly focuses on the timing of agricultural production in hazard-prone areas to prevent losses at peak-risk periods by adapting the agricultural cycle. This study focuses on the agricultural activities of <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> in Malawi, Madagascar and Mozambique. A literature review is presented, and a mixed-method research design were followed to determine the timing of production followed by these <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> {{and its impact on}} production and food security. Although this study found that the <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> generally plant with the first rains, it is recommended by literature that early planting should be practised to ensure optimal production. It is also recommended that <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> should implement watermanagement techniques for dry periods, and when farmers practice late planting, the use of residual-moisture retention should be utilised as a mitigation measure. This will in effect ensure that the communities are less vulnerable during peak-risk periods by improving or ensuring food security. Therefore, adapting the planting and production time in these hazardprone areas at peak-risk periods could limit losses and increase communities’ resilience...|$|R

The purpose of the study conducted from December 2001 through February 2002 was to collect data needed to facilitate the design of a partnership program involving Mpongwe Development Company (MDC) that would enable the adoption of sustainable, environmentally friendly agricultural practices by the <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> in Mpongwe District, Zambia. Eleven separate surveys were conducted to gather descriptive information from four groups: 210 <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers,</b> traditional chiefs, government departments, and MDC. Substantial developmental work continues in Mpongwe. More than 50 % of the <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> were aware of development organizations. The extension service and MDC both enjoyed relatively high awareness by farmers at 82. 3 % and 87. 4 %, respectively. The extent of the effectiveness of this work is still unknown because the scope of the study was only to identify areas of possible developmental collaboration. The recently constructed highway and the government Intermediate Means of Transport (IMT) program has opened the District to many development opportunities. To establish guidelines for the proposed collaborative program mission and goals, three key emerging areas were identified. They were finance, organization, and technical assistance. Only 21. 4 % of the <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> reported being in arrears. About 79. 1 % of participating farmer sales consisted of roadside sales with about two percent selling through cooperatives. Only 44 % of <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> reported being members of co-operatives. The only crop reported by the <b>small-scale</b> <b>farmers</b> as being grown in areas greater than one hectare was maize (84. 7 %).
