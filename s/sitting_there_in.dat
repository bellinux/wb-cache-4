5|$|I was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> {{the theater}} at the back, showing {{it to people}} for the first time. I mean, {{it was like a}} puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
5|$|It was {{possible}} {{to look into the}} back yard from the road...the corpses in British uniform were lying in the yard near the buildings. They were lying in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine-gun bursts. It struck me at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them...I took pictures of the dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed at the disposal of the division...I believe I was already <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the vehicle when Thum...told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap, from which he had {{come to the conclusion that}} a summary trial had taken place.|$|E
500|$|... "Eat, Pray, Queef" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker. It first aired on April 1, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. Although Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone acknowledged it was a particularly juvenile episode, Parker said it was his favorite show of the season to produce. He said, [...] "I seriously never laughed as hard doing retakes, just going shot-by-shot, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the editing room laughing." [...] During the writing process, the female producers and employees with the show found the script largely unfunny, disgusting and offensive. They reportedly claimed vaginal flatulence would not bloom into a proud women's movement {{as it did in the}} episode, but Parker and Stone insisted that was what made the concept even funnier.|$|E

5000|$|Tony {{listens to}} [...] "Bell Bottom Blues" [...] by Derek and the Dominos {{on his new}} {{entertainment}} center. He comments that [...] "it's like Clapton's <b>sitting</b> right <b>there</b> <b>in</b> your house." ...|$|R
500|$|Pierre Sévigny, {{who would}} be elected an MP in 1958, {{recalled}} the gathering, [...] "When he had finished that speech, as he was walking to the door, I saw people kneel and kiss his coat. Not one, but many. People were in tears. People were delirious. And this happened many a time after." [...] When Sévigny introduced Diefenbaker to a Montreal rally with the words [...] "Levez-vous, levez-vous, saluez votre chef!" [...] (Rise, rise, salute your chief!) according to Postmaster General William Hamilton [...] "thousands and thousands of people, jammed into that auditorium, just tore the roof off in a frenzy." [...] Michael Starr remembered, [...] "That was the most fantastic election... I went into little places. Smoky Lake, Alberta, where nobody ever saw a minister. Canora, Saskatchewan. Every meeting was jammed... The halls would be filled with people and <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the front {{would be the first}} Ukrainian immigrants with shawls and hands gnarled from work... I would switch to Ukrainian and the tears would start to run down their faces... I don't care who says what won the election; it was the emotional aspect that really caught on." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'When {{the kid is}} <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the base, I didn't do it, {{but nobody}} is {{thinking}} {{of him as a}} kid, you know—if there is someone blindfolded and handcuffed, he's probably done something really bad. It's OK to slap him, it's OK to spit on him, it's OK to kick him sometimes. It doesn't really matter.' ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{particularly}} brutal session {{took place}} at Satellite Park Studio in Malibu. [...] "It was like a month of, we'd basically broken up, fired Bob , he quit {{and then there were}} those times where it was like, 'Oh my God, that's magic, how do we get more of that?'" [...] Maida even quit once after firing Rock at a group meeting. [...] "For me that was pretty much it. I was pretty much done with the band [...] [...] [...] It was really dark," [...] Maida Noted. Pressure was also coming from the band's management and the record company, who continued to fund the band's sessions. Raine commented, “I think we were at, like, 35 songs, and we all sat in a room and said, ‘Yeah, but there’s only eight that we all like.’ Everyone’s really frustrated.... And I think Bob had even lost perspective at this point. We’re <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> this shitty little studio in Malibu, and it just got a little aggressive and agitated in the room." ...|$|E
6000|$|Quite by chance, Dschemil {{happened}} to pass by, and seeing a man <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> full <b>in</b> {{the glare of}} the sun, he stopped, and said, 'Get up at once, Jew; you will have a sunstroke if you sit in such a place.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You do {{not think}} it now,' he said; and as I looked up into his clear eyes I was ashamed of myself, and could only murmur, what could I think when I saw him <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> aiding <b>in</b> their cruel manoeuvres, --all for your own sake, too? ...|$|R
60|$|Then I tossed him peanuts, {{throwing}} them first far away, then nearer and nearer till {{he would come}} to my window-sill. And when I woke one morning he was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> looking <b>in</b> at the window, waiting for me to get up and bring his breakfast.|$|R

[...] Shevlin met the 17-year-old Sherley in 1905, and she attended all of Yale's football games in the fall of 1905.

2500|$|Reiss {{has contributed}} to {{numerous}} film screenplays. He wrote several jokes for the film Ice Age after The Simpsons colleague David Silverman asked him and Jon Vitti to help out with the film's story issues. He later wrote a number of screenplays including [...] and Horton Hears a Who!. The first live-action film he wrote was 2009's My Life in Ruins, starring Nia Vardalos. Reiss initially wrote the film, {{which was based on}} his experience on holiday bus tours of Mexico and Greece, as a short story. After it was rejected by 37 publishers he rewrote it as a screenplay and sent it to Vardalos who [...] "snatched it right up". The film garnered a negative critical response with Roger Ebert, for example, stating [...] "there is, in short, nothing I liked about My Life in Ruins, except some of the ruins" [...] and calling Reiss' script [...] "lousy". Reiss defended the film: [...] "My Life in Ruins really makes people happy. It's a relentlessly sweet movie about the basic decency of humanity. It's happy ending kicks in around the 30-minute mark and continues for the next hour. I know those [...] were <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> that audience. They were sitting there going, 'These 1,498 people were wrong and the two of us are correct.' It makes me a little nuts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> melancholy rectrospectatiousness," [...] he said, {{indicating}} the logs, and again a swift thoughtfulness swept across her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "It’s {{all very}} well for you <b>sitting</b> up <b>there</b> <b>in</b> peace and comfort," [...] said the mate indignantly. [...] "I’m {{not going to be}} tarred to please you. Come down and take charge of your ship." ...|$|R
60|$|And so, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> hand <b>in</b> hand, {{we waited}} for the dawn, {{speaking}} many sad and tender words to one another; and at last, when we parted, I held her once more unresisting to my breast, thinking, as she did, that our separation would be an eternal one.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} {{good of you to}} sit up for us, Mr. Purfleet," [...] Bob said, quietly; [...] "but you see, we had left the door open, and could have got in by ourselves. I hope you will not have caught cold, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> only <b>in</b> a {{dressing}} gown." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{turned out}} that the report was true. Joan had relapsed. She was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> her chains, clothed again in her male attire.|$|E
60|$|They {{all heard}} it. Sammy Jay heard it, too, and {{scratched}} {{himself to be}} sure that he was awake and <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the big pine-tree.|$|E
60|$|On {{reaching}} the passage, he {{looked through the}} open door of his little parlor and saw Frank <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> idle wretchedness, with his head resting wearily on his hand.|$|E
60|$|The {{time of day}} {{was four}} o'clock in the afternoon. The place was the lady's study or boudoir, Knapwater House. The person was Miss Aldclyffe <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> alone, clothed <b>in</b> deep mourning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Sam," [...] she gasped, [...] "old Jerome Irving and Aunt Anne are <b>sitting</b> round <b>there</b> <b>in</b> {{the dark}} {{on the front}} porch and he had his arms around her, kissing her! And they never saw nor heard me, no more'n if they were deaf and blind!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{door of the}} drawing-room was ajar, so that Lady Fitzgerald, who was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> tranquilly <b>in</b> her own seat, {{could hear}} the voice. And she did hear it, and knew that some {{stranger}} had come to trouble her husband. But she did not come forth; why should she? was not Herbert there--if, indeed, even Herbert could be of any service? ...|$|R
60|$|So Parson Jones, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the {{slanting}} light, {{read through}} these terrible records of piracy, and Tom, with {{the pile of}} gold and silver money beside him, sat and listened to him.|$|E

60|$|It {{is uncomfortable}} {{to sleep in}} a chair. But it is more uncomfortable to lie in bed, hour after hour, and not sleep, and to know that he is <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the cold darkness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes, sir!" [...] he {{answered}} with a somewhat mysterious air. [...] "Mr. Laverick was <b>sitting</b> over <b>there</b> <b>in</b> an easy-chair until about half-an-hour ago. Then two gentle-men arrived in a taxicab and inquired for him. They talked for a little time, and finally Mr. Laverick went away with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes,” said Mrs Verloc, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> {{against him}} <b>in</b> the hansom all rigid with the dread of the gallows {{and the fear}} of death. “Yes, Tom.” And she added to herself, like an awful refrain: “The drop given was {{fourteen}} feet.” ...|$|R
60|$|But {{about this}} silent {{creature}} <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> so motionless, <b>in</b> the dark, <b>there</b> seemed a warmth, a hidden fervour of feeling, {{as if the}} whole of her being had been stirred, and some change were taking place in its very depths.|$|R
60|$|Gertrude went to {{her sister}} and led her away, and Felix having passed his arm into Mr. Brand's and {{stepped out of the}} long window with him, the old man was left <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> unillumined perplexity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh God!" [...] his {{companion}} murmured; and, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> her ripe freshness, she had recourse {{to the same}} gesture she had provoked on Isabel's part in the morning: she bent her face and covered it with her hands.|$|E
60|$|But not as she did. She {{had better}} {{have been dead}} than laugh as she did, in reply, with her intent look fixed upon him. He had better have been dead, than <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> his magnificence, to hear her.|$|E
60|$|He {{loved to}} light the candles at the organ, and <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> alone <b>in</b> the little glow, {{practice}} the hymns and chants for the service. The whitewashed arches retreated into darkness, {{the sound of the}} organ and the organ-pedals died away upon the unalterable stillness of the church, there were faint, ghostly noises in the tower, and then the music swelled out again, loudly, triumphantly.|$|R
6000|$|In a {{few moments}} we reached the [...] "Rose and Crown" [...] and walked {{straight}} into the little parlour at the back. Miss Milly was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> by herself <b>in</b> semi-darkness, with a very disconsolate face. She brightened up, however, at our entrance.|$|R
5000|$|... "Tweeter and the Monkey Man" [...] {{was really}} by Tom Petty and Bob Dylan.
