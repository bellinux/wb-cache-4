25|$|On October 27, 2012, Von Eerie {{returned}} to Shimmer, losing to Yumi Ohka on Volume 49. Later {{that same day}} on Volume 50, <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> biggest win in Shimmer, defeating Cherry Bomb, Kalamity and Ryo Mizunami in a four-way match.

25|$|Victoria Azarenka {{won three}} titles this year. <b>She</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> second Sony Ericsson Open trophy after {{defeating}} Maria Sharapova {{in the final}} 6–1, 6–4 and upsetting 2nd seed Kim Clijsters and 3rd seed Vera Zvonareva earlier. She then won her first clay title the following week at the Andalucia Tennis Experience, defeating Irina-Camelia Begu in the final 6–3, 6–2. She then claimed a title before the championships at the BGL Luxembourg Open defeating Monica Niculescu 6–2, 6–2.

25|$|<b>She</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> {{first victory}} on the edition of September 17 of Impact! by {{defeating}} Cody Deaner in an intergender Lumberjack match. The win, though, was {{largely due to}} interference {{from all the other}} Knockouts who were lumberjacks. Frustrated at her lack of meaningful victories, Flash interrupted an interview with newcomer Hamada by voicing her frustration at the lack of fanfare her arrival in the company received in comparison to foreign Knockouts Sarita and Hamada. Flash then began to brawl with Hamada, throwing her down the bleachers of the empty arena. The two met weeks later on October 8 Impact! in an eight-woman elimination tag team match; when both were legal members in the ring they brawled out onto the floor until they were counted out and eliminated. The following week on Super Impact! the two met in a Falls Count Anywhere match which Flash lost after taking a moonsault from Hamada through a table. She finally scored an unassisted singles win on November 12 against Traci Brooks. After not being used by the company thereafter, Anderson requested her release which was granted on January 21, 2010. On March 14, 2011, at the tapings of the edition of March 17 of Impact!, Anderson, as Alissa Flash, made a one night return to TNA, unsuccessfully challenging Madison Rayne for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship as part of her open challenge series. On March 17, 2013, Anderson made another one night return to TNA {{to take part in the}} taping of the Knockout Knockdown pay-per-view, where she, as Alissa Flash, was defeated by Gail Kim.|$|E

25|$|The novel then {{jumps to}} 1923 with Virginia Woolf waking one {{morning with the}} {{possible}} first line of a new novel. She carefully navigates {{her way through the}} morning, so as not to lose <b>her</b> inspiration. When <b>she</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> pen, <b>she</b> writes: Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.|$|R

June is Jansen's girlfriend as well, but their {{relationship}} is still only social, and there's nothing {{to work with}} - {{but in the process}} of following her, Ben has become attracted to June.|$|R

25|$|Cindy Campbell, now {{a blonde}} news reporter, announces the crop circles on the news. <b>She</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> paranormally endowed nephew Cody from school, where {{her best friend}} Brenda Meeks is his teacher. George <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> his niece Sue, {{who is in the}} same class. Cindy and George fall in love, and George invites her and Brenda to a rap-battle with his rapper friends Mahalik and CJ. George proves to be talented but is disqualified for unintentional racist blunders.|$|R

2500|$|Medora is alone, {{and anxious}} for Corrado's return. <b>She</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> harp and sings a beautiful, but vaguely {{sinister}} aria; some sixth sense {{seems to be}} telling her that things are bound to turn out badly: Non so le tetre immagini / [...] "Dark forebodings I cannot banish from my thoughts". When Corrado finally arrives, the two sing a duet that captures both the serenity of their love and the uncertainty of their future. Medora pleads with Corrado not to leave, but finally he departs to confront the Pasha.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him through and through a moment longer. Then, seeming {{satisfied}} with her scrutiny, <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> pail.|$|E
6000|$|... "Davy," [...] she cried, [...] "be happy while you're young. 'Tis a fine day, and Kaintuckee's over yonder." [...] <b>She</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> {{skirts and}} sang:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Then, {{confronted with}} a double astonishment, and having no more to say, <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> skirt quite unnecessarily, and walked with a heavenward chin indoors.|$|E
50|$|Binder {{returned}} to Germany in 1950, settling in Düsseldorf, where <b>she</b> successfully <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> stage career {{but did not}} attempt to break into the German film industry. She died on 30 June 1962, aged 67.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1983, a twelve-year-old girl, Hera Karlsdottir, lives a normal life on her family farm in a close-knit community. This changes once she watches her older brother Baldur fall off a tractor before his long hair is scalped by its blades. He is rushed out by the family by truck for medical attention, but he dies of his injury. At his funeral, Hera glares at the {{portrait}} of Jesus {{on the wall and}} runs out of the church during the service. Returning home, <b>she</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> brother's guitar and immediately adopts his metal music and fashion, burning all of her old clothes.|$|R
60|$|She shifted sharply, {{she knocked}} him as <b>she</b> pretended to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> glove, <b>she</b> groped among his feet.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned and}} strode away. Both Beatrice and Tavernake watched {{him until he}} disappeared. Then, with a sigh, <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> skirts with her right hand, and took Tavernake's arm.|$|E
60|$|The {{postmistress}} made tedious explanations that Letty did {{not seem}} to hear. She stared straight in front of her at nothing. Then in a pause in the conversation <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> parcel.|$|E
60|$|Without a word <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> fur, put it on, {{and stood}} {{waiting for him}} to speak. Then, as he did not, she held out {{something}} white. It was the card for the dance.|$|E
50|$|In shock, <b>she</b> simply <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> {{coat and}} leaves for the party. She sits alone, {{watching}} Jay dance with another woman, until finally Jay asks in brutal terms {{what is the}} matter. She takes him home to show him the problem.|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> on <b>her</b> earlier {{educational}} {{talents and}} studying for a politics degree at Lancaster University. At the final stage, however, she fell ill with Alzheimer's disease and her {{last four years}} were spent in a Chesterfield nursing home. She was survived by her three sons and a daughter.|$|R
50|$|After Rebecca is {{captured}} by Glenn Arias, Arias reveals that he desires to marry Rebecca because she resembles his late lover, Sara, {{who was killed}} on their wedding day during a terrorist attack. Arias is stopped by Chris and Leon after he becomes fatally wounded and merges with his subordinate Diego into a Tyrant creature to go after Chris, and Rebecca is cured just in time, after Arias exposed her to a stronger strain of his virus, {{that had to be}} treated within 30 minutes. She then departs in a helicopter with her fellow heroes, but Arias' associate Maria (Diego's daughter) is revealed to have survived, when <b>she</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> father's silver mask, indicating that a sequel could be imminent.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> parasol {{from the}} trunk, and after {{standing}} regarding {{him for a}} moment with an air of offended maidenhood, walked back to the town. Bassett, after a long interval, returned by another road.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> {{skirts and}} ran, ran so lightly and swiftly that Cecil, who {{was taken by}} surprise, had no chance of {{catching}} her. From the hall door {{she looked back at}} him, panting behind.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{shall we}} do with the other four berries?" [...] asked Trot, as <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> sunbonnet, marveling that she had ever been small enough to ride in it. [...] "They're no good to us now, are they, Cap'n?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh--oh--oh!" [...] groaned Mab, as <b>she</b> {{stooped to}} <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> work and thimble. [...] "I wish I had three wounded conscripts {{to take care}} of." ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{imperative}} to note that, of the two protagonists, Mrs. Slade does not even knit, while Mrs. Ansley seems devoted to the craft. As the story progresses, one can even make a correlation between Mrs. Ansley’s mental state {{and the way in}} which she handles her needles and skeins. When she is nervous, <b>she</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> project cautiously, as if to draw as little attention as possible. However, something even as simple as the way she stores her work, crimson silk being “run through” by her needles elicits a very provocative response in the reader. The switch between a “half guilty” extraction of her work to the subtle provocation of the passionate color and style of materials chosen changes the element of knitting from one of complacency to one of increasing complexity.|$|R
6000|$|Now behold {{her with}} her hands thrown to heaven, and hear the wild shriek [...] "Madonna!" [...] through all the hubbub. But <b>she</b> <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> two skirt-knees, and with her thin legs in grey {{stockings}} starts with a mad rush after the train. In vain. The train inexorably pursues its course. Prancing, she reaches {{one end of the}} platform as we leave the other end. Then she realizes {{it is not going to}} stop for her. And then, oh horror, her long arms thrown out in wild supplication after the retreating train: then flung aloft to God: then brought down in absolute despair on her head. And this is the last sight we have of her, clutching her poor head in agony and doubling forward. She is left--she is abandoned.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{like you}} very much, Kilmeny," [...] {{answered}} Eric, laughing a little; {{but there was}} in his voice a tender note {{of which he was}} unconscious. Kilmeny was aware of it, however, and <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> violin with a pleased smile.|$|E
6000|$|The Butterfly's Wife {{looked at}} Balkis, {{and saw the}} most {{beautiful}} Queen's eyes shining like deep pools with starlight on them, and <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> courage with both wings and said, 'O Queen, be lovely for ever. You know what men-folk are like.' ...|$|E
60|$|This last {{sound was}} made by the soft mud beside the garage as Mother landed in it. She had jumped from the roof without once hesitating, and <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> bundle and waited quite calmly till Father came flying frog-like through the mist.|$|E
50|$|Born {{and raised}} in Sydenham, Lewisham in London, Charlene Soraia grew <b>up</b> with <b>her</b> parents. <b>She</b> first <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> father's guitar {{at the age of}} 5, and played her first show at 8. She was {{inspired}} by artists such as David Bowie, The Beatles, Pink Floyd and King Crimson, and was very interested in the prog-rock genre.|$|R
50|$|Haas {{also was}} an avid fly fisher—a hobby <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> from <b>her</b> husband. <b>She</b> co-authored a book with Gwen Cooper, Wade a Little Deeper, Dear: A Woman's Guide to Fly Fishing in 1979, which became a classic among fly fishers. It {{was one of the}} first books to {{encourage}} women to take up the sport.|$|R
60|$|She {{had dropped}} {{her work in}} her lap; her hands were crossed upon it, her head thrown a little back. She had evidently {{expected}} a more impersonal answer, and she was dissatisfied. For an instant she seemed inclined to make a rejoinder, but <b>she</b> slowly <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> work in silence and drew her stitches again.|$|R
