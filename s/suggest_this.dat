5|$|Nettlecombe Park is {{important}} for its lichen flora. Records <b>suggest</b> <b>this</b> site has been wood pasture or parkland for at least 400 years. There are some very old oak pollards which may be of this age or older. The oldest standard trees are over 200 years of age. The continuity of open woodland and parkland, with large mature and over-mature timber, has enabled characteristic species of epiphytic lichens and beetles to become established and persist. Many of the species in the park are now nationally scarce because this type of habitat has been eliminated over large areas of Great Britain. The park was notified as an SSSI in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The {{performers}} {{were allowed}} to improvise provided that they maintained factual accuracy. Howick said that improvisation was actually often necessary due to the rapid-fire pace of filming, which left very little {{time to prepare for}} individual roles.

5|$|James then flew to Algiers, {{where he}} was {{publicly}} paraded through the airport and driven to meet General Maitland Wilson, ostensibly for a meeting to discuss operations against the south of France. Instead, he was moved quietly to a remote villa by 'A' Force's Rex Hamer. Rumours <b>suggest</b> <b>this</b> was because James had been spotted smoking and staggering around Algiers, so the deceivers decided to cut his appearances short. Whatever the reason, the next day, out of character, James was flown to Cairo. He was to remain hidden there until the public disclosure of Montgomery's presence in France. Meanwhile, double agents in North Africa were used to extend the masquerade {{for a few more}} days, by hinting Montgomery was still in the region.|$|E

5|$|Pattle was {{a fighter}} ace {{with a high}} score, and is {{sometimes}} noted as being the highest-scoring British Commonwealth pilot of the war. If all claims made for him are correct, his total {{could have been more}} than 51. It can be stated that his final total was at least 40 and could exceed this number. Log-books and semi-official records <b>suggest</b> <b>this</b> figure, while personnel attached to his squadron suspect the figure to be closer to 60. A total of 26 of Pattle's victims were Italian; 15 were downed with Gloster Gladiators, the rest with Hawker Hurricanes. He is considered to be the highest-scoring ace on both Gladiator and Hurricane (35 victories) fighters.|$|E
5|$|The Pondicherry shark {{appears to}} have been broadly {{distributed}} in the Indo-Pacific. It may have once been common, as it was reportedly a regular catch off India and Pakistan, but is now extremely rare. Most of the known specimens were collected from India, with more specimens from the Gulf of Oman, Borneo, and Java. There are also less reliable records from the South China Sea, other parts of Southeast Asia such as Vietnam and the Philippines, New Guinea, and northern Australia. This species inhabits inshore waters. Several older sources reported that it could be found in rivers such as the Hooghli River and the Saigon River. These reports may have confused a river shark (Glyphis sp.) for the Pondicherry shark; if accurate, they would <b>suggest</b> <b>this</b> species to be tolerant of low salinity. As of 2016, these reports have been confirmed; the only documented Pondicherry sharks in the 21st century were found in the Sri Lankan Menik River.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} storylines, Josh {{tries to}} end a deadlock on {{the appointment of a}} 6th Circuit federal court judge. His old friend Eric Hayden (Gaston) has been waiting for a year for confirmation from the Republican-led Congress, and is offered the position of dean of Georgetown's law school. But Josh suggests making a temporary recess appointment that will at least put the issue on the agenda and Hayden agrees. When Josh goes to <b>suggest</b> <b>this</b> to Leo he is told that the issue will have to wait for one of the Supreme Court justices has died. Assuming it is the ailing Chief Justice Roy Ashland that has passed, Josh is surprised to learn that it is 52-year old Justice Owen Brady, taken by a heart attack. C.J., meanwhile, tries to make things right with resurfaced college boyfriend Ben, whom she has been forced to ignore due to her workload. Based on Ben's reaction {{at the end of their}} very brief conversation, C.J. regrets her approach and fears that she may have caused things with Ben to end before they could even begin. Upon voicing this concern to Toby he advices her to go to Ben and fix it. Ryan Pierce, the intern working for Josh, (uncharacteristically) fails to show up for work. Josh had failed to even notice until Donna voices her concern as she tries, unsuccessfully, to get a hold of Ryan.|$|E

5|$|Karl Marx {{distinguished}} {{social classes}} by their {{connection to the}} means of production in the capitalist system: the bourgeoisie own the means, but this effectively includes the proletariat itself as the workers can only sell their own labour power (forming the material base of the cultural superstructure). Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism, arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. patriarchy). According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables: (1) Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat. (2) Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth. and (3) Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, <b>suggest</b> <b>this</b> effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries.|$|E
5|$|The Maharaja of Patiala again invited Kilner to {{play and}} coach in India {{in the winter of}} 1927–28. Kilner's sister Mollie later said he was very {{reluctant}} to take up the invitation and hesitated before accepting. The trip started badly when Kilner's uncle, Irving Washington, died the day after he departed, and several of Kilner's actions <b>suggest</b> <b>this</b> triggered some form of depression. Even so, Kilner recorded several large scores, including an unbeaten 283 in one (non first-class) match. Near the end of trip, he began to suffer from a fever. His Yorkshire team mates, Arthur Dolphin and Maurice Leyland, who were also in India, believed he became unwell after eating oysters, but it is not certain how or when Kilner became ill. He began to have shivering attacks and perspiration while travelling from Marseilles on the way home. It was obvious he was seriously ill when he arrived in Southampton; a cricketing engagement was cancelled and he was confined to bed. He refused treatment in Southampton, wishing to return to his family, and asking for his wife. Arriving in Wombwell on 27 March 1928, he was examined by his doctor and taken home. Subsequently, his condition deteriorated and he was taken to Kendray Fever Hospital, near Barnsley. Although it was thought he had passed the worst, his condition became critical in {{the first few days of}} April. On 5 April 1928, Kilner died from enteric fever in the presence of his wife.|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} of the game was co-developed by Square Enix and HexaDrive, a company created by former Capcom staff members. As the new form of The 3rd Birthday had {{transformed}} into a third-person shooter, Square Enix wanted staff members with experience at developing such games, and then-company CEO Yoichi Wada recommended HexaDrive to Tabata. As multiple HexaDrive staff members had also worked on fellow shooter , Tabata agreed to the collaboration. While aiming for a high quality product, the team designed the game as if for the PlayStation 3 home console, then worked to fit it onto the PSP. During development, the team sought creative help from the team developing Final Fantasy XIII for the visual design. The team had previous experimented with shooters with , but this time they wanted to create something closer to a third-person shooter. The team was assembled by Tabata based on their development experience with action games. While working inside the control and hardware limitations of the title, the team created firearms and the lock-on mechanic as the fundamental attack action, instead of the free-roaming style of a standard third-person shooter. While designing levels to function with the game's Overdive system, the team considered what the level would hold, how often players would utilize the function, the difficulty of levels, and the positioning and strength of enemies. During development, a questionnaire was circulated around company staff concerning the character Aya, to find out which of the planned features was popular. One of those that survived in the final game was Aya's clothes being damaged when she was hit by an enemy, which was used to emphasize her sexuality. Nomura {{was among the first to}} <b>suggest</b> <b>this</b> feature originally.|$|E
