5|$|Financial Times {{questioned}} why the Japanese auditor firm <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{financial statements}} {{in the same year}} when other members of its global network apparently refused to give clean bills of financial heath to Olympus subsidiaries such as Gyrus in the UK, and elsewhere. One analyst suggests the poor performance of Japanese auditors may be due to low pay, and overwork due to the shortage of certified public accountants: audit fees are up to one-fifth of that of comparable US companies; there are 17,000 CPAs in Japan, compared with 330,000 in the US.|$|E
5|$|Jaguar's {{marketing}} department had allocated space on their {{stand at the}} motor show for the XJ220, but {{had not seen the}} vehicle until its arrival. Jaguar chairman John Egan and Roger Putnam, {{who was in charge of}} Jaguar's racing activities, were shown the vehicle the week before the motor show and <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> concept, allowing its unveiling. The car received an overwhelmingly positive reception by public and press, and a number of wealthy Jaguar enthusiasts handed over blank cheques to secure a purchase option should the XJ220 concept go into production. Ferrari's display of their F40 model at the same event was overshadowed; an estimated 90,000 additional visitors came to see the Jaguar XJ220.|$|E

According to the inquiry, Wood had previously indicated in conversation that he was aware that the roof was at risk of caving in, but altered his final report at Nazarian's request so that the structural issues did not jeopardize the building's refinancing. His trial began in September 2016.|$|E

5|$|The Court of King's Bench did {{act as an}} appellate body, hearing appeals {{from the}} Court of Common Pleas, eyre circuits, assize courts and local courts, but was not a court of last resort; its own records were sent to Parliament to be <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> {{creation}} of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in 1585 created a court from which King's Bench decisions could be appealed to, and with {{the expansion of the}} Exchequer Chamber's jurisdiction in 1830 the King's Bench ceased to be an appellate court. Thanks to the Bill of Westminster and other legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought.|$|E
5|$|No great {{compromise}} reached Taylor's desk {{during his}} presidency; instead, his last days were {{overshadowed by the}} Galphin affair. Before joining the Taylor cabinet, Secretary of War Crawford {{had served as a}} lawyer. He had been involved in a fifteen-year case, representing the descendants of a colonial trader whose services to the British crown had not been repaid {{at the time of the}} American Revolution. The British debt to George Galphin was to be assumed by the federal government, but Galphin's heirs only received payment on the debt's principal after years of litigation, and were unable to win an interest payment from the Polk administration. Treasury Secretary Meredith, with the support of Attorney General Johnson, finally <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> payment in April 1850. To the president's embarrassment, this payment included a legal compensation of nearly $100,000 to Crawford; two cabinet members had effectively offered a tremendous chunk of the public treasury to another. A House investigation cleared Crawford of any legal wrongdoing, but nonetheless expressed disapproval of his accepting the payment. Taylor, who had already been sketching out a re-organization of his cabinet, now had an unfolding scandal to complicate the situation.|$|E

Members of each organization approved the merger in April and May, 1999, and a founding convention was held in June 2000.

After meeting with his staff, Goodson offered Dawson a contract to return as host of the syndicated Feud and the semi-retired Dawson agreed to return.

[...] The purchase was made for $640,000 on September 21, 1832 and contained an area of some 6 million acres (24,000km²), at a price equivalent to 11 cents/acre (26 $/km²). Although named after the defeated chief Black Hawk, he was being held prisoner by the US. Sauk chief Keokuk, who had remained neutral in the war, <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> purchase. It was made on the site of present-day Davenport.

500|$|From the 1980s to {{the present}} there have been {{multiple}} accounting scandals that were widely reported on {{by the media and}} resulted in fraud charges, bankruptcy protection requests, and the closure of companies and accounting firms. The scandals were the result of creative accounting, misleading financial analysis, as well as bribery. Various companies had issues with fraudulent accounting practices, including Nugan Hand Bank, Phar-Mor, WorldCom, and AIG. One of the most widely reported violation of accounting ethics involved Enron, a multinational company, that for several years had not shown a true or fair view of their financial statements. Their auditor Arthur Andersen, an accounting firm considered one of the [...] "Big Five", <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> validity of the accounts despite the inaccuracies in the financial statements.

At no point were any major issues signalled by the company's auditors; The Financial Times (FT) reported that KPMG had raised some questions when the firm audited Olympus, but audit reports were always unqualified, and E signed off on [...] "clean" [...] audit reports in 2010 and 2011. According to an email sent by former chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa that Michael Woodford made public, Olympus had replaced KPMG with E after the former expressed disagreement with the accounting treatment of the Gyrus acquisition.

500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the duo sought to give Comedy Central {{executives}} {{an idea of}} what the series would be like and how each show could differ from the others. Parker and Stone also said they would not write another script until the network <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> full show with a season of at least six episodes. Comedy Central liked the script and agreed to commit to a series. While [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" [...] was created almost entirely with construction paper, [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] was the first South Park episode made completely using computers.

500|$|While {{the studio}} was {{receiving}} positive critical reviews, it was struggling financially. In March 1947, rumors began to circulate regarding the company being {{taken over by}} one of the major studios. The studio's next film, State of the Union, starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, was scheduled to be distributed by MGM. [...] In addition to the MGM deal with Capra, Briskin sought out distribution deals with other major studios, including Paramount. The partners sought a major studio to buy Liberty Films before bank foreclosure, although Wyler and Stevens were [...] "violently opposed" [...] to the idea at first. In April rumors began to circulate that a deal was in the offing for a sale of the company to Paramount Pictures. Those rumors were confirmed the following month when Paramount bought Liberty. The four partners were given a total of between $3,450,000 and $4,000,000 in Paramount stock, and Capra, Wyler, and Stevens were offered five-picture contracts at Paramount. Briskin was given a studio executive position at Paramount which was specifically created for him, but Stevens decided not to accept the Paramount offer and continued as an independent producer. The deal took several months to reach fruition, finally culminating when the US Treasury <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tax setup in September 1947.

500|$|According to {{a letter}} filed with the UK Registrar of Companies, the {{auditors}} to Gyrus resigned [...] "partly because of its client's accounting for the securities". KPMG qualified Gyrus' accounts {{because they could not}} ascertain that Axam was not a related party. The auditors also took issue with the accounting treatment of the preference shares. In its audit letter to Gyrus Group dated 26 April 2010, KPMG considered that there were [...] "circumstances connected with our ceasing to hold office that should be {{brought to the attention of}} the company's members or creditors." [...] Ernst & Young, the firm that succeeded KPMG, also expressed reservations about the 2010 Gyrus accounts for uncertainty, due to the lack of information about Axam. Bloomberg noted that both Gyrus annual reports were filed late: instead of filing within the nine-month statutory limit, the accounts were filed more than a year from the company's year end. In late November 2011 Michael Andrew, KPMG International global chairman, said his firm had complied with its legal obligations to pass on information related to Olympus's 2008 acquisition of Gyrus, and were removed as auditors for so doing. Andrew said: [...] "It's pretty evident to me there was very, very significant fraud and that a number of parties had been complicit." [...] However, the while the Japanese firm forced a ¥71 billion restatement of dubious valuation of certain acquired assets, the firm <b>signed</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> financial statements in the same year that contained questionable figures other members of its global network in UK and elsewhere had apparently expressed grave reservations over.|$|E
