25|$|Asphalt {{was used}} {{starting}} in the 1960s as an hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds. Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alpha-emitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in France, Belgium and Japan, but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues (risks of fire, as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan) and long-term stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations. One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation {{because of the presence}} of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis. A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a semi-permeable membrane. This also causes the matrix to swell. The <b>swelling</b> <b>pressure</b> due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as selenium, technetium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded anions. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging.|$|E

40|$|The {{geological}} {{storage of}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) is a well-studied technology, {{and a number of}} demonstration projects around the world have proven its feasibility and challenges. Storage conformance and seal integrity are among the most important aspects, as they determine risk of leakage as well as limits for storage capacity and injectivity. Furthermore, providing evidence for safe storage is critical for improving public acceptance. Most caprocks are composed of clays as dominant mineral type which can typically be illite, kaolinite, chlorite or smectite. A number of recent studies addressed the interaction between CO 2 and these different clays and it was shown that clay minerals adsorb considerable quantities of CO 2. For smectite this uptake can lead to volumetric expansion followed by the generation of <b>swelling</b> <b>pressures.</b> On the one hand CO 2 adsorption traps CO 2, on the other hand <b>swelling</b> <b>pressures</b> can potentially change local stress regimes and in unfavourable situations shear-type failure is assumed to occur. For storage in a reservoir having high clay contents the CO 2 uptake can add to storage capacity which is widely underestimated so far. Smectite-rich seals in direct contact with a dry CO 2 plume at the interface to the reservoir might dehydrate leading to dehydration cracks. Such dehydration cracks can provide pathways for CO 2 ingress and further accelerate dewatering and penetration of the seal by supercritical CO 2. At the same time, swelling may also lead to the closure of fractures or the reduction of fracture apertures, thereby improving seal integrity. The goal of this communication is to theoretically evaluate and discuss these scenarios in greater detail in terms of phenomenological mechanisms, but also in terms of potential risks or benefits for carbon storage...|$|R

This paper aims to give an overview of the swelling characteristic of bentonites with particular observations from that of prehydrated clay mats.

Accordingly, it examines the swelling response of the clay mat and the pressure exerted when the swelling is both fully and partially restrained.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of surgery: open surgery which is {{mentioned}} above and percutaneous surgery. Unlike open surgery percutaneous surgery is done without exposing the anatomical structures beneath the skin. Research has shown that percutaneous surgery is a good alternative to open surgery. Percutaneous surgery is done with a needle which is inserted in the flexor sheath {{at the level of the}} A1 pulley. Before the needle insertion the thumb is placed in extension, whereas when the needle is already inserted the thumb will be put into semi-flexion, so that the needle can be moved and the palmar skin is movable. The A1 pulley will then be cut with the needle longitudinally and parallel to the fibers of the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus muscle. When the release with the needle is done according to the pivot maneuver the chances of incomplete release and damage to the digital nerve nearby will be increased. To prevent any postoperative hematoma and <b>swelling,</b> <b>pressure</b> should be applied for at least 10 minutes after the procedure. Percutaneous surgery has also been proven to be without residual deformities and recurrence after surgery. When the A1 pulley is too thick and long to be released at once, open surgery still can be a solution. The advantages over open surgery are that percutaneous surgery is simpler, more straightforward and shorter concerning the duration. It can also be done in every other examination room unlike the open surgery, which is done in an operation room. The risk nonetheless is that the digital nerve of the thumb nearby can be damaged.|$|E

Accordingly, we assume they should fully perform the swelling functions under a restricted environment as well...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{summarizes}} first a set {{of field}} observations {{in connection with the}} severe heave experienced by Lilla tunnel excavated in a Tertiary anhydritic claystone. Heave and <b>swelling</b> <b>pressures</b> against the tunnel rigid lining were a consequence of gypsum crystal growth on discontinuities. This process requires water because gypsum crystals precipitate from supersaturated solutions of calcium sulfate. The paper concentrates on the precipitation of crystal in pores of varying geometry with the purpose of deriving theoretical expressions for the crystal pressure against the (assumed rigid) pore walls. The problem is solved by two complementary approaches: the thermodynamic requirements for the equilibrium of the chemical reaction of precipitation and the consideration of the surface energy at the crystal-solution interface. The phenomenon has strong similarities with other interfaces of interest in unsaturated soil mechanics which are highlighted. The expressions found for the crystal pressure are considered an upper bound for pressures likely to developPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: During site {{investigations}} for tunnel {{projects in}} swelling rocks {{one of the}} major tasks is to determine the swelling potential and the mineral composition of the material. When carried out in the laboratory, the sampling procedure is the main problem. Usually swelling rocks are very sensitive to changes in water content and stress state. Therefore it is more or less impossible to obtain undisturbed samples for proper laboratory testing. Even if treated with uttermost care, sample drawing produces tension release, small fissures, changes in water content etc. To avoid these problems, in 1993 Thuro suggested disturbing the samples completely by drying and grinding them. The generated powder is tested in a swelling cell called "Swellomat", measuring the swelling displacement of the material. One of the important advantages of this method is that, due to the consistent sample preparation, an almost perfect homogeneous material is produced. Moreover, compared with the original rock sample, the surface area of a powder is many times larger and, therefore, the test takes about ten times less time to obtain the desired results. On the other hand, some disadvantages are obvious: no natural undisturbed sample is used; therefore, no <b>swelling</b> <b>pressures</b> can be derived. Also, the comparability with the original rock mass may be difficult. Extensive investigations have been carried out testing parallel series of a variety of swelling materials with different <b>pressure</b> <b>swelling</b> tests (Huder & Amberg 1970 and Henke, Kaiser & Nagel 1975) to calibrate th...|$|R
