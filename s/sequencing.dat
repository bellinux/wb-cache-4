5|$|Advances in bioinformatics, {{refinements}} of DNA amplification, and {{the proliferation}} of computational power have greatly aided the analysis of DNA sequences recovered from environmental samples, allowing the adaptation of shotgun <b>sequencing</b> to metagenomic samples (known also as whole metagenome shotgun or WMGS <b>sequencing).</b> The approach, used to sequence many cultured microorganisms and the human genome, randomly shears DNA, sequences many short sequences, and reconstructs them into a consensus sequence. Shotgun <b>sequencing</b> reveals genes present in environmental samples. Historically, clone libraries were used to facilitate this <b>sequencing.</b> However, with advances in high throughput <b>sequencing</b> technologies, the cloning step is no longer necessary and greater yields of <b>sequencing</b> data can be obtained without this labour-intensive bottleneck step. Shotgun metagenomics provides information both about which organisms are present and what metabolic processes are possible in the community. Because the collection of DNA from an environment is largely uncontrolled, the most abundant organisms in an environmental sample are most highly represented in the resulting sequence data. To achieve the high coverage needed to fully resolve the genomes of under-represented community members, large samples, often prohibitively so, are needed. On the other hand, the random nature of shotgun <b>sequencing</b> ensures that many of these organisms, which would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional culturing techniques, will be represented by at least some small sequence segments.|$|E

5|$|The first metagenomic studies {{conducted}} using high-throughput <b>sequencing</b> used massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing. Three other technologies commonly applied to environmental sampling are the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine, the Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq and the Applied Biosystems SOLiD system. These techniques for <b>sequencing</b> DNA generate shorter fragments than Sanger sequencing; Ion Torrent PGM System and 454 pyrosequencing typically produces ~400bp reads, Illumina MiSeq produces 400-700bp reads (depending on whether paired end options are used), and SOLiD produce 25-75bp reads. Historically, these read lengths were significantly {{shorter than the}} typical Sanger <b>sequencing</b> read length of ~750bp, however the Illumina technology is quickly coming close to this benchmark. However, this limitation is compensated for by the much larger number of sequence reads. In 2009, pyrosequenced metagenomes generate 200–500megabases, and Illumina platforms generate around 20–50gigabases, but these outputs have increased by orders of magnitude in recent years. An additional advantage to high throughput <b>sequencing</b> is that this technique does not require cloning the DNA before <b>sequencing,</b> removing {{one of the main}} biases and bottlenecks in environmental sampling.|$|E
5|$|Autism has {{a strong}} genetic basis, {{although}} the genetics of autism are complex and {{it is unclear whether}} ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA <b>sequencing</b> but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes have been associated with autism through <b>sequencing</b> the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The present paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{constructing}} mutually orthogonal zero-correlation zone (MO-ZCZ) <b>sequence</b> sets using perfect <b>sequences,</b> orthogonal codes, and an interleaving technique. Generally, an MO-ZCZ <b>sequence</b> set {{is composed of}} several ZCZ <b>sequence</b> sets, and two arbitrary <b>sequences</b> that belong to different ZCZ <b>sequence</b> sets have orthogonality. Each ZCZ <b>sequence</b> set included in the proposed MO-ZCZ <b>sequence</b> set is a quasi-optimal ZCZ <b>sequence</b> set. In addition, two arbitrary <b>sequences</b> that belong to different ZCZ <b>sequence</b> sets have not only orthogonality but also a zerocorrelation zone of which the ZCZ length satisfies quasioptimality. Consequently, the proposed MO-ZCZ <b>sequence</b> set {{can be regarded as}} a single quasi-optimal ZCZ <b>sequence</b> set. In this sense, the proposed MO-ZCZ <b>sequence</b> set can be regarded as a generalized version of conventional MO-ZCZ <b>sequence</b> sets...|$|R

5|$|By the 1980s, protein <b>sequencing</b> {{had already}} {{transformed}} methods of scientific classification of organisms (especially cladistics) but biologists {{soon began to}} use RNA and DNA sequences as characters; this expanded the significance of molecular evolution within evolutionary biology, as the results of molecular systematics could be compared with traditional evolutionary trees based on morphology.

Into the 1990s, the five domains (Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, and Monerans) became three (the Archaea, the Bacteria, and the Eukarya) based on Carl Woese's pioneering molecular systematics work with 16S rRNA <b>sequencing.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these preventable issues, GWA studies have attracted more fundamental criticism, mainly because of their assumption that common genetic variation plays {{a large role in}} explaining the heritable variation of common disease. This aspect of GWA studies has attracted the criticism that, although it could not have been known prospectively, GWA studies were ultimately not worth the expenditure. Alternative strategies suggested involve linkage analysis. More recently, the rapidly decreasing price of complete genome <b>sequencing</b> have also provided a realistic alternative to genotyping array-based GWA studies. It can be discussed if the use of this new technique is still referred to as a GWA study, but high-throughput <b>sequencing</b> does have potential to side-step some of the shortcomings of non-sequencing GWA.|$|E
