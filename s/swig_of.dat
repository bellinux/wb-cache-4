500|$|Davies and Cornell {{debated whether}} {{it should have been}} Rose's plan all along to save her father; this is left {{ambiguous}} in the episode. Billie Piper felt that it did not occur to Rose until after she began travelling. In the original script, in the scene where the Doctor opens the TARDIS doors and discovers only a police box interior, the police box fell apart. This was changed for reasons of cost, and Cornell has stated that he thinks the change is an improvement. Cornell also states that the character of Pete Tyler is based on his own father, who attempted many different jobs and schemes (including, like Pete, selling health drinks) before eventually finding success running a betting shop. Pete's line [...] "I'm your dad, it's my job for it to be my fault" [...] is taken from something Cornell's father once said to him. Originally Pete was to take a <b>swig</b> <b>of</b> wine before sacrificing himself, but this was removed because a correlation between alcohol and bravery was not thought to be a positive message.|$|E
500|$|She later {{appeared}} in two films directed by Robert Altman, Cookie's Fortune (1999) and Dr. T & the Women (2000). In Cookie's Fortune, {{she was part}} of an ensemble cast that included Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Chris O'Donnell, and Patricia Neal. Her performance was well received among critics; Salon.com wrote: [...] "This {{is the first time in}} which Tyler's acting is a match for her beauty (she's always been a bit forlorn). Altman helps her find some snap, but a relaxed, silly snap, as in the cartoon sound she makes when she takes a midday <b>swig</b> <b>of</b> bourbon. The lazy geniality of the movie is summed up by the way Emma [...] saunters off to take a swim with her cowboy hat and pint of Wild Turkey." [...] Entertainment Weekly also noted that Tyler is [...] "sweetly gruff as the tomboy troublemaker". In the romantic comedy, Dr. T & the Women, she played Marilyn, a gynecological patient of Richard Gere's character and the lesbian lover of his daughter, played by Kate Hudson.|$|E
2500|$|In this legend, {{which dates}} back to 1970, a police (or customs) officer pulls over a driver {{believed}} to have been drinking, sees that the driver has a water bottle, and demands a taste of it to see if it contains alcohol. [...] The officer does not taste any alcohol, so the driver either gets off completely or merely gets a speeding ticket. Shortly afterward, the officer begins tripping very hard and stares into space, since the <b>swig</b> <b>of</b> [...] "water" [...] he took actually contained numerous [...] "hits" [...] of LSD. [...] In some versions of the legend, the officer consumes enough LSD to actually go insane. [...] According to Snopes.com, there are no verifiable reports of this ever happening, even decades after the legend was first told, and it is thus considered spurious. However, there have been recent accounts of officers dosed while on the job.|$|E

He said these were tedious people to talk with. He said that men who had been cured by the other process were easily distinguished from the rest of mankind because they always tilted their heads back, between every two words, and swallowed a <b>swig</b> <b>of</b> imaginary whey.

I thought maybe Miss Sterling was just learning to keep house and cook--that rabbit would surely make you think so--and I says to myself, 'Little lady, sugar or no sugar I'll stand by you,' and I raises up my bowl again and drinks the last drop of the lemonade. And then all the balance of 'em picks up their bowls and does the same.

Jacob is a down-to-earth and rather commonplace sort of person, whose social pride does not conflict with his easy-going attitude to morality. Shankaran, on the other hand, is a mild-mannered loner. He has an easy, friendly relationship with the workers. Muniyandi (Sreenivasan), a worker in the farm, is a timid god-fearing man. His job is to look after the cattle. One day he confesses to Shankaran {{that he is going to}} his village to get married. When he asks Jacob for leave, Jacob brusquely tells him that he must be back immediately after the wedding.
