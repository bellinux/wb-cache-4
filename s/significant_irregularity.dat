40|$|Cutaneous melanocytic lesions, {{commonly}} known as moles, are mostly benign; however, {{some of them are}} malignant melanomas, the most fatal form of skin cancer. Because the survival rate of melanoma is inversely proportional to the thickness of the tumor, early detection is vital to the treatment process. Many dermatologists have advocated the development of computer-aided diagnosis systems for early detection of melanoma. One of the important clinical features differentiating benign nevi from malignant melanomas is the lesion border irregularity. There are two types of border irregularity: texture and structure irregularities. Texture irregularities are the small variations along the border, while structure irregularities are the global indentations and protrusions that may suggest either the unstable growth in a lesion or regression of a melanoma. An accurate measurement of structure irregularities is essential to detect the malignancy of melanoma. This thesis extends the classic curvature scale-space filtering technique to locate all structure irregular segments along a melanocytic lesion border. An area-based index, called irregularity index, is then computed for each segment. From the individual irregularity index, two important new measures, the most <b>significant</b> <b>irregularity</b> index and the overall irregularity index, are derived. These two indices describe the degree of irregularity along the lesion border. A double-blind user study is performed to compare the new measures with twenty experienced dermatologists' evaluations. Forty melanocytic lesion images were selected and their borders were extracted automatically after dark thick hairs were removed by a preprocessor called DullRazor. The overall irregularity index and the most <b>significant</b> <b>irregularity</b> index we [...] ...|$|E

40|$|As {{high-end}} {{computer systems}} present users with rapidly {{increasing numbers of}} processors, possibly also incorporating attached co-processors, programmers are increasingly challenged to express the necessary levels of concurrency with the dominant parallel programming model, Fortran+MPI+OpenMP (or minor variations). In this paper, we examine the languages developed under the DARPA High-Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) program (Chapel, Fortress, and X 10) as representatives of a different parallel programming model which might be more effective on coming high-performance systems. The application {{used in this study}} is the Hartree-Fock method from quantum chemistry, which combines access to distributed data with a task-parallel algorithm and is characterized by <b>significant</b> <b>irregularity</b> in the computational tasks. We present several different implementation strategies for load balancing of the task parallel computation, as well as distributed array operations, {{in each of the three}} languages.

MethodsWe examined 14 controls and 15 epilepsy patients receiving chronic valproate monotherapy, who had no subjective complaints related to motor function. Regularity and maximum frequency of repetitive hand and finger movements, and simple reaction time were measured. Intensity and frequency characteristics of resting and postural tremor were assessed using accelerometry. Data were statistically evaluated. ResultsRepetitive hand and finger movements were significantly more irregular and the maximum frequency of repetitive movements was significantly lower in the valproate group than in controls. Resting tremor peak frequency and motor reaction time of the two cohorts did not differ. ConclusionsThis is the first study, which quantitatively assesses motor performance of patients with epilepsy on chronic valproate therapy. The results suggest <b>significant</b> <b>irregularity</b> of repetitive hand movements and finger tapping even in patients with no motor complaints. Objective methods might help to recognize valproate-induced motor performance deterioration...|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in {{wireless sensor networks}} is lo-calization – {{the determination of the}} geographical locations of sensors. Most existing localization algorithms were de-signed to work well either in networks of static sensors or networks in which all sensors are mobile. In this paper, we propose two localization algorithms, MSL and MSL*, that work well when any number of sensors are static or mobile. MSL and MSL * are range-free algorithms – they do not require that sensors are equipped with hardware to mea-sure signal strengths, angles of arrival of signals or distances to other sensors. We present simulation results to demon-strate that MSL and MSL * outperform existing algorithms in terms of localization error in very different mobility condi-tions. MSL * outperforms MSL in most scenarios, but incurs a higher communication cost. MSL outperforms MSL * when there is <b>significant</b> <b>irregularity</b> in the radio range. We also point out some problems with a well known lower bound for the error in any range-free localization algorithm in static sensor networks...|$|E
40|$|Chromosomes are {{compartmentalized}} into discrete chromosome territories during interphase in mammalian cells. A chromosome {{territory is}} generated by the tendency of chromatin to occupy the smallest shell volume, which {{is determined by the}} polymeric properties and interactions of the internal meshwork of the chromatin fiber. Here, we show that BAF 53 knockdown by small interfering RNA interference led to the expansion of chromosome territories. This was accompanied by a reduction in chromatin compaction, an increase in the micrococcal nuclease sensitivity of the chromatin, and an alteration in H 3 -K 9 and H 3 -K 79 dimethylation. Interestingly, the BAF 53 knockdown cells suffer a cell cycle defect. Despite the <b>significant</b> <b>irregularity</b> and decompaction of the polynucleosomes isolated from the BAF 53 knockdown cells, the chromatin loading of H 1 and core histones remained unaltered, as did the nucleosome spacing. The histone hyperacetylation and down-regulation of BRG- 1, mBrm, and Tip 49, the catalytic components of the SWI/SNF complex and the TIP 60 complex, respectively, did not expand chromosome territories. These results indicate that BAF 53 contributes to the polymeric properties and/or the internal meshwork interactions of the chromatin fiber probably via a novel mechanism...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} by Dr. John 1 {{demonstrates}} the care {{that one must}} take in programming an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, the complexity of these patients and {{the utility of the}} internal diagnostics in the system to facilitate the physician's understanding of device behavior. Even the single chamber ICDs have SVT discrimination algorithms that can be enabled in an effort to differentiate SVT from VT allowing the device to withhold ATP and shock therapy in the setting of an SVT. Many physicians, myself included, will initially utilize these discriminators in a monitoring mode preferring to deliver unnecessary therapy rather than inappropriately withholding needed therapy. This also provides an opportunity to better understand all the rhythms that may be occurring in a patient, many of which may not have been appreciated prior to the implant. After one or more SVT episodes have occurred and the clinician has a chance to review the stored electrograms (first introduced by Ventritex) along with the response of the device to any discriminators, a decision can be made as to how the ICD prescription might be adjusted. My examination of the stored electrogram documenting the initial atrial fibrillation episode suggests <b>significant</b> <b>irregularity</b> of the ventricular response.

My work focuses on theoretical tools for summarizing, analyzing, and understanding network data sets, or data sets of things and their pairwise connections. I address four network science issues, improving our ability to analyze networks {{from a variety of}} domains. I first show that the sophistication of game-theoretic agent decision making can crucially effect network cascades: differing decision making assumptions can lead to dramatically different cascade outcomes. This highlights the importance of diligence when making assumptions about agent behavior on networks and in general. I next analytically demonstrate a <b>significant</b> <b>irregularity</b> in the popular eigenvector centrality, and propose a new spectral centrality measure, nonbacktracking centrality, showing that it avoids this irregularity. This tool contributes a more robust way of ranking nodes, as well as an additional mathematical understanding of the effects of network localization. I next give a new model for uncertain networks, networks in which one has no access to true network data but instead observes only probabilistic information about edge existence. I give a fast maximum-likelihood algorithm for recovering edges and communities in this model, and show that it outperforms a typical approach of thresholding to an unweighted network. This model gives a better tool for understanding and analyzing real-world uncertain networks such as those arising in the experimental sciences. Lastly, I give a new lens for understanding scientific literature, specifically as a hybrid coauthorship and citation network. I use this for exploratory analysis of the Physical Review journals over a hundred-year period, and I make new observations about the interplay between these two networks and how this relationship has changed over time...|$|E
40|$|We present our timesaving joint RANS/LES {{approach}} (we {{originally developed}} it for numerical simulations of turbulent premixed combustion) to simulate flameless combustion with separate injection of gas fuel and strong exhaust gas recirculation. It {{is based on}} successive RANS/LES numerical modeling where part of the information (stationary average fields) is achieved by RANS simulations and part (instantaneous nonstationary image of the process) by LES. The latter is performed using the RANS field of mean dissipation rate to model the sub-grid turbulent viscosity {{in the context of}} the Kolmogorov theory of small-scale turbulence. We analyze flameless combustion in the FLOX® combustor where we also simulate non-premixed flame combustion used for preliminary heating of the combustor. Different regimes take place using different systems of air injection. We applied for both regimes the simple assumption of “mixed is burnt”. The main results are the following: 1) RANS simulations demonstrate for used two injection systems respectively more compact flame and distributed flameless combustion. 2) There is agreement between RANS and corresponding LES results: RANS and averaged LES profiles of the velocity and temperature are in reasonable agreement. 3) LES modeling with Kolmogorov independent on time sub-grid viscosity reproduce instantaneous image of the process including the vortex structures. Probably due to using an annular injector system for air the instantaneous field of the temperature demonstrate <b>significant</b> <b>irregularity</b> in the beginning of the burner, which in an animation looks like moving coherent structures. 4) In the joint RANS/LES approach the computer time of the LES sub-problems is much shorter than classic LES modeling due to using time independent subgrid transport coefficients and avoiding long-continued simulations, which are necessary for averaging of instantaneous LES fields. Practically in our simulations time consuming of the LES sub-problem was only several times lager then the RANS one and it makes this approach suitable for industrial applications...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} regarded {{that the bulk}} of cosmic rays originate in the Galaxy and that those below the ’knee ’ (the rapid steepening in the energy spectrum) at a few PeV come from Galactic supernovae, the particles being accelerated by the shocks in the supernova remnants. At higher energies, there are problems in that conventional SNR- which surely constitute the bulk of the sources- have a natural limit at a few tens of PeV (for iron nuclei). The question of the origin of particles above this limit is thus an open one. Here we examine a number of possibilities: a variety of supernovae and hypernovae, pulsars, a Giant Galactic Halo and an Extragalactic origin. A relevant property of any model {{is the extent to which}} it can provide the lack of <b>significant</b> <b>irregularity</b> of the energy spectrum, its intensity and shape together with structures such as the ’second knee ’ at the sub-EeV energy, in addition to the well known ’knee ’ and ’ankle’. Although it is appreciated that spectral measurements are subject to systematic as well as random errors we consider that contemporary data are good enough to allow at least some progress in this new field. These aspects are examined for particles of all energies and it is shown that they can constrain some parameters of the proposed models. In the search for origin above PeV energies we conclude that shocks in the Galactic Halo, whatever their source (Galactic wind, relativistic plasmoids- ’cannonballs’, multiple shocks from supernovae etc.) are most likely, pulsars such as B 0656 + 14 and hypernovae come a close second although such a suggestion is not without its difficulties. What is most important is that trapping of particles in the Halo is needed to reduce irregularities of the energy spectra both below and above the ’knee ’ caused by the stochastic nature of supernova explosions and other potential (discrete) Galactic sources. We argue that precise experimental studies of spectral ‘irregularities ‘ will provide considerable help in the search for cosmic ray origin. ...|$|E
