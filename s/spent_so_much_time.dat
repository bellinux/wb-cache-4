25|$|The {{collapse}} of the army that Reza Shah had <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> and effort creating was humiliating. Many of the military generals had behaved incompetently or secretly sympathised with the British and ended up sabotaging the Iranian resistance. The army generals met in secret to discuss surrender options. When the Shah learned of the generals' actions, he beat {{the head of the}} armed forces General Ahmad Nakhjavan with a cane and physically stripped him of his rank. He was nearly shot by the Shah on the spot, but at the insistence of the Crown Prince, he was sent to prison instead.|$|E
25|$|The first {{scheduled}} service with a Class 72 train occurred on 8 August 2002 on the Jæren Commuter Rail. NSB {{stated that they}} had never previously <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> testing equipment before putting it into service, and that the Jæren had been chosen for the introduction because the single-line system was easier to operate than the services around Oslo. The company also stated that they hoped all the trains would be in service by the end of 2003. By January 2003, half the trains had been delivered, and were gradually being put into service on the Oslo Commuter Rail. However, on the Gardermoen Line the electronics from the train were interfering with the signaling systems, so the lights would switch from green to red before the train passed, instead of afterwards. This made it impossible for the NSB to put the train into service on Norway's only high-speed line. Another problem was that the trains would not close the doors if they were at a station without level tracks, although this was quickly solved. In 2003, NSB decided to abandon the Puls concept, and revert to the former single-profile strategy.|$|E

25|$|Tailchaser's Song begins, after quoting {{a poem by}} Christopher Smart, with an {{exposition}} of the central elements of the cats' mythology, starting with a creation myth. This both frames the further developments of cat mythology and culture throughout the story and provides necessary backstory for the novel itself. Meerclar Allmother is identified as the primordial creator of all other beings, who brought forth a pair of cats who are the progenitors of the entire species as well as divine figures. Harar Goldeneye is the male, and Fela Skydancer the female. The first litter of this pair are also divine. These three cats are called the Firstborn; the middle child, Grizraz Hearteater, raises a monstrous hound out of jealousy and sets it to attack all cats. The eldest of the three, Viror Whitewind, slays the creature but is himself mortally wounded. Hearteater is driven out and flees beneath the ground where he searches out arcane lore, while Whitewind's death causes his father to flee to the heavens after searching for Hearteater in a murderous rage and causes his mother to be silent {{for the rest of}} his life. His youngest brother, Tangaloor Firefoot, renounced his claim to the throne and fled from the court out of grief. As a result of a further encounter with Firefoot, Hearteater is blinded by sun after having <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> beneath the earth, and retreats back beneath the ground, where it is supposed that he plots further destruction.|$|E

[...] Nelson's impressions were similar: [...] "It was the absolute misogyny of his crimes that stunned me," [...] she wrote, [...] "his manifest rage against women. He had no compassion at all ... he was totally engrossed in the details. His murders were his life's accomplishments." ...|$|E

I worked on the revision of my father 2 ̆ 7 s book about regional history which was published several years ago and might go into a second printing. I developed pedagogical materials for a Jan Term 2016 travel course, CHEM/MLGR 398 : The Art, Science, and Culture of Brewing, which I co-teach in Germany, the Czech Republic, and Belgium. My MLGR 240 course on German film needed updating as well, and, since I <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> unexpected <b>time</b> in Germany, got more attention than I had originally anticipated.

And I <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> {{building}} that trophy case." [...] The scene then cuts to the trophy case with an Academy Award in it that Homer has stolen. In the original Fox broadcast, the name in the inscription on the Academy Award was Haing S. Ngor. In American syndication and the season seven DVD, the name was changed to Don Ameche (who had won for Cocoon). Ngor, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the 1984 film The Killing Fields, was murdered on February 25, 1996, between the original and the syndicated broadcast. Producers were concerned the syndicated episode would imply Homer had murdered Ngor to steal the statue.|$|E

Several works had been left incomplete, and publishers inquired about releasing a final edition of his grand collection La Comédie humaine. Hańska sponsored new editions of his works and was involved in editing some of them, even adding occasional content. Balzac's debt, meanwhile, still exceeded 200,000 francs, which Hańska paid while also providing for his mother's living expenses. One of her letters at the time gives voice to her frustrations: [...] "In nursing my husband's incurable malady I ruined my health, just as I have ruined my private fortune in accepting the inheritance of debts and embarrassments which he left me." [...] Anna and Jerzy moved into a nearby house in Paris.|$|E

He had been first drawn to this work in 1883, after listening to a sermon in St Mary's Church, Oxford, by Samuel Augustus Barnett, Vicar of St Jude's, Whitechapel. Barnett became the settlement's first leader, while Lang became one of its first undergraduate secretaries. He <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> on these duties that he was chided by the Master of Balliol, Benjamin Jowett, for neglecting his studies.

Youngsters found the hay loft to be a perfect place to “sleepover” and the young Michelsen boys carried on endless “Cops and Robbers” shoot outs with their friends.

This latter activity {{was a source of}} great concern to one neighbour who predicted a dark future for young boys who <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of their <b>time</b> in such “unlawful play”.

After his emigration and successful settlement in Australia, Zofrea studied at the Julian Ashton School in Sydney, and later privately with Henry V. Justelius. Naturally, having <b>spent</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of his <b>time</b> in Italy at church, he first discovered his talents for art when he would attempt to replicate some of the church's statues using clay he found in nearby fields.

When, in course of time, {{a number of small}} Brands came to howl and tumble about the cottage, they naturally gravitated towards the scullery, which then virtually became the nursery, with a stout old seaman, of the name of Ogilvy, usually acting the part of head nurse. His duties were onerous, by reason of the strength of constitution, lungs, and muscles of the young Brands, whose ungovernable desire to play with that dangerous element from which heat is evolved, undoubtedly qualified them for the honorary title of Fire-Brands.|$|R

Haynes was also interested in nature and spent considerable time in the forest cataloging and observing plants, insects, and animals.

[...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time.

[...] By killing off the Asgard race, Cooper gave the episode an element of tragedy that reflected his feelings at the time.

Because of fan vocality about team episodes, Cooper decided to put the characters through several decades of life and see their relationships develop and evolve. The references in [...] "Unending" [...] to the events of season 2's [...] "The Fifth Race", another Cooper-penned episode often named as a fan favorite, were intended, as were the callbacks to season 9's [...] "The Ties That Bind" [...] (the Daniel-Vala argument, see below) and season 10's [...] "Line In The Sand" [...] (the solution of using the Ori beam). The period aboard the ship was originally significantly less than fifty years, but the actors' last-stage makeup, which Cooper only saw minutes before filming, looked so old that Cooper was forced {{to increase the number of}} years in the script.|$|E

Suddenly, she finds herself and Reki trapped inside of Reki's dream, Reki standing on the tracks and the train approaching. Rakka rushes to help - only to learn that Reki cannot be saved without asking for help. On the brink of being run over again, this time by a grey amorphous train-like shape emerging from the wall painting, Reki does ask for help; Rakka rescues Reki just before the shape passes.
