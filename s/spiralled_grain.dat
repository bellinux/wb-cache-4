For research purposes the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> in stems and logs is normally measured by destructive methods. In this study the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> of the stems was measured nondestructively with a computed tomography (CT) scanner. Twelve Norway spruce (Picea abies) stems from two stands in Sweden were scanned with a CT scanner with one cross-sectional scan every 10 mm along the stem. Concentric surfaces at various distances from the pith were reconstructed from the stack of CT images. In these concentric-surface images, which show various internal features of the log. the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angle was measured at different distances from the pith and at different heights in the stem. The destructive measurements of the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> were carried out on disks from the top ends of the logs.

30|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>grain</b> is {{a regular}} feature of many tree species, and {{remains one of the}} most {{important}} factors influencing wood utilisation (Denzler et al. 2015). However, the factors controlling its formation are poorly understood (Harris 1989; Kubler 1991; Skatter and Kučera 1997). <b>Spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angle (SGA) is defined as the orientation of wood fibres or tracheids with respect to the longitudinal axis of the tree stem (Kozlowski et al. 1967). Changes in the grain angle within stems are a well-known feature of old trees and of the corewood of conifers, and are normally attributed to pseudotransverse and anticlinal cell division in the vascular cambium (Bannan 1966; Larson 1994; Schulgasser and Witztum 2007). <b>Spiral</b> <b>grain</b> is an important defect is sawn timber and is a primary source of twist distortion during drying (Ormarsson and Cown 2005).|$|R

Highest heritability estimates of mean grain angle occurred at ring 4 and then declined with age, ranging from 0.45 down to 0.20.

30|$|Distortions due to {{moisture}} {{changes during}} drying or in service {{are a major}} problem for construction timber. Twist, caused mainly by the cylindrical geometry, the orthotropic nature of the wood material, and the tendency of the wood fibers to grow in a spiral around the stem, is often regarded as the most detrimental distortion of sawn timber. There is a need for a basic mechanical understanding of how the twist distortion arises and also a need for a simple formula to predict the amount of twist distortion. In this article such a formula is proposed, and theory and experimental data that indicate the validity of the formula are shown. The first term in the formula is a modification of a traditional expression which is proportional to the mean value of the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angle in the cross section in question. The second term in the formula is new and is proportional to the gradient of the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angle, and this term normally counteracts the first term so that a stud with a left-handed <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> might achieve a right-handed twist. Linear elastic finite element method (FEM) results and comparisons with experimental data show that the formula works well and that linear FEM calculations exaggerate the twist, which is probably partly due to nonlinear effects. The formula could be used to predict the twist of sawn timber from measured <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angles on the log surface.|$|R

30|$|One of {{the factors}} that has the {{greatest}} influence on the utilisation of wood {{from a wide range of}} species, including radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don), is lack of dimensional stability caused by <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> (Johansson et al. 1994). <b>Spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angle (SGA) is defined as the orientation of fibres (tracheids) with reference to the longitudinal axis of the tree stem. The relatively high values of SGA found in radiata pine (Ormarsson and Cown 2005), particularly in corewood, can cause twist in dry timber, distortion in plywood sheets, surfacing problems during machining (Tsehaye and Walker 1995; Ekevad 2005) and are a major cause of drying degrade in radiata pine and other conifers (Haslett and McConchie 1986; Haslett et al. 1991; Danborg 1994). Cown et al. (1995) reported that twist in radiata pine is responsible for at least 90 % of the instability of affected radiata pine timber produced in fast-grown plantations in New Zealand. Similarly, Sorensson and Lausberg (1996) demonstrated that a decrease in <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> in juvenile wood of 3 degrees was sufficient to reduce rejection rates for twist from 12 % to 5 %, and would save the New Zealand forest industry about $ 58 million per annum.|$|R

40|$|Wood {{is a major}} {{construction}} material that is used in many contexts, and for different purposes. Serious problems may arise, however, when moisture related deformations as twist occur in wood used in different types of building structures, joinery and furniture. Twist can be explained to a great degree by the helical deviation of the grain angle {{in relation to the}} longitudinal direction of the log or the sawn board. Wood fibres form a spiral within the tree, and this is a natural occurrence that is named <b>spiral</b> <b>grain.</b> The wood fibres close to the pith in Norway spruce form a left-handed spiral. In most trees the grain angle turns over to be right-handed with time. Sawn timber that exhibits large grain angles lead to problems of shape stability and stiffness in finished constructions. In this thesis the <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) was stated as well as the effect on sawn timber. The material was based on sample trees from Sweden and Finland. Samples were taken in twenty-two stands at different heights in tree. From six stands studs were sawn and dried for measuring twist and other deformations. The <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> was measured with the method scribe test on 390 log discs taken at the top-end of the logs. Account was given concerning changes in grain angle from pith to bark, regarding both increasing annual ring numbers and distance from pith. The development of grain angle over tree age was utilized to study whether annual growth, size of tree, height in tree as well as silvicultural treatments affected <b>spiral</b> <b>grain.</b> Moreover, the relation between grain angle and distance to pith (in mm) was used to forecast twist in sawn timber. The left-handed grain angle was at its greatest between the fourth and eighth annual rings. Thereafter for most trees the grain angle turned from left-handed to right-handed in a linear fashion, in a manner that was unique for each individual tree. The pattern of <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> differed significantly between different stands, regarding change of inclination with increasing age or distance from pith. The culmination of the grain angle close to the pith occurred at somewhat higher age higher up in the trunk. The grain angle decreased faster in top logs than it did in the butt logs. The largest trees within a stand had a grain angle that turned to right in a slower way than smaller ones. The thinning strength and type of thinning regime also affected the character of <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> in the remaining trees in a stand. There was an indication that strong thinnings, where fast growing trees are retained, may lead to more individuals in a stand that exhibit high grain angles under bark. With knowledge of the size and direction of the grain angle under bark, and the diameter of the log, calculations can be made that show how twisted the sawn timber will be after drying. This can be used for deciding whether an individual log can profitably be sawn and processed further or not. The grain angle under bark can be used to remove trees showing the greatest degree of <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> already in the first thinning. Silvicultural methods aiming at even and dense Norway spruce stands, which normally is practised in Scandinavia, will probably result in timber with relatively low risk concerning large grain angle and subsequent risk for twist in sawn wood...|$|R

The main objective of this work was to identify the cause of moisture-induced distortion and create statistical and analytical models to predict distortion on the basis of material parameters. The work also gives recommendations on the parameters that should be focused on in order to develop methods to remove material prone to distortion. Studies were conducted in which the distortion in a large number of studs was measured at several moisture content levels. The changes in moisture content were made without outer restraints in order to study the effect of the material without the effect of restraints. Several material parameters were also measured on the studs; <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angle, annual ring curvature, juvenile wood, knots, annual ring width, compression wood, cracks, wane, density, shrinkage and skew sawing. <b>Spiral</b> <b>grain</b> angle and annual ring curvature together explain about 65 % of the variation in twist.

Karst.) clones differing in growth characteristics were tested for maximum specific hydraulic conductivity (ks 100), vulnerability to cavitation and behavior under mechanical stress. The {{vulnerability of the}} clones to cav-itation was assessed by measuring the applied air pressure re-quired to cause 12 and 50 % loss of conductivity (Ψ 12, Ψ 50) and the percent loss of conductivity at 4 MPa applied air pressure (PLC 4 MPa). The bending strength and stiffness and the axial compression strength and stiffness of the same stem segments were measured to characterize wood mechanical properties. Growth ring width, wood density, latewood percentage, lumen diameter, cell wall thickness, tracheid length and pit dimen-sions of earlywood cells, <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> and microfibril angles were examined to identify structure–function relationships. High ks 100 was strongly and positively related to <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> an-gle, which corresponded positively to tracheid length and pit dimensions. <b>Spiral</b> <b>grain</b> may reduce flow resistance of the bor-dered pits of the first earlywood tracheids, which are character-ized by rounded tips and an equal distribution of pits along the entire length. Wood density was unrelated to hydraulic vulner-ability parameters. Traits associated with higher hydraulic vul-nerability were long tracheids, high latewood percentage and thick earlywood cell walls. The positive relationship between earlywood cell wall thickness and vulnerability to cavitation suggest that air seeding through the margo of bordered pits may occur in earlywood. There was a positive phenotypic and genotypic relationship between ks 100 and PLC 4 MPa, and both pa-rameters were positively related to tree growth rate. Variability in mechanical properties depended mostly on wood density, {{but also on the}} amount of compression wood. Accordingly, hy-draulic conductivity and mechanical strength or stiffness showed no tradeoff...|$|R
40|$|Radiata pine (Pinus radiata) is {{the most}} {{important}} plantation tree in New Zealand forestry, and factors that reduce the quality of wood cause significant economic loss. Two of {{the most important of these}} issues are compression wood and <b>spiral</b> <b>grain.</b> Compression wood is a type of reaction wood, formed when a tree moves away from the vertical, and is characterised by biochemical and structural changes within the wood that reduce its quality and value. <b>Spiral</b> <b>grain,</b> however, is the alignment of the wood grain in a helix around the tree’s axis and away from the vertical. Again, this reduces the structural qualities of the wood and thus its value. <b>Spiral</b> <b>grain</b> and compression wood are notorious for their deleterious effect on the quality of wood produced and are very important for the forest industry due to the huge economic loss they cause. The demand for reliable tools to evaluate these wood quality issues in clonal planting material at an early stage, within 3 years of germination rather than at 8 to 15 years as in current practise, is of ever increasing importance from plant breeders and other industry stake holders. Therefore this research was undertaken with an overall aim to develop quick, easy and reproducible techniques to evaluate young radiata pine clones (up to 3 years old) based on compression wood content and presence of <b>spiral</b> <b>grain.</b> This is important because a shortened breeding cycle could provide significant economic benefits to the forest industry. The incidence of these commercially important wood quality parameters has been studied in this thesis in research conducted on young trees (1 to 3 years old). The research described in this thesis used a variety of different imaging approaches to investigate wood structure, including polarised light and confocal microscopy, and X-ray tomography and circular polarised light scanning. The images achieved have been analysed using a range of different software, including Photoshop, ImageJ and Matlab bringing a quantification approach to the imaging. Compression wood was quantified in young clonal material using images collected with a commercial document scanner, and processed using image analysis tools available in Photoshop. An easy, reliable and robust, automatic image analysis protocol was successfully developed and tested for the detection and quantification of compression wood in these young trees. This new technique to detect and quantify compression wood was based on the thresholding of the blue channel of the scanned RGB image as this was demonstrated to contain the greatest image contrast. Development of this new technique may reduce the waiting time for screening clonal planting materials based on compression wood content. To understand the organisation of the grain at a cellular level within these young trees, confocal microscopy techniques were utilised. The cell wall characteristics and fluorescence properties of compression wood in comparison with normal wood were investigated using a new cellulose specific dye, pontamine fast scarlet 4 B. Staining protocols for this dye for confocal microscopy were optimised, and the potential of measuring the microfibril angle of the S 1 and S 3 layers of the pontamine treated opposite wood was demonstrated through either direct observations of these layers, or through the property of bifluorescence where the dye is excited only when aligned parallel to the polarisation of the incident light. Despite extensive work with confocal microscopy, this technique proved to be unsuitable for investigations of <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> because although it provided cellular detail, imaging was limited to the surface layers of sections, and the area over which observations were required was prohibitive. Instead of confocal microscopy, the incidence of <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> in young stems was investigated in two completely new ways. Resin canals, which are formed from the same cambial initials as the tracheids and which align with the grain, were used as a proxy to demonstrate the grain changes. A novel technique, using circular polarised light and a professional flatbed scanner, was developed to image whole serial transverse sections of the young stems to detect the resin canals. Using ImageJ, the number and location of resin canals was measured on vertical controls, and trees that had been rocked and leaned. The number and frequency of resin canals were less in tilted trees, especially in compression wood, compared to the higher number of canals formed in the rocked trees. More importantly, a combination of serial sectioning and this approach allowed a 3 -dimensional view of the orientation of resin canals inside a stem to be generated with ImageJ, and the angles of these canals could be measured using Matlab. The resin canals were oriented with a left-handed spiralling near the stem surface whereas the canals near to the pith were nearly straight, consistent with previous observations of the development of <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> in radiata pine. However, it was observed that while vertical trees had a symmetric pattern of grain and grain changes around the stem, this was not the case in tilted trees. In these, the opposite wood often had severe <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> visible through formation of twist whereas the compression wood formed on the lower side had bending. Consistent with this, grain associated with compression wood was significantly straighter than in opposite wood. This hitherto unknown link between the incidence of compression wood and <b>spiral</b> <b>grain</b> was investigated and explained on the basis of the characteristics of resin canals in these types of wood. X-ray micro-tomography was also used to investigate resin canals in the stubs from which serial sections were collected. The 3 D reconstructions of the resin canals showed exactly the same patterns as observed by polarised light scanning...|$|R
