5|$|These {{include two}} images {{that show the}} subject standing. One captures a full length view, in which the subject is unclothed except {{for a pair of}} {{stockings}} and <b>shoes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> other, the subject's right leg is raised to provide a clearer view of the genitalia. Another image presents the subject lying back with one arm covering the face while someone else's hand pulls on the penile tissue. A similar photograph shows the subject in an examination position, with a hand– visible in the uncut photographic plate as belonging to Maisonneuve– spreading the vaginal lips. The series also includes a close-up of the subject's genitalia, with the legs open.|$|E
5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden {{by the woman}} on her pattens to avoid putting her good <b>shoes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> snow and filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or {{a pair of scissors}} {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1893 Potter {{illustrated}} {{and made a}} booklet of [...] "There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe". There, the Old Woman's children are depicted as scampering mice, and their mother as a mouse whipping her children <b>in</b> a <b>shoe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background. <b>In</b> Appley Dapply however, the author speculates upon the identity of <b>the</b> old woman <b>in</b> two stanzas, believing she was a mouse due {{to being able to}} live <b>in</b> a <b>shoe.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first illustration, the mouse and her children tumble from an elaborately beaded turquoise-blue <b>shoe,</b> and, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> illustration accompanying the second stanza, the mouse knits peacefully [...] presumably while <b>the</b> children are <b>in</b> bed.|$|R

25|$|A common casual <b>shoe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pyrenees {{during the}} Middle Ages were espadrilles. These are sandals with braided jute soles and a fabric upper portion, and often {{includes}} fabric laces that tie around the ankle. The term is French and {{comes from the}} esparto grass. <b>The</b> <b>shoes</b> originate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Catalonian region of Spain {{as early as the}} 13th century, and were commonly worn by peasants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> farming communities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|R
5|$|Another one of Bowerman's pupils, Phil Knight, {{partnered with}} Bowerman and {{revolutionized}} the sport with {{the formation of}} the shoe company giant, Nike. Knight graduated from the University of Oregon in 1959 and went on to Stanford University for graduate school. There, he developed the idea to import Japanese running shoes to the American market. After earning his MBA from Stanford, he returned to the University of Oregon where he and Bowerman struck a handshake deal in 1964, each with a $500 investment into a company called Blue Ribbon Sports to import Japanese running <b>shoes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 1960s, Bowerman's pursuit of lighter shoes for his athletes led him to develop a sole by pouring rubber into his wife's waffle iron, inventing the modern running shoe. After Knight decided to rename the company Nike and develop its own shoes, Bowerman's invention became the prototype for the company. The shoe made its debut in the 1972 Olympic Trials at Hayward Field with Steve Prefontaine as one of the early endorsers. Although Bowerman retired from coaching in 1972, he remained on Nike's board until 1999. In that time, Nike exploded into a multibillion-dollar company.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{continuing}} to use the side-scrolling perspective introduced to the series by , A Link to the Past reverts to an overhead perspective {{similar to that of}} the original. While A Link to the Past still uses mechanics and concepts from the original game, it also introduces new elements and innovations. For instance, arrows are now separate items, as bombs are in the original, instead of using a Rupee to fire an arrow. A Link to the Past also takes concepts from The Adventure of Link, such as the magic meter, which is used by items such as the Lamp. Control of Link is more flexible than in previous games, as he can walk diagonally and can run with the aid of the Pegasus Boots (Pegasus <b>Shoes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> GBA version),although he cannot use the Pegasus boots diagonally. Link's sword attack was improved to swing sideways instead of merely stabbing forward; this gives his sword a broader range and makes combat easier. Link swings his sword as the default attack in future Zelda games, although stabbing is also possible in the later 3D incarnations.|$|E
25|$|Rayne (also {{known as}} H. & M. Rayne) is a British {{manufacturer}} known for high-end and couture shoes. Founded in 1899 as a theatrical costumier, it diversified into fashion <b>shoes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s.|$|E

25|$|Mosques, in {{accordance}} with Islamic practices, institute a number of rules intended to keep Muslims focused on worshiping God.

25|$|The textile {{industry}} prospered during the 1970s. The city {{was the largest}} supplier of denim. Most of its manufacturers utilised shuttleless weaving machines {{and there were a}} total of 29,577 weaving machines. Shoe-makers started to produce leather shoes rather than the cheap <b>shoes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s. Major clothing companies also emerged and quartz watches were first made during this period.|$|E
25|$|Shoes {{also play}} an {{important}} role in the fairy tales Cinderella and The Red <b>Shoes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> movie adaption of the children's book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, a pair of red ruby slippers play a key role in the plot.

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, the {{popularity}} of the sneakers was on the decline, executives departed the company and KangaROOS were quietly withdrawn from the market.

25|$|The {{original}} {{versions of}} Innovia Metro {{were based on}} a linear induction motor (LIM) using vehicle-mounted windings and a track-mounted stator consisting of a thin aluminum plate mounted flat between the tracks. The small size and flat shape of the motor, and its lack of a transmission connected to the bogies, allows the ART to be much closer to the ground than a traditional subway car. The motor is used for all control with the exception of emergency braking using conventional <b>shoes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bogies.|$|E
25|$|In Zemun, the crusaders became suspicious, seeing Walter's sixteen suits {{of armor}} {{hanging from the}} walls, and {{eventually}} a dispute over {{the price of a}} pair of <b>shoes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market led to a riot, which then turned into an all-out assault on the city by the crusaders, in which 4,000 Hungarians were killed. The crusaders then fled across the river Sava to Belgrade, but only after skirmishing with Belgrade troops. The residents of Belgrade fled, and the crusaders pillaged and burned the city. Then they marched for seven days, arriving at Niš on 3 July. There, the commander of Niš promised to provide escort for Peter's army to Constantinople as well as food, if he would leave right away. Peter obliged, and the next morning he set out. However, a few Germans got into a dispute with some locals along the road and set fire to a mill, which escalated out of Peter's control until Niš sent out its entire garrison against the crusaders. The crusaders were completely routed, losing about 10,000 (a quarter of their number), the remainder regrouping further on at Bela Palanka. When they reached Sofia on 12 July they met their Byzantine escort, which brought them safely {{the rest of the way}} to Constantinople by 1 August.|$|E

500|$|The {{custom of}} concealing <b>shoes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fabric of a {{building}} appears to have more or less died out some time during the 20th century, although not entirely. The shoe manufacturer Norvic incorporated a pair of their women's high-leg boots in the foundations of their new factory built in 1964, and an even more recent account comes from Knebworth House, where in 1991 an estate worker's shoe replaced an [...] "old court shoe" [...] that had been discovered behind some panelling. Nevertheless, only 50 post-1900 instances of concealed shoes have been recorded.|$|E

500|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Stroma were highly self-sufficient, and many practiced additional trades such as carpentry or roof-laying {{in addition to}} their [...] "day jobs" [...] in fishing or crofting. They built their own houses and boats, produced most of their own food, maintained farm equipment, shod their own horses, and made their own clothes, boots and <b>shoes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1920s they built their own wind turbines to recharge the batteries of their radio sets. By the end of the 19th century the island had three shops including a grocery. Any additional needs were met by purchasing supplies from shops at Wick and Thurso on the mainland or by mail-order from catalogues. For a while, they were also able to use the services of a floating shop which came periodically from Orkney to Stroma. Customers were rowed out to buy groceries, flour, animal feed, paraffin and clothes in exchange for lobsters, wet salted fish and eggs.|$|E

"Up and in": Mistakenly {{thought to}} be {{originated}} by World Champion Mike Massey, this shot has much earlier origins, and was done in 1980 in Sweden by European champion Bengt Jonasson of Stockholm. He showed it to the gentleman of the American team (Paul Gerni, Jim Rempe, and Mike Sigel) in an exhibition prior to the 1980 Swedish Open in Gothenburg, using a wooden shoe instead of a floppy cowboy boot, and prompting both Gerni and Rempe {{to stop at the}} gift shop at the Amsterdam airport {{on the way back to}} pick up some wooden <b>shoes.</b> <b>In</b> this shot, <b>the</b> cue ball is jumped off the table into a wooden shoe (a cowboy boot for Massey, 25 years later) on the floor, which made a nice [...] "klack" [...] sound <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of <b>the</b> wooden <b>shoe.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> U.S., the wooden shoe shot is sometimes referred to as [...] "the boot shot".|$|R

500|$|The tuft {{of grass}} {{sprouting}} from the roof's central truss above the figures conveys multiple meanings. Although the shrub is naturally rendered, Christus almost certainly placed it there for its symbolic value; its positioning suggests he followed {{a program of}} disguised iconography. The most obvious meaning is of new life and new beginnings. On a secular level, the shrub may have indicated Christus's membership in the Confraternity of the Dry Tree, which he joined sometime around 1462–63. [...] The confraternity was prestigious, including among its ranks Burgundian nobility, such as Philip the Good and his wife Isabella, wealthy foreign merchants and members from Bruges's upper classes. The tuft of grass also symbolizes the tree of life, and Upton theorizes that by placing it there, Christus [...] "has given expression to the legend" [...] of Adam's third son, Seth, whose quest for a branch was a popular legend in the medieval period. Furthermore, alludes to Moses and the burning bush. According to Upton, in Christus's Nativity Joseph assumes Moses's role of protector and law-bringer; just as Joseph has removed his pattens {{in the presence of}} Christ, Moses removed his <b>shoes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of the bush.|$|E
