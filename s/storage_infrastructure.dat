5|$|Titan uses Jaguar's 200 cabinets, {{covering}} 404 square meters (4,352 ft2), with replaced internals and upgraded networking. Reusing Jaguar's {{power and}} cooling systems saved approximately $20 million. Power is provided to each cabinet at three-phase 480 V. This requires thinner cables than the US standard 208 V, saving $1 million in copper. At its peak, Titan draws 8.2 MW, 1.2 MW more than Jaguar, but runs almost {{ten times as}} fast in terms of floating point calculations. In {{the event of a}} power failure, carbon fiber flywheel power storage can keep the networking and <b>storage</b> <b>infrastructure</b> running for up to 16 seconds. After 2 seconds without power, diesel generators fire up, taking approximately 7 seconds to reach full power. They can provide power indefinitely. The generators are designed only to keep the networking and storage components powered so that a reboot is much quicker; the generators are not capable of powering the processing infrastructure.|$|E

Experts claim that cold <b>storage</b> <b>infrastructure</b> will become economically viable only when there is strong and contractually binding demand from organised retail. The risk of cold storing perishable food, without an assured way to move and sell it, puts the economic viability of expensive cold storage in doubt.

40|$|Manual {{planning}} of <b>storage</b> <b>infrastructures</b> that {{are large and}} that utilize heterogeneous devices has become a time consuming and error prone process. This problem becomes even more complex when one is designing storage area network file system (SAN FS) based storage solutions. SAN FS systems that combine the benefits of both SAN and network attached (NAS) systems have been proposed as a mechanism for designing scalable <b>storage</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> This paper proposes a SAN FS capacity planning tool that takes application level requirements, best practices, {{and other types of}} policy input to design the necessary SAN FS logical and physical constructs. The planning tool can be used to design both new SAN FS deployments or extend existing SAN FS deployments. By automating the design process, this tool helps to cut down on time and the number of designers required to design large scale <b>storage</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Finally, there currently do not exist any planning tools for SAN file systems, and thus, this is the first paper in this regard...|$|R
