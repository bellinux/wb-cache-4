5|$|The {{goodwill}} {{generated by}} this surprising {{turn of events}} defused the situation, but to many observers the <b>scene</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> balcony was mere theatricality without long-term resonance. However pleased {{it may have been}} by the royal displays, the crowd insisted that the king come back with them to Paris.|$|E
5|$|Scott avoided using green screens unless necessary. Instead, he used various items so {{the actors}} would {{know where they}} should be looking in any {{particular}} <b>scene</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> practical sets where CGI elements would be inserted in post-production. Rapace said that green screens were used fewer than six times during filming. The production used five 3ality Technical Atom 3D rigs, four of which were configured with Red Epic 3D cameras set on camera dollies and tripods, which were continuously in use during filming. The fifth rig used an Epic camera as a steadicam, which was used only occasionally.|$|E
5|$|They {{decided to}} have a scene where Lisa and Bart visit Homer before his surgery and were unsure of how to do it, so they {{approached}} Brooks. Brooks made up the entire <b>scene</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot. Originally, the surgery was supposed to be performed by Dr. Hibbert, but it was later changed to Dr. Nick. In the original airing of the episode, Dr. Nick's phone number was the number of a real legal clinic, whose lawyers made them change it to 1-600-DOCTORB.|$|E
5000|$|All <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Reliant bridge {{were shot}} after <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Enterprise bridge, {{eliminating}} difficulty with continuity and conflicting shooting schedules.

50|$|There {{are seven}} {{scenes from the}} Sigurd legend carved <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two door panels, with three <b>scenes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first panel and four <b>scenes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second panel.

25|$|The nave has {{a series}} of Passion scenes along the south wall and Nativity <b>scenes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north. <b>The</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south wall are: the Entry into Jerusalem, the Last Supper, Christ washing the disciples' feet, the Betrayal of Christ, the Flagellation of Christ, Christ {{carrying}} his cross, the Crucifixion and the angel at the tomb.|$|R
5|$|When Lark {{received}} the first script, he was disappointed. He felt {{none of the}} characters were likable, and the scene Rucka had described to him over dinner was not included. Rucka wrote a new draft to address Lark's concerns and restored the missing opening scene. Lark began drawing the first issue in January 2013 and based the opening <b>scene</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> birth sequence in The Fifth Element.|$|E
5|$|With the plane, {{they land}} {{on an island}} which has the source for every dirty joke ever made, the base looks similar to a temple-compound from the 1979 film Apocalypse Now. The base is {{inhabited}} with many great minds including Warren Buffett (who was in a deleted <b>scene</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> DVD), Bill Gates, and Stephen Hawking where they pass their time writing the world's dirty jokes. It is shown that the first dead baby joke {{was written in the}} era of Ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The GWR {{attracted}} the attention of the artists from an early date. John Cooke Bourne's History and Description of the Great Western Railway was published in 1846 and contained a series of detailed lithographs of the railway that give readers a glimpse of what the line looked like in the days before photography. J. M. W. Turner painted his Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great Western Railway in 1844 after looking out of the window of his train on Maidenhead Railway Bridge, and in 1862 William Powell Frith painted , a large crowd <b>scene</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> platform at Paddington. The station itself was initially painted for Powell by W Scott Morton, an architect, and a train was specially provided by the GWR for the painting, in front of which a variety of travellers and railway staff form an animated focal point.|$|E

5|$|The spacewalk <b>scene</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Enterprise {{exterior}} {{was one of}} {{the most}} challenging sets to envision and construct for the film. The production had to design a space suit that looked practical rather than exaggerated. Fans were built into the helmets so that the actors would not get overheated, and neon lights built into the front so that the occupant's faces could be seen. When the actors first put the helmets on, the fully enclosed design made it hard to breathe; after a minute of wearing the suit Stewart became ill, and shooting was discontinued. The set for the ship's outer hull and deflector dish were built on gimbals at Paramount's largest sound stage, surrounded by bluescreen and rigged with wires for the zero gravity sequences. The stage was not large enough to accommodate a full-sized replica of the Enterprise dish, so Zimmerman had to scale down the plans by 15percent.|$|E
5|$|The pediments, metopes, and {{shield of}} the Parthenos all {{illustrate}} the mythological past {{and as the}} deities are observing on the east frieze, it is natural to reach for a mythological explanation. Chrysoula Kardara, has ventured that the relief shows us the first Panathenaic procession instituted under the mythical King Kekrops. This explanation would account {{for the absence of}} the allies and the ship, as these post-date the original practice of the sacrificial rite. In evidence she offers E35 as the future King Erichthonios presenting the first peplos to his predecessor Kekrops, iconographically similar to the boy’s depiction on a fragmentary kylix of the 450s. A recent interpretation by Joan Breton Connelly identifies the central <b>scene</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east frieze (hence above the door to the cella and focal point of the procession) not as the handing over of Athena’s peplos by the arrhephoroi, but the donning of sacrificial garb by the daughter of King Erechtheus in preparation for the sacrifice of her life. An interpretation suggested by the text of the fragmentary papyrus remains of Euripides’s Erichtheus, wherein her life is demanded in order to save the city from Eumolpos and the Eleusinians. Thus, the deities turn their backs to prevent pollution from the sight of her death. A contentious subject in the field, Connelly's {{solution to the problem of}} meaning poses as many problems as it answers.|$|E

Moments later, when lead interrogator Geir Hansen suggested that Andersen himself could be a victim in the case, Andersen delivered a full confession, naming 21-year-old Viggo Kristiansen as his accomplice.
