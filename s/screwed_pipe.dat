40|$|The project ”Investment {{proposal}} for grinding station for service work of screw feeders” has been performed {{during the spring}} semester 2014 for the course Bachelor’s thesis for degree of  Bachelor of science in machine engineering at Karlstad’s University. The project has been performed in cooperation with Fiber Workshop which is a service department in the company Valmet AB. Valmet AB {{is a company that}} develops and manufacture soft paper tissue machines. The screw feeder is a part that is used to feed, and squeeze out the water out of woodchips. The service work of the screw feeder mostly consists of service work on two major parts, namely the feeder screw and the split pipe, which the feeder screw is mounted in.   The purpose of the project was to evaluate the service work, namely the grinding in a working environment point of view. Another goal of the project was to present some improvements for this process.   The working environment which has been evaluated is primarily the risk of vibration damage in arm and hand, the risk of ergonomic musculoskeletal disorders and even a dust measurement has been performed, with the help of Hans-Olov Karlsson from the company Clarahälsan. The result from the working environment survey suggests that the operator exceed the work environment limits in regards to the risk of suffering damages from vibrations in the hand and arm. The grinding work of the split pipe {{is considered to be a}} bigger problem in regards to ergonomics than the grinding on the feeder <b>screw.</b> The split <b>pipe</b> requires the operator to stand in a posture that takes more concentration and precision than for the feeder screw. The results from the dust measurements indicate that the levels of dust in the air, during the grinding, are within the approved limits. The safety equipment used by the operator is adequate, there has however been a desire of the client to find a solution that manages the dust.   One of the improvement proposals consists mainly of a number of accessories for the grinder to help improve the problems with vibration and the dust. The possibilities to circumvent the grinding work for the <b>screw</b> <b>pipe</b> altogether have been examined. It is possible to begin to mill the <b>screw</b> <b>pipe</b> in the lathe, which has a powered tool. For it to be possible to mill the split pipe instead of grinding, the lathe machine is in need of an extension arm, to be able to reach down the whole split pipe. This arm has been designed and developed in this project...|$|R

For example, the hexagon shape is commonly called a [...] "6 point" [...] socket because the hexagon forms 6 [...] "points" [...] where walls intersect to create six sharp pointed corners. This system of description using [...] "points" [...] generally works well in avoiding confusion, with the exception of [...] "8-point" [...] and [...] "12-point" [...] where two very incompatible shapes exist with both having 8 [...] "points" [...] and 12 [...] "points". The vast majority of larger common nut and bolt heads are produced with the 6-point hexagonal gripping shape. Less frequently used shapes include the square 4-point, triple square 12-point (not to be confused with 12-point double hexagon), octagonal 8-point (not to be confused with the more common 8-point double square shape). These less common shapes are typically found in special applications or particular industries such as aircraft, PVC plumbing fittings or German and UK made automobiles. With rail cars, valve adjustment <b>screws</b> and <b>pipe</b> plugs the 4-point square shaped driver can still be found in wide use both male and female configurations. Nuts and bolt heads are also produced in 12-point double hexagon shapes and various types of splines more common to aircraft and aerospace applications. Most manufacturers of sockets for larger bolts produce them in 6-point (hexagonal) and limited sizes of 12-point (double-hexagonal) configurations.|$|R

This article presents a general description and analysis of available screw drives that have been used for in-pipe drives. The main focus is on the characteristic analysis of a novel variable radius screw drive mechanism that is proposed by the authors. The proposed mechanism is a two-stage planetary gearing system driven by a single motor. Major parameters of the mechanism, including helical angle, pitch and forward velocity, are derived. Furthermore, by conducting a force analysis, it is found that the proposed mechanism has much larger thrust force compared with that of the existing screw drive mechanism. A larger thrust force means that the proposed mechanism can carry more devices, thus perform more tasks inside pipes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, thrust force measurement experiments have been conducted...|$|R

The concept for the fuse is {{attributed}} to an Air America employee who grasped the idea during a night of drinking. Shortly thereafter, his drinking buddy, a Royal Lao Air Force airman at Louang Phrabang, gathered the needed materials for the prototype and started welding used aircraft gun barrels directly into the nose fuse cavity of bombs. After the concept proved itself useful it was made famous by being used for the largest conventional bomb in the U.S. military's arsenal at the time, the BLU-82. When used gun barrels were in short supply, water pipes were requisitioned for the task. The welded pipe versions had several adverse effects, such as vibration, pipe weld separation or breakage while in flight, and wind drag, due to impossibility of aligning the pipes correctly with {{the nose of the}} weapon, so that phase of development eventually gave way to threaded steel water <b>pipes</b> <b>screwed</b> into the nose cavity of the bombs, leaving only the tail fuse for detonation.

40|$|An {{electrically}} detonated downhole seismic gun (EDG) {{that will}} fire blank 8 -guage shells underwater has been constructed and tested to 80 m depth (hydrostatic pressures of 130 psi or 8. 9 x 105 Pa). Although other engineering seismic guns which fire blank or projectile sources are available, {{they are for}} near-surface shots and {{are not meant to}} be used for downhold seismic surveys in water-filled boreholes. The EDG was designed primarily for checkshot surveys (well travel-time surveys) and high-quality reflection/refraction tests, but potential applications include shallow vertical seismic profiling and borehole to borehole or borehole to surface tomography, as well as optimum offset and common midpoint seismic reflection surveys. The EDG consists off four steel subassemblies: (1) chamber; (2) breech; (3) pipe; and (4) hanger. A blank 8 -gauge electrical shell is held by the chamber and is detonated by an electrode located inside the breech. O-ring seals prevent water from entering the breech and causing short circuits. The breech is <b>screwed</b> into a <b>pipe</b> which is also fitted with o-ring seals to keep the internal wiring dry. A hanger subassembly provides a convenient attaching point for the hoist cable. Arming of the EDG with an explosives blaster occurs only after lowering to operating depth. The EDG has been tested with various size black powder loads up to 750 grains. Frequency bandwidth and repeatability tests were carried out under saturated conditions in a fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary section. These preliminary tests show significant frequency content in the 25 - 200 Hz band (peak near 100 Hz) for reflections from depths of 150 - 300 m, and acceptable waveform repeatability for different shot records obtained with identical geometry and acquisition parameters...|$|R
40|$|The fixator is {{a medical}} device that {{provides}} support to fractured biological structures. Metal biomaterials are mainly used for replacing broken or damaged hard tissues such as bones because of their high strenght, toughness and corrosion resistance. Materials such as stainless steel, titanium and aluminium alloys (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V), cobalt and chromium alloys, composite materials and other biocompatible materials are used in orthopedy for the stabilization of connective tissue injuries or {{as a substitute for}} the bone tissues. Fixators are classified according to the place of installation to external and internal fixators. Widely used medical fixators are pins, rods plates, <b>screws,</b> <b>pipes,</b> wires, nails and external fixators. Conventional and non-conventional methods of processing are used in the production process for all types of fixators. Introduction Fixators are medical devices manufactured to support damaged biological structures. In the field of orthopedic surgery that deals with skeletal disorders such as bone, spine, joints, muscles and tendons injuries and diseases, various metals, titanium and cobalt alloys etc. are used to stabilize the supporting tissue injuries or as a substitute for bone tissues. Metallic implants are frequently used in orthopedic surgery as joint prosthesis (hip, knee and elbow) fracture fixation devices (plates, screws, external fixators) and devices for the fixation of the spine. In principle, fixators are devided into external and internal ones, depending on the place of installation (outside or inside the body). The most common types of medical fixators are pins, rods and plates. This paper presents some of the most common materials used for the production of fixators, their processing and possibilties of use in medicine for various purposes. Types of fixators and materials used for their production Nowadays, biocompatible materials are usually used for the production of fixators and implants. These materials show good performances in contact with cells, tissues or body fluids. They are commonly used to replace or upgrade the structural components of the human body in order to compensate for damage that occures due to aging, illness or accidents. These materials should have the following features: non-toxicity, resistance to corrosion, durability, high strength, toughness at low values of elastic modulus. The most commonly used materials in orthopedic surgery are stainless steels (with austenitic and precipitation strengthening), cobalt-based super-alloys (e. g. cobalt-chromium alloys), titanium and its alloys and sometimes composite materials. However, titanium and its alloys are primarly used. The implants for joint prosthesis are the tubes that are inserted into the medullary canal of the bone in order to stabilize prosthesis and parts of the joint. In total hip prosthesis, the femoral prosthesis head is usually made ​​of cobalt-chromium alloys, while the component that replaces the femur is made of titanium alloys. Fracture fixators include plates, screws, wire, nails and external fixators. They are made of different metal alloys, mostly of titanium alloys. Methods of manufacturing and processing materials used for fixators in medicine The main characteristics of the research in the field of materials used for fixators are: 1) New analytical techniques and modern instruments for characterization of materials (e. g. tunnel scanning microscope and synchrotron) 2) Computer simulations 3) Recognition capabilities, visual representation and quantification of structural forms in the micro and nano world using computer modeling 4) The material is immediately formed in the approximatelly final form of the workpiece ("Net shape" and "near net shape" procedures) 5) Production of new materials is closely associated with the procedures that are usually called "Materials Technologies" Materials and parts obtained using the powder metallurgy Modern materials are obtained by optimizing the composition and microstructure of the material to the desired properties Classical procedures PM Nowadays, these methods achieve equal or even better properties than those obtained by traditional methods of metal forming. Methods of powder forming today are also used in the manufacture of ceramics and metal composites. Modern methods of the manufacturing in the nearly final shape ("net shape and near net shape technologies") They can be classified into three categories: 1) Consolidation methods used to achieve full density 2) Plasma spraying and Spray forming 3) Rapid Prototyping and rapid production of parts (Rapid Manufacturing) One of the most interesting processes to produce parts in one operation is the laser deposition process (sintering) of metal powders, layer by layer. The best known method of forming in semi-solid state is thixomoulding. A water jet cutting {{is one of the most}} innovative methods nowadays. The Water Jet is the process of cold processing using a jet of water, which allows to work with materials that previously could not be processed using traditional methods (or only with great difficulties). Development of new alloys for future use Titanium alloys, especially alloys α + β type such as Ti- 6 Al- 4 V are considered the most suitable biocompatible metallic materials due to their excellent combination of mechanical properties, corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. The basic idea in the development of new alloys for use in medicine is to replace aluminum and vanadium with niobium, tantalum and zirconium, in order to avoid the negative features of widely used Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. It is shown that the toxicity of these elements is extremely low. Some newly developed alloys are: Ti- 3 Al- 2, 5 V (α + β) Ti- 5 AL- 2, 5 Fe (α + β) Ti- 6 Al- 7 NB (α + β) Ti- 15 Mo (β); Ti- 13 Nb- 13 Zr (β) Ti- 12 mo- 6 Zr- 2 Fe (β) Ti- 45 Nb (β) Ti- 35 Nb- 7 Zr- 5 ta (β) Ti- 55, 8 Ni (intermetallic). The alloy that shows excellent properties is Ti- 13 Nb- 13 Zr. This alloy is a β-type titanium alloy. It is characterized by low values ​​ of elastic modulus and significantly improved strenhth compared to the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy, making it very attractive for applications in biomedical engineering. Conclusion Titanium and its alloys show significant advantages compared to other groups of biocompatible metallic materials used un medicine. Most of the materials studied in this article are not produced in Serbia, except for the stainless steel and certain alloys that can be produced in the Vinca Institut and the Sartid Smederevo company. However, there are a number of plants for processing of the studied materials, such Slovas from Cacak, Aquarez from Sremska Kamenica, etc. For example, Aquarez has CNC drives, as well as Water Jets. Similar plants can be found all around the former Yugoslavia, which is very important for manufacturing fixators and implants used in Serbia and beyond. It is of great importance that the production and processing of these materials is accurate and clean, in order to reduce potential human disorders (e. g. poisoning) to a minimum. </p...|$|R
