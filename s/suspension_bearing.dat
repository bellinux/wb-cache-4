40|$|Specific {{antiserum}} against Vibrio vulnificus he-molysin {{was prepared}} by immunizing rabbits with a liposome <b>suspension</b> <b>bearing</b> the hemolysin. A cholesterol-phosphatidylcholine-liposome suspen-sion was incubated with crude hemolysin prepara-tion, washed well and then injected intravenously (i. v.) into rabbits. Of the various proteins in the crude preparation, the hemolysin {{was the only}} protein which was able to bind to the liposomes, because V. vulnificus hemolysin possesses specific cholesterol-binding activity. Therefore, the anti-serum obtained could react only with the hemo-lysin.

They perform an image motion compensation with an accuracy of plus or minus 1 minute of arc. The structure is held in the vertical position by gravity; the azimuth is controlled by a torque motor in the <b>suspension</b> <b>bearing</b> using solar or geomagnetic references. The image motion compensation is performed by a flat mirror, located in front of the telescope, controlled by pitch and yaw servo-loops.

40|$|Compared with {{traditional}} mechanical inertially stabilized platform (ISP), magnetic suspension ISP (MSISP) can absorb high frequency vibrations via a magnetic <b>suspension</b> <b>bearing</b> system with five {{degrees of freedom}} between azimuth and pitch gimbals. However, force acting between rotor and stator will introduce coupling torque to roll and pitch gimbals. Since the disturbance of magnetic bearings has strong nonlinearity, classic state feedback control algorithm cannot bring higher precision control for MSISP. In order to enhance the control accuracy for MSISP, a disturbance compensator based on radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is developed {{to compensate for the}} disturbance. Using the Lyapunov theorem, the weighting matrix of RBFNN can be updated online. Therefore, the RBFNN can be constructed without priori training. At last, simulations and experiment results validate that the compensation method proposed in this paper can improve ISP accuracy significantly...|$|E
50|$|Like the Series 2, the {{traction}} motors of the Series 3 were also equipped with roller-type <b>suspension</b> <b>bearings.</b> On the Series 2 locomotives the arrangement {{consisted of a}} self-aligning ball bearing at the pinion end and a parallel roller bearing at the commutator end of the traction motor. The bearings were grease-lubricated and were carried in a split cannon box to which the traction motor was attached by means of two clamps that engaged cylindrically-machined seatings {{on the outside of}} the housing.

40|$|Novel {{graphene}} oxide bearing betaine moieties as sulfobetaine (GO-SB), carboxybetaine (GO-CB) and carboxybetaine ester (GO-CBE) moieties {{were prepared}} in two simple fabrication processes based on silanization and a thiol-ene click-reaction. Betaine modified particles showed appropriate electrical conductivity for electrorheological applications and the electrorheological behavior {{was confirmed by}} on-line microscopic observation. Analysis of the dielectric data using the Havriliak-Negami model showed that the <b>suspension</b> <b>bearing</b> the carboxybetaine ester moiety (GO-CBE) in silicone oil had the highest dielectric relaxation strength and fastest relaxation time due to enhanced charge transfer caused by a specific carboxybetaine ester feature. Analysis of the rheological data of the prepared suspensions at various external fields by the power-law model revealed that the conductivity mechanism {{is responsible for the}} electrorheological effect. Development of the internal structures was considerably improved for the GO-CBE sample with a yield stress up to 97 Pa at 5 wt% GO-CBE particles in suspension.

40|$|A {{magnetic}} bearing for passively suspending a rotatable element subjected to axial and radial thrust forces is disclosed. The {{magnetic bearing}} employs a taut wire stretched along the longitudinal {{axis of the}} bearing between opposed end pieces and an intermediate magnetic section. The intermediate section is segmented to provide oppositely directed magnetic flux paths between the end pieces and may include either an axially polarized magnets interposed between the segments. The end pieces, separated from the intermediate section by air gaps, control distribution of magnetic flux between the intermediate section segments. Coaxial alignment of the end pieces with the intermediate section minimizes magnetic reluctance in the flux paths endowing the bearing with self-centering characteristics when subjected to radial loads. In an alternative embodiment, pairs of oppositely wound armature coils are concentrically interposed between segments of the intermediate section in concentric arcs adjacent to radially polarized magnets to equip a magnetic bearing as a torsion drive motor. The magnetic <b>suspension</b> <b>bearing</b> disclosed provides long term reliability without maintenance with application to long term space missions such as the VISSR/VAS scanning mirror instrument in the GOES program...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to study}} a numerical analysis to investigate the dynamic orbits of a rotor supported by two turbulent journal bearings considering longitudinal and transverse roughness effect under nonlinear suspension. The dynamic response of the rotor center and bearing center are studied. The dynamic trajectories of the rotor center and bearing center, PoincarÃ© maps, bifurcation diagrams and the maximum Lyapunov exponent method are employed to analyze dynamic responses in this study. The results show that either the longitudinal and transverse or the values of roughness parameters c 1 would not affect strongly nonlinear rotor-bearing system very much but the difference of dynamic response between considering with roughness effect and without roughness effect are very obvious. The modeling results provide some theoretical references for further researching of rotor-bearing system for rotating machinery that operate in highly rotational speed, especially it considers roughness effect, turbulent flow and nonlinear <b>suspension</b> of <b>bearing</b> system...|$|R
40|$|In {{standard}} motor applications, traditional mechanical bearings {{represent the}} most economical approach to rotor suspension. However, in certain high performance applications, rotor <b>suspension</b> without <b>bearing</b> contact is either required or highly beneficial. Such applications include very high speed, extreme environment, or limited maintenance access applications. This paper extends upon a novel bearingless motor concept, in which full five-axis levitation and {{rotation of the}} rotor is achieved using two motors with opposing conical air-gaps. By leaving the motors' pole-pairs unconnected, different d-axis flux in each pole-pair is created, generating a flux imbalance which creates lateral force. Note this is approach is different than that used in previous bearingless motors, which use separate windings for levitation and rotation. This paper will examine the use of feedforward control to counteract synchronous whirl caused by rotor imbalance. Experimental results will be presented showing {{the performance of a}} prototype bearingless system, which was sized for a high speed flywheel energy storage application, with and without feedforward control...|$|R
