50|$|An {{aircraft}} {{fuel system}} allows the crew to pump, manage, and deliver aviation- or jet fuel to the propulsion system and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) of an aircraft. Fuel systems differ greatly due to different performance of the aircraft {{in which they are}} installed. A <b>single-engine</b> <b>piston</b> aircraft has a simple fuel system; a tanker (such as the KC-135), in addition to managing its own fuel, can also provide fuel to other aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuel level}} {{indication}} {{system in the}} simplest form is a transparent window on the tank side and in its usual application a float-driven potentiometer installed in the tank. After the TWA Flight 800 disaster, a revision was made to aircraft fuel systems to address the potential explosion hazard of electrical components located in the fuel tank. <b>Single-engine</b> <b>piston</b> aircraft fuel level systems moved to utilize float level gauges from the CNG and LPG industries which had the float drive a magnetic coupling and relocated the potentiometer outside the fuel tank.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first flight}} was the {{culmination}} of four years' design work by a team of 40 engineers, many formerly of Boeing and Raytheon, at TMS's Torrance, CA facilities under an entity referred to as Aviation Business Development Office (ABDO). Preliminary research and design was started by ISHIDA Aerospace, Inc. in Texas in the early 1990s and conceptual work completed during the mid-1990s under the guise of a small company created to keep the Toyota name isolated from the project at that stage. A Toyota official would only say, [...] "We are studying the potential for a <b>single-engine</b> <b>piston</b> plane but there is not a lot we can say." [...] Scaled Composites turned the Toyota engineers' design work into reality and hosted the flight test program at Mojave. Rutan, in a public address, called the aircraft [...] "the aeronautical equivalent to the Lexus LS400." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The number of nonfatal and fatal general aviation accidents decreased from 1999 through 2011; more than 200 fatal accidents occurred {{in each of those}} years. Airplanesparticularly <b>single-engine</b> <b>piston</b> airplanesflying personal operations were most often involved in accidents. Most general aviation accidents are attributed to pilot error and involved a loss of aircraft control. Some segments of the industry experienced accidents disproportionately to their total estimated annual flight hours. For example, among the airplane categories we reviewed, experimental amateur-built airplanes were involved in 21 percent of the fatal accidents but accounted for only 4 percent of the estimated annual flight hours. In another example, corporate operations were involved in about 1 percent of fatal accidents while accounting for 14 percent of estimated annual flight hours. We can draw some conclusions about general aviation accident characteristics, but limitations in flight activity and other data preclude a confident assessment of general aviation safety. The Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) survey of general aviation operators, on which the agency bases its annual flight-hour estimates, continues to suffer from methodological and conceptual limitations, even with FAAs efforts to improve it over the years. To obtain more reliable data, FAA has discussed requiring that flight-hour data be reported, such as during annual aircraft maintenance inspections. FAA has set a goal to reduce the fatal general aviation accident rate per 100, 000 flight hours by 10 percent from 2009 to 2018. However, given the diversity of the industry and shortcomings in the flight activity data, this goal is not sufficient for achieving reductions in fatality rates among the riskier segments of general aviation. Further, achieving the goal could mask continuing safety issues in segments of the community. ...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{software}} in commercial aviation has expanded {{over the last}} two decades, moving from commercial passenger transport down into <b>single-engine</b> <b>piston</b> aircraft. The most comprehensive and recent official guidance on software certification guidelines was approved in 1992 as DO- 178 B, before the widespread use of object-oriented design and complex aircraft systems integration in general aviation (GA). The new technologies present problems not foreseen by the original guidance material and may complicate demonstration of compliance with such guidance material. The Federal Aviation Administration has deferred to industry experts {{in the form of the}} Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) to create software and system approval guidance. The FAA's Advisory Circular (AC) 23. 1309 - 1 C created a four-tier approval system to reduce software and system approval burden on smaller aircraft, creating a lower standard for small aircraft in the hopes that safety gains from technology would outweigh the potential cost of defects from less stringent requirements. Further guidance regarding the role {{of software}} in the overall system is spread across other documents including Aerospace Recommended Practice (ARP) 4754, ARP 4761, and applicable SAE Aerospace Standards (AS). The guidance material, spread across several documents, lacks sufficient specificity to be of use to an everyday practitioner. In addition the guidelines are not necessarily rigorously enforced when the same artifacts are required at different levels of design assurance as stated within DO- 178 B itself. (cont.) After a literature review and regulatory analysis, this thesis investigates some example defects that escaped detection during application of the guidance in a real-world product, making specific recommendations to improve the guidance in a usable way. by Ryan Erwin Berk.

40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the year}} 2011, {{statistical}} data reports that the average age of general aviation registered aircraft is 46 years for <b>single-engine</b> <b>piston</b> powered aircraft and 15 years for single-engine turboprop aircraft. The average age for twin-engine 8 - 12 seats aircraft is 42 years for piston powered models and about 29 years for twin-engine turboprop commuter aircraft. These data show the need of a new aircraft model, also characterized by the application of new technologies like composite, light structures, new engine(with lower weight and fuel consumption), new avionics and flight control systems and new and advanced aerodynamics (i. e. optimized airfoil and winglet). Therefore, since the beginning of the year 2012, Tecnam Aircraft Industries and the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Naples Federico II are deeply involved in the design of a new commuter aircraft that should be introduced in this market with good opportunity of success. This research work provides some general guidelines on the conceptual design of a new twin-engine commuter aircraft with eleven seats highlighting some general features that are directly coming from market requirements. Aircraft configuration and cabin layout choices are shown and compared to similar solutions adopted by main competitors. The preliminary design has been accomplished through the classical semi-empirical approaches, under the guidance of Prof. Luigi Pascale, designer of all Tecnam aircraft. The preliminary design has been also supplied with aerodynamic analyses performed with a 3 -D panel code solver with the aim to verify the aircraft longitudinal and lateral-directional stability. To improve aircraft flight performance, in particular for the climb phase, winglets have been specifically design for this aircraft in order to reduce the wing induced drag. The aerodynamic analyses have been also addressed to a preliminary estimation of the wing loading, highlighting the effect of fuselage, nacelles and winglets. Identified the final layout and sizing of the aircraft, a 1 : 8. 75 scale model has been build by Tecnam Aicraft Industries, and a wide wind tunnel test campaign has been fulfilled in the main subsonic wind tunnel facility of the Department of Industrial Engineering. Wind tunnel test have been focused on the estimation of the general aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft. Several aircraft configurations have been tested in order to estimate the contribution of each aircraft component to the whole aircraft longitudinal and lateral-directional stability and control characteristics. To take into account the wind tunnel scaling effects providing more reliable data dealing with the free flight conditions, a wide numerical investigation through a Navier-Stokes equations solver has been performed. The reliability of the numerical investigation has been preliminary validated performing simulations at the wind tunnel conditions and comparing results with the available experimental data. The numerical analyses have been also useful to supply data not available form the wind tunnel tests, such as the accurate estimation of the wing span loads and stall path at free flight conditions (both in flap up and full flap configuration), a complete drag breakdown estimation (useful for aircraft performance estimation) and in order to predict the aircraft maximum lift coefficients(both in clean and flapped configuration). A preliminary investigation about the benefits that could be provided by the wing-fuselage fairing in terms of drag reduction, has been assessed through Navier-Stokes solver. Finally, an estimation of the aircraft flight performance has been fulfilled and effects of drag reduction in terms of maximum achievable cruise speed and fuel consumption an a typical possible mission profile has been presented...|$|E
