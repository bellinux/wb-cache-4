5|$|After the {{standoff}} entered its fourth hour, Valencia {{succeeded in getting}} Saldívar to confess that she had intended to shoot herself. Saldívar <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> placed the gun to her own head, Selena {{tried to tell her}} not to kill herself. When Selena opened the door to leave, Saldívar said she told her to close it. She also said the gun went off when Selena left. During the sixth hour, Saldívar agreed to give herself up, but when she saw a police officer pointing a rifle at her, she panicked, ran back to her truck, picked up the revolver, and pointed it at her head again. Saldívar surrendered after more than nine hours. By then, hundreds of Selena's fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away. A press conference was called within hours of Selena's murder; Saldívar had not yet been named in media reports. Assistant Police Chief Ken Bung and Quintanilla, Jr. told the press the possible motive was Selena's intention to terminate Saldívar's employment.|$|E
500|$|In Montgomery, Rosa Parks {{attended}} a rally for Till, led by Martin Luther King Jr. She soon after, {{refused to give}} up her seat on a segregated bus to a white passenger. The incident sparked a year-long well-organized grassroots boycott of the public bus system. The boycott was designed to force the city to change its segregation policies. Parks later <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> did not get up and move {{to the rear of the}} bus, [...] "I thought of Emmett Till and I just couldn't go back." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} and {{commercial}} success of [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in 2010, Eminem wanted to record an alternative version with Rihanna {{as the lead}} vocalist, viewing aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike the original, which featured Eminem as lead vocalist and was from a male perspective. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel: [...] "When I first heard the idea about doing a part two, I was just completely against it. I just felt like you couldn't beat the 'original'. There's {{no way you can}} outdo that, so why compete with it?". She <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first heard the original demo of the song in the studio with Eminem, sung by American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey, her reservations about recording it went away. While the demo was only accompanied by a piano, Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem.|$|E

500|$|Rowling {{was born}} to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce {{aircraft}} engineer, and Anne Rowling (née Volant), a science technician, on 31 July 1965 in Yate, [...] Gloucestershire, England, [...] northeast of Bristol. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. One of her maternal great-grandfathers, Dugald Campbell, was Scottish, born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was French, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War. Rowling originally believed he had won the Légion d'honneur during the war, as she <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> received it herself in 2009. She later discovered the truth when featured in an episode of the UK genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, in which she {{found out it was}} a different Louis Volant who won the Legion of Honour. When she heard his story of bravery and discovered the croix de guerre was for [...] "ordinary" [...] soldiers like her grandfather, who had been a waiter, she stated the croix de guerre was [...] "better" [...] to her than the Legion of Honour.|$|E
500|$|After the UK release, Dickon Stainer, head of Universal Classics and Jazz, {{spoke of}} plans to {{publicise}} Faryl in the US, saying [...] "America {{is going to}} be key. Because of her history on the talent show there's already a great deal of interest in her. The demand is intense." [...] In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the US. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well {{as it did in the}} UK. She said that [...] "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and that was like fresh in everyone's minds." [...] After the release, she was more optimistic, saying [...] "hen I performed in New York, it reminded me of the HMV signing in Kettering and there was quite a big queue so I think my album was well received." [...] Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> performed on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that [...] "I'm too young and don't think I would be able to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote Faryl. She said that [...] "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, but it is so difficult to make it over there ... They seem to like their own singers, but I will just keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for Wonderland, her second album, which was released in November.|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{seems very}} pretty," [...] she <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had {{finished}} it, [...] "but it's rather hard to understand!" [...] (You see she didn't like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn't {{make it out}} at all.) [...] "Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas—only I don't exactly know what they are! However, somebody killed something: that's clear, at any rate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shan Mei {{returns to}} Taiwan {{with no place}} to go. She cannot go home because her mother <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was leaving to China that if she went then she wouldn't be {{considered}} {{a member of the family}} anymore. Her best friend, Wang Ling Long (Zhang Yu Chen) was constantly nagging at her not to go and even said [...] "don't come crying to me." [...] Shan Mei decides to rent a place by using Frank's ring that the policeman had found. Her neighbouring tenant just happens to be no-one other than Frank.|$|E
2500|$|Izz al-Masri {{was escorted}} to the {{restaurant}} by Ahlam Tamimi, a 20-year-old female university student and part-time journalist, who had disguised herself as a Jewish tourist for the occasion. She later commented {{that she was not}} sorry for what she had done and does not recognize Israel’s existence. [...] "Despite the fact that I'm sentenced to 16 life sentences I know that we will become free from Israeli occupation and then I will also be free from the prison," [...] she <b>said.</b> <b>When</b> <b>she</b> first learned from a journalist who was interviewing her in jail that she had murdered eight children, not just three as she had initially believed, she just smiled broadly and continued with the interview.|$|E
2500|$|Anderson {{was sentenced}} to two days in jail for {{contempt}} of court for cursing her two children during a court-approved visit. [...] "This kind of conduct on her part has got to cease," [...] Circuit Judge Muriel Robinson Rice <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> sentenced Anderson. Rice stayed the sentence pending appeal. Rice eventually awarded {{custody of the children}} to Anderson's ex-husband, Harold Stream. The hearing concerned whether Anderson cursed her 12-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter in private during a court-approved visit with the children. Anderson, 43, and Stream, 42, were divorced in 1982 after four years of marriage. Anderson originally had custody of the children, but Stream won temporary custody while authorities investigated his allegations that his former wife had physically abused her children.|$|E

2500|$|... "Kill the Boy" [...] was {{initially}} {{expected to be}} the first single released by Sandé, due to Sandé's strong promotion of the song. There were a number of songs which have had media attention: [...] "Kill the Boy", [...] "Easier in Bed" [...] and [...] "Summer of Wonder". An acoustic version of [...] "Easier in Bed" [...] was released onto iTunes on 12 December 2012. [...] "Summer of Wonder" [...] is a song which was written by her and Naughty Boy, which was not used and instead she used the song title for her upcoming summer tour entitled Summer of Wonder Tour. [...] "Boys" [...] which was Cheryl Cole's B-side track to [...] "3 Words" [...] was originally for Sandé's album. However, she <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> heard Cole sing it, she loved how what the lyrics meant to Cole was different from what they meant to her when she wrote it, so Sandé decided to give the track to Cole.|$|E
2500|$|On August 3, 2008, People {{reported}} that Applegate {{had been diagnosed}} with breast cancer. This was confirmed by her representative who said in a statement, [...] "Christina Applegate was diagnosed with an early stage of breast cancer. Benefiting from early detection through a doctor-ordered MRI, the cancer is not life-threatening. Christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery. No further statement will be issued at this time." [...] On August 19, 2008, it was announced that Applegate was cancer free after a double mastectomy, though cancer was found in only one breast. She has an inherited genetic trait, a BRCA1 mutation, which can trigger breast cancer. Her mother, Nancy Priddy, is a breast cancer survivor. Applegate <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first was diagnosed, [...] "I was just shaking and then also immediately, I had to go into 'take-care-of-business-mode' which included a change to a more healthy diet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Solomon, while {{noting that}} Mozart's biographers often {{left out the}} [...] "crueler memories" [...] {{surrounding}} his death, stated, [...] "Constanze Mozart told Nissen that just before the end Mozart asked her what [...] Dr. Closset had <b>said.</b> <b>When</b> <b>she</b> answered with a soothing lie, he said, 'It isn't true,' {{and he was very}} distressed: 'I shall die, now when I am {{able to take care of}} you and the children. Ah, now I will leave you unprovided for.' And as he spoke these words, 'suddenly he vomited —it gushed out of him in an arc— it was brown, and he was dead.'" [...] Mozart's older, seven-year-old son Karl was present at his father's death and later wrote, [...] "Particularly remarkable is in my opinion the fact that a few days before he died, his whole body became so swollen that the patient was unable to make the smallest movement, moreover, there was stench, which reflected an internal disintegration which, after death, increased to the extent that an autopsy was impossible." ...|$|E
