In {{between these two}} there are different paths which represent one particular daily routine. That sensor sends a data packet with value 1 in case of detected motion. When the sensor permanently detects moving objects, it sends packets at a maximum speed of five seconds. After detecting no moving object for more than 1 minute, the sensor sends a packet with value 0. The system is not directly supported with the motion detector's <b>sensor</b> <b>values,</b> but with averaged <b>sensor</b> <b>values.</b> The 24 hours of a day are divided into 48 time slots, each 30 minutes long.
