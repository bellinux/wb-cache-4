40|$|<b>Sprint</b> {{performance}} {{is a critical}} factor in a vast majority of athletic events. <b>Sprint</b> {{performance is}} characterized by an athletes’ ability to <b>sprint</b> at maximal speeds. <b>Sprint</b> performance has recently been evaluated using various methodological approaches.

Recently, treadmill research has focused on the non-motorized treadmill However, the effects of <b>sprint</b> training on a motorized treadmill are still not fully understood. Therefore, the purpose of the proposed research is to investigate: 1) changes in <b>sprint</b> performance between experimental groups; 2) <b>sprint</b> training methods; and 3) determine if treadmill <b>sprinting</b> is replicative of overground <b>sprinting</b> following a 6 -week intervention. ...|$|R
5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. Riders received points for finishing {{in the top}} fifteen positions in a stage finish, or in intermediate <b>sprints</b> during the stage.

5|$|In the 2015 Tour of Qatar, three {{different}} jerseys were awarded. The {{first of these}} was the general classification. It was calculated by adding together the times recorded in each stage of the race, then making adjustments {{to take account of}} bonus seconds won for stage victories and intermediate <b>sprints</b> in the road stages (the winner of the individual time trial did not receive bonus seconds). The winner of each stage received a ten-second bonus; the rider coming second received a six-second bonus; the third rider across the line received a four-second bonus. Similarly, the winner, second-placed and third-placed riders in intermediate <b>sprints</b> won three-, two- and one-second bonuses respectively. If two riders were tied on the same time, the precise time (to one-hundredths of a second) recorded in the time trial would have been used to separate the riders. The leader of the general classification wore a gold jersey and the winner of the competition is considered the overall winner of the race.|$|E
5|$|In the Tirreno-Adriatico, four {{different}} jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses in intermediate <b>sprints</b> {{and at the}} finish in mass-start stages, the leader received a blue jersey. This classification was considered {{the most important of}} the Tirreno-Adriatico, and the winner was considered the winner of the race itself.|$|E

5|$|Menchov was fifth after Alpe di Siusi, but rose {{to second}} before stage 12, the {{very long and}} hilly {{individual}} time trial in Cinque Terre. There, he claimed a convincing victory; only Levi Leipheimer finished within a minute of Menchov's winning time. Di Luca was nearly two minutes slower than him, finished sixth on the stage, and fell to second overall, with Menchov assuming the race lead. Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov during the remaining mountain stages {{to make up the}} time difference, which was never more than a minute. The two riders were involved in <b>sprints</b> for time bonuses at the finish line in stages 16 and 17, as well as an intermediate sprint in stage 20. Menchov was consistently quicker than Di Luca in these <b>sprints.</b> With his superior time-trial skills providing the difference in the final stage, the Russian was able to emerge as Giro champion, despite a dramatic fall in the final kilometre before the finish line.|$|E
5|$|Robert Johnson was Vin Lanana's first hire, {{originally}} to lead throws, hurdles, and <b>sprints,</b> then in 2009, {{was named}} the associate head coach for women's track.

5|$|Thanks to {{the time}} bonus on the finish line, Kristoff was now in third place overall, just 11 seconds behind Terpstra.
