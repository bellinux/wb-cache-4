5|$|After {{saying goodbye}} to {{everyone}} in the bar, Diane returns to the office and accidentally hits Sam's nose when she opens the door. Because of that, she is convinced that Sam was coming out of the office to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to her. They argue, admit their feelings for each other, and come into the terms that their relationship with Derek is nothing compared to their potential relationship together. Sam and Diane embrace, but then Diane rejects his advances, i.e. attempts to kiss her. They insult each other and, at the end, kiss passionately.|$|E
5|$|Dixon is {{a patron}} of the African-Caribbean Leukaemia Trust (ACLT) which is a {{voluntary}} charity, whose main aim {{is to increase the}} number of Black and Mixed Parentage people on the UK Bone Marrow Register. The members of the ACLT freely volunteer their time in attempting to raise awareness in the Black community; enabling potential donors to come forward and be involved in the process of offering hope and a healthy future to someone whose disorder may otherwise prove fatal. Dixon has also backed Nickelodeon's See Something, <b>Say</b> <b>Something</b> campaign, a UK anti-bullying initiative.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, Phoenix's {{reputation}} takes a hit when {{he fails to}} properly defend a former client, Maggey Byrde, against accusations that she poisoned a talented programmer, Glen Elg. Convinced that someone impersonated him, Phoenix secures a retrial and conducts his own investigation. He discovers that Elg was developing a computer virus on behalf of loan shark Furio Tigre, and that Tigre, needing money to repay a large debt, killed him to steal it, then arranged for Maggey to take the fall. With no conclusive evidence, Phoenix manages to get Tigre arrested by making him <b>say</b> <b>something</b> only the real killer would know.|$|E
5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> profound about human nature.|$|E
5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to him. I decided against it.|$|E

5|$|While {{appearing}} in Don't Just Lie There, <b>Say</b> <b>Something!</b> at the Metro Theatre, Sydney in 1971, Terry-Thomas felt unwell and visited a doctor, who noticed his patient's left hand was shaking slightly; the doctor suggested a visit, {{upon his return}} to the UK, to a specialist, who diagnosed the actor with Parkinson's disease. Fearing the condition would affect offers of work, he did not make the news public, but as the symptoms began to manifest themselves in tremors, a shuffling gait, stooped posture and affected speech, he made the news known—partly to stop rumours of on-set drunkenness.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans {{would have been better}} off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E

25|$|The atheistic {{conclusion}} is that the arguments and evidence both indicate there is insufficient {{reason to believe that}} any gods exist, and that personal subjective religious experiences <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about the human experience rather than the nature of reality itself; therefore, one has {{no reason to believe that}} a god exists.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{exception}} to the above may be the Grelling–Nelson paradox, in which words and meaning are {{the elements of the}} scenario rather than people and hair-cutting.

50|$|Asking a {{question}} {{is an example}} of what Austin called an illocutionary act. Other examples would be making an assertion, giving an order, and promising to do something.

25|$|The {{value of}} the object can be {{increased}} by {{the way in which}} it is given and several authors have pointed to the fact that organs given in altruistic manner acquire greater social worth. Organs given in altruistic manner are thought to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about the moral character of the people who give them.

25|$|The ED {{period is}} the first {{for which it is}} {{possible}} to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about the ethnic composition of the population of Southern Mesopotamia. This {{is due to the fact}} that texts from this period contain sufficient phonetic signs to distinguish separate languages. They also contain personal names, which can potentially be linked to an ethnic identity. The textual evidence suggests that Southern Mesopotamia during the ED period was primarily occupied by Sumerians, who spoke Sumerian (a language isolate). It is still debated whether the Sumerian language was already in use during the Uruk period.|$|E
