40|$|Abstract: Drilling {{force and}} {{temperature}} of tibia {{at the high}} speed drilling for improving the design of surgical drills are very important. In this paper we describe experiments using pig tibia bones, measuring the drilling force and temperature of a new design of drill bit and compare the results against a twist drill. The result shows that the drilling force and temperature {{are affected by the}} feed rate and drilling speed, which vary with the drilling depth into the bone. The new surgical drill with three top cutting edges can achieve lower temperature below 47 o C and lower drilling force than with the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>twist</b> drill and carbide twist drill...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{emulation}} {{study of}} the drilling mechanism by general purpose twist drills is conducted by using FEM analysis software Deform- 3 D. Application of finite element software Deform- 3 D, some characteristic parameters of the work piece and the cutting tool material are combined. The load boundary conditions and the friction between tool rake face and chip are analyzed and defined. The chip separation criteria are chosen. The finite element analysis simulation of pretreatments is completed. By the finite element simulation analysis, the three-dimensional FEM model of twist drill is build. The scraps forming process and the distributed situation of cutting force ， cutting temperature in the drilling process are analyzed. The effect of cutting variables on drilling forces of stainless steel is analyzed. The drilling temperature and the drill wear condition are discussed. The effect of the main geometric parameters on the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>twist</b> drill drilling performance is studied...|$|E
40|$|When {{selecting}} hole-making sequences, the {{positional accuracy}} mainly is determined {{during the first}} drilling operation. This dissertation consists of three papers which consider the influence of various factors on hole positional accuracy when drilling in inclined workpieces using high-speed <b>steel</b> <b>twist</b> drills with conventional point geometry. The chisel edge action, {{during the first few}} revolutions after contact with an inclined workpiece surface, causes the drill wandering phenomenon and thus the drill deflection. The influence of factors like drill length, rigidity, workpiece material, surface slope, and cutting resistance, as well as the machining data has been investigated in experiments, results of which have been presented and discussed. Mechanisms of chip formation at the chisel edge also have been investigated. A mathematical model for chip areas and corresponding cutting forces has been proposed and implemented in a computer program. If the flexibility of the drill also is implemented in it, as suggested in my equations, the program can be used to analyze the drill wandering...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if the type of ligation influences the frictional resistance between stainless steel wire and brackets when the wire is subjected to repeated vertical displacements. Methods: Eight different types of ligation were used to secure a length of stainless steel wire in three stainless steel twin brackets. The wire was subjected to repeated vertical displacements in a simulated extraction space. Eighty per cent of the minimum force required to overcome static friction (F-m) between the wire and brackets {{was applied to the}} wire for eight minutes and any sliding measured. Results: Frictional resistance to sliding was least when stainless steel ligatures twisted in a figure 8 pattern until taut then untwisted one quarter turn were used, and greatest when elastomeric modules in a figure 8 pattern (EM 8) were used. The F-m difference between fully engaged standard and Super Slick elastomeric modules was significantly different (p = 0. 007). The frictional resistance to sliding fell when the wire was secured with either of these two methods and subjected to vertical displacement loads. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of wire movement between these modules. Conclusion: Repeated vertical displacement reduced the frictional resistance to sliding for all methods of ligation except EM 8. The stainless <b>steel</b> <b>twist</b> ligatures demonstrated the lowest frictional resistance to sliding. Nathawut Sirisaowaluk, Olena Kravchuk and Christopher T. C. Ho[URL]...|$|E
40|$|Cathodic arc {{evaporation}} (CAE) is {{a widely}} used technique for generating highly ionised plasma from which hard, wear-resistant PVD coatings can be deposited. A major drawback of this technique is the emission of micrometer-sized droplets of cathode material from the arc spot, which are {{commonly referred to as}} ‘macroparticles’. In this study, the effect of cathode poisoning was investigated as a method {{to reduce the number of}} macroparticles in PVD coatings. While the study focuses on the reduction of macroparticles in titanium nitride coatings, the outcomes and key findings can be broadly applied to the cathodic arc process, in particular, for the reduction of macroparticles in more advanced CAE coatings. The results support earlier findings that have shown that poisoning of the cathode can reduce the number of macroparticles emitted from the arc spot. The results of glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GD-OES) showed that the titanium content of the coatings varied little between the respective coatings despite changes in the deposition pressure from 0. 1 to 1. 2 Pa. The GD-OES results also showed the presence of oxide contamination at the surface of the coatings, which was significantly reduced with increasing deposition pressure. The coatings were also deposited onto high-speed <b>steel</b> <b>twist</b> drills to compare the metal-cutting performance when dry drilling a workpiece of cast iron. The results of the drill tests showed that tool life increased with a reduction in the number of macroparticles. <br /...|$|E

40|$|AbstractToday steel-wire ropes {{are used}} as a {{pre-stressed}} reinforcement for the large-span reinforced concrete structures that are considered as solid isotropic bars. Meanwhile, it's not taken into account that the rope represents a composite structure with the axial spiral anisotropy of properties, where a combined strain-stress state (SSS) occurs. On the basis of Kirchhoff differential equations for thin curved bars, the author develops a generic mathematical model of the <b>steel</b> <b>twisted</b> rope with a linear contact of wires. This model enables one to determine a combined strain-stress state of the rope elements taking into consideration its geometrical characteristics (wire size, twist angle of a twisted rope) and mechanical characteristics of steel (elasticity and shear moduli). The paper presents calculation of irregularity of stress distribution between a core and wires of the steel rope К- 7 (1 + 6) in case of different rates of wire twisting. Knowing the real strain-stress state in the steel rope elements, one can specify an effective pre-stressing of the rope...|$|R

This is why the construction date of the Jammer on Kartamyshevskaya is 1956 or earlier due to the Jammer on Kartamyshevskaya was lower. Possibly, this Jammer can explain the double official name of this street from 1945 to 1953: Street of Suharyeva and Petrovskogo Street.|$|R

50|$|The <b>steel</b> wire double <b>twisted</b> <b>steel</b> {{wire mesh}} {{was used in}} the {{manufacture}} of many different products for numerous applications. Galvanising the steel wire with zinc was a standard approach within the wire industry. In the 1950s and 1960s PVC coating was added to the wire to offer a longer design life, especially in more demanding applications. This new coating technology was useful when the Reno Mattress was invented soon afterwards; a larger flatter gabion with a smaller mesh size, used for river erosion protection works. Maccaferri’s products were used to reconstruct roads and river banks following the devastating floods in Florence in 1966.|$|R
