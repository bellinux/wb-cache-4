5|$|Hamusim are pickled {{vegetables}} made by <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> {{water and}} salt (and sometimes olive oil) {{in a pot}} and withdrawing them from air. Ingredients can include: cucumber, cabbage, eggplant, carrot, turnip, radish, onion, caper, lemon, olives, cauliflower, tomatoes, chili pepper, bell pepper, garlic and beans.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis is {{well suited}} to drying—its flavour intensifies, it is easily reconstituted, and its {{resulting}} texture is pleasant. Reconstitution is done by <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too {{can be used in}} subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. Some of this content is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these reports}} of toxicity, L.torminosus {{mushrooms}} are prepared in Finland, Russia, and other northern and eastern European countries by parboiling, <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> brine for several days, or pickling, after {{which it is}} valued for its peppery taste. In Norway, it is roasted and added to coffee. Mushrooms are harvested for commercial sale in Finland. The nutrient composition of Finnish specimens has been analyzed and found to contain the following components (as a percentage of dry weight): protein, 17.2%; phosphorus, 0.46%; calcium, 0.12%; magnesium, 0.088%; potassium, 2.97%; sodium 0.011%.|$|E

5|$|Use of this {{mushroom}} as a {{food source}} also seems to have existed in North America. A classic description of this use of A.muscaria by an African-American mushroom seller in Washington, D.C., in the late 19th century is described by American botanist Frederick Vernon Coville. In this case, the mushroom, after parboiling, and <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> vinegar, is made into a mushroom sauce for steak. It is also consumed {{as a food}} in parts of Japan. The most well-known current use as an edible mushroom is in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. There, it is primarily salted and pickled.|$|E
5|$|Silkworms, the {{caterpillars}} and pupae of {{the moth}} Bombyx mori, have been reared to produce silk in China from the Neolithic Yangshao period onwards, c. 5000 BC. Production spread to India by 140 AD. The caterpillars are fed on mulberry leaves. The cocoon, produced after the fourth moult, {{is covered with}} a continuous filament of the silk protein, fibroin, gummed together with sericin. In the traditional process, the gum is removed by <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> hot water, and the silk is then unwound from the cocoon and reeled. Filaments are spun together to make silk thread. Commerce in silk between China and countries to its west began in ancient times, with silk known from an Egyptian mummy of 1070 BC, and later to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The silk road leading west from China was opened in the second century AD, helping to drive trade in silk and other goods.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Breast muscles from spent hens were tenderized before cooking. Taste panel scores, shear press measurements, and {{percentage}} of cooking loss, shrinkage, and soak pickup of fillets treated with papain, bromelin, or ficin alone or in combination with sodium chloride and phos-phate solutions were determined using a balanced incomplete block design with eight replications per treatment. There {{were no significant differences}} between treatments for flavor, overall accepta-bility, or percentage of shrinkage. Samples that were blade-tenderized were significantly more tender than the controls, and samples <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> solutions of. 002 % papain,. 003 % bromelin, and. 002 % ficin were significantly more tender than the blade-tenderized controls. Fillets <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> papain were significantly more tender than those <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> solutions of either bromelin or ficin. Samples <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> 1 % sodium chloride and 6 % Kena FP- 28 alone were as tender as those <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> solutions of either bromelin or ficin. Fillets <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> solutions of 1 % sodium chloride and 6 % Kena FP- 28 plus either papain, bromelin, or ficin were significantly more tender than all other treatments. Those treated with sodium chloride plus Kena FP- 28 plus papain were the most tender. Taste panel values and shear press values for tenderness gave a correlation coefficient of r=—. 984.

5|$|When collected, {{the skin}} of the cap is left intact, and dirt is brushed off the surface. Pores are left unless old and soft. Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and aroma. Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. They are easily reconstituted by <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|E

40|$|Leaf extract of Jatropha curcas {{potentially}} as inhibitors of histamine formation on frigate tunaThe {{study of}} the inhibition of histamine formation on the frigate tuna using jatropha leaf extract has been done. Jatropha leaf macerated in stages ranging from hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol. Results of preliminary research note that the ethyl acetate extract and methanol with a concentration of 1 % (w / v) is the best extract that provides antibacterial activity against several of histamine-forming bacteria. In this experiment, frigate tuna were divided into 3 groups, group 1 was soaked for 30 minutes in water, group 2 soaked for 30 minutes in a solution of ethyl acetate extract of leaf jatropha with a concentration of 1 %, and group 3 was soaked for 30 minutes in a solution of methanol extract of leaf jatropha with a concentration of 1 %. After that, frigate tuna stored {{at room temperature for}} 5 hours, then analyzed the number of bacterial colony with total plate count method (TPC), number of histamine-forming bacteria and histamine levels. The results showed that the value of TPC the frigate tuna its <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> water are log 6. 68 (cfu / g), <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> a solution of ethyl acetate extract are log 4. 94 (cfu / g) and <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> a solution of methanol extract are log 5. 61 (cfu / g). The number of histamine-forming bacteria in the frigate tuna its <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> water are log 5. 62 (cfu / g), <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> a solution of ethyl acetate extract are log 4. 40 (cfu / g) and <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> a solution of methanol extract are log 5. 54 (cfu / g). histamine levels of the frigate tuna its <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> water are 17. 73 mg / kg, <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> a solution of ethyl acetate extract are 11. 07 mg / kg and <b>soaked</b> <b>in</b> a solution of methanol extract are 14. 02 mg / kg. Thus, the ethyl acetate extract of leaves of Jatropha is more effective to inhibiting the growth of histamine-forming bacteria and inhibit the formation of histamine in fresh frigate tuna that stored for 5 hours at room temperature...|$|R

25|$|Primers are a more {{problematic}} issue. If a primer is not seated deeply enough, the cartridge (if loaded) can be pulled, and the primer re-seated with the seating tool.

25|$|Scarification mimics natural {{processes}} that weaken the seed coat before germination. In nature, some seeds require particular conditions to germinate, {{such as the}} heat of a fire (e.g., many Australian native plants), or <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> a body of water {{for a long period of}} time. Others need to be passed through an animal's digestive tract to weaken the seed coat enough to allow the seedling to emerge.|$|E
25|$|Leaching or the <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> water removes {{chemical}} inhibitors in some {{seeds that}} prevent germination. Rain and melting snow naturally accomplish this task. For seeds planted in gardens, running water is best—if soaked in a container, 12 to 24 hours of soaking is sufficient. Soaking longer, especially in stagnant water, {{can result in}} oxygen starvation and seed death. Seeds with hard seed coats can be soaked in hot water to break open the impermeable cell layers that prevent water intake.|$|E

25|$|After <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> {{water to}} make the skins workable, the skins were placed on a {{stretching}} frame. A simple frame with nails would work well in stretching the pelts. The skins could be attached by wrapping small, smooth rocks in the skins with rope or leather strips. Both sides would be left open to the air {{so they could be}} scraped with a sharp, semi-lunar knife to remove the last of the hair and get the skin to the right thickness. The skins, which were made almost entirely of collagen, would form a natural glue while drying and once taken off the frame they would keep their form. The stretching aligned the fibres to be more nearly parallel to the surface.|$|E
25|$|Fillings in {{pastries}} {{are sometimes}} made of finely ground poppy seeds mixed with butter or milk and sugar. The ground filling {{is used in}} poppy seed rolls and some croissants and may be flavored with lemon or orange zest, rum and vanilla with raisins, heavy cream, cinnamon, and chopped blanched almonds or walnuts added. For sweet baked goods, sometimes instead of sugar a tablespoon of jam, or other sweet binding agent, like syrup is substituted. The poppy seed for fillings are best when they are finely and freshly ground because this will {{make a big difference}} in the pastry filling's texture and taste. Some recipes for Mohnstriezel use poppy seed soaked in water for two hours or boiled in milk. A recipe for Ukrainian poppyseed cake recommends preparing the seeds by immersing in boiling water, straining and <b>soaking</b> <b>in</b> milk overnight.|$|E
