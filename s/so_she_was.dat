5|$|For the {{remainder}} of her career, Connecticut sailed to various places in both the Atlantic and Pacific while training newer recruits to the Navy. However, {{the provisions of the}} 1922 Washington Naval Treaty stipulated that many of the older battleships, Connecticut among them, would have to be disposed of, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> decommissioned on 1 March 1923 and sold for scrap on 1 November 1923.|$|E
5|$|In casting, Nancy Cartwright {{originally}} planned {{to audition for}} the role of Lisa, while Yeardley Smith tried out for Bart. Smith's voice was too high for a boy, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> given the role of Lisa. Cartwright found that Lisa was not interesting at the time, so instead auditioned for Bart, which she thought was a better role.|$|E
5|$|Re di Portogallo saw {{action at}} the Battle of Lissa during the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. She engaged several Austrian wooden vessels in the melee, {{including}} ship of the line , which rammed Re di Portogallo but inflicted no significant damage. The ship's career after the war was very limited; in 1871, she was converted into a training ship. By 1875, her wooden hull {{was found to have}} deteriorated badly, and <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Friends {{and others}} {{sympathetic}} to the family attended, and when word of it reached Roger Nowell, he decided to investigate. On 27 April 1612, an inquiry was held before Nowell and another magistrate, Nicholas Bannister, to determine {{the purpose of the}} meeting at Malkin Tower, who had attended, and what had happened there. As a result of the inquiry, eight more people were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial: Elizabeth Device, James Device, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John Bulcock, Jane Bulcock, Alice Grey and Jennet Preston. Preston lived across the border in Yorkshire, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sent for trial at York Assizes; the others were sent to Lancaster Gaol, to join the four already imprisoned there.|$|E
5|$|Re d'Italia {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the Italian fleet until moments before the Battle of Lissa on 20 July 1866; Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano's hasty transfer to another vessel deprived the fleet of central command, and in the ensuing melee, Re d'Italia was rammed and sunk. Re di Portogallo was also rammed, but was not seriously damaged and she survived the action. The ship remained in service until 1871, when she became a training ship; this service did not last long, as the green wood used to build her hull had badly deteriorated by 1875, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sold and broken up for scrap that year.|$|E
5|$|She was {{modified}} at Chatham Dockyard {{for use as}} a target ship between 6 December 1920 and 8 April 1921. The ship was rewired for radio control and stripped; the 12-inch turrets remained aboard, but all of her guns and their equipment were removed, as were her torpedo equipment, flying deck, sea cabins, main derrick and boat equipment, lower conning tower, masts and yards, most of her crew amenities, and other unnecessary equipment. Unnecessary hatches, coamings, scuttles, and lifts were removed and plated over, and she was ballasted differently than she had been as a battleship. It was not intended to sink her, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> assigned a crew of 153 to maintain and operate her when she was not under fire.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{primarily}} intended for colonial duties, and she served in this capacity {{as part of}} the East Asia Squadron until she was relieved in 1909, at which point she returned to Germany. The ship was rebuilt between 1910 and 1914, and after the start of World War I, she was briefly used as a coastal defense ship. She proved inadequate to this task, and <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> withdrawn from active duty and served as a training ship for engineers {{until the end of the}} war. Fürst Bismarck was decommissioned in 1919 and sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Upon commissioning, Emperor of India {{joined the}} 4th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet, based at Scapa Flow. She {{took part in}} {{numerous}} sorties into the northern North Sea to enforce the blockade of Germany, along with frequent training exercises and gunnery drills. Emperor of India was in dock for a refit in late May 1916, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> unavailable for the Battle of Jutland. The increased danger from submarines led both the Grand Fleet and the German High Seas Fleet to pursue more cautious strategies after Jutland, {{which led to a}} less eventful war.|$|E
5|$|Wu's {{older brother}} died in 1958, {{her father in}} 1959 and her mother in 1962. At that time the United States {{government}} had severe restrictions on its citizens' ability to travel abroad, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not permitted to visit China to attend their funerals. She saw her uncle Wu Zhou-Zhi and younger brother Wu Chien-Hao again {{on a trip to}} Hong Kong in 1965. After the 1972 Nixon visit to China, {{relations between the two countries}} improved, and she was able to visit China again in 1973. By this time her uncle and brother had perished in the Cultural Revolution, and the tombs of her parents had been destroyed. She was greeted by Chou En-Lai, who personally apologized for the destruction of the tombs. After this, she returned to China a number of times.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Germany, Emden {{was assigned to}} training duties once again. She continued in this role until June 1942, by which time a major overhaul was in order. The refit was completed in Wilhelmshaven, after which Emden returned to training cadets. In September 1944, she was deployed to Norway, where she served as the flagship of the minelaying forces there. While in Norway, she participated in several minelaying operations through October, when she was transferred to convoy escort duty; her primary task was to protect convoys {{in and out of}} Oslo. This lasted until December, when she ran aground in the Oslofjord off the island of Flateguri. Her guns were removed while repairs were partially effected in the Schichau-Werke. Before departing East Prussia, she took on the remains of Paul von Hindenburg and his wife to carry them to mainland Germany. They had been disinterred to prevent them from falling {{into the hands of the}} advancing Soviet Army. The repair work on the ship was not yet completed, and <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> towed to Pillau, where the Hindenburgs' remains were taken off. Emdens engines were put back in working order, though she was incapable of reaching top speed, and her guns were reinstalled.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Germany, she resumed training duties in the Baltic. She was withdrawn from service in May 1938 {{for a major}} modernization. The funnels were modified with raked caps and searchlight platforms on their sides. The ship's 8.8cm guns were replaced with more powerful 10.5cm guns. Work lasted until November 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II. She spent {{the next several months}} on trials and training maneuvers. On 4 January, Karlsruhe and the minelayer Schiff 23 were sent to intercept the Swedish steamer Konung Oscar, which was transporting Polish refugees from Riga to Sweden. Karlsruhe caught the Swedish vessel, declared it a prize, and sent it and the 41 Poles aboard to Memel. She was not ready for combat operations by the start of Operation Weserübung, <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> used as a troop transport for the attack on Kristiansand. The attack force also included an E-boat tender, four large torpedo boats, and several E-boats.|$|E
5|$|Both Irene and Prinzess Wilhelm saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the German fleet. Irene frequently escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht on cruises throughout Europe. In 1894, Irene was deployed to East Asian waters; Prinzess Wilhelm joined her the following year. Prinzess Wilhelm {{was one of}} three ships involved in the seizure of the naval base Kiaochou Bay in November 1897, led by Admiral Otto von Diederichs. Irene was in dock for engine maintenance at the time, and <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not present during the operation. As a result of the seizure, the Cruiser Division was reorganized as the East Asia Squadron. Both ships were present in the Philippines {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Battle of Manila Bay between American and Spanish squadrons during the Spanish–American War in 1898. Diederichs hoped to use the crisis as an opportunity to seize another naval base in the region, though this was unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|HMS Gallant (H59) was a G-class destroyer, {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent {{considerable}} time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of}} the conflict. Gallant was transferred from the Mediterranean Fleet shortly after the beginning of World War II to the British Isles, to escort shipping in local waters. She was slightly damaged by German aircraft during the evacuation of Allied troops from Dunkirk at the end of May 1940. Following repairs, Gallant was transferred to Gibraltar and served with Force H for several months. In November, the ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, where she escorted several convoys. She struck a mine in January 1941 and was towed to Malta for repairs. These were proved extensive and Gallant was further damaged by near-misses during an air raid in April 1942, before they were completed. The additional damage made the ship uneconomical to repair <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> scuttled as a blockship in 1943. Her wreck was broken up in 1953.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Roma {{took part}} in a naval {{demonstration}} off Ragusa in an attempt to force the Ottoman Empire to comply with the terms of the Treaty of Berlin and turn over the town of Ulcinj to Montenegro. The following year, she was involved in a collision with the ironclad , though neither ship was damaged. That year, Venezia was converted into a torpedo training ship, while Roma remained in service until 1890, when she became a guard ship at La Spezia. In 1895, both ships were stricken from the naval register. Venezia was broken up for scrap the following year, but Roma was converted into a depot ship in La Spezia. On 28 July 1896, she was set on fire by a lightning strike and badly burned. The damage proved to be beyond economical repair, and <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Stevens {{arrived in}} Washington {{to take part}} in the June {{picketing}} of the Senate. She did not plan to stay, but Alice Paul convinced her to do <b>so.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> hired by the NAWSA, and was assigned to the newly formed Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (CUWS), which had been created by Alice Paul and Mary Ritter Beard. At that time, the Congressional Union was a subdivision of the NAWSA, though it operated independently. Stevens was hired to serve as executive secretary in Washington, D. C., as well as serve as regional organizer and was assigned the eastern district. Paul had divided the nation into quadrants of twelve states each and assigned Stevens to the eastern area, Mabel Vernon to the middle west, Anne Martin to the far west, and Maud Younger to the south. The regional organizers were tasked with educating groups about the suffrage bills that were in Congress and garnering support from each state for ratifying national suffrage. Rather than follow the previous strategy of achieving enfranchisement on a state-by-state basis, the Congressional Union Strategy was full federal approval. This issue, caused a rift in the suffrage movement at the 1913 Convention, causing Paul and her supporters to break ties with the NAWSA and become an independent organization.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the budgetary problems, the senior Italian navy commanders could not agree on {{the shape of the}} post-war Regia Marina. One faction advocated a traditional surface battle fleet, while a second believed a fleet composed of aircraft carriers, torpedo boats, and submarines would be ideal. A third faction, led by Admiral Sechi, argued that a balanced fleet with a core of battleships and carriers was the most flexible option. In order to secure budgetary space for new construction, Sechi drastically reduced the number of older ships in service; he also cancelled the battleships of the Francesco Caracciolo class. Francesco Caracciolo was sold on 25 October 1920 to the Navigazione Generale Italiana shipping company. The firm planned to convert her into a merchant ship, but the work was deemed too expensive, and <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> temporarily mothballed in Baia Bay outside Naples.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Falke {{had been}} sent to Liberia on 27 May in {{response}} to unrest in the country. She arrived in Monrovia on 9 June, and temporarily took Joseph James Cheeseman, the President of Liberia, aboard to protect him from the rebels. Falke wa back in Duala by 22 July. She was sent to Cape Town in South Africa for an overhaul that began on 30 November, but a rebellion among the Khoikhoi in German South-West Africa forced a postponement of the work; by 5 December the ship was in the colony to join the effort to suppress the rebels. Her presence proved to be unnecessary, and <b>so</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sent back to Cape Town later in the month. After she arrived, the Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff) transferred Falke to the colony in German New Guinea. Falke departed on 23 December, arriving in Melbourne via Sydney.|$|E
