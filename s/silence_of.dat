5|$|The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> the Lambs, a film {{adaptation}} of Harris' next Lecter novel, {{was released in}} 1991. However, none of the cast of Manhunter reprise their roles in the later film, although actors Frankie Faison and Dan Butler appear in both films as different and unrelated characters. The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> the Lambs earned several awards and accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. It {{is one of only}} three films to have won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Screenplay. The <b>Silence</b> <b>of</b> the Lambs was followed in turn by a sequel and two prequels: Hannibal, Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising, plus an NBC television series, Hannibal.|$|E

40|$|Conclusions In {{suspension}} {{cultures of}} tobacco BY- 2 cell line derived from calli after transformation about 90 % of lines contained cells with various GFP fluorescence level after transformation. Newly introduced cloning method allowed obtaining nearly 50 % of clones with homogeneous GFP expression from primarily heterogeneous BY- 2 lines. Heterogeneity of GFP expression in transgenic BY- 2 lines had two causes - genetic (primary lines contained cells with different T-DNA insertions) and epigenetic one. Epigenetic heterogeneity of BY- 2 lines was connected with transgene <b>silencing,</b> formation <b>of</b> stable epigenetic states early after transformation, and "permanent heterogeneity" with fluctuating levels in GFP expression. Reduction or <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> transgene expression in potato was predominantly observed in lines with {{higher number of}} T-DNA insertions and with higher initial GFP expression. Silencing in potato always gradually affected both introduced genes. <b>Silencing</b> <b>of</b> GFP expression preceded (in months) loss of resistance to kanamycin (<b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> NPTII gene) in all monitored cases that indicates interconnections between <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> both transgenes. The same sequence <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> both transgenes in potato was also observed in silenced lines after reactivation of transgene expression by 5 -azacytidine, which [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Protection of genomes against {{invasion}} by repetitive sequences, such as transposons, viruses, and repetitive transgenes, involves strong and selective <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> these sequences. During <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> repetitive transgenes, a trans effect (“cosuppression”) occurs {{that results in}} <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> cognate endogenous genes. Here we report RNA interference (RNAi) screens performed to catalog genes required for cosuppression in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline. We find factors with a putative role in chromatin remodeling and factors involved in RNAi. Together with molecular data also presented in this study, {{these results suggest that}} in C. elegans repetitive sequences trigger transcriptional gene silencing using RNAi and chromatin factors...|$|R
40|$|In Drosophila, {{heterochromatin}} causes mosaic <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> euchromatic genes brought {{next to it}} by chromosomal rearrangements. Silencing {{has been}} observed to "spread": genes closer to the heterochromatic rearrangement breakpoint are silenced more frequently than genes farther away. We have examined <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> the white and roughest genes in the variegating rearrangements In(1) w(m 4), In(1) w(mMc), and In(1) w(m 51 b). Eleven stocks bearing these chromosomes differ widely in the strength <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> white and roughest. Stock-specific differences in the relative frequencies of inactivation of white and roughest were found that map to the white-roughest region or the adjacent heterochromatin. Most stock-specific differences did not correlate with gross differences in the heterochromatic content of the rearranged chromosomes; however, two stocks, In(1) w(m 51 b) and In(1) w(mMc), {{were found to have}} anomalous additional heterochromatin that may act in trans to suppress variegating alleles. In comparing different stocks, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> the roughest gene, which is more distant from heterochromatin, does not correlate with the frequency <b>of</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> the more proximal white gene on the same chromosome, in contradiction to the expectation of models of continuous linear propagation <b>of</b> <b>silencing.</b> We frequently observed rough eye tissue that is pigmented, as though an active white gene is skipped...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Pancreatic ductal {{adenocarcinoma}} shows {{a distinct}} apoptosis resistance, which contributes {{significantly to the}} aggressive nature of this tumor and constrains the effectiveness of new therapeutic strategies. Apoptosis resistance {{is determined by the}} net balance of the cells pro-and anti-apoptotic "control mechanisms". Numerous dysregulated anti-apoptotic genes have been identified in pancreatic cancer and seem to contribute to the high anti-apoptotic buffering capacity. We aimed to compare the benefit <b>of</b> simultaneous gene <b>silencing</b> (SGS) <b>of</b> several candidate genes with conventional gene <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> single genes. Methods From literature search we identified the anti-apoptotic genes XIAP, Survivin and Bcl- 2 as commonly upregulated in pancreatic cancer. We performed SGS and <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> single candidate genes using siRNA molecules in two pancreatic cancer cell lines. Effectiveness of SGS was assessed by qRT-PCR and western blotting. Apoptosis induction was measured by flow cytometry and caspase activation. Results Simultaneous gene <b>silencing</b> reduced expression <b>of</b> the three target genes effectively. Compared to <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> a single target or control, SGS of these genes resulted in a significant higher induction of apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. Conclusions In the present study we performed a subliminal <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> different anti-apoptotic target genes simultaneously. Compared to <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> single target genes, SGS had a significant higher impact on apoptosis induction in pancreatic cancer cells. Thereby, we give further evidence for the concept of an anti-apoptotic buffering capacity of pancreatic cancer cells. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Akt/PKB serine/threonine {{protein kinase}} {{consists}} of three isoforms: Akt- 1, − 2 and − 3. Their overexpression has been detected in human cancers, but their roles in cancer progression are unclear. We investigated the impact <b>of</b> specific <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> Akt 1 and Akt 2 on human lung cancer cell proliferation, colony growth, motility, and invasion in vitro as well as tumor growth in vivo using human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer cells LNM 35, and on the vascular tube formation using HUVEC cells. Although <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> Akt 1 decreased cellular invasion {{at least in part}} via COX- 2 inhibition, it had almost no effect on cell motility, proliferation, colony formation, and angiogenesis. Transient as well as stable <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> Akt 2 resulted in a strong inhibition of Rb phosphorylation associated with a decrease in cellular proliferation and colony formation, leading to the inhibition of tumor growth in the xenograft model. <b>Silencing</b> <b>of</b> Akt 2 also reduced cellular motility and invasion in vitro, presumably via COX- 2 inhibition. Moreover, <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> Akt 2 in the HUVEC cells resulted in the inhibition of their spontaneous angiogenic phenotype.

5|$|Despite the {{low gross}} on its initial release, Manhunter grew in {{popularity}} by the 2000s {{and has been}} mentioned in several books and lists of cult films.

40|$|SummaryEpigenetic <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> tumor {{suppressor}} genes {{is generally}} thought to involve DNA cytosine methylation, covalent modifications of histones, and chromatin compaction. Here, {{we show that}} <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> the three transcription start sites in the bidirectional MLH 1 promoter CpG island in cancer cells involves distinct changes in nucleosomal occupancy. Three nucleosomes, almost completely absent from the start sites in normal cells, are present on the methylated and silenced promoter, suggesting that epigenetic silencing may be accomplished by the stable placement of nucleosomes into previously vacant positions. Activation of the promoter by demethylation with 5 -aza- 2 ′-deoxycytidine involves nucleosome eviction. Epigenetic <b>silencing</b> <b>of</b> tumor suppressor genes may involve heritable changes in nucleosome occupancy enabled by cytosine methylation...|$|R
