This can only be known after the project is completed. If, for example, a project estimate was $1,252,000 for a specific <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions,</b> and at completion the records showed that $1,172,451.26 was expended, the estimate was 6.8% too high. If the project ended up having a different scope or conditions, an unadjusted computation does not fairly assess the estimate accuracy. Predictions of the estimate accuracy may accompany the estimate. Typically this is expressed as a range higher or lower as compared with the point estimate with an expected probability that the actual cost will fall in the range. [...] An example for a definitive estimate might be that the estimate has a -5/+10% range of accuracy with a 90% confidence that the final value will fall in that range. The accuracy of an early estimate relates to the estimate quality. Factors affecting the quality of the estimate include the people who prepared the estimate, how the estimate was prepared, and what was known about the project. For the same project, the range of uncertainty about the total estimate decreases over time, as illustrated in the cone of uncertainty diagram.|$|E

In this article, we {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} “institutional accountability” to complement the wider literature(s) on accountability in climate governance. Within institutional frameworks, actors employ rules, norms, and procedures to demand justifications from one another. In light of those justifications, actors then use “exit, voice, or loyalty” to positively or negatively sanction each other. To depict the dynamics of institutional accountability, we analyze the role of nonstate actors in the nine constituency groups of the UNFCCC. We outline the constituency structure and the population of observer organizations. We then identify examples where nonstate actors employed institutional rules in tandem with exit, voice, or loyalty to foster accountability. In making this analysis we draw upon three years of on-site participation at UNFCCC meetings, document analysis, and more than 40 semi-structured interviews with state and nonstate actors. We conclude by discussing the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> under which institutional accountability may occur in other issue areas of global governance...|$|E

It comprises sectoral (or national) bargaining and a high union density that can force non-unionized employers into line. Unlike the former combination of sectoral bargaining-strong employer organization-extension arrangements, which hinges on state support, this second trajectory rests upon a continuing organizational capacity {{on the part of}} unions. Given the reality of union decline, he concludes that high coverage rates will continue to depend on public intervention or at least a non-reversal of policies of open or tacit support for collective bargaining. He is pessimistic on this score, noting the dramatic effects of changes in public policy in the UK and New Zealand and Australia, recent events in countries depending on international financial assistance (Greece, Portugal, and Ireland) that are stated to have had a cooling effect on collective bargaining, plus developments in the new EU member states (the Baltics, Poland, and Hungary) where weak unions tempt employers to abandon collective bargaining.|$|E

Considerations in this regard was carried out first based on the regulations Polish and Russian Criminal Code. The paper presents the diversity of solutions adopted in these legislation, both the statutory and judicial penalties.

In addition, it was found that both legislature agreed on the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> tightening and mitigation of punishment. The foregoing that the scope of the solutions adopted, without reference to the practical aspects their use in both countries, does not allow to say that the degree of repression of criminal law concerning the time residence of the offender in isolation is higher in Russia than in Poland.

Primarily owing to distributional concerns, state {{interference with the}} liberalised retail energy market is ever-present across many EU Member States, despite its implications {{for the development of}} competitive (national and EU) energy markets. Rather than solely engaging with the conditions of state intervention as such, this article takes a step back and argues that an appreciation of what constitutes a reasonable price for energy supply is a necessary prerequisite in determining the relevance, <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> of state intervention in retail energy prices. In the absence of a definition of the concept in secondary legislation, it offers a novel conceptual framework centred on the contextual interpretation of “a reasonable price for energy supply”. The article offers two understandings of reasonableness: one underpinned by the principle of market competition and the other understood as affordability. It elaborates on the different set of conditions and criteria against which they are judged and it explains how these have informed various instruments enshrined in the energy liberalisation directives for achieving reasonable prices for end-consumers. Its broader aim is to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of what is meant by a “reasonable retail energy price” within the context of national and EU competitive retail energy markets and explore how the resulting tension between the two understandings of reasonableness is accommodated in the broader EU constitutional and institutional context...|$|E

The objectives pursued by the author are:- establishing the juridical nature of consumer's right of withdrawal from e-contracts;- identification of problems that could arise from law’s interpretation,- issuing of the de lege ferenda proposals. Governmental Ordinance no. 130 / 2000 introduces a new exception to the principle of irrevocability of contracts in Romanian law: the consumer's right of withdrawal from distance contracts. The same Ordinance sets the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> for the applicability of this right. Consumer's right of withdrawal from e-contracts, as a type of distance contracts, can be exercised without the need to give any specific reason and without penalties, within 10 working days from the date of receiving the goods or from the another moment depending on the specifics set out in GO no. 130 / 2000. If consumer cancels the distance contract on the basis that he does not like the goods, the withdrawal from the contract is valid, even if the withdrawal solely depended on the will of the consumer, this sets out a legal exception from the provisions of art. 1010 of Civil Code which stipulate the nullity of the obligations undertook by the liable person under the condition “if I want”.

First, {{attempts were made to}} identify the lexical source of zeon 3 hang 4. Unlike most other progressives having a locative origin, it is argued that zeon 3 hang 4 came from a verb meaning ‘(be) in progress’, which makes it an atypical type of progressive marker. Secondly, the degree of grammaticalization of zeon 3 hang 4 was examined by finding out the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> of the use of the marker. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were involved. An acceptability judgment task, based on the model of Flecken (2011), was administered to explore the perceived constraints and preferences of zeon 3 hang 4 by the native speakers. A post-questionnaire interview was conducted on selected participants to understand their views on zeon 3 hang 4. In the judgment task, four hypotheses concerning temporal contexts, situations types, thematic roles and age groups were tested. Results show thatzeon 3 hang 4 is anchored mainly in here-and-now contexts and is most compatible in situations with dynamic predicates. Also, the thematic role of the subject is found to be the most determining variable for the adoption of zeon 3 hang 4, in which subject as patient is highly favorable for the marker. As for age-related differences, the middle group is discovered to be least likely to apply zeon 3 hang 4. In the interview, it is revealed that participants associated zeon 3 hang 4 with formal register. Moreover, subjects admitted that token frequency was crucial for affecting their attitudes towards the adoption of the marker in certain contexts. published_or_final_versionLinguisticsMasterMaster of Art...|$|E

The STP, managed for the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) by FH, was created to design and operate a process to eliminate uranium metal from the sludge prior to packaging for Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) by using high temperature liquid water to accelerate the reaction, produce uranium dioxide from the uranium metal, and safely discharge the hydrogen. The proposed testing builds on the approach and laboratory test findings for both K Basin sludge and simulated sludge garnered during prior testing from September 2006 to March 2007. The outlined testing in this plan is designed to yield further {{understanding of the nature of}} the chemical reactions, the effects of compositional and process variations and the effectiveness of various strategies to mitigate the observed high shear strength phenomenon observed during the prior testing.
