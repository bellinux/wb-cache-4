5|$|Similar to the {{previous}} season, Portland was overcome with injuries {{from the start of}} the 2010–11 season.

40|$|Heegaard Floer {{homology}} is combinatorially computable, but {{a convenient}} computational scheme {{in general is}} still missing, especially for HF^- of hyperbolic manifolds. We aim to use the Manolescu-Ozsváth the link surgery formula for computing Heegaard Floer homology of <b>surgeries</b> <b>on</b> links and finding applications <b>on</b> L-space <b>surgeries</b> <b>on</b> links. The main difficulty {{is to reduce the}} complexity of the algorithms. We give a polynomial time algorithm to compute the whole package of the completedHeegaard Floer homology HF^- of all <b>surgeries</b> <b>on</b> a two-bridge link of slope q/p, L=b(p,q), by using nice diagrams and some algebraic rigidity results to simplify the link surgery formula. We also initiate a general study of the definitions, properties, and examples of L-space links. In particular, we find many hyperbolic L-space links, including some chain links and two-bridge links; from them, we obtain many hyperbolic L-spaces by integral surgeries, including the Weeks manifold. We give bounds on the ranks of the link Floer homology of L-space links and on the coefficients in the multi-variable Alexander polynomials. We also describe the Floer homology of <b>surgeries</b> <b>on</b> any L-space link using the link surgery formula of Manolescu and Ozsváth. As applications, we compute the graded Heegaard Floer homology of <b>surgeries</b> <b>on</b> 2 -component L-space links in terms of only the Alexander polynomial and the surgery framing. We also give a fast algorithm to classify L-space surgeries among them...|$|R

40|$|How do Seifert <b>surgeries</b> <b>on</b> {{hyperbolic}} knots {{arise from}} those on torus knots? We approach this question from a networking viewpoint. The Seifert Surgery Network is a 1 -dimensional complex whose vertices correspond to Seifert surgeries; two vertices are connected by an edge if one Seifert surgery is {{obtained from the}} other by a single twist along a trivial knot called a seiferter or along an annulus cobounded by seiferters. Successive twists along a "hyperbolic seiferter" or a "hyperbolic annular pair" produce infinitely many Seifert <b>surgeries</b> <b>on</b> hyperbolic knots. In this paper, we investigate Seifert <b>surgeries</b> <b>on</b> torus knots which have hyperbolic seiferters or hyperbolic annular pairs, and obtain results suggesting that such surgeries are restricted.
