5|$|A wetland reserve {{has been}} created at Heron's Green Pool on the {{opposite}} side of the causeway to the lake. A shallow pool fringed with sedges (Cyperaceae), rushes (Juncaceae) and reedgrasses (Calamagrostis) and surrounded by lightly grazed, rough grassland may also prove attractive to <b>snipe</b> and lapwings.|$|E
5|$|Paley {{considers}} the equivalents of human anatomy in other animals. Human clothing {{is compared to}} the fur, feathers, quills and scales of animals. The structure of the feather is admired. The teeth and jaws of carnivores, herbivores and omnivores are considered. Similarly, the adaptations of birds' bills in species like the crossbill, spoonbill and (long-billed) <b>snipe</b> are discussed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Snipes</b> {{has been}} married twice, first to April <b>Snipes,</b> {{with whom he has}} a son Jelani, who had a cameo role in Snipes' 1990 film Mo' Better Blues. In 2003, <b>Snipes</b> married painter Nakyung [...] "Nikki" [...] Park, with whom he has four children.|$|R

50|$|During the case, {{investigators}} {{found that one}} of the trust funds belonged to actor Wesley <b>Snipes.</b> <b>Snipes</b> himself was indicted on tax charges in October 2006. <b>Snipes</b> was convicted of three misdemeanor counts of failing to file Federal income tax returns (and was acquitted on other tax charges).|$|R
5|$|Scolopacidae is a large, diverse {{family of}} small to {{medium-sized}} shorebirds including the sandpiper, curlew, godwit, shank, tattler, woodcock, <b>snipe,</b> dowitcher and phalarope. The {{majority of these}} species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Different lengths of legs and bills enable multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without directly competing for food.|$|E
5|$|BBRC reviews 1200 to 1500 records {{each year}} (when {{it was first}} set up, the figure was around 200 per year). Of these, {{approximately}} 85% are accepted: this acceptance rate has remained steady for many years. Species that have caused particular problems include black kite, great <b>snipe,</b> gyrfalcon, gull-billed tern, and North Atlantic little shearwater. Peter Grant estimated that, during his tenure as chairman, approximately 2% of accepted records are incorrectly accepted, and 5% are incorrectly rejected.|$|E
5|$|He {{was thankful}} to be posted to the No. 1 School of Aerial Fighting at Ayr in Scotland, where he flew the {{excellent}} performing Sopwith <b>Snipe.</b> It was in Scotland {{that he learned}} {{of the death of}} his brother, apparently shot down by the German ace Hans Wolff on 19 March. He wrote to his brother's commanding officer, Sholto Douglas asking for any news but understanding the Major's attention was now fixed on the German Spring Offensive. His death depressed McCudden greatly.|$|E
50|$|Hodges {{presided over}} the 2008 trial of celebrity actor Wesley <b>Snipes</b> for failure to file {{personal}} income tax returns (Not {{to be confused with}} tax evasion). <b>Snipes</b> was convicted on three misdemeanor charges, however Judge Hodges sentenced <b>Snipes</b> to three years in prison and an additional year of probation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{government}} also charged that <b>Snipes</b> failed to file tax returns {{for the years}} 1999 through 2004. <b>Snipes</b> responded to his indictment in a letter on December 4, 2006, declaring himself to be [...] "a non-resident alien" [...] of the United States; in reality, <b>Snipes</b> is a birthright U.S. citizen. <b>Snipes</b> said he was being made an example of and was unfairly targeted by prosecutors because of his fame {{in connection with the}} federal tax fraud investigation.|$|R
50|$|Renaldo <b>Snipes</b> (born Reenaold <b>Snipes</b> on August 15, 1956) is an American former boxer, {{best known}} for his title {{championship}} bout with Larry Holmes.|$|R
5|$|Spring {{migration}} is relatively quiet, although sightings of ring ouzel and firecrest are possible amongst {{the more common}} arrivals. Breeding birds include lapwings, common <b>snipe,</b> pied avocets, common redshanks and marsh harriers on the grazing marshes, ringed plovers and little terns on the beach, and black-headed, herring and lesser black-backed gulls on the salt marsh. The small grey heron colony has been joined by little egrets, and, from 2010, by Eurasian spoonbills. The pines may occasionally have nesting siskins or common crossbills, and parrot crossbills bred in 1984 and 1985.|$|E
5|$|The reserve's {{location}} {{means that}} migrants may be found, sometimes in huge numbers {{when the weather}} conditions are right. These may include vagrant rarities, including a western sandpiper in 2012, a displaying great <b>snipe</b> in 2011, a trumpeter finch in 2010 and a collared pratincole in 2009. In order to maintain a good habitat, parts of the reed bed are cut and sold for thatch each year to establish a mosaic of plants of different ages.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} August 1916, the {{division}} was deployed to the Ypres Salient where it remained {{for the next ten}} months seeing no major action. The division spent its time rebuilding and consolidating washed out trenches and raiding German positions. For the former, {{the division}} was commended by their Corps commander Rudolph Lambart (XIV Corps). In November, elements of the 14th Welsh launched a large raid on a German position known as High Command Redoubt, a fortified position on a slight rise that overlooked the British lines. From this redoubt, the Germans had been able to direct artillery fire and <b>snipe</b> the British positions. The 14th Welsh raided the position, killing 50 defenders in hand-to-hand combat and taking 20 more as prisoners.|$|E

5000|$|Nicknamed [...] "Mister" [...] <b>Snipes,</b> <b>Snipes</b> {{started off}} his career successfully, with a first-round {{knockout}} of Carl Halliburton. That fight {{was on the}} same card that future heavyweight contender James Tillis made his debut on. 21 more wins followed, and he challenged world heavyweight champion Larry Holmes for the title November 6, 1981 in Pittsburgh. <b>Snipes</b> knocked down the champion in the seventh round. However Holmes got up and <b>Snipes</b> was stopped in Round 11. <b>Snipes</b> complained that Holmes was the beneficiary of a long count. Films show, however, that the claim is exaggerated; Holmes rose at the count of 4 and though badly hurt, fought off the charging <b>Snipes</b> {{for the remainder of}} the round. <b>Snipes</b> fought a string of world-class fighters after the Holmes bout, in contests that mostly descended into wildly entertaining brawls. He amassed a record of 39 wins (22 by knockout), 8 losses, and 1 draw. In his career he fought boxers Trevor Berbick, Gerrie Coetzee, Tim Witherspoon, Greg Page, Eddie Mustafa Muhammad, Alfredo Evangelista, South African puncherJohnny DuPlooy and many more.|$|R
5000|$|Reportedly, series star Wesley <b>Snipes</b> {{was unhappy}} with the film's script and {{original}} choice of director. David S. Goyer, who had written all three films in the franchise, was then selected to replace the original director of the film, which <b>Snipes</b> protested. <b>Snipes</b> reportedly caused difficulty during filming, including frequently refusing to shoot scenes, often forcing director Goyer to use stand-ins and computer effects to add his character to scenes. Co-star Patton Oswalt alleged that <b>Snipes</b> would spend {{much of his time}} smoking marijuana in his trailer, and that he had become violent with Goyer after falsely accusing him of racism. It has also been alleged that <b>Snipes</b> refused to interact with Goyer or his co-stars, and would instead communicate with them through his assistant or the use of notes. <b>Snipes</b> also allegedly referred to co-star Ryan Reynolds as a [...] "cracker" [...] on one or more occasions.|$|R
5|$|Baker was {{promoted}} to temporary captain and made a flight commander in No.4 Squadron on 24 October. Two days later, Baker and Lieutenant Thomas Barkell led a formation of nine Snipes. As the patrol drew near Tournai in the afternoon, they intercepted a group of 15 Fokker D.VIIs. The Snipes swept towards the German aircraft, and Baker attempted to engage the formation leader, but the machine guns on his <b>Snipe</b> jammed. He brought in his aircraft for a second attempt, and managed to shoot the Fokker down out of control. In all, the Australians destroyed five of the Fokkers before the engagement ended.|$|E
5|$|Birds are hunted in many {{countries}} around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as mallard, wigeon, shoveler and teal have for centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, partridges, grouse, and <b>snipe</b> are among the terrestrial birds that are hunted for sport, generally with guns. In {{other parts of the}} world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional Māori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.|$|E
5|$|Each {{account is}} {{closed with a}} {{miniature}} woodcut known from {{its position in the}} text as a tail-piece. These small artworks depict aspects of country life, often with humorous subjects, but all with Bewick's eye for detail, style, and precision. Some add to the illustration of the bird in question, as for example the heron, where the tail-piece shows one heron catching an eel, and another flying away. The tail-piece for Sabine's <b>snipe,</b> a gamebird, shows a hunter firing, and a small bird falling to the ground. There is no exclusion of human life from the images: one tail-piece depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river.|$|E
50|$|Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is a {{tactical}} shooter that employs stealth, hand-to-hand assassinations and titular <b>sniping</b> techniques. Gameplay features realistic bullet physics that factors distance, wind, and bullet drop when <b>sniping</b> targets.|$|R
50|$|<b>Snipes</b> Mountain, itself, {{was named}} for Ben <b>Snipes,</b> an early Yakima County pioneer who built a house {{at the base of}} a {{mountain}} in the 1850s and developed an expansive cattle operation.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Snipes</b> Mountain AVA was {{established}} in 2009. At , {{it is one of}} Washington's smaller wine regions. The viticultural area is located on <b>Snipes</b> Mountain, a long anticline ridge that rises from the floor of the Lower Yakima Valley with comparatively unique, rocky soils, called aridisols. The viticultural area also includes Harrison Hill, which lies contiguously east of <b>Snipes</b> Mountain and has similar soil and topography.|$|R
5|$|Numerous {{other birds}} can be seen, {{especially}} during the spring and autumn migration. Sand martins (Riparia riparia) arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in {{the second or third}} week of March. Flocks of tits (Paridae), swallows (Hirundinidae) and terns (Sternidae) can regularly be seen. Waders, such as lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and common <b>snipe</b> (Gallinago gallinago), are attracted to the muddy shores if the water level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 gulls, mostly black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) and common gull (Larus canus), may be roosting. Good numbers of reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) and sedge warblers (A. schoenobaenus) nest in the fringing reeds, along with grebes (Podicipedidae) and Eurasian coots (Fulica atra).|$|E
5|$|On 8 November 1917, No. 2 Wireless School {{was formed}} at Penshurst. It {{operated}} {{a variety of}} aircraft, including Airco DH.6, Avro 504K, Avro 504N, Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c and B.E.2e, Sopwith Camel and Sopwith <b>Snipe.</b> Aircrew attended the school for a one-week-long course in wireless telephony procedures. The school was disbanded on 23 March 1919. Knotley Hall was offered for sale in May 1919. In September 1919, {{it was announced that}} Penshurst had been disposed of by the Royal Air Force, and that it could be considered as an emergency landing ground for civil aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{then moved}} to Switzerland, with the car chase being filmed at the small curves roads near Realp, {{the exterior of the}} Pilatus Aircraft factory in Stans serving as Goldfinger's factory, and Tilly Masterson's attempt to <b>snipe</b> Goldfinger being shot in the Furka Pass. Filming wrapped on 11 July at Andermatt, after nineteen weeks of shooting. Just three weeks prior to the film's release, Hamilton and a small team, which included Broccoli's stepson and future producer Michael G. Wilson as assistant director, went for last-minute shoots in Kentucky. Extra people were hired for post-production issues such as dubbing so the film could be finished in time.|$|E
40|$|Can <b>Sniping</b> in Internet Auctions be an Equilibrium Strategy? <b>Sniping</b> is {{a bidding}} {{behavior}} that involves placing a bid {{in the closing}} moments of a fixed end-time Internet auction such as those on eBay. Ockenfels and Roth (2006) show <b>sniping</b> {{can be one of}} multiple equilibria in eBay type auctions under both private and dependent value assumptions. In a departure from these findings, we show that <b>sniping</b> is not an equilibrium strategy for eBay type auctions in the private value case and we provide more stringent conditions under which it is an equilibrium strategy in the dependent value model...|$|R
5000|$|Wesley <b>Snipes</b> used Arnis in 2004s Blade: Trinity. Fight {{coordinator}} Chuck Jeffries is a Kali expert (under Dan Inosanto) and <b>Snipes</b> {{learned from}} Jeff Ward who was fight choreographer {{in the first}} 2 movies.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Snipes</b> Mountain AVA was {{established}} in 2009. At 4145 acre, {{it is one of}} Washington's smaller wine regions. The viticultural area is located on <b>Snipes</b> Mountain, a long anticline ridge that rises from the floor of the Lower Yakima Valley with comparatively unique, rocky soils, called aridisols. The viticultural area also includes Harrison Hill, which lies contiguously east of <b>Snipes</b> Mountain and has similar soil and topography.|$|R
5|$|Swans {{and geese}} usually start {{to arrive in}} late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, <b>snipe</b> and ruff.|$|E
5|$|The hill is {{blanketed}} in heather, {{which gives}} it a deep purple colour during the summer. Ling and bell heather, gorse, sessile oak, ash, rowan, hazel, bracken, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns all grow on the hill or in surrounding woodland, {{as well as some}} unique whitebeam species. Exmoor ponies, red deer, pied flycatchers, wood warblers, lesser spotted woodpeckers, redstarts, dippers, <b>snipe,</b> skylarks and kestrels are some of the fauna to be found on or around the hill and in nearby Horner Woods, home to 14 of the 16 UK bat species and including barbastelle and Bechstein's bats.|$|E
5|$|As of 2007, the {{following}} reviews are underway: {{a review of}} past records of Macaronesian shearwaters, reviews of all redhead and royal tern records, a review of great white egrets to establish if any are of the Nearctic race, a review of sandplovers, a review of records of the eastern race of redstart, a review of Orphean warbler records aimed at determining the race of each, and a review of subalpine warblers to determine which individuals are ascribable to the race albistriata. It has also been suggested that reviews should be conducted of records of great <b>snipe,</b> as older records show a very different temporal occurrence pattern than more recent birds, {{the large numbers of}} gull-billed tern records from the English south coast from the 1960s, and desert wheatears, to establish racial identifications.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the final}} fight, <b>Snipes</b> weighed only 178 points while Rhames was around 220 pounds. To mask the disparity, fight {{choreographer}} Cole McKay had <b>Snipes</b> fight upright and Rhames hunch {{forward in a}} crouching stance. For the final fight, <b>Snipes</b> said he and McKay would [...] "choreograph six or seven movements and then we'd improvise. We improvised the tail-end of each round, and that gave {{a certain amount of}} spontaneity and reality to it." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the movies}} Major League and Major League II, the center fielder for the Cleveland Indians is named Willie Mays Hayes. He was {{originally}} portrayed by a then-unknown Wesley <b>Snipes,</b> but Omar Epps replaced <b>Snipes</b> in the sequel.|$|R
50|$|Distribution {{rights were}} {{purchased}} by Miramax Pictures for a reported $4.5 million. There were press reports that Miramax head Harvey Weinstein wanted additional scenes reshot which made Wesley <b>Snipes</b> more sympathetic, but that <b>Snipes</b> {{refused to do}} them.|$|R
