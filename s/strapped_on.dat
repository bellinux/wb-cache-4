5|$|The Light Division {{tried to}} cut the German {{corridor}} by advancing {{to the west and}} linking up with a small ferry bridgehead over the Dortse Kil. However, two of the four battalions available were inefficiently deployed in a failed effort to recapture the suburbs of Dordrecht; when the other two battalions approached the main road, they were met head on by a few dozen German tanks. The vanguard of the Dutch troops, not having been informed of their presence, mistook the red air recognition cloths <b>strapped</b> <b>on</b> top of the German armour for orange flags French vehicles might use to indicate their friendly intentions—orange being seen by the Dutch as their national colour—and ran towards the vehicles to welcome them, only understanding their error when they were gunned down. The battalions, subsequently hit by a Stuka bombardment, fled to the east; a catastrophe was prevented by 47mm and 75mm batteries halting with direct AP fire the assault of the German tanks. The left wing of the Light Division despite the heavy losses then completed an ordered withdrawal to the Alblasserwaard at around 13:00. In the early afternoon eight tanks reduced the ferry bridgehead. A tank company also tried to capture the old inner city of Dordrecht without infantry support, audaciously breaching barricades, but was ordered to retreat after heavy street fighting in which at least two Panzerkampfwagen IIs were destroyed and three tanks heavily damaged. All Dutch troops were withdrawn from the island in the night.|$|E
5|$|The first {{prototype}} pylon {{was developed}} by Martin Jehart of Bellutti Protection Systems, an Austrian engineering firm specializing in the manufacturing of technical materials and tarpaulin. They initially used a latex balloon for crash tests and aerodynamic studies and after many tests and research settled {{on the use of}} a combination of different materials, the crucial component being spinnaker ripstop nylon, an extremely lightweight and flexible material used for making sails for boats. This would prove to be a breakthrough {{in the development of the}} Air Gates producing a pylon that would rip instantaneously when hit by a plane. Over 70 tests of the pylon were carried out on the ground using a car with a wing <b>strapped</b> <b>on</b> the roof before they were ready to undergo tests with a real plane. Eight different cars were used in these tests as well as a trailer and truck. Hungarian pilot, Péter Besenyei worked closely with the team and attempted the first deliberate pylon hit in early 2003 with positive results. The first Air Gates, which were cylindrical, were finally ready to be used at the very first Red Bull Air Races held in Austria and Hungary later that year.|$|E

(The slide rule in its holder <b>strapped</b> <b>on</b> the belt was a standard part of students’ uniform of the day.)

The attacking weapon apparently had a basket-guard protecting the hand, while the left forearm had a splint <b>strapped</b> <b>on</b> to serve as a shield. Soldiers fought with spears, large shields with an eye-hole, clubs, axes, poleaxes, flails, bows, slings, and swords of various forms.|$|E
25|$|Hebard was a {{tumbleweed}} of activity. Summers {{often found}} her bouncing along Wyoming's sagebrush rangeland, sometimes by horse and wagon {{and later by}} automobile, searching for Oregon Trail ruts or seeking to locate yet another historic site or pioneer to corner for an interview. Only after the High Plain's long winter had retreated would conditions become favorable for Hebard's expeditions. Although the record shows that she sometimes <b>strapped</b> <b>on</b> snowshoes to continue her explorations in the winter. But even summer treks presented difficulties. Thunder boomers easily turned the primitive tracks that then served as roads into impassable quagmires of Wyoming mud.|$|E
25|$|Suicide {{bombing was}} also used against the Japanese. A Chinese soldier detonated a grenade vest and killed 20 Japanese at Sihang Warehouse. Chinese troops {{strapped}} explosives like grenade packs or dynamite to their bodies and threw themselves under Japanese tanks to blow them up. This tactic was used during the Battle of Shanghai, where a Chinese suicide bomber stopped a Japanese tank column by exploding himself beneath the lead tank, and at the Battle of Taierzhuang where dynamite and grenades were <b>strapped</b> <b>on</b> by Chinese troops who rushed at Japanese tanks and blew themselves up. During one incident at Taierzhuang, Chinese suicide bombers destroyed four Japanese tanks with grenade bundles.|$|E

All of the War-Elephants were equipped with fire-hardened leather and quilted armor for protection while their foreheads and trunks bore steel-plates to defend against enemy arrows. The Pauravan Army itself was dressed in flamboyantly hued outfits wearing steel helmets, bright scarves and baldrics wielding axes, lances and maces. King Porus, seated atop the tallest War Elephant selected from his elephant corps, himself was not mounted on Howdah, as he wore a remarkable chain mail armor and hence had no need of the additional protection of a tower.|$|E

She was raised on a platform with a keytar over her shoulder as eight dancers in white bodysuits locked into steps below her. During the revamped Monster Ball shows, in 2010-11, Gaga wore a futuristic [...] "glitter ball suit", and started the performance by playing on a keyboard hidden inside {{the hood of a}} Rolls Royce. In May 2011, Gaga performed the song during Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria. She also made her debut performance on Irish TV screens performing Just Dance, on the Irish talk show Tubridy Tonight in January 2009.|$|E
500|$|The {{show had}} an expandable, five-platform stage which {{displayed}} the album's cover art. Madonna, wearing a skintight black {{suit and a}} lace top, appeared on the stage while sitting on a throne with a golden walking stick, as the music of [...] "Candy Shop" [...] started. Images of confectionery flashed on the television screens flanking {{the back of the}} stage. Madonna, along with her six dancers, gyrated in choreographed dance moves. Next, Madonna <b>strapped</b> <b>on</b> an acoustic guitar, took a swig from a champagne bottle and started singing [...] "Miles Away", as images of planes taking off and landing, airports and various locations around the globe were projected across the screens behind her. After that [...] "4 Minutes" [...] was performed, which mimicked its video with a flashing countdown clock. Then Madonna paused for a moment to thank her collaborators, including Timberlake, West, Timbaland and others. [...] "I feel like the luckiest girl in the world", she said, before dedicating the next song, [...] "Hung Up" [...] from 2005's Confessions on a Dance Floor, to her fans. The song was mixed with The Rolling Stones track [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". It was followed by [...] "Give It 2 Me", during which pink and green disco beams pulsated across the crowd. The show ended with a performance of [...] "Music" [...] (2000), during which her dancers emerged from a false, silver subway car door. Madonna danced across the stage, touching the hands of the audience and ended the show by racing up the stage to the subway doors, behind which she disappeared.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{returned}} for the Glam-Punk {{segment of the}} show and <b>strapped</b> <b>on</b> a guitar for rocked-out versions of [...] "I Love New York" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light".

[...] "Ray of Light" [...] was accompanied by her dancers in new wave style dance, while wearing black clothes and white ties. An energetic rendition of [...] "Let It Will Be" [...] followed before she sat down for some minutes {{to talk with her}} audience. She later started singing [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] without any choreography or backdrop video, only sitting on the floor, and then recalled co-singer Yitzhak Sinwani out for an acoustic version of [...] "Paradise (Not for Me)". The final segment Disco started after a brief radio-style mini-mix of old hits. Madonna emerged in a butterfly-collared suit influenced by John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever for a mash-up of [...] "Music" [...] and The Trammps' 1976 single [...] "Disco Inferno" [...] This also included a sample of her 1986 song [...] "Where's The Party" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} song while dancers rollerskated circles around her. Stuart Price's remixed dance version of [...] "Erotica", which sampled the song's original demo [...] "You Thrill Me", is performed. The next song was a Tropical-Dance version of [...] "La Isla Bonita", where the screens displayed clips of different beautiful islands, the sea and its fauna. This is followed by [...] "Lucky Star"; this dance re-invention of the song shared the same musical arrangement than the following and final song of the evening [...] "Hung Up", which is accompanied by a sing-along with the audience and confetti and golden balloons falling from above. The show ended as the phrase [...] "Have you confessed?" [...] appeared onscreen.|$|E
