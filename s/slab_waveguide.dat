40|$|The guided modal {{properties}} of double-positive and double-negative metamaterial <b>slab</b> <b>waveguides</b> are numerically analyzed and compared when varying the dielectric and magnetic constants. As the cutoff frequencies of both <b>slab</b> <b>waveguides</b> remained unchanged when {{the absolute value}} of the refractive index was kept invariant, this enabled an effective comparison of the respective guided modes. Thus, the guided mode dispersion characteristics of the double-positive and double-negative <b>slab</b> <b>waveguides</b> were analyzed and compared, including several higher order modes. As a result, this comparative analysis provides greater physical insights and {{a better understanding of}} the guided modal characteristics of double-negative metamaterial <b>slab</b> <b>waveguides...</b>|$|R

50|$|Light may be {{confined}} {{in the middle}} layer by total internal reflection. This occurs only if the dielectric index of the middle layer is larger {{than that of the}} surrounding layers. In practice slab waveguides are not infinite in the direction parallel to the interface, but if the typical size of the interfaces is much much larger than the depth of the layer, the <b>slab</b> <b>waveguide</b> model will be an excellent approximation. Guided modes of a <b>slab</b> <b>waveguide</b> cannot be excited by light incident from the top or bottom interfaces. Light must be injected with a lens from the side into the middle layer. Alternatively a coupling element may be used to couple light into the waveguide, such as a grating coupler or prism coupler.|$|E
50|$|The last element {{requisite}} to polaritonics is {{guidance and}} control. Complete lateral propagation {{parallel to the}} crystal plane is achieved by generating phonon-polaritons in crystals of thickness {{on the order of}} the phonon-polariton wavelength. This forces propagation to take place in {{one or more of the}} available <b>slab</b> <b>waveguide</b> modes. However, dispersion in these modes can be radically different from that in bulk propagation, and in order to exploit this, the dispersion must be understood.|$|E
40|$|The beam {{propagation}} method (BPM) is {{a powerful}} and manageable method {{for the analysis of}} wave propagation along weakly guiding optical waveguides. However, the effects of reflected waves are not considered in the original BPM. In this paper, we propose two simple modifications of the BPM to make it relevant in characterizing abrupt discontinuities in weakly guiding waveguides at which a significant amount of reflection is expected to be observed. Validity of the present modifications is confirmed by the numerical results for abrupt discontinuities in step-index <b>slab</b> <b>waveguides</b> and butt-joints between different <b>slab</b> <b>waveguides...</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{structure}} confines {{electromagnetic waves}} only in one direction, {{and therefore it}} has little practical application. Structures that may be approximated as <b>slab</b> <b>waveguides</b> do, however, sometimes occur as incidental structures in other devices.|$|R
40|$|Optical modes in {{anisotropic}} <b>slab</b> <b>waveguides</b> with topological and chiral magnetoelectric {{effects are}} investigated analytically, by deriving the closed-form characteristic equations of the modes and hence computing the dispersion-diagrams. In order {{to compute the}} characteristic equations, a vector-potential approach is introduced by incorporating a generalized Lorentz gauge, and the corresponding Helmholtz equations are derived correspondingly. It will be shown that {{the formation of the}} complex modes and hybridization of the optical modes in such <b>slab</b> <b>waveguides</b> is inevitable. Moreover, when the tensorial form of the permittivity in the waveguide allows for a hyperbolic dispersion, complex transition from the photonic kinds of modes to the plasmonic modes is expected.

50|$|A strip {{waveguide}} {{is basically}} a strip of the layer confined between cladding layers. The simplest case is a rectangular waveguide, which is formed when the guiding layer of the <b>slab</b> <b>waveguide</b> is restricted in both transverse directions rather than just one. Rectangular waveguides are used in integrated optical circuits and in laser diodes. They are commonly {{used as the basis}} of such optical components as Mach-Zehnder interferometers and wavelength division multiplexers. The cavities of laser diodes are frequently constructed as rectangular optical waveguides. Optical waveguides with rectangular geometry are produced by a variety of means, usually by a planar process.|$|E
50|$|Imageline, also {{image line}} or image guide, is a planar form of {{dielectric}} <b>slab</b> <b>waveguide.</b> It {{consists of a}} strip of dielectric, often alumina, on a metal sheet. In this format, there is no dielectric substrate extending in all horizontal directions, only the dielectric line. It is so called because the ground plane acts as a mirror resulting in a line that is equivalent to a dielectric slab without the ground plane of twice the height. It shows promise for use at the higher microwave frequencies, around 100 GHz, {{but it is still}} largely experimental. For instance Q factors in the thousands are theoretically possible but radiation from bends and losses in the dielectric-metal adhesive severely detract from this figure. A disadvantage of imageline is that the characteristic impedance is fixed at a single value of about 26 Ω.|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} realizing {{nanoantenna}} systems at optical frequencies is suggested wherein a plasmonic nanowire is placed near a <b>slab</b> <b>waveguide</b> operating near the plasmonic resonant {{frequency of the}} nanowire. The polarizability of a nano-sized concentric cylindrical structure with the core made of an ordinary dielectrics and the shell made of a plasmonic material is calculated using Mie scattering theory. When such a core-shell nanowire is placed near a <b>slab</b> <b>waveguide,</b> the transverse magnetic (TM) surface wave guided by the waveguide can interact with the nanowire, and thus part of its energy is scattered into the open space. By reciprocity, under TM wave incidence, the induced dipole on the nanowire will launch a guided mode in the <b>slab</b> <b>waveguide,</b> thus converting part of the incident energy into the guided mode energy. A rigorous analytical treatment of the problem using the Green function of a dipole near a planar <b>slab</b> <b>waveguide</b> is developed, and the properties of such an optical antenna system are studied in detail.

40|$|Radiation {{phenomena}} {{observed in}} a wedge shape ended dielectric <b>slab</b> <b>waveguide</b> are analyzed using mode matching technique. The case of transverse electric polarization (TE) being parallel to dielectric <b>slab</b> <b>waveguide</b> is assumed. In order to describe the fields in the wedge region, a stack of dielectric plates is assumed and in each layer the fields are expanded {{in terms of the}} mixed spectrum of guided and radiated modes. A similar expansion is used in the constant thickness <b>slab</b> <b>waveguide</b> while in free space medium a continuous-radiation mode expansion is used. Then a mode matching approach is applied, incorporating the orthogonality properties of mixed spectrum modes, in order to compute the wave fields inside the dielectric <b>slab</b> <b>waveguide</b> and wedge medium. Mode matching is achieved by discretizing the continuous radiation mode spectrum leading into a numerically stable solution provided a sufficient large number of points are used to convert integrals into finite summations.

40|$|The pulse {{propagation}} in a non-linear <b>slab</b> <b>waveguide</b> of parabolic {{index of refraction}} is treated by using differential equation techniques. A graded index dielectric <b>slab</b> <b>waveguide</b> free of material dispersion with a cubic order non-linearity is considered.
