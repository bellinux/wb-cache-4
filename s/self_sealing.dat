Total weight was 10.6 metric tonnes (9.8 tonnes without fuel and ammunition). The bottom module carried on each side an independently sprung front wheel, two bogies and the driving sprocket at the extreme front. The final drive and differentials were housed at the right in the nose module. It was steered through a Cletrac differential with five gears and by engaging the brakes.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to improve a paraffin actuated micropump design, {{to be able to}} pump against extreme pressures (above 100 bar). This was accomplished by initially studying the membrane activation, using video capturing. The micropump has been improved to withstand pressures high enough, to enable use in an high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The micropump has been shown to pump against back pressures up to 150 bar, with a positive net-flow. This should be compared with the previously recorded maximum back pressure of 50 bar. The pumping against high back pressures was possible due to an increased understanding of the sealing of the membranes. This resulted in a new design that was manufactured and characterised. Without clamping the pump was measured to manage back pressures of 10 bar, and then starting to leak in a bond at the flow channel. With supporting clamping, the managed back pressures increased ten folded. When measured on the different valves, pressure above 200 bar has been possible to withhold. Although the valves were below their maximum limit, the pressure was not possible to be further increased due to a limitation in the equipment, i. e. risk of damaging the connections. When examined after pressurised at extreme pressures (above 100 bar) several times, no signs of fatigue or damage of the membrane was seen. A new behaviour of the valves was discovered. Above certain pressures some designs <b>self</b> <b>sealed,</b> i. e. withholding the pressure after the voltage was turned off. For these valves the pressure had to be released by some other means...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that there are large sources of low grade heat from which power can be {{recovered}} by means of two-phase expansion processes. Hitherto proposals to do so have rarely been economically viable either due to the low adiabatic efficiencies of the expanders or their relatively high manufacturing cost. This paper describes the results of a long term R and D programme carried out at City University, London, which has resulted in the development of twin screw machines of great simplicity which can expand two-phase fluids with adiabatic efficiencies of more than 70 % and are cheap to produce. Two applications are given for these. The first is in a high efficiency system for the recovery of power from low temperature sensible heat sources, such as liquid geothermal brines. The second is to replace throttle valves in large refrigeration vapour compression systems. Here a device is being developed which recovers power from the two-phase expansion process and recompresses part of the vapour thus formed in a <b>self</b> driven <b>sealed</b> unit containing only a single pair of rotors. The authors have called this an “expressor”. Details are given of both analytical and experimental work on both expander and expressor units...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} {{the effect of}} the {{temperature}} increase on the hydro-mechanical properties of sheared Boom clay samples is investigated. Two samples of Boom clay are resaturated in a new hollow cylinder triaxial cell with a short drainage path and then sheared by performing an axisymmetric triaxial loading. The effect of the undrained heating under deviatoric stress is studied on the first sample. It is shown that undrained temperature increase leads to an increase of pore water pressure and consequently to a decrease of the effective mean stress which brings the sample to failure. For an initially sheared sample, the failure occurs along the existing shear band which behaves as a weakness plane in the sample. The responses of the local strain measurement transducers clearly show the sliding of rigid blocks when failure occurs in the sample. The effect of the presence of a shear band on the permeability of the other Boom clay sample is investigated at ambient temperature andat 80 °C. It is shownthat the presence of a shear band does not affect significantly the permeability. These results confirm the good <b>self</b> <b>sealing</b> properties of Boom clay at ambient and at high temperature...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Bouillante {{geothermal}} field provides about 8 % {{of the annual}} electricity needs of the French West Indies island of Guadeloupe. It {{has been the subject}} of several studies covering various disciplines. A hydrogeological conceptual model of the field is proposed. The reservoir consists of two perpendicular sets of fractures and faults, related to major regional tectonic structures, which have been clogged near surface by <b>self</b> <b>sealing.</b> The heat exchanges of the reservoir with the outside are reduced, through thermal and hydraulic blanketing, to conductive transfers. Convection cells are active within the reservoir, ensuring its thermal and geochemical homogeneity. Heat exchange with the magmatic chamber is only conductive. The Na-Cl geothermal fluid in the reservoir is composed of 60 % sea water and 40 % fresh water and has reached a chemical equilibrium with a mineralogical assemblage at 250 - 260 °C. Many arguments (equilibrium state, absence of tritium, low in/out fluxes, large reservoir volume) suggest a long residence time (> 100 years) of the geothermal fluid. Three factors explain the existence and location of the {{geothermal field}}: a heat source (cooling hypovolcanic intrusion), a network of permeable fractures at the origin of the geothermal aquifer, and an impermeable surface cover, limiting the loss of energy and ensuring the sustainability of the field...|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} open mask system incorporating an en face air jet to dry {{the target}} area during ablation and a conjunctival plication mechanism, which allows ab externo {{delivery of the}} 193 nm excimer laser without prior conjunctival dissection, has been developed to form small bore sclerostomies accurately and atraumatically. Full thickness sclerostomies, and sclerostomies guarded by a smaller internal ostium can be created. A pilot therapeutic trial was conducted in pseudophakic patients with advanced open angle glaucoma. Six full thickness sclerostomies (200 microns and 400 microns diameter) and three guarded sclerostomies were created in nine patients by 193 nm excimer laser ablation (fluence per pulse 400 mJ/cm 2, pulse rate 16 Hz, air jet pressure intraocular pressure + 25 mm Hg). After 6 months' follow up, intraocular pressure was controlled (< or = 16 mm Hg) in eight of the nine patients (6 / 9 without medication). Early postoperative complications included hyphaema (trace [...] 2. 5 mm) (6 / 9), temporary fibrinous sclerostomy occlusion (4 / 9), profound early hypotony (all patients without fibrinous occlusion), and suprachoroidal haemorrhage in one case.

40|$|Purpose In-the-bag {{posterior}} chamber intraocular lens (PC-IOL) dislocation {{is an unusual}} late complication of cataract surgery that can be managed either by exchange with a scleral fi xated intraocular lens or by PC-IOL repositioning with scleral fi xation. In the presence of mild subluxation, in older patients, we prefer to suture the fi brotic capsular bag to the sclera without opening the anterior chamber. Methods 5 patients (mean age 80 y. o.) who had uncomplicated phacoemulsifi cation with implantation of a {{posterior chamber}} intraocular lens (IOL) into the continuous capsulorhexis several years before (4 - 12 years), suff ered from PC-IOL subluxation secondary to dehiscence of the zonules supporting the capsular bag.

40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} {{the changes in}} Preoperative and Postoperative keratometry results and rapid visual rehabilitation in Cataract surgery by our phaco-sandwich technique through the <b>self</b> <b>sealing</b> sclero-corneal tunnel incision without phacoemulsification. Methods: 96 eyes of 88 patients with age-related cataracts underwent small incision suture less cataract surgery without phacoemulsification. All eyes were operated by the phaco-sandwich technique through sclerocorneal tunnel with 6 mm frown-shaped external scleral incision. 6 mm single piece PMMA lens was implanted in the capsular bag. Patients were evaluated at 1 week, 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-operatively. Results: Ninety six eyes of eighty eight patients were our cohort. During the first post-operative week 8 eyes (8. 3 %) had uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 6 / 6. By the end of 12 post-operative weeks, 33 eyes(34. 5 %) had UCVA of 6 / 6. 64 (66. 7 %), 72 (75 %) and 80 (83. 3 %) eyes had best correctable visual acuity (BCVA) of 6 / 6 after 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks respectively. 64 (66. 7 %) eyes after 4 weeks, 72 (75 %) after 8 weeks and 80 (83 %) after 12 weeks had best correctable visual acuity (BCVA) of 6 / 6.
