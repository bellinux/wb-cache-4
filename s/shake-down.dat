The ship arrived on 31 July, and departed again four days later with the convoy Hi-70. The convoy consisted of eight transports, headed for Moji; Shin'yō was joined by a pair of light cruisers and several smaller craft. The convoy arrived on 15 August, while Shin'yō put in at Kure the following day.|$|E

There was a bowl on the floor, the chair where it belonged being occupied. There was a very inhospitable looking bed, two <b>shake-downs,</b> and four Windsor chairs in more or less state of dilapidation--all occupied likewise. A country glass lamp was balanced on a rough shelf, and under it a young man sat absorbed in making notes, and apparently oblivious to the noise around him. Every gentleman in the room was collarless, coatless, tieless, and vestless. Some were engaged in fighting gnats and June bugs, while others battled with mosquitoes--all save the young man who wrote, he being wholly indifferent.|$|R
2500|$|Mrs Williams is Aubrey's mother-in-law. [...] In HMS Surprise, Maturin {{describes}} her as [...] "a deeply stupid, griping, illiberal, avid, tenacious, pinchfist, a sordid lickpenny and a shrew". It {{is hard to}} see any likeness of the mother in the daughter. Despite being stingy and obsessed with money, she is quite credulous and snobbish, which leads her to get involved in, for example, an illegal bookmaking operation, where she loses a great deal of her fortune and is threatened with arrest. When Aubrey is flush with funds after returning from The Mauritius Command, he takes care of her debts, so she again owns Mapes Court free and clear, but she prefers to lease it out and live with Sophia and her grandchildren at Ashgrove Cottage. Her harsh ways drive servants away until Aubrey staffs his household with seamen who are immune to her words, and keep up the house as they would a ship. When Aubrey is found guilty in a fraud on the stock exchange (in The Reverse of the Medal), then makes a fortune in prizes on the <b>shake-down</b> cruise of Surprise as a letter of marque (in The Letter of Marque), she is pleased, but believes him guilty as charged, and would do the same herself if she had the chance, as one must always guard one's capital. Mrs Williams dies in an accident when the coach in which she is riding, driven by her niece Diana Villiers-Maturin, overturns.|$|E

6000|$|Nothing {{could be}} kinder than Dome Colombeau, the priest of Nissard. He saw {{to the whole}} of his guests being put {{into some sort of}} dry habiliments before they sat round his table to eat of the savoury mess in the great pot-au-feu, which had, since their arrival, {{received}} additional ingredients, and moreover sundry villagers had crept into the house. Whenever the good Father supped at home, any of his flock were welcome to drop in to enjoy his hospitability. After a cup of hot cider round, they carried off the fisherman to ledge in one of their cottages. <b>Shake-downs</b> were found for the others, and Philip, wondering what was to become of the good host himself, gathered that he meant to spend such part of the night on the kitchen floor as he did not pass in prayer in the church for the poor young gentleman, who was in such affliction. Philip was not certain whether to resent this as an impertinence or an attack on their Protestant principles; but he was not sure, either, that the priest was aware what was their religion, and was still less certain of his own comprehension of these pious intentions: he decided that, any way, it was better not to make a fool of himself. Still, the notion of the mischievousness of priests was so rooted in his head, that he consulted Humfrey on the expedience of keeping watch all night, but was sagaciously answered that 'these French rogues don't do any hurt unless they be brought up to it, and the place was as safe as old Hurst.' ...|$|R

6000|$|The Royal Party, quitting Ludwigsburg,--on Thursday, 3d August, 1730, some {{hours after}} dinner, as I {{calculate}} it,--had but a rather short journey before them: journey {{to a place}} called Sinzheim, some fifty or sixty miles; a long way short of Heidelberg; the King's purpose being to lodge in that dilapidated silent Town of Sinzheim, and leave both Heidelberg and Mannheim, with their civic noises, for the next day's work. Sinzheim, such was the program, as the Prince and others understood it; but by some accident, or on better calculation, it was otherwise decided in the royal mind: not at Sinzheim, intricate decayed old Town, shall we lodge to-night, but five or six miles short of it, in the naturally silent Village of Steinfurth, where good clean empty Barns are to be found. Which latter is a favorite method of his Majesty, fond always of free air {{and the absence of}} fuss. <b>Shake-downs,</b> a temporary cooking apparatus, plenty of tobacco, and a tub to wash in: this is what man requires, and this without difficulty can be got. His Majesty's tastes are simple; simple, and yet good and human.

Then papa began to get very tired of Jones, and fidgeted and finally said, with jocular irony, that Jones had better stay all night, they could give him a <b>shake-down.</b> Jones mistook his meaning and thanked him with tears in his eyes, and papa put Jones to bed in the spare room and cursed him heartily.|$|E

6000|$|So unused was Uphill to {{the visits}} of ladies, {{that when the}} piece of French paper was sold to Judith, no one had thought of her being sought out in her bedroom. Molly came home with the {{children}} in the evening, tired out but excited--for all had had rather more beer than was good for them, and the children a great many more sweets. Jem and Judy were quarrelling over a wooden horse covered with white spots, but whose mane had already disappeared, Lizzie was sick, cross, and stupid, Polly had broken the string of her new yellow necklace, and was crying about it, and nobody had recollected the aunt except Johnnie, who presented her with a piece of thin gingerbread representing King George the Fourth, in white, pink, and gilt! Molly herself was very tired, though she said it was all very fine, and she had seen a lot of people, and the big sleeves they wore were quite a wonder. Then she scolded Polly with all her might for crying and never setting the tea, nor boiling the kettle; and, after all, it was Johnnie who made up the fire, fetched water, and set the kettle boiling. They all wrangled together over their purchases, and the sights they had seen, or not seen, while Judith was glad {{to be out of the}} way of seeing, though not of hearing. Then the girls trailed themselves upstairs. Judy slept with her aunt, Polly and Lizzie had a kind of <b>shake-down</b> on a mattress of chaff or hulls, as she called it, by her side.

60|$|I {{woke up to}} a great {{noise of}} feet, a sudden influx of people through {{the doors of the}} platform. I made out my man’s {{whiskers}} at once—not that they were enormous, but because I had been warned beforehand of their existence by the excellent Commissary General. At first I saw nothing of him but his whiskers: they were black and cut somewhat {{in the shape of a}} shark’s fin and so very fine that the least breath of air animated them into a sort of playful restlessness. The man’s shoulders were hunched up and when he had made his way clear of the throng of passengers I perceived him as an unhappy and shivery being. Obviously he didn’t expect to be met, because when I murmured an enquiring, “Señor Ortega?” into his ear he swerved away from me and nearly dropped a little handbag he was carrying. His complexion was uniformly pale, his mouth was red, but not engaging. His social status was not very definite. He was wearing a dark blue overcoat of no particular cut, his aspect had no relief; yet those restless side-whiskers flanking his red mouth and the suspicious expression of his black eyes made him noticeable. This I regretted the more because I caught sight of two skulking fellows, looking very much like policemen in plain clothes, watching us from a corner of the great hall. I hurried my man into a fiacre. He had been travelling from early morning on cross-country lines and after we got on terms a little confessed to being very hungry and cold. His red lips trembled and I noted an underhand, cynical curiosity when he had occasion to raise his eyes to my face. I was in some doubt how to dispose of him but as we rolled on at a jog trot I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do would be to organize for him a <b>shake-down</b> in the studio. Obscure lodging houses are precisely the places most looked after by the police, and even the best hotels are bound to keep a register of arrivals. I was very anxious that nothing should stop his projected mission of courier to headquarters. As we passed various street corners where the mistral blast struck at us fiercely I could feel him shivering by my side. However, Therese would have lighted the iron stove in the studio before retiring for the night, and, anyway, I would have to turn her out to make up a bed on the couch. Service of the King! I must say that she was amiable and didn’t seem to mind anything one asked her to do. Thus while the fellow slumbered on the divan I would sit upstairs in my room setting down on paper those great words of passion and sorrow that seethed in my brain and even must have forced themselves in murmurs on to my lips, because the man by my side suddenly asked me: “What did you say?”—“Nothing,” I answered, very much surprised. In the shifting light of the street lamps he looked the picture of bodily misery with his chattering teeth and his whiskers blown back flat over his ears. But somehow he didn’t arouse my compassion. He was swearing to himself, in French and Spanish, and I tried to soothe him by the assurance that we had not much farther to go. “I am starving,” he remarked acidly, and I felt a little compunction. Clearly, the first thing to do was to feed him. We were then entering the Cannebière and as I didn’t care to show myself with him in the fashionable restaurant where a new face (and such a face, too) would be remarked, I pulled up the fiacre at the door of the Maison Dorée. That was more of a place of general resort where, in the multitude of casual patrons, he would pass unnoticed.|$|E

A sprain of the [...] leg, and {{contusion}} (or confusion) of the head, are {{the extent of the}} [...] damage received, and you will say that it is cheap, considering all [...] things. I had done my 203 miles of marking, and was coming back on [...] my last day's journey, debating whether to push on to Lakeville that [...] night, camp out, or get a <b>shake-down</b> at Randolf's, bringing my own [...] provender, for they live on hominy and milk, except for what he can [...] shoot or catch. It was so dark that I had nearly fixed on sleeping [...] in the bush, when it struck me that there must be an uncommonly fine [...] aurora, but getting up a little rising ground where the trees were [...] thinner, I observed it was to the south-west, not the north. That [...] way there lies prairie land, at this season one ocean of dry bents, [...] fit to burn like tinder, so that one spark would set fifty square [...] miles alight at once. All the sky in that quarter was the colour of [...] glowing copper, but the distance was so enormous that danger never [...] occurred to me till I saw the deer scampering headlong, the birds [...] awake and flying, and my horse trembling and wild to be off.

I never [...] knew my beast's pace on the Kingston road what it was through that [...] track, all the rustling and scuttling of the beasts and birds [...] sounding round us, the glare gaining on us, and the scent of smoke [...] beginning to taint the wind. There was Randolf's clearing at last, [...] lonesome and still as ever, and a light in the window. Never was it [...] so hard to pull in a horse; however, I did so.

Randolf took his [...] axe, and pocketed a book or two, and we dashed off together for a [...] long arm of swamp that he knew of, running out from the lake. When [...] we got to the other end of the clearing, I thought it was all up with [...] us. The wall of red roaring flame had reached the other side, and [...] the flame was leaping from the top of one pine to another, making [...] them one shape of quivering red, like Christmas evergreens in the [...] fire, a huge tree perhaps standing up all black against the lurid [...] light, another crashing down like thunder, the ribbon of flame [...] darting up like a demon, the whole at once standing forth a sheet of [...] blazing light. I verily believe I should have stood on, fascinated [...] with the horror and majesty of the sight, and feeling it vain to try [...] to escape, when the burning wings were spreading to enclose the [...] clearing and us with it, but Randolf urged me on, and we plunged [...] through the bush at the best speed we could make, the smoke rolling [...] after us, and the heat glowing like a furnace, so as to consume all [...] power out of us. It was hell itself pursuing after us, and roaring [...] for his prey, the trees coming crashing down, and shaking the earth [...] under our feet, the flame absolutely running on before us upon the [...] dry grass and scrub, and the scorching withering every drop of [...] moisture from us, though not ten minutes before, we had been [...] streaming at every pore.|$|E
