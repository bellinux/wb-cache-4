40|$|During {{the last}} two decades many {{countries}} have liberalised their financial markets. They have attempted to eliminate government intervention in setting interest rate ceilings, erecting entry barriers, interfering in credit allocation decisions, and have begun to privatise their financial institutions (FIs). However, recent banking crises have indicated a link between liberalisation and financial fragility and the subsequent trade-off between the benefits of liberalisation and the costs of increasing financial fragility in developing markets. Recent experiences in Asia have highlighted the importance of the soundness of domestic financial systems especially the need for a prudential regulatory, supervisory, and accounting framework before undertaking financial sector liberalisation. The object of the paper is to provide a link between the relative level of an individual bank's adequacy and its effects on the fragility of the banking system. Specifically, the probability of a banking crisis is modelled using the characteristics of individual banks - namely, their capital adequacy ratios. The paper concentrates on the importance of distinguishing between cosmetic and effective changes to capital adequacy ratios to avoid the systemic threats which can grow out of microeconomic weaknesses in domestic banking systems as witnessed in Asia. capital adequacy, banking <b>standards,</b> <b>financial</b> <b>regulation...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{construction}} project should be administrated systematically {{from its inception}} for successful completion. When a Contractor or a Consultant is selected for a Civil Engineering Project, standard tender procedures are to be followed. When obtaining services for a project an agreement is signed by the Client and the Contractor. This agreement spells out the conditions of contract covering the contract administration requirements. There are standard contracts available so that the parties can use them effectively, easily and efficiently for better results. In Sri Lanka, when public finance is utilised, the <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulations</b> have to be followed in formulating a project. <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulations</b> specify the authority, limits and procedures to be followed when a project is financed by government money. In certain instances <b>standard</b> procedures and <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulations</b> contradict each other thus leading to ambiguity which adversely affect the successful completion of the project. Therefore reviewing of both <b>standard</b> procedures and <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulations</b> {{for the purpose of}} eliminating these differences is of high priority. This research has studied the available Standard Tender Procurement Procedures and Contract Conditions, and has established relevant procedures in tendering and contract administration with due consideration to the practical applications and problems. The research also has identified the <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulations</b> available for the relevant procedures and has established and compared the consistency of <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulations</b> against the established procedures.

In this context, the paper proposes a global licensing scheme for international investment funds and the reform of the Basle Capital Adequacy Standards.

50|$|Under Protocol 3, Jersey {{is part of}} the European Union Customs Union of the European Community. The common customs tariff, levies {{and other}} {{agricultural}} import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States.

Nor is Jersey part of the single market in financial services. It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, company law or money laundering.

40|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>regulation</b> {{in sports}} is usually {{discussed}} {{in the context of}} representing an instrument against "financial doping". Notwithstanding the merits of this discussion, this paper takes the opposite perspective and analyses how market-internal <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> itself may anticompetitively influence sporting results. Virtually every regulative financial intervention distorts sporting competition to some extent and creates beneficiaries and losers. Sometimes, the actual winners and losers of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> stand in line with the (legitimate) goals of the <b>regulation</b> like limiting <b>financial</b> imbalances or preventing distortive midseason insolvencies of teams. However, <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> may also display unintended side-effects like protecting hitherto successful teams from new challengers, cementing the competitive order, creating foreclosure and entry barriers, or serving vested interests of powerful parties. All of these effects may also be hidden agendas by those who are implementing and enforcing market-internal <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> or influencing it. This paper analyses various types of budget caps (including salary caps) with respect to potentially anticompetitive effects. UEFA's so-called <b>Financial</b> Fair Play <b>Regulations</b> are highlighted as an example. Furthermore, the paper discusses allocation schemes of common revenues (like from the collective sale of broadcasting rights) as another area of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> with potentially anticompetitive effects.

The results also indicate that good public sector governance amplifies the impact of regulatory governance on financial system soundness.

40|$|This thesis {{explains}} how China’s banking system has evolved since {{the establishment of}} the socialist market economy in 1993, when the state began to develop a more standardised and robust system of banking regulation and commercialise China’s state-owned banks. China’s large state-owned banks, which were technically insolvent in the 1990 s, are now some of the biggest commercial banks in the world. There has been a remarkable transformation of systems of governance and risk management across all types of banking institutions. China has developed a system of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> characterised by close supervision and strong <b>regulation</b> of <b>financial</b> institutions to mitigate risk and ensure the banking system serves the real economy. This thesis has relied on qualitative research to understand this change. Interviews of a number of past and present stakeholders in China’s banking system were undertaken, including officials from the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the agency responsible for the regulation and supervision of China’s banking system since 2003. The thesis also makes use of Chinese language texts which provide the views of Chinese political leaders and banking officials with respect to reform of the banking sector. The principal conclusion of the thesis is that the development of China’s banking system can best be understood as an evolution of institutions which reflect historical patterns of political and economic organisation in China. This finding is in contrast with the main body of academic literature which evaluates the development of China’s banking system according to its degree of conformance with a neoliberal economic system. The thesis argues that policy for China’s banking sector was conceived and implemented by officials through a politically united, centrally controlled bureaucracy reflective of China’s bureaucratic tradition. China’s leaders applied the concept of ‘Chinese studies at the base, Western studies for practical use’ (中體西用zhongti xiyong), when adapting Western ideas and technology within China’s traditional political and economic system to modernise the banking sector. The deep concern of officials for financial stability caused them to gradually and pragmatically adopt international <b>standards</b> of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> and resist policies of financial liberalisation and deregulation which were advocated by self-interested Western-educated bankers and government officials...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the impact of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> on economic growth in developing countries. The study was undertaken by formulating one overall research question, which was supported by two hypotheses. The study employed quantitative methodology to analyse the data. Secondary data was collected on a sample of ten developing countries in three regions (Africa, Americas and Asia Pacific). Time series data was obtained on the following variables: gross domestic products, inflation rate, interest rate, unemployment rate and financial freedom index. The data was initially analysed using trend analysis, which was followed by regression analysis. Trend analysis indicates that <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> is good for economic growth in developing countries. <b>Financial</b> <b>regulation</b> was measured by the financial freedom index and economic growth was measured by growth in gross domestic products. The results show a negative correlation between the two variables. When strict <b>financial</b> <b>regulations</b> are imposed, growth in gross domestic product increases. This relationship was tested statistically to quantify the percentage of change in gross domestic product attributable to <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> as well as its significance.

40|$|Book synopsis: The {{financial}} {{system and its}} regulation have undergone exponential growth and dramatic reform over the last thirty years. This period has witnessed major developments in the nature and intensity of financial markets, as well as repeated cycles of regulatory reform and development, often linked to crisis conditions. The recent financial crisis has led to unparalleled interest in <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> from policymakers, economists, legal practitioners, and the academic community, and has prompted large-scale regulatory reform. The Oxford Handbook of <b>Financial</b> <b>Regulation</b> is the first comprehensive, authoritative, and state-of-the-art account {{of the nature of}} <b>financial</b> <b>regulation.</b> Written by an international team of leading scholars in the field, it takes a contextual and comparative approach to examine scholarly, policy, and regulatory developments in the past three decades. The first three Parts of the Handbook address the underpinning horizontal themes which arise in financial regulation: {{financial system}}s and regulation; the organization of <b>financial</b> system <b>regulation,</b> including regional examples from the EU and the US; and the delivery of outcomes and regulatory techniques. The final three Parts address the major reoccurring objectives of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation,</b> widely regarded as the anchors of <b>financial</b> <b>regulation</b> internationally: <b>financial</b> stability; market efficiency, integrity, and transparency; and consumer protection.
