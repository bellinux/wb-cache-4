50|$|Schweinfurt Hauptbahnhof is {{the largest}} railway station in the Lower Franconian city of Schweinfurt and its {{transfer}} hub {{to the majority of}} regional buses. In addition to the Hauptbahnhof, the Schweinfurt Mitte (Schweinfurt Central) and Schweinfurt <b>Stadt</b> (<b>Schweinfurt</b> Town) stations also lie within the city, closer to the centre, on the Bamberg-Würzburg railway.|$|E
50|$|<b>Schweinfurt</b> <b>Stadt</b> (German for <b>Schweinfurt</b> Town) is {{a railway}} {{station in the}} Lower Franconian city of Schweinfurt, Germany. It is {{situated}} east of the old town, on the Bamberg to Würzburg line.|$|R

50|$|Lines 40 and 50 {{are called}} the Unterfranken Shuttle. Line 40 on the Schweinfurt-Meiningen railway, serves Schweinfurt and Meiningen, Line 50 on the Franconian Saale Valley Railway, serves Gemünden am Main, Bad Kissingen and Schweinfurt, ending not at the central station but {{continuing}} to <b>Schweinfurt</b> <b>Stadt.</b>|$|R
50|$|Regionalbahn {{services}} also {{supplement the}} Regional Express train services. Services run hourly on the Würzburg-Schweinfurt line, continuing {{every two hours}} to Bamberg. Trains terminating in Schweinfurt in some cases continue to <b>Schweinfurt</b> <b>Stadt</b> station. On the Haßfurt-Bamberg section extra services run, increasing services to an hourly frequency. The trains are usually composed of a class 111 or class 143 locomotives and four or five Silberling carriages.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} five through {{platforms}} for passengers. Two bay platforms {{directly in front}} of the station building are no longer needed for scheduled services since trains from Bad Kissingen and Meiningen now pass through the Hauptbahnhof and stop at the more centrally-sited <b>Schweinfurt</b> <b>Stadt</b> station. All platforms have a height of 38 cm and are accessed by flights of stairs from an underpass.|$|R
50|$|A {{short time}} later the tender for local railway {{services}} from the Bavarian Railway Company (Bayerische Eisenbahngesellschaft) was won by Erfurter Bahn. After the timetable change on 12 December 2004 it took over services on route no. KBS 803 under the name Lower Franconia Shuttle (Unterfranken-Shuttle), that planned through services as far as <b>Schweinfurt</b> <b>Stadt</b> station. The EIB procured twently RegioShuttle RS1 multiples for this purpose. These single-coach diesel railbuses are designed for rapid and easy coupling or unmcoupling using Scharfenberg couplers. Panoramic windows, cushioned seats and air-conditioning offer high levels of comfort. On the Saale Valley Railway the DB's ticket machines were removed, because the EIB arranged for ticket machines in the train. Both DB and EIB tickets are accepted by the other organisation. In addition, {{since the end of}} 2005 there has been a special Franconian Saale Valley Ticket (Fränkisches Saaletal Ticket) for return journeys between Bad Kissingen and Gemünden am Main for one person.|$|R
