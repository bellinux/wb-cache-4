In this paper, we present a case with typical face appearance consisting of acrocephaly, high and prominent forehed, antimogoloid axis, hypertelorism, proptosis, mid-facial hypoplasia, symmetric <b>syndactylia</b> of hands and feet, many synostosis on both hands and cutaneous syndactylies, cerebellar hypoplasia, cervical vertebra fusion, and to discuss the clinical features of Apert syndrome...|$|E
40|$|A five-year-old {{boy with}} Möbius syndrome, Poland's anomaly, and dextrocardia is described. These malformations {{have not been}} {{previously}} reported. The propositus had ipsilateral absence of the sternal portion of the pectoralis major muscle associated with acromicria, syndactyly, brachydactyly of the index, middle, ring, and fifth finger, as well as radiological evidence of hypoplasia of the index middle and ring fingers, associated with <b>syndactylia</b> and absent middle phalanges...|$|E

In this paper, we reported a 10 day-old new born who was hospitalized because of respiratory distress. He was diagnosed as Apert syndrome with the typical features of coronal synostosis, hyperteleorism, symmetric syndactyly of hands and feet and corpus callosum hypoplasia...|$|E
40|$|Hypohidrotic {{ectodermal}} dysplasia (HED) is a syndrome characterized by hypodontia, hypotrichosis, and partial or total ecrine sweat gland deficiency. The most prevalent form of HED is inherited as an X linked pattern. Glucose- 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G- 6 -PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disease, {{which leads to}} hemolytic anemia and jaundice. It is expressed in males, while heterozygous females are usually clinically normal. A 12 -year-old boy with the complaints of hair and eyebrow disturbances, teeth disfigurement, decreased sweating, and xerosis presented to the outpatient clinic. Dermatological examination revealed sparse hair and eyebrows, conical- shaped teeth, xerosis, <b>syndactylia,</b> transverse grooves, and discoloration of nails. Laboratory findings indicated anemia. His 3 -year-old sister also had sparse hair and eyebrows, xerosis, and <b>syndactylia.</b> We learned that the patient had a previous history of neonatal jaundice and a diagnosis of G- 6 -PD deficiency. Although {{it has been shown}} that loci of {{ectodermal dysplasia}} and G- 6 -PD deficiency genes are near to one another, we did not find any case study reporting on occurrence of these two genetic diseases together. With the aspect of this rare and interesting case, the relationship between HED and G- 6 -PD deficiency was defined. (Ann Dermatol 23 (S 1) S 8 ∼S 10...|$|E
40|$|Dyskeratosis {{congenital}} (DC) {{is a rare}} condition {{characterized by}} reticulate skin hyperpigmentation, mucosal leukoplakia, and nail dystrophy. More serious features are bone marrow involvement with pancytopenia and a predisposition to malignancy. The purpose of this case report is to describe the oral and dental findings in children with DC syndrome. A 10 -year-old male diagnosed with DC was admitted because of extensive caries and toothache. Inadequate oral hygiene and extensive caries were observed in oral examination of the patient. Plaque accumulation was seen in gingival border of maxillary teeth. Papillary atrophy on the tongue was observed. Short and blunted roots of mandible incisors and upper and lower molars were determined on the radiographic examination. Dryness on the lips and commisuras, ectropion on his eyes, and epiphora were observed. Hematologic tests were performed and showed aplastic anemia {{at the age of}} 2. At the age of 4, the bone marrow transplantation was performed. Dermatological findings occurred after the bone marrow transplantation. The skin of the patient was thin, dry, and wrinkled in some areas. He had palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and <b>syndactylia</b> on his fingers. Endodontic treatment procedures were applied and other extensive caries are still being restored. The patient will be given full preventive care during regular follow-up. Oral hygiene was improved to the optimum level...|$|E
40|$|Genetic burden size {{estimation}} of the world population and its individual components has a great theoretical and practical (medical) significance, and genetic determinators of congenital defects represent {{one of its most}} interesting components. Congenital anomaly of fists and feet may occur in different forms. In this paper we studied the incidence of syndactyly (<b>syndactylia),</b> clinodactyly (clynodactylia) and polydactyly (polydactylia) in a sample of newborns of Tuzla Canton. Data were collected at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics of University Clinical Center in Tuzla. The main source of needed information was disease history of mothers and newborns. The observed anomalies were registered by first pediatric examination of newborns. The study included 8419 infants (4335 males and 4084 females) of which 7793 passed and 626 undelivered newborns, born during the time period 2007 - 2008 year. The total incidence of anomalies in the analyzed sample was 0, 23 %, of which the relative frequency of polydactyly is 0, 05 %, syndactyly 0, 07 % and clinodactyly 0, 11 %. The highest frequency of the studied anomalies was observed in the subsample of undelivered newborns (0, 80 %), and in the subsample of delivered newborns was 0, 18 %. Comparison of our data with literature data showed that the frequency of observed anomalies falls in the range of variation of parameters investigated in other populations...|$|E
40|$|Sprague Dawley系ラットの出生前(妊娠 20 日) の妊娠状況を検討し,また自然発生の外表(口腔も含む) 奇形,内臓奇形及び骨格奇形,骨格変異,化骨進行度について観察した。妊娠状態は, 1 腹平均着床痕跡数 14. 8, 1 腹平均生存胎仔数 13. 4,平均胎盤重量 482. 2 mgであった。死亡胎仔は吸収胚と浸軟胎仔がみられ,胎仔死亡率 9. 6 %である。生存胎仔の雌雄のそれぞれの総数は全く同数であった。また生存胎仔平均体重は 3. 65 ± 0. 017 g(♂ 3. 75 g,♀ 3. 55 g) である。外表及び内臓異常の種類は腹壁ヘルニア,眼瞼開存,眼球突出,大舌症,曲尾,指趾異常,無腎症である。腹壁ヘルニア以外の異常胎仔は全て同一母体より発現し,しかも単一奇形よりむしろ 1 胎仔に数種の奇形が併発していた。骨格系異常は右第 13 肋骨欠損,頸椎弓異常がそれぞれ 1 例発現した。その他は骨変異と考えられるもので,第 7 頸椎骨の肋骨痕,胸椎体変異,軽度の第 1 腰椎体変異,第 14 肋骨,胸骨片変異が観察された。本実験飼育条件下において,Sprague Dawley-JCL系ラットの自然発生奇形は 1. 5 %の発現率を示した。It {{is noted}} that the incidences and types of the {{spontaneous}} congenital malformations in laboratory animals are different not only among species but among strains, which results from the differences of sensitivities. Accordingly, {{in order to determine}} the teratogenicity of drugs, it is necessary to perform a preliminary test on the reproduction of the used strain under a constant environmental conditions. We carried out studies on the pregnancy status and the spontaneous malformations, employing rats of Sprague Dawley-JCL strain. The results are as follows: As for the pregnancy status on the day before birth, average number of implants and of living fetuses per litter was 14. 8 and 13. 4 respectively. The frequency of embryonic deaths including resorptions and macerated fetuses was calculated at 9. 6 %, and the mean placental weight was 482. 2 mg. Living fetuses weighed 3. 65 ± 0. 017 g (male 3. 75 g, female 3. 55 g) on an average. The gross anomalies were abdominal hernia, kinky tail, macroglossia, open eyelid, exophthalmos, <b>syndactylia,</b> ectrodactylia and anephrogenesis. Among the malformed fetuses were many that showed a combination of such anomalies. And only few cases presented a single malformation. In the skeletal system, we observed two abnormal cases. One anomaly was the unilateral absence of 13 th rib and the other was malformed cervical arch. Other changes should be considered as variations of bones, e. g., variations of thoracic centra or sternebrae, cervical ribs and 14 th ribs. The incidence of spontaneous congenital malformations in rats of Sprague Dawley-JCL strain was at a considerably high level of 1. 5 % under the experimental conditions...|$|E
