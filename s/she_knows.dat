60|$|The {{beautiful}} {{lady with}} the silvery hair sat and gazed on him admiringly. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> could trust him; <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> {{he would keep}} it in.

Severely bruised, Michelle Charters (Teryl Rothery) claims that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> who was responsible and names the attacker as Hal Arden, an elderly resident of Excelsis Dei.

Shortly after planting the bomb, Flores is assassinated by a sniper in retaliation for his cooperation with General Salazar. The car bomb meant to kill Ruiz instead kills Agent Castro, but Gordon and Ruiz survive.|$|E
60|$|And as {{she peered}} into their smooth, humble faces, {{all at once}} <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> why they had come. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> it even before they put their {{proposals}} into words; <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> why the praetorian praefect was so servile, and why my lord Hortensius Martius, despite his obvious weakness, wore an air of triumph.|$|R
5000|$|Together {{with federal}} and state investigators, Aquash's daughters Denise and Debby believe that {{high-ranking}} AIM leaders ordered {{the death of their}} mother due to fears of her being an informant; they support the continued investigation. Denise Pictou-Maloney {{is the executive director of}} the [...] "Indigenous Women for Justice", a group she founded to support justice for her mother and other Native women. In a 2004 interview, Pictou-Maloney said her mother was killed by AIM members who [...] "thought <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> too much. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> what was happening in California, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> where the money was coming from to pay for the guns, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> the plans, but more than any of that, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> about the killings." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1923, {{when he was}} 4, {{his parents}} {{separated}} and later divorced. He and his surviving sister, Mary, were raised by their mother first in Springfield, Massachusetts and later in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His mother was a firm influence but never overbearing. One of Brewster's friends characterized her as [...] "one of those people whose presence you always felt {{when she was in}} the room". Another friend remembered that [...] "she <b>knew</b> poetry, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> music, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> art, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> architecture, and believe me, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> Kingman." ...|$|R

5|$|Later, Means and Black {{listen to}} McKenna reading {{a passage from}} the Bible. Afterwards, McKenna reveals that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> {{a great deal about}} the Polaroid Man who kidnapped Black weeks earlier. Means {{receives}} a vision herself during the conversation, and becomes convinced that McKenna is a prophet of some sort. Black thinks the girl is acting out, but Means reveals that she is reciting passages from the non-canonical Gnostic Gospels, which supposed that Mary Magdalene was the only disciple to fully understand the teachings of Jesus Christ. Means believes the girls are not seeing visions of Saint Mary, but of Mary Magdalene.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} the next day, October 1, 2004, with his arm bandaged up, while Kate looks on. She tells Sawyer that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> {{the letter was written}} when Sawyer was a kid, and also works out that the letter wasn't written to Sawyer, but by him. He tells Kate that his real name isn't Sawyer and that the letter was written to the real Sawyer, a con man, who ruined his family. He ended up {{becoming}} a con man himself, so he took the name Sawyer as an alias. He snatches the letter from Kate and tells her not to feel sorry for him and to leave.|$|E

6000|$|... "She left us of her {{own free}} will," [...] he said, [...] "and I don't believe, Elizabeth, that she would ever come back again. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> very well what she was doing. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> that our views of life were not hers. <b>She</b> didn't <b>know</b> half but <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> enough. You were quite right in what you said just now; Beatrice was more like her mother, and {{her mother was a}} good woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I've {{stayed at}} Halliday's flat with Birkin,' he said, meeting her slow, calm eyes. And <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that the Pussum {{was one of}} his mistresses--and he <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew.</b>|$|R
5|$|The office formulates two {{plans to}} save their jobs. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is tasked with {{tracking}} down Robert at a squash court and intercepting the emails before California {{has a chance to}} view them, while Andy, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) head to Schrute Farms, ostensibly to try and change Dwight's mind. However, Pam consistently silences any attempt to bring up the device, saying <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> Dwight and is confident that he will stop the device on his own. After complimenting Dwight numerous times and having a small meal, Pam makes a joke that emphasizes that everyone is human and makes mistakes.|$|E
5|$|A {{visit by}} Dahlia Brinkley, the only Springfield Elementary {{graduate}} ever to enter an Ivy League college, gives Lisa a severe inferiority complex {{because she is}} involved in very few extracurricular activities. When Ned Flanders resigns as coach of Bart's Little League team, the Springfield Isotots, Lisa seizes the chance to extend her résumé and takes the position. Since <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> nothing about baseball, she seeks advice from the patrons of Moe's Tavern, who direct her to Professor Frink and his scientific colleagues. She learns about sabermetrics from them and uses this science to organize the Isotots' strategy; as a result, their record quickly improves and they rise in the league standings. However, Bart eventually rebels against her management, saying that she has taken all {{the fun out of}} the game, and hits a home run despite her orders to let the pitcher walk him. The Isotots win the game, but Lisa throws Bart off the team for his insubordination.|$|E
5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils {{of the world in}} the box, she placed her power of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> how to use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E
60|$|Faster, wilder, and {{stranger}} {{the music}} rose; but Elma sat still, her breast heaving hard, and her breath panting, yet otherwise as still and motionless as a statue. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> Miss Ewes could tell exactly how <b>she</b> felt. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> was trying her; <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> was tempting {{her to get}} up and dance; and yet, she was not one bit afraid of this strange weird woman, as she'd been afraid that sad morning at home of her own mother.|$|R
6000|$|She {{came home}} by the unvarying route. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> every house-front, every street-crossing, every billboard, every tree, every dog. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> every {{blackened}} banana-skin and empty cigarette-box in the gutters. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> every greeting. When Jim Howland stopped and gaped at her there was no possibility {{that he was about}} to confide anything but his grudging, [...] "Well, haryuh t'day?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{could not}} help it, {{that she was a}} traveller. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> Anthony, that he was not one. But oh, {{ultimately}} and finally, she must go on and on, seeking the goal that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> did draw nearer to.|$|R
5|$|Boone offers Bryan $25,000 {{to break}} up with Shannon but Bryan asks for $50,000 and Boone agrees. Boone also reveals that Bryan {{is not the first}} man he has paid off to leave Shannon alone. Shannon refuses to leave with Boone. He realizes that Shannon lied to him to get the money, and she has done this all the other times he had to pay off her boyfriends. Bryan says that Boone's mother stole money away from her, and she is getting what is {{rightfully}} hers. After a brief fight with Bryan in which he is beaten, Boone leaves. That night, a drunk Shannon comes to Boone's hotel room and tells him that Bryan stole the money. She tells Boone that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> he loves her and, although he first tries to refuse her advances, they sleep together. Later, Shannon persuades Boone not to tell their parents.|$|E
5|$|Dax confides in Sisko that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> {{she is in}} {{love with}} her former wife. He tells her that Trill customs mean that if they resumed their relationship, then they would be exiled from their homeworld and their {{symbionts}} would never be joined with a new host, but that she will have his support either way. Kahn and Dax continue to work on the experiment, but it goes wrong and Defiant is severely damaged. Kahn is injured in the explosion, but Dax rigs a force field across a plasma fire that allows her to reach Kahn, coming to the realization that the relationship is worth exile. After returning to the station, Kahn recuperates from her injuries. She decides against resuming her relationship with Dax, and—with the experiments complete—departs with the science team, leaving Dax heartbroken.|$|E
5|$|Dilbeck's {{personal}} interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> too much. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter. However, Erin and a police officer Al Garcia (Armand Assante) begin to suspect the congressman's guilt in the murders, and Erin concocts a plan to bring the congressman to justice. She tricks him into confessing on tape, and he is soon after arrested. Thus, Erin regains full custody of Angela, quits stripping, and gets back her job in the FBI. Darrell returns to prison after he is convicted of his crimes.|$|E
6000|$|Zulime looked {{somewhat}} incredulous (<b>she</b> didn't <b>know</b> me yet), but {{her eyes}} glowed with pleasure {{at the thought of}} the capital, of which <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> nothing, and of New York, which <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> only as a seaport. [...] "I thought you were poor," [...] she said.|$|R
60|$|But {{she dared}} {{not make a}} light, because <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> he would wake, {{and she did not}} want to break his perfect sleep, that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> he had got of her.|$|R
60|$|My {{pity for}} her vanished. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> {{it was her}} mistress's son as well as I! And for some time <b>she</b> had <b>known,</b> <b>she</b> had felt.|$|R
5|$|During {{the repair}} efforts, Yar becomes close to Castillo, but is unnerved by tense {{interactions}} with Guinan. Guinan reveals to Yar that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> Yar dies a meaningless {{death in the}} other timeline, and that the two should never have met. Based on her discussion with Guinan, Yar requests a transfer to the Enterprise-C, which is granted by Picard. As the Enterprise-C prepares to return through the anomaly, three Klingon battlecruisers attack. With the anomaly becoming unstable, Picard orders the Enterprise-D to cover the Enterprise-C's withdrawal. The Enterprise-D suffers major crew losses under the Klingon barrage, including the death of Commander Riker, forcing Picard to man the tactical station himself. With the Enterprise-D {{on the brink of}} destruction, the Enterprise-C traverses the anomaly, triggering the return of Enterprise-D's original timeline. In the restored timeline, Guinan– the only one subtly aware of what has transpired– asks Geordi La Forge to tell her more about Yar.|$|E

Emma tells Ashley that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> how it feels to have a baby at a young age. She encourages Ashley to take charge and change her life. Later that evening, Ashley breaks into Mr. Gold's pawn shop and steals a contract from a safe. While there, she is confronted by Mr. Gold, who attempts to stop her. Ashley attacks him, leaving him unconscious on the floor of his shop.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Number 18 {{was one of}} the girls in the storage truck, but that she escaped and ended up at The Pearl. Traumatized, she does not understand what Jason wants. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> that every girl who has talked about the storage truck incident has been killed and is therefore reluctant to testify. One night Number 18 is injured in a party at the brothel and can barely walk when Jason visits. When he tells Ali about his experiences, she begs him to come home, but Jason believes he is in Bangkok by divine providence. Number 18 comes to understand that Jason is not like the other men who frequent The Pearl, and agrees to trust him and testify against the brothel ring if he can rescue her.|$|E
60|$|Joan had dreaded this question, which <b>she</b> had <b>known</b> {{would inevitably}} come. She wanted to lie; <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> ought to lie; {{but it was}} impossible.|$|R
