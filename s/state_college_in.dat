5|$|A {{professional}} football career was unlikely for Willis when {{he graduated from}} Ohio State in 1945. While the exclusion of black players was not a written rule, no African-American had played in the National Football League since 1933. The gentlemen's agreement had been in effect ever since segregationist George Preston Marshall entered the league as owner of the Boston Redskins. In his physical prime but with no real prospect of playing professionally, Willis {{took a job as}} the head football coach at Kentucky <b>State</b> <b>College</b> <b>in</b> the fall of 1945. Kentucky State, an historically black school, played against other small black schools near its campus in Frankfort.|$|E

5|$|Mallinckrodt Incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, {{took the}} raw ore and {{dissolved}} it in nitric acid to produce uranyl nitrate. Ether was then {{added in a}} liquid–liquid extraction process to separate the impurities from the uranyl nitrate. This was then heated to form uranium trioxide, which was reduced to highly pure uranium dioxide. By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into uranium metal initially proved more difficult for contractors Westinghouse and Metal Hydrides. Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low. A special branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at Iowa <b>State</b> <b>College</b> <b>in</b> Ames, Iowa, under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives. This {{became known as the}} Ames Project, and its Ames process became available in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Due to lack {{of space}} at the University of Chicago, Spedding {{proposed}} to organise part of the Chemistry Division at Iowa <b>State</b> <b>College</b> <b>in</b> Ames, where he had colleagues {{who were willing to}} help. It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The first problem on the agenda was to find uranium for the nuclear reactor that Enrico Fermi was proposing to build. The only uranium metal available commercially was produced by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a photochemical process that produced ingots the size of a quarter that were sold for around $20 per gram. Edward Creutz, the head of the group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments. With Westinghouse's process, it would have cost $200,000 and taken a year to produce.|$|E

5|$|Sledd had not {{anticipated}} that the Lake City campus would be abandoned, and had assumed {{that it would be}} selected as the location of the newly consolidated men's university, placing him in a strong position to become the first president of the new institution. The selection of Gainesville for the campus of the new men's university put Sledd's future as its first president in question. The University of Florida in Lake City {{was just one of the}} four existing institutions that were to be merged to form the new university, and there were other possible candidates for the presidency. Albert A. Murphree, president of Florida <b>State</b> <b>College</b> <b>in</b> Tallahassee, was the favorite of several prominent members of the legislature. But Sledd had Governor Broward's backing, and the Board of Control ultimately selected him to be the first president on June 7, 1905; Sledd's appointment was for a single year, but renewable on an annual basis, as was typical in the university's early years when the Board of Control appointed or re-appointed the presidents of the state's public colleges for each academic year. Murphree remained the president of the newly consolidated women's college in Tallahassee until 1909.|$|E
