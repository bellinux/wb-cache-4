5|$|In July 2017 the {{critical}} WiFi vulnerability BroadPwn affecting many iOS devices, including the iPad 2 was published. It allows an attacker to remotely {{take control of}} all affected devices within WiFi range without any user interaction. Since iOS 9 is in its end of life the iPad 2 won't receive a <b>security</b> <b>patch</b> for this vulnerability, making it dangerous to use them further.|$|E
500|$|... iOS 10.3 was {{released}} on March 27, 2017. The update introduced a [...] "Find My AirPods" [...] feature for lost AirPods headphones, changed the file system to Apple File System (APFS) for improved performance and encryption (also increases usable storage on the device), support for additional Siri actions, including status of bills in payment apps and scheduling with ride-booking apps, a new Apple ID view in Settings, the ability for developers to respond to reviews in the App Store as well as [...] "Helpful" [...] and [...] "Not Helpful" [...] review labels, improved overview of iCloud storage usage, and bug fixes and stability improvements. Users can also give app ratings inside the app itself. iOS 10.3 also features a significant <b>security</b> <b>patch</b> fixing an issue where a JavaScript exploit link would cause devices to repeatedly call the 9-1-1 emergency phone number. The update also added a Podcasts widget and made app transitions smoother, and extended support for Wi-Fi calling to more carriers. For CarPlay, the update added a quick-access multitasking screen with the three most recently used apps, and added functionality for the Maps app to find electric vehicle charging stations.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2017, {{information}} on a critical Wi-Fi security vulnerability affecting one billion iOS and Android devices was published. The issue, named [...] "BroadPwn", allows an attacker to remotely take control of nearby, vulnerable smartphones and turn affected devices into [...] "rogue access points", further spreading the infection to other nearby devices. Apple released a <b>security</b> <b>patch</b> for the issue {{as part of its}} iOS 10.3.3 update, though older devices running iOS 9, including iPad 2, were left without an available update, causing concerns over the safety of the product in schools.|$|E

40|$|Many {{open-source}} projects land security fixes {{in public}} repositories before shipping these patches to users. This paper presents attacks on such projects - taking Firefox as a case-study - that exploit patch metadata to efficiently search for <b>security</b> <b>patches</b> prior to shipping. Using access-restricted bug reports linked from <b>patch</b> descriptions, <b>security</b> <b>patches</b> can be immediately identified for 260 out of 300 days of Firefox 3 development. In response to Mozilla obfuscating descriptions, {{we show that}} machine learning can exploit metadata such as patch author to search for <b>security</b> <b>patches,</b> extending the total window of vulnerability by 5 months in an 8 month period when examining up to two patches daily. Finally we present strong evidence that further metadata obfuscation is unlikely to prevent information leaks, and we argue that open-source projects instead ought to keep <b>security</b> <b>patches</b> secret until {{they are ready to}} be released.

However, Microsoft's support {{lifecycle}} policy treats Windows 8.1 similarly to previous Windows service packs: it is part of Windows 8's support lifecycle, and upgrading to 8.1 has been required to maintain access to mainstream support and updates after January 12, 2016. Although Windows 8 RTM is unsupported, Microsoft released an emergency <b>security</b> <b>patch</b> in May 2017 for Windows 8 RTM, as well as other unsupported versions of Windows (including Windows XP and Windows Server 2003), to address a vulnerability that was being leveraged by the WannaCry ransomware attack.|$|E
