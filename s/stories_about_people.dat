5|$|Each {{year on the}} Feast of Saint Jovan Vladimir, a {{great number}} of devotees come to the monastery, popularly known as Shingjon among Albanians. In the morning, the reliquary is placed {{at the center of the}} church under a canopy, before being opened. After the morning liturgy has been celebrated, {{chanting}} priests carry the reliquary three times around the church, followed by the devotees, who hold lit candles. The reliquary is then placed in front of the church, to be kissed by the believers. The priests give them pieces of cotton that have been kept inside the reliquary since the previous feast. There are numerous <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>people,</b> both Christians and Muslims, who were healed after they prayed before the saint's relics.|$|E

500|$|Eager {{for better}} credentials, in 1925 Brinkley {{traveled}} to Europe searching for honorary degrees. After being rebuffed by several institutes in the United Kingdom, Brinkley found a willing suitor {{in the university}} in Pavia, Italy. Fishbein and Brinkley's former teacher, Max Thorek, heard about the degree and pressured the Italian government to rescind it. Benito Mussolini himself revoked the degree, though Brinkley claimed it until he died. [...] Fishbein's interest in putting Brinkley out of business grew and he wrote more articles featuring <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> who had grown sick or died after seeing Brinkley. But the AMA journal's readership was mostly restricted to other doctors, while Brinkley's radio station poured directly into peoples' homes every day.|$|E
500|$|Born in 1926, Harper Lee {{grew up in}} the Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, {{where she}} became close friends with soon-to-be famous writer [...] Truman Capote. She {{attended}} Huntingdon College in Montgomery (1944–45), and then studied law at the University of Alabama (1945–49). While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine Rammer Jammer at the University of Alabama. At both colleges, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time. In 1950, Lee moved to New York City, where she worked as a reservation clerk for British Overseas Airways Corporation; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> in Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a literary agent recommended by Capote. An editor at J. B. Lippincott, who bought the manuscript, advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing. Donations from friends allowed her to write uninterrupted for a year.|$|E

500|$|Stanley Schmidt was an {{assistant}} professor of physics when he became editor of Analog, and his scientific background was well-suited to the magazine's readership. [...] He avoided making drastic changes, and continued the long-standing tradition of writing provocative editorials, though he rarely discussed science fiction. In 1979 he resurrected [...] "Probability Zero", a feature that Campbell had run in the early 1940s that published tall tales—humorous stories with ludicrous or impossible scientific premises. [...] Also in 1979 Schmidt began a series of columns titled [...] "The Alternate View", an opinion column that was written in alternate issues by G. Harry Stine and Jerry Pournelle, and which is still a feature of the magazine as of 2016, though now with different contributors. [...] The stable of fiction contributors remained largely unchanged from Bova's day, and included many names, such as Poul Anderson, Gordon R. Dickson, and George O. Smith, familiar to readers from the Campbell era. [...] This continuity led to criticisms within the field, Bruce Sterling writing in 1984 that the magazine [...] "has become old, dull, and drivelling... It is a situation screaming for reform. [...] Analog no longer permits itself to be read." [...] The magazine thrived nevertheless, and though part of the increase in circulation during the early 1980s may have been due to Davis Publications' energetic efforts to increase subscriptions, Schmidt knew what his readership wanted and made sure they got it, commenting in 1985: [...] "I reserve Analog for the kind of science fiction I've described here: good <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> with problems in which some piece of plausible (or at least not demonstrably implausible) speculative science plays an indispensable role".|$|E

60|$|The steward's {{guaranty}} was perforce satisfactory. The company, therefore, {{took their}} places, and addressed {{themselves to the}} serious business of the feast, but were soon disturbed by the hypochondriac, who thrust back his chair, complaining that a dish of stewed toads and vipers was set before him, {{and that there was}} green ditchwater in his cup of wine. This mistake being amended, he quietly resumed his seat. The wine, as it flowed freely from the sepulchral urn, seemed to come imbued with all gloomy inspirations; so that its influence was not to cheer, but either to sink the revellers into a deeper melancholy, or elevate their spirits to an enthusiasm of wretchedness. The conversation was various. They told sad <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>people</b> who might have been Worthy guests at such a festival as the present. They talked of grisly incidents in human history; of strange crimes, which, if truly considered, were but convulsions of agony; of some lives that had been altogether wretched, and of others, which, wearing a general semblance of happiness, had yet been deformed, sooner or later, by misfortune, as by the intrusion of a grim face at a banquet; of death-bed scenes, and what dark intimations might be gathered from the words of dying men; of suicide, and whether the more eligible mode were by halter, knife, poison, drowning, gradual starvation, or the fumes of charcoal. The majority of the guests, as is the custom with people thoroughly and profoundly sick at heart, were anxious to make their own woes the theme of discussion, and prove themselves most excellent in anguish. The misanthropist went deep into the philosophy of evil, and wandered about in the darkness, with now and then a gleam of discolored light hovering on ghastly shapes and horrid scenery. Many a miserable thought, such as men have stumbled upon from age to age, did he now rake up again, and gloat over it as an inestimable gem, a diamond, a treasure far preferable to those bright, spiritual revelations of a better world, which are like precious stones from heaven's pavement. And then, amid his lore of wretchedness he hid his face and wept.|$|E
