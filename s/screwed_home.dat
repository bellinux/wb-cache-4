30|$|Despite {{advances}} in TKA design, many patients still experience limited kinematics in their normal daily function, leading to reduced patient satisfaction (Banks et al., 2003; Most et al., 2005). During our deep knee bend simulation, TKA showed substantial reduction in internal tibial rotation compared to normal knee. This trend {{was similar to}} previous study (Varadarajan et al., 2009). In particularly, conventional did not show the characteristic <b>screw</b> <b>home</b> motion low flexion angle. Conventional TKA has design that does not describe present normal knee anatomy thus it was found more. This {{is evident in the}} Asian population, where an average individual is required to adopt special posture positions in their daily activities, such as a gait or a deep-knee-bend (Hefzy et al., 1998). To overcome this, several TKA designs proposed new features such as changing the posterior sagittal femoral geometry to prevent the occurrence of PE edge loading and increase the articulation curvature during deep-knee flexion (Zelle et al., 2009). However, greater flexion angles have led to a high poly wear rate, which results in an increased number of surgeries required for patients during their lifetime.|$|R

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{knee joint}} motion data during level walking {{were obtained from}} 34 males and 33 females using a 6 -degree-of-freedom electrogoniometer. Normal motion pattern of active flexion (full extension to 20 deg. flex.), active extension (20 deg. flex. to full extension) and early stance phase during gait cycle were evaluated to find the physical difference based on sex and age. Adduction and internal rotation (male 85. 3 %, female 66. 7 %) were shown in the normal motion pattern during active flexion of the knees while abduction and external rotation (male 91. 2 %, female 90. 9 %) {{were found in the}} pattern during active extension of the knees. The <b>screw</b> <b>home</b> motion is detected during active extension (male 61. 8 %, female 90. 9 %). Adduction and internal rotation (male 97. 1 %, female 81. 8 %) were shown in the normal motion pattern during early stance phase. Females tend to change the pattern of motion with weight bearing. Adduction at early stance phase and abduction under active flexion are shown in females by 12. 9 %. On the other hand, there is the pattern change by only 2. 9 %, in males.

40|$|In vivo {{fluoroscopy}} is {{a well-known}} technique to analyze joint kinematics of the replaced knee. With this method, however, the contact areas between femoral and tibial components, fundamental for monitoring wear and validating design concepts, are hard to identify. We developed and tested a novel technique to assess condylar and post-cam contacts in TKA. The technique uses in vivo motion data of the replaced knee from standard fluoroscopy as input for finite element models of the prosthesis components. In these models, tibiofemoral contact patterns at the condyles and post-cam articulations were calculated during various activities. To test for feasibility, the technique was applied to a bicruciate posterior-stabilized prosthesis. Sensitivity of the finite element analysis, validation of the technique, and in vivo tests were performed. To test for potential in the clinical setting, five patients were preliminarily analyzed during chair rising-sitting, stair climbing, and step up-down. For each task and patient, the condylar contact points and contact line rotation were calculated. The results were repeatable and consistent with corresponding calculations from traditional fluoroscopic analysis. Specifically, natural knee kinematics, which shows rolling back and <b>screw</b> <b>home,</b> seemed replicated in all motor tasks. Post-cam contact was observed on both the anterior and posterior faces. Anterior contact is limited to flexion angle close to extension; posterior contact occurs in deeper flexion but {{is dependent on the}} motor task. The data suggest the proposed technique provides reliable information to analyze post-cam contacts. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{geometry}} of the tibial plateau has a direct influence on the translation and the <b>screw</b> <b>home</b> biomechanics of the tibiofemoral joint. Little information {{on the relationship between}} the tibial slope and meniscal lesions is available. The objective of this retrospective {{study was to examine the}} effect of the tibial slope on the medial and lateral meniscus lesions in patients with intact ACLs. Materials and Methods: The MRIs and lat roentgenograms of 212 patients with meniscus lesions were examined to determine the possible effect of the tibial slope on meniscal tears. First, the anatomic axis of the proximal tibia was established. Then, the angle between the line drawn to show the tibial slopes (medial and lateral) and the line drawn perpendicular to the proximal tibial anatomic axis was established on MRI. The patients with previously detected meniscus lesions were classified into three categories: patients with only medial meniscal tear (Group 1, 90 patients); patients with only lateral meniscal tear (Group 2, 15 patients); and patients with both medial and lateral meniscal tear (Group 3, 19 patients). Group 4 had no meniscal tear (88 patients). The MRIs of the patients who had applied to the Orthopedic Outpatient Clinic with patellofemoral pain and no meniscal tear were included as the control group. Results: The average tibial slope of the medial tibial plateau was 3. 18 ° in group 1, 3. 64 ° in group 2, 3 ° in group 3, and 3. 27 ° in group 4. The average tibial slope of the lateral tibial plateau was 2. 88 ° in group 1, 3. 6 ° in group 2, 2. 68 in group 3, and 2. 91 in group 4. The tibial slope on the medial tibial plateau was significantly larger than the lateral tibial plateaus in group 1 and group 4 (p 0. 05). In addition, the tibial slope on the lateral side of group 2 was significantly larger than that of groups 1, 3, and 4 (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: An increase in the tibial slopes, especially on the lateral tibial plateau, seems to increase the risk of meniscal tear...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Screw turbine was {{developed}} as alternative micro-hydro power plants. Its working principle {{is to use}} the river or irrigation with low discharge. The water flows into the turbine will drive the blades of screw turbine to rotate. Rotation of screw turbine will be forwarded to generator for converted into electrical energy. In this paper we will focus on the manufacturing process for small -scale of screw turbine to generate electricity voltage. Manufacturing process of screw turbine component as micro-hydro power plant consists of two components such as mechanical and electrical components. Mechanical components consist of a <b>screw</b> turbine, <b>home</b> of turbine <b>screw,</b> shaft of turbine and bearings. The manufacturing process includes the cutting plate process, drawing process and joining. Electrical component is a generator with the rotor (magnets) and the stator (coil) and then assembly the mechanical and electrical components. After the assembled all component then followed performance testing of the screw turbine and generator. From the manufacturing process of screw turbine and generator are obtained the results of rotation and electric voltage...|$|R
60|$|Having made fast a {{piece of}} very good new line, at about two-thirds from {{the lower end of}} one of the beams, the purchase-tackle of the derrick was hooked into the turns of the line, and it was speedily raised by the number of men on the rock {{and the power of the}} winch tackle. When this log was lifted to a {{sufficient}} height, its foot, or lower end, was stepped into the spot which had been previously prepared for it. Two of the great iron stanchions were then set in their respective holes on each side of the beam, when a rope was passed round them and the beam, to prevent it from slipping till it could be more permanently fixed. The derrick, or upright spar used for carrying the tackle to raise the first beam, was placed in such a position as to become useful for supporting the upper end of it, which now became, in its turn, the prop of the tackle for raising the second beam. The whole difficulty of this operation was in the raising and propping of the first beam, which became a convenient derrick for raising the second, these again a pair of shears for lifting the third, and the shears a triangle for raising the fourth. Having thus got four of the six principal beams set on end, it required a considerable degree of trouble to get their upper ends to fit. Here they formed the apex of a cone, and were all together mortised into a large piece of beechwood, and secured, for the present, with ropes, in a temporary manner. During the short period of one tide all that could further be done for their security was to put a single screw-bolt through the great kneed bats or stanchions on each side of the beams, and <b>screw</b> the nut <b>home.</b>|$|R
