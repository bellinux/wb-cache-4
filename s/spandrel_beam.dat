Spandrel or vision glass may also contain translucent glass, which could be for security or aesthetic purposes.

Results from specimens having different <b>spandrel</b> <b>beam</b> sizes and different amounts of torsional reinforcement in the spandrel beams provided {{a better understanding of}} their behaviour. The test specimens were heavily instrumented to enable detailed strain measurements in the slab bars, the joint region and the <b>spandrel</b> <b>beam.</b> These strains together with the crack pattern provide some insight into the flow of forces from the slab and <b>spandrel</b> <b>beam</b> into the joint region. The tests show that the effective width of the slab contributing to the negative bending of the main beam is affected by the torsional yielding of the <b>spandrel</b> <b>beam.</b> However, after this yielding, a different force mechanism, involving concrete compressive struts, and tension ties in the slab and <b>spandrel</b> <b>beam</b> bars, provides means of transferring additional forces from the slab bars to the joint region. It is important to consider the effect of these forces since they increase the negative moment capacity of the beams, and hence, they may affect the hierarchy of yielding between the columns and the beams. This effect may in turn alter the failure mode of the structure. Tentative design proposals, accounting for the flow of forces through the <b>spandrel</b> <b>beam,</b> are presented.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceSutton F. StephensCold‐formed steel {{has become}} a {{preferred}} building material for wall framing in {{many different types of}} structures. One of its main uses has been as non‐structural members in curtain wall assemblies of structural steel framed buildings. In an exterior wall application, the main purpose of the curtain wall is to transfer out of plane loads to the steel frame while not supporting any superimposed gravity loads. Therefore, when the curtain wall is in the plane of the structural steel frame, the vertical deflection of the <b>spandrel</b> <b>beam</b> directly above the wall must be known to provide the appropriate deflection gap between the beam and the curtain wall so that gravity loads are not transferred to the wall. Common practice is to size the gap for the deflection from 100 % of the live load. In some cases, the deflection gap may be significant, and since this gap must also be provided in the exterior cladding of the wall, it creates a design issue for the architect. This report presents the results of an investigation into the feasibility of reducing the size of the deflection gap when the wall is located directly under the <b>spandrel</b> <b>beam.</b> In this study, analytical models were developed for common design situations of curtain walls constructed of cold‐formed steel studs in structural steel framed buildings. This study investigates two common stud heights combined with different floor live loads. Taking into account that wall studs have some available axial compressive strength, a procedure was developed to determine an appropriate reduction for the gap.

40|$|Research on the {{punching}} shear strength, Vu, of slab-column connections of reinforced and prestressed concrete flat plates with <b>spandrel</b> <b>beams</b> has received considerable attention by the engineering profession in recent years. In {{the case of}} slabcolumn-spandrel connections of flat plates at the edge- and corner- positions {{there is still no}} reliable procedure for the determination of Vu. Thus the main objective of the present study is to develop an analytical method for the prediction of Vu for these types of connections. Needless to say, the development of a sound analytical method requires the test results from large-scale models with proper boundary conditions. Tests up to failure were carried out on five cast-in-situ flat plate models, four with <b>spandrel</b> <b>beams</b> of different depths and steel ratios, and one without any spandrel. Representing two adjacent panels at the comer of a real structure these half- scale models were tested under simulated uniformly distributed loads. For ease of construction, instead of concrete columns, each flat plate model was supported on six prefabricated steel columns (with equivalent stiffnesses). The three reaction components at each of the hinged column supports were measured by means of specially designed load cells. Strain gauges were also attached to the reinforcing bars of the slab. The strains and other electrical signals were logged using a Hewlett Packard 3054 A data acquisition control system via a Hewlett Packard 9826 computer. In conjunction with the experimental work a theoretical study was carried out. This {{led to the development of}} a prediction procedure for the {{punching shear}} strength, Vu, of reinforced concrete flat plates with <b>spandrel</b> <b>beams.</b> Details of the theoretical work are presented herein. Applicable to the analysis of failures at the corner and edge-column positions, the proposed procedure takes in to consideration the following parameters: (1) the overall geometry of the connection, (2) the concrete strength, (3) the size and location of flexural reinforcement of the slab, (4) the slab restraint on the spandrel, and (5) the enhanced strength of the slab-column connection due to membrane effects. Based on the model test results from the present study and those obtained by other authors, a comparative study is carried out. The proposed analytical procedure is found to be superior to the alternative approach recommended in the new Australian Standard for Concrete Structures (AS 3600 - 1988).

Often, collapses of masonry portions supporting roofs may occur {{due to the}} roof thrust, which generates a destabilizing effect over motion. Nevertheless, the roof weight can produce a positive stabilizing effect for rotation amplitudes smaller than the critical value. The dynamics of a rocking masonry block interacting with roofs is discussed, by properly modifying the Housner equation of motion of the free-standing single degree-of-freedom block. The dependence of the restoring moment on the rotation angle is investigated and the minimum horizontal stiffness is calculated so that the same ultimate displacement as the system without roof thrust is obtained. Two case studies are presented as applicative examples of the proposed method: an unreinforced masonry structure tested on shaking table and a <b>spandrel</b> <b>beam</b> subjected to roof thrust that survived the Emilia Romagna earthquake.

40|$|The problem {{considered}} here {{concerns the}} transfer of load from the slab to the exterior columns of flat plate floor slabs. At the exterior columns, the load is transferred {{through a combination of}} shear, bending moment, and torsion. The distribution and magnitude of these forces and moments depend on the relative stiffness and strength of the spandrel beams. In general, the strength of the slab at the exterior edge is controlled by the limitations in the strength of the spandrel beams. In order to study the load transfer problem, a series of five 0. 3 scale reinforced concrete models, simulating the exterior column region of floor slabs, were tested to failure. The primary variables were the beam dimensions and reinforcement. The beam strength, which was primarily dependent upon the amount of lateral beam reinforcement, governed the amount of yielding in the slab and the extent of torsional cracking in the beam. In studying the behavior and strength of the sections, distributions of bending moments in the slab and torsional moments along the beam were determined and used in defining the failure criteria for the slab.

The effect of diagonal reinforcement of <b>spandrel</b> <b>beam</b> was also evaluated on the R factor. The R factor directly depends on overstrength factor and ductility reduction factor. For this purpose, three conventional structures with 5, 10 and 15 story buildings (having various spandrel beam's length/depth ratio with and without diagonal reinforcement) were selected and the nonlinear static analyses were conducted to evaluate their overstrength and ductility reduction factors. Also for a 5 -story structure, nonlinear dynamic analysis (time history) was carried out in order to compare the results with nonlinear static analysis. It was concluded that the R factors using nonlinear time history analysis and nonlinear static analysis are almost the same. The results also indicate that by increasing the height of the structure, the overstrength reduction factor decreases; while the ductility reduction factor increases.

Current torsional strengthening and repair methods are time and resource intensive, and quite often very intrusive. The proposed method however, uses composite laminates to increase the torsional capacity of concrete beams. Six identical spandrel beams were built and tested. Two of the beams were considered as baseline specimens, the remaining four were strengthened using three different composite laminates. In order to eliminate the flexural and shear forces on the beam, a close to pure twisting force was applied {{at the end of}} the beam specimen. In traditional cast-in-place construction the slab adjacent to the <b>spandrel</b> <b>beam</b> does not allow a complete wrap around the beam. To simulate this, the CFRP laminate was provided only on three sides of the beam, and special anchors were used to allow a continuous torsional shear flow around the specimens. The experiments showed that this method increased the torsional strength of the spandrel beams up to 113 %. Excessive concrete cracking followed by composite delamination caused the specimen failure. An equation was also developed which, for most of the specimens, accurately predicted the composite contribution. This analytical procedure was based on the existing information on the torsional resistance provided by closed stirrups, and on the equations developed to design the composite shear retrofit of RC beams...|$|E

The particular structures studied are a railway bridge and four multi-storey buildings: one with a tall flexible steel frame, two others with open reinforced concrete frames {{and the other a}} reinforced concrete <b>spandrel</b> <b>beam</b> frame. Calculations were made to determine the magnitudes of the plastic deformations which occur in these New Zealand structures under a strong motion earthquake, the N-S component of that recorded at El Centro in 1940. The development of computer programs to calculate the elastic and elasto-plastic response of multi-mass structures to recorded earthquakes and the numerical integration methods on which they are based are outlined. Efficient static analysis programs which may be used to calculate the individual member actions in a multi- storey frame, caused by the earthquake induced lateral forces are also developed. It was found that the lateral deflections assuming elasto-plastic behaviour were of the same order as those calculated assuming yielding did not occur. The plastic action tended to reduce the top storey deflection and increase the lower storey deflections. The member ductilities required by these frames were of reasonable magnitude and could probably be provided with adequate detailing, {{but it is clear that}} typical structures must be capable of providing member ductilities greater than four.

Spans for precast and prestressed concrete spandrel beams (or spandrels) are typically {{as long as}} 30 to 48 ft. In the near future, precasters might begin to produce spandrels with longer spans (up to 60 ft) and thinner webs (as little as 8 in.), which facilitate more cost-effective parking garages and advance the competitiveness of the precast concrete industry. However, there {{are likely to be}} spandrel dimensions beyond which excessive deformations make such designs unfeasible. In particular, lateral deformations developing at {{the top and bottom of}} a slender <b>spandrel</b> <b>beam</b> need to be investigated for short-term and long-term loading effects. Spandrels in parking garages typically support double-tee beams (or double tees) on ledges, spot corbels, or pockets, all of which introduce lateral eccentricity as the double tee loads are transferred to the spandrels. Upon connecting the spandrels to the double tees using deck ties, these connections serve as lateral restraints for the spandrels due to the axial stiffness of the deck ties. Thus, lateral deflection of the spandrel is prevented at the connection points. However, given that the deck ties are thin steel plates, they are unable to eliminate twisting of the spandrel section. Thus, subsequent deformation of the spandrel will include both vertical and lateral deflections. Excessive lateral deflections might cause undesirable serviceability problems in the structure or even collapse of the concrete deck. For this reason the study of lateral deflections is the focus of the research presented in this dissertation. Two approaches are pursued to study the lateral deflection response of the slender spandrels under static loads: analytical and computational. First, an approximate analytical solution for the lateral deflections of spandrels is presented. Next, the effects of various parameters on the results from finite element analyses are examined. This is followed by a detailed discussion of modeling suggestions under which computational results can be sufficiently reliable. The best possible modeling approach, deduced from such parametric studies, is used for a three-dimensional nonlinear finite element analysis of spandrels. Finally, time-dependent (long-term) lateral deflections in spandrels having various span lengths and cross sections are investigated...|$|E

Summary of Flexural Strength Of Reinforced Concrete Slabs With Externally Applied In-Plane Forces by Girolaml, A. G. : Reinforced concrete slabs, bounded by elements which can develop horizontal reactions, have flexural capacities considerably {{in excess of}} the load calculated by an orthodox application of the yield-line analysis. The additional capacity results primarily from changes in geometry of the slab which generates in-plane forces reacting against the bounding element. Calculation of the effect of the in-plane forces on slab flexural strength is essential for a realistic evaluation of the slab capacity because the increase in load caused by the in-plane forces is not negligible, especially for short-time loading. The investigation described in this report was concerned with the development of a simple method of calculation for the flexural {{strength of}} reinforced concrete slabs with in-plane forces and to check the applicability of the method by experiments. Six reinforced concrete slabs with <b>spandrel</b> <b>beams</b> were built, instrumented, and tested. The test slabs, which were six-ft square and 1. 75 in. deep, were reinforced with intermediate grade steel (yield stress was approximately 48, 000 psl) and the concrete strength was approximately 4500 :psl [...] The slab and the <b>spandrel</b> <b>beams</b> had both negative and positive moment reinforcement to stimulate an interior panel in a two-way slab designed to carry 150 psf. Three of the test slabs were supported only at the corners while three were supported at several points along the <b>spandrel</b> <b>beams</b> to investigate the effects of nonyielding beams [...] . Summary of Strength Of Slabs Subjected To Multiaxial Bending And Compression by Gamble, W. L. : Reinforced concrete slab panels which are supported so that horizontal displacement of the edges of the panels are prevented are often capable of supporting considerably more load than would be indicated by simple yield-line analysis methods because of in-plane compression forces developed during deflection. The purpose of the series of tests and analysis described in this report was to demonstrate that the basic principles used in predicting the strength of reinforced concrete elements subjected to bending moments and thrusts in one direction, {{as in the case of}} columns, can also be used satisfactorily to predict the strength and behavior of slabs subjected to bending and in-plane forces acting in several directions at once. The importance of the in-plane forces can perhaps be best illustrated by reference to a set of tests conducted by Ockleston on a large reinforced concrete building. A single interior beam-supported panel carried a uniformly distributed load of 753 psf. While the computed capacity, using the yield-line analysis technique, was 295 psf. The very high load capacity is attributable to the presence of –in-plane compression forces generated when the surrounding panels restrained the lateral movements of the edges of the load panel. Six hexagonal reinforced concrete slabs were constructed and tested in order to investigate the effects of the reinforcement ratio and magnitude of in-plane forces on the strength and behavior of slabs. The slabs were reinforced with steel having a yield stress of about 50 kips/in. ² and the average concrete strength was about 6, 300 1 b/in. ² The slabs were four in. thick, and the basic hexagon measure about 6 ft 2 in. across flats. The edges of the hexagon were slotted to form loading wings, and the load was applied so as to produce constant bending moments in all directions within a three ft diam. Central portion of the slab [...] . The Departmeent Of Defense Office Of The Secretary Of The Army, Office Of Civil Defense.

30|$|Most of the {{research}} is done on RC beams strengthened with FRP subjected to shear and flexure. Many structural members such as curved girders, space frames, eccentrically loaded <b>beams,</b> <b>spandrel</b> <b>beams</b> in buildings, and spiral staircases are subjected to torsional moment. Beyond plane rectangular nature, structural member can be of T shape, L shape or box section. These various shapes create difficulty in understanding torsion in RC members (Panchacharam and Belarbi 2002). Elwan (2017) worked on flanged beams retrofitted with FRP system subjected to torsional moment. Though shear and torsion both produced diagonal cracks in RC beam, behavior of RC beam subjected to torsion is different. Due to shear, crack propagates in the same direction on both sides of the beam, whereas due to torsion spiral cracks propagate {{in the opposite direction}} {{on opposite sides of the}} beam. Alabdulhady et al. (2017) used PBO-FRCM composites to improve torsional resistance of reinforced concrete beams. Zhang et al. (2001), Hii and Al-Mahaidi (2006), Jing et al. (2007), Mohammadizadeh and Fadeel (2009) and Deifalla et al. (2013) worked on the torsional behavior of different types of reinforced concrete beam externally strengthened with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP).|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} made of the free {{vibration}} of planar coupled shear walls, a common lateral load-resisting configuration in building construction where two walls are coupled together by a system of discrete <b>spandrel</b> <b>beams.</b> The differential equations and boundary conditions are obtained by the variational method, and by assuming that the spandrels can {{be replaced by a}} continuous system of laminae, or small beams. Natural frequencies and mode shapes are determined, and the results are presented in a number of figures from which the natural frequencies of any coupled shear wall can be extracted. The importance of including vertical displacement in the analysis is discussed, and a study of the effect of neglecting the vertical inertia term is given. These cases are illustrated with graphs and with one specific example. Investigations are also made of the asymptotic behavior of the system as the spandrels become weak, as they become stiff, and as the frequencies become large. Finally, the theory of sandwich beams is presented and compared to that for coupled shear walls. It is observed that for most cases of constant properties, the differential equations (and boundary conditions) reduce to the same mathematical form for both theories...|$|R
