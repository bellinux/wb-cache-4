The optimal utilization of network resources and the capacity to fulfill quality of service requirements are key requirements for 3 rd G networks operations. Several burst admission and scheduling algorithms were proposed in the literature but most focus on the use of continuous <b>service</b> <b>bit</b> rates. In this study, we modify two widely cited algorithms to utilize discrete <b>service</b> <b>bit</b> rates. The proposed algorithms, DEDF and DPEDF are compared against the original continuous bit rate counterparts in terms of network throughput, power utilization, and packet discard rate for typical 3 G network deployment parameters. Results indicate the use of discrete service rate reduces maximum network throughput and lowers the power utilization. Finally, the study also evaluates the effect of various packet delay thresholds on the overall performance of the network...|$|E

Short links are often included on printed materials so that people using mobile devices can quickly enter URLs. Although mobile transcription is a common use-case, link-shortening services generate output that is poorly suited to entry on mobile devices: links often contain numbers and capital letters that require time consuming mode switches on touch screen keyboards.

Taking into account the imperfections in power control for such CDMA systems, the effect of data transmission variability on the Erlang capacity of voice is analyzed (on the uplink case).

The main parts of end-to-end delay in a DVB-H system result from a time-sliced transmission scheme that is used in DVB-H and from the bit rate variations of <b>service</b> <b>bit</b> streams. The time-sliced transmission scheme is utilized in DVB-H to reduce the power consumption of DVB-H receivers. Variable bit rate (VBR) video bit streams are used in DVB-H to improve the video quality and compression performance. The time-sliced transmission scheme has increased the channel switching delay, i. e., switching to a new audio-visual service, in DVB-H. The used VBR bit streams increase the required buffering delays in the whole system. The different parts of end-to-end delay in a DVB-H system can be affected by the used video encoding and multiplexing methods. Different scenarios for encoding and StatMux of video sources for DVB-H application are studied in this paper. Moreover, a new method for jointly encoding and StatMux of video sources is proposed that not only decreases the end-to-end delay but also improves the average quality of compressed video by dynamically distributing available bandwidth between the video sources according to their relative complexity.

40|$|This paper investigates how Scalable Video Coding (SVC) {{can benefit}} from {{different}} Forward Error Correction (FEC) and transmission schemes in mobile broadcast systems. Simulation are performed in DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting - Handheld) systems. In DVB-H, a differentiation in robustness for the different SVC layers can be achieved at the link layer using intra-burst MPE-FEC (multi-Protocol Encapsulation FEC). The paper evaluates the gain {{that can be achieved}} with the MPE-FEC using equal (EEP) and unequal error protection (UEP), and the performance improvements of an SVC layer-aware FEC (LA-FEC) approach that can be implemented in DVB-H either at the link layer with MPE-iFEC (inter-burst MPE-FEC) or at the application layer with AL-FEC. LA-FEC improves the SVC base layer robustness generating parity information across existing dependencies within the SVC video coding structure. Laboratory measurement results using a TU 6 channel model show that the performance of an SVC service in DVB-H can be significantly increased by a proper link layer FEC scheme. It is shown that using SVC in combination with LA-FEC and a proper transmission scheduling does not only give a better performance in terms of PSNR and amount of video outages compared to a single layer service at the same <b>service</b> <b>bit</b> rate, but also gives an additional lower quality layer which can be used for applications like conditional access...|$|E

40|$|Multi-media {{integration}} of broadband {{services in a}} broadband satellite network is considered. Voice, data, video teleconferencing, and television with broad range of <b>service</b> (<b>bit)</b> rates are multiplexed through a broadband satellite, channel in a multiple-access fashion. Large (but finite) population sizes are considered with arrivals modeled by binomial distributions. A two-state minisource model is used for voice signals. For video, variable rate interframe coding is utilized to reduce the bandwidth requirements, and Markov phase processes model the modulation of the rates of the video teleconferencing and television signals. Among these services, video and voice are real-time signals and can not tolerate large random delays. In our attempt to satisfy this, video and voice use the Synchronous Transfer Mode (STM) with a frame structure, while the data users (with their bursty traffic) send (and retransmit, if necessary) their packets randomly within a frame. The video and voice users make their schedules in advance by using a pre- assigned slot (status slot). The first portion of a frame is assigned to the variable rate video users, while the variable rate voice users fill up the last portion of the frame. Data packets fill up the remaining slots between these two movable boundaries in a random-access fashion. In this protocol, the delay introduced by the satellite is taken into consideration. This multiple-access integration protocol is optimized with respect to performance measures, such as the blocking probabilities for voice and video, the average delay for data, and the average throughput for voice, video, and data...|$|E

Thesis work consists of two main parts, first an investigation and then a prototype. The investigation should be for a number of representative material systems (such as ships and artillery) examine whether and how the BIT error information can be extracted and transferred to the maintenance system.

Our online algorithm used to prove the upper bound is non pre-emptive no packet admitted to the buffer.
