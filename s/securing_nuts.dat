2500|$|When an oil {{metering}} unit was installed on a cabin pressurisation blower, locking wire {{was used to}} ensure the five <b>securing</b> <b>nuts</b> did not rotate and become loose. [...] In the wreckage of number 2 cabin blower accident investigators found none of the nuts and no locking wire. [...] The investigators believed that when the blower was last overhauled the oil {{metering unit}} may have been re-attached without locking wire securing the nuts. [...] The blower was overhauled and then installed on VH-RMI in April 1966.|$|E

50|$|A {{knurled nut}} is a nut with a knurled outside surface. This {{facilitates}} tightening by hand (thumb <b>nut)</b> or <b>secures</b> the <b>nut</b> in a substrate (insertion nut).|$|R
50|$|A pin shackle {{is closed}} with an anchor bolt and cotter pin, {{in a manner}} similar to a clevis. It is for this reason they are often {{referred}} to, in industrial jargon, as clevises. Pin shackles can be inconvenient to work with, at times, as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss, usually with a split pin or seizing wire. A more secure version used in crane rigging features the combination of a <b>securing</b> <b>nut</b> (hardware) located alongside the cotter pin. Pin shackles are practical in many rigging applications where the anchor bolt is expected to experience some rotation.|$|R
50|$|The 21064 is {{packaged}} in a 431-pin alumina-ceramic {{pin grid array}} (PGA) measuring 61.72 mm by 61.72 mm. Of the 431 pins, 291 were for signals and 140 were for power and ground. The heatsink is directly attached to the package, <b>secured</b> by <b>nuts</b> attached to two studs protruding from the tungsten heat spreader.|$|R
50|$|Twin {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} {{attached to the}} backplate via bolts, passing through the cylinder bands, and <b>secured</b> by <b>nuts</b> in the central channel of the backplate. An alternative is to use two sets of camstraps and extra slots in the backplate and wing. This arrangement will allow convenient attachment of independent cylinders of almost any size without use of cylinder bands.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{cross section}} and {{plan of the}} {{connection}} between water tubes and a water chamber in a Reed boiler. The spheroidal ferrules [...] "3" [...] are screwed onto the tubes, which are then inserted into holes in the water chamber wall that are of slightly larger diameter than the tubes; the tubes are then <b>secured</b> by <b>nuts</b> [...] "N" [...] {{on the inside of the}} chamber.|$|R
5000|$|The final Report on the {{investigation}} of the incident was published (only in German) on 21 March 2006 by the Air Accident Investigation Board (Flugunfalluntersuchungsstelle) of the Austrian Federal Office for Transport (Bundesanstalt für Verkehr, BAV). [...] The Report identified the cause of the failure of landing gear retraction as a minor oversight during maintenance; an inadequately <b>secured</b> lock <b>nut</b> allowed a screw to gradually turn, eventually leading to a 10 mm adjustment error that prevented complete retraction.|$|R
5000|$|Split pins are {{frequently}} used to secure other fasteners, e.g. clevis pins, {{as well as}} being used in combination with hardboard discs as a traditional joining technique for teddy bears. A common application of this is when used to <b>secure</b> a castellated <b>nut.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Axle {{bolt and nut}}: The {{axle bolt}} locates the wheel into the caster yoke. The <b>nut</b> <b>secures</b> the axle to the yoke. In some {{applications}} the axle bolt and nut may be hardened or zinc plated for corrosion resistance. Stainless steel may occasionally be used.|$|R
2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{discovered that}} a couple of years earlier, fires had occurred in one of the cabin pressurisation blowers on a Vickers Viscount in Canada and another in the British West Indies. [...] Both fires broke out after loosening of the <b>nuts</b> <b>securing</b> the oil metering unit to the blower. [...] Both occurred during testing of the engine on the ground. [...] At the time, the blower manufacturer was not advised. [...] It was not until the crash of Flight 149 in Australia that the blower manufacturer became aware of the need for these cabin pressurisation blowers to be modified.|$|R
50|$|A {{wire rope}} clamp, also called a clip, {{is used to}} fix the loose end of the loop back to the wire rope. It usually {{consists}} of a U-shaped bolt, a forged saddle, and two nuts. The two layers of wire rope are placed in the U-bolt. The saddle is then fitted over the ropes on to the bolt (the saddle includes two holes to fit to the u-bolt). The <b>nuts</b> <b>secure</b> the arrangement in place. Three or more clamps are usually used to terminate a wire rope. As many as eight may be needed for a 2 in diameter rope.|$|R

50|$|Tuning screws are screws {{inserted}} into resonant cavities {{which can be}} adjusted externally to the waveguide. They provide fine tuning of the resonant frequency by inserting more, or less thread into the waveguide. Examples {{can be seen in}} the post filter of figure 1: each cavity has a tuning screw <b>secured</b> with jam <b>nuts</b> and thread-locking compound. For screws inserted only a small distance, the equivalent circuit is a shunt capacitor, increasing in value as the screw is inserted. However, when the screw has been inserted a distance λ/4 it resonates equivalent to a series LC circuit. Inserting it further causes the impedance to change from capacitive to inductive, that is, the arithmetic sign changes.|$|R

50|$|Box {{connectors}} join conduit to a {{junction box}} or other electrical box. A typical box connector is inserted into a knockout in a junction box, with the threaded end then being secured with a ring (called a lock nut) {{from within the}} box, as a bolt would be <b>secured</b> by a <b>nut.</b> The {{other end of the}} fitting usually has a screw or compression ring which is tightened down onto the inserted conduit. Fittings for non-threaded conduits are either secured with set screws or with a compression nut that encircles the conduit. Fittings for general purpose use with metal conduits may be made of die-cast zinc, but where stronger fittings are needed, they are made of copper-free aluminum or cast iron.|$|R
5000|$|Frangible <b>nuts</b> <b>secured</b> {{the solid}} rocket {{boosters}} (SRB) {{of the space}} shuttle, which were bolted to the mobile launcher platform (MLP) until liftoff. On the shuttle, they were separated using a NASA standard detonator or NSD. The space shuttle used two NSDs for the frangible nut atop {{each of the four}} 28" [...] long, 3.5" [...] diameter bolts holding each SRB to the MLP. Once detonation occurred, the shuttle lifted free of the MLP. The broken nut and any shrapnel from detonation was captured by energy absorption material, such as metal foam, to prevent damage to the shuttle. In case of NSD failure, or incomplete clearance of the nut from the bolt, the SRB had ample thrust to break the bolt itself and launch unhindered.|$|R
50|$|At 7:06 p.m. on April 27 (0006 UTC on April 28), a weak tornado {{touched down}} in extreme western Pulaski County, Arkansas, roughly 6 mi east of Paron, and tracked north-northeast. Within a minute, the tornado {{dramatically}} intensified and struck a small residential area at EF3 intensity. There, two homes were destroyed and another was severely damaged. One {{of the homes}} was built with bolts along the foundation perimeter and {{was reduced to a}} bare slab, normally indicative of EF5 strength; however, {{it was found that the}} anchor bolts were not <b>secured</b> with <b>nuts</b> and washers, and nearby vehicles were not moved, which indicated a lesser intensity. Three people were killed in that area. The storm weakened as it turned more northeasterly and moved through a forested area. Damage to trees and homes in this area was rated EF1. At 7:14 p.m. (0014 UTC), it struck Northpoint as an EF2, causing severe damage to several homes. Roofs were removed entirely from homes, though the walls on these structures remained mostly intact. After briefly crossing Lake Maumelle, the tornado caused significant tree damage between Roland and Natural Steps with some trees being stripped of their foliage and debarked. Moving through an unpopulated area, the tornado intensified before crossing the Arkansas River and entering Faulkner County around 7:26 p.m. (0026 UTC).|$|R
2500|$|In the Normand boiler, {{the tubes}} were {{comparatively}} straight and {{a portion of}} those in the inner and outer rows of each bank were formed into [...] "tube walls" [...] to direct hot gases generated by the furnace through the boiler. In the Reed boiler, the tubes were bent into pronounced curves of varying radii to maximise surface area and therefore steam production, and baffles were used to direct hot gases. Further, the external diameter of the tubes tapered at their lower ends from inches (27mm) to inch (22mm) to improve the passage of hot gases between them. They were connected perpendicularly to the chambers at each end, as were the tubes in the Normand boiler, to reduce stress. However, in the Reed boiler these connections were made by hemispherical faces, which allowed [...] "a certain angular play". The tubes were <b>secured</b> by <b>nuts</b> inside the chambers at each end. Handholes gave access to the bottom chambers, and a manhole gave access to the top chamber. In both types of boiler, the tubes joined the top chamber below the designed water line to stop them overheating, and large, external [...] "down-comer" [...] tubes transferred water from the top chamber to the two bottom ones. The down-comers thus promoted convection within the boiler, which needed to be rapid because of the small diameter of the tubes, and formed [...] "a substantial part of [...] framework." ...|$|R
5000|$|In its classic form, {{the guitar}} is simply constructed, with {{the neck and}} {{fingerboard}} comprising {{a single piece of}} maple, screwed to an ash or alder body inexpensively jigged with flat surfaces on the front and back. The hardware includes two single coil pickups controlled by a three-way selector switch, and one each of volume and tone controls. The pickguard was first Bakelite, soon thereafter it was celluloid (later other plastics), screwed directly onto the body with five (later eight) screws. The bridge has three adjustable saddles, with strings doubled up on each. In its original design nearly all components are secured using only screws (body, neck, tuners, bridge, scratchplate, pickups to body, control plate, output socket), with glue used to <b>secure</b> the <b>nut</b> and solder used to connect the electronic components. With the introduction of the truss rod, and later a rosewood fingerboard, more gluing was required during construction. The guitar quickly gained a following, and soon other, more established guitar companies (such as Gibson, whose Les Paul model was introduced in 1952, and later Gretsch, Rickenbacker, and others) began working on wooden solid-body production models of their own.A huge range of aftermarket components are manufactured, including bridges with three vintage-look brass saddles, compensated (by having two separate string separation points on each saddle) to improve intonation. There are also [...] "vertical stack" [...] humbucker pickups which fit into a standard bridge in place of the traditional single-coil units and maintain the original appearance.|$|R
50|$|The Israeli UZI sub-machinegun {{was taken}} as a basis, and several {{technical}} solutions of such weapon were outright adopted, including the telescoping bolt (already in use in another Italian sub-machinegun, the Beretta PM-12), the safety/fire selector switch and the grip safety, and housing of the magazine in the pistol grip. However, SOCIMI/Franchi engineers wanted to distinguish their weapon from the original UZI, by developing {{a wide array of}} newer features.The SOCIMI sub-machinegun was built around a solid, monolythic rectangular receiver made out of one single piece of lightweight alloy, departing from the UZI's heavy stamped steel receiver design; the SOCIMI receiver has one single opening on the rear from which the entire bolt assembly can be extracted, while the barrel is inserted in the front and <b>secured</b> by a <b>nut,</b> and can be separated from the receiver by unscrewing it like in the UZI. The grip has finger grooves for better handling.|$|R
5000|$|The {{double-action}} revolver design {{introduced by}} Dan Wesson {{was invented by}} Karl R. Lewis. [...] Lewis was responsible {{for a number of}} new firearms designs while working for various firearms manufacturers, including the Army's 40mm break-open grenade launcher and the [...]357 caliber Colt Trooper revolver. Lewis had previously invented an interchangeable barrel system for revolvers, and this system was incorporated into the Dan Wesson prototype. While nearly all revolvers are constructed with a barrel screwed tightly to a frame (which must be removed and installed by an experienced gunsmith), Lewis' idea was to house the barrel tube within a separate shroud <b>secured</b> by a <b>nut</b> at the muzzle, which places tension on the barrel and provides support {{at both ends of the}} barrel. By unscrewing the muzzle nut, the shroud and barrel could be removed and replaced with different barrel lengths and shroud configurations. The fact that the DW barrel is supported and placed under tension at both ends (along with the ability to fine-tune barrel-cylinder gap) resulted in markedly increased accuracy over conventional revolver designs.|$|R
40|$|A lifting fixture {{has been}} {{designed}} to handle the Samus counters. These counters are being removed from the D-zero area and will be transported off site for further use at another facility. This fixture is designed specifically for this particular application and will be transferred along with the counters. The future use of these counters may entail installation at a facility without access to a crane and therefore a lift fixture suitable for both crane and/or fork lift usage has been created The counters weigh approximately 3000 lbs. and have threaded rods extended through the counter at the top comers for lifting. When these counters were first handled/installed these rods were used in conjunction with appropriate slings and handled by crane. The rods are <b>secured</b> with <b>nuts</b> tightened against the face of the counter. The rod thread is M 16 x 2 ({approx}. 625 -inch dia.) and extends 2 -inch (on average) {{from the face of the}} counter. It is this cantilevered rod that the lift fixture engages with 'C' style plates at the four top comers. The strongback portion of the lift fixture is a steel rectangular tube 8 -inch (vertical) x 4 -inch x. 25 -inch wall, 130 -inch long. 1. 5 -inch square bars are welded perpendicular to the long axis of the rectangular tube at the appropriate lift points and the 'C' plates are fastened to these bars with 3 / 4 - 10 high strength bolts -grade 8. Two short channel sections are positioned-welded-to the bottom of the rectangular tube on 40 feet centers, which are used as locators for fork lift tines. On the top are lifting eyes for sling/crane usage and are rated at 3500 lbs. safe working load each - vertical lift only...|$|R
2500|$|The {{investigation}} eventually {{determined that}} the rotors in the cabin pressurisation blower on number 2 engine began to break up, resulting in severe vibration that loosened the <b>nuts</b> <b>securing</b> the oil metering unit to the blower and allowed oil to escape freely. [...] The rear bearing {{of one of the}} rotors also came free, so the rotor gyrated, causing metal-to-metal contact and great heat. [...] The blower was located aft of the firewall, and a fire started {{in the rear of the}} nacelle when the escaping oil was ignited by contact with the hot metal in the damaged blower. The fire burned the engine control rods, preventing feathering of the propeller. [...] Burning oil flowed into the wheel bay and from there into the leading edge of the left wing, where the fire breached the wall of a fuel tank. The abundant supply of fuel caused the fire to spread throughout much of the left wing and become so intense it caused softening of aluminium alloy and loss of strength of the upper boom (or upper flange) in the wing spar. The spar was critically weakened in the region between number 1 and 2 engines.|$|R
5000|$|Traxxas's first RTR Nitro truck. The Traxxas' Nitro Hawk, though {{already a}} legacy model, is highly {{collectible}} {{and are still}} being sold at toy auctions till this time. The highest recorded bid, in 2011, sold for $360.00, {{much more than the}} price of a new one.The Traxxas Nitro Hawk was a two-wheel drive stadium truck with an all-aluminum chassis that came with four different engines, the Image [...]12, the TRX12, TRX15 and Pro15 in a special long crankshaft configuration. The engine assembly was different from other traxxas models, having the clutch bell with the pinion facing against the engine, and the flywheel <b>secured</b> with a <b>nut</b> {{at the end of the}} crank with the clutch shoes facing inward. Another particularity was its shoe brake system that applied braking force on the clutch bell itself instead of having a brake disc mounted on the transmission. This truck also featured all-aluminum shocks with collars to adjust spring load and 2.2-inch lite dish wheels with pro trax ribbed tires at the front and spiked ones at the back. Common upgrades were the 360 Stinger exhaust and sturdier shock towers, since the stock fiber ones were soft.First editions had white plastic parts, body and a clear/transparent hard plastic top, purposely to be painted with the hobbyist-preferred color and are the most collectable ones.|$|R
