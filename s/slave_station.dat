50|$|When a {{transmission}} medium is half duplex (that is, it can transmit {{in only one}} direction at a time), there is usually a master station that can transmit at any time, and one or more slave stations that transmit when they have permission. The enquire character (ENQ) is generally used by a master station to ask a <b>slave</b> <b>station</b> to send its next message. A <b>slave</b> <b>station</b> indicates that it has completed its transmission by sending the {{end of transmission character}} (EOT).|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} idea of orbit determination called "determination of satellite orbit by transfer" was {{proposed by the}} National Time Service Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences. It shows {{that the system is}} very stable and the orbit determination accuracy is improved greatly. A new observation mode called "differenced ranges between master <b>station</b> and <b>slave</b> <b>stations</b> by transfer" is introduced. It is the development of "determination of satellite orbit by transfer". In principle, the differenced ranges between master <b>station</b> and <b>slave</b> <b>stations</b> have a high angular resolution, and strongly constrains in the transverse direction of satellite orbit, perpendicular to the line-of-sight. The principle of "differenced ranges between master <b>station</b> and <b>slave</b> <b>stations</b> by transfer" is discussed in detail. And differenced ranges in combination with ranging data were used to determine satellite&# 39;s orbit and orbit prediction under different arc observations. It shows that orbit determination accuracy for orbit prediction can be improved with differenced ranges in combination with ranging data...|$|R

The stability of each Loran-C frequency standard transmission is subject to perturbations, more or less known, due to the propagation medium and other causes.

5000|$|The Gee {{signal for}} any given chain {{consisted}} {{of a series of}} pulses of radio signal with a roughly inverted-parabolic envelope about 6 microseconds in duration. The master sent a single pulse, referred to as [...] "A", followed 2 ms later by a double pulse, [...] "D". These were used to identify the start and end of the broadcast cycle. The first <b>slave</b> <b>station</b> sent a single pulse 1 ms after the master's single pulse, labeled [...] "B", and the second slave sent a single pulse 1 ms after the master's double pulse, labeled [...] "C". The whole sequence repeated on a 4 ms cycle, with the pattern [...] "ABD... ACD... ABD..." [...] The triggering of the A pulses was timed at 150 kHz by a local oscillator at the master station, and was sometimes deliberately changed.|$|E
50|$|Gee {{was highly}} {{susceptible}} to jamming {{since all the}} Germans {{had to do was}} radiate spurious pulses that made it impossible to determine which was a real signal from the slave and which was being broadcast from a jammer. This could be easily arranged by locating another <b>slave</b> <b>station</b> in France or the Netherlands and modifying its delay and signal strength for its signals to appear to be similar to those from one of the stations in the UK. This worked only over Germany; when aircraft flying over the UK the signal would appear too weak. Using conventional radio receivers and loop antennas for direction finding, radio operators could determine which of the signals was false. However even if jammed over enemy territory, Gee had the extremely useful advantage of providing a reliable navigational 'fix' once homeward aircraft were over the North Sea on return from operations, making it easier for returning bombers to find their airfields with a resultant reduction in losses due to accidents.|$|E

50|$|It was phase {{comparison}} at {{this common}} frequency {{that resulted in}} the hyperbolic lines of position. The interval between two adjacent hyperbolas on which the signals are in phase was called a lane. Since the wavelength of the common frequency was small compared with the distance between the Master and <b>Slave</b> <b>stations</b> there were many possible lines of position for a given phase difference, and so a unique position could not be arrived at by this method.|$|R

The assignment of master status to a given station is temporary and is controlled by the control station according to the procedures set forth in the operational protocol.
