50|$|Rotation is now {{a common}} feature of modern video cards, and is widely used in tablet PCs (many tablet devices can sense the {{direction}} of gravity and automatically rotate the image), and by writers, layout artists, etc. Operating systems and drivers do not always support it; for example, Windows XP Service Pack 3 conflicts with monitor rotation on many graphics cards using ATI's Catalyst control software, Nvidia's proprietary drivers for Linux do not <b>support</b> <b>screen</b> rotation unless manual changes are made to its configuration.|$|E

5000|$|Support {{for video}} in SWF file format was added in Flash Player 6, {{released}} in 2002. In 2003, Flash Player 7 added direct support for FLV file format. Because of restrictions in the FLV file format, Adobe Systems has created in 2007 new file formats listed below, {{based on the}} ISO base media file format (MPEG-4 Part 12). Flash Player does not check {{the extension of the}} file, but rather looks inside the file to detect which format it is. The new file formats are completely different from the older FLV file format. For example, F4V does not <b>support</b> <b>Screen</b> video, Sorenson Spark, VP6 video compression formats and ADPCM, Nellymoser audio compression formats. Authors of Flash Player strongly encourage everyone to embrace the new standard file format F4V (ISO base media file format). There are functional limits with the FLV structure when streaming H.264 or AAC which could not be overcome without a redesign of the file format. This is one reason why Adobe Systems is moving away from the traditional FLV file structure. Initial format since 2002 is Flash Video, file suffix is [...]flv with a MIME derived Internet media type of video/x-flv.|$|E
