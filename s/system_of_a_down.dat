5000|$|Critical {{reception}} to Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses {{was generally}} positive. It received <b>a</b> score <b>of</b> 70% on review aggregator Metacritic based on 12 reviews. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic called the album [...] "not just another flashy alt-metal billboard", praising the bands [...] "dedication to {{making it a}} Slipknot album". Todd Burns of Stylus wrote that people who accuse the band of having [...] "softened" [...] are [...] "mistaking softness for maturation". Burns went on to call the album [...] "the best pop inflected metal album since <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Downs</b> Toxicity".

5|$|Lavigne's earlier {{influences}} {{came from}} country music acts such as Garth Brooks, the Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain; and alternative singer-songwriters such as Alanis Morissette, Lisa Loeb, Natalie Imbruglia and Janis Joplin. By {{the time she}} left school to focus on her music career, Lavigne was musically more influenced by skate punk, pop punk and punk rock acts such as blink-182, Sum 41, NOFX, Pennywise, Dashboard Confessional, Green Day, the Ramones, the Distillers and Hole. She also enjoyed metal bands such as Marilyn Manson, <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Down,</b> Incubus and the Used; as well as alternative bands such as Nirvana, No Doubt, the Goo Goo Dolls, Radiohead, Coldplay, Oasis, Third Eye Blind and Matchbox Twenty.|$|E
5|$|Many musicians, {{bands and}} orchestras from diverse genres have been {{influenced}} by Zappa's music. Rock artists like Alice Cooper, Larry LaLonde of Primus, Fee Waybill of the Tubes all cite Zappa's influence, as do progressive, alternative and experimental rock artists like Can, Pere Ubu, Henry Cow, Trey Anastasio of Phish, Jeff Buckley, Faust, John Frusciante, Steven Wilson, and The Aristocrats. Paul McCartney regarded Sgt.

On the classical music scene, Tomas Ulrich, Meridian Arts Ensemble, Ensemble Ambrosius and the Fireworks Ensemble regularly perform Zappa's compositions and quote his influence. Contemporary jazz musicians and composers Bill Frisell and John Zorn are inspired by Zappa, as is funk legend George Clinton.|$|E

30|$|The other subthemes were {{investigated}} assuming that their {{results would be}} implemented in the robotic technology proposed by the Lim laboratory. In the spaces where humans and robots cooperate or coexist, humans are always exposed {{to the risk of}} collision, robots falling over, and mechanical and electrical malfunctions in the robots. To improve human safety, robots should be designed differently. In this research, a passive collision force suppression mechanism was designed and developed to reduce collisions. If the control <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> robot breaks <b>down</b> owing to software faults or the loss of electrical power, the suppression mechanism must be able to reduce impact and contact force passively.|$|R
50|$|Gridiron {{football}} {{developed in}} the late 19th century out of the original games now known as rugby football and association football. It is distinguished from other football codes by its use of hard plastic helmets and shoulder pads, the forward pass, the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>downs,</b> <b>a</b> line <b>of</b> scrimmage, more specialist positions and formations, free substitution, platooning of different players for offense and defense, measurements in yards, a distinctive brown leather ball in the shape <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prolate spheroid with pointed ends, {{and the ability to}} score points while not in possession of the ball by way of the safety. Walter Camp is credited with creating many of the rules that differentiate gridiron football from its older counterparts.|$|R
40|$|Airborne {{dust and}} methane are common {{problems}} in the underground coalmines. They pose health and safety risk to mining personnel, and a safety risk to mining equipment as well. In order to prevent these risks air borne dust and methane concentrations must be reduced to within the acceptable levels. In South Africa, the dust and methane concentration in coalmines should not exceed 2. 0 mg/m³ and 0. 5 % per volume, respectively. Mine ventilation {{is one of the}} popular ways of controlling both dust and methane. Different ventilation systems have been designed since the history of underground coal mining. Unfortunately, none provides ultimate solution to the dust and methane problem, especially in the most critical areas of the underground coalmine, like blind-end of the heading and last through road. By changing airflow patterns and air velocity, it is possible to obtain an optimum ventilation design that can keep dust and methane within the acceptable levels. Since {{it is very difficult to}} conduct experiments in the underground coalmine due to harsh environmental conditions and tight production schedules, the designer made use of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling technique. The models were then experimentally verified and validated using <b>a</b> scaled <b>down</b> model at University of Pretoria. After verification further numerical analysis was done to in order to device a method for determining optimum fan positions for different heading dimensions. This study proves that CFD can be used to model ventilation <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scaled <b>down</b> coalmine model. Therefore chances that this might be true for the actual mine are very high but it needs to be investigated. If this is found to be true then CFD modelling will be a very useful tool in coalmine ventilation system research and development. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|Wheel and {{underbody}} aerodynamics {{become increasingly}} important as the demand on road vehicles increases. With limitations in allowable CO 2 emissions, reducing fuel consumption on passenger cars is essential {{in order to stay}} competitive. One important feature of wheel aerodynamics is the rim design which has been investigated in detail in this study. In order to explore wheel aerodynamics, a module-based prototype rim system was designed and implemented on full scale passenger cars. The module based <b>system</b> consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> slimmed <b>down</b> basic aluminum rim with add-on modules manufactured by SLS rapid prototyping. Stationary rim shields similar to what are used in Grand Prix racing was also studied in the research. Comprehensive investigations were performed in the Volvo Aerodynamic Wind Tunnel on a Volvo V 70 and S 80 respectively. Global force measurements were performed on all configurations along with base pressure measurements. A probe rake with two Omniprobes was used for local flow field investigations around the front right wheel. Results show that rim parameters such as location and size of rim openings have large influence on the aerodynamic performance of passenger cars. Good indications of important areas of the rim to cover for low drag were achieved. Stationary rim shields showed good potential in further reducing drag for passenger cars. Opening positions and shield gaps towards the rotating rims were found to have noticeable influence on aerodynamics. The local flow field investigation showed that the front wheel wake structures were significantly affected by different rim designs. A qualitative agreement between reduced ground wake and lower overall aerodynamic drag was observed. Additional possible mechanisms for aerodynamic drag reduction due to rim design and stationary rim shields are discussed...|$|R
