50|$|A {{headstock}} of a {{rail vehicle}} is a transverse structural member {{located at the}} extreme end <b>of</b> the vehicle's <b>underframe.</b> The headstock supports the coupling at that end of the vehicle, and may also support buffers, in which case {{it may also be}} known as a buffer beam. The headstocks form part <b>of</b> the <b>underframe</b> <b>of</b> a locomotive or a railroad car. The headstocks of locomotives, railcars and cabcars also support headlamps and the hoses for air brakes, vacuum brakes as well as the cables for train control and head end power.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: To {{ensure the}} safe and {{efficient}} {{operation of the}} approximately 1. 6 million freight cars (wagons) in the North American railroad network, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) requires periodic inspection of railcars to detect structural damage and defects. Railcar structural underframe components, including the centre sill, sidesills, and crossbearers, are subject to fatigue cracking due to periodic and/or cyclic loading during service {{and other forms of}} damage. The current railcar inspection process is time-consuming and relies heavily on the acuity, knowledge, skill, and endurance of qualified inspection personnel to detect these defects. Consequently, technologies are under development to automate critical inspection tasks to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. Research was conducted to determine the feasibility <b>of</b> inspecting railcar <b>underframe</b> components using machine vision technology. A digital video system was developed to record images <b>of</b> railcar <b>underframes</b> and computer software was developed to identify components and assess their condition. Tests of the image recording system were conducted at several railroad maintenance facilities. The images collected there were used to develop several types of machine vision algorithms to analyse images <b>of</b> railcar <b>underframes</b> and assess the condition of certai...|$|R

40|$|There {{the purpose}} is to develop the {{technique}} of theoretical prediction of dynamic properties of rolling stock for the estimation of efficiency of measures, which were directed for the decrease of rate of low-frequency bending vibrations of bodies. The mathematical simulator <b>of</b> generalized rail <b>underframe</b> has been developed. The conditions of asymptotic and unlimited stability of parametric bending vibrations of body have been formulated.

3000|$|As a {{critical}} component of the railway vehicle, underframe equipment has a great influence on the ride comfort of railway vehicles due to their big mass and active vibration. Therefore, study on the relationship between suspension parameters <b>of</b> <b>underframe</b> equipment and the modal frequency of carbody is extremely crucial for controlling the ride quality of railway vehicles. In this paper, a finite element model of the carbody was developed to investigate the effects of the suspension location, the mass of the suspension equipment, and the suspension frequency on the mode of the carbody. Then, the matching relationship between the suspension parameters and the modal frequency of the carbody was studied through the transfer function. In addition, roller rig tests were performed to verify the numerical simulation model of the carbody. The results show that the suspension parameters <b>of</b> the <b>underframe</b> equipment have a great influence on the mode of the carbody, especially for the frequency of the first bending mode. To improve the frequency of carbody high-frequency bending and reduce energy transfer, equipment with a large mass should be suspended toward the middle of the carbody. The weight of the equipment strongly affects the first bending frequency and energy transfer of the carbody. The frequency of heavy suspended equipment should be sufficiently low to increase the transmissibility of high frequencies and improve the vibration characteristics of the carbody. Although the bending frequency of the carbody can be improved effectively by increasing the suspension stiffness of the suspension equipment, in order to reduce carbody vibration effectively, the suspension frequency of the equipment should be slightly lower than the carbody bending frequency.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{fatigue crack}} {{initiated}} at an <b>underframe</b> <b>of</b> electric multiple unit (EMU) will be propagated unless appropriate maintenance {{is applied to}} stop it. To railway operating company, {{it is very important}} to know the critical crack size in vehicle structure under normal operating condition and how fast an initial crack reaches the critical crack to set up periodic maintenance strategy. In this research, we calculate the critical crack size and crack growth rate of a cracked EMU underframe by applying fracture mechanics. For this purpose, we build a FE model of an EMU carbody and verify it by comparing the deformations along the sidesill which are obtained by FE analysis and physical load test. Virtual cracks are modeled at weak points in the centersill and sidesill <b>of</b> <b>underframe.</b> The stress intensity factors are calculated under the normal operating condition and they are compared with fracture toughness of the material. Although, the applied stress intensity factors are not reach the fracture toughness of material, the safety margin is not big on a/W= 0. 8 crack in sidesill. Crack growth rate is predicted with measured the dynamic stress amplitude at the critical point during test run in commercial railroad track and crack growth curve of carbody material. It takes 7. 6 years (HAZ) and 4. 6 years (PWHT) for an initial crack of 30 mm to grow up to the critical crack. We expect that this approach will be helpful when railway operating companies set up their maintenance strategies...|$|R

To research {{the relationship between the}} suspension of equipment and carbody modes, we consider just one device. Some basic laws are then acquired by analyzing the influence of different suspension parameters on the carbody modes.|$|R
