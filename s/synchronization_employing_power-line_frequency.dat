A permanent criterion for finding linear segments in ECG is used {{and a new}} modification of the linear criterion is introduced that retains needed features for non-multiple sampling.

The in vitro studies on the adverse effects of EMF on human cells have not yielded a clear conclusion. In this study, we investigated whether <b>power-line</b> <b>frequency</b> EMF could act as an environmental insult to invoke stress responses in human keratinocytes using the 27 -kDa heat shock protein (HSP 27) as a stress marker. After exposure to 1 gauss (100 µT) EMF from 20 min to 24 hr, the isoform pattern of HSP 27 in keratinocytes remained unchanged, suggesting that EMF did not induce the phosphorylation of this stress protein. EMF exposure also failed to induce the translocation of HSP 27 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Moreover, EMF exposure did not increase the abundance of HSP 27 in keratinocytes. In addition, we {{found no evidence that}} EMF exposure enhanced the level of the 70 -kDa heat shock protein (HSP 70) in breast or leukemia cells as reported previously.

A double Vaseline-gap voltage clamp was used to deliver shock pulses and to monitor the channel currents. Three pairs of 4 -ms shock pulses were used to mimic the electric shock by a <b>power-line</b> <b>frequency</b> electric field. Each pair consists of two pulses with the same magnitude, starting from 350 to 500 mV, but with opposite polarities. The shock pulse-generated transmembrane ion flux and the responding electric energy, the Joule heating, consumed in the cell membrane, as well as the effects on the K+ channel currents, were obtained. Results showed that huge transmembrane currents are not necessary to cause damages in the K+ channel proteins. In contrast, reductions in the K+ channel currents are directly related to the field-induced supramembrane potential differences. By a comparison with the shock field-induced Joule heating effects on cell membranes, the field-induced supramembrane potential difference plays a dominant role in damaging the K+ channels, resulting in electroconformational changes in the membrane proteins.

50|$|Gifford-McMahon (GM) coolers {{have found}} {{widespread}} application in many low-temperature systems; e.g., in MRI and cryopumps. Fig. 5 is a schematic diagram. Helium at pressures in the 10 to 30 bar range is the working fluid. The cold head contains a compression and expansion space, a regenerator, and a displacer. Usually the regenerator and the displacer are combined in one body. The pressure {{variations in the}} cold head are obtained by connecting it periodically to the high- and low-pressure sides of a compressor by a rotating valve. Its position is synchronized with {{the motion of the}} displacer. During the opening and closing of the valves irreversible processes take place, so GM-coolers have intrinsic losses. This is a clear disadvantage of this type of cooler. The advantage is that the cycle frequencies of the compressor and the displacer are uncoupled so that the compressor can run at <b>power-line</b> <b>frequency</b> (50 or 60 Hz) while the cycle of the cold head is 1 Hz. In this way the swept volume of the compressor can be 50 (60) times smaller than of the cooler. Basically (cheap) compressors of domestic refrigerators can be used, but one must prevent overheating of the compressor as it is not designed for helium. One must also prevent oil vapor from entering the regenerator by high-quality purification traps.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Public access defibrillators (PADs) are now {{available}} for more efficient and rapid treatment of out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest. PADs are used normally by untrained {{people on the streets}} and in sports centers, airports, and other public areas. Therefore, automated detection of ventricular fibrillation, or its exclusion, is of high importance. A special case exists at railway stations, where electric <b>power-line</b> <b>frequency</b> interference is significant. Many countries, especially in Europe, use 16. 7 Hz AC power, which introduces high level frequency-varying interference that may compromise fibrillation detection. Method Moving signal averaging is often used for 50 / 60 Hz interference suppression if its effect on the ECG spectrum has little importance (no morphological analysis is performed). This approach may be also applied to the railway situation, if the interference frequency is continuously detected so as to synchronize the analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) for introducing variable inter-sample intervals. A better solution consists of rated ADC, software frequency measuring, internal irregular re-sampling according to the interference frequency, and a moving average over a constant sample number, followed by regular back re-sampling. Results The proposed method leads to a total railway interference cancellation, together with suppression of inherent noise, while the peak amplitudes of some sharp complexes are reduced. This reduction has negligible effect on accurate fibrillation detection. Conclusion The method is developed in the MATLAB environment and represents a useful tool for real time railway interference suppression. </p...|$|R

In early TV systems, a master voltage-controlled oscillator was run at twice the horizontal line frequency, and this frequency was divided down by the number of lines used (in this case 525) to give the field frequency (60 Hz in this case). This frequency was then compared with the 60 Hz <b>power-line</b> <b>frequency</b> and any discrepancy corrected by adjusting the frequency of the master oscillator. For interlaced scanning, an odd number of lines per frame was required in order to make the vertical retrace distance identical for the odd and even fields, which meant the master oscillator frequency had to be divided down by an odd number.At the time, the only practical method of frequency division was the use of a chain of vacuum tube multivibrators, the overall division ratio being the mathematical product of the division ratios of the chain. Since all the factors of an odd number also have to be odd numbers, it follows that all the dividers in the chain also had to divide by odd numbers, and these had to be relatively small due to the problems of thermal drift with vacuum tube devices.

40|$|Abstract Background Modern {{biomedical}} amplifiers have a {{very high}} common mode rejection ratio. Nevertheless, recordings are often contaminated by residual power-line interference. Traditional analogue and digital filters are known to suppress ECG components near to the <b>power-line</b> <b>frequency.</b> Different types of digital notch filters are widely used despite their inherent contradiction: tolerable signal distortion needs a narrow frequency band, which leads to ineffective filtering in cases of larger frequency deviation of the interference. Adaptive filtering introduces unacceptable transient response time, especially after steep and large QRS complexes. Other available techniques such as Fourier transform do not work in real time. The subtraction procedure is found to cope better with this problem. Method The subtraction procedure was developed some two decades ago, and almost totally eliminates power-line interference from the ECG signal. This procedure does not affect the signal frequency components around the interfering frequency. Digital filtering is applied on linear segments of the signal to remove the interference components. These interference components are stored and further subtracted from the signal wherever non-linear segments are encountered. Results Modifications of the subtraction procedure have been used in thousands of ECG instruments and computer-aided systems. Other work has extended this procedure to almost all possible cases of sampling rate and interference frequency variation. Improved structure of the on-line procedure has worked successfully regardless of the multiplicity between the sampling rate and the interference frequency. Such flexibility is due to the use of specific filter modules. Conclusion The subtraction procedure has largely proved advantageous over other methods for power-line interference cancellation in ECG signals. </p...|$|R

Occipital EEG spectral power was computed in the alpha range (8 - 12 [*]Hz, reportedly the most sensitive to MF exposure in the literature) with/without exposure. Brain functional activation was studied using fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD, inversely correlated with EEG alpha power) maps. No significant effects were detected on occipital EEG alpha power during or post-exposure for any exposure condition. Consistent with EEG results, no effects were observed on fMRI BOLD maps in any brain region. Our results suggest that acute exposure (2 - 10 [*]s) to 60 [*]Hz MF from 3 to 7. 6 [*]mT (30, 000 to 76, 000 times higher than average public exposure levels for 60 [*]Hz MF) does not induce detectable changes in EEG or BOLD signals.
