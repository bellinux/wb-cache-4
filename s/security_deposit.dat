5|$|The {{alliance}} {{celebrated its}} first anniversary in August 2016 {{with a new}} joint operations center and continued growth in traffic, despite a drop in shipping caused by slower growth in Asia. Later that month, Hanjin Shipping, a major operator in Seattle, filed for bankruptcy and was barred from the Port of Seattle over fears of unpaid terminal fees. The bankruptcy sent the global shipping industry into a panic, with several Hanjin ships anchored off the Pacific coast awaiting approval to unload cargo. In December, Hanjin's Terminal 46 in Seattle was sold to an affiliate of Mediterranean Shipping Company for $78 million; the move was opposed by the Port of Seattle, who filed a request to block the sale over a lack of correspondence about the new lease and <b>security</b> <b>deposit.</b>|$|E

25|$|Sivaji Ganesan {{made his}} movie debut in 1952 with Parasakthi, which {{opens with a}} song that glorifies Dravidian culture. Sivaji was a Tamil, whereas {{at the time he}} entered the film {{industry}} most other major actors were Telugus. He later became one of the founding members of DMK. Although it was DMK movies that brought Sivaji to the limelight he found that the responsibilities that the party threw at him limited his acting career. His association with DK and with DMK gave him an atheistic reputation that acted as a barrier between him and the religious segment of the audience. Realising that DMK was no longer an asset to his career, he attacked it as a glamour party and broke party protocol by his pilgrimage to Tirumala Venkateswara Temple. With the growing popularity of MGR in the party, Sivaji left DMK and aligned with the Tamil Nationalist Party of E. V. K. Sampath. When the Tamil Nationalist Party was dissolved he joined the Congress Party. Although Congress itself lost in the elections in the 1967, Sivaji's fans kept the party alive. In spite of being {{an active member of the}} Congress party, he made sure his movies were free of political references. After differences with party leaders he launched his own party, Thamizhaga Munnetra Munnani, in 1989 but with little success, even losing his <b>security</b> <b>deposit</b> in the 1991 assembly election.|$|E

This occurs when a real estate agent makes assumptions about where their client might like to live based on the color of their skin.

40|$|Our {{focus in}} this article is {{on the extent to which}} <b>security</b> <b>deposits</b> allow landlords to {{contract}} on the intensity with which tenants utilize office space. Much existing discussion recognizes that landlords expect some tenants to be more opportunistic than others, but that landlords often cannot predict a tenant's future behavior. As a consequence, landlords will charge all tenants, both low-utilization and high-utilization ones, a rental externality premium. This rental externality premium gives low-utilization tenants (or tenants with better credit quality than the market perceives) a strong incentive to sort themselves out. Our findings suggest that office rental contracts with large up-front <b>security</b> <b>deposits</b> are one way in which different tenant types can sort themselves out. Such contracts reduce landlord uncertainty and imply rental discounts in excess of the foregone interest on the deposit monies. Copyright American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association. ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{indicated}} above, {{the auction}} system was piloted in 2015 for ground-mounted photovoltaic facilities. [...] As {{a result of}} this trial, the Economics and Energy Ministry (BMWi) abandoned 'uniform pricing' in favor of 'pay-as-bid'. [...] The Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) will call for tenders for renewable projects and set the capacity to correspond to the trajectory needed for a 40–45% share in 2025. [...] Starting in 2017, there will be between three and four auctions per year for photovoltaics and onshore wind. [...] Participants will submit single sealed bids and will have to provide a substantial <b>security</b> <b>deposit</b> to ensure good faith. [...] Bids are tied to projects and locations and cannot normally be transferred. [...] The lowest bids will win until the capacity under auction is met. [...] A ceiling price is to be notified in advance. [...] Successful projects will receive the funding rate with which they won for a period of 20years. [...] Special rules apply for citizen energy projects: small projects are exempt from the auction system altogether and larger projects will receive the highest offer accepted in their round rather than their own possibly lower bid.|$|E
