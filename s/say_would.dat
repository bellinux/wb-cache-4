25|$|Marlovians {{suggest it}} is {{significant}} that every person involved in the incident seems to have been associated {{in one way or another}} either with his friend and patron Thomas Walsingham (Frizer and Skeres) or with his employers the Cecils (Poley, Bull and Danby). They point to the lengthy period (10 hours) in which the four men remained together at Eleanor Bull's house that day, and suggest this seems unnecessary if the intent had been simply to dispose of Marlowe. The most likely reason for the get-together, they <b>say,</b> <b>would</b> have been to save him in some way from the peril facing him. They claim that the faking of his death fits more of the facts as known than any other scenario. That Poley, Frizer and Skeres all made a living from being able to lie convincingly may have been relevant too.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the release}} of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Midna's {{inclusion}} as a playable character was a popular suggestion amongst fans. In an article detailing the top ten most-wanted characters for Brawl, IGN editors Phil Pirrello and Richard George ranked Midna third, citing her controlling personality and shadow-based powers, which they <b>say</b> <b>would</b> add some much-needed unconventional gameplay to the Super Smash Bros. series. Midna was also featured in two of IGN's Smash It Up editorials; first as the Reader's Choice and later amongst other dual characters. Both of these were written by Lucas M. Thomas, who also praised the character for her potential as a quality Super Smash Bros. fighter. In response to their top ten most-wanted characters list, a group of Midna fans began sending many emails to IGN, causing members of the IGN Stars staff to create an article mentioning their forum {{as well as their}} cause to have Midna appear in more video games.|$|E
500|$|Subsequently, Wainwright paired up with Diane Taylor, {{a former}} Detective Inspector from Greater Manchester Police, {{to create the}} programme, and the {{production}} expanded from Jones and Lindsay's original concept. From Taylor's perspective, police procedurals were often filled with not only technical inaccuracies, but what she felt were inaccuracies of how officers behaved, saying: [...] "that's what really irritates me in other dramas– detectives crying over dead bodies and getting drunk senseless. You'd last about two weeks". She said, of her time {{as a police officer}} in comparison to portrayals on television, that [...] "reality is much more interesting. I could pull a thousand cases out of my head people would <b>say</b> <b>would</b> never happen. People need drama because they would not believe the reality".|$|E

2500|$|Dolphy was posthumously {{inducted}} into the Down Beat magazine Hall of Fame in 1964. John Coltrane paid tribute to Dolphy in an interview: [...] "Whatever I'd <b>say</b> <b>would</b> be an understatement. I can only say my life was made much better by knowing him. He {{was one of the}} greatest people I've ever known, as a man, a friend, and a musician." [...] Dolphy's mother, Sadie, who had fond memories of her son practicing in the studio in the backyard of their house, gave instruments that Dolphy had bought in France but never played to Coltrane, who subsequently played the flute and bass clarinet on several albums before his own death in 1967.|$|E
2500|$|On September 15, 2008, {{the family}} of a 19-year-old killed in the crash {{announced}} they had filed a claim with Metrolink, generally a precursor to a lawsuit, [...] "alleging the agency chose not to use the available rail safety features," [...] referring to positive train control which they <b>say</b> <b>would</b> have averted the disaster. Eleven days later, an attorney representing the brakeman of the freight train announced a lawsuit against Metrolink, which also named Veolia Transportation and its subsidiary, Connex Railroad, the Metrolink engineer's employer, as defendants. The claim they filed against Metrolink and Veolia was denied, allowing them to proceed with the lawsuit. The lawyer asserted that the Metrolink engineer [...] "was asleep at the switch and not paying attention {{to what was going on}} around him..." [...] and that Metrolink [...] "allowed a dangerous, defective and unsafe condition to exist." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1923, Polly could not put up with their affair any longer and left for London. Harry told Constance {{that he could not}} meet Polly's demand that he [...] "love her more than anyone in the world. This is {{absolutely}} impossible". But Crosby would not leave Polly, nor did Constance ask him to. But when Constance received a letter from Polly, who confessed that Constance's affair with her husband had made her [...] "very miserable", Constance wrote Harry and told him she would not see him any more.

[...] But the three remained friends, and on October 1, 1924, Constance married the Count Pierre de Jumilhac, although the marriage only lasted five years. Polly appeared at least outwardly to tolerate Harry's dallying unconventional behavior, and she soon had her own courtiers. In her journals, she privately worried about Harry's continued loyalty to her.|$|E
2500|$|The common {{intention}} of these {{several types of}} experiments is to first do something that, some interpretations of theory <b>say,</b> <b>would</b> make each photon [...] "decide" [...] whether {{it was going to}} behave as a particle or behave as a wave, and then, before the photon had time to reach the detection device, create another change in the system that would make it seem that the photon had [...] "chosen" [...] to behave in the opposite way. Some interpreters of these experiments contend that a photon either is a wave or is a particle, and that it cannot be both at the same time. Wheeler's intent was to investigate the time-related conditions under which a photon makes this transition between alleged states of being. His work has been productive of many revealing experiments. He may not have anticipated the possibility that other researchers would tend toward the conclusion that a photon retains both its [...] "wave nature" [...] and [...] "particle nature" [...] until the time it ends its life, e.g., by being absorbed by an electron which acquires its energy and therefore rises to a higher-energy orbital in its atom. However, he himself seems to be very clear on this point. He says: ...|$|E
