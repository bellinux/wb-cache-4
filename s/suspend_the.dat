5|$|In the off-season, Ottawa's {{president}} Llewellyn Bate {{proposed to}} <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> team's operations {{until the end}} of the war. Gate receipts had declined 17 per cent. The other NHA owners refused to <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> league. Rather than simply cease operations, Bate and the other directors of the team turned it over to Ted Dey, owner of the Arena. Dey cut player salaries and let players go, including Art Ross to the Wanderers. Dey also fired manager Alf Smith, saving on his $750 salary.|$|E
5|$|Sauerbrunn {{signed with}} Sky Blue FC for the 2012 season. However, on January 30, 2012, the WPS Board of Governors voted to <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> 2012 {{season because of}} an ongoing legal dispute with Borislow {{following}} the termination of magicJack. The league officially folded in May of the same year.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} the House of Representatives {{required}} that the final two days of the chamber's session be reserved for overriding any vetoes by the governor. Beshear hoped that the House would <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> rules, as they had in previous years, in order to consider bills to increase funding to public defenders, create a transportation authority to oversee bridge-building projects in Louisville and Henderson, and provide various economic incentives, including a package intended to lure a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race to Kentucky Speedway. The House refused to <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> rules, however, citing its desire to receive legislation {{in a timely manner}} in the future. The chamber allowed Beshear's one veto to stand and adjourned a day early.|$|E

25|$|Soon after, {{the five}} judges were <b>suspended.</b> <b>The</b> judges were Tan Sri Azmi Kamaruddin, Tan Sri Eusoffe Abdoolcader, Tan Sri Wan Hamzah Mohamed Salleh, Tan Sri Wan Suleiman Pawanteh and Datuk George Seah. This {{effectively}} <b>suspended</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court. With <b>the</b> Supreme Court <b>suspended,</b> <b>the</b> challenge toward {{the legality of}} the tribunal could not be heard. The tribunal later removed Tun Salleh Abas from his office. Tan Sri Wan Sulaiman and Datuk George Seah were also removed from office. The other three judges were later reinstated.|$|R

5|$|A {{state of}} {{national}} emergency has an {{adverse effect on}} these rights. Under such a state, the rights conferred by Article 19 (freedoms of speech, assembly and movement, etc.) remain suspended. Hence, in such a situation, the legislature may make laws that go against the rights given in Article 19. Also, the President may by order <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> right to move court for the enforcement of other rights as well.|$|E

5|$|David Crowe {{writes that}} the SS had become an {{economic}} force {{in its own right}} by 1944, thanks to its plundering of Jewish businesses and ownership of factories that used slave labour from concentration camps. Jewish rescue workers made several attempts to exploit SS corruption. Gisi Fleischmann and Rabbi Michael Dov Weissmandl paid Dieter Wisliceny $20,000 in 1942 to <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> deportation of Jews from Slovakia, though whether the bribe was the reason for the suspension is debatable.|$|E
5|$|In 1803 Harrison asked Congress to <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> anti-slavery {{clause of}} the Northwest Ordinance for ten years. Harrison claimed it was {{necessary}} to increase the territory's population more quickly and attract new settlers. Congress wanted the territory to become economically viable so that the federal government would not longer have to financially support it. In 1803 the entire territory's population numbered less than 5,000. That year the legislature—which was appointed by Harrison—passed legislation reintroducing indentured servitude.|$|E
5|$|Such open {{display of}} anti-British {{feelings}} and humiliation prompted the Governor General {{of the time}} Richard Wellesley to recall Knox to India and unilaterally <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> diplomatic ties. The Treaty of 1801 was also unilaterally annulled by the British on 24 January 1804. The suspension of diplomatic ties also gave the Governor General a pretext to allow the ex-King Rana Bahadur to return to Nepal unconditionally.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Philippines <b>suspended</b> <b>the</b> {{deployment}} of migrant workers to Qatar on 6 June. However, on 7 June, they allowed the {{deployment of}} the returning workers and those with Overseas Employment Certificate, but still <b>suspended</b> <b>the</b> deployment of new workers. The suspension was later fully lifted on 15 June.|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} {{team also}} considered other methods of recovering active {{material in the}} event of a dud explosion. One idea was to cover it with a cone of sand. Another was to <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> bomb in a tank of water. As with Jumbo, it was decided not to proceed with these means of containment either. The CM-10 (Chemistry and Metallurgy) group at Los Alamos also studied how the active material could be chemically recovered after a contained or failed explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{was required to}} move an amendment in the Legislative Council (LegCo) to <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> levy {{in accordance with the}} Executive Council decision. Faced with calls to abolish the levy, the {{government was}} adamantly opposed; according to the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, the HK$5billion fund would only support the Employment Retraining Board for four or five years if the levy was permanently waived.|$|E
5|$|Although the Red Army was {{preparing}} for strategic counter-offensives before the war, Barbarossa forced the Soviet supreme command to adopt a strategic defence. During the summer, the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. By the middle of August, however, the German Army High Command decided to <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre, and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad. The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made possible further advance into Crimea and industrially developed Eastern Ukraine (the First Battle of Kharkov).|$|E

5|$|In January 2006, the ACLU filed a lawsuit, ACLU v. NSA, in {{a federal}} {{district}} court in Michigan, challenging government spying in the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy. On August 17, 2006, that {{court ruled that the}} warrantless wiretapping program is unconstitutional and ordered it ended immediately. However, the order was stayed pending an appeal. The Bush administration did <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> program while the appeal was being heard. In February 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down an appeal from the ACLU to let it pursue a lawsuit against the program that began shortly after the September 11 terror attacks.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Stevenson was a {{conservative}} stalwart, steadfastly opposing spending on internal improvements {{and maintaining a}} strict constructionist view of the constitution. He urged his fellow senators to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1871, claiming that its provision that the president could <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> right of habeas corpus in cases where he believed violence was imminent amounted to giving the chief executive the powers of a dictator. He also opposed the appropriation of federal money to fund the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{because he did not}} believe Congress was given the authority to make such an allocation under the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Most beers are {{cleared of}} yeast by {{filtering}} when packaged in bottles and cans. However, bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It is usually {{recommended that the}} beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment {{at the bottom of}} the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.|$|E

5|$|Noreen's husband, Ashiq Masih, 51 {{years old}} at the time, {{announced}} that he planned to appeal the verdict, which has to be upheld by the Lahore High Court. A month later, Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Punjab who investigated the affair for the President Asif Ali Zardari, stated that Noreen would most likely be pardoned if the High Court did not <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> sentence. Zardari was poised to grant pardon but Lahore High Court issued a stay order against potential Presidential pardon, which remains in force till date. Court transcripts show numerous inconsistencies in the evidence presented and reporters say they dare not repeat Bibi's testimony lest they also be accused of blasphemy.|$|E
5|$|One {{stipulation}} the USACE {{placed on}} the permit, however, was that no work in the Arkansas riverbed could take place after May 1 if it would interfere with the interior least tern nesting period, which was possible if the birds selected nesting sites around the bridge site. As a result, OTA worked to complete the bridge {{as quickly as possible}} to avoid the possibility of having to <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> construction. By April 1991, work in the riverbed was mostly complete, with the remaining work on the bridge posing no threat to the terns.|$|E
5|$|The French Revolution of 1789, {{in which}} the French monarchy had been overthrown, worried many British landowners. France {{declared}} war on Great Britain in 1793; in the war attempt, George allowed Pitt to increase taxes, raise armies, and <b>suspend</b> <b>the</b> right of habeas corpus. The First Coalition to oppose revolutionary France, which included Austria, Prussia, and Spain, broke up in 1795 when Prussia and Spain made separate peace with France. The Second Coalition, which included Austria, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in 1800. Only Great Britain was left fighting Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul of the French Republic.|$|E
