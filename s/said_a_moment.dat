6000|$|... "There's the answer," [...] {{the detective}} <b>said,</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> later. [...] "We shall hear some firing soon, {{whether they are}} {{successful}} or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was {{something}} else I wanted to ask," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two later. [...] "What about the man Francis. Has he been heard of lately?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was all <b>said</b> in <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{and they}} took me between them, wrapped in the cloak.|$|R
6000|$|She was dressed, and {{had been}} sitting long in quiet meditation. Mrs. Davilow was startled, but <b>said,</b> after <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> reflection-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' he <b>said</b> after <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> reflection. 'That's <b>a</b> fine {{idea in the}} abstract; but I {{doubt of}} its {{happiness}} in the long-run.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Dick!" [...] Dave <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> later, and the lad, whose rifle {{was resting}} on the rock in front of him, pulled his trigger, and almost {{immediately}} Dave fired again. Another moment and {{the mouth of the}} Canyon was clear. Another Indian lay {{by the side of the}} first who had fallen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Excuse me," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> afterwards, {{quite in}} his {{ordinary}} voice, [...] "I had {{a touch of}} it, I fancy. I lost the thread of my argument, and am dimly conscious of having expressed myself in some unusual and more or less incoherent fashion. I hope it was nothing at all vulgar or distressing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can only}} face it," [...] said the latter. [...] "They would {{scarcely}} {{listen to their}} Headman, and I can't move a limb. It's a single-shot rifle. They're bound to kill him." [...] Then he broke off with a little gasp. [...] "Ah," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> later, [...] "two of them are trying it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Cutler made no answer, but <b>said</b> sharply <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> after: [...] "We must {{attend to}} the...the death..." [...] {{and his voice}} escaped from articulation.|$|R
6000|$|... "This," [...] he <b>said,</b> after <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> gloomy silence, [...] "is, I believe, {{the young}} gentleman who gained the prize at the {{shooting}} match." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had hoped}} you would wait on some {{chance of being}} able to help us set Archie free," [...] I <b>said</b> after <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> hesitation.|$|R
6000|$|... "As you <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> ago," [...] he observed, [...] "the {{staff of}} Peaceful Moments is taking big risks. I knew {{it before you}} told me. I have had {{practical}} demonstration of the fact. And that is why this Broster Street thing {{has got to be}} finished quick. We can't afford to wait. So I am going to have you tell me this man's name right now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Hamlin--sir! You <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{ago that}} I was--er--ahem--responsible for this evening's affair--but you {{expressed}} a {{doubt as to}} who could--er--punish me for it. I accept the responsibility you have indicated, sir, and offer you that chance. But as this matter between us must have precedence over--my engagements with that canaille, I shall expect you with your seconds at sunrise on Burnt Ridge. Good-evening, sir." ...|$|E
60|$|Oakhurst. How can I believe you? You have deceived HIM. You have deceived me. Listen! When I <b>said,</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> ago, {{you were}} not the wife of Alexander Morton, it was because I knew that your first husband--the Australian convict Pritchard--was still living; that you had deceived Sandy Morton as you had deceived me. That was why I left you. Tell me, have you deceived me also about him, as you did about the other? Is HE living, and with you; or dead, as you declared.|$|E
6000|$|Bella's voice faltered as she <b>said,</b> after <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> pause, [...] "Dear Elsie never {{recovered}} the shock. She joined {{her husband in}} heaven two months afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And little you care," [...] Grizel <b>said,</b> in <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{of sudden}} bitterness, [...] "whom you leave behind, {{so long as}} you take it with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "However," [...] he <b>said,</b> after <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> consideration, [...] "why don't {{you take}} a holiday? Some of the other ladies might look after her a while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it not lucky, dear heart," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two later, [...] "that those brutes do {{not leave}} me unshaved? I could not have faced you with a week's growth of beard round my chin. By dint of {{promises}} and bribery I have persuaded one of that rabble to come and shave me every morning. They will not allow me to handle a razor my-self. They are afraid I should cut my throat--or one of theirs. But mostly I am too d--d sleepy to think of such a thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{object to}} the old old maids; they were delightful; they had always plenty to do, and didn't wander about the world crying out for a vocation. It is the new old maid that you have invented from whom I pray to be delivered." [...] He didn't say he meant Olive Chancellor, but Verena {{looked at him as}} if she {{suspected}} him of doing so; and to put her off that scent he went on, taking up what she had <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> before: [...] "As for its not being complimentary to you, my remark about the effect on the women themselves of this pernicious craze, my dear Miss Tarrant, you may be quite at your ease. You stand apart, you are unique, extraordinary; you constitute a category by yourself. In you the elements have been mixed in a manner so felicitous that I regard you as quite incorruptible. I don't know where you come from nor how you come to be what you are, but you are outside and above all vulgarising influences. Besides, you ought to know," [...] the young man proceeded, in the same cool, mild, deliberate tone, as if he were demonstrating a mathematical solution, [...] "you ought to know that your connexion with all these rantings and ravings is the most unreal, accidental, illusory thing in the world. You think you care about them, but you don't at all. They were imposed upon you by circumstances, by unfortunate associations, and you accepted them as you would have accepted any other burden, on account of the sweetness of your nature. You always want to please some one, and now you go lecturing about the country, and trying to provoke demonstrations, in order to please Miss Chancellor, just as you did it before to please your father and mother. It isn't you, the least in the world, but an inflated little figure (very remarkable in its way too) whom you have invented and set on its feet, pulling strings, behind it, to make it move and speak, while you try to conceal and efface yourself there. Ah, Miss Tarrant, if it's a question of pleasing, how much you might please some one else by tipping your preposterous puppet over and standing forth in your freedom as well as in your loveliness!" ...|$|E
6000|$|In short, Mr. McCabe {{is under}} the {{influence}} of a primary fallacy which I have found very common in men of the clerical type. Numbers of clergymen have from time to time reproached me for making jokes about religion; and they have almost always invoked the authority of that very sensible commandment which says, [...] "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain." [...] Of course, I pointed out that I was not in any conceivable sense taking the name in vain. To take a thing and make a joke out of it is not to take it in vain. It is, on the contrary, to take it and use it for an uncommonly good object. To use a thing in vain means to use it without use. But a joke may be exceedingly useful; it may contain the whole earthly sense, not to mention the whole heavenly sense, of a situation. And those who find in the Bible the commandment can find in the Bible any number of the jokes. In the same book in which God's name is fenced from being taken in vain, God himself overwhelms Job with a torrent of terrible levities. The same book which says that God's name must not be taken vainly, talks easily and carelessly about God laughing and God winking. Evidently it is not here that we have to look for genuine examples of what is meant by a vain use of the name. And it is not very difficult to see where we have really to look for it. The people (as I tactfully pointed out to them) who really take the name of the Lord in vain are the clergymen themselves. The thing which is fundamentally and really frivolous is not a careless joke. The thing which is fundamentally and really frivolous is a careless solemnity. If Mr. McCabe really wishes to know what sort of guarantee of reality and solidity is afforded by the mere act of what is called talking seriously, let him spend a happy Sunday in going the round of the pulpits. Or, better still, let him drop in at the House of Commons or the House of Lords. Even Mr. McCabe would admit that these men are solemn--more solemn than I am. And even Mr. McCabe, I think, would admit that these men are frivolous--more frivolous than I am. Why should Mr. McCabe be so eloquent about the danger arising from fantastic and paradoxical writers? Why should he be so ardent in desiring grave and verbose writers? There are not so very many fantastic and paradoxical writers. But there are a gigantic number of grave and verbose writers; and it is by the efforts of the grave and verbose writers that everything that Mr. McCabe detests (and everything that I detest, for that matter) is kept in existence and energy. How can it have come about that a man as intelligent as Mr. McCabe can think that paradox and jesting stop the way? It is solemnity that is stopping the way in every department of modern effort. It is his own favourite [...] "serious methods;" [...] it is his own favourite [...] "momentousness;" [...] it is his own favourite [...] "judgment" [...] which stops the way everywhere. Every man who has ever headed a deputation to a minister knows this. Every man who has ever written a letter to the Times knows it. Every rich man who wishes to stop the mouths of the poor talks about [...] "momentousness." [...] Every Cabinet minister who has not got an answer suddenly develops a [...] "judgment." [...] Every sweater who uses vile methods recommends [...] "serious methods." [...] I <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> ago that sincerity {{had nothing to do with}} solemnity, but I confess that I am not so certain that I was right. In the modern world, at any rate, I am not so sure that I was right. In the modern world solemnity is the direct enemy of sincerity. In the modern world sincerity is almost always on one side, and solemnity almost always on the other. The only answer possible to the fierce and glad attack of sincerity is the miserable answer of solemnity. Let Mr. McCabe, or any one else who is much concerned that we should be grave in order to be sincere, simply imagine the scene in some government office in which Mr. Bernard Shaw should head a Socialist deputation to Mr. Austen Chamberlain. On which side would be the solemnity? And on which the sincerity? ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'They've {{found the}} second will,' he <b>said,</b> after <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> with <b>a</b> rather husky voice, 'and they're {{taking steps to}} get it confirmed, {{whatever}} that may be.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what may}} that need be?" [...] he <b>said,</b> after <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> pause. In his heart he was tempted by the hinted {{opportunity}} of applying his invention.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] he <b>said,</b> after <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> pause, [...] "whether I {{might say}} {{something}} to you, whether you would listen {{to me for a}} few minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Message no use," [...] {{the chief}} <b>said,</b> after <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> thought; [...] "better take him with us, {{may be useful}} by-and-by; may want to send to settlement." ...|$|R
