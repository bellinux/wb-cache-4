5|$|In {{the cold}} open, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{shows up at}} work imitating Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) by wearing large glasses, a short <b>sleeved</b> shirt and hair split on his {{forehead}} and pokes fun at Dwight.|$|E
5|$|For {{both sexes}} clothes were tight-fitted, and narrow waists and wrists were appreciated. The silhouettes for grown men and young girls {{emphasized}} wide shoulders and narrowed to the waist; the silhouettes for female aristocrats were more complicated. The Sogdian clothing underwent a thorough process of Islamization {{in the ensuing}} centuries, with few of the original elements remaining. In their stead, turbans, kaftans, and <b>sleeved</b> coats became more common.|$|E
5|$|The basic garment for all Romans, {{regardless}} of gender or wealth, was the simple <b>sleeved</b> tunic. The length differed by wearer: a man's reached mid-calf, but a soldier's was somewhat shorter; a woman's {{fell to her}} feet, and a child's to its knees. The tunics of poor people and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades, with the length determined {{by the type of}} work they did. Finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes (clavi) woven vertically into the fabric: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status. Other garments could be layered over the tunic.|$|E
25|$|Earlier type 11 & 12 plugs had {{line and}} neutral pins without <b>sleeved</b> pins, which present a shock hazard when {{partially}} inserted into non-recessed sockets. Since 1 January 2013, only type 11 & 12 plugs with line and neutral pins partially <b>sleeved</b> {{are allowed to}} be imported and distributed to reduce the risk.|$|E
25|$|The 30-year {{anniversary of}} C86 saw the {{original}} compilation issued in a deluxe gatefold <b>sleeved</b> double-LP edition for Record Store Day 2016.|$|E
25|$|Manipuri - This sari {{style is}} also worn with three-set garment known as Innaphi viel, Phanek lower wrap and long <b>sleeved</b> choli.|$|E
25|$|Tropical working uniforms existed, {{but were}} {{variations}} on the working khaki and utility uniforms. Knee shorts and black knee socks are worn, along with short <b>sleeved</b> button-up shirts.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, the new dark navy uniform was {{introduced}} to all officers as the new standard. The pants are made from rip-stop fabric, the undergarment made from cotton stretch which can be short <b>sleeved</b> or long <b>sleeved</b> and is to be worn under the ballistic vest. Baseball caps remained, although they are darker in colour than pre 2013. The new dark uniform was designed to look more professional and to hide blood, dirt and sweat. The dark blue uniform was modelled after the Oxfordshire and Northumberland police attires.|$|E
25|$|Depictions {{of kings}} and their attendants from the Old Assyrian Empire and Babylonia on monuments like the Black Obelisk of Salmanazar show men wearing fringed cloths wrapped around their <b>sleeved</b> tunics.|$|E
25|$|Station/office dress {{consists}} of navy blue trousers, navy blue long or short <b>sleeved</b> shirts (which {{can be worn}} either open-neck or with a tie), navy blue peaked hat and black boots/shoes.|$|E
25|$|Until 1994 the No.1 Dress {{was also}} the {{everyday}} working uniform, but today it is rarely seen except on formal occasions. The normal working dress retains the shirt and trousers. In some forces short <b>sleeved</b> shirts may be worn open-necked. Long <b>sleeved</b> shirts must always be worn with a tie or cravat, worn {{with or without a}} jersey or fleece. If a jersey, fleece or jacket is worn over a short <b>sleeved</b> shirt, then a tie must be worn. In 2003, Strathclyde Police replaced the white shirts with black wicking T-shirts with stab vest on top, for the majority of officers on duty. Some forces use combat trousers (trousers are of a cargo pocket style i.e. two thigh pockets and two conventional side and rear pockets) and boots. Today, female officers almost never wear a skirt in working dress, and sometimes wear trousers in formal dress as well. Officers also frequently wear reflective waterproof jackets, which have replaced the old greatcoats and cloaks traditionally worn in inclement weather. Most officers now wear stab vests, a type of body armour, when on duty.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally dressed gourd dancers wear {{buckskin}} leggings and a long, red breechcloth. These {{are covered}} by a black fringed shawl wrapped above the black shawl to secure it. Today these are accompanied with a long <b>sleeved</b> shirt, bolo tie or tie.|$|E
25|$|In Ancient Greece the simple, <b>sleeved</b> T-shaped tunics were {{constructed}} of three seamed tubes of cloth, {{a style that}} originated in the Semitic Near East, along with the Semitic-based word khiton, {{also referred to as}} a chiton. The belted worn linen chiton was the primary garment for men and women.|$|E
25|$|The third jersey trend {{only got}} {{stronger}} when the NBA signed exclusive uniform contracts with Reebok and later Adidas. The Adidas deal, in particular, saw {{the introduction of}} additional alternate uniforms {{in an effort to}} boost jersey sales; examples include the Golden State Warriors' <b>sleeved</b> alternates and the Heat's monochrome uniforms.|$|E
25|$|A {{seamless}} dipped latex two-piece suit by {{an unidentified}} manufacturer, apparently marketed exclusively for women. was catalogued by Palley's of California {{in the early}} 1950s. The suit was made in two sections, connected by a rolled overlap similar to the Pirelli suits, and were available in long or short leg versions and long or short <b>sleeved</b> versions, all with integral neck, and cuff or arm and thigh seals. A separate hood was also available, and optional boots for the long leg version.|$|E
25|$|In Scouts Australia, the Cub Scout {{program is}} open to all {{children}} (girls and boys) ages 7.5-11. The uniform is a navy-blue, button-up or polo-style, short <b>sleeved</b> shirt with a yellow collar, sleeves and shoulders. Sixes are identified by a coloured round badge (black, white, tawny, brown) in the shirt shoulder. Sixers wear an oblong strip on their uniform. If the sixer is away, a second comes in charge, but if the sixer is inside the pack the second will act as an assistant or helper.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Magic {{unveiled}} a silver uniform {{for the first}} time in their history. It was <b>sleeved,</b> and featuring white pinstripes along with blue, black and white trim for the letters and numbers. Unlike the three other uniforms, a different striping pattern will be used on the sides. In 2016, The Magic {{unveiled a}} third alternate uniform, featuring carbon as the primary color and without pinstripes. Named “Stars”, it featured the team's secondary logo and a blue, white and blue tricolor stripe in front, along with white lettering.|$|E
25|$|A xhamadan or xhamadani is a {{traditional}} wool garment, which is worn by Albanian men. It can be <b>sleeved</b> or sleeveless. The sleeveless xhamadan is only one type of the Albanian jelek (or vest), the other two being the jelek me reshme, and the jelek fermele. The jelek me reshme went out of use around {{the beginning of the}} 20th century. whereas the xhamadan and the jelek fermele continue to be used in traditional festivities. A good xhamadan is usually richly embroidered, sometimes in gold: in the past its quality revealed social rank.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Healthways retailed Carib drysuits, made of 3-ply {{translucent}} gum rubber, {{and available}} in {{long and short}} versions. Entry was by a front chute with rubber band closure. The full version included an integral hood and covered the feet. In 1957, they added the Aqua King and Aqua Flite dry suits to their product range. The Aqua King suit was a full-length waist entry suit, comprising hood, long <b>sleeved</b> shirt, booted pants and waistline sealing ring, and was made of seamless latex rubber. All these suits were available in small medium and large sizes.|$|E
25|$|Costume {{is another}} {{strength}} of the collection. In addition to the 'oldest dress' there is a unique beadnet dress of a dancer from the Pyramid Age (about 2400 BC), two long <b>sleeved</b> robes of the same date, a suit of armour from the palace of Memphis, as well as socks and sandals from the Roman period. The collection contains works of art from Akhenaten’s city at Amarna: colourful tiles, carvings and frescoes, from many other important Egyptian and Nubian settlements and burial sites. The museum houses the world’s largest collection of Roman period mummy portraits (first to second centuries AD).|$|E
25|$|The sacred temples in Thailand {{follow a}} dress code, which is {{strictly}} followed. Men must wear long trousers and <b>sleeved</b> shirts and shoes; women must wear long skirts. Visitors who arrive dressed otherwise may rent appropriate clothing items at the entry {{area of the}} temple. It is compulsory to remove the shoes before entering the temple, {{as a sign of}} respect of the Buddha, as is the practice in all other temples in Thailand. While offering prayers before the Buddha image, the sitting posture should avoid any offensive stretching of feet towards the deity; the feet should be tucked in towards the back.|$|E
25|$|On Christmas Day 2012, the Knicks wore {{monochrome}} uniforms {{known as}} 'Big Color'. The uniforms are mostly orange, with blue trimming. The following year, the Knicks wore <b>sleeved</b> orange uniforms known as 'Big Logo', featuring a chrome-treated Knicks logo in front. For the 2014 edition, the Knicks wore {{a variation of}} their home uniforms, featuring the team logo in front and the player's first name in a blue nameplate below the number. The 2016 Christmas Day game against the Celtics saw the Knicks wear an all-blue uniform without additional striping, complete with fancy scripted orange lettering and numbers.|$|E
25|$|The summer service uniform was a two-piece {{green and}} white outfit made of {{washable}} seersucker material. It had two pieces, a skirt and a short-sleeved jacket with a V-neck. The cap was green and decorated with a white cord, buttons were white, chevrons were green, and emblems were bronze. The shoes were brown, the gloves were white, and the handbags were light green. The summer dress uniform was made of white twill. It had short sleeves and a V-neck, worn with gilt buttons on the jacket and cap, with dress emblems and white pumps. The officers could choose between three summer dress uniforms. The first was the white one worn by enlisted women, but with added green shoulder straps. The other two were made of white twill or palm-beach material. One was a short-sleeved blouse, {{and the other was}} long <b>sleeved</b> and collarless.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 2009, the Bulls wore white {{shoes at}} {{home during the}} regular season, black shoes {{on the road and}} black shoes home and away all {{throughout}} the playoffs. The unofficial playoff tradition goes back to the Jordan era, recommended by Brad Sellers as a show of team unity. The Bulls also wore their red uniform on all playoff road games, until the team opted to wear their <b>sleeved</b> black uniforms in the 2017 NBA Playoffs. During the 2008–09 season and first three games of the playoffs, however, the Bulls wore black sneakers on away games only while wearing white sneakers on home games. Since the 2009–10 season, however, the NBA has relaxed its rules on specific sneaker colors on home and away games, and several Bulls players are seen wearing white sneakers on the road, or black at home during the regular season, even seen wearing red on occasion.|$|E
25|$|The basic garment {{for both}} genders and all classes was the tunica (tunic), often worn beneath {{one or more}} {{additional}} layers. In its simplest form, the tunic was a single rectangle of woven fabric, originally woolen, but from the mid-republic onward, increasingly made from linen. It was sewn into a sleeveless tubular shape and pinned around the shoulders like a Greek chiton, to form openings for the neck and arms. In some examples from {{the eastern part of}} the empire, neck openings were formed in the weaving. Sleeves could be added. Most working men wore knee-length, short-sleeved tunics, secured at the waist with a belt. Some traditionalists considered long <b>sleeved</b> tunics appropriate only for women, very long tunics on men as a sign of effeminacy, and short or unbelted tunics as marks of servility. Women's tunics were usually ankle or foot-length, long-sleeved, and could be worn loosely or belted. Though essentially simple in basic design, tunics could also be luxurious in their fabric, colours and detailing.|$|E
25|$|On September 19, 2012, the Spurs {{unveiled}} a silver alternate uniform. In breaking {{from the traditional}} practice of placing the team or city name in front, the Spurs' new uniform features only the stylized spur logo, with the black number trimmed in white and silver on the upper right. The Spurs primary logo is atop the player name and number on the back (replaced by the NBA logo prior to the 2014–15 season), while the Eurostile 'SA' initials (for San Antonio) are on the left leg of the shorts. Black, silver and white side stripes are also featured on the uniform. The uniforms are worn for select home games. A variation of this uniform, featuring military camouflage patterns {{instead of the usual}} silver, was used for two games in the 2013–14 season; a <b>sleeved</b> version was used the next season. Another variation, this time in black, was unveiled for the 2015–16 season.|$|E
25|$|Back in the 1940s {{there were}} many members {{that were in the}} military. During that time period it was not easy for all of the members to get {{together}} for meetings because of gas rationing. On May 27 and 28, 1944 the first formal convention was held. This meeting was led by Jane Farrow and Jo Folden in Columbus, Ohio. The first Regional Meeting was held later that year in Plainfield, New Jersey. From this came the decision on the colors and the logo for Motor Maids. It was decided that royal blue and silver gray would make up the colors and a shield would represent the logo. Another thing that came from this meeting was the uniform for the group. At the start the uniforms were tailor-made of silver-gray gabardine with royal blue piping. This soon changed and the uniform became gray slacks, royal blue over-blouse with white boots, and a tie. Down the road in 2006, the group voted to change the uniform again. It was then changed to what it is in present day. It consists of black pants and boots, royal blue mock neck long <b>sleeved</b> shirt with a white cotton vest, and white gloves. White gloves were added in 1941 when Howard Foley went to the motor maids with the idea of parading at the Charity Newsies Race. During this parade, the Motor Maids wore white gloves making them known as the “Ladies of the White Gloves”. They continued to parade for this event each year up until 1979. The Motor Maids are required to wear royal blue mock turtleneck and white cotton vest, jet-black slacks, and clean black footwear. For parades white gloves are added. The rest are required at a convention for the parade, formal group picture, and banquet.|$|E
500|$|This Robe of State is {{directed}} to be worn with a <b>sleeved</b> crimson velvet kirtle, which is similarly edged with miniver and worn over a full-length white or cream court dress (without a train).|$|E
500|$|As for Explorer Scouts, {{but with}} a shirt of a light khaki colour, {{described}} as [...] "stone" [...] which may be short <b>sleeved.</b> [...] A tie may be worn by all adult members and smart trousers may be worn instead of combat trousers. [...] The activity uniform top is a navy blue polo shirt, an optional navy blue sweatshirt or stone-coloured polo shirt may be worn instead.|$|E
500|$|The four {{drew up a}} {{contract}} as equal partners in Werber's office in San Francisco, deciding first on the name [...] "Kingston Trio" [...] because it evoked, through its association with Kingston, Jamaica, the calypso music popular at the time, and second on the uniform of three-quarter-length <b>sleeved</b> vertically striped shirts that the group hoped would help their target audience of college students to identify with them.|$|E
500|$|Scout uniform {{consists}} of a teal green long <b>sleeved</b> shirt or blouse, navy blue combat trousers (or navy blue skirt), group neckerchief, woggle and a scout belt. [...] Uniform options decided on at the group level include navy blue shorts, a grey fleece jacket, a navy blue jacket and a navy blue baseball cap. [...] Navy blue combat trousers and a teal green polo shirt may be worn as activity dress.|$|E
500|$|The {{final three}} clips in the montage of Tracy {{taking off his}} shirt are real clips from Tracy Morgan interviews. Also, Elisa wears a [...] "What the Frak?!" [...] Battlestar Galactica t-shirt, as she admits her secret to Jack and Liz. [...] "It's not product placement—I just like it!", says Liz to Jack, after he storms into her office and {{she is wearing a}} [...] Slanket, a <b>sleeved</b> blanket with sleeves usually made of fleece material.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, Bubbles and Jackson were {{photographed by}} Kenny Rogers for his book, Your Friends and Mine. The photo shows Bubbles held on Jackson's hip, {{and has been}} cited {{as one of the}} best taken of Jackson. In the black and white photograph, Bubbles is dressed casually in a long <b>sleeved</b> shirt and overalls. Jackson is also dressed casually; he wears jeans and a simple shirt. Rogers said: [...] "Bubbles was so human it was almost frightening. He would take Christopher [...] by the hand, walk over to the refrigerator, open it, take out a banana and hand it to him. Christopher was amazed... we all were." ...|$|E
500|$|However, the FIVB's mandating of the bikini {{ran into}} problems. Some sports {{officials}} consider it exploitative and impractical in colder weather. It also drew {{the ire of}} some athletes. At the 2006 Asian Games at Doha, Qatar, only one Muslim country– Iraq– fielded a team in the beach volleyball competition because of concerns that the uniform was inappropriate. They refused to wear bikinis. The weather during the evening games in 2012 London Olympics was so cold that the players sometimes had to wear shirts and leggings. Earlier in 2012, FIVB had announced it would allow shorts (maximum length [...] above the knee) and <b>sleeved</b> tops at the games. Richard Baker, the federation spokesperson, said that [...] "many of these countries have religious and cultural requirements so the uniform needed to be more flexible".|$|E
500|$|The charioteer {{was usually}} either {{a family member}} of {{the owner of the}} chariot or, in most cases, a slave or a hired professional. Driving a racing chariot {{required}} unusual strength, skill, and courage. Yet, we know the names of very few charioteers, and victory songs and statues regularly contrive to leave them out of account. Unlike the other Olympic events, charioteers did not perform in the nude, probably for safety reasons because of the dust kicked up by the horses and chariots, and the likelihood of bloody crashes. Racers wore a <b>sleeved</b> garment called a xystis. It fell to the ankles and was fastened high at the waist with a plain belt. Two straps that crossed high at the upper back prevented the xystis from [...] "ballooning" [...] during the race.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} was filmed in November 2012 and premiered on 5 December 2012. The video has a metaphorical theme, and features Lewis {{in a giant}} bird cage in a dimly lit room, wearing the long ivory <b>sleeved</b> dress and [...] "jewelled eye decorations". Some scenes show the singer in a shadow and darker settings, while others are light and colourful. For most of the video, Lewis ponders {{about being able to}} escape her cage and experience freedom. At the end of the video, she realises that the cage is in fact unlocked and she is able to leave her confine, and leaves. Lucy Buckland for the Daily Mail felt that Lewis looks [...] "positively mournful" [...] in the video, and that while {{it may not be the}} best advert for feminism, she looks [...] "beautiful".|$|E
