25|$|There is {{a general}} sense in which any Tibetan Buddhist teacher is called a lama. A <b>student</b> <b>may</b> have taken teachings from many {{authorities}} and revere them all as lamas in this general sense. However, he will typically have one held in special esteem as his own root guru and is encouraged to view the other teachers who are less dear to him, however more exalted their status, as embodied in and subsumed by the root guru. Often the teacher the student sees as root guru is simply the one who first introduced him to Buddhism, but a <b>student</b> <b>may</b> also change his personal view of which particular teacher is his root guru any number of times.|$|E

5000|$|All {{district}} students, {{except those}} with parent or religious waivers {{and those with}} too much financial hardship {{to abide by the}} rule, are required to abide by a dress code that restricts colors worn by <b>students.</b> <b>Students</b> <b>may</b> wear solid red, white, or navy blue shirts, including collared shirts, T-shirts, blouses, turtlenecks, sweaters, and sweatshirts. <b>Students</b> <b>may</b> wear navy blue bottoms, including trousers, skirts, skorts, culottes, jumpers, and shorts. <b>Students</b> <b>may</b> wear dress or athletic shoes colored navy blue, black, white, or red.

25|$|According to {{psychologist}} B. F. Skinner, phobias {{are controlled}} by escape and avoidance behaviors. For instance, a <b>student</b> <b>may</b> leave the room when talking {{in front of the}} class (escape) and refrain from doing verbal presentations because of the previously encountered anxiety attack (avoid). Major avoidance behaviors could include an almost pathological/compulsive lying behavior in order to preserve self-image and avoid judgement in front of others. Minor avoidance behaviors are exposed when a person avoids eye contact and crosses his/her arms to avoid recognizable shaking. A fight-or-flight response is then triggered in such events.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{students}} adjust {{the same way}} to their new setting. One <b>student</b> <b>may</b> take only three months, while others may take four years. One study found that even in their fourth year of schooling, Lao and Vietnamese refugee students in the US were still in a transitional status. Refugee students will continue to encounter difficulties throughout their years in schools that can hinder their ability to learn. Furthermore, educators must consider the experiences of students pre-settlement in the US {{in order to provide}} them with the proper support.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{should be}} {{considered}} in the development of intervention strategies. These include, but are not limited to: developmental level of the child, comorbid disabilities, environmental changes, motivating factors, and coaching strategies. It is also recommended that strategies should take a proactive approach in managing behaviour or skill deficits (when possible), rather than adopt a reactive approach. For example, an awareness of where a <b>student</b> <b>may</b> have difficulty throughout {{the course of the day}} can aid the teacher in planning to avoid these situations or in planning to accommodate the needs of the student.|$|E
50|$|<b>Students</b> <b>may</b> also {{elect to}} {{participate}} in the school sport and music programs. Annandale participates in many sports including Soccer, Netball, Rugby League and Hockey. <b>Students</b> <b>may</b> also elect to learn a musical instrument such as the Violin, Trumpet, Flute or the Drums.|$|R

25|$|As part {{of their}} initial training, music theorists will {{typically}} complete a B.Mus or a B.A. in music (or a related field) {{and in many cases}} an M.A. in music theory. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a Ph.D, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for music theory Ph.D programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a <b>student</b> <b>may</b> apply with a B.Mus and a Masters in Music Composition or Philosophy of Music).|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{students}} are enrolled into their respective faculties, they may still choose a lecture from another faculty. The lectures are divided into three categories, A (obligatory), which a student of a given field has to pass; B (facultatory), certain number of which a student has to pass in order to collect enough ECTS-credits; and C (facultatory) which a <b>student</b> <b>may</b> choose to appeal his interest in a different field. Therefore it is possible, for example, for a Law Faculty graduate to have strong knowledge of Biochemistry, if he decides for the C lectures of Faculty of Science.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} elementary school, {{students are}} obliged to take one year in high school. They are able to pick from Gymnasium, which {{is seen as the}} highest level of high-school education and usually considered as a preparatory school for attending a university, although anyone can apply to any university. Besides Gymnasiums, Slovakia has specialised high schools with bacalaureat and specialised highschools without bacalaureat. Schools with bacalaureat take 5 years to complete while the ones without usually take less. Gymnasiums and many other high schools require passing an entry exam, consider previous study results or perform a combination of both before accepting a new student. A <b>student</b> <b>may</b> apply to two high schools at once. If student fails to get accepted in any high school, the student can submit an appeal or seek a third high school with an empty slot for one more student outside of the standard application process. Parents and students prefer to avoid this uncertainty and tend to choose at least one high school with a high chance of acceptance. Most high-schools are finished by passing a matura exam, which consists of Slovak language and literature, one foreign language and one specialised subject. If school offered multiple specializations or taught multiple foreign languages, <b>student</b> <b>may</b> choose which subject he or she wants to do the matura exam in. If student wants and the school allows it, it's possible to do matura exam in more than three subjects.|$|E
