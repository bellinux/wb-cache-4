60|$|I {{now believe}} that the sensations of {{sickness}} and approaching death in the riding-horse of the pampas resemble or similate the pains, so often experienced, of hunger, thirst and fatigue combined, together with the oppressive sensations caused by the ponderous native saddle, or recado, with its huge surcingle of raw hide drawn up so tightly as to hinder free respiration. The <b>suffering</b> <b>animal</b> remembers how at the last relief invariably came, when the twelve or fifteen hours' torture were over, the toil and the want, and when the great iron bridle and ponderous gear were removed, and he had freedom and food and drink and rest. At the gate or {{at the door of}} his master's house, the sudden relief had always come to him; and there does he sometimes go in his sickness, his fear overmastered by his suffering, to find it again.|$|E

But Tito's mind was just now thoroughly penetrated with a hopeful first love, associated with all happy prospects flattering to his ambition; and that future necessity of grieving Tessa could be scarcely more to him than the far-off cry of some little <b>suffering</b> <b>animal</b> buried in the thicket, to a merry cavalcade in the sunny plain. When, for the second time that day, Tito was hastening across the Ponte Rubaconte, the thought of Tessa caused no perceptible diminution of his happiness.

60|$|Discussing this {{question}} with a friend, {{who has a}} subtle mind and great experience of the horse in semi-barbarous countries, and of many other animals, wild and tame, in many regions of the globe, he put forward a different explanation of {{the action of the}} horse in coming home to die, which he thinks simpler and more probable than mine. It is, that a dying or ailing animal instinctively withdraws itself from its fellows--an action of self-preservation in the individual in opposition to the well-known instincts of the healthy animals, which impels the whole herd to turn upon and persecute the sickly member, thus destroying its chances of recovery. The desire of the <b>suffering</b> <b>animal</b> is not only to leave its fellows, but to get to some solitary place where they cannot follow, or would never find him, to escape at once from a great and pressing danger. But on the pastoral pampas, where horses are so numerous that on that level, treeless area they are always and everywhere visible, no hiding-place is discoverable. In such a case, the animal, goaded by its instinctive fear, turns to the one spot that horses avoid; and although that spot has hitherto been fearful to him, the old fear is forgotten in the present and far more vivid one; the vicinity of his master's house represents a solitary place to him, and he seeks it, just as the stricken deer seeks the interior of some close forest, oblivious for the time, in its anxiety to escape from the herd, of the dangers lurking in it, and which he formerly avoided.|$|E
50|$|Animal {{welfare is}} a {{philosophy}} which {{is concerned with}} regulating the use of animals to reduce unnecessary pain and <b>suffering.</b> <b>Animal</b> welfare holds that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that adverse effects on animal welfare are minimised as far as possible, short of not using the animals at all.|$|E

50|$|Animal dysthanasia (from the Greek, meaning “difficult death”: dys (bad; difficult) + thanatos (death)) {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of prolonging the life of animals that are seriously or even terminally ill and that are potentially experiencing <b>suffering.</b> <b>Animal</b> dysthanasia is a recent concept, emerging from changes in the social perception of animals and from advances in veterinary care.|$|E

The manuscript ends with the man, by then partly covered by the fungal growth, locked (from the outside only) in his study as the creature comes through a trap door in the basement from the chasm under the house.

50|$|Decision upon animal {{euthanasia}} {{often takes}} into account the relief of pain and <b>suffering.</b> <b>Animal</b> dysthanasia occurs because there is no agreement upon the acceptable and recognizable endpoints of the lives of companion animals. This is due to several reasons. The keeper (guardian; owner) may wish to extend the animal’s life because he rejects euthanasia as an acceptable solution. On the other hand, the veterinarian may have a scientific interest on studying the progress of a specific illness or even a financial interest in keeping the patient alive. The keeper and the veterinarian may also want to make use of all possible treatment resources before making the decision of euthanasia. Genuine belief on the animal’s recovery and emotional attachment can also interfere on the decision-making process of euthanasia. Situations like these can be especially problematic in some veterinary specialities like small animal oncology where the course of the disease may be difficult to predict and the treatments themselves can cause severe distress.|$|E

50|$|Animal People, Inc. is a {{non-profit}} animal rights charity dedicated to generating knowledge and raising {{public awareness of}} animal sentience and <b>suffering.</b> <b>Animal</b> People was founded in 1992 with the mission of “exposing the existence of cruelty to animals and educating the public {{of the need to}} prevent and eliminate such cruelty; conducting or sponsoring animal care projects, both to directly alleviate animal suffering and to demonstrate humane methods of handling and responding to animal-related dilemmas; and studying animal-related issues via research, surveys, and investigative reports.” From 1992 until 2013, the organization's main project was publishing the newspaper Animal People News, which covered current events related to animal issues worldwide. The newspaper was retired in 2014 following a split within the board of directors, and in 2015 Animal People launched a new project, the Animal People Forum, an online magazine and social networking site for people interested in animal rights, welfare, and conservation.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, the {{resulting}} animal emulations themselves might suffer, depending on one's views about consciousness. Bancroft argues for the plausibility of consciousness in brain simulations {{on the basis}} of the [...] "fading qualia" [...] thought experiment of David Chalmers. He then concludes:If, as I argue above, a sufficiently detailed computational simulation of the brain is potentially operationally equivalent to an organic brain, it follows that we must consider extending protections against suffering to simulations.It might help reduce emulation suffering to develop virtual equivalents of anaesthesia, as well as to omit processing related to pain and/or consciousness.

However, while much attention {{has been devoted to}} curative options, research into neuropathic pain mechanisms and relief has been somewhat lacking. Recent studies have demonstrated a variety of sensory abnormalities in different EAE and EAN models, which enable investigations of behavioural changes, underlying mechanisms, and potential pharmacotherapies for neuropathic pain associated with these diseases. This review examines the symptoms, mechanisms, and clinical therapeutic options in these conditions and highlights the value of EAE and EAN animal models for the study of neuropathic pain in MS and GBS...|$|E
40|$|It is my {{pleasure}} to follow the invitation by AV magazine to contribute an article. The support by animal welfare organizations from Europe and increasingly from the U.

40|$|Leśmian’s poems, {{those that}} can be treated as parables with the thirdperson narrator and a given plot and those written with the lyrical I and {{straightforward}} narrative, include a dominant and premeditated anthropological conception. Leśmian is intrigued by the relation between an individual and other people. The relation is conducive, or even essential, in the spiritual survival of the individual, and {{is often described as}} a “salvation”. The relevant issues can be interpreted within the language of the philosophy of dialogue, including the philosophy of Emmanuel Lévinas, though the latter cannot be obviously treated in terms of decisive influence. The space where the ethical dimension of the interpersonal relations is revealed is namely love towards the closest pesons, it is followed by the encounter with other people, and finally the encounter with radical otherness, with what is, beyond the very experience of humanity, different — with a <b>suffering</b> <b>animal.</b> In Leśmian’s poetical output, in which the ontological and epistemological dimensions are so important, it is rather the ethical dimension that becomes prominent. This dimension, often neglected by researches of the poet’s rich and versified output, quite unexpectedly seems to come down to some absolutely fundamental ethical imperatives: to love and keep in mind that one should not hurt or kill with words or deeds. </p...|$|E
