The Body Toner Fly <b>Swatter</b> sold for $8,600, the Willi Waller Potato Peeler sold for $3,550, and the LCD Shovel sold for $2,146.21.|$|E
25|$|Each day Hilde visits Anton's grave mentally {{talking to}} {{him as if he}} is still alive. One evening, as she is {{returning}} home, Hilde discovers that a black cat seems to be following her. The cat causes her to remember two distinct experiences from her past. The first is a memory from when she was a small child and had attempted to hide a stray cat in her bedroom. Her family was very poor and could not afford a pet, but she saved her table scraps for it anyway. One day as she was coming home, her father met her drunk in the doorway. After telling her he had snapped the cat's neck, he beat her harshly with a fly <b>swatter.</b> This first memory seeped into the second: her daughter, Erika, begging to keep a stray cat she had found. Anton had granted her wish, but the cat ruined the neighbors' gardens and Hilde was forced to drown it in the river.|$|E
25|$|Mind in the ToK system {{refers to}} the set of mental {{behaviors}}. Mental behaviors are behaviors of animals mediated by the nervous system that produce a functional effect on the animal-environment relationship. As such, Mind is essentially synonymous with what behavioral psychologists have meant when they use the term behavior. Thus, a fly avoiding a fly <b>swatter,</b> a rat pushing a bar or a human getting {{a drink of water}} are all mental behaviors. Mind is not synonymous with sentience or the capacity for mental experience, although such processes are presumed to emerge in the mental dimension. Cognition, in the broad sense of the term (i.e., as meaning neuro-information processing) is seen as covert mental behavior, whereas change between the animal and the environment is defined as overt mental behavior. Thus, by defining mind as mental behavior, Henriques argues that the ToK System provides a way to bridge the epistemological differences between cognitive and behavioral science.|$|E

2500|$|A fly <b>swatter</b> is a {{hand-held}} device for swatting and killing flies and other insects. The first modern fly-destruction device {{was invented in}} 1900 by Robert R.

2500|$|As a {{consequence}} of MacDougall's jamming, and ambiguity about the federal misdemeanor charge made against him under 47 U.S.C. § 301, the United States Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. [...] ) which made satellite hijacking a felony. The FCC subsequently implemented strict requirements that all radio and television transmitters must have an electronic name tag for tracking purposes. The Automatic Transmitter Identification System (ATIS) was developed {{in response to the}} Captain Midnight jamming incident. It allows satellite operators to quickly identify unauthorized uplink transmissions. In 2009, HBO and Elmer Musser were awarded a Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for ATIS. Although HBO has not been targeted since the channel's signal power was increased to {{make it more difficult for}} hijackers to intrude, there have been multiple instances of uplink video piracy across the United States. One such incident happened in November 1987, when WGN-TV in Chicago had its transmission briefly interrupted by a man in a Max Headroom mask, and that same evening, the signal of PBS affiliate WTTW was overridden for one-and-a-half minutes, where the same person mooned the viewing audience and had his buttocks struck with a fly <b>swatter.</b> The jamming did not appear to affect HBO's pricing policies in the long-term.|$|E
5000|$|An {{advantage}} over conventional flyswatters {{is that the}} electrical models {{do not have to}} mechanically crush the fly against a hard surface to kill it, avoiding the smeared mess this can create. [...] Also, the electrical grid can be relatively open, reducing air resistance and a rush of air that often deflects smaller insects around conventional <b>swatters.</b> Because of this, electric <b>swatters</b> can also be very effective in killing airborne mosquitos and [...] "no-see-ums".|$|R
