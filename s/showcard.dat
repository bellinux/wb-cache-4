40|$|The {{research}} {{presented here}} aimed to obtain population norms on pertinent domains {{of quality of}} life and health related quality of life, and the relative importance of these domains to people. The OPCS Omnibus Survey was used as the vehicle for the study. This is a monthly survey of a random sample of 2000 adult members of the population in Great Britain, based on a random sample of households. The data was collected for a one month period. The response rate to the survey was 77 %. In response to a generic question about the five (priority ordered) most important things in their lives (good or bad), respondents were most likely to freely mention as the first most important thing in their lives relationships with family or relatives, followed by their own health, the health of another (close) person and finances/standard of living/housing. When responses relating to respondents' priority ranked areas 1 - 5 were combined, the most frequently mentioned area of life was finances/standard of living/housing, followed by relationships with family and friends, own health, the health of close others and social life/leisure activities. Thus, different distributions were obtained depending on whether priority ordering or frequency with which item was mentioned was analysed. Of those who reported a longstanding illness, the conditions which were most likely to be reported as affecting their lives were respiratory conditions, joint disorders and heart and circulatory diseases. The most commonly freely mentioned first most important effects of the longstanding illness on their lives were (in order of frequency) ability to get out and about/stand/walk/go out shopping, being able to work/find a job and effects on social life/leisure activities (based on office coding from verbatim responses recorded on the questionnaire). When the responses relating to respondents' priority ranks 1 - 5 were combined, the most frequently mentioned area of life affected was ability to get out and about/stand/walk/go out shopping, followed by social life/leisure activities, and availability of work/ability to work. Again, differences in distributions were obtained depending on the method of analysis. Further investigations also revealed differences according to the method of questioning and coding (respondent vs office). When respondents selected their own codes from a <b>showcard</b> in relation to health effects, there were some discrepancies with their (office coded) verbatim replies (which were recorded by the interviewer before they saw the <b>showcard,</b> for later office coding). The <b>showcard</b> had the effect of prompting them, and the then most commonly mentioned first most important effects of the longstanding illness on their lives were (in order of frequency) pain, tiredness/lack of energy/lethargy, social life/leisure activities, and availability of work/ability to work. This discrepancy illustrates the biasing influence of using showcards, in comparison with the open coding of actual verbatim responses back in the office (on the assumption that the latter are more valid-unprompted-responses). Analysis of the domains included in the most popularly used health status scales, which are used to measure health related quality of life, revealed that several items ranked as important by the public were missing. quality of life health related quality of life health status chronic illness...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} the income {{question}} in household surveys usually includes response options for actual income, bounded values, “Don’t Know ” and “Refuse ” responses. This paper conducts an analysis of these response types using sequential response models. We analyse the em-ployee income question in Statistics South Africa’s October Household Surveys (1997 - 1999) and Labour Force Surveys (2000 - 2003). The choice of survey years coincides with a period of development of the income question during which additional response options were steadily introduced to the questionnaire. An analysis of this sort sheds light on the underlying re-sponse process, which is useful for survey planning purposes and to researchers concerned with diagnosing the item missing and partial response mechanisms for variables of interest. It {{was found that the}} presentation of follow-up brackets overturned initial refusals to the income question, and that these respondents were higher income earners. In the sequential response models, initial nonresponse was therefore clearly correlated with predictors of in-come, but after the presentation of the bracket <b>showcards,</b> this correlate of income effect was removed. This suggested that final nonresponse was no longer a function of income. This has important implications for ignorability determination and (single or multiple) imputation strategies for it implies that the missingness mechanism is likely missing at random. ...|$|R

Project description: This project aimed to provide critical {{evidence about the}} usage, experiences and outcomes of different forms of alternative family dispute resolution (AFDR) on relationship breakdown, namely solicitor negotiations, mediation and collaborative law, {{at a time when}} these court alternatives were becoming increasingly used. In particular, it explored how well known and how widely used each of these processes had become nationally; how positive or negative people's experiences of these processes were in the short and longer term; what (if any) norms of family dispute resolution were embedded in each of these processes, and with what (if any) impacts on different kinds of users and cases; and whether each process appeared to be more or less appropriate for particular kinds of parties. The Project used a mixed methods approach over 3 phases. In Phase 1, we asked a set of structured questions on a nationally representative survey. In Phase 2, we conducted semi-structured interviews with lawyers, mediators and parties with experience of different styles of AFDR. Finally, in Phase 3 recording and analysis of a selection of mediations, collaborative law processes and lawyer-client interviews were undertaken. (Phase 3 data are not capable of full anonymisation and are therefore not available). Findings from the three phases were synthesised in order to arrive at a combined analysis and overall 'map' of family dispute resolution processes and pathways...|$|E
40|$|A person’s {{ethnic or}} {{socio-cultural}} background {{has been shown}} to be an important predictor of a range of social attitudes and behaviours. Ideally, therefore, we want to capture such information alongside other demographic variables in social surveys. However, gathering information about people’s socio-cultural origins as part of a cross-national survey is complicated, not least because of the need to capture complex variation in national, ethnic and other cultural groupings prevalent across countries: The socio-cultural composition of populations vastly differs across countries. The European Social Survey (ESS), a biannual survey of cross-national attitudes and opinions conducted in over 36 European countries since 2001, in 2014 / 15 trialled an approach to collecting data on socio-cultural origins based on a measure of respondents’ self-reported ancestry, i. e. family origins or descent. A questionnaire item was developed which involved countries fielding the item using a country -specific <b>showcard</b> and recoding responses into a newly developed European Standard Classification of Cultural and Ethnic Groups (ESCEG) to create harmonised variables for comparative analysis. Following a thorough evaluation of the item’s performance it has since been decided to include the ancestry item, with some modifications, as a permanent addition to the ESS core questionnaire from Round 8 (2016 / 17) onwards. This report summarises findings from the evaluation conducted into the development and performance of the new ancestry item in ESS Round 7 and the recommendations made for the item’s further development and deployment. It also makes some suggestions on how to code derived variables for statistical analysis. The evaluation concluded that the item worked well across ESS countries and generated meaningful data on respondents’ socio-cultural origins. There were no significant problems with implementation reported. However, the evaluation also highlighted a number of ways in which the item could be improved especially as regards adaptation for different countries. These include improved guidance on translation, revisions to the harmonised code-frame, and more consistent treatment of sub-national socio-cultural groups. This evaluation report will be of interest both to researcher’s wishing to carry out substantive analyses using the new ESS ancestry measure and survey methodologists interested in lessons learned for the development of cross-national questionnaires and classifications...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{validate}} the Pulvers silhouette <b>showcard</b> as a measure of weight status in a population in the African region. This tool is particularly beneficial when scarce resources do not allow for direct anthropometric measurements due to limited survey time or lack of measurement technology in face-to-face general-purpose surveys or in mailed, online, or mobile device-based surveys. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Republic of Seychelles with a sample of 1240 adults. We compared self-reported body sizes measured by Pulvers' silhouette showcards to four measurements of body size and adiposity: body mass index (BMI), body fat percent measured, waist circumference, and waist to height ratio. The accuracy of silhouettes as an obesity indicator was examined using sex-specific receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis and the reliability of this tool to detect socioeconomic gradients in obesity was compared to BMI-based measurements. RESULTS: Our study supports silhouette body size showcards as a valid and reliable survey tool to measure self-reported body size and adiposity in an African population. The mean correlation coefficients of self-reported silhouettes with measured BMI were 0. 80 in men and 0. 81 in women (P[*]<[*] 0. 001). The silhouette showcards also showed high accuracy for detecting obesity as per a BMI[*]≥[*] 30 (Area under curve, AUC: 0. 91 / 0. 89, SE: 0. 01), which was comparable to other measured adiposity indicators: fat percent (AUC: 0. 94 / 0. 94, SE: 0. 01), waist circumference (AUC: 0. 95 / 0. 94, SE: 0. 01), and waist to height ratio (AUC: 0. 95 / 0. 94, SE: 0. 01) amongst men and women, respectively. The use of silhouettes in detecting obesity differences among different socioeconomic groups resulted in similar magnitude, direction, and significance of association between obesity and socioeconomic status as when using measured BMI. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the validity and reliability of silhouettes as a survey tool for measuring obesity in a population in the African region. The ease of use and cost-effectiveness of this tool makes it an attractive alternative to measured BMI in the design of non-face-to-face online- or mobile device-based surveys as well as in-person general-purpose surveys of obesity in social sciences, where limited resources do not allow for direct anthropometric measurements...|$|E
40|$|Fulltext embargoed for: 12 months post date of publicationBACKGROUND: Both {{prostate}} cancer and androgenetic alopecia are strongly age-related {{conditions that are}} considered to be androgen dependent, but studies of the relationship between them have yielded inconsistent results. We aimed to assess whether androgenetic alopecia at ages 20 and 40 years are associated with risk of {{prostate cancer}}. METHODS: At a follow-up of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, men were asked to assess their hair pattern at ages 20 and 40 years relative to eight categories in <b>showcards.</b> Cases were men notified to the Victorian Cancer Registry with prostate cancer diagnosed between cohort enrollment (1990 - 1994) and follow-up attendance (2003 - 2009). Flexible parametric survival models were used to estimate age-varying HRs and predicted cumulative probabilities of prostate cancer by androgenetic alopecia categories. RESULTS: Of 9, 448 men that attended follow-up and provided data on androgenetic alopecia, we identified 476 prostate cancer cases during a median follow-up of 11 years four months. Cumulative probability of prostate cancer was greater at all ages up to 76 years, for men with vertex versus no androgenetic alopecia at age of 40 years. At age of 76 years, the estimated probabilities converged to 0. 15. Vertex androgenetic alopecia at 40 years was also associated with younger age of diagnosis for prostate cancer cases. CONCLUSIONS: Vertex androgenetic alopecia at age of 40 years might be a marker of increased risk of early-onset prostate cancer. IMPACT: If confirmed, these results suggest that the apparently conflicting findings of previous studies might be explained by failure to adequately model the age-varying nature of the association between androgenetic alopecia and prostate cancer.

40|$|Odd pricing {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of pricing goods just below the nearest round figure, for example, $ 9. 99 instead of $ 10. 00, or $ 1, 995 instead of $ 2, 000, to produce higher than expected demand at the price level concerned. Although the practice of odd pricing is prevalent in retailing, {{there is a lack of}} empirical evidence to verify the effectiveness of odd pricing as a strategy to increase demand. This thesis reports the findings of a study designed to test the assumption that odd pricing produces higher than expected demand resulting in a "kinked" demand curve. That is, a demand curve which is inconsistent with the traditional law of demand. Purchase probabilities, used to measure estimated demand for six household products at four price levels, were obtained from a sample of 300 consumers. For each product, <b>showcards</b> featuring two prices, one slightly above an even price point and one slightly below the same price point, were presented to all 300 consumers. These prices served the purpose of creating top and bottom "anchor" points of the demand curve for the product concerned. The sample was further divided into three subsamples of 100 consumers who each viewed either an appropriate even or odd "test" price. This process produced 300 purchase probabilities for each top and bottom "anchor" price and 100 purchase probabilities for each even and odd "test" price, for each of the six products. A demand curve for each product was then produced to examine whether greater than expected demand had occurred at the odd price points. A noticeable trend of greater than expected demand at odd price points occurred for all products tested. This finding offers strong support for the odd pricing assumption. In particular, greater than expected demand for grocery items occurred in response to odd prices. No difference was detected between the odd pricing effect for 95 and 99 cent endings, indicating that, where practical, 99 cent endings achieve the highest gross profit margin obtainable from pricing below the nearest round figure...|$|R

The National Child Development Study (NCDS) originated in the Perinatal Mortality Survey (see SN 5565), which examined social and obstetric factors associated with still birth and infant mortality among over 17, 000 babies born in Britain in one week in March 1958. Surviving members of this birth cohort have been surveyed on eight further occasions in order to monitor their changing health, education, social and economic circumstances - in 1965 at age 7, 1969 at age 11, 1974 at age 16 (the first three sweeps are also held under SN 5565), 1981 (age 23 - SN 5566), 1991 (age 33 - SN 5567), 1999 / 2000 (age 41 / 2 - SN 5578), 2004 - 2005 (age 46 / 47 - SN 5579), 2008 - 2009 (age 50 - SN 6137) and 2013 (age 55 - SN 7669). There have also been surveys of sub-samples of the cohort, the most recent occurring in 1995 (age 37), when a 10 % representative sub-sample was assessed for difficulties with basic skills (SN 4992). Finally, during 2002 - 2004, 9, 340 NCDS cohort members participated in a bio-medical survey, carried out by qualified nurses (SN 5594, available under more restrictive Special Licence access conditions; see catalogue record for details). The bio-medical survey did not cover any of the topics included in the 2004 / 2005 survey. Further NCDS data separate to the main surveys include a response and deaths dataset, parent migration studies, employment, activity and partnership histories, behavioural studies and essays - see the NCDS series page for details. Further information about the NCDS {{can be found on}} the Centre for Longitudinal Studies website. NCDS 37 -Year Sample Survey (basic skills) : This NCDS sample survey was conducted in 1995, between the fifth (NCDS 5) and sixth (NCDS 6) full follow-up surveys of the NCDS cohort (NCDS 5 was conducted in 1991 and NCDS 6 in 1999 - 2000). The 1995 survey aimed to collect details about cohort members' basic skills. It was designed to supplement the information on self-reported literacy and numeracy problems gathered during the NCDS 4 (conducted in 1981) and NCDS 5 follow-ups, with objective assessments of skills in these areas. It provides for a detailed analysis of the extent, antecedents and correlates of basic skills in the NCDS cohort. See documentation for further details. The full NCDS 4 survey is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 5566, NCDS 5 under SN 5567, and NCDS 6 under SN 5578.
