5|$|Peking-opera {{performers}} use {{four main}} skills. The first two are song and speech. The third is dance-acting. This includes pure dance, pantomime, {{and all other}} types of dance. The final <b>skill</b> <b>is</b> combat, which includes both acrobatics and fighting with all manner of weaponry. All of these skills {{are expected to be}} performed effortlessly, in keeping with the spirit of the art form.|$|E

Loman never matures enough to realize that being popular without any substance or <b>skill</b> <b>is</b> meaningless in the end and Miller uses Loman to make his point against the anti-intellectualists. In the end, Loman gives way to the belief that his inability to be a successful man and father is condemning.|$|E
5|$|An {{entry level}} diver must learn the {{techniques}} of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at {{a high risk of}} drowning. A related <b>skill</b> <b>is</b> sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also learn how to use a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.|$|E

5|$|Poohsticks is {{considered}} to be a sport of chance yet some players claim <b>skill</b> <b>is</b> involved. Some strategies involve the way in which the stick is held before it is dropped and trying to find the fastest route in the river. Author Ben Schott outlined a throwing method as a winning strategy in his third book, Schott’s Sporting, Gaming and Idling Miscellany, but his method was dismissed as cheating by competition organisers. In any event, the turbulence around the bridge supports make the path of the stick very difficult to predict and may vary according to the season.|$|E
5|$|The player character's {{proficiency}} with a <b>skill</b> <b>is</b> {{increased by}} practice, training, and study. Practice involves performing the specific actions {{associated with a}} given skill, which gradually raises the character's proficiency in that skill. Raising weapon skills requires striking an enemy with the appropriate weapon; raising armor skills requires being struck while wearing the appropriate type of armor; etc. Training involves paying cash to non-player characters (NPCs) in exchange for immediate proficiency increases in that skill. Study requires reading books found in the game, some of which will immediately raise a skill when read. Weaponry skills affect the character's chance to hit. Armor skills affect the defensive strength of the armor. Other skills affect proficiency at other actions such as potion-making, running, lockpicking, etc.|$|E
5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the turn radius, the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This lean is usually produced by a momentary steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering <b>skill</b> <b>is</b> usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control input on bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E
5000|$|Active <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> <b>skills</b> that <b>are</b> {{used during}} combat or {{that are used}} {{throughout}} an adventure to turn the tides of battle.

50|$|The {{traditional}} Taekkeyon {{system has}} no fixed curriculum. Every student is treated individually {{and thus the}} lesson is always different, although all of the basic <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> eventually covered. The basic <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> taught in temporary patterns, that evolve as the student learns. Basic <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> expounded on and variations of each single <b>skill</b> <b>are</b> then practised, in multiple new combinations. When the student has learned all the variations of the basic movements & techniques, and can intermix all of them proficiently, they're encouraged to perform the Taekkyeon Dance. Taekkyeon is a Ten-year technique.|$|R
5|$|As a {{teenager}} John proves his worth and is gradually granted positions of authority, first as Master of the Falcons, then as Lord Warden of the East Marches and Constable of England. He takes all three positions seriously, devoting {{himself to the}} acquirement of knowledge necessary for effective administration. He comes {{of age in the}} midst of these busy tasks, a ready pupil to the string of men sent to advise him. He helps his father withstand the Glyndŵr and Northern Risings, and wisely gives military command to his more experienced uncle Westmorland. He understands that his administrative <b>skill</b> <b>is</b> more useful than acting as a soldier, and earns the respect of the people under his control by not being unduly harsh with punishment and embarking on negotiations with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana uses an action-based battle system {{similar to}} other entries in the Mana series: {{navigation}} and actions occur in real time within battlefields rendered to the scale of characters within it. After each battle, treasure chests are unlocked which can contain items or new familiars. During battle, the character can attack, switching forms to deliver different attacks, and dodge enemy attacks when correctly timed. During battle, assigned abilities are displayed in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. After each <b>skill</b> <b>is</b> used in battle, a cooldown meter is activated. The skill cannot be used again until the meter is empty. Three types of weapons are available in-game: swords, spears and bows. Each weapon, when equipped, grants a different skill and elemental attribute. The elemental attributes can be used against monsters aligned with a vulnerable element. Enemies can also be weak to attacks using certain weapons. In addition to single-player battles, raid battles allow up to eight players to participate using an online connection.|$|E
5|$|The Rookie's <b>skill</b> <b>is</b> {{put to the}} test, leading chase {{missions}} and surviving an ambush. Eventually, the Human Liberation Front's secret base is discovered in Aeropolis II tower by following the enemy supply line, along with the terrorists' intentions of using a nuclear reactor. Ishikawa informs Aramaki that {{an official of the}} Energy Ministry named Sawamura has been in contact with Zebra and is connected to Megatech Body Corporation. While conducting the raid on the enemy's base, the reactor begins to overload. In order to shut it down, squad leader Motoko Kusanagi attempts to remove the protective barrier from an access point nearby, {{as the rest of the}} team search for the other building's control room. After disarming the reactor, Kusanagi locates the leader on top of the tower. Batou and Togusa encounter obstacles that prevent them from moving to the top, leaving the Rookie as the only available member. Once he reaches the top, he engages the leader in combat and defeats him in a free fall battle off of the tower.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Youth sport {{programs}} {{have been designed to}} facilitate positive development of young sports people by teaching life <b>skills.</b> It <b>is</b> unclear which life <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> needed by adolescent athletes and which life <b>skills</b> should <b>be</b> included in youth sport programs. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to explore how life <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> defined, which life skills British adolescent athletes need, and which life <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> the most important. Design and method: Nineteen adolescent athletes, 10 coaches, 4 experts in sport psychology (pilot group) and 5 graduate students (pilot group) participated in a series of focus groups. An inductive analysis revealed how life <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> defined, which life skills British adolescent athletes need, and of these <b>skills</b> which <b>are</b> the most important. Results: Life <b>skills</b> <b>were</b> defined as ranges of transferable skills needed for everyday life, by everybody, that help people thrive. Participants described the need for interpersonal skills including social skills, respect, leadership, family interactions, and communication. Personal skills including self-organization, discipline, self-reliance, goal setting, managing performance outcomes, and motivation, were also reported. Social <b>skills</b> <b>were</b> identified as the most important life skills.

25|$|Generalization is the {{expansion}} of a student's performance ability beyond the initial conditions set for acquisition of a skill. Generalization can occur across people, places, and materials used for teaching. For example, once a <b>skill</b> <b>is</b> learned in one setting, with a particular instructor, and with specific materials, the <b>skill</b> <b>is</b> taught in more general settings with more variation from the initial acquisition phase. For example, if a student has successfully mastered learning colors at the table, the teacher may take the student around the house or his school and then generalize the skill in these more natural environments with other materials. Behavior analysts have spent considerable amount of time studying factors that lead to generalization.|$|E

5000|$|Perceptual-Motor <b>Skills</b> <b>are</b> <b>skills</b> {{learned by}} {{movement}} patterns guided by sensory inputs. There <b>are</b> closed <b>skills</b> and open <b>skills.</b> Closed <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> <b>skills</b> learned such as dance. A ballerina learns a {{specific set of}} moves and doesn’t stray from the exact routine, which is why it is called a closed skill; there is one option. Open <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> <b>skills</b> that require more flexibility in learning such as team sports. A person learning how to play football learns multiple drills, strategies, and practices scrimmages in order to learn how to work in multiple types of environments. Because no football game is the same, and a person can’t know going into a game the exact steps the other team is going to take, open <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> required to become successful. Cognitive <b>skills</b> also <b>are</b> a part of kinesthetic learning, perceptual learning, and skill memories. Some people learn better in an environment that is more hands-on, and this builds their cognitive skills as well. Cognitive <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> <b>skills</b> which require you to solve problems or apply strategies rather than to move your body based on what you perceive. [...] Solving a puzzle would an example of a cognitive skill.|$|R
50|$|Passive <b>skills</b> <b>are</b> <b>skills</b> that {{a player}} can learn {{and never have}} to use at all {{because they are in}} {{constant}} effect as soon as they are learned.
