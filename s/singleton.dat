5|$|The first presenters of Blue Peter were Christopher Trace and Leila Williams. Trace {{presented}} for nearly nine years, and Williams for just {{over three years}} (although no footage of her has been retained by the BBC). In the early days, as the show ran continuously on a weekly basis, other presenters occasionally stepped in to give the regular team a break. Artist Tony Hart and actress Ann Taylor both presented the show either in place of either Trace or Williams, or sometimes in place of both, with Taylor replacing Williams for six weeks in 1959 and presenting the show at least once alone, as did Hart. When Williams was fired from the show in 1962 following a series of spats with a newly appointed producer, Trace continued to present the show alone or with one-off presenters until a replacement was found. The role went to Anita West, who presented sixteen editions over a four-month period in 1962—the shortest tenure of any full-time presenter—before abruptly resigning due to her imminent divorce, a reason she hid from the producers. Her tenure was so short that no footage from her time on Blue Peter exists in the BBC Archives, although footage of her audition remains, along with that of Valerie <b>Singleton</b> and other auditionees. It was not until 1998 that West was officially recognised as a former presenter. John Noakes is the longest-serving presenter, having presented the show for over twelve years, and Konnie Huq is the longest-serving female presenter, with a tenure of over ten years, beating Valerie <b>Singleton</b> by three months. However, although <b>Singleton</b> left the series full-time in 1972 to present the spin-off series Blue Peter Special Assignment, she continued to be an occasional presenter until 1975. Singleton's last 'official' appearance on the show came on 20 October 1975 although she was also credited with appearing on the 1975 'review of the year' programme, broadcast on 29 December 1975 Sandra Michaels presented the show twice in April 1964 {{in the absence of}} <b>Singleton</b> and impressed producer Edward Barnes enough that he considered replacing <b>Singleton,</b> but Michaels turned him down and he opted to carry on with <b>Singleton,</b> something he admits in hindsight he was glad he did. The youngest presenter of Blue Peter was Yvette Fielding, who was eighteen when she began presenting, and the oldest was John Noakes, who was forty-four when he left. Only one presenter, Peter Duncan, had two stints of presenting, his first being from 1980 to 1984, and his second being from 1985 to 1986.|$|E
40|$|This study uses a {{large and}} {{representative}} sample of adolescents to test the theoretically informed hypotheses comparing adolescent <b>singletons</b> {{with those who have}} siblings. The results found that, for academic related outcomes (educational expectations, time spent on homework, and self-reported grades), there are no differences between <b>singletons</b> and firstborns who have any number of younger siblings. <b>Singletons</b> are also not different from laterborns from two-child families. In contrast, <b>singletons</b> are more advantageous compared to laterborns who have two or more siblings on educational expectations and grades. <b>Singletons</b> also spend more time on homework than laterborns who have three or more siblings. For psychosocial outcomes (psychological distress, susceptibility to negative peer pressure, and problem behaviors), <b>singletons</b> are not different from both firstborns and laterborns with any number of siblings. The findings suggest that <b>singletons</b> are not at any disadvantage compared to their peers who have siblings and they enjoy some advantages over laterborns from medium to large families on academic related outcomes...|$|R

This study compared <b>singletons</b> born after cryopreservation with <b>singletons</b> born after fresh IVF cycles and <b>singletons</b> born to women in the general population. Data were collected for Swedish IVF treatments during the years 20022006. All <b>singletons</b> from single embryo transfer (SET) and double embryo transfer (DET) after cryopreserved (n 2348) and fresh cycles (n 8944) were included and cross-linked with the Swedish Medical Birth Registry and compared with all <b>singletons</b> born after spontaneous conception (n 571 914). Main outcomes were preterm and very preterm birth and low and very low birthweight (VLBW). Other outcomes were small for gestational age, large for gestational age (LGA), perinatal mortality and maternal outcomes. <b>Singletons</b> from cryopreserved SET/DET or cryopreserved SET had increased rates of extreme preterm birth compared with <b>singletons</b> from the general population. A lower rate of LBW was found for cryopreserved SET/DET <b>singletons</b> compared with <b>singletons</b> from fresh cycles; however, {{a higher rate of}} perinatal mortality was detected. The rates of LGA and macrosomia were increased for cryopreserved SET/DET <b>singletons</b> when compared with those from fresh cycles and the general population. For maternal outcomes, a higher rate of pre-eclampsia was noted for pregnancies from cryopreserved cycles compared with those from fresh cycles or the general population, but the rate of placenta praevia was lower in pregnancies from cryopreserved cycles compared with those from fresh cycles. The obstetric outcome of <b>singletons</b> after cryopreservation was slightly poorer when compared with the general population. In comparison with fresh cycles, the outcome varied.

40|$|To {{investigate}} whether salient visual <b>singletons</b> capture attention when they appear outside the current endogenous attentional focus, we measured the N 2 pc component {{as a marker}} of attentional capture in a visual search task where target or nontarget <b>singletons</b> were presented at locations previously cued as task-relevant, or in the uncued irrelevant hemifield. In two experiments, targets were either defined by color or {{by a combination of}} color and shape. The N 2 pc was elicited both for attended <b>singletons</b> and for <b>singletons</b> on the uncued side, demonstrating that focused endogenous attention cannot prevent attentional capture by salient unattended visual events.

40|$|Objective: We propose an {{interpretation}} of the paradoxically better survival rate among low-birth-weight twins compared with low-birth-weight <b>singletons.</b> Study design: We used data from Belgian birth and death certificates for 1983 and 1984. The data include 229, 964 <b>singletons,</b> 2175 first twins, and 2153 second twins. Weight-specific perinatal mortality rates of twins and <b>singletons</b> were compared; the birth-weight distributions were adjusted to a single mean and SD. Results: After adjustment, mortality rates at every weight were higher for twins than for <b>singletons.</b> Conclusions: The appearance of better survival among small twins compared with small <b>singletons</b> disappears after adjustment to relative birth-weight. There is a large risk resulting from twinning that falls on all twins, regardless of their weight. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5|$|In 1882, Gould {{was elected}} to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Patrick's Plains (renamed <b>Singleton</b> in 1894). Initially an {{opponent}} of the coalition associated with Henry Parkes and John Robertson, he later supported Robertson's government in 1885. By 1887 he was supporting his career with his own legal practice in <b>Singleton</b> and Sydney, and when the party system came into being in New South Wales in that year he identified as a Free Trader. In 1889 he was appointed Minister for Justice under Parkes, serving until 1891; he held the position again under George Reid from 1894 to 1898. During the first period of his ministry he became involved in a dispute with the Chief Justice, Sir Frederick Darley, over requests for improved court accommodation and a contested punishment for contempt of two witnesses. Despite embarrassing his premier, he remained close with Parkes throughout his state career and in later years frequently gave speeches in his memory.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{analyzes}} grouping between <b>singletons</b> (line elements {{popping out}} by orientation gradient) when they segregate from textures of uniformly oriented line elements. In the first experiment three adjacent <b>singletons</b> formed a texture bar; {{in the second}} experiment the distance between two <b>singletons</b> to be grouped was manipulated. The observer's task was to discriminate {{the orientation of the}} global pattern made by the <b>singletons.</b> The results and the explanations suggested are that: (i) an inner gradient within the texture bar (when the <b>singletons</b> are reciprocally orthogonal) operates only at short distances and enhances discrimination, indicating an initial stage of texture segregation based on local processing. (ii) Spatial interactions between parallel <b>singletons</b> are present at short distances and reduce discrimination. (iii) An interruption of background flow (directed along the orientation of background line elements) produced by the grouped pattern when orthogonal to it, enhances discrimination; this effect is present at both short and large distances between <b>singletons,</b> indicating a global process. (iv) Spatial interactions are present between parallel <b>singletons</b> even at large distances and independently of background orientation, suggesting that grouping generates a figural context within which features to be bound together interact. Moreover, flow interruption and figural context were absent in a detection task, thereby suggesting their specific involvement in grouping and figure binding. Overall, the results may indicate that grouping operates on already segmented line elements, across different orientations and over both short and long distances in between...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe first aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} developmental trajectories of Attention Problems in twins followed from age 6 to 12  years. Second, we investigated whether <b>singletons</b> follow similar trajectories. Maternal longitudinal ratings on the Attention Problems (AP) subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist were obtained for a sample of 12, 486 twins from the Netherlands Twin Register and for a general population sample of 1, 346 <b>singletons.</b> Trajectories were analyzed by growth mixture modeling in twins, and compared with <b>singletons.</b> Teacher ratings on the AP subscale of the Teachers' Report Form were available for 7, 179 twins and 1, 211 <b>singletons,</b> and were used for cross-sectional mean comparisons at each age. All analyses were conducted for boys and girls separately. We identified three linear trajectories in both boys and girls, i. e., stable low (62 - 71 %), low-increasing (15 - 18 %), and high-decreasing (14 - 21 %). <b>Singletons</b> followed three identical trajectories, with similar class proportions. Teacher ratings yielded no differences in mean levels of Attention Problems between twins and <b>singletons.</b> The development of Attention Problems from age 6 to 12  years can be characterized by stable low, low-increasing, and high-decreasing developmental trajectories. Twins and <b>singletons</b> are comparable with respect to the development of Attention Problems in childhood...|$|R
