2500|$|The Urban Flood Prevention and Drainage Program (APL) is {{the result}} of a {{government}} commitment to flood prevention and risk management. The program places emphasis on risk prevention, and developing a strategy that guides targeted Provinces from protection to a full risk management scheme. [...] This program targets urban areas from the most exposed provinces at a cost of US$200 million. The first phase of this project was directed towards the City of Buenos Aires where a portion of the funding was a $130 million direct loan from the World Bank. Overall government strategy beginning in 1992 has aimed at evolving from a disaster response to a risk prevention approach, introducing a water basin approach and strengthening of the institutions. The program is being implemented within the framework of the Buenos Aires Hydraulic Master Plan, which involves the entire city in implementing non-structural measures and then the Maldonado Basin for the first stage of the <b>structural</b> <b>measures.</b> Planned investments will benefit about 500,000 people over an area that suffers losses estimated at US$50 million annually.|$|E

We propase a <b>structural</b> <b>measure</b> of the welfare cost of fluctuations, and quantify {{the role played by}} dinamics and non-linearities in assessing this cost for some versions of the one sector stochastic growth model.

40|$|We try {{to better}} {{understand}} the comparative advantages of <b>structural</b> and behavioral <b>measures</b> of deregulation in electricity markets, an eminent policy issue for which the experimental evidence is scant and problematic. In the present paper we investigate theoretically and experimentally the effects of the introduction of a forward market on competition in electricity markets. We compare this scenario with the best alternative, reducing concentration by adding one more competitor by divestiture. Our work contributes to the literature by introducing more realistic cost configurations, teasing apart number and asset effect, and studying numbers of competitors that reflect better the market concentration in the European electricity industries. Our experimental data suggest that introducing a forward market has a positive effect on the aggregate supply in markets with two or three major competitors, configurations typical for both the newly accessed and the old European Union member states. Introducing a forward market also increases efficiency. Our data furthermore suggest, in contrast to previous findings, that the effects of introducing a forward market is stronger than adding one more competitor both in markets with two, and particularly three, producers. Our data thus suggest that the behavioral measure of introducing a forward market is more effective than the <b>structural</b> <b>measure</b> of adding one more competitor by divestiture. Thus competition authorities should, in line with EU law, focus on the behavioral measure of introducing, or at least facilitating the emergence of, forward markets rather than on the <b>structural</b> <b>measure</b> of lowering market concentration by divestiture. economics experiments; market power; competition; forward markets; EU electricity market...|$|R

Calculated inherent flood vulnerabilities were compared to the conventional flood vulnerability-resilience indices. The proposed inherent flood vulnerability showed more reasonable results.
