40|$|An {{apparatus}} for {{the observation}} of <b>streaming</b> <b>birefringence</b> with photoelectric detection, in which the output signal near the null is linear {{with respect to the}} angular distance to the null, was built and tested. It was found that such an apparatus is able to establish the position of the isocline with an accuracy of one degree for a relative retardation of 10 ^(- 9). The apparatus was subsequently used to study the <b>streaming</b> <b>birefringence</b> of tobacco mosaic virus and of mixtures of tobacco mosaic virus and southern bean mosaic virus. Accurate measurements of the angle of isocline of both types of solutions showed that no significant difference exists between the experimental and theoretical results, once all the sources of extraneous birefringences are accounted for. The amount of retardation of the mixtures was found to be lower than that for pure tobacco mosaic virus at equal concentrations of the latter and equal velocity gradients. This experimental result is explained by considering that the random motion of the spherical particles interacts with the orderly rotation of the rod-like particles, decreasing the amount of aligned material, and thus the amount of retardation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Centrifugally {{purified}} {{samples of}} tobacco mosaic virus {{were subjected to}} intense sound vibrations of 9, 000 cycles per second for 0, 2, 8, 16, 32, and 64 minutes. The viscosity and <b>stream</b> <b>birefringence</b> of the samples decreased with time of sonic treatment, but no chemical changes were found. Electron micrographs of the samples show that the particles are broken perpendicular to their long axis. In the untreated sample 62 per cent of the particles are about 280 mµ in length. As sonic treatment continued, the number of particles of this length decreased exponentially with time, the number half this length increased and then decreased, {{and the number of}} quarter length particles subsequently increased and then decreased. The biological activity of the samples, as determined by the half leaf lesion method, decreased exponentially with time of sonic treatment with a rate constant given by k = 0. 13 min. – 1. A correlation exists between the size distributions and biological activity and shows that only the particles of length 280 mµ are the biologically active units. Tobacco mosaic virus particles can be made to aggregate end-to-end when the material is heated at its isoelectric point and reheated after being brought back to pH 7. Material which was not sonic treated and was made to aggregate showed reduced biological activity, but the activity was increased when the aggregated material was subjected to strong mechanical stirring. Material which was sonic treated for 32 minutes and which was made to aggregate showed the same biological activity as the material which was sonic treated but not aggregated...|$|R

40|$|An {{optical system}} capable of {{providing}} precise pointwise measurements of <b>streaming</b> <b>birefringence</b> (SBR) was used to explore the flow of dilute solutions of tobacco mosaic virus between rotating eccentric cylinders. The local relationship between the observed optical anisotropy {{and the rate of}} strain tensor calculated from the theoretical solution for the particular flow field was studied. The relationship is apparently in accord with the conclusions of the orientation theory for a sufficiently dilute solution of rigid macromolecules in generalized two-dimensional flow. The general problem of using <b>streaming</b> <b>birefringence</b> of colloidal solutions to visualize two-dimensional laminar flows is considered. The conclusion is reached that a clear and unambiguous kinematic interpretation of SBR in such fluids is possible only for a restricted class of flows. If the flow is such that the angle between the streamline and the principal rate of strain axes is not less than 35 °, then to a good approximation SBR can give the magnitude and direction of the principal strain rates. This information, it is shown, is sufficient to permit calculation of the entire velocity field if the velocity is known on all boundaries. In the most general flow situations, SBR of colloidal solutions cannot indicate the orientation of the rate of strain tensor. SBR in certain birefringent pure liquids may yield the necessary information even in the most general flows. These pure liquids hold promise of being valuable flow visualization agents...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A new {{measurement}} technique allowing a direct {{assessment of a}} three-dimensional shear stress field is proposed. The method is based on liquids exhibiting the optical effect of <b>streaming</b> <b>birefringence</b> that is visualized using the apparatus called polariscope. Spherical reflecting particles are added into the birefringent fluid and illuminated with a polarized, monochromatic light sheet. Three kinds of the light sources were tested: CW-Laser diode, low-pressure sodium lamps and light emitting diodes. In order to resolve a 3 D shear stress field, a test volume is scanned {{by a set of}} parallel light sheets. Each sheet is acquired by two identical synchronized cameras from opposite directions that results in two different images. The light intensity in each image {{is a measure of the}} optical effect of <b>streaming</b> <b>birefringence</b> on the way of the light from reflecting particles to the sensor chip of each camera. By a combination of two images for one light sheet and one final image with a light transmission through the test volume an optical effect of the birefringence on the way between light sheet and camera may be separated and a 3 D resolution of the effect in a test volume may be solved. The method is a tomography, but without a use of multi-projectional line-of-sight measurements. This paper describes the first steps of the development of this {{new measurement}} technique.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of high polymers in solution {{has been}} extensively investigated by many methods, but the diffusion of high polymers has received little attention experimentally, and limited {{progress has been made}} in its theoretical treatment. According to these theories, the rate of diffusion is governed in large measure by the shape of the polymer chain which, however, need not be the same in different solvents. Evidence for a change of shape in different solvents is obtained indirectly from experiments on viscosity, osmotic pressure, sedimentation velocity, and <b>streaming</b> <b>birefringence,</b> while direct evidence is provided by measurements of light scattering. Experimental studies on the diffusion of high polymers should therefore be of interest from two points of view, (i) to provide data by which to examine the validity of existing theories, and (ii) to obtain additional information about the extent to which a polymer may alter its configuration in different solvents.

40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} into three dimensional fluid flow {{has been conducted}} which combines the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with the experimental phenomenon of <b>Streaming</b> <b>Birefringence.</b> A versatile flow channel was designed and built for use {{in conjunction with a}} circular polariscope. The experimental liquid used was an aqueous solution of a dye, commercially known as Milling Yellow NGS with the addition of Sodium Chloride. To extract the flow fields, six image phase stepping photoelasticity was used over backward and forward steps, and flows around a cylinder, and full-field fringe data were obtained. This method needs laminar flow regimes and the Reynolds number of the flow was around 10. To allow direct comparisons of the CFD solutions with the optical results, a macro (UDF) was written to interpret the flow field results from a (FLUENT 6) CFD simulation. This integrated the shear stresses across the flow field and banded the results into fringes. A good correlation between the simulated fringes and the shearstrain rate was obtained from these observations...|$|E

Thymus nucleic acid 1 is generally prepared and used in the form of its sodium salt, sodium thymonucleate, which is soluble in water.

It will be proposed to the "Journal of Modern Physics " (JMP) We start recalling with critical eyes the mathematical methods used in gauge theory and prove that they are not coherent with continuum mechanics, in particular the analytical mechanics of rigid bodies or hydrodynamics, though using the same group theoretical methods and despite the well known couplings existing between elasticity and electromagnetism (piezzoelectricity, photoelasticity, <b>streaming</b> <b>birefringence).</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to avoid such contradictions by using new mathematical methods coming from the formal theory of systems of partial differential equations and Lie pseudogroups.

Weyl in 1918 for electromagnetism by using respectively the group of rigid motions of space or the conformal group of space-time. Meanwhile we explain why the Poincaré "duality scheme" existing between "geometry " and "physics" has to do with homological algebra and algebraic analysis.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{determining}} the orientation distribution function for rigid particles of arbitrary shape is formulated in a general stochastic approach to consider the influence of any acting orientation mechanism, stochastic or deterministic. The effect of the various orientation mechanisms on the partial differential equation of the problem, an equation of the Fokker-Planck type, is analyzed. The question of linearity or non-linearity of the superposition of the effects due to different orientation mechanisms is examined. The orientation of rigid ellipsoidal particles in uniform shear flow is studied in detail, for different cases of acting orientation mechanisms. When only the viscous stresses act on the particles, {{the problem for the}} orientation distribution function becomes a deterministic first-order initial value problem, and its solution displays periodic behavior. In the case of macromolecules, when the Brownian influence is predominant, we examine the effect of a third orientation mechanism acting on the macromolecules in addition to the viscous stresses and the Brownian impulses. In Couette flow between concentric cylinders, the third orientation mechanism {{is considered to be a}} deterministic force field in the radial direction x, varying linearly with x. The steady state orientation distribution function is then determined to the third order, and the theory of <b>streaming</b> <b>birefringence</b> of a dilute suspension of rigid ellipsoidal macromolecules in Couette flow is generalized to include the effect of the additional influence. The direction of the isocline and the amount of birefringence are calculated to the second order. When spherical macromolecules are added to the suspension in increasing concentration, the effect of hydrodynamic interactions between the two species on the orientation of the ellipsoidal particles is examined in Couette flow. It is shown that an effect of the presence of the spheres is to decrease the drift velocity of the ellipsoids [...] and thus decrease the amount of birefringence [...] and that the effect can be described as a decrease in the effective velocity gradient. The theoretical result for this decrease is in good agreement with experimental results for sphere concentrations comparable to the concentration of ellipsoids. On the other hand, as the concentration of spheres increases, the effect of their presence on the rotational diffusion constant of the asymmetrical particles can be large enough to reverse the trend and lead to a positive variation of the amount of birefringence with sphere concentration...|$|E
