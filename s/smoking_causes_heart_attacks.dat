40|$|This Qualitative Eurobarometer study {{investigating}} a {{second generation of}} tobacco packaging health warnings was commissioned by the Directorate- General for Health and Consumers (DG SANCO) of the European Commission. The study consisted of a programme of 270 in-depth interviews conducted amongst current, ex- and (amongst the 15 - 17 age group only) non-smokers across all twenty-seven Member States of the European Union. The overall aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate 24 proposed new health warnings to establish which were likely to have the greatest impact, how the messages could be modified to enhance their impact and which fourteen messages would represent the best selection for adoption. Overall, the fourteen health warnings we recommended adopting are: • Smoking causes 9 out of 10 lung cancers (1) • Smoking causes mouth and throat cancer (2) • Smoking doubles the risk of cervical cancer (3) • Smoking destroys your lungs (5) • <b>Smoking</b> <b>causes</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> (7) • Smoking can kill your unborn child (12) • Your smoke harms your children, family and friends (13) • Quit now – stay alive for your children (15) • Smoking makes it harder to have children (18) • Smoking reduces your sexual performance (19) • Smoking causes strokes and severe disability (8) • Smoking causes leg amputations (9) OR Smoking causes leukaemia (4) • Smoking causes blindness (10) OR Smokers die younger (22) If you smoke, your children will smoke (14...|$|E
40|$|The aims {{of current}} study were {{to assess the}} level of tobacco knowledge, anti-tobacco {{messages}} and major information channels in Zhejiang. Face-to-face {{interviews were conducted with}} 2112 adults in Zhejiang. Data on demographic information, smoking status, tobacco knowledge, anti-tobacco messages and major information channels was collected. The findings revealed that only 31. 87 % of the population were aware that <b>smoking</b> could <b>cause</b> all three diseases (stoke, heart disease, and lung cancer), 86. 09 % were aware that <b>smoking</b> <b>causes</b> lung cancer, 46. 43 % and 42. 40 % were aware that <b>smoking</b> <b>causes</b> stroke and <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> respectively. Residence and education level had significant effects on awareness, while the effects of smoking status, gender, age, and household monthly income were not significant. There were five major information channels as follows: television (67. 52 %), newspapers or magazines (40. 79 %), billboards (30. 02 %), public walls (24. 72), and radio (23. 79 %). Respondents got the following anti-tobacco messages from mass media: "No smoking in public" (66. 34 %), "No smoking in front of other people" (35. 18 %) and "Not offering cigarettes to one another" (22. 82 %). The tobacco knowledge among residents in Zhejiang province is relatively poor. Improved information channels and content of anti-tobacco messages are necessary to increase the public's tobacco knowledge, particularly among rural residents and people with less education...|$|R

The heart disease is the most common chronic disease of the coronary arteries is called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis occurs when a build-up of plaque or cholesterol deposits on artery walls. Over time, plaque can accumulate, harden and narrow the arteries and impede blood flow to the heart. Coronary artery disease or coronary artery disease (CAD) is the basically can <b>caused</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks,</b> strokes, various <b>heart</b> disease including congestive heart failure and most cardiovascular disease in general. A blockage in one or more coronary arteries can <b>cause</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> suddenly. In addition, diseased arteries also tend to experience sudden muscle contractions. Thus, a piece of a blood crust can form a contraction, release chemicals which then result in narrowing the artery wall, triggering a <b>heart</b> <b>attack.</b> If the working system of the heart is damage, the normal rhythm of the heart can become chaotic and the heart began to tremble with uncertainty or experiencing fibrillation.
