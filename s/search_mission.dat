25|$|Pressed by {{pack ice}} Eira was holed and {{subsequently}} sank off Cape Flora on 21August. Although men, stores and boats were saved, ice hindered the expedition from reaching Eira Lodge so instead the men built a turf and stone hut at Cape Flora. Coal and salt was {{brought from the}} lodge on 1September, which meant that they had sufficient food, including fresh meat to ward off scurvy. The cottage was subdivided into two sections for officers and crew respectively. Twenty-four walruses and thirty-four polar bears {{were killed by the}} expedition during the winter. Meteorological reports were recorded, but lack of sleds made exploration difficult. The group set off in their boats for Novaya Zemlya on 21June 1882. They reached a beach on Matochkin Strait on 2August, where they rendezvoused with the Willem Barents and the British vessels Kara and Hope, which had been dispatched on a <b>search</b> <b>mission.</b>|$|E
25|$|The state {{government}} of Andhra Pradesh and the Government of India launched {{one of the}} largest search and rescue operations {{in the history of the}} country. The state's security officials mentioned that bad weather was hindering the search and rescue efforts. The Home Ministry of India dispatched 5000 CRPF soldiers for the operation while the Defence Ministry of India ordered the Indian Air Force to comb the area using low altitude planes and the Sukhoi-30MKI equipped with thermal imaging systems. In addition, police personnel from six districts were involved in the ground search. Andhra Pradesh's elite anti-Naxal troops, Greyhounds, were also deployed in the area, owing to their extreme familiarity with the jungle terrain of the area. Local tribal residents from this part of the state assisted with the <b>search</b> <b>mission.</b> Patrol parties also combed the Krishna river for the remains of the helicopter. ISRO's RISAT-2 satellite was also deployed to search the area, but the 41 high-resolution images of the area were unable to trace the helicopter.|$|E
500|$|The most {{significant}} {{event of the}} tour occurred in late July 1954. Chinese airplanes had shot down a Douglas DC-4 passenger aircraft operated by Cathay Pacific Airways near Hainan Island off the Chinese coast. The Chinese military had believed {{it to be a}} Taiwanese military airplane. Philippine Sea was ordered into the area as part of a <b>search</b> <b>mission</b> to recover some of the 19 on board. While engaged in the <b>search</b> <b>mission,</b> a flight of the ship's Douglas AD Skyraiders was attacked by two Chinese fighter aircraft. The Skyraiders returned fire and shot down the airplanes.

500|$|After the {{departure}} of Bligh's launch, Christian divided the personal effects of the departed loyalists among the remaining crew and threw the breadfruit plants into the sea. He recognised that Bligh could conceivably survive to report the mutiny, and that anyway the non-return of Bounty would occasion a <b>search</b> <b>mission,</b> with Tahiti as its first port of call. Christian therefore headed Bounty towards the small island of Tubuai, some [...] south of Tahiti. Tubuai had been discovered and roughly charted by Cook; except for a single small channel, it was entirely surrounded by a coral reef and could, Christian surmised, be easily defended against any attack from the sea.|$|E
500|$|The La Pérouse's {{expedition}} {{was last}} seen on 10 March 1788 as it left Botany Bay in New Holland, Australia. It had been observed by ships of the First Fleet of convicts from England {{under the command of}} Arthur Phillip who was just leaving for Port Jackson after deciding that Botany Bay was unsuitable for settlement. In 1791 France’s National Assembly decided to send out a <b>search</b> <b>mission</b> led by Bruni d’Entrecasteaux. With Thouin’s recommendation Delahaye, who was at this time principal assistant gardener at the botany school of the Jardin du Roi, was invited to join the expedition's team of [...] "savants" [...] (more than ten scientists, engineers and artists) as the expedition's gardener. Thouin described Delahaye as “ ... strong, vigorous and well-suited for voyages. Gentle, honest and of an exact probity. Active, hard-working and passionately loving his calling. Knowing by theory and by practice the processes of gardening and knowing very well the plants cultivated in the Jardin du Roi.” Delahaye's annual salary on the expedition, paid by the navy, was 1000 livres (24 livres were equivalent to the gold coin, the Louis d'or), and he was reimbursed 1,236 livres for equipment. As a lowly gardener he was not permitted accommodation with the savants or to dine with the officers. Throughout the expedition he worked with diligence and honesty, keeping meticulous horticultural notes in his journal. Thouin wanted Delahaye to improve his schooling on the expedition and recommended that Delahaye study Latin, try to translate the works of Linnaeus and to read and write in French. His reading included Pierre Bulliard’s Dictionairre Elementaire de Botanique (1783) and the works of Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau (1700–1782) who published works on forestry, naval architecture (especially relating to timber), agriculture, fruit tree cultivation, seed conservation and insect pests affecting seeds. Delahaye arrived in Brest, ready for the ship's departure, with four cases of garden seeds, one of fruit tree nuts, one containing gardening tools and another gardener’s clothing.|$|E

2500|$|During {{exercises}} in 2012 and 2013, and an overseas deployment to Japan, the P-8 reportedly exhibited radar, sensor integration, and data transfer problems, leading to additional testing. In January 2014, the Pentagon's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation office called the P-8A [...] "ineffective" [...] for large area ISR and anti-submarine warfare missions, {{and said that}} the initial aircraft were not ready for deployment. The same report found that the P-8 was effective at the small-area <b>search</b> <b>mission,</b> and with much better range, speed, and reliability than older aircraft. Pentagon acquisition undersecretary Frank Kendall disputed the report, saying that although its findings are factual, it did not acknowledge future capability upgrades for anti-submarine and wider-area surveillance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{high number}} of losses {{resulted}} in the formation at Jorhat in July 1943 {{of one of the}} first search and rescue organizations, nicknamed [...] "Blackie's Gang." [...] A former test pilot and a Hump veteran, Capt. John L. [...] "Blackie" [...] Porter directed the unit using C-47s borrowed from airlift units that were crewed by a dozen former barnstormers and enlisted personnel armed with submachine guns and hand grenades. [...] "Blackie's Gang" [...] accounted for virtually every crewman recovered in 1943, including CBS News correspondent Eric Sevareid and 19 others forced to parachute on 2 August. The unit moved to Chabua on 25 October and was given official status and allotted two C-47s and several L-5 Sentinel liaison planes for rescue pickups. Porter recruited volunteer medics to parachute into crash sites to aid injured crewmen. In late November he added two B-25 Mitchells to his small fleet from aircraft that had been consigned to a salvage field. Porter was killed in action on 10 December 1943, when his B-25 was set on fire by Japanese Zero fighters during a <b>search</b> <b>mission</b> and crashed at the Indian border trying to return to base.|$|E
2500|$|Search {{aircraft}} were dispatched from Ladd Field on 21 February. [...] There {{were two}} B-29's (45-21871 and 45-21761), one B-17 Flying Fortress and one long-range OA-10A Catalina reconnaissance aircraft. [...] Also available was an Air Transport Command C-74 Globemaster {{which was at}} Ladd in temporary status from Morrison Field, Florida performing cold weather testing. All other long range aircraft in Alaska were alerted for the search, and 9 B-29's of the 28th Bomb Group at Elmendorf Field responded to the call {{to aid in the}} search, and arrived at Ladd Field on 22 February 1947. However, since these aircraft were not equipped with bomb bay fuel tanks, they did not have sufficient range to fly to Greenland. [...] The aircraft returned to their proper station on 23 February 1947. [...] The first plane to take-off on the search was the B-17, flown by personnel of the 5th Emergency Rescue Squadron. This plane went directly to Point Barrow and originally was to have participated in the coastline search, but due to later developments returned to Ladd Field and was not active in the <b>search</b> <b>mission.</b>|$|E
