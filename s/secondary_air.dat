Sawdust was partially burned in a primary combustion chamber while feeding with primary air at 30 % of stoichiometric condition. An incomplete product of combustion flowed into the secondary combustion chamber to be re-burned with preheated <b>secondary</b> combustion <b>air.</b> It was discovered that increased <b>secondary</b> combustion <b>air</b> temperature affected {{the characteristics of the}} operation of the secondary burner and reduced its fuel consumption to a factor of 7. 7 and 22. 9 % at a preheated <b>secondary</b> combustion <b>air</b> temperature of 500 oC and 1000 oC, respectively...|$|R

25|$|The second {{generation}} air system targeted high reduction. In 1954 CE moved their <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> from about 1 m below the liquor guns to about 2 m above them. The air ratios and temperatures remained the same, but to increase mixing 50m/s <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> velocities were used. CE changed their frontwall/backwall secondary to tangential firing at that time. In tangential air system the air nozzles {{are in the}} furnace corners. The preferred method {{is to create a}} swirl of almost the total furnace width. In large units the swirl caused left and right imbalances. This kind of air system with increased dry solids managed to increase lower furnace temperatures and achieve reasonable reduction. B had already adopted the three-level air feeding by then.|$|E

25|$|The three-level {{air system}} was a {{significant}} improvement, but better results were required. Use of CFD models offered a new insight of air system workings. The first {{to develop a new}} air system was Kvaerner (Tampella) with their 1990 multilevel <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> in Kemi, Finland, which was later adapted to a string of large recovery boilers. Kvaerner also patented the four level air system, where additional air level is added above the tertiary air level. This enables significant NOx reduction.|$|E
25|$|Vertical {{air mixing}} {{was invented by}} Erik Uppstu. His idea is to turn {{traditional}} vertical mixing to horizontal mixing. Closely spaced jets will form a flat plane. In traditional boilers this plane has been formed by <b>secondary</b> <b>air.</b> By placing the planes to 2/3 or 3/4 arrangement improved mixing results. Vertical air has a potential to reduce NOx as staging air helps in decreasing emissions. In vertical air mixing, primary air supply is arranged conventionally. Rest of the air ports are placed on interlacing 2/3 or 3/4 arrangement.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} air {{system in the}} 1940s and 1950s consisted of a two level arrangement; primary air for maintaining the reduction zone and <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> below the liquor guns for final oxidation. The recovery boiler size was 100 – 300 TDS (tons of dry solids) per day. and black liquor concentration 45 – 55%. Frequently to sustain combustion auxiliary fuel needed to be fired. Primary air was 60 – 70% of total air with secondary the rest. In all levels openings were small and design velocities were 40 – 45m/s. Both air levels were operated at 150oC. Liquor gun or guns were oscillating. Main problems were high carryover, plugging and low reduction. But the function, combustion of black liquor, could be filled.|$|E

25|$|The F-82E had a {{range of}} over , which meant that with {{external}} fuel tanks it could fly from London to Moscow, loiter for 30 minutes over the target, and return, the only American fighter which could do so. It also had an operational ceiling of , where it could {{stay close to the}} bombers it was designed to protect. The first production F-82Es reached the 27th in early 1948, and almost immediately the group was deployed to McChord AFB, Washington, in June, where its squadrons stood on alert on a <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> defense mission due to heightened tensions over the Berlin Airlift. It was also believed that the 27th would launch an escort mission, presumably to the Soviet Union, if conflict broke out in Europe. From McChord, the group flew its Twin Mustangs on weather reconnaissance missions over the northwest Pacific, but problems were encountered with their fuel tanks. Decommissioned F-61 Black Widow external tanks were found at Hamilton AFB, California, which could be modified for the F-82; fitted on the pylons of the Twin Mustang, these solved the problem. With a reduction in tension, the 27th returned to its home base in Nebraska during September, where the unit settled down to transition flying with their aircraft.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Toronto built Malton Airport as a <b>secondary</b> <b>air</b> field, {{but it was}} Malton that became Toronto's main airport. This fact meant that the island airport became used mainly for general civil {{aviation}} and lost money on its operations. During the 1940s and 1950s, several political leaders proposed {{the expansion of the}} airport as a way to enable scheduled passenger airlines and reduce the airport deficits. An expansion of runways and facilities was completed in 1962, financed by the sale of Malton Airport to the Government of Canada. Despite the improvements, the island airport did not become a passenger airline hub, and its existence came into question, starting in the 1960s. In 1968, the site was proposed for a large housing development known as 'Harbor City.' In the 1970s, as part of a debate around airports serving Toronto, the airport became the focus of efforts to set up a network of airports in Canada serving Short-Take-Off-And-Landing (STOL) regional airlines. From a peak of over 200,000 annual flights in the 1960s, the island airport went into decline even as several regional airlines operated at the airport from the 1970s onwards. The annual operating deficit forced its operator, the Toronto Harbour Commission (THC) to sell land to pay the ongoing deficit and by the 1990s, the airport was again facing questions about its continued existence.|$|E

40|$|Cosmic-ray {{secondaries}} and tertiaries {{have been}} studied {{in a series of}} experiments. It has been shown that the secondaries from lead have little power to produce detectable tertiaries or showers from lead or aluminum. The secondaries from aluminum have been found to produce more showers in lead than the <b>secondaries</b> from <b>air.</b> The absorption coefficient of the secondaries from aluminum {{has been found to be}} 0. 7 cm- 1 Pb and the absorption coefficient of their lead tertiaries 2. 0 cm- 1 Pb.

It follows that the <b>air</b> <b>secondaries</b> and their lead tertiaries have greater energies than the aluminum secondaries and their lead tertiaries. It has been found that a component of the cosmic rays even softer than the corpuscular component is probably the chief source of the secondaries producing the showers.
