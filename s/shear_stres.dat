The results of these measurements support two important conclusions about the mechanics of crustal faulting. First, the magnitudes of measured in situ stresses indicate ratios of <b>shear</b> to normal <b>stres.</b> s on favorably oriented fault planes that are consistent with predictions based on Mohr-Coulomb theory and laboratory-determined coefficients of friction in the range of 0. 6 - 1. 0 assuming hydrostatic pore pressure (this is commonly known as Byerlee's law). Thus the stress measurements indicate that the frictional strength of the crust adjacent to the San Andreas fault is high (i. e., consistent with laboratory-derived friction values) and that the level of shear stress in the crust adjacent to the San Andreas is principally controlled by its frictional strength. However, data on the orientation of maximum horizontal compression in the borehole from 1. 75 to 3. 5 km (N 57 øE + 19 ø) indicate that the San Andreas must be quite weak as a complete absence of right-lateral shear stress resolved on planes parallel to the [...] •N 60 øW striking San Andreas fault is observed. The lack of right-lateral shear stress on planes parallel to the San Andreas fault at this site is especially surprising as Cajon Pass is located along a section of the San Andreas which has not had a major earthquake since 1812 and is thus presumably quite "late " in the earthquake cycle. Nevertheless, both the {{orientation and}} magnitudes of stresses measured in the well are consistent with the style of active faulting in the area surrounding the drill site, most notably normal faulting and Quaternary age left-lateral slip on the Cleghorn fault that parallels the San Andreas in the vicinity o...|$|R

This paper develops a new method which can evaluate the boundary shear stress using the main flow data based on Momentum Balance Method (MBM). A theoretical relationship between the boundary shear stress and parameters of main flow region is established. The obtained results from MBM agree well with other methods, indicating that the new method is reasonable and reliable. The significant contribution of MBM is that the local boundary shear stress accurately and quickly can be determined by application of this new method.

Non-ciliated cells that were subjected to fluid shear stress showed significantly less induction of the shear marker Krüppel-Like Factor- 2, as compared to ciliated cells. In addition, ciliated cells from which the cilia were chemically removed show a similar decrease in flow response. This shows that primary cilia sensitize endothelial cells for fluid shear stress.

By using three different D. salina strains and three different stress conditions, we varied the profiles of the carotenoids produced. Between Dunaliella bardawil and D. salina 19 / 18, no remarkable differences were seen in the extraction profiles, although D. salina 19 / 18 seemed to be better extractable. D. salina 19 / 25 was not “milkable” at all. The milking process could only be called selective for secondary carotenoids in case gentle mixing was used.

40|$|Shear {{stress is}} the {{tangential}} {{force of the}} flowing blood on the endothelial surface of the blood vessel. Shear is described mathematically for ideal fluids, and in vitro models have enabled researchers to describe the effects of shear on endothelial cells. High shear stress, as found in laminar flow, promotes endothelial cell survival and quiescence, alignment {{in the direction of}} flow, and secretion of substances that promote vasodilation and anticoagulation. Low shear stress, or changing shear stress direction as found in turbulent flow, promotes endothelial proliferation and apoptosis, shape change, and secretion of substances that promote vasoconstriction, coagulation, and platelet aggregation. The precise pathways by which endothelial cells sense shear stress to promote their quiescent or activated pathways are currently unknown. Clinical applications include increasing shear stress via creation of an arteriovenous fistula or vein cuff to promote bypass graft flow and patency.

However, whether podocytes are sensitive to fluid shear stress is completely unknown. In the present study, we therefore exposed cells of a recently generated conditionally immortalized mouse podocyte cell line to defined fluid shear stress in a flow chamber, mimicking flow of the glomerular ultrafiltrate over the surface of podocytes in Bowman’s space. Shear stress above 0. 25 dyne/cm 2 resulted in dramatic loss of podocytes but not of proximal tubular epithelial cells (LLC-PK 1 cells) after 20 h. At 0. 015 - 0. 25 dyne/cm 2, lamellipodia formation in podocytes was enhanced and the actin nucleation protein cortactin was redistributed to the cell margins. Shear stress further diminished stress fibers and the presence of vinculin in focal adhesions. Linear ZO- 1 distribution at cell-cell contacts remained unaffected at low shear stress.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of wake/leading-edge {{interactions}} were studied at off-design conditions. Measurements were performed on the stator-blade suction surface at midspan. The leading-edge flow-field was investigated using hotwire micro-traverses, hotfilm surface shear-stress sensors and pressure micro-tappings. The trailing-edge flow-field was investigated using hotwire boundary-layer traverses. Unsteady CFD calculations were also performed to aid {{the interpretation of the}} results. At low flow coefficients, the time-averaged momentum thickness of the leading-edge boundary layer was found to rise as the flow coefficient was reduced. The time-resolved momentum-thickness rose due to the interaction of the incoming rotor wake. As the flow coefficient was reduced, the incoming wakes increased in pitch-wise extent, velocity deficit and turbulence intensity. This increased both the time-resolved rise in the momentum thickness and the turbulent spot production within the wake affected boundary-layer. Close to stall, a drop in the leading-edge momentum thickness was observed in-between wake events. This was associated with the formation of a leading-edge separation bubble in-between wake events. The wake interaction with the bubble gave rise to a shedding phenomenon, which produced large length scale disturbances in the surface <b>shear</b> <b>stres...</b>|$|E

Once proteases enter into the circulation during shock, there may be proteolytic damage to the extracellular components of cells including cleavage of surface receptors and the glycocalyx of the endothelial cells (ECs). The endothelial cell is sensitive to physiological shear stress (typically 10 - 15 dyn/cm²) and aligns {{in the direction of the}} fluid flow. Sheared endothelial cells exhibited a higher tolerance to protease exposure than static cells. Extracellular damage to the endothelial cell by active proteases causes the ECs to not align in the direction of the fluid shear stress; however when the proteases were inhibited, ECs exposed to shear stress could realign with the direction of the flow. Receptor intensity of the mechanosensors VEGFR- 2 and junctional PECAM- 1 was reduced on both sheared and unsheared ECs. The insulin receptor surface density was also reduced for cells exposed to proteases. In conclusion, proteases present in the circulation during shock may damage extracellular molecular membrane components on the cell and interfere with one of the most basic mechanotransduction mechanisms in endothelial cells, i. e. aligning in the presence of physiological <b>shear</b> <b>stres...</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective—Arterial-venous {{specification}} in {{the embryo}} has been assumed {{to depend on}} the influence of fluid mechanical forces, but its cellular and molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. Our previous in vitro study revealed that fluid shear stress induces endothelial cell (EC) differentiation by murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. In the present study we investigated whether shear stress regulates the arterial-venous specification of ES-cell-derived ECs. Methods and Results—When murine ES cell–derived VEGFR 2 cells were exposed to shear stress, expression of the arterial EC marker protein ephrinB 2 increased dose-dependently. The ephrinB 2 mRNA levels also increased in response to shear stress, whereas the mRNA levels of the venous EC marker EphB 4 decreased. Notch cleavage and translocation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) into the nucleus occurred as early as 30 minutes after the start of shear stress and increased with time. Gamma-Secretase inhibitors (DAPT and L 685 458) and the recombinant extracellular domain of the Notch ligand DLL 4 abolished the shear stress–induced NICD translocation, and that, in turn, blocked the shear stress–induced upregulation of ephrinB 2 expression. In addition, the VEGF receptor kinase inhibitor SU 1498 was found to suppress both the shear-stress-induced Notch cleavage and up-regulation of ephrinB 2 expression. Conclusion—Exposure to shear stress induces an increase in expression of ephrinB 2 in murine ES cells via VEGF-Notch signaling pathways. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2009; 29 : 2125 - 2131.)

The Reynolds number based on the mean velocity, the pipe diameter and the local viscosity at the wall is approximately 10000.

Our experimental results are compared with results obtained with water and with a very dilute solution which exhibits {{only a small amount}} of drag reduction. We have focused on the observation of turbulence statistics (mean velocities and turbulence intensities) and on the various contributions to the total shear stress. The latter consists of a turbulent, a solvent (viscous) and a polymeric part. The polymers are found to contribute significantly to the total stress. With respect to the mean velocity profile we find a thickening of the buffer layer and an increase in the slope of the logarithmic profile. With respect to the turbulence statistics we find for the streamwise velocity fluctuations an increase of the root mean square at low polymer concentration but a return to values comparable to those for water at higher concentrations.

To reduce such effects, we recently coated a tube connecting the carotid and the distal femoral artery of rats with albumin. When we partially occluded this perfusion line, the reduction of flow {{was followed by a}} marked increase, which seemed not to be caused by autoregulation but by release of a vasodilator at the site of occlusion. In the present study, we investigated whether this vasodilator could originate from platelets aggregating under the influence of increased shear stress at the site of occlusion. Blood distal to the site of occlusion indeed contained numerous platelet aggregates that were not present before occlusion. Continuous recording with a photometric device showed that aggregation in the tube started before flow increased and ended before flow decreased again. Blockade of serotonin S 1 - and S 2 -receptors with methiothepin prevented the flow response. Estimated shear stress (231 +/- 17 dyn/cm 2) and shear rate (6, 370 +/- 478 s- 1) at the site of occlusion were of the magnitude known to elicit platelet aggregation. Others have recently demonstrated that shear-induced platelet aggregation is mediated by binding of von Willebrand factor to platelet glycoprotein Ib, which is inhibited by aurintricarboxylic acid. This drug (35 mg/kg iv) completely abolished both platelet aggregation and flow increase in our experiments.

To address this need, we designed novel in vitro parallel-plate flow chamber models of a straight artery, a bifurcation artery, and a bifurcation aneurysm, characterized by reproduc-ible hemodynamic conditions to study the effect of shear stress on endothelial cell (EC) phenotypes at different microenvi-ronment locations. Importantly, the model is simple, effective, and has high throughput in that it is low cost and only takes 24 to 48 hours to produce results.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate flow environments in which such a control strategy might be effective in removing harmful algae from the water column and depositing a layer of clay/algal flocs on the sea floor. We simulated the natural environment in two laboratory flumes: a straight-channel “ 17 m flume ” in which flocs settled in a still-water column and a “racetrack flume ” in which flocs settled in flow. The 17 m flume experiments were designed to estimate the critical bed shear stress for resuspension of flocs that had settled for different time periods. The racetrack flume experiments were designed to examine the deposition and repeated resuspension of flocs in a system with tidal increases in flow speed. All flume runs were conducted with the non-toxic dinoflagellate Heterocapsa triquetra and phosphatic clay (IMC-P 4). We repeated the experiments with a coagulant, polyaluminum hydroxychloride (PAC), expected to enhance the removal efficiency (RE) of the clay. Our experiments indicated that at low flow speeds (≤ 10 cm s− 1), phosphatic clay was effective at removing algal cells from the water column, even after repeated resuspension. Once a layer of flocs accumulated on the bed, the consolidation, or dewatering, of the layer over time increased the critical shear stress for resuspension (i. e. decreased erodibility).

Here, we experimentally investigate {{the effects of}} debris-flow composition on the amount and spatial patterns of bed scour and erosion downstream of a fixed to erodible bed transition. The experimental debris flows were observed to entrain bed particles both grain by grain and en masse, {{and the majority of}} entrainment was observed to occur during passage of the flow front. The spatial bed scour patterns are highly variable, but large-scale patterns are largely similar over 22. 5 – 35 ° channel slopes for debris flows of similar composition. Scour depth is generally largest slightly downstream of the fixed to erodible bed transition, except for clay-rich debris flows, which cause a relatively uniform scour pattern. The spatial variability in the scour depth decreases with increasing water, gravel (= grain size) and clay fraction. Basal scour depth increases with channel slope, flow velocity, flow depth, discharge and shear stress in our experiments, whereas there is no correlation with grain collisional stress. The strongest correlation is between basal scour and shear stress and discharge. There are substantial differences in the scour caused by different types of debris flows. In general, mean and maximum scour depths become larger with increasing water fraction and grain size, and decrease with increasing clay content. However, the erodibility of coarse-grained experimental debris flows (gravel fraction = 0. 64) is similar {{on a wide range of}} channel slopes, flow depths, flow velocities, discharges and shear stresses. This probably relates to the relatively large influence of grain-collisional stress to the total bed stress in these flows (30 – 50 %).

This is a flow configuration of interest for sediment erosion, {{also referred to as}} scouring. The measurements were made with an acoustic profiler that gives access to the three components of the instantaneous velocities. For the flat-wall flow, it is shown that the outer-layer spatial growth rate and the maxima of the Reynolds stresses approach the values accepted for the far field of a wall jet at a downstream distance x/b 0 ≈ 8. These maxima are only about half the values of a plane free jet. This reduction in Reynolds stresses is also observed in the shear-layer region, x/b 0 11, the maximum Reynolds shear stress approaches the value of a plane free jet. This change in Reynolds stresses is related to the mean vertical velocity that is negative for x/b 0 < 8 and positive further downstream. The evolution of the inner region of the wall jet is found to be in good agreement with a previous model that explicitly includes the roughness length. On the concave wall, the mean flow and the Reynolds stresses are drastically changed by the adverse pressure gradient and especially by the development of Görtler vortices. On the downslope side of the scour hole, the flow is nearly separating with the wall shear stress tending to zero, whereas on the upslope side, the wall-friction coefficient is increased by a factor of about two by Görtler vortices.

40|$|In recent years, the {{independent}} measurement of wall shear stress with oil-film or oil-drop interferometry {{has become a}} cornerstone of turbulent-boundary-layer research as many arguments depend critically on a precise knowledge of the skin friction τ_w^∗. To our knowledge, all practitioners of oil-drop interferometry have so far used the leading-order similarity solution for asymptotically thin, wedge-shaped, two-dimensional oil films established by Tanner & Blows (J. Phys. E: Sci. Instrum., vol. 9, 1976, pp. 194 - 202) to relate the evolution of drop thickness to τ_w^∗. It is generally believed that this procedure, if carefully implemented, yields the true time-averaged τ_w^∗ within ± 1 % or possibly better, but the systematic errors due to the finite thickness of the oil film have never been determined. They are analysed here for oil films with a thickness {{of the order of}} a viscous unit in a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer. Neglecting spanwise surface curvature and surface tension effects, corrections due to the secondary air boundary layer above the oil film are derived with a linearised triple-layer approach that accounts for the turbulent shear-stress perturbation by means of modified van-Driest-type closure models. In addition, the correction due to processing oil drops with a slight streamwise surface curvature as if they were exact wedges is quantified. Both corrections are evaluated for oil-drop interferograms acquired in a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer at a Reynolds number of around 3500, based on displacement thickness, and are shown to produce a reduction of the friction velocity relative to the basic Tanner and Blows theory of between - 0. 1 % and - 1. 5 %, depending on the mixing-length model. Despite the uncertainty about the true correction, the analysis allows the formulation of some guidelines on where and when to analyse interference fringes in order to minimise the error on the measured wall <b>shear</b> <b>stres...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} of the periodontal ligament to alter its structure and mass in response to mechanical loading has long been recognized. However, the mechanism by which periodontal cells can detect physical forces and respond to them is largely unknown. Besides transmission of forces via cell-matrix or cell-cell interactions, the strain-derived flow of interstitial fluid through the periodontal ligament may mechanically activate the periodontal cells, as well as ensure transport of cell signaling molecules, nutrients and waste products. Mechanosensory cells, such as endothelial and bone cells, are reported {{to respond to a}} flow of fluid with stimulated prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and nitric oxide production. Therefore, we examined the PGE 2 and nitric oxide response of human periodontal ligament and gingival fibroblasts to pulsating fluid flow and assessed the expression of tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase activity. Periodontal ligament and gingival fibroblasts were subjected to a pulsating fluid flow (0. 7 +/- 0. 02 Pa, 5 Hz) for 60 min. PGE 2 and nitric oxide concentrations were determined in the conditioned medium after 5, 10, 30 and 60 min of flowing. After fluid flow the cells were cultured for another 60 min without mechanical stress. Periodontal ligament fibroblasts, but not gingival fibroblasts, responded to fluid flow with significantly elevated release of nitric oxide and decreased expression of tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase activity. In both periodontal ligament and gingival fibroblasts, PGE 2 production was significantly increased after 60 min of flowing. Periodontal ligament fibroblasts, but not gingival fibroblasts, produced significantly higher levels of PGE 2 during the postflow culture period. We conclude that human periodontal ligament fibroblasts are more responsive to pulsating fluid flow than gingival fibroblasts. The similarity of the early nitric oxide and PGE 2 responses to fluid flow in periodontal fibroblasts with bone cells and endothelial cells suggests that these three cell types possess a similar sensor system for fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stres...</b>|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{computational}} {{studies were}} performed to elucidate the role of turbulent stresses in mechanical blood damage (hemolysis). A suspension of bovine red blood cells (RBC) was driven through a closed circulating loop by a centrifugal pump. A small capillary tube (inner diameter 1 mm and length 70 mm) was incorporated into the circulating loop via tapered connectors. The suspension of RBCs was diluted with saline to achieve an asymptotic apparent viscosity of 2. 0 � 0. 1 cP at 23 °C to produce turbulent flow at nominal flow rate and pressure. To study laminar flow at the identical wall shear stresses in the same capillary tube, the apparent viscosity of the RBC suspension was increased to 6. 3 � 0. 1 cP (at 23 °C) by addition of Dextran- 40. Using various combinations of driving pressure and Dextran mediated adjustments in dynamic viscosity Reynolds numbers ranging from 300 – 5, 000 were generated, and rates of hemolysis were measured. Pilot studies {{were performed to}} verify that the suspension media did not affect mechanical fragility of the RBCs. The results of these bench studies demonstrated that, at the same wall shear stress in a capillary tube, the level of hemolysis was significantly greater (p < 0. 05) for turbulent flow as compared with laminar flow. This confirmed that turbulent stresses contribute strongly to blood mechanical trauma. Numerical predictions of hemolysis obtained by computational fluid dynamic modeling were in good agreement with these experimental data. ASAIO Journal 2004; 50 : 418 – 423. The identification of mechanisms of shear induced blood trauma is essential for all blood contacting artificial organ design. Numerous investigations {{over the past several}} decades have sought to identify the critical shear stress and exposure time related to the produced hemolysis (complete destruction of a fraction of the RBCs in the samples studied). This research has resulted in an assortment of hemolysis thresholds for a variety of experimental setups. 1 – 10 However, the mechanisms of shear blood damage are varied and are not completely identified.
