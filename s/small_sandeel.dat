40|$|Monthly {{sampling}} for ichthyoplankton {{was conducted}} at three stations very near to the coast (near to shore shallow stations before the surf zone in direction to the shoreline) of Atlantic northwestern Portugal within contrasting localities: rocky shore, {{in front of a}} sandy beach receiving an estuary and a fishing port with heavy anthropogenic impact. Sampling was conducted from August 2002 to October 2003, always at full moon, at low tide and high tide in daylight hours, at the water column using a 48  cm diameter plankton net with 335  [mu]m mesh. Analysis of the physico-chemical parameters pointed out the spatial (horizontal) homogeneity of the sampling area. Fish larvae from 41 taxa belonging to 17 families were identified; Blenniidae, Labridae, Ammodytidae, Clupeidae, Gobiidae, Soleidae and Gobiesocidae were the most representative during the study period. Parablennius gattorugine, Ammodytes tobianus, Symphodus melops, Sardina pilchardus, Lipophrys pholis and Coryphoblennius galerita were the most representative species (percentage contribution to total abundance). Peak abundance of fish eggs occurred during May, June and August 2003 and fish larvae occurred during May and July 2003 and August 2002 and 2003; there was a pronounced winter/early spring (March 2003) peak in larval abundance dominated by the <b>small</b> <b>sandeel</b> A. tobianus. This study identifies the occurrence of a conspicuous assemblage of larval fishes at very nearshore shallow environments of a variety of species with different adult habitats: the fish larvae assemblage was dominated by intertidal species. The present study has shown that temporal and spatial variations in the larval fish assemblage are related to environmental conditions and biological dynamics: the results suggest that abiotic conditions mediate biotic parameters, and that both abiotic and biotic characteristics regulated the larval fishes at very nearshore shallow environments.

40|$|International audienceKnowledge of {{life history}} and {{connectivity}} between essential ecological habitats are relevant for {{conservation and management}} of species and some natural tracers {{could be used to}} study the lifecycles of small or short-lived marine fishes. Although sandeels are central in marine food webs and are key species, there is incomplete knowledge about population mixing and migration patterns. For the first time the use of the otolith microchemistry on sandeel species is evaluated {{in the case of the}} <b>Small</b> <b>Sandeel.</b> Variations in microchemical fingerprints of 13 trace elements are performed with a Femtosecond LA-ICPM from the core to the margin of sagittal otolith and are compared within and between otoliths extracted from 34 fishes sampled in three different sites along the coast of the south-western English Channel in France. Firstly, preliminary investigations on the validity of the method revealed that Mg/Ca was the only ratio significantly dependant on fish ontogeny and sampling season. Secondly, the Mn/Ca, Zn/Ca, and Cu/Ca ratios enabled us to significantly discriminate among sampling sites. Thirdly, microchemical fingerprints of each life stage varied significantly among sampling sites but not within them, suggesting high site fidelity over relatively short distances. Finally, the fingerprints of all life stages were significantly different from those of the larval and metamorphosis stages. The otolith microchemistry could detect change of signature relative to the shift from a pelagic behaviour to a resident bentho-pelagic behaviour during the middle of the juvenile stage in Small Sandeels. Hence, analysis of trace element fingerprints in otoliths appears to be a valuable method to further studies on ontogenic habitat change, population mixing and variation of life history and be helpful for the management at local or regional scales of short-lived species such as those belonging to other Ammodytidae...|$|E
40|$|Capsule: Morphologically similar sympatrically {{breeding}} species {{differ in}} diet and foraging strategies, which could explain interspecific variation in breeding success and reproductive output. Aims: To compare provisioning rate and diet of nestling Arctic (Sterna paradisaea) and Common Terns (Sterna hirundo), and examine how variation in provisioning behaviour influences reproductive parameters. Methods: Arctic and Common Tern nests were observed from June to July 2011 on Coquet Island, northeast England. We compared chick provisioning rate, diet and energy delivery rate between species, and examined whether these parameters {{were associated with}} interspecific differences in chick growth and survival, and total number of chicks fledged. Results: Arctic Terns delivered higher percentages of <b>smaller</b> <b>Sandeels</b> (Ammodytes marinus) and juvenile fish to chicks than did Common Terns, which delivered comparatively high percentages of larger Sprats (Sprattus sprattus). Although chick growth rate and survival {{were not significantly different}} between species, Common Terns fledged more chicks than Arctic Terns due to a tendency for larger clutch sizes. Conclusion: Our study suggests that interspecific differences in diet and foraging strategies can support total reproductive output in morphologically similar species...|$|R
40|$|The {{coverage}} of this master thesis is 58 pages, with 25 Figures and 9 Tables. The Simrad SH 90 high frequency omidirectional sonar was used in a field experiment in 2011 to acoustically investigate the distribution of Lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) during the North Sea sandeel survey by the Norwegian research vessel Johan Hjort". The sonar was applied together with conventional echo sounder survey, with trawl and dredge sample stations at various point. During the survey, sonar screenshots were recorded for 750 school from the total survey period, while two sandeel banks, the Inner Shoal East" and Hardangervidda" was investigated by using post-processing software LSSS for echo sounder data and PROFOS for sonar data. Sandeel school parameters were carefully analyzed from the screenshots by using the image editing software ImageJ". The results show that sandeel schools can well be detected with the Simrad SH 90 omnidirectional sonar in good to fair weather conditions. The effective detection range for weak schools in shallow water is about 250 m. The sonar showed greater capability of detecting sandeel schools during a conventional acoustic survey, with 3. 02 and 1. 44 times the detections of the echo sounder for Inner Shoal East and Hardangervidda respectively. The school area, perimeter, shape and position relative to the vessel, show that sandeel schools are relative large with an average horizontal area of 1225 m 2. However, the sonar system showed detection limitations {{with respect to the}} smaller schools situated near the seabed. A comparisons made between sandeel schools detected with both acoustic systems, show that the relative size of <b>smaller</b> <b>sandeel</b> schools are more often underestimated in areal size compared with the sonar, while the larger schools are overestimated. The sonar survey show examples of potential missing of schools on echo sounder transects, and have therfore the potential for being a good tool in future two stage adaptive surveys...|$|R
40|$|We {{combined}} radiotelemetry techniques with {{an automatic}} nest balance system to obtain detailed, concurrent data on foraging activity, prey consumption and foraging performance in four pairs of Shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis during chick rearing on the Isle of May, Scotland. During the study period {{the location of the}} main feeding area changed abruptly from c. 10 km away from the colony (long-range trips, LRT) with return flight times from the feeding area to the colony of 7 - 14 min to c. 0. 8 km away (short-range trips (SRT), return flight times < 3 min). The two feeding areas differed in water depth (LRT dives shallower) and probably also in the size of prey taken. There were significant differences between trip types in almost every aspect of feeding activity recorded. LRT were characterised by high diving efficiency (the proportion of the dive cycle spent foraging) and low feeding rates (mass of prey caught per second foraging). In contrast, diving efficiency was lower and feeding rates were higher for SRT. The gross intake rate (the product of diving efficiency and feeding rate) was significantly higher in SRT than LRT. We suggest that the observed switch in preferred feeding area was caused by the sudden appearance of large numbers of <b>small</b> lesser <b>sandeels</b> Ammodytes marinus in the waters just off the Isle of May. The higher feeding rates attained by birds on SRT could have been due to higher concentrations of prey and/or reduced foraging costs associated with unsuitable habitat for sandeels in this area. Results from this study suggest that the distribution of available resources influences the choice of foraging areas in Shag...|$|R
40|$|In {{this review}} we {{summarize}} {{what is known}} about mechanisms by which climate change may be affecting the populations of seabirds around the UK. Breeding success and adult survival are the key factors affecting changes in seabird populations, and food intake is implicated as a major determinant of both. The diet of most UK seabird species is almost exclusively <b>sandeels,</b> <b>small</b> clupeoid fish or zooplankton and {{it is clear that the}} marine pelagic food web is the key ecological system determining food supply. Hence, we develop the review by first considering how climate changes may affect primary production, and then examine how this propagates through the food web to zooplankton and fish culminating in fluctuations in seabird numbers. A trend of increasing numbers of many seabird species since 1970, particularly puffins, guillemots and razorbills, appears to have been reversed since 2000. The proximate cause of the recent declines seems to be a succession of 5 years of low breeding success for a range of species due to a shortage of food, especially sandeels. However, the connection with climate change remains uncertain, thoug...|$|R
40|$|Sandeels {{are known}} to be {{negatively}} affected by climate change in a number of ways. This study investigated whether these changes are affecting the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), a species which consumes sandeels. Porpoise diet was examined in spring (March–May), a critical time of year for survival when sandeels are important prey, from 1993 to 2001 to provide baseline information on the proportion of sandeels consumed. When data from spring 2002 and 2003 were compared to these baseline data, the diet was found to be substantially different, with a significant and substantially <b>smaller</b> proportion of <b>sandeels</b> being consumed in March and May. There were also differences in the number of porpoises starving between the two time periods (33 % in spring 2002 and 2003 died of starvation, but only 5 % in the baseline period). This suggests that a lower proportion of sandeels in the diet of porpoises in spring increases the likelihood of starvation. Therefore, we suggest that the negative effects of climate change on sandeel availability may have serious negative effects on harbour porpoise populations in the North Sea by increasing the likelihood of starvation in spring...|$|R
