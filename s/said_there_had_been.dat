5|$|Interested {{parties on}} both sides filed amici. A group of {{conservative}} Republicans {{in both houses of}} Congress, including Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Henry Hyde and Rick Santorum, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both argued for affirming the conviction, pointing to the invaluable nature of undercover investigations in fighting child pornography, worrying that requiring reasonable suspicion beforehand could make such operations impossible. Americans for Effective Law Enforcement <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> no entrapment and that reasonable suspicion was not required before starting investigations such as Looking Glass. The American Civil Liberties Union, its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.|$|E

25|$|In later cases, {{brought in}} the 1950s {{involving}} other organized sports and similar activities, the Court had refused to exempt them and noted, as it did when asked to end baseball's exemption outright in Toolson, Congress's relative inactivity on the issue. Since then, Blackmun <b>said,</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> some bills, but all intended to extend the exemption to other sports and none to repeal it entirely.|$|E

25|$|At the March 2013 hearing, Ellerbe {{also accused}} his department's {{mechanics}} and rank-and-file firefighters of purposefully sabotaging equipment. He cited the D.C. Inspector General's report of February 2013, which <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> allegations of sabotage (including driving vehicles in low gear to damage transmissions, slashing tires, and tampering with air conditioners). The following month, Ellerbe {{claimed he had}} complete confidence in the repair personnel at DCFEMS.|$|E

He {{had been invited}} by Thai student activist Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal to address students at Chulalongkorn University to mark the 40th anniversary of the Thammasat University massacre in 1976. Wong <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> no explanation for his detention. Thai officials admitted pressure from the Chinese government. Protest to the Royal Thai Consulate-General in Hong Kong was observed. 30 Hong Kong Legislative Councillors demanded explanation and apology from the Thai government.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, neighbors saw Frank Jr., age 6, lugging a {{pick and}} shovel out into South Troy Street and start digging. Upon inquiry, Frank <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{a lot of}} {{construction}} on the street the day Elsie disappeared, and he had heard his parents discussing the possibility that she had fallen into a hole. As she struggled to climb out, {{she might have been}} buried under falling sand and gravel. Workers still fixing the street said that it was possible, but they would have noticed immediately. Meanwhile, people in the West End and a woman in Kings, Illinois reported sightings of light-skinned girls traveling with gypsies.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{a long-standing}} {{tradition}} of mead consumption, the beverage is a niche product in Poland. In 2013, about 600,000 litres of mead {{were sold in}} Poland, compared with 142.5 million litres of wine sold during the same period. Mead amounted to 0.5 percent of total alcohol consumption in Poland in 2013. Only nine percent of adult Poles polled that year declared that they had drunk mead {{at least once in}} the last three months; 27 percent said they had enjoyed mead in the last 12 months. Those who drank mead, did so mostly at family or social gatherings. A majority of those who did not, <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> no occasion for it.|$|E
25|$|Statements were {{collected}} from all the crew. These were all written out for presentation to the inquiry on standard forms in identical handwriting with similar phrasing. Quartermaster Johnston later described that pressure had been placed upon him to be loyal to the company, {{and that it had}} been suggested to him it would help the case if two torpedoes had struck the ship, rather than the one which he described. Giving evidence to the tribunal he was not asked about torpedoes. Other witnesses who claimed that only one torpedo had been involved were refused permission to testify. In contrast to his statement at the inquest, Captain Turner stated that two torpedoes had struck the ship, not one. In an interview in 1933, Turner reverted to his original statement that there had been only one torpedo. Most witnesses <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> two, but a couple said three, possibly involving a second submarine. Clem Edwards, representing the seamen's union, attempted to introduce evidence about which watertight compartments had been involved but was prevented from doing so by Lord Mersey.|$|E
500|$|Britain vigorously rallied other NATO {{countries}} {{to take a}} stand against Portugal over Reedman. France warned that NATO pressure was unlikely to yield results in his matter, but Belgium's NATO representative, André de Staercke, agreed to challenge Salazar on 11 September. At his meeting with de Staercke, Salazar denied that Portugal was giving Rhodesia its own diplomatic representation, and <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> some misunderstanding. Portugal would not obstruct Reedman's entry should he arrive, Salazar said, as he was travelling on a (Rhodesian-issued) British passport. On 14 September, Nogueira's ministry released a statement saying that if Britain challenged Portugal over Rhodesia at NATO, Lisbon would [...] "use the greatest firmness to repel any attempt to attribute particular responsibilities or to make criticism of Portugal's position".|$|E

500|$|Holtzman, who was {{trailing}} last in polls, borrowed over $400,000 from Fleet Bank to run {{a negative}} ad accusing Ferraro and Zaccaro of taking more than $300,000 in rent in the 1980s from a pornographer with ties to organized crime. [...] Ferraro <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> efforts to oust the man, Robert DiBernardo, after reports of the tenancy originated during her 1984 vice-presidential campaign, but he had remained in the building for three more years. [...] In addition, a report by an investigator for the New York State Organized Crime Task Force {{found its way to}} the media via a tip from a Holtzman aide; it said that Zaccaro had been seen meeting with the DiBernardo in 1985. [...] Ferraro said in response that those two had never met.|$|E
500|$|In {{a session}} of Prime Minister's Questions some weeks later, David Cameron {{challenged}} Brown to concede on record that [...] "no deals were done" [...] in ensuring {{the bill was}} passed. Brown stood before the House and said, [...] "yes". Cameron quoted from a letter written by Labour's Chief Whip Geoff Hoon to Keith Vazthe Chairman of the Home Affairs Committeein which Hoon expressed deep thanks for Vaz's support and closed the letter with the line, [...] "I trust {{that you will be}} appropriately rewarded". Hoon said that this was just a joke between friends but others, such as Conservative leader David Cameron and Shadow Home Secretary David Davis viewed this letter as proof that deals were indeed done behind the scenes and that Brown lied on the record when he <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> none. The House of Lords defeated the bill, which Lords said was [...] "fatally flawed, ill thought through and unnecessary", stating that [...] "it seeks to further erode...fundamental legal and civil rights".|$|E
500|$|Johnson said {{he found}} SSH logs on the MacBook that showed an SFTP connection, from an IP address that {{resolved}} to Manning's aunt's home, to a Swedish IP address with links to WikiLeaks. Also found was a text file named [...] "Readme", attached to the logs and apparently written by Manning to Assange, which called the Iraq and Afghan War logs [...] "possibly {{one of the most}} significant documents of our time, removing the fog of war and revealing the true nature of 21st century asymmetric warfare". The investigators testified they had also recovered an exchange from May 2010 between Manning and Eric Schmiedl, a Boston mathematician, in which Manning said she was the source of the Baghdad helicopter attack ("Collateral Murder") video. Johnson <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> two attempts to delete material from the MacBook. The operating system had been re-installed in January 2010, and on or around January 31, 2010, an attempt had been made to erase the hard drive by doing a [...] "zero-fill", which involves overwriting material with zeroes. The material was recovered after the overwrite attempts from unallocated space.|$|E

500|$|The World Bank loaned India {{funds for}} development, and Mayawati was to manage {{projects}} with this money in UP. The projects were preplanned and on schedule, but the Mayawati government made changes which put the projects behind schedule, including rapidly transferring high-caste managers {{in and out}} of rural posts. The World Bank sent a letter of complaint on 1 August 2002 to India's central government stating, [...] "We have now learnt that project managers have been replaced within three weeks of assuming office. The project coordinator of the Diversified Agriculture Support Project has been changed twice in quick succession and at the moment there is no project coordinator. In the forestry project, numerous changes have been made over the past six months ... Such developments do not augur well for these time-bound projects that require consistently good leadership." [...] Mayawati initially responded by saying the letter was a fake and later <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a misunderstanding. She then decreased the number of transfers, stopped creating new posts, and temporarily reduced the level of government spending on furniture and vehicles in response to the allegations. The World Bank continued to criticise the level of corruption even after these measures had been implemented.|$|E
500|$|According to a March 18 {{report that}} was leaked to {{television}} journalist Nikki Finke, focus groups responded poorly to {{a screening of}} the rough-cut version of the pilot. Several viewers felt the show was a [...] "carbon copy" [...] of The Office, {{and needed to be}} differentiated from that series to avoid coming across as forced and unoriginal. Some viewers found it predictable, slow-paced and lacking character development, and felt the beginning of the episode needed to better explain the situation and setting. Several viewers said the show lacked quality male characters, particularly a [...] "datable" [...] lead male. Other viewers, however, said The Office needed time to develop into a quality show, and they felt audiences would be more patient with Parks and Recreation than other shows due to its connection to The Office. Viewers also said the show's portrayal of bureaucracy of local government was [...] "very believable" [...] and could provide quirky and silly situations for the show, and they liked Poehler's character and performance. The release of the report led to speculation in the media that Parks and Recreations was not ready for prime-time television. In response to the leaked negative feedback, Ben Silverman said rough cuts of shows are usually received negatively, even for ultimately successful shows. Schur also <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> at least four complete edits to the pilot since the focus-group results came in.|$|E
500|$|Clark began {{planning}} {{work for}} {{responses to the}} war in Bosnia and Herzegovina upon his appointment in 1994 as the Director, Strategic Plans and Policy (J5) on the JCS staff. While collecting information to outline military options for resolving the conflict, Clark met with Bosnian Serb military leaders including Ratko Mladić, who was later accused of war crimes and genocide. Clark was photographed exchanging hats with Mladić, and the photo drew controversy in the United States. A Washington Post story was published claiming Clark had made the visit despite a warning from the U.S. ambassador. Some Clinton administration members privately said the incident was [...] "like cavorting with Hermann Göring." [...] Clark listed the visit in the itinerary he submitted to the ambassador, but he learned only afterwards that it was not approved. He <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> no warning and no one had told him to cancel the visit, although two Congressmen called for his dismissal regardless. Clark later said he regretted the exchange, and the issue was ultimately resolved as President Clinton sent a letter defending Clark to the Congress and the controversy subsided. Clark said it was his [...] "first experience in the rough and tumble of high visibility... and a painful few days." [...] Conservative pundit Robert Novak later referred to the hat exchange in a column during Clark's 2004 presidential campaign, citing it as a [...] "problem" [...] with Clark as a candidate.|$|E
