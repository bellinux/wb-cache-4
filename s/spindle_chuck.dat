50|$|A {{router table}} is a {{stationary}} woodworking machine in which a vertically oriented spindle of a woodworking router protrudes from the machine table and can be spun at speeds typically between 3000 and 24,000 rpm. Cutter heads (router bits) may be mounted in the <b>spindle</b> <b>chuck.</b> As the workpiece is fed into the machine, the cutters mold a profile into it. The machine normally features a vertical fence, against which the workpiece is guided to control the horizontal depth of cut. Router tables are used to increase the versatility of a hand-held router, as each method of use is particularly suited to specific application, e.g. very large workpieces would be too large to support on a router table and must be routed with a hand-held machine, very small workpieces would not support a hand-held router and must be routed on a router table {{with the aid of}} pushtool accessories etc.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} machines, devices and {{production}} lines that {{are equipped with}} rotating elements (shafts, axes, spindles, trailing and drive wheels, etc.). Correct geometry of these elements ensures trouble-free operation, and, {{in the case of}} machine tools it decides about the correct geometric parameters of the manufactured semi-finished articles and pro-ducts. In this respect, the newly manufactured and operated lathes are checked against the cor-rect geometry of their parts which determine the location of the work-piece and the lathe and their movement These parts are geometrically correct if the errors of their geometrical shape (deviations) do not exceed values designated in the standards. The wearing of lathes reveals the so-called spindle run-out (deviation from circularity). These deviations are determined using mainly the workshop methods. However, due to the considerable sizes of machine tools surveying methods and new methods which use elec-tronic and optoelectronic devices also apply. Authors of this work present the measuring set (which they designed and built themselves) which relies on the two-point fibre signalling device which is installed in the lathe <b>spindle</b> <b>chuck</b> jaws. The position of the signalling device during the lathe spindle rotation is recorded with CCD/CMOS digital camera, and the images are stored on the camera memory card. The aim of the presented research and experimental works was to determine the internal conformity of measurement results that were obtained using the designed and constructed measuring set, to check whether there is a correlation between the results obtained using the dial indicator and to analyse the accuracy of observations that were made using the test set. The designed measuring set enables to determine deviations from circularity during the lathe spindle rotation with the accuracy of ± 0. 02 mm.

50|$|The {{front part}} of the brace {{consists}} of a <b>chuck</b> <b>spindle</b> with V-shaped brackets or clamps inside. Turning the <b>spindle</b> of the <b>chuck</b> in a clockwise direction tightens the drill bit in the chuck and turning in a counter-clockwise direction loosens the bit for removal.|$|R
50|$|Commercial CNC {{metalworking}} machines use {{closed loop}} feedback controls for axis movement. In a closed loop system, the control {{is aware of the}} actual position of the axis at all times. With proper control programming, this will reduce the possibility of a crash, but it is still up to the operator and programmer to ensure that the machine is operated in a safe manner. However, during the 2000s and 2010s, the software for machining simulation has been maturing rapidly, and it is no longer uncommon for the entire machine tool envelope (including all axes, <b>spindles,</b> <b>chucks,</b> turrets, tool holders, tailstocks, fixtures, clamps, and stock) to be modeled accurately with 3D solid models, which allows the simulation software to predict fairly accurately whether a cycle will involve a crash. Although such simulation is not new, its accuracy and market penetration are changing considerably because of computing advancements.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAvailable motor <b>spindles</b> and tool <b>chucks</b> {{generate}} uncontrolled process deviations {{at several}} eigenfrequencies leading to geometrical and surface distortions. A demand for highest precision motor <b>spindles,</b> tool <b>chucks</b> and cutting tools arises for advanced cutting processes, free from tool deflection and vibrations. This paper targets a new {{design of a}} non-typical Adaptive Spindle System (AS) with an additional electromagnetic bearing based on mechatronics and adaptive control methods for advanced cutting technologies and proposals drafting on AIS development. The static and dynamic performance determination of the AS at speeds of up to 15, 000 rpm has been performed on a test bench with actuator stimulated forces and displacement sensors. The analysis of time-domain and amplitude-frequency characteristics confirmed the demand in adaptive closed-loop control methods for compensating tool deflections and vibrations at eigenfrequencies...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{machining}} operation require ultra-high-precision motor <b>spindles,</b> tool <b>chucks</b> and cutting tools, free from tool deflection and vibrations. Available motor <b>spindles</b> and tool <b>chucks</b> generate uncontrolled process deviations at several eigenfrequencies, leading to geometrical and surface distortions. This paper presents a patented design method of a non-typical Adaptive Spindle System {{with an additional}} electromagnetic bearing based on mechatronics and adaptive control methods for advanced cutting technologies. In comparison to known active magnetic bearing systems for rotor orientation, a rotor damping is investigated between roller bearings. The static and dynamic performance determination of the AIS motor spindle {{have been carried out}} at a speed of up to 15, 000 rpm on a test bench with actuator stimulated forces and displacement sensors. The analysis of time-domain and amplitude-frequency characteristics confirmed the demand in adaptive closed-loop control methods compensating tool deflections and vibrations at eigenfrequencies...|$|R
50|$|Specialised lathes for {{machining}} long workpieces such as {{segments of}} drill strings. Oil country lathes {{are equipped with}} large-bore hollow <b>spindles,</b> a second <b>chuck</b> {{on the opposite side}} of the headstock, and frequently outboard steadies for supporting long workpieces.|$|R
40|$|Sine-bar {{attachment}} for collets, <b>spindles,</b> and <b>chucks</b> helps machinists set {{up quickly}} for precise angular cuts that require greater precision than provided by graduations of machine tools. Machinist uses attachment to index head, carriage of milling machine or lathe relative to table or turning axis of tool. Attachment accurate to 1 minute or arc depending on length of sine bar and precision of gauge blocks in setup. Attachment installs {{quickly and easily}} on almost any type of lathe or mill. Requires no special clamps or fixtures, and eliminates many trial-and-error measurements. More stable than improvised setups and not jarred out of position readily...|$|R
50|$|A {{drill press}} (also {{known as a}} {{pedestal}} drill, pillar drill, or bench drill) is a fixed style of drill that may be mounted on a stand or bolted to the floor or workbench. Portable models with a magnetic base grip the steel workpieces they drill. A drill press consists of a base, column (or pillar), table, spindle (or quill), and drill head, usually driven by an induction motor. The head has a set of handles (usually 3) radiating from a central hub that, when turned, move the <b>spindle</b> and <b>chuck</b> vertically, parallel to the axis of the column. The drill press is typically {{measured in terms of}} swing. Swing is defined as twice the throat distance, which is the distance {{from the center of the}} spindle to the closest edge of the pillar. For example, a 16 in drill press has an 8 in throat distance.|$|R
5000|$|Work on the {{standardization}} of T-slots started in 1924 and a tentative standard {{was published in}} 1927. The first official American Standard for T-slots came in 1941. [...] B5 Technical Committee No. 11 was organized in New York on December 4, 1928, and B5 Technical Committee No. 4 on Spindle Noses was organized on December 5, 1928. These two committees worked in close cooperation {{with each other and}} with manufacturers and users of engine lathes, turret lathes and automatic lathes in developing standards for <b>spindle</b> noses and <b>chucks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Boring : Enlarging or {{smoothing}} {{an existing}} hole created by drilling, moulding etc.i.e. the machining of internal cylindrical forms (generating) a) by mounting workpiece to the <b>spindle</b> via a <b>chuck</b> or faceplate b) by mounting workpiece onto the cross slide and placing cutting tool into the chuck. This work {{is suitable for}} castings that are too awkward to mount in the face plate. On long bed lathes large workpiece can be bolted to a fixture {{on the bed and}} a shaft passed between two lugs on the workpiece and these lugs can be bored out to size. A limited application but one that is available to the skilled turner/machinist.|$|R
50|$|Glass-working lathes {{are similar}} in design to other lathes, but differ {{markedly}} in how the workpiece is modified. Glass-working lathes slowly rotate a hollow glass vessel over a fixed- or variable-temperature flame. The source of the flame may be either hand-held or mounted to a banjo/cross-slide that can be moved along the lathe bed. The flame serves to soften the glass being worked, so that the glass in a specific area of the workpiece becomes ductile and subject to forming either by inflation ("glassblowing") or by deformation with a heat-resistant tool. Such lathes usually have two head-stocks with chucks holding the work, arranged so that they both rotate together in unison. Air can be introduced through the headstock <b>chuck</b> <b>spindle</b> for glassblowing. The tools to deform the glass and tubes to blow (inflate) the glass are usually handheld.|$|R
