5|$|The {{first case}} against Acton, before Mr. Baron Carter, {{was for the}} murder in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a {{carpenter}} and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left with <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> eat that {{he had tried to}} escape by throwing a rope over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, stamped on his stomach, placed him in the hole (a damp space under the stairs), then in the strong room.|$|E
25|$|The two-year {{war between}} the ABA and the USBA was perhaps the ugliest rivalry that BMX has ever saw. It seems the USBA was making most of the {{aggressive}} moves. The motivation for rivalries like this was the $2 million to $4 million in revenue yearly that BMX generated at the time. Compared to other older more established sports like baseball, European football (soccer), American football and auto racing, this was a pittance but still enough to generate bad promoters and political infighting between and within sanctioning bodies. Track operators had quite thin profit margins to work with, which perhaps made the back biting even worse since there was <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> go around. There was a slump in the BMX racing market as mentioned {{with the growth of}} Freestyle, the resurgence of skateboarding siphoning off young people and the insurance crises to drain resources further. Pretty desperate times for the organizers of BMX racing, and desperate times generate desperate acts, including actions straight out of Watergate.|$|E
25|$|Climate {{change was}} {{referred}} to in several of Giddens’s books from the mid-1990s onwards, but was not discussed at length until {{the publication of his}} work The Politics of Climate Change in 2009. Climate change, Giddens says, constitutes a fundamental threat to the future of industrial civilisation as it spreads across the globe. Given that is the case, he asks, why are countries around the world doing <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> counter its advance? Many reasons are involved, but the prime one is the historical novelty of humanly induced climate change itself. No previous civilisation intervened into nature on a level remotely similar to that which we do on an everyday level today. We have no previous experience of dealing with such an issue and especially one of such global scope, or of the dangers it poses. Those dangers hence appear as abstract, and located at some indefinite point in the future. ‘Giddens’s paradox’ consists of the following theorem. We are likely put off responding adequately to climate change until major catastrophes unequivocally connected to it occur; but by then by definition it will be too late. For {{we have no way of}} reversing the build-up of greenhouses gases that is driving the transformation of the world’s climate. Some such gases will be in the atmosphere for centuries.|$|E

Peters sang [...] "Broadway Baby", [...] "The Ladies Who Lunch", [...] "Isn't He Something?", [...] "I Remember" [...] and [...] "With <b>So</b> <b>Little</b> <b>to</b> Be Sure Of", among others. Jesse Green, in his review in New York Magazines Vulture site, commented: [...] "hat a wrenching (and funny) actress Peters remains, not {{on top of her}} voice but through it."

500|$|The Never Ending Tour {{commenced}} on June 7, 1988, and Dylan {{has played}} roughly 100 dates {{a year for}} the entirety of the 1990s and 2000s—a heavier schedule than most performers who started out in the 1960s. By May 2013, Dylan and his band had played more than 2,500 shows, anchored by long-time bassist Tony Garnier, drummer George Recile, multi-instrumentalist Donnie Herron, and guitarist Charlie Sexton. To the dismay of some of his audience, Dylan's performances remain unpredictable as he alters his arrangements and changes his vocal approach night after night. Critical opinion about Dylan's shows remains divided. Critics such as Richard Williams and Andy Gill have argued that Dylan has found a successful way to present his rich legacy of material. Others have criticized his live performances for mangling and spitting out [...] "the greatest lyrics ever written so that they are effectively unrecognisable", and giving <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> the audience that [...] "it is difficult to understand what he is doing on stage at all." ...|$|E

Pitchfork Media writer Mark Richardson {{said that}} [...] "on first listen {{it sounds like}} a demo of a pre-Loveless track, possibly from the You Made Me Realise era" [...] and while there was [...] "no exploration on that front … the melody and voice are familiar and welcome." [...] Writing for Stylus Magazine, Andrew Unterberger called [...] "City Girl" [...] "a worthy opener" [...] and added that [...] " [...] where Kevin's at right now—making pretty pop songs. There is <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> this song that it's almost enough to make you think Kevin's lost his mind." [...] Unterberger summarised the song as [...] "gorgeous, and definitely has that sighing quality to it that makes the film so delectable." [...] Exclaim! journalist Michael White noted that it was [...] "the indisputable highlight of the soundtrack" [...] and AllMusics Heather Phares described [...] "City Girl" [...] as an [...] "open-ended piece" [...] and [...] "naïve [...] guitar-driven" [...] but added that it did not compare to Shields' compositions on Loveless (1991).|$|E

500|$|Robert Hilburn {{from the}} Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "Madonna {{represents}} a contemporary fantasy figure that revives the glamour, innocence and raw sexuality {{of many of}} Madonna's own teen heroes, including Marilyn Monroe and James Dean. Like the early Monroe, Madonna may portray a bimbo, but there she's clearly no pushover. Though the audience was on its feet throughout, it often seemed that Madonna was operating beneath her potential in this pop format. It's important to demonstrate that she can handle herself live, but the simplicity of pop concerts doesn't begin to tax her ambition or talent. In fact, she has <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> do other than express this aggressive, sexy attitude that the show seemed long at just over an hour. Heidi Sherman from Spin commented, [...] "The Virgin Tour was Madonna's first, yet it {{put her in the}} same league as Prince and Bruce Springsteen. It proved that Madonna was beyond real. And if her stage presence indicated she was more showgirl than musician, at least she knew how to gussy up her act for the postfeminist MTV age. Boy Toy? Not exactly. She was a bonafide pop star in the process of becoming a cultural icon." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} Rampart Dam was being considered, Alaska as a whole, and Interior Alaska in particular, was sparsely settled. The 1960 United States Census {{recorded}} just 226,127 people as residents of Alaska, {{making it the}} least-populated state in the United States at that time. Interior Alaska contained about 28,000 residents, and promoters suggested that the dam's benefits would vastly outweigh the costs to the few residents who would be displaced. An unnamed Gruening staffer once said the area to be flooded by the dam was worthless, containing [...] "not more than ten flush toilets. Search the whole world {{and it would be}} difficult to find an equivalent area with <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> be lost through flooding." [...] In a 1963 letter responding to a Sports Illustrated article about the dam, Gruening wrote, As for the 2,000 Athabascan Indians, they could not but be better off than they are now. Their villages are flooded intermittently by the Yukon. Their habitations are miserable and their livelihood a bare subsistence supplemented by relief. Construction of the Rampart Dam will give them ample gainful employment, and in their new locations, chosen by them on the lake's borders, they will have better homes, better community facilities and a permanent income from now nonexistent activities, generated by the lake.|$|E
500|$|The character's main love {{interest}} throughout his duration on {{the soap opera}} was Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), whom he married in 2011. Nichols had previously stated {{in an interview that}} he thought Tucker would [...] "definitely 'team up' when he finds the right woman". Davidson stated in an interview that the pair will [...] "have their ups and downs, but they're definitely in each other's lives." [...] In September 2011, it is revealed that Tucker is the biological father of Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), the result of a long-ago affair with Harmony Hamilton (Debbi Morgan). When asked of Tucker's reaction to the news, Morgan stated: [...] "It's revealed that Devon was the result of a one-night stand between Harmony and Tucker. That night meant the world to her—Tucker was the love of her life—but it meant <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> him that he doesn't even recognize Harmony when they meet again. Not a clue! It's like a dagger through her heart." [...] James said he was [...] "overjoyed" [...] at the revelation, stating: [...] "There's so much they can do with this story. The relationship between Tucker and Devon—my character allowing that relationship to grow. How it affects Neil. And there's a plethora of possibilities that can come from his relationship with Mrs. Chancellor. I'm sure that relationship will develop just as it will with Devon and Tucker. And then, there's Devon's mother, Harmony, who is back." [...] Tucker and Ashley's marriage ended the following year, after he cheated on her with Harmony. Following their divorce, Nichols stated in an interview with Xfinity that Tucker would [...] "have to find a new woman" [...] as he [...] "can't be without female companionship".|$|E

2500|$|The {{southern}} {{portion of}} SK Hwy 35 from the Canada–United States border to Weyburn forms the initial {{segment of the}} CanAm Highway. [...] The terrain is mixed prairie featuring rolling moraines and valleys. [...] North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA super corridors are a concept of huge transportation corridors connecting Mexico, United States, and Canada. [...] The CanAm highway was a concept begun in the 1920s. This area has been subject to criticism as the entry way to Canada of this route.

'Truckers from my constituency tell me that the U.S. Customs officials say {{they are not going to}} put up with the mud that is coming across on the trucks. There is also concerns about grain seeds and weeds coming across in the mud on truck tires.'...Highway Minister Maynard Sonntag said. 'Highway No. 6 has a much higher traffic count, many more trucks in and out from the States than Highway No. 35 would have.’' [...] " [...] "The projects on Highways 39 and 6 will help to improve traffic flow through these Canada/U.S. ports. 'Highways 6 and 39 are very important to Saskatchewan – serving as tourism links and major north-south trade corridors to the U.S.,' Sonntag said. [...] "Highway 35 from Wadena South is always an adventure. I have found my driving skills have improved immensely especially when it comes to emergency braking and swerving to avoid the many areas of broken pavement. This past spring the Dept. of Highways could have saved thousands in signage costs if they only had put up warning signs where the road was smooth and unbroken."
