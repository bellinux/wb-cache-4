Tokyo-based architecture professor Julian Worrall has said Shibuya Crossing is [...] "a great example of what Tokyo does best when it's not trying." ...|$|R
40|$|Various model {{geometries}} and {{combinations of}} perforated flap surfaces and <b>screens</b> <b>mounted</b> {{close to the}} flap surfaces were studied for application to jet-flap noise attenuation for externally blown flap, under-the-wing aircraft. The efforts to reduce jet-flap interaction noise were marginally successful. Maximum attenuations of less than 4 db in overall sound pressure level were obtained in the flyover plane. Noise reductions obtained in the low-to-middle-frequency ranges (up to 7 db) were generally offset by large increases in high-frequency noise (up to 20 db) ...|$|R
50|$|The Pivo {{is powered}} by a {{lithium-ion}} battery. The car's futuristic design incorporates large doors for easy access to the cabin and large windscreens and windows for high visibility. As well as the fully rotational cabin, the Pivo features Nissan's Around View Monitor system. This reduces blind spots (areas of the road which cannot be seen from the driver's position) by displaying the outside surroundings on <b>screens</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the inside of the}} car's A-pillars, located on either side of the windshield.|$|R

30|$|The {{subjects}} {{were instructed to}} keep target speed of 2  km/h during the experiments. For providing visual feedback to the subject, the wheelchair speed was displayed on a computer <b>screen</b> <b>mounted</b> {{in front of the}} user. The disturbance torque was applied to the rear wheels. For these experiments, the disturbance torque was set to simulate road inclinations of 0 °, 2 ° and 4 °. The wheelchair seat was set horizontal. For the lever propulsion tests we used three gear ratios: 1.5, 1, and 1 / 1.5.|$|R
50|$|The pair's {{next project}} was {{a celebration of}} the Lincoln Center's 20th anniversary, {{involving}} five giant movie <b>screens</b> <b>mounted</b> on the facade of the Metropolitan Opera House, playing a history of the center. After this they were invited to create a retrospective play of the history of rock'n'roll music. Entitled Rock 'N Roll! The First 5,000 Years, it previewed at the St. James Theatre on October 5, 1982, officially opening on October 24, before closing on October 31 after just nine shows, to terrible reviews.|$|R
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of DBS television. Using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology as a reference, these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite {{no matter where}} or how the vehicle (on which the antenna is mounted) is situated. These mobile satellite antennas are popular with some recreational vehicle owners. Such mobile DBS antennas are also used by JetBlue Airways for DirecTV (supplied by LiveTV, a subsidiary of JetBlue), which passengers can view on-board on LCD <b>screens</b> <b>mounted</b> in the seats.|$|R
