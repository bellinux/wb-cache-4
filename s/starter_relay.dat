50|$|An alcohol {{interlock}} {{consists of two}} main components: the breath alcohol measuring instrument with the measuring system and a mouthpiece located {{in the interior of}} the vehicle, and the control unit normally installed under the dashboard and unblocking, resp. blocking the current supply to the <b>starter</b> <b>relay</b> of the vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|Ford {{issued a}} nonstandard starter, a {{direct-drive}} [...] "movable pole shoe" [...] design that provided cost reduction rather than electrical or mechanical benefits. This type of starter eliminated the solenoid, {{replacing it with}} a movable pole shoe and a separate <b>starter</b> <b>relay.</b> This starter operates as follows: The driver turns the key, activating the starter switch. A small electric current flows through the solenoid actuated <b>starter</b> <b>relay,</b> closing the contacts and sending large battery current to the starter motor. One of the pole shoes, hinged at the front, linked to the starter drive, and spring-loaded away from its normal operating position, is swung into position by the magnetic field created by electricity flowing through its field coil. This moves the starter drive forward to engage the flywheel ring gear, and simultaneously closes a pair of contacts supplying current {{to the rest of the}} starter motor winding. Once the engine starts and the driver releases the starter switch, a spring retracts the pole shoe, which pulls the starter drive out of engagement with the ring gear.|$|E
50|$|No one {{had looked}} under the Jeep's hood, so they pried {{it open and}} found that a wire to the <b>starter</b> <b>relay</b> had been cut. This would have allowed the car to {{accelerate}} without anyone depressing the gas pedal, confirming early suspicions {{that no one had}} been in the car when it left the road and thus had been purposely wrecked. They found a fingerprint under the hood and some male DNA on an article of Leah's clothing.|$|E
50|$|Early KB Centuras also {{experienced}} quality issues with interior fixtures, with door trims cracking, and torn vinyl trim near stitching lines not uncommon. A story going around {{is that no}} Centura models were fitted with <b>starter</b> motor <b>relays,</b> which simply put the load onto the ignition switch when cranking instead, which reduced the ignition switch life in some cars.The <b>starter</b> motor <b>relay</b> {{is attached to the}} firewall above the starter motor in all models. Traction in wet weather proved to be poor, with an open differential, relatively large six-cylinder Hemi engine and very light weight over the rear wheels.|$|R
5000|$|IPC events use one {{of three}} {{available}} start formats: individual timed starts, pursuit with multiple <b>starters,</b> and <b>relay</b> with successive competitors. Relay races may have competitors {{with a combination of}} disabilities, each of whom is assigned a handicap according to a [...] "Nordic Percentage System." [...] The percentage is applied to each skierâ€™s final time and the skier with the lowest calculated time is the winner.|$|R
50|$|When an {{electric}} current is {{passed through the}} coil it generates a magnetic field that activates the armature, and the consequent movement of the movable contact(s) either makes or breaks (depending upon construction) a connection with a fixed contact. If the set of contacts was closed when the relay was de-energized, then the movement opens the contacts and breaks the connection, and vice versa if the contacts were open. When the current to the coil is switched off, the armature is returned by a force, approximately half {{as strong as the}} magnetic force, to its relaxed position. Usually this force is provided by a spring, but gravity is also used commonly in industrial motor <b>starters.</b> Most <b>relays</b> are manufactured to operate quickly. In a low-voltage application this reduces noise; in a high voltage or current application it reduces arcing.|$|R
5000|$|A {{starter solenoid}} (or <b>starter</b> <b>relay)</b> {{is the part}} of an {{automobile}} which switches a large electric current to the starter motor, in response to a small control current, and which in turn sets the engine in motion. Its function is thus identical to that of a transistor, but using an electromagnetic solenoid rather than semiconductor to perform the switching. In many vehicles the solenoid also engages the starter pinion with the ring gear of the engine.|$|E
50|$|Relays {{are used}} {{wherever}} {{it is necessary to}} control a high power or high voltage circuit with a low power circuit, especially when galvanic isolation is desirable. The first application of relays was in long telegraph lines, where the weak signal received at an intermediate station could control a contact, regenerating the signal for further transmission. High-voltage or high-current devices can be controlled with small, low voltage wiring and pilots switches. Operators can be isolated from the high voltage circuit. Low power devices such as microprocessors can drive relays to control electrical loads beyond their direct drive capability. In an automobile, a <b>starter</b> <b>relay</b> allows the high current of the cranking motor to be controlled with small wiring and contacts in the ignition key.|$|E
40|$|Mechanical relays {{are more}} and more being {{replaced}} with semiconductor technology. In this thesis it is investigated if and how the larger loads could be controlled by transistors. The main part of this work aims to create and verify a solution that can control the starter motor, as well as protect it in case of any failure. The different malfunctions that the solution protects against is high current, too high peak current, low current, maximum crank time and minimum cool off time. The timers also protect indirectly against overheating of the starter engine. The transistors used are BTS 555, from Infineon. Typical rated current of the transistor is 158 A and it has integrated functions such as temperature protection, short circuit protection and current sensing. The functions was tested and evaluated. The temperature protection and current sensor was found to satisfy the specification. The short circuit protection did not protect against all kinds of short circuit failures thus an external over current protection has been added. To control the starter motor, twelve transistors were connected in parallel, to allow for a total of initial start current 2 000 A and a continuous maximum current of 1 150 A. A series of tests were performed on the transistors, the external protections and the starter motor, until everything worked together as planned. The control circuits is designed with simple gate logic in combination with other active and passive components. The transistors are the largest expense. The used solution has an estimated price of 400 SEK, assembling excluded. The assembling is estimated to take one hour. Conclusions made from measurements and tests shows {{that it is possible to}} control the starter motor by using semiconductor technology. Since the solenoid in the current <b>starter</b> <b>relay</b> will not be excluded, the solution might be hard to motivate in an economic aspect. The advantages with a semiconductor solution are the protective functions and that the starter motor will be disconnected from the batteries when not being used. To control the smaller loads, such as the preheater, the semi conductor relay is a competitive alternative since the mechanical relay and the fuse can be replaced...|$|E
