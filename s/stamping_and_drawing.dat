40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a stamping die {{design of a}} kind of textile machine needle. According to the size, material and mass production requirements of needle, the blanking technological property of parts are analyzed, and its general principles, methods and steps of die design are introduced. The structure of stamping die is gap-frame press, and JB 23 - 25 is selected to do the work. The dimensions of cutting edge and dimensional tolerance are calculated. Finally designing components, checking <b>stamping</b> equipment <b>and</b> <b>drawing</b> assembly diagram are finished. This stamping die is mainly composed by punch die and concave die, positioning parts, discharge unit, die set, <b>stamping</b> machine <b>and</b> fasteners...|$|R

40|$|As the peircing north {{wind blew}} his icy gusts around the corners and swept {{the streets with}} his broomlike blasts, the people <b>stamped</b> their feet <b>and</b> <b>drew</b> their coats more closely about them. It seemed as though Wind and Sun were having a terrific {{argument}} and Wind was doing his utmost to win this battle. The crowd was beginning to lose {{a little of the}} feverish excitement that a military parade always seems to cause. Suddenly the strains of the national hymn were carried to their ears; and, forgetting the cold, the crowd cheered and sang as the band marched into sight. What a day for a parade! What a day for fighting; it seemed almost a Russian day...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the growing}} ranges of {{applications}} for stamped parts in the electrical and electronics industry (e. g. switch cabinet cladding and transformer plates) {{as well as in}} the automotive industry (e. g. <b>stamp,</b> bent <b>and</b> <b>drawn</b> components), flexible sheet metal forming has become a more important process. The inner and outer contours as well as the forming operations needed to reinforce metal sheets can be carried out by punching machines without re-clamping the metal sheet. In contrast, the potential of conventional punching machines is now exhausted in terms of the material spectrum that can be processed, the tool life and the quality of the machined product. Particularly in view of the machining quality of the sheared edges, the achievable clear-cut surface rates are limited due to the limited plasticity of the sheet materials. When cracks form between the grain boundaries of the sheet material during the conventional shearing process, the cutting edge is divided into a c lear-cut surface zone (approx. 30 % of the plate thickness when shearing stainless steel plates: 1. 4301) and a shearing zone with crack formation. This shearing zone can not be used as a functional surface. The shearing process is divided into the four phases (DIN 8588) "warping", "clear-cutting", "fracture" and "ejection of the piece punched out"...|$|R
40|$|AA- 6061 {{aluminium}} alloys are used extensively in automobile and aerospace industries owing to their excellent combination of mechanical and physical properties. This alloy exhibits prominent anisotropy in mechanical properties when produced as cold rolled sheets. In manufacturing, sheet metal anisotropy may have severe consequences for downstream {{processes such as}} <b>stamping</b> <b>and</b> deep <b>drawing</b> operations. In the present study, correlations among in-plane anisotropy, strain path and formability of AA- 6061 sheet metal are investigated. Using limit dome height tests, forming limit diagrams (FLDs) were constructed for three different sheet directions by applying appropriate strain localization and fracture criteria. For each sheet direction and strain path, microstructure and texture evolution were also observed to identify the origin of in-plane anisotropy and formability of the AA- 6061 sheet metal alloy. A detailed analysis of microstructure under different strain paths suggests the direction and texture dependent yield locus {{to be a significant}} factor for in-plane anisotropy. Infra granular crack propagation in a particular sheet direction (transverse direction: TD) may lead to reduced formability of AA- 6061. Formability, on the other hand, appears to be highly correlated to the relative fraction of specific texture components. Certain critical texture components such as Cube { 001 } and Brass { 011 } influence the forming behaviour of AA- 6061 aluminium alloy significantly...|$|R

40|$|The given {{publication}} {{is devoted}} research of one sign on a medieval amphora from Chersonesos (Byzantine Cherson). The {{mark in the}} form of a cross on a rectangular base is put on a neck of an import vessel of the last third of the X-XI centuries found in a cistern excavation in dwelling house of the IX-XI centuries in Cherson. Among medieval graffiti from Cherson the exact analogy of this image is unknown. There are some examples of drawing of a similar symbol on transport vessels of the Byzantine time from the Eastern Crimea and Sarkel. Crosses of different kinds have received a wide spreading as building marks on a tile during a medieval time. The cross on a base, so called the cross on the Golgotha, is known among the graffiti on the churches of ancient Kiev. The theme of the cross on an eminence is traced in symbolical images of Christian temples; such drawings were found in the church of Cyril in Kiev and on Early Bulgarian strengthened settlement Tzar Asen. The cross on a base is a traditional image on coins and the seals of Byzantine Cherson. In researches of the studying of medieval graffiti there is no common opinion about appointment of this symbol: a sign on the owner of a thing, a workshop sign, customs marks, capacity of container and the description of the goods. Possibly, in this case it is necessary to consider studying experience amphorae <b>stamps</b> <b>and</b> to <b>draw</b> parallels from images on coins to signs on ceramics. Early such communications have already been established at studying of labels-abbreviations and monograms on building ceramics and coins of Chersonesos in the IX-XI centuries...|$|R
