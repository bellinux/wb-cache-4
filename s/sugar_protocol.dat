40|$|Carbohydrates are {{important}} constituents of several biological systems, including DNA, and elucidating their radiation chemistry is therefore of general importance. In particular, sugar radicals {{play a crucial}} role in radiation-induced single and double strand breaks in DNA, which can lead to mutations and, finally, cancer. Certain sugars such as sucrose (table sugar) are also promising dosimetric materials. An advanced knowledge of the radiation-induced processes in carbohydrates may therefore provide better insight into the DNA radiation chemistry and aid in establishing reliable <b>sugar</b> dosimetry <b>protocols.</b> The first step in acquiring such knowledge is identification of the radical structures. Electron Magnetic Resonance (EMR) experiments on irradiated sugar single crystals allow a very detailed characterisation of the radicals via the g-tensor and the hyperfine interactions between the unpaired electron spin and the nuclear spins in the lattice. Single crystals also offer the advantage of mimicking to some extent the compact structure of chromosomal DNA. Numerous EMR studies on single crystals of sugars and sugar derivatives have been performed the last decades, but radical identification by EMR experiments alone is often ambiguous and sometimes not feasible. The last few years, highly accurate Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on extended organic solid state systems have become possible. These provide a powerful tool to help clarify and interpret experimental results and enable unambiguous structural identifications that were not possible before. In this talk, an overview will be given of recently identified radiation-induced radicals in single crystals of sugars (e. g. sucrose, 1, 2, 3 fructose 4) and sugar derivatives (e. g. glucose 1 -phosphate 5, 6). The results pertain to primary as well as intermediate and stable species and the identifications are mainly based on the agreement, both in principal values and directions, between experimentally determined and DFT calculated proton hyperfine tensors. Common structural features are highlighted and possible commonly operative formation mechanisms are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{stereoselective}} {{formation of}} 1, 2 -cis- 2 -amino glycosides remains a challenging obstacle for researchers seeking to study glycan function in nature. A variety of techniques to form α-linked C(2) -aminoglycosides are examined herein. The most prominent {{of these techniques}} is the nickel catalyzed stereoselective coupling of C(2) -N-benzylidine protected trichloroacetimidates to form 1, 2 -cis- 2 -amino <b>sugars.</b> This <b>protocol</b> demonstrates excellent α-selectivity and is applicable to a large structural variety of C(2) -aminoglycosyl donors and acceptors. The application of the nickel catalyzed stereoselective coupling of C(2) -N-benzylidine protected trichloroacetimidates toward the synthesis of pseudosaccharides of glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchors and mycothiol (MSH) in good yield and with excellent α-selectivity was also examined. In stark contrast, employing conventional Lewis acids to activate trichloroacetimidate donors provided the desired pseudodisaccharides with poor α-selectivity. Additionally, the facile synthesis of both C(1) - and C(6) -hydroxyl myo-inositols bearing differentiated protecting groups from a common and easily attainable intermediate allows access {{to a wide variety}} of GPI anchor and MSH pseudosaccharides. The highly α-selective and scalable synthesis of the Fmoc-protected GalNAc-threonine amino acid and TN antigen in large quantities is also described. The challenging 1, 2 -cis- 2 -amino glycosidic bond is addressed through a coupling of threonine residues with C(2) -N-ortho-(trifluoromethyl) benzylidenamino trihaloacetimidates mediated by Ni(4 -F-PhCN) 4 (OTf) 2. The desired 1, 2 -cis- 2 -amino glycoside was obtained in large quantities with α-only selectivity and subsequently transformed into the Fmoc-protected GalNAc-threonine and TN antigen. With the establishment of 1, 2 -cis-selective synthesis of heparan disaccharides, we sought to develop multivalent inhibitors of heparanase. A model study of protein/glycan interactions, in which various macromolecular architectures were examined, was developed using Concanavalin A as the model protein. Preparations of the highly-ordered monoantennary, homofunctional diantennary, and heterofunctional diantennary glycopolymers of α-mannose and beta-glucose were achieved via ring opening metathesis polymerization. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements of these synthetic glycopolymers with Concanavalin A, which has been reported to bind strongly to α-mannose unit, revealed that heterofunctional diantennary architectures bearing both α-mannose and non-binding beta-glucose residues, glucose units, enhanced binding affinity...|$|R

The objective {{of the study was}} to measure the amount of undiagnosed hypertension and selected cardiovascular risk factors present among the adult population through opportunistic screening at the PHC. Methods: A facility-based opportunistic screening program was carried out in a PHC in rural Puducherry. Patients and accompanying persons aged 30 years and above, who attended the daily outpatient department (OPD) were included. The OPD provides outpatient services and medical procedures or tests without requirement of an overnight stay, and functions for 4 h a day. Known hypertensive patients and pregnant women were excluded. Information on age, gender, diabetes status, and personal history of tobacco and alcohol use were collected using an interview schedule. Height, weight and waist circumference were measured, along with blood pressure and blood <b>sugar</b> using standard <b>protocols.</b> Systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg was taken as hypertension. SBP of 120 - 139 mm Hg and/or DBP of 80 - 89 mm Hg were taken as prehypertension. Results: A total of 324 participants were screened; 56. 8 % were females.

We base ourselves on data collected as part of an exploratory study in the sugar and fresh vegetable supply chains in Mauritius. The reform of the <b>sugar</b> <b>protocol</b> between the European Union and the ACP countries has given rise to two major consequences in the Mauritian agricultural sector. Firstly it has caused an institutional change in the sugar supply chain resulting in large sugar producers diversifying into other more remunerative economic sectors. We refer to research by North to analyse the indirect effects of the reform of the <b>sugar</b> <b>protocol</b> on another supply chain, the fresh vegetables supply chain. The second consequence refers to a second institutional change caused by the entry of large sugar cane producers on the fresh vegetable market. We refer to the theory on collective strategy to analyse whether it is an appropriate strategy for traditional vegetable producers to be more competitive. We conclude by saying that this exploratory study has allowed us to better understand the effects of the reform of the <b>sugar</b> <b>protocol</b> on the fresh vegetables supply chain. Incentives from public policies, entry of large sugar cane producers on the market, emergence of institutional entrepreneurs both among traditional actors of the supply chain and new entrants can lead to a deinstitutionalisation of the vegetable supply chain and eventually giving rise to new institutions with new rules of the game. fresh vegetables supply chain, institutional change, collective strategy, Mauritius, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Labor and Human Capital,...|$|E

Central to this integration was the production of sugar under the West Indian <b>Sugar</b> <b>Protocol,</b> with this ultimately turning Mauritius from a free port into a plantation economy. This shaped the island's economic and political practice, and brought the formation of a range of institutions that sustained a high degree of inequality among Mauritians by finding ever newer ways of conciliating socio-economic mobility with exploitation.
