5000|$|The {{first and}} second rounds were competed at City Park, {{partially}} with a brand new Xtreme croquet set, procured by Daryl Wile. Long, hammerhead mallets with a 45° wedge on one <b>side,</b> <b>axe</b> handles, and rugged metal wickets, the set ensures no course is too extreme. In the interest of time, the extreme round was tamed somewhat, compared to years past. Both rounds were met with excellent play, but little drama.|$|E
50|$|Block hooks: with a {{straight}} or slightly convex cutting edge, they were often used in urban environments for cutting against a wooden block (similar to the back edge of a broom hook, used for trimming {{the head of a}} birch besom to length). Often found with a small hook {{at the back of the}} blade - useful for pulling the wood towards the user. Dutch hooks commonly have {{a straight}} blade and are shown in Renaissance paintings of carpenter's shops, where they would most probably have been used for rough shaping of timber, similar to the <b>side</b> <b>axe.</b>|$|E
50|$|The axe is {{an example}} of a simple machine, as it is a type of wedge, or dual {{inclined}} plane. This reduces the effort needed by the wood chopper. It splits the wood into two parts by the pressure concentration at the blade. The handle of the axe also acts as a lever allowing the user to increase the force at the cutting edge—not using the full length of the handle is known as choking the axe. For fine chopping using a <b>side</b> <b>axe</b> this sometimes is a positive effect, but for felling with a double bitted axe it reduces efficiency.|$|E

Thyateira coins usually display the figures of Apollo and Artemis {{on one side and}} a double <b>sided</b> <b>axe</b> on the other.

50|$|A broadaxe is a large-(broad) headed axe. There are two {{categories}} of cutting edge on broadaxes, both are used for shaping logs by hewing. On one type, one side is flat {{and the other side}} beveled, a basilled edge, also called a <b>side</b> <b>axe,</b> single bevel, or chisle-edged axe. On the other type, both sides are beveled, sometimes called a double bevel axe, which produces a scalloped cut.On the basilled broadaxe the handle may curve away from the flat side to allow an optimal stance by the hewer in relation to the hewn surface. The flat blade is to make the flat surface but can only be worked from one direction and are right-handed or left-handed. The double bevel axe has a straight handle can be swung with either side against the wood. A double beveled broad axe can be used for chopping or notching and hewing. When used for hewing, a notch is chopped {{in the side of the}} log down to a marked line, called scoring. The pieces of wood between these notches are removed with an axe called joggling and then the remaining wood is chopped away to the line.|$|E
50|$|Analysis {{of timber}} samples from Viking long boats {{shows that a}} variety of timbers were used, but there was strong {{preference}} for oak, a tree associated with Thor in Viking mythology. Oak is a heavy, durable timber that can be easily worked by adze and axe when green (wet/unseasoned). Generally large and prestigious ships were made from oak. Other timber used were ash, elm, pine, spruce and larch. Spruce is light and seems to have been more common in later designs for internal hull battens (stringers). Although it is used for spars in modern times there is as yet no evidence the Vikings used spruce for masts. All timber was used unseasoned. The bark was removed by a bark spade. This consisted of a 1.2 m wooden handle with a T crossbar at the upper end, fitted with a broad chisel-like cutting edge of iron. The cutting edge was 60 mm wide and 80 mm long with a 120 mm neck where the handle was inserted. It appears that in cold winters wood work stopped and partly completed timber work was buried in mud to prevent it drying out. Timber was worked with iron adzes and axes. Most of the smoothing was done with a <b>side</b> <b>axe.</b> Other tools used in woodwork were hammers, wedges, drawknives, planes and saws. Iron saws were probably very rare. The Domesday Book in England (1086 AD) records only 13 saws. Possibly these were pit saws and it is uncertain if they were used in longship construction.|$|E

The main garden element, which had been purchased on one of Deering and Chalfin's trips before the villa was laid out, was the fountain from the main piazza of Bassano di Sutri, near Viterbo, which Deering and Chalfin were convinced was by Vignola. Rather than displaying it in the central axis, Suarez sited {{it at the end}} of its own cross-axis, not to be discovered until the visitor had penetrated deep into the plan. The design was richly patterned on the ground, with parterres en broderie in the French baroque taste, contrasts of sun and shade, and many slight changes of level to enliven the essentially flat site.|$|R

40|$|The {{high demand}} of wood as a raw {{material}} {{can be expected}} to soon lead to a severe shortage, resulting in drastic competition between various mills. This competition will be worsened by a restriction of forest cuttings in Quebec. One of the solutions to this problem would be to develop a mixed panel in which the strands of core layer are substituted by outer bark particles, and in this particular case, by particles of white birch. This type of panel could be used as siding panels and for the fabrication of boxes, bins, and commercial shelving. The objective of the present research work concerns the design, the manufacture, and the evaluation of mechanical and physical properties of this type of panel. Two manufacturing factors were taken into account: the strands orientation in the face layers and the alkali treatment made on the bark particles used in the core layer. All produced mixed panels met and exceeded almost all CAN 3 - 0437 R- 1 and O- 1 property requirements. The alkali treatment of bark particles did not improve the mechanical properties of manufactured panels. The statistical analysis method that was used made it possible to choose the panel with non-oriented wood strands in the surface layers and alkali treated bark particles in the core layer as the best by taking into account only the bending strengths in both major and <b>side</b> <b>axes</b> of a panel...|$|R

40|$|Bckground and Objective: There are {{a number}} of {{radioactive}} sources for brachytherapy in various shapes and sizes. Ru- 106 (Ruthenium, 106) ophthalmic plaque have been used for many years in treatment of uveal melanoma. The plaques consist of a thin film of 106 Ru, a  emitter encapsulated in pure silver. The principle purpose of the present work was to evaluate dose distribution along central axis and two sides axis of eyes plaques. Calibration of eye plaques was performed with use of Monte Carlo code (MCNP 4 C) and experimental measurement. Material and Methods: The absolute dose was measured at centre and two sides axis of the Ru- 106 eye applicators a (PMMA) spherical phantom with a radius of 12 mm and height of 28 mm was constructed. To verify experimental measurements, simulation with applicators, TLD and eye phantom was utilized using MCNP 4 C code a P 41. 8 GHZ personal computer. The run time of MCNP 4 C for each eye plaque was 4200 min and the * f 8 tally and cut off of energy was used. Results: Simulated and practical dose distribution of six different types of eye plaques CCA, CCB, CGD, CCY, COB and CIA in the eye phantom were studied. The absolute and relative depth dose along the symmetry axis and two <b>sides</b> <b>axes</b> of the applicators were also evaluated from the surface to about 9 mm distance with less statistical uncertainty than that proposed by NIST and Bebig. The results are fully well comparable to producers proposed data as shown in the curves and graphs. Conclusions: Precision Monte Carlo comparison of the dose distributions applicators listed and absolute dose distribution of practical method show that these plaques were useful to treat uveal melanoma using Monte Carlo method in radiotherapy.

50|$|The Cat and Fiddle Inn is {{the second-highest}} inn or public house in England (the Tan Hill Inn being the highest).
