The photo shows five of the ten large "Dorrco" drum screens (the half cylindrical objects in the background) that were housed in the North Screening Plant. Four men, three in work clothes and one in a suit stand at center. The belt-driven machines the men are standing next to are the screening de-watering elevators that take the screenings off of the drums and drop them into a <b>screening</b> <b>pit</b> for disposal. Arched doors stand slung open on the left wall. Sunlight brightens the room from those open doors...|$|E

40|$|A recent {{assessment}} (Giovannelli, G., D'Urzo, L., Maggiulli, G., Natali, S., Pagliara, C., Sgura, I. & Bozzini, B. 2010. Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry, 14 : 479 – 94.) of the corrosion {{state of}} a late Bronze Age artefact (ca. 1100 BCE) exposed to a coastal environment, based on optical and scanning electron microscopies, X-ray fluorescence mapping, and X-ray diffractometry, led to recognition of bronze disease conditions essentially related {{to the presence of}} nantokite locked inside mesoscopic subsurface pits. The object was then treated successfully with a novel electrochemical approach specifically designed to allow penetration of the electric field into deep, <b>screened</b> <b>pits.</b> In order to further develop and optimize this promising approach by fine-tuning the capabilities of electrochemical control, more insight is required on the specific morphochemistry of the corrosion product scenario. To this end, here we report a space-dependent compositional and chemical-state analysis, performed with synchrotron-based scanning photoelectron microspectroscopy. The investigated object consists of a segregated cast bronze. The prevailing corrosion form is preferential attack of Sn-rich phases, accompanied by a synergistic type of Sn and Cu attack triggered by the peculiar type of decuprification taking place in a bronze disease framework and characterized by the formation of Sn(OH) Cl as a result of local HCl generation in the Cu corrosion process...|$|R
50|$|While the {{proscenium}} arch {{became an important}} feature of the traditional European theatre, often becoming very large and elaborate, the original proscaenium front below the stage became plainer. The introduction of an orchestra pit for musicians further devalued the proscaenium, bringing {{the lowest level of}} the audiences view forward {{to the front of the}} pit, where a barrier, typically in wood, <b>screened</b> the <b>pit.</b> What the Romans would have called the proscaenium is, in modern theatres with orchestra pits, normally painted black in order that it does not draw attention.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} many collieries on the Lancashire Coalfield, women, known as Pit brow lasses were {{employed}} {{on the surface}} to sort coal on the <b>screens</b> at the <b>pit</b> head.

50|$|The Mines Act of 1842 {{prohibited}} {{the employment of}} women and girls and boys {{under the age of}} ten from working underground in coal mines. Many women were employed underground in Lancashire and particularly around Wigan, and after the passing of the Act some continued for a time, as there were few inspectors of mines and employers turned a blind eye. After 1842 many women continued to work at the pits but on the surface, sorting coal from dirt on the coal <b>screens,</b> as <b>pit</b> brow lasses. More women were employed in this capacity in Lancashire than on any other coalfield.|$|R
50|$|Pit brow {{women or}} pit brow lasses were female surface labourers at British collieries. They {{worked at the}} coal <b>screens</b> on the <b>pit</b> bank (or brow) at the shaft top until the 1960s. Their job was to pick stones from the coal after it was hauled to the surface.

40|$|Guidelines advise lifelong {{radiological}} followup for asymptomatic pituitary adenomas (PITs) {{because of}} the risk for growth and subsequent visual field defects. In the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) an even more comprehensive screening is advised because PITs are presumed to manifest more aggressive behavior. We studied the long-term course of MEN 1 -related PITs, which may be used as a model for sporadically occurring PITs. The aim of our study is to assess the results of systematic pre-symptomatic <b>PIT</b> <b>screening</b> and subsequent long-term followup of PITs with emphasis on nonfunctioning microadenomas diagnosed by screening. A cohort study was performed using the Dutch national MEN 1 database, including greater than 90 % of the Dutch MEN 1 population older than 16 years (n = 323). Screening results, natural course, and effects of treatment of PIT were assessed. PIT was diagnosed in 123 patients with MEN 1 (38. 1 %), of whom 66 were diagnosed by MEN 1 -related screening.

5000|$|Longbowmen {{were used}} to great effect on the {{continent}} of Europe, as assorted kings and leaders clashed with their enemies on the battlefields of France. The most famous of these battles were Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt. The English tactical system relied {{on a combination of}} longbowmen and heavy infantry, such as dismounted men-at-arms. Difficult to deploy in a thrusting mobile offensive, the longbow was best used in a defensive configuration. Against mounted enemies the bowmen took up a defensive position, and unleashed clouds of arrows into the ranks of knights and men-at-arms. The ranks of the bowmen were extended in thin lines and protected and <b>screened</b> by <b>pits</b> (e.g. Crecy), stakes (e.g. Agincourt) or trenches (e.g. Morlaix). There is some academic controversy about how the longbowmen and heavy infantry related on the battlefield. According to the traditional view articulated by A.H. Burne, the bowmen were deployed in a [...] "V" [...] between divisions of infantry, enabling them to trap and enfilade their foes. Other, more recent, historians such as Matthew Bennett dispute this, holding that the archers were normally deployed on the flanks of the army as a whole, rather than between divisions.|$|R
40|$|In April and May, 1994, {{researchers}} with the Jeffrey L. Brown Institute of Archaeology, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, conducted a Phase I archaeological survey of a 40. 2 acre {{tract of land}} on Moccasin Bend, Chattanooga, Hamilton County, Tennessee. Owned by the State of Tennessee and being {{a portion of the}} Moccasin Bend State Mental Health Center, the study parcel was the proposed site of an outdoor drama amphitheater facility to be built and operated by Hamilton County. At the time of the survey, the study parcel was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a portion of the Moccasin Bend National Register District created in 1985 to protect significant prehistoric and Civil War period archaeological sites on Moccasin Bend. Of particular importance was the inclusion in the study parcel of bivouac areas associated with a complex of Civil War gun emplacements and campsites known as Fort Whitaker, constructed by Federal troops in the fall of 1863 prior to the Battle of Lookout Mountain. While listed on the National Register, and within the boundaries of the Moccasin Bend National Historic Landmark District, the project area had not been examined by systematic surface reconnaissance in combination with sub-surface testing. Three recorded archaeological sites - 40 HA 134, 40 HA 394 and 40 HA 395 - were wholly or partially subsumed in the study area. Field techniques employed in the project included pedestrian survey and surface collection, structured backhoe trench excavation, metal detector scanning, systematic screened power auger coring, systematic screened 50 cm-square test <b>pit</b> excavation, opportunistic <b>screened</b> lm-square test <b>pit</b> excavation, and other hand-excavated test excavations. In the deeply-alluviated soils of the floodplain portion of the project area, systematic auger testing and trenching by backhoe revealed scattered evidence of Native American settlement. Fire-cracked rock probably deposited in the Late Archaic period, and pottery, daub fragments, and worked flint tools associated with Woodland and/or Mississippian period occupations were recovered. While the fire-cracked rock is probably the result of accumulation of camp fires along the river over several thousand years, the pottery, flint and daub suggest the presence of sedentary occupations, that is, housesites or small villages. Isolated aboriginal artifacts are also present in the Stringers Ridge portion of the project area and in the open meadow off Moccasin Bend Road. No human remains were encountered during the testing. A systematic excavation of 50 cm square, hand-excavated and <b>screened</b> test <b>pits</b> over the open meadow near the highway and extending into the ravine areas of the Stringers Ridge known as 2 ̆ 2 Lilly Spring Hollow 2 ̆ 2 [within 40 HA 395] revealed a scatter of 19 th and 20 th century materials. While the latter artifacts are clearly associated with a housesite in Lilly Spring Hollow occupied into the 1960 s, there is also domestic debris from a mid- 19 th century housesite that appears on a Federal military map. Military artifacts associated with the Federal occupation of Moccasin Bend are present in small quantities despite three decades of relic collecting on the site. Nearly one hundred surface features were recorded on the main tract of the project area, the bulk of these being small excavations for tents pitched on the slopes of Stringers Ridge within and around 2 ̆ 2 Lilly Spring Hollow. 2 ̆ 2 These tent pads represent the bivouac sites of gun crews and support infantry units camped on Moccasin Bend in October and November, 1863. In addition to tent pads, other features, including abandoned roadbeds, were also mapped. Limited excavation on some of the features associate them with the Civil War, although no intensive sub-surface testing has been conducted at this time. Additional secondary testing is required in the project area to determine the extent and condition of the aboriginal remains on the floodplain; to isolate the mid- 19 th century domestic component in 2 ̆ 2 Lilly Spring Hollow; 2 ̆ 2 and to clarify the extent of Civil War bivouac areas associated with Fort Whitaker.

40|$|From the studio’s perspective, {{the mobile}} {{logistics}} of media production are a logical calculation of creative costs. Consideration {{is given to}} the nature of the script and the types of locations it requires but no less important are the range of subsidies and local infrastructure, both physical and human, on offer from a number of production hubs vying for Hollywood’s attention. A competitive exchange rate doesn’t hurt, either. Such factors partially explain how Hollywood has transformed its mode of production into a global machine that assembles projects across an established but arguably interchangeable list of locales. While these top-down calculations may benefit the producer’s bottom line, they often obfuscate the quotidian dimensions that factor into the spatial reconfiguration of film and television production. Drawing on more than two dozen interviews with film and television workers in Los Angeles, Atlanta, London, Prague, Budapest, and the Gold Coast (Australia), this presentation, in line with the larger remit of the panel, reinscribes the role human labor plays in sustaining the global scale of contemporary film and television production. In particular, it argues for the need to attend to the increasingly complex and precarious logistical labor performed by local hires on high-end international productions as a necessary mid-level complement to the macro-level accounts found in political economy, policy studies, and urban planning. In doing so, it ultimately reveals the surprising ‘fragility’ that characterizes the spatially dispersed operations of the studio’s mode of production, and how the responsibility to keep the ‘global machine’ running smoothly disproportionally falls on the workers most vulnerable to the structural shifts and whims of global capital. By way of conclusion, I offer a conceptual provocation for further discussion among the panelists and attendees about the ways in which we frame the agency of these locations and the workers embedded there: how might the concept of ‘ecology’ help us push back against the tendency to <b>pit</b> <b>screen</b> media workers in Southern California (who are losing jobs) against workers in other locations (who are ‘stealing’ them), arguments about “runaway production” that simply serve the interests of the studios, to instead frame the complex articulations of geography and labor as having the ability to negotiate, contest, and contradict the agendas that structure the systems within which they operate...|$|R
