Hematopoietic cells derived from mouse fetal livers were expanded by two successive cultures {{without the use}} of exogenous cytokines, namely, 3 D cultures of stromal cells (DAS 104 - 8 cell line) to form <b>stromal</b> <b>layers</b> within the scaffolds, and, subsequently, by cocultures of the HCs on the <b>stromal</b> cell <b>layers</b> for 2 weeks. To expand the HCs more conveniently, in some experiments the <b>stromal</b> <b>layers</b> formed within the scaffolds were frozen (3 D freezing) before the cocultures, then stored and applied to the cocultures after thawing. When the HCs were cocultured on the <b>stromal</b> <b>layers</b> of the DAS 104 - 8 cells, primitive HCs (c-kit+ and CD 34 + cells) were expanded several fold during the cocultures. In contrast, the expansion of these primitive HCs was remarkably enhanced in the cocultures using the 3 D frozen-thawed DAS 104 - 8 <b>stromal</b> <b>layers</b> (c-kit+ cells > fifteenfold and CD 34 + cells > thirtyfold), and these expansions were significantly higher than those without the 3 D freezing. The expansions enhanced by cocultures on the 3 D frozen-thawed <b>stromal</b> <b>layers</b> were also observed in the cocultures with another stromal cell line (DAS 104 - 4). Because 3 D frozen-thawed stromal cell lines are easy to handle, 3 D coculture of HCs on frozen-thawed stromal cell lines may be an effective and convenient method for expanding primitive HCs...|$|R

40|$|Pure {{interleukin}} 1 (IL 1) {{was found}} to stimulate established human bone marrow <b>stromal</b> <b>layers</b> in long-term culture to produce colony-stimulating activity (CSA). Maximal concentrations in the culture medium were reached 24 hours after a single IL 1 pulse. The effect could be neutralized by a specific rabbit anti-IL 1 antiserum. <b>Stromal</b> <b>layers,</b> once stimulated by IL 1, continued to release CSA into the culture medium {{in the absence of}} exogenous IL 1. A second IL 1 pulse induced CSA release in an identical manner, as did the primary stimulation, indicating that the CSA released was actively produced. Using specific immunologic assays, both granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and macrophage CSF (M-CSF) could be identified in the culture supernatants, and production of both factors was inducible by IL 1. Shortly after initiation of the long-term marrow cultures "spontaneous" G-CSF and M-CSF release occurred. The release of G-CSF diminished following addition of the anti-IL 1 antiserum, indicating that endogenous production of IL 1 by stromal cells had contributed to this effect.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{not known}} whether {{impaired}} hematopoiesis noted during human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection results from infection of stem/progenitor cells or of cells of the bone marrow microenvironment. Normal adherent primary <b>stromal</b> <b>layers</b> were exposed to HIV to determine which of this mixture of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages are susceptible to the virus. Viral p 24 in supernatants was noted with monocytotropic HIV- 1 Ada, HIV- 1 Ba-L, and HIV- 1 JR-FL but not with lymphotropic HIV- 1 LAI nor HIV- 1 MN strain, and only stromal macrophages expressed the viral antigens. Coculture of the layers with PHA-activated normal lymphocytes failed to rescue lymphotropic virus. No p 24 was produced when macrophagedepleted stromal cells were exposed to either HIV- 1 Ba-L or HIV- 1 LAI; proviral DNA was then amplified by PCR in cells exposed to either virus, though coculture with lymphocytes rescued only HIV-IBa-L.

All subjects were underwent CCT measurements using ultrasound pachymetry. Keratocyte densities of each <b>stromal</b> <b>layer</b> were determined by in vivo confocal microscopy. Student′s t-test and Chi-square test were used for statistical evaluations. Correlations between keratocyte densities and CCT were analyzed using Pearson′s correlation analysis. Results: Keratocyte densities in each <b>stromal</b> <b>layer</b> were significantly lower in glaucoma patients receiving PG analogues as compared to those of controls (P < 0. 001).

To test this hypothesis and to assay the effect of the protein on a growing tissue with high vascular density, CDT 6 was expressed in a mouse xenograft model.

40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that conservation and differentiation of primitive human hematopoietic progenitors in in vitro long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC) occurs {{to a greater}} extent when hematopoietic cells are grown separated from the <b>stromal</b> <b>layer</b> than when grown in direct contact with the stroma. This finding suggests that hematopoiesis may depend mainly on soluble factors produced by the stroma. To define these soluble factors, we examine here whether a combination of defined early-acting cytokines can replace soluble stroma-derived biologic activities that induce conservation and differentiation of primitive progenitors. Normal human Lineage-/CD 34 +/HLA-DR- cells (DR-) were cultured either {{in the absence of a}} <b>stromal</b> <b>layer</b> ("stroma-free") or in a culture system in which DR- cells were separated from the <b>stromal</b> <b>layer</b> by a microporous membrane ("stroma-noncontact"). Both culture systems were supplemented three times per week with or without cytokines. These studies show that culture of DR- cells for 5 weeks in a "stroma-free" culture supplemented with a combination of four early acting cytokines (Interleukin- 3 [IL- 3], stem cell factor [SCF], leukemia-inhibitory factor [LIF], and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) results in a similar cell expansion as when DR- cells are cultured in "stroma-noncontact" cultures supplemented with the same cytokines. However, generation of committed progenitors and conservation of the more primitive long-term bone marrow culture initiating cells (LTBMC-IC) was far superior in "stroma-noncontact" cultures supplemented with or without IL- 3 than in "stroma-free" cultures supplemented with IL- 3 alone or a combination of IL- 3, LIF, G-CSF, and SCF. These studies indicate that human BM stroma produces soluble factors that can either alone or in synergy with defined cytokines (1) conserve primitive LTBMC-IC, (2) induce early differentiation of a fraction of the primitive progenitors, and (3) prevent their terminal differentiation. We show here that these stroma-derived factors are not likely to be the known early acting cytokines IL- 3, SCF, LIF, or G-CSF. Characterization of the stroma-derived factor(s) may have important implications for clinically relevant studies, such as in vitro stem cell expansion in cancer treatment and gene therapy. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} bilateral corneal alterations through confocal microscopy in {{a patient}} affected by Cowden syndrome (CS). Methods: Evaluation of Schirmer's, fluorescein, and lissamine green dye tests. Confocal microscopy was performed in both eyes to investigate corneal abnormalities. Results: Slit lamp observation showed the focal involvement of anterior <b>stromal</b> and epithelial <b>layers.</b> Schirmer's, fluorescein, and lissamine green dye test results were regular, while corneal confocal examination confirmed the disorganization of anterior <b>stromal</b> and epithelial <b>layers</b> in both eyes. Conclusion: CS is a rare autosomal-dominant systemic disorder. In our case, confocal analysis revealed predominance of alterations in the anterior <b>stromal</b> corneal <b>layer,</b> showing an increase of reflectivity, and a totally unstructured architecture in the epithelium layer. Even though the main purpose remains the prevention and the early diagnosis of different systemic tumors that could occur in affected patients, corneal confocal evaluation could {{play an important role}} in the early diagnosis of this rare disease...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To examine {{epithelial}} and <b>stromal</b> <b>layers</b> by three-dimensional very high-frequency (VHF) digital {{ultrasound scanning}} {{before and after}} implantation of Intacs (intracorneal ring segments [ICRS]). METHODS: Three-dimensional scanning was performed in five eyes before and 3 months after Intacs insertion. Digital signal processing techniques provided high-resolution B-scan imaging and I-scan traces for high-precision (1 -m) threedimensional pachymetry. Thickness maps of individual corneal layers were constructed of the epithelium, stroma, and full cornea before and after surgery. Difference maps for epithelium and stroma were produced to examine anatomical changes in the thickness profile induced in each layer and correlate these to refractive changes. RESULTS: B-scan examination revealed stromal and epithelial anatomy anterior and adjacent to the Intac. Ring depth could be measured topographically. There was stromal lamellar displacement by the ring segments that [...] ...|$|R
