5|$|The station {{provided}} two permanent crew quarters, the Kayutkas, phonebox-sized booths set {{towards the}} rear of the core module, each featuring a tethered <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag,</b> a fold-out desk, a porthole, and storage for personal effects. Visiting crews had no allocated sleep module, instead attaching a <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag</b> to an available space on a wall; US astronauts installed themselves within Spektr until a collision with a Progress spacecraft caused the depressurisation of that module. It was important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts could wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads.|$|E

5000|$|... "EN 13537:2002 Requirements for Sleeping Bags" [...] is the {{official}} European criterion for the classification of <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags.</b> EN13537 applies to all <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> with the exemption of <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> for military use and <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> for extreme temperatures, i.e., comfort range below -25°C.

5|$|As well as food, camping equipment, and dog-care gear, mushers {{must carry}} an axe, a cold-weather <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag,</b> {{a pair of}} snowshoes, {{veterinary}} records, Quest promotional material, a cooker, and eight booties per dog. Included in the required promotional material are numerous event covers intended to reflect the Quest's ancestry as a mail route. One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately butcher any game animal killed during the race. This rule was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it to protect himself.|$|E
5|$|Strong winds {{prevented}} Mawson {{from continuing}} for two days. Instead, he prepared for travelling alone, removing the rearmost half from the sledge, and rearranging its cargo. To save having to carry excess kerosene for the stove, he boiled {{the remainder of}} the dog meat. Dragging Mertz's body in the <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag</b> from the tent, Mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it, and used two spare beams from the sledge to form a cross, which he placed on the top. The following day he read the burial service.|$|E

40|$|For {{testing the}} thermal {{insulation}} of <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags,</b> standard test {{methods and procedures}} using heated manikins are provided in ASTM F 1720 - 06 and EN 13537 : 2002. However, {{with regard to the}} evaporative resistance of <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags,</b> no instrument or test method has so far been established to give a direct measurement. In this paper, we report on a novel supine sweating fabric manikin system for directly measuring the evaporative resistance of <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags.</b> Eleven <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> were tested using the manikin under the isothermal condition, namely, both the mean skin temperature of the manikin and that of the environment were controlled to be the same at 35 °C, with the wind speed and ambient relative humidity at 0. 3 m s- 1 and 50 %, respectively. The results showed that the novel supine sweating fabric manikin is reproducible and accurate in directly measuring the evaporative resistance of <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags,</b> and the measured evaporative resistance can be combined with thermal insulation to calculate the moisture permeability index of <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags.</b> Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

50|$|A dry bag {{is a type}} of {{flexible}} container which seals in a watertight manner. Dry bags are often used in kayaking, canoeing, rafting, and other outdoor activities where sensitive items would otherwise get wet as well as extreme sports such as skiing and snowboarding. Dry bags are used to protect electronics from water. As well, they are used to prevent <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> and spare clothing from getting wet, as in a camping context, wet <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> or spare clothing could post a risk to a camper's safety, due to the poor insulative qualities of wet clothing or <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags.</b>|$|R

25|$|The station {{provides}} crew {{quarters for}} {{each member of}} the expedition's crew, with two 'sleep stations' in the Zvezda and four more installed in Harmony. The American quarters are private, approximately person-sized soundproof booths. The Russian crew quarters include a small window, but provide less ventilation and sound proofing. A crew member can sleep in a crew quarter in a tethered <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag,</b> listen to music, use a laptop, and store personal items in a large drawer or in nets attached to the module's walls. The module also provides a reading lamp, a shelf and a desktop. Visiting crews have no allocated sleep module, and attach a <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag</b> to an available space on a wall. It is possible to sleep floating freely through the station, but this is generally avoided because of the possibility of bumping into sensitive equipment. It is important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts can wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide has formed around their heads.|$|E

50|$|Glenn {{takes them}} to the next challenge. He asks for 4 of the best swimmers, which are Paul, Chris, Natalie, and Mel. He then {{explains}} that this challenge might decide the entire game, as their survival equipment is in waterproof bags in the raging rapids. The contestants must get the bags out of the rapids to keep the things in them (the list of items in each bag and their release is on a chart at the rapids.) They have 1 minute to memorize the chart to decide the bags they will keep. The first pack has bear mare, a six pack of beer, 2 <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags,</b> and wipes. They missed the wipes and <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags,</b> but got the beer and the bear mare. The second pack has 2 <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags,</b> a tin opener, a bottle of whiskey, and a loo roll. They get everything but the loo roll this time. After two misses, Mel is replaced with Dafydd. The third pack contains the pen knife, keys to the log cabin, dried rations, and 2 more <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags.</b> This bag is critical, as the keys are in it. The pen knife, rations, and the <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> are saved. The keys are lost. In the fourth pack, there is 5 blankets, luxury food, bars of chocolate, and 2 more <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags.</b> The chocolate, blankets, and <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags</b> are saved. The fifth bag has repellant, a tent, a cuddly toy, and 5 more blankets. If they don't get the tent, they sleep outside. For this run, Natalie and Paul switch. Only the blankets are saved. In the final pack is a torch, the prize money, 2 <b>sleeping</b> <b>bags,</b> {{and a bottle of}} whiskey. Only the money is saved. After the challenge, Glenn offers them the keys to the cabin for half of the prize money, telling them they cannot expect to survive if they sleep outside due to bear attacks. Of course, they say yes.|$|R

Cutting a small hole in the resonant head can also produce a more muffled tone, and allows manipulation in internally placed muffling. The Evans EQ pad places a pad against the batterhead and, when struck, the pad moves off the head momentarily, then returns to rest against the head, thus reducing the sustain without choking the tone.|$|E

While in the harness, she wore only diapers and could only move her extremities. At night he usually tied her into a <b>sleeping</b> <b>bag</b> and placed her in a crib with a metal-screen cover, keeping her arms and legs immobilized, and researchers believed that he sometimes left her on the child's toilet overnight.|$|E
