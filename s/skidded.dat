By using British Pendulum Tester, <b>skid</b> resistance of sidewalk was measured in a wet after snow-melt, sludgy, and snowy conditions. METHODS: The <b>skid</b> resistance was measured on surfaces including Concrete Interlocking Block Paving, Colour Asphalt Pavement, Granite Block Paving, Manhole, and Tactile Paving for Visually Impaired.

5|$|Before the Tests, Fingleton {{expected}} the English batsmen to struggle against Miller and Lindwall; he believed that, accustomed to prolific scoring against low-quality bowling in county cricket, these batsmen {{would be unable}} to adapt to the demands of facing world-class opposition. England won the toss and batted first on the opening morning of the First Test at Trent Bridge. There had been overnight rain, which meant that the pitch would initially be favourable towards fast bowlers. Opening the bowling with Lindwall, Miller induced an edge from Washbrook in his first over, but it went to ground. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton with a faster ball, leaving England at 1/9. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton for three with a faster ball that <b>skidded</b> off the pitch to leave England at 9/1. The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the pitch of the ball, thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad, but praised Miller for his ability to make occasional deliveries skid on faster, surprising the batsman.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the large 1960 team, the teams in subsequent Olympics were scaled back and were the smallest since 1936. The 1964 Winter Olympics were marred by the deaths of Australian skier Ross Milne—who crashed during a practice run—and a British luge competitor. Milne had <b>skidded</b> off the course and crashed into a tree. Members of the IOC asked the AOF whether Milne was negligently sent to compete {{despite a lack of}} experience, which the AOF denied. The Australian manager John Wagner blamed the accident on a large group of skiers who had congregated lower down on the course during the practice session, forcing Milne to take evasive action. The Australian delegation felt that the training arrangements had not been enacted strictly, making the course unsafe. Australia was represented by five skiers—excluding Milne. Christine Smith placed in the top 30 in two events, but the remainder placed 40th or lower, although all were in {{the bottom half of the}} field.

Assessing tree regeneration by the effect of the <b>skid</b> trail from harvest operation is important to determine the recovery rate of the forest stand. A study was conducted to accomplish the following objectives, (i) to measure the tree regeneration rates at different distance from <b>skid</b> trails, and (ii) to evaluate the dominance and species diversity of regenerated trees. A total of five plots with size of 50 m by 2 m were established in two <b>skid</b> trails of natural forest that has been logged in 2012. Each plot contains five sub-plots of 2 m by 2 m in different locations namely <b>skid</b> track, edge and forest.

When investigating police officers arrived at the hospital, they asked Schmerber to submit a sample of his blood, but Schmerber refused.

The blood sample indicated that Schmerber was intoxicated, and he was placed under arrest. The blood sample was ultimately admitted into evidence at trial, and Schmerber was convicted for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquors. Schmerber objected to the admissibility of the blood sample, claiming that the police violated his rights to due process, his privilege against self-incrimination, his right to counsel, and his right not to be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures. The Appellate Department of the California Superior Court rejected Schmerber's arguments, and the California District Court of Appeal declined to review his case.|$|E
40|$|Harvest traffic {{with heavy}} {{equipment}} causes damage to forest soils. Whereas increased soil {{damage has been}} reported with increasing harvest equipment traffic and on increasing slope gradients, {{it is unclear how}} much soil damage is caused by different directions of <b>skidding.</b> We examined the effects of traffic frequency, <b>skid</b> trail slope and <b>skidding</b> direction on the dry bulk density and total porosity of <b>skidding</b> trail soil in an Iranian temperate forest. The studied treatments included combinations of three different traffic frequencies (3, 7, and 12 passes of a rubber-tired skidder), three levels of slope (20 %) and two <b>skidding</b> directions (uphill and downhill). The impact on soil properties was greatest during the skidder initial passes. On steep slopes, only three skidder passes were required to cause substantial increases in soil bulk density relative to control plots, regardless of <b>skidding</b> direction.

In general, fewer uphill skidder passes were required to achieve substantial soil disturbance than was the case for downhill <b>skidding,</b> possibly because skidders move more slowly when travelling upwards and uphill <b>skidding</b> places greater loads on the skidder rear axle...|$|R

During this spell, Toshack conceded only seven runs from eight overs, but was taken off as Bradman wanted to take the new ball and utilise Lindwall and Johnston. In the meantime, Dollery had continued to bat effectively, watching the ball closely onto his bat, and scoring three leg side boundaries from Johnston's bowling.

5|$|A right-arm fast bowler of express pace, Lindwall {{was widely}} {{regarded}} as the greatest pace bowler of his era and one of the finest of all time. Together with Keith Miller, Lindwall formed a new-ball pairing {{regarded as one of the}} greatest to have played cricket. Lindwall was known for his classical style, with a smooth and rhythmic run-up and textbook side-on bowling action, from which he generated his trademark outswinger which moved away late at high pace. Lindwall mixed his outswinger with a searing yorker, subtle changes of pace and an intimidating bouncer that <b>skidded</b> at the heads of opposing batsmen. Later in his career, Lindwall developed an inswinger, which together with his variety, pace and control made him the most feared paceman of his time. Lindwall was a fine all round cricketer; he was a hard-hitting batsman who scored two centuries at Test level and often improved Australia's position with his lower order batting. Lindwall's best known performance was his role in leading the Australian bowling during the 1948 tour of England under Don Bradman; the 1948 Australian team went through the tour undefeated and gained the sobriquet The Invincibles which saw it regarded as one of the finest teams in cricketing history. Lindwall's place in Australian cricket history saw him inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the ten inaugural members. In 2000, Lindwall was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century.|$|E

In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over bowled by Pollard, Hassett fell for 13 on the second ball, which lifted suddenly after bouncing. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball {{in the same place}} as he did to Hassett, but this time it <b>skidded</b> off the pitch and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as it cut off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get behind the ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett. The crowd, sensing the importance of the two quick wickets, in particular that of Bradman, who had been so productive at Headingley, erupted. This left Australia struggling at 3/68, but a rapid counterattack by the middle and lower order took them to 9/457 at stumps and eventually 458 on the fourth morning.|$|E
