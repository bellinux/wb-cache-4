50|$|The <b>SPAD</b> S.XI or <b>SPAD</b> 11 was a French two-seat biplane {{reconnaissance}} aircraft of the First World War. The <b>SPAD</b> 11 {{was the work}} of Louis Béchereau, chief designer of the Société Pour L'Aviation et ses Dérivés (<b>SPAD),</b> who also designed the highly successful <b>SPAD</b> 7 and <b>SPAD</b> 13 single-seat fighter aircraft. It was developed under military specification C2, which called for a two-seat fighter aircraft. As a result of its failure to meet the levels of performance and agility demanded by the C2 specification, the <b>SPAD</b> 11 was used, along with the more successful Salmson 2 and Breguet 14, to replace aging Sopwith 1½ Strutter and Dorand AR {{reconnaissance aircraft}}. Persistent problems with the <b>SPAD</b> 11 led to its early replacement by the <b>SPAD</b> S.XVI or <b>SPAD</b> 16 variant.|$|R
25|$|In late 1923, Nungesser {{headed up}} an ill-starred voyage to Havana. Having been invited by the {{secretary}} to the President, José Manuel Cortina, when the latter was vacationing in Paris, Nungesser seemed to have assumed he had received an official tender from the Cuban government. At any rate, Nungesser brought four World War I <b>SPADs</b> with him, {{as well as two}} fellow veterans. Nungesser based the <b>SPADs</b> with the Cuban Air Corps at Campo Colombia. He then proposed that the Cubans buy forty or more airplanes from him. When the Cuban Army pleaded lack of budget, Nungesser so aggressively importuned the Cuban Congress that the Cuban army Chief of Staff, General Alberto Herrera y Franchi, threatened to throw Nungesser's party out of the country. On 10 February 1924, the French ace ended his Cuban sojourn with a fundraising flying exhibition, proceeds going to charity.|$|E
25|$|All new or altered signals {{or which}} had had {{multiple}} <b>SPADs</b> {{should have been}} reviewed for sighting issues by a 'signal sighting committee', but none had been held for signals around Paddington since Railtrack assumed responsibility for this in April 1994.

The company's trainer was patterned after successful European designs; for instance, the engine was a Wright Hispano Suiza of the type used by the French <b>Spads.</b> In practice, the VE-7's performance was much better than usual for a trainer, and comparable to the best fighters, and the Army ordered 1,000 of an improved design called the VE-8.

25|$|On 3 September 1917, he {{was wounded}} in action while in combat against several German aircraft. He then {{received}} the Médaille militaire for his valor; the award citation shows he had risen {{to the rank of}} Adjutant. He was also awarded the Belgian Croix de guerre. After recuperation, he returned to combat; as his squadron had upgraded to <b>Spads,</b> his final four victories were probably scored flying this type. At any rate, he ran his winning streak to eight confirmed victories by 7 June 1918, and was promoted to sous lieutenant in the process.|$|E
25|$|In early 1917, Nungesser had {{to return}} to {{hospital}} for treatment of injuries but managed to avoid being grounded. He had pushed his score to 30 by 17 August 1917, when he downed his second Gotha bomber. Injuries from a car crash in December got him a month's respite as an instructor before he returned to flying combat with Escadrille 65. He still flew a Nieuport, even though the squadron had re-equipped with <b>Spads.</b> By May 1918, he had 35 victories, including a shared victory each with Jacques Gérard and Eugène Camplan, and was raised to Officer of the Légion d'honneur.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} over the years a number of {{proposals}} or recommendations for the risk assessment of the signalling in the Paddington area; {{none of them was}} carried into effect. Multiple <b>SPADs</b> at SN109 in August 1998 should have triggered a risk assessment; none took place. An inquiry into a February 1998 SPAD at SN109 had already recommended risk assessment of signalling on the Paddington – Ladbroke Grove bi-directional lines; this and many other inquiry recommendations had not been implemented: the Railtrack employee with formal responsibility for action-tracking had been told his responsibility ended once someone accepted an action, and did not extend to checking that they had acted upon it.|$|E

50|$|<b>SPAD,</b> MARS and {{continuous}} veno-venous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) were compared in vitro {{with regard to}} detoxification capacity. <b>SPAD</b> and CVVHDF showed a significantly greater reduction of ammonia compared with MARS. No significant differences could be observed between <b>SPAD,</b> MARS and CVVHDF concerning other water-soluble substances. However, <b>SPAD</b> enabled a significantly greater bilirubin reduction than MARS. Bilirubin serves as an important marker substance for albumin-bound (non water-soluble) substances. Concerning the reduction of bile acids {{no significant differences between}} <b>SPAD</b> and MARS were seen. It was concluded that the detoxification capacity of <b>SPAD</b> is similar or even higher when compared with the more sophisticated, more complex and hence more expensive MARS.|$|R

500|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, signals passed at danger (<b>SPADs)</b> were {{increasingly}} {{perceived as a}} significant danger to the public. Only the Great Western Railway truly accepted the challenge posed. Prior even to 1910, it commenced installing Automatic Train Control (ATC), a system where each distant signal {{was accompanied by a}} ramp between the tracks with which a shoe on the locomotive would make contact as it passed over it. When the signal denoted [...] "clear", an electric current would pass through the ramp which was detected by the shoe, thereby sounding a bell in the cab. With the signal at danger, the electric current would be cut off and when the shoe detected this it would activate a warning horn. In later forms, the brakes would be applied should the driver fail to acknowledge the warning.|$|E
500|$|The dogfight {{developed}} over Poelkapelle at about 18:30 hours. The Germans chasing Voss found themselves stalemated by British Sopwith Camels, {{as well as}} some <b>SPADs</b> and Bristol F.2 Fighters patrolling under the overcast. Two flights of the elite 56 Squadron formed a lower layer of British patrols at 1,800meters (6,000feet) altitude. Below that, Lieutenant Harold A. Hamersley, flying as a rear guard to his squadronmates in 60 Squadron, had a wary eye on a nearby enemy formation of 20 to 25 German aircraft. At about 18:25 hours, he turned to help what he believed to be a Nieuport threatened by a German Albatros, firing a short burst of machine-gun fire to distract the German. The [...] "Nieuport", Voss's misidentified Fokker Triplane, rounded on Hamersley and raked him with Spandau fire. Hamersley flung his Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a into a spin that went inverted, with Voss continuing to fire, holing his wings and engine cowling. Lieutenant Robert L. Chidlaw-Roberts, a squadronmate of Hamersley, rushed to his aid. Within seconds, Voss shredded Chidlaw-Roberts's rudder bar, also driving him out of the fray into a forced landing.|$|E
500|$|Wings {{was shot}} and {{completed}} on a budget of $2 million at Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas between September 7, 1926 and April 7, 1927. Primary scout aircraft flown in the film were Thomas-Morse MB-3s standing in for American-flown <b>SPADs</b> and Curtiss P-1 Hawks painted in German livery. Developing the techniques needed for filming closeups of the pilots {{in the air and}} capturing the speed and motion of the planes onscreen took time, and little usable footage was produced in the first two months. Wellman soon realized that Kelly Field didn't have adequate numbers of planes or skilled pilots which were needed to perform the aerial maneuvers and had to request technical assistance and a supply of planes and pilots from Washington. The Air Corps sent six planes and pilots from the 1st Pursuit Group stationed at Selfridge Field near Detroit, including 2d Lt. [...] who became Wellman's adviser. Irvine was responsible for engineering an airborne camera system to provide close-ups and for the planning of the dogfights, and when one of the pilots broke his neck, performed in one of the battle scenes himself.|$|E
50|$|The <b>SPAD</b> S.G1 and <b>SPAD</b> S.G2 were French {{single seat}} tractor biplanes of ca 1915/16, {{following}} similar arrangements to the <b>SPAD</b> S.A2 family with the propeller and engine {{buried in the}} fuselage and a pod suspended {{in front of the}} engine.|$|R
50|$|Further {{problems}} were encountered with the <b>SPAD</b> 11's Hispano-Suiza 8B engine. Some aircraft were {{fitted with a}} 12-cylinder Renault engine, but this lowered the aircraft's poor performance yet more. Handling {{problems were}} encountered, including tail-heaviness, making the aircraft tiring to fly, and a propensity to stall. In spite of these flaws, the <b>SPAD</b> was still superior to the Sopwiths and Dorands, and 12 squadrons were fully equipped with <b>SPAD</b> 11s. Some 1,000 <b>SPAD</b> 11s were built, {{most of which were}} out of service by the autumn of 1918, generally replaced by the <b>SPAD</b> S.XVI.|$|R

As Kroll's diary related, the two pilots had locked in a circling dogfight beginning at 5300 meters (about 17,400 feet) and devolving down to 800 meters (about 2600 feet). Dorme's Spad suddenly nosed over and barreled straight into the ground, bursting into flames upon impact. Dorme's body was so disfigured it could only be identified by his watch.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{privatisation}} {{being on}} the agenda, in Yorkshire the Wharfedale line was electrified starting in 1994 by British Rail.

40|$|The {{integrated}} circuit design of Single Photon Avalanche Diode (<b>SPAD)</b> with quenching circuit in CMOS is highly desirable photon detection at high rates, but low counting rates constrain image acquisition rates and dynamic range. The characterization should primarily define the dead time of quenching <b>SPAD</b> circuit {{in order to}} estimate the <b>SPAD</b> performance prior fabrication. This paper reports the development and characterization of the mathematical model <b>SPAD</b> on passively quenched <b>SPAD</b> circuit with ballast resistor. An improved model in defining the dead time (tD) response for <b>SPAD</b> is used to characterize the performance of 8 × 1 passively quenched <b>SPAD</b> array.
