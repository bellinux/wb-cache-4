500|$|The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) {{tested a}} C3 Picasso Confort [...] model with {{standard}} equipment, including: a single forward airbag for each front seat, a <b>speed</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>device,</b> but no ESC. The vehicle was scored {{on the basis}} of: child and adult injury, including whiplash risk from the seating, a pedestrian front impact rating, safety equipment and clear labels detailing how to disable some features. The results of the front end tests were mixed, with the bumper scoring all available points, but the vehicle was penalised {{for the lack of}} protection and the potential damage caused if a pedestrian is struck by the bonnet. Protection inside the car was scored highly for almost every seat, and for adult and child protection; it lost points for its use of forward-facing restraints, which can be fatal in an accident if an infant is hit by an airbag. The C3 Picasso was also penalised for offering very poor whiplash protection in the driver's seatscoring nothing in two of the three tests and then losing points for the position of the unadjusted restraint. Overall, the vehicle scored four of five stars, less than most vehicles the Euro NCAP compares it with, which were released around the same time.|$|E
50|$|The Citan Traveliner {{received}} four passenger {{stars in}} the Euro NCAP safety tests. The Mercedes-Benz CITAN Kombi was first tested by Euro NCAP in April 2013, and was given a three star rating.Mercedes-Benz indicated {{at that time that}} they would improve the safety performance of the vehicle, especially thedeployment of the side airbag and the installation of child restraints; and that they would provide a seatbelt reminderfor the front passenger seat and make the <b>speed</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>device</b> comply with Euro NCAP's requirements. Thesechanges are now in production and Euro NCAP has re-assessed the vehicle. Several tests have been re-done toassess the changes that Mercedes-Benz have made. Where the performance is not influenced by the changes, testresults have been carried over from the original assessment.|$|E

40|$|Crashes {{in which}} lorries or vans are {{involved}} are often serious, {{especially for the}} crash opponent. Lorries are not only involved in crashes because of their drivers' unsafe behaviour (freights falling off, rollovers, jack-knifing), but also because other road users take too little account of them. Many road users do not realize {{that they can be}} positioned in the lorry's blind area or that a lorry can swerve out. Although delivery vans are smaller than lorries, they still are bigger and heavier than cars and their rear view is not as good. That is why the crash causes of delivery vans are often different from those of cars. Infrastructural measures, such as target-group lanes and keeping heavy freight traffic away from urban areas can result in safer lorry and van traffic. In addition, (intelligent) facilities in the vehicle, such as <b>speed</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>devices,</b> can be used. Yet {{it is also important to}} encourage a safety culture in haulage companies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Communication {{bandwidth}} {{has become}} limited to 40 GHz due to electronic switching <b>speed</b> <b>limitation.</b> Available <b>devices</b> operate at 40 GHz and beyond are just prototype models. Even the 40 - 50 GHz switching devices are under constant investigation. Nanotechnology {{has failed to}} cope with ever increasing electronic switching speed demands. Probably we require picotechnology now and femtotechnology in next few years to accelerate the switching speed limits to THz regime through novel photonic or light switches yet to be explored. Optical fibres offer greater than 25 THz bandwidth {{that can not be}} utilized due to obvious reasons. Data communication rate was increased to a few THz level through OTDM/DWDM techniques but EDFA noise, bandwidth-distance product and Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) limitations do not allow to further increase multiple laser wavelengths carriers multiplexing without proportional increase in electronic switching speeds. This paper reviews basics of the electronic and optical communication limitations and proposes thin film integrated optics based photonic strategies to overcome the impounding bottlenecks.
