50|$|Under Senate {{impeachment}} rules, {{the committee}} could gather evidence, <b>summon</b> <b>witnesses,</b> hear testimony, and present {{a report to}} the full Senate.

The Senate's use of a committee was controversial and some feared it gave Claiborne a basis on which to criticize the proceedings. Others defended the procedure and argued the Senate was not bound by federal courts traditions and standards.|$|R

50|$|Conduct {{money is}} money paid in some legal systems {{to a person}} under the {{compulsion}} of a <b>summons</b> to <b>witness</b> (subpoena) {{to pay for their}} expenses to attend in court. It generally incorporates a daily rate for each day the witness must attend in court (with a one-day minimum), plus a travel allowance to allow the witness to get to the place of the hearing. Generally, conduct money must be delivered with the summons for it to have legal effect. In some jurisdictions, however, failure to provide conduct money at the time the summons is served is only an irregularity but not fatal to the validity of the <b>summons.</b> <b>Witnesses</b> are generally entitled to additional conduct money if their attendance is required on more days than anticipated. Moreover, witnesses who are required to make an overnight stay to attend in court on more than one day are generally entitled to an allowance for accommodation and meals.|$|R

50|$|Caracciolo {{was charged}} with high treason; he had asked to be judged by British officers, which was refused, nor was he allowed to <b>summon</b> <b>witnesses</b> in his defence.

Even the customary twenty-four hours respite for confession was denied him, and his request to be shot instead of hanged refused. The sentence was duly carried out on 30 June 1799.|$|R
50|$|The next morning, {{the servant}} Sosias announces Thebes' victory over Athens {{and the return}} of the Theban army. He sees a double of himself, who is {{actually}} Mercury, who acted as guard the night prior. Confusion follows. Alkmene then sees Amphytrion for what she thinks is the second time so soon after his recent return. Amphitryon becomes suspicious of his wife's fidelity, and <b>summons</b> <b>witnesses</b> to attest that he did not leave the army camp during the night. Alkmene is pained at these suspicions. However, Jupiter appears and tells Alkmene that her partner the night before was no mortal, but the supreme god himself.|$|R
50|$|Tiberius {{was forced}} to order an investigation, and after briefly hearing both sides, decided to defer {{the case to the}} senate. Tiberius made no effort to conceal his sentiments: the Pisones were {{longtime}} supporters of the Claudians, with their support going back to the early days of Octavian. A public trial was held, and Tiberius made allowances for Piso to <b>summon</b> <b>witnesses</b> of all social orders, including slaves, and he was given more time to plea than the prosecution, but it made no difference: before the sentencing, Piso had died. He committed suicide, though Tacitus supposes that Tiberius may have had him murdered, fearing his own implication in Germanicus' death.|$|R
