40|$|In {{order to}} detect phleboviruses’ natural {{infection}} in sandflies, an entomological survey was carried out, from May to October in 2007 and 2008, in Arrábida {{region in the}} south of Portugal. The isolation of a new phlebovirus was achieved after inoculation of a sandfly pool homogenate in Vero E 6 cells. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome sequences from the Small, Medium and Large, segments obtained with Next Generation sequencing, we can assume that the new phlebovirus, provisionally named Arrabida virus, is closely related to Massilia, Granada and Punique viruses. This is the first isolation of a sandfly-borne phlebovirus from the <b>Sandfly</b> Naples <b>Fever</b> Virus group in Portugal.

40|$|Background: Phleboviruses cause <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> but {{isolates}} are rare. Objectives: To analyse {{samples from}} concurrent outbreaks of suspected <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> in the Mediterranean provinces of Adana, Izmir {{and the central}} province of Ankara, Turkey. Study design: Samples from acute cases were analysed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Virus isolation was attempted and pyrosequencing performed. Results: In IFA 38 % of 106 samples tested scored IgM positive for <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> Sicillian virus (SFSV), 12 % for SFSV/sandfly fever Cyprus Virus (SFCV) and only 4 % for SFCV. A <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> Sicilian type virus designated <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> Turkey virus (SFTV) was isolated. The S-segment sequence of SFTV had a homology of 98 % to that of SFCV.

We conducted this study {{to determine the extent of}} past SFV infection in a group of healthy Iranian military personnel in Ilam province on the western border of Iran. A total of 201 serum samples were tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to detect four common <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> virus serotypes. Demographic data were also collected. Overall, 37 samples (18. 4 %) were positive for specific IgG antibodies to sandfly viruses. <b>Sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> Sicilian virus (SFSV) and <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> Naples virus (SFNV) were the most common serotypes. A positive test was inversely related to nativity (P< 0. 01) but was not associated with age (P= 0. 163), duration of presence in the border region (P= 0. 08) or employment status (P= 0. 179). Our findings indicate that past SFV infection is common among military personnel in the western border region of Iran, a Leishmania-endemic region. Therefore, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of troops presenting with acute febrile illness in similar settings...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: <b>Sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> virus (SFV) serotypes <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> Naples virus, <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> Sicilian virus, and <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> Cyprus virus cause febrile diseases, whereas Toscana virus (TOSV) is {{responsible}} for aseptic meningoencephalitis. Diagnosis and surveillance of TOSV depend heavily on virus serology, and various commercial assays utilizing various antigen sources and formats have been available. The {{aim of this study}} was to perform comparative evaluation of commercially available serological assays for anti-TOSV immunoglobulins. Materials and Methods: A collection of 120 sera from healthy blood donors from an endemic region, previously identified to be reactive for antibodies against various SFV serotypes by indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT), was reevaluated for IgG/IgM via IIFT, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and an immunoblot assay manufactured by Euroimmun, Diesse, and Mikrogen, respectively. Virus neutralization test (VNT) was performed for 99 sera using standard TOSV, <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> Sicilian virus, and <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> Naples virus strains. Results: A total of 89 samples (74. 2 %) were reactive for TOSV IgG in at least one of the commercial assays, and 31 samples (31. 3 %) were reactive in VNT for various SFV serotypes. Average percentage agreements among commercial assays and between VNT and the commercial assays were noted as 57. 8 % and 62. 6 %, respectively. No significant correlation between assay results and VNT titers was observed. SFV IgM antibodies were detected in a total of eight samples (6. 7 %) via IIFT, which were nonreactive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and VNT. Discussion: Commercial diagnostic immunoassays displayed slight to fair agreement for TOSV IgG as assessed via kappa and percentage agreement values. The results could only be confirmed via virus neutralization in a portion of the samples, and overall agreement between the commercial assays and VNT was slight. Commercial assays such as immunoblot can be used in addition to VNT for confirmation of TOSV exposure...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> viruses are {{transmitted}} by {{the bite of}} phlebotomine sandflies; serotypes <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> Naples virus, <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> Sicilian virus and <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> Cyprus virus cause febrile illness, whereas Toscana virus (TOSV) may cause neuroinvasive infections. Although TOSV is an important cause of aseptic meningitis in central and southern Italy, {{in many cases the}} infection is asymptomatic, leading to underestimation of the actual spread of the virus. This serosurvey aimed to assess the seroprevalence of TOSV in a random population in Siena (Tuscany, central Italy) in 2003 - 2004 and 2013 - 2014 and Bari (Apulia, southern Italy) in 2004 and 2015. 2132 serum samples were tested for the presence of anti-TOSV/SFNV IgG by means of ELISA and IFA commercial tests. Seroprevalence rates were compared in the two cities and over a ten-year period in the same city. Seroprevalence results in the Siena population (22. 95 % in 2003 - 2004 vs 26. 75 % in 2013 - 2014) confirmed the endemic circulation of TOSV and closely related viruses in central Italy, without major changes over the last decade, while no significant prevalence was observed in Bari (2. 90 % in 2004 vs 1. 85 % in 2015) ...|$|E

Infections are endemic in the Mediterranean basin and data on SFV activity in Turkey are limited. In this study, sera from 1533 blood donors from the Ankara, Konya, Eskisehir and Zonguldak provinces of Turkey were evaluated for SFV exposure by indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT) and confirmed by virus neutralization test (VNT). One hundred and two patients with central nervous system (CNS) infections of unknown aetiology were also tested via IIFT and real-time reverse-transcription PCR for SFV/TOSV. Rate of overall IgG reactivity in IIFT was 32. 9 % (505 / 1533) among blood donors. TOSV exposure was confirmed by VNT in all study regions. Exposure to the recently-identified serotype <b>sandfly</b> <b>fever</b> Turkish virus, as evaluated by VNT, was revealed in Konya and Ankara.

Oligonucleotide fingerprint analyses of Karimabad and Punta Toro virus RNA species indicated that their L, M, and S RNA species are unique. By polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis it was determined for Karimabad virus that the apparent molecular weights of its L, M, and S RNA species are 2. 6 X 10 (6), 2. 2 X 10 (6), and 0. 8 X 10 (6), respectively. For Punta Toro virus, the apparent molecular weights of its L, M, and S RNA species are 2. 8 X 10 (6), 1. 8 X 10 (6), and 0. 75 X 10 (6), respectively.
