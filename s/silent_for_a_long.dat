2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1940, Ziolkowski spent three weeks with Standing Bear at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, {{discussing}} land ownership issues and learning about Crazy Horse and the Lakota way of life. According to Ziolkowski, [...] "Standing Bear grew very angry when {{he spoke of the}} broken Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868). That was the one I'd read about in which the President promised the Black Hills would belong to the Indians forever. I remember how his old eyes flashed out of that dark mahogany face, then he would shake his head and fall <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And without looking back, {{he got out of the}} car and went through that door.|$|E

60|$|Remember! But {{she said}} nothing. She raised her eyes <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant. It {{was but a}} glance; a little, tearful, timid glance. It kept Joe <b>silent</b> though, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> unusually <b>long</b> time. He {{was leaning}} back in his chair, looking up through the cloud of blue tobacco smoke to the ceiling. In {{reflection}} his features seemed to have assumed a graver and somewhat weary expression.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Joyce, after a moment's hesitation, {{led him to}} {{the door}} of the room and stood aside for him to enter. After looking down into the <b>silent</b> face <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time he asked, in stately fashion, [...] "May I make {{momentary}} examination of the body?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then we were <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while, silent, {{with our}} eyes fixed upon the sky.|$|E
60|$|He was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, {{and then}} he said what I knew was in his mind.|$|E
60|$|We were <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, when {{he rolled}} over and began to poke with his finger in the bank.|$|E
60|$|Lenore {{turned away}} her face, shocked {{to her heart}} by his tragic passion. Dorn was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> what seemed <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time.|$|R

Additionally, to ensure {{fairness}} for the APs who may remain in the <b>silent</b> mode <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time and starve for TXOP, we have proposed Algorithm 2, <b>a</b> fairness algorithm <b>for</b> TXOPs.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Silent</b> {{she stood}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> moment; then she edged nearer to him, {{and her voice}} murmured back: [...] "What if I account it no presumption?" ...|$|R
60|$|He was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, {{unable to}} be in {{communication}} with her {{while she was in}} this state of opposition.|$|E
60|$|Mr Swiveller was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while. By and bye, {{he began}} to talk again, inquiring how long he had been there.|$|E
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head slowly, and then was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while. At last, looking at him with solemn eyes, she whispered, 'To kill him.' ...|$|E
60|$|That letter fell indeed like a pitiless {{searchlight}} {{into all}} that region of differences ignored, over {{which we had}} built the vaulted convention of our complete mutual understanding. In my memory {{it seems to me}} now as though we hung <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> quite <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time over the evasions that were there so abruptly revealed.|$|R
60|$|A week or {{so after}} their being shut up here, Andrew Black stood one {{afternoon}} leaning against the headstone of a grave on which Quentin Dick and Will Wallace were seated. It had been raining, and the grass and their garments were very wet. A leaden sky overhead seemed to have deepened their despair, <b>for</b> they remained <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> unusually <b>long</b> time.|$|R
6000|$|When I had {{finished}} my narration, bringing matters {{up to the}} moment when Miss Trelawny had gone out for her walk--I thought of her as [...] "Miss Trelawny', not as 'Margaret' now, {{in the presence of}} her father--he remained <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> quite <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. It was probably two or three minutes; but it seemed interminable. All at once he turned and said to me briskly: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{shall not}} dwell upon that painful {{farewell}} which wrung our hearts, and made us <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> long while after {{the ship was}} tossing in the short seas of the Channel.|$|E
60|$|He was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, redreaming {{the dreams}} {{that he had}} dreamed eight years ago, but through them all ran, as sheet-lightning through golden cloud, the light of Mrs. Hauksbee's violet eyes.|$|E
60|$|He was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, {{while the}} waves purred about {{the base of}} the big red {{sandstone}} rock and the boy returned to his Crusoe. Finally Robert Turner roused himself from his reverie.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Maryon sat <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> so <b>long</b> <b>a</b> while, that I {{believed}} {{she had done}} speaking to me for one time. However, she had not; for by-and-by {{she said in a}} distinct clear tone: ...|$|R
60|$|The cannon were <b>silent,</b> <b>for</b> loading was <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{operation}} in those days; {{but by the}} colonel's orders only half the soldiers had taken part in the first volley, and the others now poured in their fire.|$|R
60|$|He stopped once more, and was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> so <b>long</b> <b>an</b> {{interval}} that John Westlock said 'Go on.' Martin {{had never}} removed {{his eyes from}} his face, but was so absorbed in horror and astonishment {{that he could not}} speak.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Belding {{listened to}} him, and was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time while {{she held the}} {{stricken}} Nell to her breast. Then she opposed his convictions with that quiet strength so characteristic of her arguments.|$|E
6000|$|They sat <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, {{while the}} wind tore round the shed, Bert spearing at the stick, and Anson {{watching}} the hens as they vainly tried to navigate in the wind. Finally Anson spoke: ...|$|E
60|$|Again he was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, {{while his}} eyes {{remained}} fixed, as usual, on the horizon. Suddenly the gaze became intent, and, leaning forward with an eager expression, he shaded {{his eyes with}} his hand.|$|E
6000|$|The good priest sat <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> so <b>long</b> <b>a</b> {{time that}} Myles {{began to think}} he had not heard the question.

6000|$|Aunt Rebecca was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> so <b>long</b> <b>a</b> {{space that}} Jane Lavinia {{had time to}} pass through the phases of hope and fear and despair and {{resignation}} before she said, more grimly than ever, [...] "If your mind is set on going, go you will, I suppose. It doesn't seem to me that I have anything to say in the matter, Jane Lavinia." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir John was <b>silent</b> again <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, {{and at last}} he said, very composedly, 'Steenie, {{this story}} of yours {{concerns}} the honour of many a noble family besides mine; and if it be a leasing-making, to keep yourself out of my danger, the least you can expect {{is to have a}} redhot iron driven through your tongue, and that will be as bad as scauding your fingers wi' a redhot chanter. But yet it may be true, Steenie; and if the money cast up I shall not know what to think of it. But where shall we find the Cat's Cradle? There are cats enough about the old house, but I think they kitten without the ceremony of bed or cradle.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fresh air {{and water}} and exercise," [...] said he, {{and sat down on}} the grass. He was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while, and so was I. For a notion had struck me, though I hardly dared to give it voice.|$|E
60|$|The {{girl was}} <b>silent.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time she sat, staring {{down into the}} water, resting her head against her knee. Harris began to become impatient. He fidgeted back and forth, resting first on one leg {{and then on the}} other.|$|E
60|$|She was <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, stitching. He was aware, poignantly, of {{the round}} shape of her head, very intimate, compelling. She lifted her head and sighed. The blood burned in him, her voice ran to him like fire.|$|E
6000|$|I sat <b>silent</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> great <b>long</b> {{time after}} this, nor could I {{think of one}} word to say, for {{of all the things}} which my mind had forecasted, this was the very furthest from my imaginings. So I sat staring at the pirate captain, who, upon his part, sat gazing back again at me, {{answering}} my look with a grin. I had been well assured that Captain Leach had stolen the jewel, but was it possible that I had misjudged him in suspecting that he had betrayed us to the pirates, and that they, finding him alive upon the vessel, whence he had not had sufficient time to escape, had thereupon instantly murthered him, as is their custom upon such occasions? [...] "And tell me this," [...] said I at last, [...] "was it through Captain Leach's machinations that we were betrayed into your hands?" ...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral {{artery disease}} (PAD) is {{frequently}} overlooked {{because of its}} <b>silent</b> evolution <b>for</b> quite <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period and because {{it has not been}} considered as harmful as other atherothrombosis complications such as myocardial infarction or stroke. PAD is readily diagnosed by measuring the ankle brachial index (ABI). A reduced ABI is able to identify an asymptomatic PAD in a high risk patient and provides a very valuable predictor of cardiovascular events allowing to better profile the individual risk of the patient. The awareness of PAD as a mark of a generalized atherothrombosis disease holds the potential to increase the doctor's view of the true individual risk of his patient and to enforce cardiovascular risk prevention as suggested by recent studies...|$|R
50|$|Pammi and Chandar {{sat with}} bon fire, Pammi says today she feels all her procrastinations have worked. Chandar {{says she has}} helped people so much, that is why. Pammi asks Chandar to read a poem as he is a poet. Chandar asks if she doesn’t like his silence. Pammi says she has really been <b>silent</b> in life <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. Chandar says when two people even sit together, their silence talks. She asks Chandar to walk, he doesn’t agree. She asks him to drop her till tent, and gives hand. He takes it after a while. They walk along the tents. Chandar says it is his tent, Pammi says hers is also here.In the tent, Pammi felt cold as she read some file. Chandar comes inside to call her for dinner, she was having fever. Chandar notices her tent was torn and says he will sleep here, she must take his tent. Pammi asks if he has some problem {{sleeping}} with her, she can wake up for the whole night. They come to Pammi’s tent, the administrator comes inside. He tells Chandar that he already told Pammi that the tent is torn but she insisted to exchange her tent with Chandar’s. He requests Chandar to sleep {{with him in his}} tent so that a lady can be adjusted with Pammi in this one. Chandar goes with administrator. Pammi sits in the tent alone.|$|R
