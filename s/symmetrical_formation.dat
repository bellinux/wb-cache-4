The labyrinth and the lateral line organs of lampreys have structural and functional similarity. An important difference between the two structures is that the arrangement of the lateral line organs are such that they are sensitive to relative motion of the fluid surrounding the animal, whereas the labyrinths, having very similar sensing mechanisms, are sensitive to endolymph, providing information concerning the animal's own equilibrium of the body and orientation in space ...|$|R
40|$|Multi-spacecraft {{interferometry}} imaging is {{an innovative}} concept intended to apply formations of satellites to obtain high resolution images {{allowing for the}} synthesis of a large size aperture through {{the combination of the}} signal from several sub-apertures. The design of such systems requires the design of trajectories that cover a specified region of the observation plane to obtain appropriate information to reconstruct an image of the source. A proposed configuration consists of <b>symmetrical</b> <b>formations</b> which use control thrust to actively follow spiral trajectories that would appropriately cover the specified regions. An optimization problem has to be solved to design the optimal trajectories with minimum fuel consumption. The present work introduces an algorithm to obtain near optimal maneuvers for multi-spacecraft interferometric imaging systems. Solutions to the optimization problem are obtained assuming the optimality of spiral coverage of the spatial frequency plane. The relationship between the error in the frequency content and the reliability of the image is studied to make a connection to the dynamics of the maneuver and define the parameters of the optimization problem. The solution to the problem under deep space dynamics is shown to be convex and is solved by discretization into a non-linear programing problem. Further, the problem is extended to include the effects of dynamical constraints and the effect of time varying relative position from the imaging system to the target. For the calculation of the optimal trajectories, a two-stage hierarchical controller is proposed that obtains acceleration requirements of near minimum fuel maneuvers for different target-system configurations. Several cases are simulated to apply the algorithm. From the obtained results some conclusions about the feasibility and dynamical requirements of these systems are described...|$|R
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The {{purpose of this}} study is to determine the relative affinity for electrons of the ethyl and propyl groups and thereby to check the indications of the ionization constants of certain acids and amines. The ionization constants of methyl, ethyl and propyl amines and acetic, propionic and butyric acids, indicate that the ethyl group has a smaller affinity for electrons than either the methyl or the propyl group. Lucas and Moyse have shown this to be true with respect to the methyl group and it is the intent of this work to investigate the evidence with respect to the propyl group. Two theories regarding the electronic character of carbon union have been proposed. The first is the alternate polarity theory which has been supported and worked on by Cuy. The second is the displacement theory which has been proposed by Lewis and has been used by Latimer and Rodebush in accounting for the ionization constants of some acids of phosphorus. The latter theory has also been worked on in this laboratory by Lucas and Jameson, Lucas, Simpson and Carter and Lucas and Moyse. According to the alternate polarity theory the carbon atoms in aliphatic chain tend to become arranged alternately positive and negative. Therefore, 3 -heptene (minus the hydrogen atoms) would appear to be: [ [...] . ]. As may be seen C- 3 is preponderantly negative while C- 4 is positive. Therefore, when a strong polar compound such as hydrogen bromide is added to this unsaturated hydrocarbon, the positive hydrogen will go to C- 3, while the bromine will go to C- 4. The theory consequently predicts the formation of 4 -bromo-heptane on the addition of hydrogen bromide to 3 -heptene. The ionization constant, K[subscript a] of propionic acid is [ [...] . ] and of butyric acid is [ [...] . ], while K[subscript b] of ethyl amine is [ [...] . ] and of proyl amine is [ [...] . ]. These values indicate that the propyl group has a greater affinity for electrons than the ethyl group. The validity of this apparent difference in affinity for electrons forms the basic assumption on which the displacement theory is based. This difference results in the displacement of the electronic orbits in the chain, which may be represented by a displacement of the average position of the electron pair. Therefore, 3 -heptene (minus the hydrogen atoms) would appear to be [ [...] . ]. Consideration of the preceding diagram indicates that C- 3 is essentially positive in comparison to C- 4. When hydrogen bromide is added to this hydrocarbon the theory predicts the formation of 3 -bromo-heptane. This is opposite to that predicted by the first theory. A factor which must be considered in dealing with this problem is that of symmetry of the molecule. Reference to innumerable organic compounds shows that the tendency towards this <b>symmetrical</b> <b>formation</b> is exceedingly great. In the addition of hydrogen bromide to 2 -pentene as well s to 3 -heptene, as mentioned above, the two theories predict different products. In the case of 2 -pentene, the symmetrical form is predicted by the displacement theory, and this isomer in the work of Lucas and Moyse was found to be formed in excess. However, in the case of 3 -heptene the unsymmetrical form is predicted. Therefore if the unsymmetrical form is produced in excess the evidence shows unquestionably the agreement of the electron affinities of the ethyl and propyl groups with the indications of the ionization constants. It also shows the factor of symmetry to be of minor importance compared to that of electron affinity. On the other hand, if the symmetrical form is produced in excess the evidence shows that the factor of symmetry is not of minor importance. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a three dimensional, generalized {{version of the}} original SPP model for collective motion. By extending the factors influencing the ordering, we investigate the case when {{the movement of the}} self-propelled particles (SPP-s) depends on both the velocity and the acceleration of the neighboring particles, instead of being determined solely by the former one. By changing the value of a weight parameter s determining the relative influence of the velocity and the acceleration terms, the system undergoes a kinetic phase transition as a function of a behavioral pattern. Below a critical value of s the system exhibits disordered motion, while above it the dynamics resembles that of the SPP model. We argue that in nature evolutionary processes can drive the strategy variable s towards the critical point, where information exchange between the units of a system is maximal. 1 Inroduction Collective motion of organisms (e. g. fish schools, bird flocks, bacterial colonies) exhibits a large variety of emergent phenomena [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

40|$|Repair- and recombination-defective {{mutations}} at two loci (mei- 9 and mei- 41) of Drosophila melanogaster {{have been}} examined for their effects on the induction of chromosome aberrations by x-rays {{and the formation of}} sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs). Irradiation of larval neuroblast cells during the S phase with x-rays showed that mutants at both of these loci are about 10 times more sensitive than wild type to the induction of chromosome aberrations. The pattern of induced aberrations was characteristic for each mutant locus: in cells bearing mei- 9 mutations most breaks were chromatid deletions, whereas in the presence of mei- 41 mutations similar frequencies of chromatid and isochromatid deletions were observed. Furthermore, chromatid interchanges could not be induced in cells carrying mei- 9 alleles; therefore these mutations define a step necessary for chromatid rejoining. mei- 41 alleles also define a function involved in the formation of chromatid interchanges; total exchanges were less frequent than expected from nonmutant controls; and the proportion of exchanges arising by symmetrical rejoining was markedly reduced. These data indicate that chromatid and isochromatid deletions have different molecular steps in their formation, and that different molecular mechanisms are also involved in the symmetrical and unsymmetrical rejoining in chromatid interchanges. Neuroblast cells of larvae bearing mei- 9 and mei- 41 alleles were also treated for 13 hr with 5 -bromodeoxyuridine at 9 mug/ml in order to differentiate sister chromatids for the scoring of SCEs. Whereas mei- 41 had a normal level of SCEs, mei- 9 exhibited a frequency of SCEs that was about 70 % that of the control. Because both mei- 9 and mei- 41 mutations result in defective meiotic recombination, these data suggest that they define steps shared by <b>symmetrical</b> interchange <b>formation</b> and meiotic recombination that do not participate in the formation of most SCEs...|$|R
40|$|Muscle {{development}} involves {{concerted action}} of {{a repertoire of}} mechanisms governing myoblast proliferation, migration, fusion and differentiation. Subsequently, there are cellular events administrating proper muscle function and maintenance of muscle integrity. Chapter 1 covers {{what is known about}} muscle development, building up of mass and maintenance in vertebrates and Drosophila, highlighting the myogenic programs and factors that play a role in them. The formation of vertebrate skeletal muscles can be recapitulated in Drosophila indirect flight muscles (IFMs), making IFMs an interesting model to dissect and understand the mechanisms of muscle development and maintenance. The cellular and developmental events that occur during IFM development have been discussed in detail along with their genetic control which encompasses both cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous mechanisms. The fly resources and tools used for experimentations have been described in Chapter 2. One of the hallmark events during muscle development is myoblast fusion. Myoblasts are kept in undifferentiated state until they fuse through a balanced action of anti-differentiation and pro-differentiation factors. The swarming myoblasts are in semi-differentiated state and just prior to fusion should exit cell cycle to achieve terminal differentiation. The mechanisms of cyclin/CDK complexes and their regulation via CKI (CDK inhibitor) are known in a cell. However, tissue specific factors exerting additional control on molecules that participate in cell cycle have been proposed but have not been shown in vivo. Chapter 3 uncovers a novel role played by the transcription factor, Erect wing (Ewg) in IFM development and patterning. Despite the fact that Ewg is known to express in fusing myoblasts and nuclei of developing IFMs and has long been used as a nuclear marker for IFMs, the mechanism(s) behind Ewg‟s function has remained enigmatic. Historical perspective of Ewg has been presented in Chapter 1. One set of IFMs; dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLMs) require larval templates for their formation and the other set; dorsal ventral muscles (DVMs) form de novo. Chapter 3 shows that Ewg is required in a spatio-temporal fashion to initiate myoblast fusion process. In the absence of Ewg, the number of fusion events in a given time is reduced. In addition de novo fusion is observed in the region of DLM development just like DVM and overall IFM development is delayed resulting in an aberrant adult IFM pattern. Genetic studies undertaken reveal a requirement for Ewg in exerting a temporal control on myoblast fusion. This is achieved by down-regulating Cyclin E levels, as a result of which the myoblasts exit cell cycle at G 1 /S stage. Through this study the proposal for DLM development and pattern has been put forth as follows: i) appropriate progression of DLM development commences on synchronous exit of myoblasts from cell cycle. This function is facilitated by Ewg expression in fusing myoblasts assisting <b>symmetrical</b> DLM <b>formation</b> in hemithoraces. ii) DLM pattern of six muscles in each hemithorax is dependent on template survival which requires fusion of enough myoblasts and further subsequent fusion events to support the splitting of three larval templates or presumptive DLM. The muscles that develop should preserve their structural integrity for efficient functional output. Muscles perform extensive activities warranting high energy requirements. IFMs are widely utilised for thorax movements that aid flight. IFMs are exclusively oxidative in nature with upto 40 % mass contributed by large mitochondria themselves. Chapter 4 describes yet another novel finding for Ewg function in IFM maintenance. Vertebrate homolog of Ewg is nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF 1) known for its role in mitochondrial biogenesis. This prompted an investigation on the role of Ewg, if any, in mitochondrial function and IFM maintenance. In this chapter, Ewg null adult IFMs are shown to undergo degeneration. Mitochondria in these muscles show rounder and smaller phenotype. Mitochondria morphology is traced throughout Drosophila pupal DLM development and extensive fusion is observed in last one-fourth of pupal phase. In Ewg null condition transcripts of Opa 1 -like required for inner mitochondrial membrane fusion is found to be absent, suggesting lack of mitochondrial fusion behind the smaller mitochondrial morphology. This emerged as an intriguing problem since Ewg expression follows until sarcomerogenesis (formation of sarcomeres) initiates at mid pupal stage. Developmentally extending Ewg‟s expression beyond mid pupal stage is not observed to increase Opa 1 -like levels pointing an indirect regulation by Ewg. However, Opa 1 -like knock-down beyond mid pupal stage is not observed to result in any muscle or flight defect. It is thus proposed that Ewg expression early during muscle development helps to up-regulate Opa 1 -like levels needed to support mitochondrial growth and fusion. In addition, this chapter provides additional data on requirement of Opa 1 -like for maintenance of mitochondrial as well as muscle integrity. This is the first ever report of tissue specific temporal regulation of Opa 1 -like by Ewg. Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 conclude spatially segregated functional requirements of Ewg which are also mechanistically distinct. Expression in fusing myoblasts channelizes fusing myoblasts to exit cell cycle and undergo timely fusion saving the larval template, subsequent fusion assists template splitting thus forming the appropriate adult DLM pattern. On the other hand expression until mid pupal stage up-regulates Opa 1 -like expression, facilitating mitochondrial fusion during the late pupal stage. This as a result helps maintain structural integrity of muscles in the adult. Vertebrate skeletal muscle contains multiple muscle fibres that provide appropriate mass and size to muscles. As DLM share similarity in development to that of the vertebrate skeletal muscle, DLM organisation is studied to get insights into the mechanisms which regulate the process. Chapter 5 discusses role of nuclear number and nuclear activity in determining the DLM organisation. In order to alter nuclear number, myoblast population is reduced to amounts lesser than that of the wild type and to alter nuclear activity, two nuclear encoded genes Opa 1 -like and Marf, involved in inner and outer mitochondrial membrane fusion respectively have been knocked down in IFMs. First, the DLM organisation is established by comparing it to the vertebrate skeletal muscle organisation. This organisation is affected on lowering the number of myoblasts destined to fuse and form IFMs, without affecting the differentiation. On the other hand, when nuclear encoded mitochondrial fusion genes are knocked down, not only DLM organisation but their differentiation is also affected. A proposal for achieving DLM organisation has been presented which should also apply to vertebrate skeletal muscle given their developmental similarity. In conclusion, the studies decipher a novel mechanism by which a transcription factor, Ewg exerts a temporal control on myoblast fusions directly influencing progression of DLM formation, and thereby, symmetry and pattern. Moreover, Ewg is also shown here to regulate mitochondrial fusion during later pupal stages helping muscles to attain greater function and maintain structural integrity. Discovery of such regulatory mechanisms controlling mitochondrial dynamics in vertebrates can open up new avenues to understand and design new therapeutic approaches to tackle mitochondrial diseases. Additionally, myoblast fusion and hence myonuclear number and their efficient functioning are shown to be important determinants of muscle organisation. This has further implications in understanding and using stem cell science in dystrophic or atrophic or ageing related muscle loss and therapy...|$|R
