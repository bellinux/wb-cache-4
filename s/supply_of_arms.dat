5|$|The British Expeditionary Force or BEF {{arrived in}} Calais {{on its way}} to the nearby {{frontline}} cutting through Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Flanders. Calais was a key port for the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> and reinforcements to the Western Front. In the 1930s, the town was known for being a politically socialist stronghold.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the battle, they were poorly armed and many were {{equipped}} only with hunting rifles. They relied mostly on light infantry weapons, but obtained a few artillery pieces and anti-aircraft guns and improvised their own land mines. They also obtained several hundred anti-tank weapons such as M79 and M80 rocket launchers, but were critically short of ammunition throughout the battle. The capture of JNA barracks somewhat improved the situation as Vukovar had the priority in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms.</b> It is estimated that the Vukovar battlefield consumed around 55–60 percent of all ammunition available to the Croatian forces.|$|E
5|$|In 1228 John Malemort, William the Smith and William the Fletcher {{arrived at}} the castle and began {{production}} operations at a forge built within the bailey. A production level of 120,000 quarrels in a 120-day period was achieved by 1233, with men like Malemort being able to produce up to 100quarrels a day. Quarrels were then put into barrels and shipped across the kingdom in large quantities. Other iron from the castle was sent to build siege engines in Hereford. The manufacturing capability of St Briavels Castle gave the king a distinct advantage over potential baronial enemies, with the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> from the castle to Marcher Lords threatened by the Welsh {{being one of the}} levers of royal power during the period.|$|E
50|$|Similarly {{military}} sanctions {{can range}} from carefully targeted military strikes to degrade a nation's conventional or non-conventional capabilities, to the less aggressive form <b>of</b> an <b>arms</b> embargo to cut off <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> or dual-use items.|$|R

5|$|In April 1942, the German Commanding General in Serbia, General der Artillerie (General) Paul Bader, issued orders giving unit numbers C39 to C101 to the Pećanac Chetnik detachments, {{which were}} put {{under the command}} of the local German {{division}} or area command post. These orders also required the deployment of a German liaison officer with all detachments engaged in operations, and limited their movement outside their assigned area. <b>Supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> and ammunition was also controlled. In July 1942, Mihailović arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to denounce Pećanac as a traitor. His continuing collaboration ruined what remained of the reputation he had developed in the Balkan Wars and World War I.|$|E
5|$|The {{security}} of the southern bands depended on French trade in arms, and this was disrupted by the French and Indian War (1754–63). In 1763, France surrendered the Louisiana Territory {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Fontainebleau. Great Britain obtained the portion of the territory east of the Mississippi River. Spain received the territory west of the Mississippi, including New Orleans, although they did not make their claim to that city effective until Governor Alejandro O'Reilly suppressed the Rebellion of 1768. Once in control of New Orleans, the Spanish imposed severe restrictions on trade up the Mississippi, cutting off the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> to the Southern Pawnees and Wichitas.|$|E
5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical {{leadership of the}} party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. The Khmer Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After {{the signing of the}} Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> to the Khmer Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn their air power completely on the Khmer Rouge, this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the army was hampered by the poor economy of the kingdom, and this continued through the 1920s. In 1929, King Alexander changed {{the name of the}} country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, at which time the army became the VKJ. The army budget remained tight, and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s, it became hard to secure weapons and munitions from other countries. At the time World War II broke out in September 1939, the VKJ had several serious weaknesses, which included reliance on draught animals for transport, and the large size of its formations. For example, infantry divisions had a wartime strength of 26,000–27,000 men, as compared to contemporary British infantry divisions of half that strength. These characteristics resulted in slow, unwieldy formations, and the inadequate <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower. Older generals better suited to the trench warfare of World War I were combined with an army that was not equipped or trained to resist the fast-moving combined arms approach used by the Germans in Poland and France.|$|E

50|$|The narrow nuclear-nonproliferation {{focus of}} the deal was criticized by the {{agreement}}'s opponents (such as Lawrence J.

25|$|In {{the midst}} of a naval blockade, the Confederacy {{received}} an almost steady <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> and other goods from Europe, along with mail.

25|$|Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence {{also played}} {{an active role}} during 1992–1995 and {{secretly}} supplied the Muslim fighters with arms, ammunition and guided anti tank missiles {{to give them a}} fighting chance against the Serbs. Pakistan defied the UN's ban on <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> to Bosnian Muslims and General Javed Nasir later claimed that Pakistan's intelligence agency, ISI, had airlifted anti-tank guided missiles to Bosnia which ultimately turned the tide in favour of Bosnian Muslims and forced the Serbs to lift the siege.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} the Military League’s demands were limited to an {{increased}} military budget, its reorganisation and modernisation, {{as well as the}} dismissal of the Princes from the Army. Although the Theotokis government had increased <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> and munitions, he had also reinstated Crown Prince Constantine, who had led the Army in the 1897 war, as Chief Inspector of the Army. Also, despite demands, he had authorised only a few officers to pursue further studies in France and Germany.|$|R

25|$|Constituency {{boundaries}} were reformed for the 1997 general election, and Lloyd {{was selected}} for the Manchester Central constituency, where he returned at each subsequent general election through to 2010. Following the 1997 general election which returned Tony Blair as Prime Minister, Lloyd was appointed a junior Minister of State in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office under Robin Cook, beginning 5 May 1997. In 1998, an inquiry by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee into the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> from Sandline International to Africa during the Sierra Leone Civil War led to accusations that Lloyd had been dishonest and lacked depth over the trade of illicit weaponry. Lloyd's position at the Foreign Office ended in a government reshuffle on 28 June 1999.|$|E

(The convention ending the revolt was signed on 21 March 1848.) He then marched to Veracruz, but Santa Anna took command of the troops. Puente Nacional was abandoned without a fight, and Santa Anna was decisively defeated at Cerro Gordo. The Mexicans abandoned a <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> at the castle of Perote, Veracruz. Canalizo abandoned the war, and refused to return to battle because of severe war strategy disagreements with Santa Anna, and thus took no part in the defense of Mexico City.|$|E
50|$|At first, the {{government}} was unable to control the occupation of land by the peasants. As a result, it could not enforce {{the provisions of the}} land reform decree to keep medium-sized productive estates intact. But the MNR eventually gained the support of the campesinos when the Ministry of Peasant Affairs was created and when peasants were organized into syndicates. Peasants were not only granted land but their militias also were given large <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms.</b> The peasants remained a powerful political force in Bolivia during all subsequent governments.|$|R
60|$|Temujin remodeled and reorganized {{the army}} {{on the same}} or similar principles. The men were divided into {{companies}} of about one hundred men each, and every ten of these companies was formed into a regiment, which, of course, contained about a thousand men. The regiments were formed into larger bodies of about ten thousand each. Officers were appointed, of all the various necessary grades, to command these troops, and arrangements were made for having <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> and ammunition provided and stored in magazines {{under the care of}} the officers, ready to be distributed to the men whenever they should require.|$|R

25|$|A {{standoff}} {{began as}} Huber had fled to his house. Austrian police had the area surrounded at 07:00 on 17 September. Hundred {{police officers were}} located to the scene and shots were sporadically fired by Huber, who was suspected of having stocked up a large <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> and ammunition there, as he owned several hunting weapons legally. It was also reported that children of Huber's might be at the location. Police sought {{to make contact with}} Huber, using his relatives to aid them. At 13:38, Austrian police requested the assistance of the Austrian army, which sent in three armored vehicles. As police moved closer to the house, they found the stolen police car at around 15:00, with the dead body of the kidnapped officer inside. At 17:30, Huber fired his last shot at police.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan sent UN Peacekeeping {{forces to}} the former Yugoslavia during the Yugoslav wars. During the war, Pakistan {{supported}} Bosnia while providing technical and military support. Approximately 90,000 Pakistani people went to Bosnia during the Yugoslav wars, accounting for 20% of the volunteer military force. The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) allegedly ran an active military intelligence program during the Bosnian War which started in 1992 lasting until 1995. The program distributed and coordinated the systematic <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> to various groups of Bosnian mujahideen during the war. The ISI Bosnian contingent was organized with financial assistance provided by Saudi Arabia, according to the British historian Mark Curtis. Despite the UN arms embargo in Bosnia, it was later alleged that the ISI airlifted anti-tank weapons and missiles to Bosnian mujahideen which turned the tide in favor of Bosnian Muslims and forced the Serbs to lift the genocidal siege of Sarajevo.|$|E
25|$|As {{the supply}} {{situation}} worsened for the Greeks, things improved for the Turks. After the Armistice of Mudros, the Allies had dissolved the Ottoman army, confiscated all Ottoman weapons (rifles, machine guns, artilleries, aeroplanes and warships) and ammunition, hence the Turkish National Movement {{which was in}} the progress of establishing a new army, was in desperate need of weapons. In addition to the weapons not yet confiscated by the Allies, they enjoyed Soviet support from abroad, in return for giving Batum to the Soviet Union. The Soviets also provided monetary aid to the Turkish National Movement, not {{to the extent that they}} promised but almost in sufficient amount to make up the large deficiencies in the promised <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms.</b> One of the main reasons for Soviet support was that Allied forces were fighting on Russian soil against the Bolshevik regime, therefore the Turkish opposition was much favored by Moscow. The Italians were embittered from their loss of the Smyrna mandate to the Greeks, and they used their base in Antalya to arm and train Turkish troops to assist the Kemalists against the Greeks.|$|E

50|$|In {{the initial}} {{phase of the}} war, the IDF was {{inferior}} in both numbers and armament. Invading Arab armies boasted 270 tanks, 150 field guns and 300 aircraft. The IDF had zero planes and three tanks. Due {{to a number of}} reasons, the Arabs never managed to exploit their superiority in numbers. The Israelis managed to successfully defend themselves in virtually all battlefields with the notable exception of East Jerusalem. After the first truce 11 June to 8 July, the Israelis managed to seize the initiative due to new troop enrollments and <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms.</b> Notable achievements <b>of</b> the IDF include the conquest of Eilat (Um Rashrash), Nazareth, and the capture of the Galilee and the Negev.|$|R
