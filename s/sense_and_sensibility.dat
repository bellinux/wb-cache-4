60|$|This {{progression}} from dynamic relationship towards a finished individuality and a finished mental concept {{is carried on}} from the four great primary centers through the correspondence medium of all the <b>senses</b> <b>and</b> <b>sensibilities.</b> First of all, the child knows the mother only through touch--perfect and immediate contact.

The child in the womb, perfect a contact though it may have with the mother, is all the time also dynamically polarized against this contact. From the first moment, this relation in touch has a dual polarity, and, no doubt, a dual mode. It is a fourfold interchange of consciousness, the moment the egg-cell has made its two spontaneous divisions.|$|R

2500|$|Tim Ingold, like Bird-David, {{argues that}} animists {{do not see}} {{themselves}} as separate from their environment: [...] "Hunter-gatherers do not, as a rule, approach their environment as an external world of nature {{that has to be}} 'grasped' intellectually... indeed the separation of mind and nature has no place in their thought and practice." [...] Willerslev extends the argument by noting that animists reject this Cartesian dualism, and that the animist self identifies with the world, [...] "feeling at once within and apart from it so that the two glide ceaselessly in and out of each other in a sealed circuit." [...] The animist hunter is thus aware of himself as a human hunter, but, through mimicry is able to assume the viewpoint, <b>senses,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sensibilities</b> of his prey, to be one with it. Shamanism, in this view, is an everyday attempt to influence spirits of ancestors and animals by mirroring their behaviours as the hunter does his prey.|$|R

5|$|Jane Austen lived {{her entire}} life {{as part of a}} large and close-knit family on the lower fringes of the English gentry. Her family's steadfast support was {{critical}} to Austen's development as a professional writer. Austen read draft versions of all of her novels to her family, receiving feedback and encouragement, and it was her father who sent out her first publication bid. Austen's artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about thirty-five. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried and then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. With the release of <b>Sense</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sensibility</b> (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{scholarly}} {{analysis has}} been conducted on Jane Austens characterization of Mr. Collins. Possibly the most thorough examination of this character was made by Ivor Morris in his book Mr Collins Considered: Approaches to Jane Austen. Morris says [...] "there is no one quite like Mr Collins ... his name has become a byword for a silliness all of his own—a felicitous blend of complacent self-approval and ceremonious servility." [...] He continues to say that Austen designed Mr. Collins as a flat character, yet {{he is one of}} her great accomplishments. Morris suggests that though Mr. Collins has few dimensions, he is just as rounded as <b>Sense</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sensibilitys</b> Edward Ferrars <b>and</b> Colonel Brandon, or Emmas Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith.In another analysis, Deirdre Le Faye wrote [...] "what does make Mr Collins a figure of fun and rightful mockery is his lack of <b>sense,</b> of taste, <b>and</b> of generosity of spirit contrasted to his own supreme unawareness of his shortcomings in these respects". [...] He has also been criticised for taking such a casual air of his own marriage, {{which is one of the}} primary concerns of the Church.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} current debate around family-school {{partnership}}s. Traditional family-school partnership theories do {{not account for the}} intended voices of Cambodian families. This article draws from existing research on Southeast Asian families more generally in order to develop a research-based, data-driven family-school partnership conceptual framework for Cambodian American families. It is believed that a pro-ethnic, voice-centric family-school partnership fosters an inclusive, supportive learning environment for Cambodian children. The logic undergirding that belief assumes that this partnership is likely to increase cultural awareness between critical home-school partners. At the very least, the proposed concept model serves as a theoretical building block upon which an empirical research study can be built. That study is encouraged to explore the implications of establishing a family-school partnership that reflects the <b>sense</b> <b>and</b> <b>sensibilities</b> of Cambodian families, particularly those stemming from lower income backgrounds. Implicit in the review is the premium placed on challenging Eurocentric, middle-class partnership paradigms to account for the authentic voices of ethnic minorities, and the utility of disaggregating data for Southeast Asians, given the array of cultural and linguistic differences spanning the Asian American community. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{brand is}} {{the soul of}} a business. Whether we are {{marketing}} a product or a service, brand value is significantly grounded on emotions that are activated through the five human senses. Studies have indicated that successful brand strategies convey meaningful experience to the five <b>senses</b> to elicit <b>and</b> trigger buying behaviours. Customers do not buy products and services per se, but they seek stories, engagement and meaningful experience that the product or service conveys. Brands that harness art, science and technology (AST) to delight the human emotions engender higher brand equity. This thesis studies the social and cultural meanings consumers attach to brands and branding within the art, science and technology continuum. The AST continuum combines and synergises the three disciplines to engender pleasurable feelings to stimulate brand connections for a product, service or brand. This <b>Senses</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sensibility</b> connection – enshrined in human feelings and responsiveness – is discussed, along with human behaviour, persuasive and emotional branding, globalisation and socialisation within social media. From here emerge key elements for a successful brand strategy to enable NZ SMEs to stay competitive in the shifting landscape of humanistic branding. The importance of the five human senses in human-centric branding is described in some detail. They are said to be our windows on the world, mediating it at both a physiological and cognitive level. Brand strategists are harnessing the web to engage customers’ emotions with their brands. However, although the internet has become an omnipresent channel for branding and customers seek high quality multi-sensory and multi-experiential brand interactions, designing for the five senses is largely forgotten when brand strategies are devised for this technological environment. In the globalised world where the five human <b>senses</b> <b>and</b> socialisation interact with social media, the challenges ahead are complex. To understand the problems and opportunities currently facing brand strategist, the thesis draws upon discourse to understand past and present approaches to branding. It contextualises relationships and connections between conscious and unconscious behaviour, emotion, sensation, motivation, desire, perception, identity and consumption. Some business models are reviewed to help frame these emotional experience touch-points that build customer loyalty for brands, and ultimately brand equity for business. For <b>Senses</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sensibility</b> to be of value, the study sought interpretations from a series of focus groups and subjective assessments. Through this process, the research moved towards hermeneutic phenomenology in seeking meaning through linguistic descriptions of participants’ emotional experience in relationship to their five <b>senses</b> <b>and</b> the social media context. A large amount of information from the research process was generated, analysed and synthesised through data visualisation, graphic representation and information design. This creative work constitutes an important and original practice-based aspect of the thesis. Conclusions suggest that this strategic approach is valuable to business, since it considers the emotional and subjective capabilities of the customer. As a business approach, it is characterised by a personal relationship between all stakeholders in keeping with contemporary values...|$|R

40|$|Vampires, werewolves, witches and elves {{are popular}} {{characters}} in fantasy fiction across media. Such nonhuman protagonists and villains are often read as allegorical representations of human identity categories, of our struggles to explore, understand and assert (or potentially complicate) notions of difference and the heterogeneous societies {{in which we}} live. Yet, at the literal level, such characters are explicitly not human so that their drives, motivations, <b>senses</b> <b>and</b> <b>sensibilities</b> are framed as distinct from those of their human counterparts, even meant {{to be seen as}} incomprehensible in human terms.
