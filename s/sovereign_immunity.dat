5|$|The third case, Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Washington (Puyallup III), {{was decided}} in 1977. Members of the Puyallup Tribe filed suit, arguing {{that under the}} {{doctrine}} of <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity,</b> Washington state courts lacked jurisdiction to regulate fishing activities on tribal reservations. Writing {{for a majority of}} the Court, Justice John Paul Stevens held that, despite the tribe's <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity,</b> the state could regulate the harvest of steelhead trout in the portion of the river that ran through the Puyallup Reservation as long as the state could base its decision and apportionment on conservation grounds.|$|E

5|$|Scalia took a broad {{view of the}} Eleventh Amendment, which bars certain {{lawsuits}} against states in the federal courts. In his 1989 dissent in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., Scalia stated {{that there was no}} intent {{on the part of the}} framers to have the states surrender any <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> and that the case that provoked the Eleventh Amendment, Chisholm v. Georgia, came as a surprise to them. Professor Ralph Rossum, who wrote a survey of Scalia's constitutional views, suggests that the justice's view of the Eleventh Amendment was actually contradictory to the language of the Amendment.|$|E

5|$|Families of 45 of the 47 {{passengers}} sued Comair for negligence. (Families of {{the other}} two victims settled with the airline before filing litigation.) Three sample cases were due to be heard on August 4, 2008; but the trial was indefinitely postponed after Comair reached a settlement with the majority of the families. Cases brought by Comair against the airport authority and the FAA, arguing each should share in the compensation payments, are now resolved. The case against the airport authority was dismissed on <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> grounds, and this ruling was upheld by the Kentucky Supreme Court on October 1, 2009. In Comair's case against the United States, a settlement was reached with the United States agreeing to pay 22% of the liability for the crash, while Comair agreed to pay the remaining 78%.|$|E
5|$|Gellers was {{representing}} the Passamaquoddy pursuant to a 10% contingency fee agreement. Gellers, in turn, had assigned 40% of his fee to Bottomly. As the negotiations of the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act were reaching a close in May 1978, even though neither Gellers nor Bottomly had performed any further {{work for the}} tribes, Bottomly filed suit in the District of Maine claiming he was entitled to a portion of any eventual settlement. On October 10, Judge Gignoux dismissed Bottomly's suit {{on the grounds of}} tribal <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity.</b> When Bottomly's appeal came before the First Circuit in 1979, Maine filed an amicus brief arguing that the tribe was entitled to no such immunity. The First Circuit rejected this argument. A similar suit by Gellerswho had since been disbarred and changed his name to Tuvia Ben Shmuel Yosefwas thrown out in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Several legal {{developments}} {{occurred on}} the eve of the settlement. First, the First Circuit held in Bottomly v. Passamaquoddy Tribe (1979) that the Passamaquoddy were entitled to tribal <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> (see supra). Second, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court held in State v. Dana (1979) that the state had no jurisdiction to punish on-reservation arson because of the federal Major Crimes Act. Third, in Wilson v. Omaha Indian Tribe (1979), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the provision of the Nonintercourse Act placing the burden of proof in land claims on non-Indians did not apply to U.S. state defendants (but did apply to corporate defendants); further, language in Wilson threatened to confine the applicability of the Act to Indian country. The tribes persuaded the U.S. Solicitor General to file a motion asking the Court to delete that language from its opinion. The Court denied the motion. Maine unsuccessfully sought certiorari in Dana on the basis of Wilson.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} also rejected Justice Marshall's {{suggestion that}} plaintiffs could recover under {{the civil rights}} statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, noting that nothing in that statute suggested that Congress had intended to abrogate state <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> through its passage. Finally, the Court {{found that it was}} not improper to consider the state <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> issue even though the state had not raised it in the trial court, because the state <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> is a jurisdictional bar, which may be raised at any time.|$|E

25|$|The MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians in Alabama and the Alabama Inter-Tribal Council, {{which is}} {{composed}} solely of non-federally recognized tribes under Chief Framon Weaver, obtained a US Supreme Court ruling that <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> applies {{not only to}} entities such as the Alabama Inter-Tribal Council as {{an arm of the}} tribe, but also that <b>sovereign</b> <b>immunity</b> is inherent and possessed of Indians because they are Indians.
