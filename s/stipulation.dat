40|$|Performance {{contractors}} (PC) {{often use}} <b>stipulations</b> for part {{or all of}} their measurement & verification (M&V) efforts. The value of <b>stipulations</b> are low cost and easy implementation (good). Disadvantages include uncertain savings estimates (bad) and potential for disputes and lawsuits (ugly). PCs and customers sometimes misuse or abuse <b>stipulations</b> either by stipulating the savings directly or stipulating parameters based on limited or unreliable information. The purpose of M&V is to provide assurance that project savings exist. Improper and excessive reliance on <b>stipulations</b> may effectively nullify savings guarantees and also miss opportunities to assure measure performance by using verification data for feedback. A review of PCs in the federal sector shows significant reliance on stipulations; private-sector PCs are presumed similar. Recognized M&V guidelines such as ASHRAE 14 -P, IPMVP, and FEMP discuss the use of <b>stipulations.</b> Recent changes to the IPMVP and FEMP guidelines resulted in diverging attitudes towards <b>stipulations</b> with the IPMVP now requiring some measurements. In response, FEMP is developing guidelines for using <b>stipulations</b> in federal-sector performance contracts {{that can be applied}} to privatesector PCs as well. Proper use of <b>stipulations</b> requires balancing costs with savings uncertainty...|$|R
