5|$|The Laws of the Game specify {{that all}} players, {{regardless}} of gender, must {{wear the same}} kit, however in September 2008 the Dutch women's team FC de Rakt made international headlines by swapping its old strip {{for a new one}} featuring short <b>skirts</b> <b>and</b> tight-fitting shirts. This innovation, which had been requested by the team itself, was initially vetoed by the KNVB, Dutch football's governing body, but this decision was reversed when it was revealed that the FC de Rakt team were wearing hot pants under their <b>skirts,</b> <b>and</b> were therefore technically in compliance.|$|E

5|$|Women wore long dresses, blouses {{that came}} down to the knee, <b>skirts</b> <b>and</b> jackets with long or short sleeves, while women from wealthy {{families}} could wear purple scarves around their shoulders. The main difference in women's apparel from that of men was that it was fastened on the left, not on the right.|$|E
5|$|A {{few hours}} later, the Zimbabwean players {{returned}} to the field wearing their blue <b>skirts</b> <b>and</b> blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} Black Watch Tartan of {{the college}} was introduced in 1918. Senior girls wore heavy box-pleated <b>skirts</b> <b>and</b> white blouses; junior girls wore pinafore dresses. All girls wore a navy blazer and heavy woollen stockings. Prefects also wore a special hat badge with a ring of bright blue enamel. A black felt Breton was introduced for winter use, and no change was made until {{the introduction of the}} green beret in 1952.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of large trim and heel angles of the wrecked submarine, the double spherical shell {{rotating}} docking skirt is studied. According to the working principle of the rotating docking <b>skirt,</b> <b>and</b> the fixed <b>skirt,</b> the directional skirt, the angle skirt are simplified as the connecting rod. Therefore, the posture equation and kinematics model of the docking <b>skirt</b> are deduced, <b>and</b> according to the kinematics model, the angle of rotation of the directional <b>skirt</b> <b>and</b> the angle <b>skirt</b> is obtained when the wrecked submarine is in different trim and heel angles. Through the directional <b>skirt</b> <b>and</b> angle <b>skirt</b> with the matching rotation can make docking skirt interface in the 0 °~ 2 γ range within the rotation, to complete the docking <b>skirt</b> <b>and</b> the wrecked submarine docking. The MATLAB software is used to visualize the rotation angle of fixed <b>skirt</b> <b>and</b> directional <b>skirt,</b> which lays a good foundation for the development of the control of the double spherical shell rotating docking skirt in future...|$|R

5000|$|The 11 {{passenger}} CC2 {{was originally}} designed without a <b>skirt</b> <b>and</b> using air deflection within the cushion for propulsion.

5|$|After {{returning}} to Argentina from Europe, Evita never again appeared in public with the complicated hairdos of her movie star days. The brilliant gold color became more subdued in tone, {{and even the}} style changed, her hair being pulled back severely into a heavy braided chignon. Additionally, her extravagant clothing became more refined after the tour. No longer did she wear the elaborate hats and form-fitting dresses of Argentine designers. Soon she adopted simpler and more fashionable Paris couture and became particularly attached to the fashions of Christian Dior and the jewels of Cartier. In an attempt to cultivate a more serious political persona, Eva {{began to appear in}} public wearing conservative though stylish tailleurs (a business-like combination of <b>skirts</b> <b>and</b> jackets), which also were made by Dior and other Paris couture houses.|$|E
5|$|In some contexts, the {{traditional}} hooped crinoline {{may be seen}} as controversial, as in early 2015 when the University of Georgia reportedly requested hoop skirts not be worn to certain fraternity events due to their perceived association with Southern Belles and the slave-owning, upper socioeconomic classes of the American Deep South. The reason for the proposed ban was linked to the SAE racism incident earlier that year, with several articles noting it was a well-intentioned attempt to avoid the University of Georgia fraternities facing charges of racial insensitivity. It was noted that hoop <b>skirts</b> <b>and</b> crinolines had been worn by both black and white women of all classes and social standings during the historical period in question, and that despite popular associations, they were not exclusive to the image of the Southern Belle.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{just before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, there was {{a revival of the}} hooped crinoline from designers such as Edward Molyneux, who put hoops in both day <b>skirts</b> <b>and</b> evening gowns, and Norman Hartnell, whose late 1930s Winterhalter-inspired crinoline designs for Queen Elizabeth were so successful that the Queen is popularly (if inaccurately) credited with having single-handedly brought crinolines back into fashion. Both as Queen, and as the Queen Mother, Elizabeth adopted the traditional bell-shaped crinoline as her signature look for evening wear and state occasions. The film Gone With The Wind, released in 1939, inspired the American fashion for prom dresses with crinolines in Spring 1940.|$|E

5|$|Most middle {{aged and}} young women in urban Maharashtra dress in western outfits such as <b>skirts</b> <b>and</b> {{trousers}} or shalwar kameez with the traditionally nauvari or nine-yard sari, disappearing from the markets {{due to a lack}} of demand. Older women wear the five-yard sari. Traditionally, Brahmin women in Maharashtra, unlike those of other castes, did not cover their head with the end of their saree. In urban areas, the five-yard sari is worn by younger women for special occasions such as marriages and religious ceremonies. Maharashtrian brides prefer the very Maharashtrian saree – the Paithani – for their wedding day.|$|E
