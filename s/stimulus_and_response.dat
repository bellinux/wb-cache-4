Contrary to the behaviorist approach to focusing on <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> <b>response,</b> gestalt psychologists sought to understand the organization of cognitive processes (Carlson and Heth, 2010).

25|$|Kenneth Spence {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{well-known}} of Hull’s graduate students. He developed and extended Hull's neo-behaviorist theory into what came to be called the Hull-Spence theory of conditioning, learning, and motivation. This theory states that people learn stimulus-response associations when a <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> occur together, and reinforcement motivates the person to engage in the behavior and increases the occurrence of the learned behavior. Spence contributed to the study of incentive motivation and developing mathematical formulation and equations to describe learning acquisition. Spence attributed improvement in performance to motivational factors rather than the habit factors of Hull’s theory. He believed that reinforcement was not always necessary for learning to occur and that people can learn through latent learning. He also developed a discrimination learning theory. His discrimination theory suggests that there are gradients of excitatory and inhibitory potential that are generated around the values of the stimulus that are either reinforced or not.|$|E

5000|$|By 1960, {{psychology}} {{had come}} to be dominated by behaviorism and learning theory, which emphasized the observable <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> components of human and animal behavior while ignoring the cognitive processes that mediate the relationship between the <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> <b>response.</b> The cognitive phenomena occurring within the [...] "black box" [...] between <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> were of little interest to behaviorists, as their mathematical models worked without them. In 1960, the book Plans and the Structure of Behavior, authored by George A. Miller, Eugene Galanter, and Karl H. Pribram, was published. In this volume, Miller and his colleagues sought to unify the behaviorists' learning theory with a cognitive model of learned behavior. Whereas the behaviorists suggested that a simple reflex arc underlies the acquisition of the stimulus-response relationship, Miller and his colleagues proposed that [...] "some mediating organization of experience is necessary" [...] somewhere between the <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> <b>response,</b> in effect a cognitive process which must include monitoring devices that control the acquisition of the stimulus-response relationship. They named this fundamental unit of behavior the T.O.T.E.|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{dimensional}} {{overlap between}} <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> <b>responses</b> on partial response activation were investigated within a priming paradigm {{with the help}} of event-related potentials. The likely position of a target stimulus (requiring a left or a right reaction) was indicated by an arrow precue. To test whether automatic response activation processes are triggered by the cue, the lateralized readiness potential was computed. It was found that responses congruent to the direction of the cue were activated about 200 ms after cue onset. This early process was unaffected by specific cue-response contingencies and was completely missing when a nonspatial (color) cue was used. A second response activation phase was observed, which was partially controlled by specific <b>response</b> instructions <b>and</b> subjective expectancies. It is concluded that when <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> <b>responses</b> overlap with respect to spatial attributes, auto-matic response activation processes are triggered, which may later be replaced by the activation of an expected response. It is a well-known fact that the performance of partici-pants in an experimental task is influenced by the way that <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> <b>responses</b> are paired with each other.

[...] Reversal learning is assessed through the reversal learning task; a <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> relationship is learned through the trial and error method and then without notice, the relationship is reversed, examining the role of cognitive flexibility. Inhibited reversal learning can be associated with the idea that subjects experiencing symptoms of anxiety frustrate easily and are unable to successfully adapt to a changing environment. Thus, anxiety can negatively affect learning when the <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> relationship are reversed or altered.|$|E

40|$|Selecting {{responses}} in working memory while processing combinations of stimuli depends strongly on their relations stored in long-term memory. However, {{the learning of}} XOR-like combinations of <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> <b>responses</b> according to complex rules raises {{the issue of the}} non-linear separability of the responses within the space of stimuli. One proposed solution is to add neurons that perform a stage of non-linear processing between the <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> <b>responses,</b> at the cost of increasing the network size. Based on the non-linear integration of synaptic inputs within dendritic compartments, we propose here an inter-synaptic (IS) learning algorithm that determines the probability of potentiating/depressing each synapse {{as a function of the}} co-activity of the other synapses within the same dendrite. The IS learning is effective with random connectivity and without either a priori wiring or additional neurons. Our results show that IS learning generates efficacy values that are sufficient for the processing of XOR-like combinations, on the basis of the sole correlational structure of the <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> <b>responses.</b> We analyze the types of dendrites involved in terms of the number of synapses from pre-synaptic neurons coding for the <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> <b>responses.</b> The synaptic efficacy values obtained show that different dendrites specialize in the detection of different combinations of stimuli. The resulting behavior of the cortical network model is analyzed as a function of inter-synaptic vs. Hebbian learning. Combinatorial priming effects show that the retrospective activity of neurons coding for the stimuli trigger XOR-like combination-selective prospective activity of neurons coding for the expected response. The synergistic effects of inter-synaptic learning and of mixed-coding neurons are simulated. The results show that, although each mechanism is sufficient by itself, their combined effects improve the performance of the network...|$|R

[...] He hypothesized that pairing a <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> could result in learning after only one trial. Guthrie believed that learning takes place through association and conditioning, and one pairing is often enough to establish a connection, rather than repeated stimulus-response pairings.

The law of contiguity refers to associating, or learning, two stimuli or events that occur simultaneously. When the <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> occur together, they are learned due to the connection of their contiguity.|$|E
