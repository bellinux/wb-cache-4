It is an emblem carried by pilgrims {{on their way to}} the shrine of <b>Santiago</b> <b>de</b> <b>Compostela</b> in Galicia.

5|$|Ashbrook has {{compared}} the surviving autograph scores of L'ange de Nisida and La favorite to determine precisely how much material L'ange {{provided for the}} latter. While the events in L'ange are set in 1470 in Nisida and Naples, La favorite is set in <b>Santiago</b> <b>de</b> <b>Compostela</b> and Castile, both in Spain, prior to 1350. Donizetti made fundamental changes to {{the first half of}} La favorite and little remains of L'ange. The central conflict of the story involving the marriage and subsequent death is essentially the same from one opera to the other, and some of the character names are also similar or identical.|$|E
5|$|The chronicle also relates that Óláfr went to Rögnvaldr, who {{was also}} living in the Hebrides, and asked him for more land. Rögnvaldr's {{response}} was, according to the chronicle, to have Óláfr seized and sent to William I, King of Scots, who kept him imprisoned for almost seven years. The chronicle states that, on the seventh year, William died and that just before his death ordered the release of all his political prisoners. William {{is known to have}} died on 4 December 1214. The chronicle relates that upon gaining his freedom, Óláfr met with Rögnvaldr on Mann, and then set out on a pilgrimage with a significant number of noblemen. Óláfr's intended destination is considered to have been the shrine of St James at <b>Santiago</b> <b>de</b> <b>Compostela</b> in Spain.|$|E

50|$|In 1236, Córdoba was conquered by King Ferdinand III of Castile in the Reconquista, and {{the mosque}} was turned {{back into a}} church. Alfonso X oversaw the {{construction}} of the Villaviciosa Chapel and the Royal Chapel within the mosque. To commemorate the reconquest, a statue of Saint James Matamoros, seen trampling Moors, was added near the front of the Royal Chapel. The kings who followed added further Christian features, such as King Henry II rebuilding the chapel in the 14th century. The minaret of the mosque was also converted to the bell tower of the cathedral. It was adorned with <b>Santiago</b> <b>de</b> <b>Compostela’s</b> captured cathedral bells.|$|R
25|$|Undeterred, Guzmán {{continued}} the violent suppression on {{the peoples of}} the present-day states of Jalisco, Zacatecas, Nayarit and Sinaloa. In the latter state, he founded the city of San Miguel de Culiacán on September 29, 1531. He returned to Tepic, where he set up his headquarters, sending out new expeditions from there. One of these founded the cities of <b>Santiago</b> <b>de</b> Galicia <b>de</b> <b>Compostela</b> and Purificación. Another traveled as far as the current Mexican state of Sonora. His violent expeditions into Chichimec lands were a main cause of the Mixtón rebellion.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, some Galician and Asturian {{performers}} {{began to}} win fame within Spain {{and the international}} Celtic folk scene. Galician musicians of this period included Uxía, a singer originally with the band Na Lúa, whose 1995 album Estou vivindo no ceo and a subsequent collaboration with Sudanese singer Rasha, gained her an international following. The appearance of Fía na Roca, (that means [...] "Spin in the spinning wheel") was undoubtedly {{one of the key}} events of the Galician musical scene in the 90's. Fía na Roca was also the name of their debut album released in 1993. Its mixture of tradition and modernity led BBC to choose the music of this album as the soundtrack of the TV program that broadcast the Galician image to Europe in the 1993 Xacobeo Celebration (<b>Santiago</b> <b>de</b> <b>Compostela's</b> Holy Year).|$|R
5|$|Torres' {{parents are}} José Torres and Flori Sanz. He has two older siblings: Israel (born 1977) and María Paz (born 1976). He married Olalla Domínguez Liste on 27 May 2009 {{in a private}} {{ceremony}} with just two witnesses at the local town hall in El Escorial, Madrid. They had been a couple since 2001 and {{are thought to have}} met in the Galician seaside town of Estorde, Cee, where Torres would go on family holidays each year to escape the Spanish capital. The couple have two children, a daughter, Nora, born on 8 July 2009 at the Hospital La Rosaleda, in <b>Santiago</b> <b>de</b> <b>Compostela,</b> Galicia, and a son, Leo, born on 6 December 2010 at Liverpool Women's Hospital, with Torres missing the fixture against Aston Villa at Anfield.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} Óláfr, {{who had been}} given {{possession}} of Lewis, complained to Rögnvaldr that his lands were not enough. Rögnvaldr's response was seize Óláfr and send him to the King of Scots, where he was imprisoned for almost seven years. Upon his release, Óláfr undertook a pilgrimage to <b>Santiago</b> <b>de</b> <b>Compostela,</b> after which the half-brothers were reconciled and Rögnvaldr had Óláfr married to Lauon, the sister of his own wife. Sometime after 1217 this marriage was nullified by Reginald, Bishop of the Isles, {{who may have been}} an ally of Óláfr against Rögnvaldr. Óláfr then married Christina, a daughter of the King of Scots' protégé Ferchar, Earl of Ross. The chronicle claims that Rögnvaldr's bitter wife tricked their own son, Guðrøðr, into attempting to kill Óláfr; however, Óláfr narrowly escaped with his life and fled to the protection of his father-in-law on the mainland. Together with a loyal follower, one Páll Bálkason, Óláfr later defeated Guðrøðr on Skye.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} years, much of Hereford's {{focus was on}} reconquering his lost lands in the Marches, {{primarily}} through private warfare against Llywelyn. Henry III died in 1272, while his sonnow Edward Iwas crusading; Edward did not return until 1274. Llywelyn refused {{to pay homage to}} the new king, partly because of the military actions of Bohun and other Marcher lords, which Llywelyn saw as violations of the Treaty of Montgomery. On 12 November 1276, Hereford was present at a royal assembly where judgment was passed on Llewelyn, and in 1277, Edward I declared war on the Welsh prince. Rebellion in his own Brecon lands delayed Hereford's participation {{in the early days of}} the Welsh war. He managed, however, to both suppress the rebellion, and conquer lands further west. He then joined up with the royal army and served for a while in Anglesey, before returning to Brecon, where he received the surrender of certain Welsh lords. After the campaign was over, on 2 January 1278, he received protection from King Edward to go on pilgrimage to <b>Santiago</b> <b>de</b> <b>Compostela</b> in Spain.|$|E
5000|$|In 1522, Cristóbal de Olid {{was sent}} by Hernán Cortés {{northwest}} from Mexico City into Jalisco. [...] Other incursions were undertaken by Alonso de Avalos and Juan Alvarez Chico in 1521, Gonzalo de Sandoval in 1522, and Francisco Cortés de San Buenaventura in 1524. The first area explored now belongs {{to the south of}} Jalisco down into what it now the state of Colima. In 1529, the president of the First Audencia in New Spain, Nuño de Guzmán came west from Mexico City with a force of 300 Spanish and 6,000 Indian allies, traveling through Michoacán, Guanajuato, Jalisco and Sinaloa. At the end of 1531, Guzmán founded the Villa del Espíritu Santo de la Mayor Españas as the capital of the newly conquered western lands. The name was changed shortly thereafter to <b>Santiago</b> Galicia <b>de</b> <b>Compostela.</b> In 1531, Guzmán ordered his chief lieutenant, Juan de Oñate, to found the Villa of Guadalajara, named after Guzmán’s hometown in Spain. It was initially founded in what is now Nochistlán in Zacatecas. Construction began in 1532, but the small settlement came under repeated attacks from the Cazcanes, until it was abandoned in 1533. The town of Guadalajara would move four times in total before coming to its modern site in 1542.|$|R
