5|$|The Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell to {{join their}} {{exhibition}} basketball squad. Russell, who was sensitive to any racial prejudice, was enraged {{by the fact that}} owner Abe Saperstein would only discuss the matter with Woolpert. While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes. The USF center was livid after this snub and declined the offer: he reasoned that if Saperstein was too <b>smart</b> <b>to</b> speak with him, then he was too <b>smart</b> <b>to</b> play for Saperstein. Instead, Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft.|$|E
5|$|After A Song to David, {{he tried}} to publish a {{collection}} of his Psalms translations, and Newbery sought to ruin him by hiring James Merrick to produce his own translations. Newbery then hired Smart's new publisher, James Fletcher, which in turn forced <b>Smart</b> <b>to</b> find a new publisher, delaying the printing of his Psalms. Finally, on 12 August 1765, he printed A Translation of the Psalms of David, which included Hymns and Spiritual Songs and a second edition of A Song to David. This work was criticised by Tobias Smollett who was working with Newbery at the time, and Newbery's edition by Merrick was constantly compared with Smart's. However, modern criticism has received Smart's version in a more favourable light. While working on this project, he was also working on a translation of the Phaedrus and a verse translation of Horace. His verse Horace was published in July 1767 including a preface in which he attacked Newbery, but the attack was in vain because Newbery died soon after.|$|E

25|$|The 2010–2011 season {{may have}} begun with some renewed hope for a {{resurgence}} of Biedriņš, as 2009–2010 coach Don Nelson was fired and the potential existed for new head coach Keith <b>Smart</b> <b>to</b> unleash and reinvigorate the center's fragile confidence. Early returns were promising, as Biedriņš had several games in the early season with rebounding numbers at or around double-digits while averaging around thirty minutes per game, including 20 rebounds in a November 5 victory over the Utah Jazz, 28 points and 20 rebounds in a November 26 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, and 18 rebounds in a November 30 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. However, the injury bug bit again, derailing Biedriņš from mid-December 2010 to early January 2011, and once again he {{found it difficult to}} regain his previous form. Biedriņš' slumping play and persistent foul issues convinced <b>Smart</b> <b>to</b> bench him in favor of rookie Ekpe Udoh for four games in March. He was reinstated into the starting lineup for five games until spraining his ankle on March 16, resulting in his being sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season. Biedriņš' averages for the 2010–2011 season amounted to five points, 7.2 rebounds and 0.9 blocks (both a drop from 2009–2010) on 53.4% field goal shooting and a modestly improved 32.3% free throw percentage.|$|E

25|$|With {{over a week}} {{to prepare}} for their next game at home, the Bulldogs beat Baylor 94–87 on December 28. The team was unable to hold a lead until there was 4:53 {{remaining}} in the first half. At that point, the game went back and forth, and the Zags led {{by as many as}} 12. Pangos led the team with 31 points, while Olynyk and Harris added 21 and 17 points, respectively. Gonzaga then went back on the road to play at #22 Oklahoma State, where they got a 69–68 win. With 35.7 seconds left in the game, Mike Hart set a screen for Bell, who made a three-pointer to give the Zags the 67–65 lead. On the following play, Olynyk fouled out and sent Marcus <b>Smart</b> <b>to</b> the free throw line. Smart missed both free throws and Pangos rebounded the ball, and subsequently was sent to the free throw line, where he made both free throws. The win made Gonzaga undefeated against the Big 12 for the season with a 5–0 record.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} marks, are genomic {{regions with}} specific methylation pattern {{in a specific}} biological state such as tissue, cell type, individual), are regarded as possible functional regions involved in gene transcriptional regulation. Although various human cell types may have the same genome, these cells have different methylomes. The systematic identification and characterization of methylation marks across cell types are crucial to understanding the complex regulatory network for cell fate determination. Hongbo Liu et al. proposed an entropy-based framework termed <b>SMART</b> <b>to</b> integrate the whole genome bisulfite sequencing methylomes across 42 human tissues/cells and identified 757,887 genome segments. Nearly 75% of the segments showed uniform methylation across all cell types. From the remaining 25% of the segments, they identified cell type-specific hypo/hypermethylation marks that were specifically hypo/hypermethylated in a minority of cell types using a statistical approach and presented an atlas of the human methylation marks. Further analysis revealed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks were enriched through H3K27ac and transcription factor binding sites in cell type-specific manner. In particular, they observed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks {{are associated with the}} cell type-specific super-enhancers that drive the expression of cell identity genes. This framework provides a complementary, functional annotation of the human genome and helps to elucidate the critical features and functions of cell type-specific hypomethylation.|$|E

500|$|According to Mounsey, A Song to David and Smart's Psalms is {{an attempt}} to [...] "Christianize" [...] the Old Testament through writing an 18th-century psalter. However, the Psalms perform a {{secondary}} function: they allow <b>Smart</b> <b>to</b> relate to the suffering of David and to reinforce his own religious convictions by following his Biblical model. As part of Smart's [...] "Christianizing" [...] of the Psalms, Jesus becomes a divine form of suffering, and Smart becomes further juxtaposed with his Biblical model as both praise God for Jesus's ultimate sacrifice and for the beauty of all creation. The Hymns and Psalms form their own sort of liturgy and attempt to reform Anglican liturgy by emphasising God's place in nature.|$|E
500|$|The {{language}} and commentary on language {{is of particular}} emphasis in Jubilate Agno. To Alan Jacobs, Smart's use of language represents his attempt to connect to the [...] "Ur language", allowing <b>Smart</b> <b>to</b> connect to [...] "the Word calling forth the world." [...] This is similar to David and Orpheus's ability as poets to create through their song. In his constant emphasis on the force of poetry, Jubilate Agno takes on the qualities of the Ars Poetica tradition. As such, Smart is attempting to develop a poetic language that will connect him to the [...] "one true, eternal poem." [...] The poetic language that he creates is related to Adam's [...] "onomathetic" [...] tradition, or the idea that names hold significant weight in the universe and that Adam was able to join in with creation by naming objects.|$|E

500|$|Smart's role as Mrs. Midnight {{along with}} his gendered {{comments}} in Jubilate Agno form the focal point for analysing his understanding of sexuality and gender. With Mrs. Midnight, Smart challenges the traditional social order found in 18th-century England. However, some, like Lance Bertelsen, claim that the Mrs. Midnight persona reveals Smart's schizophrenia {{in which he is}} torn between masculine and feminine roles. Fraser Easton claims that the existence of Mrs. Midnight proves that Smart identified a female connection to poetry and her character was used to defy popular 18th-century notions of who is able to attain knowledge. This role allowed <b>Smart</b> <b>to</b> focus on [...] "social and sexual dimensions" [...] in his satire. However, there is a potentially darker side to Mrs. Midnight, and she could represent his feelings that he was [...] "emasculated by economic pressures." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics praised Nimoy's direction, {{to which}} USA Today {{attributed}} the film's success in capturing {{the essence of}} the television show.

Newsweek, and David Sterritt of the Christian Science Monitor, appreciated how the film slowed the action down to allow moments of reflection, comparing this with the focus of most contemporary action films on effects rather than actors. The Washington Posts Rita Kempley wrote that Nimoy's direction was competent, but his background in television showed—"the film feels made-for-TV", she summarized.
