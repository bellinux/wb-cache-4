40|$|We {{report a}} patient with {{congenital}} anomaly of cervical spine, who presented with clinical features suggestive of cervical compressive spondylotic myelopathy. He underwent C 3 median corpectomy, graft placement, and stabilization from C 2 to C 4 vertebral bodies. Postoperative period was uneventful and he improved in his symptoms. Eight years later, he presented with a difficulty in swallowing and occasional regurgitation of feeds of 2 months duration and oral extrusion of screw while having food. On oral examination, there was a defect in the posterior pharyngeal wall through which {{the upper end of}} plate with intact <b>self-locking</b> <b>screw</b> and socket of missed fixation screw was seen. This was confirmed on X-ray cervical spine. He underwent removal of the plate system and was fed through nasogastric tube and managed with appropriate antibiotics. This case is presented to report a very rare complication of anterior cervical plate fixation in the form of very late-onset dislodgement, migration of anterior cervical plate, and oral extrusion of screw through perforated posterior pharyngeal wall...|$|E
40|$|The {{solid rocket}} booster uses {{hydraulic}} pumps fabricated from cast C 355 aluminum alloy, with 17 - 4 PH stainless steel pump port caps. Corrosion-resistant steel, MS 51830 CA 204 L <b>self-locking</b> <b>screw</b> thread inserts are installed into C 355 pump housings, with A 286 stainless steel fasteners installed into the insert {{to secure the}} pump port cap to the housing. In the past, pump port cap fasteners were installed to a torque of 33 Nm (300 in-lb). However, the structural analyses used a significantly higher nut factor than indicated during tests conducted by Boeing Space Systems. When the torque values were reassessed using Boeing's nut factor, the fastener preload had a factor of safety of less than 1, with potential for overloading the joint. This paper describes how behavior was determined for a preloaded joint with a steel bolt threaded into steel inserts in aluminum parts. Finite element models were compared with test results. For all initial bolt preloads, bolt loads increased as external applied loads increased. For higher initial bolt preloads, less load was transferred into the bolt, due to external applied loading. Lower torque limits were established for pump port cap fasteners and additional limits were placed on insert axial deformation under operating conditions after seating the insert with an initial preload...|$|E

40|$|Fractures of the jaw {{are often}} treated with rigid and stable {{internal}} fixation using plates or miniplates. Early surgery for jaw fractures is the optimal treatment; however, if a late treatment is begun, often {{the adoption of}} other protocols is needed. When the jaw fracture has one free bone fragment with 2 full-thickness lesions of mucoperiosteal soft tissues both on the buccal and palatal sides, the risk of resorption or necrosis is very high after elevating a mucoperiosteal flap for rigid fixation. For this reason, we developed an intraoral epimucosal fixation technique using <b>self-locking</b> <b>screws</b> and plates. Substantial advantages of this new technique, in comparison with other commonly used fixation techniques, consisted {{in the prevention of}} bone resorption or necrosis by safe and simple screw insertion procedure after manipulation of the fracture for reduction in closed surgery. Major indications for epimucosal fixation in closed surgery are the presence of jaw fractures without dislocation or reducible jaw fractures by manipulation particularly in edentulous patients...|$|R

A new palatal distractor {{device for}} bodily {{movement}} of maxillary bones by rigid <b>self-locking</b> miniplates and <b>screws</b> system. Cortese A, Savastano M, Cantone A, Claudio PP. Source Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Salerno, Italy. Abstract METHODS: A new palatal distractor device for bodily {{movement of the}} maxillary bones after complete segmented Le Fort I osteotomy for 1 -stage transversal distraction and tridimensional repositioning on 1 patient is presented. The new distractor has an intrinsic tridimensional rigidity also in the fixation system by <b>self-locking</b> miniplates and <b>screws</b> for better control of the 2 maxillary fragments during distraction. RESULTS: Le Fort I distraction and repositioning procedure in association with a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy were performed on 1 patient with complete solution of the cross-bite and class III malocclusion. Results of dental and cephalometric analysis performed before surgery (T 1), after surgery and distraction time (T 2), and 18 months after surgery and orthodontic appliance removal (T 3) are reported. CONCLUSIONS: No complications were encountered using the new distractor device. Advantages of this device and technique are presented including improved rigidity of both distraction (jackscrew) and fixation (4 <b>self-locking</b> miniplates and <b>screws)</b> systems resulting in complete control {{of the position of}} the 2 maxillary fragments during distraction and surgery. In addition, this new device allows resuming palatal distraction in the event of cross-bite relapse without causing dental-related problems or the risks of screw slackening...|$|R

These plates allow many options in screw angulation enhancing the possibility of fracture fixation. This versatility allows for a stable osteosynthesis of highly comminuted or osteoporotic fractures.

40|$|Lead screw drives {{are used}} in various motion {{delivery}} systems ranging from manufacturing to high precision medical devices. Lead screws come in many different shapes and sizes; they may be big enough to move a 140 tons theatre stage or small enough {{to be used in}} a 10 ml liquid dispensing micro-pump. Disproportionate to the popularity of lead screws and their wide range of applications, very little {{attention has been paid to}} their dynamical behavior. Only a few works can be found in the literature that touch on the subject of lead screw dynamics and the instabilities caused by friction. The current work aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive study of lead screw dynamics focusing on the friction-induced instability in such systems. In this thesis, a number of mathematical models are developed for lead screw drive systems. Starting from the basic kinematic model of lead screw and nut, dynamic models are developed with varying number of degrees of freedom to reflect different components of a real lead screw drive from the rotary driver (motor) to the translating payload. In these models, velocity-dependent friction between meshing lead screw and nut threads constitute the main source nonlinearity. A practical case study is presented where friction-induced vibration in a lead screw drive is the cause of excessive audible noise. Using a complete dynamical model of this drive, a two-stage system parameter identification and fine-tuning method is developed to estimate parameters of the velocity-dependent coefficient of friction. In this approach the coupling stiffness and damping in the lead screw supports are also estimated. The numerical simulation results using the identified parameters show the applicability of the developed method in reproducing the actual systems behavior when compared with the measurements. The verified mathematical model is then used to study the role of various system parameters on the stability of the system and the amplitude of vibrations. These studies lead to possible design modifications that solve the systemâ€™s excessive noise problem. Friction can cause instability in a dynamical system through different mechanisms. In this work, the three mechanisms relevant to the lead screw systems are considered. These mechanisms are: 1. negative damping; 2. kinematic constraint, and; 3. mode coupling. The negative damping instability, which is caused by the negative gradient of friction with respect to sliding velocity, is studied thorough linear eigenvalue analysis of a 1 -DOF lead screw drive model. The first order averaging method is applied to this model to gain deeper insight into the role of velocity-dependent coefficient of friction and to analyze the stability of possible periodic solutions. This analysis also is extended to a 2 -DOF model. It is also shown that higher order averaging methods can be used to predict the amplitude of vibrations with improved accuracy. Unlike the negative damping instability mechanism, kinematic constraint and mode coupling instability mechanisms can affect a system even when the coefficient of friction is constant. Parametric conditions for these instability mechanisms are found through linear eigenvalue analysis. It is shown that kinematic constraint and mode coupling instability mechanisms can only occur in <b>self-locking</b> lead <b>screws.</b> The experimental case study presented in this work demonstrates the need for active vibration control when eliminating vibration by design fails or when it is not feasible. Using the sliding mode control method, two speed regulators are developed for 1 -DOF and 2 -DOF lead screw drive system models where torque generated by the motor is the controlled input. In these robust controllers, no knowledge of the actual value of any of the system parameters is required and only the upper and lower bounds of parameters are assumed to be available. Simulation results show the applicability and performance of these controllers. The current work provides a detailed treatment of the dynamics of lead screw drives and the topic of friction-induced vibration in such systems. The reported findings regarding the three instability mechanisms and the friction parameters identification approach can improve the design process of lead screw drives. Furthermore, the developed robust vibration controllers can be used to extend the applicability of lead screws to cases where persistent vibrations caused by negative damping cannot be eliminated by design modifications due to constraints...|$|R
