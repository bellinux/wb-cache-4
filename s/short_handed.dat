5|$|Prior to the Devils' {{training}} camp, Morrison {{was signed}} by the team to a multi-year contract on September 9, 1997. He {{was seen as an}} unlikely candidate to secure a roster spot with the Devils; ahead of Morrison on the depth chart were numerous centres, including Doug Gilmour, Bobby Holík and Petr Sýkora. As such, he played the majority of the 1997–98 season in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Devils' minor league affiliate, the Albany River Rats. He scored 35 goals and 84 points over 72 games in the AHL, ranking first in team scoring and eighth in the League overall. He finished second among League rookies in scoring, eight points behind Daniel Brière of the Springfield Falcons, and was named to the AHL All-Rookie Team. His AHL season included a five-goal game against the Hartford Wolfpack on April 1, 1998; two of his goals came <b>short</b> <b>handed</b> into an empty net, as part of a 5–2 Albany win.

After struggling to score {{in the first half of}} the 2005–06 season (he recorded nine points in the first three months), Booth finished with 35 points (13 goals and 22 assists) over 37 games. His strong offensive production in the second half included an 11-game point-scoring streak that was broken on the last regular season game against the Miami RedHawks. In the 2006 CCHA playoffs, Booth helped the Spartans to a Mason Cup as league champions. Facing the Miami RedHawks in the final, Booth scored the game-winning goal six minutes in the second period, securing a 2–1 win for Michigan State. Moving on to the 2006 NCAA Tournament, they were eliminated in the regional final by the Maine Black Bears 5–4. Booth scored a goal and an assist in the losing effort. Over four years with the Spartans, Booth finished his college career with 105 points in 134 games.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell {{began the}} season on a {{defensive}} pairing with Drew Doughty. Nearly a month into the campaign, he notched his first goal as a King, scoring <b>short</b> <b>handed</b> against the Dallas Stars in a 5–2 victory on October 28, 2010. In November 2010, he sustained a wrist injury {{during a game}} against the Nashville Predators, sidelining him for 12 games. After recovering, he suffered a knee injury, keeping him from another 11 games. Later in the season, during {{a game against the}} Phoenix Coyotes, on March 3, 2011, Mitchell was hit in the face by a shot from opposing forward Kyle Turris, requiring 53 stitches. He did not miss any additional games, however. Mitchell finished the season with five goals and five assists over 57 games, ranking third in average ice time per contest with the Kings. He added a goal and an assist in six playoff games as the Kings were eliminated by the San Jose Sharks in the first round.

25|$|When {{a player}} commits a foul, {{or when the}} ball is deemed unplayable, play is resumed from a free-hit or a face-off. A free hit {{involves}} a player from one team to start play from {{the place where the}} ball was last deemed unplayable. A comparison of this is a free kick in soccer. For many fouls, such as stick infractions, a free hit is the only discipline provided. However, at the referee's discretion, a penalty may be worth either two or five minutes. At that point, the player who committed the foul sits in the penalty area, and his team is <b>short</b> <b>handed</b> for the time of the penalty. If an 'extreme' foul is committed, such as physical contact or unsportsmanlike behavior, a player may receive a 10-minute penalty or even a match misconduct.|$|E

Limited to 55 games, he recorded 14 goals and 37 points, the lowest totals of his career since the 1998–99 season.
