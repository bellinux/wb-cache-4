40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} the detailed operations of a three-phase dual active bridge bidirectional zero-voltage switching (ZVS) DC/DC converter (TPDAB) which transfers a bidirectional power flow between a 12 V net {{and a high}} voltage DC net. The converter is controlled by phase-shift-modulation (PSM) with a fixed duty cycle D= 1 / 3. It features isolation, <b>smoother</b> <b>drawing</b> and injecting current from the 12 V net, smaller capacitances, smaller switch current stress, ZVS over a wide range, high efficiency and a large power handling capability. The mathematic model is analyzed. The soft-switching principle is described and its ZVS criterias are derived.

In this paper, we focus on perfect smooth orthogonal drawings in which each edge is made of either a rectilinear segment or a circular arc. We prove that every 3 -planar graph admits a planar perfect <b>smooth</b> orthogonal <b>drawing.</b> If we relax planarity constraints, we show that every graph of maximum degree 4 admits a (non-planar) perfect <b>smooth</b> orthogonal <b>drawing.</b> We demonstrate that there exist infinitely many planar graphs that do not admit planar perfect smooth orthogonal drawings under the Kandinsky model.

The proposed topology consists of a flyback DC-AC inverter and a DC active filter that can operate independently. The flyback inverter, controlled in digital peak current mode, regulates the full-wave rectified sinusoidal current later, which is alternately inverted and injected into the grid. The DC active filter regulates the <b>smooth</b> current/power <b>drawn</b> from a PV module by using cascaded proportional-integral (PI) controllers. Analysis, design {{and control of the}} proposed topology are presented. A 100 W/ 220 V/ 50 Hz prototype is developed and tested. The experimental results show that the proposed flyback inverter with a DC active filter is capable of regulating a sinusoidal current fed into the grid, actively filtering the DC current/power and achieving reasonably high energy conversion efficiency...|$|R

To improve the approximation efficiency of experimental data, it was suggested to use complex criteria, including minimizing the mean square error of approximation while using conditions of smoothness of an approximating curve based on the analysis of second derivatives. The suggested approach was compared with the method of moving average, which was widely used for smoothing processes under conditions of a priori uncertainty. The proposed methods were used to smooth the monitoring data of the blood pressure. It was shown that the optimal smoothed dependencies ensure sufficient smoothness to highlight short-term fluctuations in the average blood pressure, in order to identify the persistent patterns of their dynamics, which was important for predicting the human health state. ????? ????????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????, ?????????? ????????? ?????????????? ???????? ??????, ?? ???? ????????, ???????? ????? ???????, ??????? ??????, ??????? ?????? ???? ??????????? ??????? ? ????????????????? ??????. ??? ????????? ????????????? ????????????? ????????????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ????????, ?????????? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ?????? ????????????? ??? ?????????? ??????? ????????? ???????????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ?? ?????? ???????????. ???????? ????????????? ?????? ????????????? ??????? ? ??????? ??????????? ????????, ?????? ???????????? ??? ??????????? ????????? ? ???????? ????????? ????????????????. ???????????? ???????? ????????? ??? ??????????? ?????? ??????????? ????????????? ????????. ????????, ??? ??????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????, ????? ???????? ????????????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ????????, ??????? ?????????? ?????????????? ?? ????????, ??? ????? ?????? ???????? ??? ??????????????? ??????????????? ????????? ????????...|$|R
