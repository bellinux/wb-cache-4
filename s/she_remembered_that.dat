500|$|By 1570, senior {{figures in}} the {{government}} privately accepted that Elizabeth would never marry or name a successor. William Cecil was already seeking solutions to the succession problem. For her failure to marry, Elizabeth was often accused of irresponsibility. Her silence, however, strengthened her own political security: she knew that if she named an heir, her throne would be vulnerable to a coup; <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> the way [...] "a second person, as I have been" [...] had been used {{as the focus of}} plots against her predecessor.|$|E

500|$|Dunn {{then moved}} {{onto the scene}} during the funeral, when the child trembled from seeing her mother's lips sewn shut. Described by her {{as one of the}} most troubling shots in {{mainstream}} music videos, the scene was inspired by Madonna's memory of her mother lying in her wake. The singer recalled in a 1991 interview with Vanity Fair, that <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> her mother's lips looked funny in the funeral. When she got closer, she saw that Madonna Sr's lips had been sewn together. This image of her mother had haunted Madonna for many years, and led her to comment that she never could resolve her Electra complex. The singer further explained: ...|$|E

500|$|Salinger also {{insisted that}} Claire {{drop out of}} school and live with him, only four months shy of graduation, which she did. Certain {{elements}} of the story [...] "Franny", published in January 1955, are based on his relationship with Claire, including her ownership of the book The Way of the Pilgrim. Because of their isolated location and Salinger's proclivities, they hardly saw other people for long stretches of time. Claire was also frustrated by Salinger's ever-changing religious beliefs. Though she committed herself to Kriya yoga, <b>she</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> Salinger would chronically leave Cornish to work on a story [...] "for several weeks only to return with the piece {{he was supposed to be}} finishing all undone or destroyed and some new 'ism' we had to follow." [...] Claire believed [...] "it was to cover the fact that Jerry had just destroyed or junked or couldn't face the quality of, or couldn't face publishing, what he had created." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{her father}} was jailed for 18 months after being convicted of fraud, she left home with her sister {{to live with her}} mother and partner (Crossroads actor Charles Stapley), in Clapham, London. Her brother went to Brighton to live with his {{paternal}} grandparents. She later wrote that at the age of 15 she ran away to join a funfair, and lived in a cardboard box under Waterloo station for four months, although Stapley denied this by saying that she occasionally left home at weekends to travel with a young man who worked for a funfair in London. During her stated period of homelessness, her school records indicate that she and her sister were both enrolled at Usworth comprehensive in Tyne and Wear until April 1983, and at Hydeburn Comprehensive, in Balham, on 6 June 1983, where they both stayed until 2 July 1984. <b>She</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> a teacher at the Hydeburn once said, [...] "there's no hope for her at all", and that she left school with no academic qualifications. In the same year, her father had another daughter, Claire Mills, with a new partner. Mills worked for a croissant shop, but was sacked, and vowed [...] "never to work for anyone else again". She later wrote in her autobiography that the owner of a jewellery shop in Clapham gave her a job on Saturdays, but Jim Guy, the owner of Penrose Jewellers, later stated: [...] "Everything she wrote about me was lies, I never gave her a job; she just hung around and made tea. She told me {{her father was}} dead. The only thing that was true was she nicked stuff from the shop", which Guy said was worth £20,000. She admitted that she had stolen some gold chains and sold them to buy a moped, and when Guy reported the theft, she was put on probation.|$|E

However, the next day, Price did not answer her door and Rogers was gone.
