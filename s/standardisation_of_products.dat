40|$|Institutionalists {{argue that}} the {{successful}} transfer of knowledge depends on a firm's ability to adapt to its local environments. Jensen and Szulanski (2004) take a different perspective, focusing on global integration. While both approaches have received considerable attention their relationship has been less discussed. Using an extended case study method exploring 15 Austrian MNCs, we propose {{that there are two}} models to explain the relationship. One model puts local adaptation and global integration at two ends of a continuum. According to this interpretation there is a trade-off between the two. A second model sees local adaptation and global integration in an orthogonal relationship. They do not exclude each other but can be achieved at the same time by emphasising different aspects of an organisational practice. The Austrian MNCs we explore have a tendency towards the second model. They combine strong personal relationships with <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> and processes, using training as a link between them...|$|E
40|$|Magister Commercii - MComProduct {{innovation}} and its efficient diffusion {{are important to}} enhance factor productivity, market access, job creation and trade. Innovative firms remain competitive in an increasingly global environment. Product innovation add maximum economic value when the new knowledge and technical know-how are spread through the economy. <b>Standardisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> {{is regarded as a}} vital tool to enable the diffusion of product innovations. The economic rationale for standardisation is based on the theory market failure that requires some sort of correction. Standardisation is regarded as a public good, a form of technical infrastructure. It reduces transaction costs and information asymmetries; increased the willingness of consumers to pay, which in turn increases the success and diffusion of innovation. Lower transaction costs result in reduced production and distribution costs. For consumers it also results in reduced search and testing costs as well as reduced time and effort to evaluate quality. Studies on the impact of standardisation were done for some developed countries, but not for developing countries. Unlike most studies that have a narrow industry-focus, this report has a broader focus on the impact of various types of standards on product innovation, market access and trade. It presented specific case studies for various industries in South Africa as well as studies on the impact of standards internationally. South Afric...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} that a cartel is not necessarily synonymous with a brake on innovation but that, on the contrary, it may become the site of information transfer and technology exchange. The example chosen is the cable industry. Research was based on the archives of two Swiss cable manufacturers and on those of a Swiss and an international cartel (International Cable Development Corporation) from the beginning of the twentieth century until the 1970 s. The cartels studied, which were primarily based on territorial and price protection, fostered various forms of information and technology transfers: exchange of information in order to rationalise production, know-how sharing, transfers or sales of patents or licences, <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> to ensure compatibility between products from various companies. Finally, one of the cartels studied became a key player in Research and Development (R&D) by creating test structures and R&D laboratories and controlling market introduction of innovating products. The historiography of the last 30 years had a tendency to consider cartels as an exception, however, as Jeffrey Fear wrote 'Yet, until the 1980 s, the global story of big business must be told in conjunction with cartels rather than without them' (Fear, October 2006). The {{purpose of this}} paper is to once again look at one aspect of the cartels' impact on the innovation. cartels, innovation, R&D, competition, Swiss cable firms, cartel question,...|$|E

It investigates the volume and value of vegetable losses upstream along the supply chain, and identifies the main reasons and the preventive measures undertaken at each stage in the supply chain to abate postharvest losses. Loss estimates are compared by supply chain actor, country and crop. This study finds that the average loss of the selected vegetables is about 17 %, and that farmers are the most vulnerable group compared to middlemen and retailers who both have more control on product prices. It recommends developing measures to contain disease problems for farmers, and improving marketing efficiency through <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> quality for middlemen and retailers.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse what rhetoric of {{responsibility}} Swedish corporations presents and the structural determinants fur such presentations. 	Corporate identity is the managerial use of rhetoric and other symbolical means to (re) present the corporation’s values, self-understanding and the interpretations made of the world. 	A returning element in this rhetoric is the idea of responsibility, as in Corporate Social Responsibility. A number of corporations have chosen to explicitly or implicitly include normative aspects in their rhetoric of responsibility. In this study the analyses rests on theories on reflexive modernity and the structural transformation of social orders driven by the implosion of modernity’s dualisms, the increasing threats to organizational operations caused by factual risks or the fear for assumed risks, the medialisation of politics and business, the globalisation of economy, politics and everyday life, the increasing competition and <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> and services and the individualisation of opinions and values often expressed in the realm of sub-politics. 	The empirical study includes all corporations listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange 2004 and content analysis is used to categorise the voluntary sections of the annual reports and the sustainability report if available. 	The results show that economy is the predominate area of responsibility included in corporate rhetoric. A smaller group consisting of large, well known corporations diverges from this by giving ethical aspects greater importance. Two structural dimensions are of greater importance to understand the different strategies; visibility and risks. The more visible the corporation is and the more risks the corporation produces the more ethics it includes in its rhetoric. Based on the results the study also raises questions about the validity in corporations’ statements on ethical responsibilit...|$|E

Further it defines the concept of eco-efficiency, and describes ways of developing eco-efficiency indicators for production sites and for product chains. Eco-efficiency measures give indications both on economic and on environmental performance. These indicators are then exemplified by results from case studies within Norwegian and European industrial companies. Some of these projects have {{laid the foundation for}} environmental accounting and reporting systems also in local communities. Eco-efficiency as a tool for measuring the performance along product value chains is demonstrated in the paper.

Given that each of these local authorities is part of a larger, national network infrastructure, we recommend that a large-scale security policy be considered to ensure uniformity and compliance across all of the local authorities. The findings of our investigation act as foundations for forming a cohesive policy and indicate areas of current common practice which may lead forward future developments. The investigation highlights opportunities for Welsh local authorities to enhance the ICT security service, particularly in the areas of: plans for dealing with security issues, <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> security <b>products</b> and policies, adequate security training for ICT support staff and measures for reporting security incidents...|$|R

We examine the notion <b>of</b> <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> components in <b>product</b> design by formulating a component selection model for the purpose of profit maximisation. The mathematical model proposed in this paper falls under the category of non-linear integer programming, and takes into account revenue, production and inventory costs. Our parametric analysis of a case example concludes that full commonality <b>of</b> components among <b>products</b> does not always maximise profit; furthermore, the optimal solution space is bounded by the minimal-component/minimal-feature and maximal-component/maximal-features cases.

40|$|Volltext: Many {{processes}} in labs, such as pharmaceutical, biotechnological and analytical labs, are {{strongly influenced by}} research activities {{in the field of}} biotechnology. Due to the enormous competition, these labs are forced to integrate new methods and technologies as soon as possible. Also, they are forced to cut costs and transfer the {{processes in}}to reliable "industrial manufacturing processes". Todays labs which are in the situation described above, have a high potential for rationalisation of the lab processes. These potentials can be utilised in three steps: <b>Standardisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>products</b> and the processes, Improvement of the data and material flow as well as the working procedures, and Implementation of custom-tailored and adapted automation. Utilising the potentials leads to an increased efficiency and therefore higher productivity, better quality, shorter cycle times and reduced costs.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the domain}} of Building Information Modelling (BIM), the open <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> methods for <b>product</b> and process {{modelling}} is undertaken by the buildingSMART association. Currently, buildingSMART recommends the use of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) for creating process models in Information Delivery Manuals (IDMs). This paper argues that BPMN is {{closely linked to the}} waterfall nature of today’s BIM projects, leading to a number of issues including long project durations, lack of stakeholder involvement, and disconnect of processes and data. Subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM) is introduced as an alternative modelling approach for IDMs, based on its support for agile development that has the potential to address the above issues. Specifically, it is shown that S-BPM supports key concepts of agility, including stakeholder involvement, individual creativity, collaboration, rapid prototyping, and iterative design. The increased agility of S-BPM based IDM development can help make BIM projects faster, more flexible and better adapted to the needs of BIM users...|$|R

Several CAPP and CAM systems related to STEP-NC compliance are under implementation or commercialisation around the world but the focus for turning operations has been limited in the second aspect. This paper describes and illustrates a STEP compliant CAD/CAPP/CAM System for the manufacture of rotational parts on CNC turning centres. The information models to support the proposed system together with the information models defined in the ISO 14649 standard used to create the NC programs are also described. A structured view of a STEP compliant CAD/CAPP/CAM system framework supporting {{the next generation of}} intelligent CNC controllers for turn/mill component manufacture is provided. Finally the authors proposed system is outlined by the modelling of a turn/mill workstation and through the use of user interface dialogs that depict the information held in the models. A case study component has been developed to prove the concept for using the milling and turning parts of ISO 14649 to provide a turn-mill CAD/CAPP/CAM environment. The framework focuses on the <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> turn/mill <b>product</b> and manufacturing information models ensure that the content is consistent throughout the product life cycle enabling quality assured manufacturing...|$|R

This article focuses on the largely neglected question of how firms organize their marketing activities across countries. With our empirical study which differentiates between marketing planning, marketing implementation and marketing control we contribute to international configuration and coordination literature. Our findings indicate that firms show a preference for centralising their marketing planning and marketing control activities, whereas the implementation of their marketing activities is more decentralised. For the coordination of marketing activities, in management practice, direct personal supervision and informal communication are the preferred coordination mechanisms. However, we not only describe existing configuration-coordination profiles, but also identify effective, efficient and resource-supportive patterns. Our results show that marketing activities are best coordinated by applying superior levels of direct personal supervision and output coordination plus the superior use of socialisation and networks...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} internationalisation and globalisation of competition, companies {{become more and more}} international. The commercialisation <b>of</b> <b>products</b> and services in different countries means, that companies are often confronted with cultural differences. By reason of these cultural differences it can happen, that the advertising remains inefficient, because the target group can’t understand the message. The most failures in international marketing happen because of the neglect of cultural differences. Therefore every international company should carefully think about a differentiation or <b>standardisation</b> <b>of</b> their <b>products</b> and advertising in other countries. The aim of this work is to identify the cultural differences in communication and advertising and therefore show the difficulties which can be connected with international products and advertisement. Furthermore this work should demonstrate how culture can affect advertisement and explore if there is a potential for standardisation in international marketing. The focus of this work is on cultural diversity and the impact on international marketing. To {{find out more about the}} perception of international advertisement an online questionnaire was created. Therefore it was possible to gain important information. This questionnaire and the literature research lead to the conclusion of this work. The questionnaires as well as the literature research are showing that it is very difficult to achieve a total standardisation in international marketing. Although people are using worldwide almost identical products, the cultural differences are still too great for a global market. Advertisement which is created for a specific market seems more often reliable and comprehensible. However for some parts of the marketingmix a standardisation is definitely possible. Therefore the best strategy for companies is to use a mix between differentiation and standardisation. Cultural differences will still remain in the future. The consideration of cultural differences in the future will therefore lead to a competitive advantage. Companies should pay attention to culture diversity, although it can lead to higher costs, to achieve the best results in international markets...|$|R

The first task to optimise fermented foods process is the knowledge of microorganism physiological and metabolic traits. Acetic acid bacteria species occurring in vinegar production are well known, but species monitoring and strains selection are not common procedures. Then there are not extensive studies on significant traits of strains involved in vinegar oxidation process. Concerning to traditional balsamic vinegars few researches are available about occurring species and their physiological traits. In this study strains isolated from traditional balsamic vinegar samples were investigated by enzymatic digestion of ITS 1 regions using RsaI and HaeIII restriction endonucleases and by sequencing of 16 S rDNA and ITS 1 rDNA. Since elevated sugar concentration resistance and growing is an important trait for traditional balsamic vinegar acetic acid bacteria, the isolated strains were tested for glucose tolerance. On the basis of technological results glucose concentration is an acetic acid bacteria limiting-factor and Acetobacter malorum species is more resistant to high glucose concentration than other species occurred in balsamic vinegar.

We have evaluated 20 Cuban propolis extracts of different chemical types, brown (BCP), red and yellow (YCP), {{with respect to their}} in vitro antibacterial, antifungal and antiprotozoal properties. The extracts inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Trichophyton rubrum at low µg/mL concentrations, whereas they were not active against Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. The major activity of the extracts was found against the protozoa Leishmania, Trypanosoma and Plasmodium, although cytotoxicity against MRC- 5 cells was also observed. The BCP- 3, YCP- 39 and YCP- 60 extracts showed the highest activity against P. falciparum, with 50 % of microbial growth (IC 50) values of 0. 2 µg/mL. A positive correlation between the biological activity and the chemical composition was observed for YCP extracts. The most promising antimicrobial activity corresponds to YCP subtype B, which contains acetyl triterpenes as the main constituents. The present in vitro study highlights the potential of propolis against protozoa, but {{further research is needed to}} increase selectivity towards the parasite.
