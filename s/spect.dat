5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} usually {{diagnosed}} {{based on the}} person's medical history, history from relatives, and behavioural observations. The presence of characteristic neurological and neuropsychological features {{and the absence of}} alternative conditions is supportive. Advanced medical imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and with single-photon emission computed tomography (<b>SPECT)</b> or positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to help exclude other cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia. Moreover, it may predict conversion from prodromal stages (mild cognitive impairment) to Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine-related {{activity}} in the basal ganglia can be directly measured with PET and <b>SPECT</b> scans. A finding of reduced dopamine-related {{activity in}} the basal ganglia can rule out drug-induced parkinsonism, but reduced basal ganglia dopamine-related activity is seen in both PD and the Parkinson-plus disorders so these scans are not reliable in distinguishing PD from other neurodegenerative causes of parkinsonism.|$|E

It features {{the story on}} Mapleshade, a strong ThunderClan warrior and a forbidden love and vengeance. It also detales on how she felt about the situation, and how cats she murdered ruined her life, which in precro <b>spect,</b> they did.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the many}} medical imaging {{techniques}} available, single photon emission computed tomography (<b>SPECT)</b> {{appears to be}} superior in differentiating Alzheimer's disease from other types of dementia, {{and this has been}} shown to give a greater level of accuracy compared with mental testing and medical history analysis. Advances have led to the proposal of new diagnostic criteria.|$|E
5|$|The other iodine radioisotopes {{have much}} shorter half-lives, {{no longer than}} days. Some of them have medical {{applications}} involving the thyroid gland, where the iodine that enters the body is stored and concentrated. Iodine-123 has a half-life of thirteen hours and decays by electron capture to tellurium-123, emitting gamma radiation; it is used in nuclear medicine imaging, including single photon emission computed tomography (<b>SPECT)</b> and X-ray computed tomography (X-Ray CT) scans. Iodine-125 has a half-life of fifty-nine days, decaying by electron capture to tellurium-125 and emitting low-energy gamma radiation; the second-longest-lived iodine radioisotope, it has uses in biological assays, nuclear medicine imaging and in radiation therapy as brachytherapy to treat a number of conditions, including prostate cancer, uveal melanomas, and brain tumours. Finally, iodine-131, with a half-life of eight days, beta decays to an excited state of stable xenon-131 that then converts to the ground state by emitting gamma radiation. It is a common fission product and thus is present in high levels in radioactive fallout. It may then be absorbed through contaminated food, and will also accumulate in the thyroid. As it decays, it may cause damage to the thyroid. The primary risk from exposure {{to high levels of}} iodine-131 is the chance occurrence of radiogenic thyroid cancer in later life. Other risks include the possibility of non-cancerous growths and thyroiditis. The usual means of protection against the negative effects of iodine-131 is by saturating the thyroid gland with stable iodine-127 in the form of potassium iodide tablets, taken daily for optimal prophylaxis. However, iodine-131 may also be used for medicinal purposes in radiation therapy for this very reason, when tissue destruction is desired after iodine uptake by the tissue. Iodine-131 is also used as a radioactive tracer.|$|E

25|$|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) {{depends on}} {{magnetic}} {{activity in the}} brain and does not use X-rays, so it is considered more safe than imaging techniques that do use X-rays. <b>SPECT</b> uses gamma rays, which are characteristically more safe than other imaging systems using alpha or beta rays. Both PET and <b>SPECT</b> scans require the injection of radioactive materials, but the half-lives of isotopes used in <b>SPECT</b> can be more easily managed.|$|E

25|$|Neuroimaging is {{controversial}} in whether it provides specific patterns unique to neuroborreliosis, but may aid in differential diagnosis and {{in understanding the}} pathophysiology of the disease. Though controversial, some evidence shows certain neuroimaging tests can provide data that are helpful in the diagnosis of a patient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (<b>SPECT)</b> {{are two of the}} tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a patient affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white matter, as well as enlarged ventricles and cortical atrophy. The findings are considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions {{have been found to be}} reversible following antibiotic treatment. Images produced using <b>SPECT</b> show numerous areas where an insufficient amount of blood is being delivered the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, <b>SPECT</b> images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the <b>SPECT</b> images are very similar to those seen in people with cerebral vacuities and Creutzfeldtâ€“Jakob disease, which makes them questionable.|$|E

25|$|Most recently, technetium-99m {{scintigraphy}} {{has been}} combined with CT coregistration technology to produce SPECT/CT scans. These employ the same radioligands {{and have the}} same uses as <b>SPECT</b> scanning, but are able to provide even finer 3-D localization of high-uptake tissues, in cases where finer resolution is needed. An example is the sestamibi parathyroid scan which is performed using the Tc-99m radioligand sestamibi, and {{can be done in}} either <b>SPECT</b> or SPECT/CT machines.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{methods of}} {{scanning}} include x-ray computed tomography (CT), {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), ultrasound and single-photon emission computed tomography (<b>SPECT).</b>|$|E
25|$|Like PET, <b>SPECT</b> {{also can}} be used to {{differentiate}} different kinds of disease processes which produce dementia, and it is increasingly used for this purpose. Neuro-PET has a disadvantage of requiring use of tracers with half-lives of at most 110 minutes, such as FDG. These must be made in a cyclotron, and are expensive or even unavailable if necessary transport times are prolonged more than a few half-lives. <b>SPECT,</b> however, is able to make use of tracers with much longer half-lives, such as technetium-99m, and as a result, is far more widely available.|$|E

25|$|Single photon {{emission}} computed tomography (<b>SPECT)</b> is a nuclear medicine imaging technique using gamma rays. It {{may be used}} with any gamma-emitting isotope, including Tc-99m. In the use of technetium-99m, the radioisotope is administered to {{the patient and the}} escaping gamma rays are incident upon a moving gamma camera which computes and processes the image. To acquire <b>SPECT</b> images, the gamma camera is rotated around the patient. Projections are acquired at defined points during the rotation, typically every three to six degrees. In most cases, a full 360Â° rotation is used to obtain an optimal reconstruction. The time taken to obtain each projection is also variable, but 15â€“20 seconds are typical. This gives a total scan time of 15â€“20 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Several {{clinical}} trials with angiogenic gene therapy {{have been completed}} with promising efficacy and safety data (e.g. AGENT trials). These trials tested intracoronary administration of Ad5FGF-4 in over 450 patients and demonstrated {{the safety of the}} product and the procedure. It is notable that when exercise tolerance was used as the primary end-point, the product did not achieve statistically significant effect primarily due to high placebo effect in the control groups. In contrast, when the more objective end-point of <b>SPECT</b> (measuring the extent of reversible myocardial ischemia) was used in the AGENT-2 clinical study, intracoronary administration of Ad5FGF4 resulted in a statistically significant therapeutic effect. Currently ongoing pivotal (Phase 3) clinical studies use myocardial perfusion (as measured by <b>SPECT)</b> as the primary end point.|$|E
25|$|EEG {{sensors can be}} used in {{more places}} than fMRI, <b>SPECT,</b> PET, MRS, or MEG, as these {{techniques}} require bulky and immobile equipment.
