Contrastingly, abundant fibrous tissue filled ASC-free alginate layer encapsulating the acellular PEGDA core in control implants. Human-specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) was detected in human ASC-seeded implants. Interestingly, rat-specific PPAR-γ was absent in either human ASC-seeded or ASC-free implants. Glycerol content in ASC-delivered implants was significantly greater than that in ASC-free implants. Remarkably, rat-specific platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) was detected in both ASC-seeded and ASC-free implants, suggesting anastomosis of vasculature in bioengineered tissue with host blood vessels.

The materials of the research are mycelium and culture filtrates (CF) of 57 strains (5 belong to 5 species from the order Polyporales s. l., and 52 belong to 7 species of the order Agaricales s. l.). To study the dynamics of growth we used a weighing method for determining the accumulation of absolutely dry biomass. Intensity of lipid peroxidation was determined by a modified spectrophotometric method for content of active to thiobarbituric acid products. It was found that the most productive in absolutely dry biomass accumulation were the strains Flammulina velutipes (Curt. : Fr.) Sing. F- 610 and Pleurotus eryngii (DC. : Fr.) Quél. P-er. The level of spontaneous and induced LPO intensity in mycelia of all strains was higher than this figure in the culture filtrate and increased with the duration of cultivation. Dependencies between the content of lipid peroxidation products in the mycelia and CF were not established. The lowest values were recorded for biomass accumulation by the strains Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq. : Fr.) P.  Kumm. P- 14, P- 192 and P. citrinopileatus Singer. Р-сіtr. Groups of basidiomycete cultures with different levels of TBA-AP were identified. Spontaneous and induced intensivity of lipid peroxidation in all studied strains of mycelia was higher than the figure in the culture filtrate. The intensity of lipid peroxidation in both mycelia and culture filtrate constantly increased, which {{can be explained by the}} growing shortage of certain nutrients (primarily carbon) and increased concentration of metabolic products in the medium. The ratio of spontaneous and induced lipid peroxidation intensity is specific to each strain and is independent of its systematic position. Shifting of prooxidant-antioxidant balance to a relatively stationary level is a mark of stress reaction. LPO-products can be both inductors and primary mediators of stress as a special class of biological systems.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{calculation}} and comparison indications of {{the condition of the}} prooxidant-antioxidant system (PAS) of strains of Basidiomycetes under periodic <b>surface</b> <b>cultivation</b> on a glucose-peptone medium. The research material consisted of the mycelium and culture filtrate (CF) from 57 strains, 52 of them belonging to 7 species of the order Agaricales and 5 belonging to 5 species of the order Polyporales. The intensity of the processes of lipid peroxidation was determined by a modified spectrophotometric method for contents of active products to thiobarbituric acid. Total antioxidant activity (АОА) of the mycological material was evaluated by intensity of inhibition from accumulated products of lipid peroxide oxidation (LPO) in a model reaction of oxidation by Twin- 80 oxygen of the air. From the data obtained, indicators of prooxidant activity (POA), indicators of reserve of substrate peroxidation (SPO) and the balance coefficient of the prooxidant-antioxidant system (CbPАS) were calculated. It was established that strains of Basidiomycetes are characterized by significant predominance of prooxidant activity characteristic of PAS in the culture filtrate in comparison with the mycelium indicator. The highest values of POA in the Culture Filtrate were observed on the 12 -th day of cultivation for the strain Р- 089 genus Pleurotus and strain Gl- 2 genus Ganoderma, and for the mycelium on the 9 -th day of cultivation for the strains Р-сіtr, Р- 089, Р-er and Р- 082 of the genus Pleurotus. There is a direct dependence between the indicators of POA in the CF and mycelium for each strain, this dependence and level of indication do not reflect their systematic placement. We distinguished a more significant prevalence of indicators of reserve of substrates peroxidation of mycelium for most strains, than for such indicators with CF The highest value of reserve SPO of mycelium was recorded for strains Р- 447, Р- 998, Р- 039, Р- 94, Р- 2175, Р-сіtr, Р-er, D- 140 of the genus Pleurotus and strains F- 107, F- 610 of the genus Flammulina. For the majority of the strains there was a clear prevalence of the values of the balance coefficients for PAS of mycelium over those of CF. Maximum values of the balance coefficient PAS of mycelium on the 9 -th day were recorded for strains Т- 10 (F. fomentarius) and D- 140, Р- 035, Р- 01, Р- 105 (P. ostreatus) and on the 12 -th day for strains Sc- 10 (S. commune), Р-kl, Р- 14 (P. ostreatus), Р-er (P. eryngii) і 960 (A. cylindracea). The abovementioned strains are distinguished by the with high level of AOA in the mycelium on certain days of cultivation and can be recommended as producers of antioxidants of fungal origin...|$|E
40|$|The {{cultivation}} system {{consists of two}} types of irradiance modules – vertical, lower-irradiance unit (close to ambient conditions) and roof, higher-irradiance unit (up to 3. 5 -times higher than ambient intensity) which are {{used to compare the}} growth and behaviour of microalgal cultures of various density at high light intensities. The aim of these experiments has been to monitor a diel course of irradiance intensity and spectral composition concentrated by Linear Fresnel lenses and the light distribution on the <b>surface</b> and inside <b>cultivation</b> tubes. As a model organism, we have used the cyanobacterium Spirulina platensis M 2. Three concentration of biomass (about 0. 5, 1 and 2 g L- 1) have been tested. In higher-irradiance modules we also follow the induction of carotenoids synthesi...|$|R
40|$|The lava park is {{surrounded}} by the volcanic mountains of Les Preses, revealed as the edges of a vast caldera and repeated at a human scale with low walls made up of small volcanic boulders. These walls are evidence of how successive communities have gradually worked amongst this lava flow to create arable land, supported by rich soils. The people saw the land prosper and learned how to maximise its productivity. Boulders {{that had come to}} the <b>surface</b> during agricultural <b>cultivation</b> were moved with human labour to create "artigas“, the characteristic pilings of volcanic stone. They have been used to raise and lower areas, to create shelter and exposure for their crops and to make caves for storage. Amongst all this, paths weave and cross. The whole place is made up of grey and black rocks with a constant cover of green crops or grass...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFull-sun cocoa {{farming is}} {{currently}} the most widespread cocoa cultivation system in humid and sub-humid Côte d’Ivoire. Higher short-term yields from increasing <b>surfaces</b> under <b>cultivation</b> in this farming system {{have contributed to the}} country being ranked as top cocoa producer in the world. However the negative consequences including biodiversity loss, soil fertility depletion and soil quality degradation associated with this system, have incredibly received so less attention that the type and magnitude of such agro-ecological consequences within the current context of climate change are worth investigating. The present study was undertaken in the former cocoa belt of Central-Western Côte d’Ivoire, precisely in the Oumé Department. The main objective was {{to assess the impact of}} forest conversion to full-sun cocoa plantations on above and below-ground biodiversity along with soil quality by measuring chemical, physical and biological parameters along a chronosequence of different ages (5, 10 and 20 years). The results are summarized as follows: (i) the conversion of semi-deciduous forests to cocoa plantations resulted in plant diversity and species richness loss due to the disappearance of a huge number of native species while earthworm abundance and species richness increased due to the appearance of species adapted to degraded lands, (ii) soil quality was severely impaired by cocoa farming with the worse scenario being found under the 10 -year-old cocoa plantations, where SOC, total N, CEC contributed mostly to soil quality degradation. The contribution of these findings to devise options for sustainable tree-based cocoa farming is discussed...|$|R
