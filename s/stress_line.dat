He argued that contemporary listeners were accustomed to assonance and consonantal rhyme but it could also be argued that this form of 'rough' rhyme was common in early English drama and that Slater was restoring it to the stage, rather than inventing something new. Slater's original libretto, which he published himself (to the annoyance of Britten and Peter Pears, who had made a number of amendments to it before the opera was staged), is cast in three acts. It omits the repetitions necessary in the actual opera.|$|E

The findings showed that the mean value of hardness was varied with load and stress. Higher load and stress were found to be not affected by hardness of EMCs. From the results, it is believed that the applied load and stress not play a role towards the hardness of EMCs. A polynomial relationship was plotted and shown that correlation of coefficient (R 2) between stress and hardness of the studied EMCs was found to be at 97 %.

40|$|Chronic {{stress is}} a problem {{not only in terms}} of its {{psychological}} effects but also due to the harmful physiological changes induced in the individual. Although chronic stress is recognized as detrimental and rampant throughout society, the stress system itself remains poorly understood in terms of comprehending which genes are involved in regulating and carrying out stress-induced signals. In a previous study, 57 candidate genes in the stress pathway had been identified based on the presence of stress-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and differential expression from microarray data. The objective of this study was to investigate Additional Sex Combs-Like 2 (ASXL 2), one of those 57 candidate genes, and to determine if it was part of the stress pathway through SNP identification and Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Utilizing sequencing data of ASXL 2 from Pubmed as well as SNP locations generated from DNASTAR’s SeqMan Ngen Assembly, SNPs were identified within the actual reference genome verifying the normal and mutant base pair for each SNP. After identifying SNPs of ASXL 2 within the low <b>stress</b> <b>line</b> of Japanese quail, RT-PCR was performed in order to determine if mRNA expression for ASXL 2 would change under acute and chronic stress. In order to perform RT-PCR, primers were designed and then tested utilizing gel electrophoresis in order to ensure optimization of the PCR product. ΔΔCT methodology was then used to determine the veracity of the mean fold expression changes found for ASXL 2 under acute and chronic stress. As part of the experiment to determine the potential role of ASXL 2 in the stress pathway, four SNPs were identified with high SNP rates in the low <b>stress</b> <b>line</b> of Japanese quail within ASXL 2. After performing RT-PCR, it was found that ASXL 2 was up regulated by 14 % under acute stress and down regulated by 24 % under chronic stress in comparison to the acute control group and chronic control group respectively. P-values of 0. 0013 and 0. 0004 for acute and chronic stress respectively indicate that the data are statistically significant. β-Actin was set at a value of 1. 0 as an internal control in order to determine mean fold expression changes for ASXL 2 under differing stress conditions by using ΔΔCT methodology. Based on the high SNP rate as well as the differential expression of ASXL 2 under acute and chronic stress, ASXL 2 has been directly implicated as a stress-related gene. Although ASXL 2 ’s exact role within the stress pathway is unknown, its interactions with trithorax and Polycomb group genes as an epigenetic modifier make it an interesting candidate for further research to determine its possible role in the epigenetic effects of acute and chronic stress...|$|E
40|$|Principal stress-lines are {{pairs of}} {{orthogonal}} curves that indicate trajectories of internal forces. Subsequently, these curves idealize paths of material continuity, and naturally encode the optimal topology for any structure {{for a given}} set of boundary conditions. Stress-line analysis {{has the potential to}} offer a direct and geometrically-provocative approach to optimization that can synthesize both design and structural objectives. However, its application in design has generally been limited {{due to a lack of}} standardization and parameterization of the process for generating and interpreting stress lines. Addressing these barriers, this thesis proposes a new implementation framework that enables designers to take advantage of stress-line analysis to inform conceptual structural design. Central to the premise of this research is a new conception of structurally-inspired design exploration that does not impose a singular solution, but instead allows for the exploration of a diverse high-performance design space in order to balance the combination of structural and architectural design objectives. Specifically, the thesis has immediate application for the topological design of both regular and irregular thin shell structures predominately subjected to in-plane and compressive structural actions. by Kam-Ming Mark Tam.

The delay time is determined {{as a function of}} the applied stress at temperatures of - 75 °F, 73 °F, 150 °F, and 250 °F. The stress is applied in a continuous manner within a period of about 7 millisec, and the stress is maintained substantially constant thereafter, until plastic deformation begins. At any given temperature, the relation between the logarithm of the delay time and the stress is found to consist of two straight lines which join together at a point in the delay time and the stress plane. One is a line of constant stress, and the other is a line along which the logarithm of the delay time decreases linearly as the stress is increased above the constant <b>stress</b> <b>line.</b> The experimental results are compared with a dislocation theory of yielding in low carbon steel which has been given by A.

40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} in this paper to show that a runaway type of pre-failure instability can occur for sand under dilatancy rate controlled conditions when an appropriate strain increment ratio, dεv/dε 1, is imposed. This type of instability is similar to the runaway type of instability observed for very loose sand under undrained conditions. Whether a soil element will undergo pre-failure instability depends on the difference between the strain increment ratio of the soil obtained from drained test, under a specified effective confining pressure, (dεv/dε 1) s, and the strain increment ratio imposed during the test, (dεv/dε 1) i, rather than the absolute magnitude of (dεv/dε 1) i. Based on the experimental data obtained in this study it was found that an instability line can be determined from a series of strain path tests conducted at different effective confining pressures but with the same dεv/dε 1 by joining the peak points of the effective stress paths to the origin in the q–p′ stress space. This line is similar to the instability line obtained from undrained tests on loose sand. The instability tests under dilatancy rate controlled conditions indicate that the stress ratio at the onset of instability obtained in the instability tests coincide with the peak stress ratio line. This suggests that the peak <b>stress</b> <b>line</b> can be used to predict the onset of instability under dilatancy rate controlled conditions {{in the same way as}} the use of instability line to predict the onset of instability under undrained conditions...|$|E
