50|$|In 1608, an {{earthquake}} caused damage {{many of the}} buildings in the city. Between 1610-1611, the building was remodelled, resulting in the refurbishment {{of the building and}} expand the municipal square. Drawings of the building at that time showed a two-storey building with its front facade including three divisions, with its lateral wings with single windows over <b>sill</b> <b>on</b> the ground <b>floor</b> and two windows with cornices <b>on</b> the second <b>floor.</b> The central section included an arcade with five rounded arches surmounted by varanda supporting an architrave, and accessible by lateral staircases. At the top of the central wing was a two-storey rectangular belltower, crowned by pinnacles. In addition to its administrative municipal function, the building sheltered simultaneously the jail and courts services.|$|R
60|$|The {{morning was}} very bright, and the janitor {{had left the}} hornet's window {{slightly}} open. At noon he was lying <b>on</b> the window <b>sill,</b> drunk as usual. I {{was in a hurry}} to take a train, and neglected to close the window. Late at night, when I came back to my room, he was gone. He was not <b>on</b> the <b>sill,</b> nor <b>on</b> the <b>floor,</b> nor under the window cushions. His nest in the casing, where I had so often watched him asleep, was empty. Taking a candle, I went out to search under the window. There I found him in the snow, his legs curled up close to his body, frozen stiff with the drip of the eaves.|$|R

50|$|Fleming House (1898) is a two-storeyed {{building}} {{located at}} the southeastern corner of the cricket oval, amongst lawns and mature trees. It is constructed of light-coloured brick with narrow bands of red bricks at <b>sill</b> level <b>on</b> both <b>floors</b> and at the upper floor-line. It has a hipped roof with boxed-in eaves and decorative timber brackets. A detached bathroom building (1920) is centrally located on the southern elevation; it has a pyramid roof with a raised central roof lantern and a lean-to addition at the rear with a brick chimney. There is a verandah <b>on</b> the ground <b>floor</b> <b>on</b> the northern side, overlooking the cricket oval. A centrally-located metal staircase dominates this elevation of the building. Narrow casement windows with concrete sills and lintels are found on all elevations.Gladstone House, Jenner House and Kelsey House (all 1936) are located {{to the east of}} Fleming House and are nearly identical in form, scale and detail. Like Fleming House, these buildings are situated to overlook the cricket oval. The buildings are all single-storeyed brick buildings with unusual crab-like plan-forms, set within gardens enclosed with low wire fences. The gardens are mostly lawn with mature trees such as Poincianas. The central portion of each building comprises a large dining/day room with service facilities such as kitchens and bathrooms to the rear. The four wings of each building contain dormitories and single rooms. Each of the dining rooms has a large roof lantern with fixed glass panels that allow natural light to penetrate the room. Each of the buildings has terracotta tiled roofs and large casement windows which have aluminium security screens fitted on the outside.Lewis House, McDonnell House and Noble House (all 1915) are ward buildings of similar design, located along Barrett Drive. On the eastern side the buildings overlook lawns and the cricket oval. A service road runs along the western side and the surroundings of the buildings are paved in concrete with a raised garden strip containing mature trees between the buildings and Barrett Drive. Lewis House is situated between Kelsey House and McDonnell House and is a substantial two-storeyed rendered masonry building with a terracotta-tiled roof. It has gabled roofs with parapetted gable ends and subtle quoins <b>on</b> the upper <b>floor.</b> The southern elevation has a projecting wing with pyramid-roofed pavilions at each corner and small square windows. The rest of the building has large casement windows throughout and is smooth rendered to <b>sill</b> height <b>on</b> the second <b>floor</b> and roughcast above. A short verandah with vertical timber louvres is located <b>on</b> the ground <b>floor</b> of the eastern elevation. McDonnell House is situated between Lewis House and Noble House. It is also two-storeyed and constructed of masonry but is more rectangular in plan with three short wings projecting on the western elevation. It has a large gabled roof and gabled roofs on the western wings, all of which have overhanging eaves. The roof is clad in dark concrete tiles and the building is rendered smooth up to <b>sill</b> height <b>on</b> the second <b>floor,</b> above which it is roughcast. There are two ground <b>floor</b> verandahs <b>on</b> the eastern elevation overlooking the cricket oval, either side of a central projecting gable. Noble House is almost identical to Lewis House but a concrete tiled roof has replaced the terracotta roof and it has a longer verandah <b>on</b> the ground <b>floor</b> <b>on</b> the eastern elevation.|$|R

50|$|In October 2006, {{custodians}} {{began to}} notice small paint chips and sawdust <b>on</b> window <b>sills</b> <b>on</b> the Union's third floor. Expert inspectors quickly deduced that the roof beams above the third floor were pushing the lintels <b>on</b> the third <b>floor</b> windows down, which pushed the walls apart and also pressed against {{the walls of the}} north wing. Construction quickly began to rescue the building, and more than $1 million was spent to remove the brick on the east and west sides of the building, strengthen the beams, and repair the walls. The work was completed in the spring of 2007.|$|R
