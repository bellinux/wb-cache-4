40|$|OBJECTIVES: The gastric {{emptying}} {{breath test}} (GEBT) is now routinely {{used in many}} centers. Validation studies in adults have shown that {{although there is a}} linear correlation between the GEBT and scintigraphy, the GEBT overestimates gastric half emptying time (GEt 1 / 2) by a constant of approximately 60 minutes because of postgastric processing. It is therefore conventional to apply a "correction factor" to the GEBT result. Because = no similar validation studies have been performed in infants, the aim {{of this study was to}} directly characterize the postgastric processing of 13 C octanoic acid in infants to assess the suitability of the <b>standard</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> for use in infants. METHODS: The pattern of breath 13 CO 2 excretion after separate infusion of 13 C octanoic acid into either the stomach or the duodenum was measured in 13 healthy preterm infants (6 male, 7 female). The raw 13 CO 2 half excretion time after intragastric (GEt 1 / 2 raw) and intraduodenal (DEt 1 / 2 raw) administration of C octanoic acid was calculated, and the difference between GEt 1 / 2 raw and DEt 1 / 2 raw (i. e., GEt 1 / 2 raw - DEt 1 / 2 raw) was directly compared with GEt 1 / 2 corrected, derived by applying the <b>standard</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> to GEt 1 / 2 raw. RESULTS: Values for GEt 1 / 2 raw - DEt 1 / 2 raw correlated significantly with GEt 1 / 2 corrected. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the <b>standard</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> is appropriate for performing the GEBT in preterm infants...|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} this work was to apply a method for {{estimation}} of total scatter factors of the smallest beams of the Cyberknife radiosurgery system to newly available solid-state detectors: the PTW 60008 diode, the SunNuclear EdgeDetectorTM diode, and the Thomson and Nielsen TN 502 RDM micromosfet. The method {{is based on a}} consistency check between Monte Carlo simulation of the detectors and experimental results, and was described in a recent publication. Corrected total scatter factors were in excellent agreement with the findings of the former study. The results showed that the diodes tend to overestimate the total scatter factor of small beams, probably due to excessive scatter from the material surrounding the active layer. The <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> for diodes and for the micromosfet, however, was found to be independent of the electron beam width. This is a desirable characteristic because it allows <b>standard</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> to be used for treatment units of the same type, without the need of case-by-case Monte Carlo simulation...|$|R
40|$|We present {{simultaneous}} Chandra High-Energy Transmission Gratings (HETG) and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) {{observations of}} a "soft state" {{of the black}} hole candidate 4 U 1957 + 11. These spectra, having limited hard X-ray excess, are an excellent test of disk atmosphere models that include effects of black hole spin. The HETG data show, by modeling the broadband continuum and direct fitting of absorption edges, that the disk spectrum is only very mildly absorbed, with N[subscript H] = (1 – 2) × 10 [superscript 21] cm−[superscript 2]. These data additionally reveal λλ 13. 449 Ne IX absorption consistent with the warm/hot phase of the interstellar medium. The fitted disk model implies an inclined disk around a low-mass black hole rotating with normalized spin a* ≈ 1. We show, however, that pure Schwarzschild models describe the data extremely well, albeit with large disk atmosphere ``color-correction'' <b>factors.</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> can be attained if one incorporates mild Comptonization. We find that the Chandra observations do not uniquely determine spin, even with this otherwise extremely well-measured, nearly pure disk spectrum. XMM-Newton RXTE observations, taken only six weeks later, are equally unconstraining. This lack of constraint is partly driven by the unknown mass and distance of 4 U 1957 + 11; however, it is also driven by the limited Chandra and XMM-Newton bandpasses. We therefore present a series of 48 RXTE observations taken at different brightness/hardness levels. These data prefer a spin of a* ≈ 1, even when including a mild Comptonization component; however, they also show evolution of the color-correction factors. If the rapid-spin models with <b>standard</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> are to be believed, then the RXTE observations predict that 4 U 1957 + 11 can range from a 3 M[sun] black hole at 10 kpc with a* ≈ 0. 83 to a 16 M[sun] black hole at 22 kpc with a* ≈ 1.

40|$|Normalization of RO {{membrane}} flux {{and salt}} passage data {{is an important}} pre-requisite for better RO plant design, performance efficiency calculation and quality assurance on par with WHO and other <b>standards.</b> <b>Correction</b> <b>factors</b> are required for standardizing the actual data {{to a set of}} fixed conditions at constant pressure, temperature and concentration. Determination of pressure <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> (PCF) necessitates continuous calculation of osmotic pressure by summation of molalities of individual ion concentrations in solutions. This necessitates complete and laborious chemical analyses of water samples. Hence, the practice has been to apply factors to convert electrical conductivity into TDS (e. g. for seawater TDS= 0. 7 x conductivity) and finally TDS into osmotic pressure in data normalization steps. A drawback of this conversion is that it results in a linear relationship, which is not realistic, since the ionic activity (conductivity) versus concentration is not a linear function, but rather a second order polynomial. Moreover, accuracy in TDS measurement is hardly possible. The magnitude of the colligative properties and, therefore, osmotic pressure depends upon concentration of ions in the solution and upon their activity. But the solution complexity and concentration in seawater do not obey the generalized theories of colligative properties. So, an alternate method has been developed for the calculation of osmotic pressure directly from conductivity. The new method, described in this paper, {{has been found to be}} simple and more reliable. In this method, the osmotic pressure (p in bar) is calculated directly from the seawater p...|$|R

40|$|One {{technique}} to create small Pt and Au nano scale direct structures is Electron Beam Induced Deposition (EBID). These structures however, often suffer from included carbon, as the related precursor often is an organo metallic chemical substance. Research programs focus on optimizing the EBID process {{to minimize the}} carbon content of the deposition. A fast and good in-situ method to {{determine the amount of}} carbon, is low kV EDX. However, in existing systems the x-ray N lines of Au and Pt can be completely ignored because their lines are not included in the library of x-ray lines, and as their energies are close to the carbon K alpha energy they fall within the typical energy resolution width of the detector (~ 40 eV at C K) and hence are accounted for as originating from carbon. As a consequence substantial errors are introduced. Especially in nano technology and thin film applications, low kV excitation is a must and as a consequence the x-ray N lines of these metals cannot be ignored. This is not common practice in existing commercial EDAX systems while x-ray N line lines are not reported in for example the NIST database. Their energies but not their intensities were found in [1]. To correct the situation, the excitation ratio of the M multiplet and N doublet lines has been determined {{as a function of the}} applied kV for both Pt and Au> with this measurement using pure <b>standards,</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> for the carbon net intensities have been determined.

In this way the research for purity developments of EBID based structures is improved and EDX can be applied correctly. PhysicsApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-one {{surveys have}} been {{conducted}} using a Cessna 182 in the pastoral zone of South Australia, covering the twenty year period 1978 to 1998, flying the same transects and using the same method. Considerable {{attention has been given}} to observer training and the turnover rate of observers has been low. The same pilot has flown all surveys. The pastoral zone is bounded in the north and west by a dingo-proof fence. Large lakes and areas of terrain above 2000 ft elevation (notably the Flinders Ranges) were excluded from the survey, leaving a surveyed area of approximately 207 000 square km. Surveys are conducted each year in July/August, with morning and afternoon survey sessions. Transects run east/west and are 15 nautical miles (28 km) apart. The method has followed what has become the standard for fixed-wing surveys: a height of 250 ft (76 m) above ground (AGL), a ground speed of 100 knots (185 km h- 1), 5 km unit lengths (97 sec.) with a 7 sec. pause between each and animals counted in 200 m wide strips each side of the aircraft, demarcated by streamers attached to the wing struts. A radar altimeter is used to maintain height above the terrain and, since 1989, a global positioning system has been used to ensure adherence to the transect and to maintain the required groundspeed. Red kangaroos, western grey kangaroos, common wallaroos, emus and goats are counted and other macro fauna noted (camels, horses, dingoes, ostriches, etc.). <b>Standard</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> have been applied throughout, except that, in the present paper, the data are recalculated to reflect the outcomes of this workshop concerning a move to modified <b>correction</b> <b>factors.</b> The results have highlighted the responsiveness of kangaroo populations to rainfall and pasture availability.

40|$|The use of hard {{structures}} to derive ecological information about fish populations {{is a fundamental}} tool in fisheries assessment, specifically the back-calculation of fish lengths. This study highlights the potential errors associated with <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> (c) because of poor sampling and provides a validation of (c) values. In addition, classical fisheries assumptions {{about the relationship between}} scale radius and fish body length were tested. As a result, variability or error of <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> can be reduced by having a minimum of 30 samples with at least 4 age classes represented. Alternatively the (c) provided {{can be used as a}} standard (c) factor for each species, eliminating the variance caused by poor sampling. Finally, the development of standard intercept values (based on observation of juvenile fish) should be promoted to replace or validate mathematically derived (c). The ability to accurately determine the age and growth of fish is an important tool in fishery biology and therefore it is fundamental to this work that all steps should be taken to increase the accuracy of back-calculated length-at-age data and account for size when fish lay down scales. To account for potential error associated with a <b>correction</b> <b>factor,</b> larval fish were routinely sampled to identify patterns of squamation, providing preliminary reference data for <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> used in back-calculation of fish length-at-age. Determination of the length at squamation for more specimens will allow for the derivation of <b>standard</b> <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> for each species that can be used across the species’ distribution. Geometric morphometric (GM) analysis of fish scales has been shown to be a good discriminator of genera using a fixed landmark approach. However, freshwater fish scales are often irregular in shape; therefore it is not possible to identify identical locations on all individuals. This study provides evidence that scale morphology can be used to discriminate riverine fish species. The analysis of fish scale morphology is inexpensive, quick, non-destructive, and informative and could easily be added to existing monitoring programmes. This study highlights the potentially important and opportunistic information that can be gained from the GM analysis of fish scales. It is therefore anticipated that this study will be fundamental in shaping future fish population assessments. It is recognised amongst scientists that fish growth rates vary across a catchment, with species typically achieving greater growth rates in their ‘preferred’ habitats. Similarly, previous authors have identified that growth variation exists for different species and populations. This study has found that the geographic location of a river/region influences the growth rates of freshwater fishes commonly found in England. The method of constructing regional growth curves and subsequent statistical analysis discussed in this study should be adopted by fisheries scientists, because current national growth rates may be unachievable in specific regions. Furthermore, current national curves are inappropriate for growth and population analysis because they may be biased by an individual river and/or region. This study is one of the few studies to examine the differences between regional recruitment success, and found similarities and differences at both the regional and national level. With recruitment success a key requirement of monitoring fish populations under the WFD, it is hoped the information provided here will aid fisheries scientists to understand the factors affecting regional and national recruitment success. Studies on the impact of climate change on fish populations have typically focused on suggesting, rather than predicting, the effects on lentic species rather than lotic species. Furthermore, these studies often deal with American rather than European ecosystems. To address this, predicted changes in the climate of the UK were used to model likely influences on fish populations, expressed as the length of young of year (YOY) fish achieved by the end of the first growth period (May-September), juvenile and adult growth (annual growth increment, AGI) and recruitment success (year class strength, YCS), for three cyprinid fish. This study found that climate change is likely to increase the propensity for cyprinid fish to thrive, although the exact mechanism will depend on inter-annual variability in temperature rises and the timing of flow events. Notwithstanding the limitations of this study, it provides ecologists with a greater understanding of climate change and its potential impact on European, lotic fish populations...|$|R

The application of vaporizable NH 4 OAc allows future use of the eluent system in two-dimensional separations employing evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD). The losses of samples during filtration and during the chromatographic experiment were determined. The scaling exponent as of the relation s 21 / 2 ~Mas was approx. 0. 61, showing that NaCMCs exhibit an expanded coil conformation in solution. No systematic dependencies of a s on DS were observed. The dependences of molar mass on SEC-elution volume for samples of different DS can be well described by a comm on calibration curve, which is of advantage, as it allows the determination of molar masses of unknown samples by using the same calibration curve, irrespective of the DS of the NaCMC sample. Since no commercial NaCMC <b>standards</b> are available, <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> were determined allowing converting a pullulan based calibration curve into a NaCMC calibration using the broad calibration approach.

40|$|In {{applications}} where leak {{rates of}} components or systems are evaluated against a leak rate requirement, {{the uncertainty of}} the measured leak rate must be included in the reported result. However, in the helium mass spectrometer leak detection method, the sensitivity, or resolution, of the instrument is often the only component of the total measurement uncertainty noted when reporting results. To address this shortfall, a measurement uncertainty analysis method was developed that includes the leak detector unit's resolution, repeatability, hysteresis, and drift, along with the uncertainty associated with the calibration standard. In a step-wise process, the method identifies the bias and precision components of the calibration <b>standard,</b> the measurement <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> (K-factor), and the leak detector unit. Together these individual contributions to error are combined and the total measurement uncertainty is determined using the root-sum-square method.

A thin end window allows the instrument to measure exposure rates from non-penetrating radiation (i. e., beta radiation). <b>Correction</b> <b>factors</b> are provided for contact measurements with beta and gamma disk sources, gamma beams and, finally, general area beta fields. Beta <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> {{are based on}} the instrument's response to 204 Tl, selected as the most conservative isotope for beta <b>correction</b> <b>factors,</b> as indicated in previous studies of similar instruments using 204 Tl, 147 Pm, and 90 Sr(Y) isotopes (LANL 1982).

40|$|A {{continuum}} {{formulation of}} spreading resistance <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> {{is derived from}} the Choo et al. recursion relation for the kernel of the spread-ing resistance <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> integral. Specifically, a differential equation for the kernel of the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> integral is derived in the limit as the layer thickness approaches zero. The resulting differential equation is non-l inear and inhomogeneous but can be transformed into a l inear second order equation which can be solved analytically in several cases. The continuum form of the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> is compared with the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> generated from the finite-layer thickness version of the Laplace equation description for the case of an exponential ly varying resistivity. Depending upon the number of layers used, the exponential constant, and the total thickness of the structure, the continuum and discrete forms of the <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> differ by factors as large as 2. 75 thus indicating a limitation in the accuracy of finite layer algorithms for spreading resistance data interpretation...|$|R

The present <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> were found to overestimate actual moisture content by 0. 6 to 4. 5 percent moisture content. A new table of <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> has been generated for both black spruce and jack pine. Implications of applying this new <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> in industry are also discussed.

40|$|We {{present a}} three {{dimensional}} radiative transfer model {{to examine the}} effects of resonance line scattering in the post-shock flow behind a non-radiative supernova remnant shock. For a rippled shock front viewed edge-on, line scattering significantly reduces the observed flux of C IV λ 1549 and N V λ 1240, two important diagnostic lines in the ultraviolet spectra of supernova remnants. The <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> (defined to be the ratio of the line flux that would be observed neglecting scattering, to the actual observed line flux) is a function of position within the filament. For sufficiently large regions that include crisp edges as well as more diffuse regions of the filament structure, the C IV and N V <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> are between about 1. 5 and 3. 5 (and the C IV <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> is invariably larger than the N V <b>correction</b> <b>factor).</b> The <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> have a larger range when smaller regions are considered. The C IV <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> is about 6 at the filament edges, while the N V <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> is about 4. These simulations of resonance line scattering will be useful for the analysis of supernova remnant shock spectra...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} study was to compare the performance of a universal <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> with transporter‐based <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> in correcting underestimation of CL b. The apparent in vitro CL b of a training set of 21 compounds was determined using the SCH model and extrapolated to apparent in vivo CL b (CL b, app). A universal <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> (10. 2) was obtained by a linear regression of the predicted CL b, app and observed in vivo CL b of training set compounds and applied to an independent test set (n = 20); the corrected CL b predictions of 13 compounds were within twofold error of observed values. Furthermore, two transporter‐based <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> (Organic anion transporting polypeptides/multidrug‐resistance‐related protein 2 and diffusion/P‐glycoprotein) were estimated by linear regression analysis of training set compounds. The applications of the two <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> to the test set resulted in improved prediction precision. In conclusion, both the universal <b>correction</b> <b>factor</b> and transporter‐based <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> provided reasonable <b>corrections</b> of CL b values, which are often underestimated by the SCH model. The use of transporter‐based <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> resulted in an even greater improvement of predictions for compounds with intermediate‐to‐high CL b values. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 102 : 2837 – 2850, 201...|$|R

40|$|An {{existing}} {{rain gauge}} catch correction method addressing {{solid and liquid}} precipitation was applied both as monthly mean <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> based on a 30 yr climatology (<b>standard</b> <b>correction)</b> and as daily <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> based on daily observations of wind speed and temperature (dynamic correction). The two methods resulted in different winter precipitation rates for the period 1990 &ndash; 2010. The resulting precipitation data sets were evaluated through the comprehensive Danish National Water Resources model (DK-Model) revealing major differences in both model performance and optimized model parameter sets. Simulated stream discharge is improved significantly when introducing a dynamic precipitation correction, whereas the simulated hydraulic heads and multi-annual water balances performed similarly due to recalibration adjusting model parameters to compensate for input biases. The resulting optimized model parameters are much more physically plausible for the model based on dynamic correction of precipitation. A proxy-basin test where calibrated DK-Model parameters were transferred to another region without site specific calibration showed better performance for parameter values based on the dynamic correction. Similarly, the performances of the dynamic correction method were superior when considering two single years with a much dryer and a much wetter winter, respectively, {{as compared to the}} winters in the calibration period (differential split-sample tests). We conclude that dynamic precipitation correction should be carried out for studies requiring a sound dynamic description of hydrological processes and it is of particular importance when using hydrological models to make predictions for future climates when the snow/rain composition will differ from the past climate. This conclusion is expected to be applicable for mid to high latitudes especially in coastal climates where winter precipitation type (solid/liquid) fluctuate significantly causing climatological mean <b>correction</b> <b>factors</b> to be inadequate...|$|R
