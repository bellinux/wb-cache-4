40|$|Abstract: Since wood is porous {{it also is}} a good {{heat and}} <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> <b>material.</b> Puffing the cell wall may lose certain level of {{mechanical}} properties but would increase its insulation properties. In this study, Trema orientalis wood was first treated with nitric acid aqueous solution to damage the S 3 layer of cell walls, followed by puffing the cell wall inward with saturated urea and ZnCl 2 solutions. Results indicated that treating Trema orientalis with 10 % nitric acid at 100 oC for 20 minute damaged the S 3 layer of cell walls, and the subsequent treatment with urea and ZnCl 2 saturated solutions caused the fiber tracheid walls to swell up to 76 %. Then, the swollen material was dried with critical CO 2 fluid to obtain puffed wood. SEM examinations of nitric acid-treated samples showed that lignin were removed from the S 3 layer surfaces and S 3 mirofibrils were ruptured causing the entire secondary walls to swell inward...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWith {{the growing}} {{interest}} for sound absorbing materials, research {{is brought to}} optimize porous material whose acoustic absorption coefficient should to remain large across a broad frequency range. Embedding rigid inclusions in a porous plate can enhance its acoustical properties and create an efficient <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> <b>material</b> for low frequencies. The excitation of additional acoustic modes when periodic arrangements of inclusions are used can lead to enhanced acoustic energy dissipation due to the viscous and thermal effects in the material pores when the wavelength is comparable with the radius of the inclusions. By acting {{on the characteristics of}} individual cells (periodicity, shape, type [...] .), it is possible to combine absorption related to the medium with additional resonant effects at low frequencies. A parametric study is performed {{in order to determine the}} influence of the geometry, orientation and resonance frequency of infinitely rigid inclusions embedded in a porous plate.

40|$|Life Cycle Assessment {{procedures}} {{are being used}} more and more by designers and consultants {{in the evaluation of}} the overall environmental impacts of a building throughout its entire life ("from cradle to grave"). Though many studies have demonstrated that the highest impacts of a building are due to its space heating, air-conditioning and electrical consumption, the impacts due to the construction phase and therefore the choice of materials are not negligible. The University of Perugia is carrying out a research, funded by the Italian Ministry for Environment, {{on the role of the}} building sector on greenhouse gas emissions; within this research, data on building materials is being collected and methodologies are being tested to help spread the knowledge of LCA procedures in Italy.

40|$|Slag wool is {{the most}} {{expensive}} and valuable product of blast furnace slag processing. Slag wool is in great demand nowadays. The article highlights the factors influencing the mineral wool quality: chemical composition that determines the acidity of the module, the temperature of the molten slag and the required slag jet thickness consistency. Mineral wool is produced by blowing air or steam into a jet of molten slag. As a result of it the slag crushes into droplets stretching. The resulting wool contains 5 % slag and 95 % air. The quality of the obtained slag wool depends on the module acidity of the slag. The blast furnace slags of «Ilyich iron and steel works of Mariupol» and «Azovstal iron & steel works» are the main (short) slags – they give short fibers. To obtain high-quality long fiber wool it is necessary to add admixtures into basic blast furnace slag to reduce its basicity. As a result of the fuel and energy rising prices and the necessity to reduce the slag wool cost it is necessary to develop a new technology with fiery-liquid slag, with the removal of iron compounds and sulphur from the melts and the introduction of corrective additives {{to improve the quality of}} slag wool. Good thermal conductivity (about 0, 03 kcal/m∙h∙°C) and other indicators (resistance, volume weight) make it possible to use the materials from slag wool (pads, rigid and semi-rigid plates) as heat and <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> <b>material...</b>|$|E
40|$|New {{developments}} in architectural free form shaped buildings {{lead to the}} design of liquid filled multilayer membranes as a façade construction [1]. The water between the membranes can collect or radiate heat or cold from the façade and transfers it to and from the building services system. In the design competition 2 ̆ 2 Create a Barrier of Silence 2 ̆ 2 by Schiphol airport, the design-team 2 ̆ 2 Silent Blue 2 ̆ 2 has presented a noise barrier that implemented the multilayer membranes filled with water as a roof and wall structure [2]. In this design the water inside the membranes is also used as a <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> <b>material.</b> In the context of the barrier design competition, a sound reduction of 20 dB was required in the 31. 5 Hz octave band for the attenuation of ground noise by airplanes. A new laboratory test setup was created and sound insulation measurements of liquids have been performed by Rodrigues and Coutinho [3]. The presented results showed a promising use of water as a sound insulating material; however the absolute results may not be reliable due to limitations of the small measurement setup. To obtain the sound insulation values for a wider frequency range, a laboratory measurement has been performed on a 10 m 2 water layer with a average thickness of 26, 44 and 83 mm in accordance with ISO 140 - 3 [4]. The measurement setup and results from this measurement are presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Research and {{practice}} {{have shown that}} alongside with the natural fibres used in textiles {{they can also be}} used successfully as composite reinforcements, compounds of building materials, as heat and sound insulation materials. Fibre slabs as well as three-dimensional pressed parts can be produced for application in the construction and furniture industry. The main raw materials are aerobically aged hemp stalks. The samples are made of hemp chips, fastened together using the UF and PF glue. The use of preserved chopped hemp to produce slabs allows using all the stalks and also the leaves and seeds without waiting for their full maturity. That makes harvesting of the raw material independent of the weather. The material can be stored compactly, decreasing changes in the properties of the material, significantly shortening the recycling period and accordingly reducing the energy demand and simplifying the technological process. Research was done to find an innovative production technology of a heat and <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> <b>material</b> to be used in construction. During the research a technology was created for a mixture of hemp which involved finding an optimal mulching degree of the hemp stalks, testing the best suited glue (including natural glues) for this operation, testing the impact of the slab thickness on the quality parameters –sound (not described in this article) and heat insulation. The hemp mass for the slab was created from two components – wet (fermented) and dry mass to get a certain degree of moisture. To achieve this result, hemp was cut in the flowering stage, which gave certain advantages, e. g., lower energy consumption and reduced risk of hemp harvesting...|$|E

40|$|Availability of low-frequency {{characteristics}} of <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> elements {{is required in}} order to achieve efficient control of noise sources and reduced level of annoyance in the low-frequency range. Previous work by the author has addressed the problem of designing an enhanced calculation environment for the estimation of sound Transmission Loss (TL). In this work, numerical prediction of TL of <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> structures is performed using a procedure, which is in compliance with the ISO recommendations for acoustic measurements. The room-structure-room finite element representation, employed to solve sound propagation and sound-structure interaction problems, as well as the dynamic coupling of and the sound energy propagation through successive air-structure layers are investigated. Several cases of single-layered plain structures of common <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> <b>materials</b> such as steel, glass and aluminium with various thickness values are modelled and the calculated TL is compared with published experimental results. It is shown that although the detailed dynamic response of the structures is not accurately predicted due to uncertain parameters, such as the test-specimens dimension and vaguely known boundary conditions, the octave band averaged TL is sufficiently predicted {{for the majority of the}} tested materials. Extension of the method to multi-layered structures is attempted and discrepancies at low frequencies are depicted. Finally, the effect of poor mode distribution of the measurement rooms upon the estimated TL is examined in focus. Comparison is performed between TL values calculated with typical and intensely modified transmission rooms. The low-frequency improvement on measurements, when the second ones are used, is demonstrated. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Active {{noise control}} is a topic of {{increasing}} interest for car manufacturers. In the lower fre-quency range, active control could relax the need for <b>sound</b> <b>insulating</b> <b>materials,</b> leading to lighter vehicles with lower fuel consumption. Here, we investigate further {{the possibility of using}} multiple loudspeakers with the aim of enlarging the spatial zones where sufficient noise suppression is achieved. A model-based Linear Quadratic design of a linear multiple-output feedforward regulator is used to approximate known noise paths to multiple measurement po-sitions by the combined secondary paths from the control loudspeakers. The attainable perfor-mance depends on the number and positioning of the control loudspeakers. Tools are needed for predicting and understanding the structural constraints on the attainable performance of the active control system. A measure of reproducibility of the primary paths between a noise source and a control area by a set of control loudspeakers has been investigated here. It uses the concept of an effective rank of the control system. With a given constellation of loudspeak-ers, the contribution of each loudspeaker to the possible attenuation of a disturbance has been analysed and the relationship between the reproducibility of the primary path and the achieved attenuation explored. The insights gained may result in a tool to help car manufacturers placing loudspeakers with both sound reproduction and active noise control in mind. 1...|$|R
