40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>sharing</b> {{capacities}} {{have attracted}} attention {{from a number}} of fields of social cognition and have been variously defined and analyzed in numerous studies. <b>Social</b> <b>sharing</b> consists in the subjective awareness that aspects of the self’s experience are held in common with other individuals.

25|$|According to Rimé, if the <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> {{experience}} is a pleasant one, it could help to strengthen socio-affective links between the two people.

In one study, 83% of the participants reported some degree of secondary <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> in response to both positive and negative emotional situation, with no differences found between these two valences.

In collaboration with a leading career and education online platform, we conducted a large-scale randomized experiment of digital nudging using website popups. Grounding on the Social Capital Theory and the individual motivation mechanism, we proposed and tested four kinds of nudging messages: simple request, monetary incentive, relational capital, and cognitive capital. We find that nudging messages with monetary incentive, relational and cognitive capital framings lead to increase in <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> behavior, while nudging message with simple request decreases <b>social</b> <b>sharing,</b> comparing to the control group without nudging. This study contributes to the prior research on digital nudging by providing causal evidence of effective nudging for online <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> behavior.

25|$|The first {{empirical}} research about the <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> of emotions {{was conducted in}} 1991. These were retrospective studies where participants filled out a questionnaire which asked them to recall a specific personal experience that provoked an emotion. They then {{were asked to respond}} to questions related to their <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> behaviors related to that event. In all of these studies, 88–96% of emotional experiences were followed by <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> of those experiences at least one time.|$|R
25|$|Similar to the {{problems}} of a restricted educational background, the subjects of the first studies on the <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> of emotions were limited to Belgian and French populations. While later studies conducted in Netherlands, Italy, and Spain produced similar results to the first studies, the question of whether <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> exists in non-Western cultures. The first intercultural study compared Dutch subjects to Turkish and Surinamese immigrants, and the findings showed that <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> was a prominent behavior in each group, although slightly less so for the Surinamese subjects. Other studies comparing Western and Eastern cultures produced similar results, finding that Eastern cultures had slightly lower rates of <b>social</b> <b>sharing.</b> Furthermore, several general qualitative differences were found between Western and Eastern populations. On average, Western subjects shared an emotional event more often (5–6 times) than Asian subjects (2–3 times). There was also a longer delay between the emotional event and the <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> for Asian groups than for Western ones.|$|R
40|$|Emotional {{events are}} {{followed}} by recurrent thoughts (i. e., mental rumination), {{and talking about the}} event (i. e., <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> of emotion). Factors that can account for variations in these consequences were examined (i. e., emotional intensity, the Five Factor Model, and two factors of alexithymia). In two samples, participants reported the most negative emotional event of the last months and in one sample also the most positive one. Results indicated that emotional intensity predicted <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> and mental rumination, while neuroticism was positively related to intrusive thoughts about negative events, and extraversion to mental rumination and <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> about positive events. Difficulty describing feelings was negatively related to <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> for negative events and reduced fantasy to mental rumination for positive events...|$|R
25|$|From {{the above}} {{evidence}} {{it can be}} concluded that exposure to the <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> of an emotion is itself an emotion-eliciting event, it would follow that the listener too would later share that experience with other people. Christophe et Rimé called this subsequent phenomenon secondary <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> of emotions. In other words, the receiver of the <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> will consequently experience some kind of emotion, so the receiver will then become a transmitter of the narration as a part of their emotional experience of hearing the story.|$|R

A large proportion of initiation expressions were found to conform to full SSE, with negative emotion posts outnumbering bivalent and positive posts.

2500|$|<b>Social</b> <b>sharing</b> {{behaviors}} incite a socio-affective dynamic {{between the}} involved persons {{and according to}} several studies, may produce interpersonal benefits, and this can result in further social integration. Humans have long been aware of such processes, and have been using and even exploiting {{them for a long}} time. [...] A particularly prominent example of such purposeful collective <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> is the celebration or commemoration of collective events (such as war victories and defeats or natural disasters), ceremonies, symbols, symbolic characters or stories, etc. [...] According to Frijda, such collective instances of <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> are created for similar reasons to those for individual instances; the event has not been fully integrated into the lives of the participants. For collective <b>social</b> <b>sharing,</b> this may mean that the emotions elicited by the event are reactivated in the people who actually experienced the event, or that the emotional event is being reproduced for successive generations who did not actually experience the event because the event represents an important memory of the group. Following this idea, the collective rituals and symbols are linkened to conventional <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> situations, which both cause a reactivation of the emotions that were lived or relived.|$|R

In this case, these differences could reflect the extent of social networking typically seen in each culture. In an individualistic culture, this social networking is more diversified than in the collectivistic cultures, where family is generally the center of the network. Additionally, these differences could reflect the closeness of the interpersonal relationships in collectivistic cultures, where it can be difficult for individuals to recognize when the <b>social</b> <b>sharing</b> occurs because they are so often together.|$|R
