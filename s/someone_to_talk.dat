500|$|Jackson's biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, {{has stated}} that the video is based on Jackson's real life. He used to walk alone at night looking for new friends, even {{at the peak of}} his musical popularity. The 1980s saw him become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room {{sometimes}} and cry. It's so hard to make friends... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to. But I just end up coming home." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{previous}} album Off the Wall (1979) received strong {{critical acclaim}} {{and was also}} a commercial success, eventually selling over 20 million copies worldwide. The years between Off the Wall and Thriller were a transitional period for Jackson, a time of increased independence. The period saw the singer become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends ... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to. But I just end up coming home." [...] When Jackson turned 21 in August 1979, he hired John Branca as his manager.|$|E

Joseph {{said he wanted to}} teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep. For a number of years afterward, Jackson suffered nightmares about being kidnapped from his bedroom. By the early 1980s, he was deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, [...] "Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to. But I just end up coming home." ...|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{a monster}} buddy for the lead monster emerged at an April 6, 1998 [...] "story summit" [...] in Burbank with {{employees}} from Disney and Pixar. A term coined by Lasseter, a [...] "story summit" [...] was a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in only two days. Such a character, the group agreed, would give the lead monster <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to about his predicament. Development artist Ricky Nierva drew a concept sketch of a rounded, one-eyed monster as a concept for the character, and everyone was generally receptive to it. Docter named the character Mike for the father of his friend Frank Oz, a director and Muppet performer. Jeff Pidgeon and Jason Katz story-boarded a test in which Mike helps Sulley choose a tie for work, and Mike Wazowski soon became a vital character in the film. Originally, Mike had no arms and had to use his legs as appendages; however, due to some technical difficulties, arms were soon added to him.|$|E
500|$|While Marlon would {{correspond}} with and eventually marry his wife Carol at 18, Michael never {{had sex with}} groupies, finding his brothers' behavior toward women disgusting. In addition to not touching groupies, Jackson reportedly never {{had an interest in}} having any type of sex as a youngster. In one alleged incident, when he was 15 years old, a male family member arranged for two prostitutes to take his virginity. They were told to [...] "work him over", before being locked in a room with him. Instead Michael picked up a Bible and read bible verses to the girls. The girls left in tears. James McField, who worked with The Jackson 5, stated that the lead singer of the band often needed <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with. It was at these times that women would be introduced to him for companionship. McField asserted that he never witnessed anything sexual, and that such females were not Jackson's type; [...] "He liked nice girls, pure girls who appeared to have no street background." ...|$|E
500|$|They find a small structure, {{and from}} its top the woman spots people. As {{they leave the}} structure, they think of their sand castle, {{wondering}} about its fate. The screen flashes to a scene of a lone bucket floating on a body of water, then flashes back. After a bit more traveling, the characters make contact with three androgynous people wearing headgear. The woman attempts to communicate, but the native language of the people is incomprehensible. She shows them her wound, and they treat it with a paste. The group then beckon {{the man and woman}} to follow them into town. After receiving water, the man and woman sleep. The following morning, the man communicates with one of the locals by drawing pictures in the dirt. The local informs that the sea level is, in fact, rising, and that the two characters should follow and see <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to. They rest while on the way, where the man and woman look over a map from one of the locals. They continue to a city, and a castle behind it. They are led to the natives' leader, who, speaking the language of the protagonists poorly, explains the reason for the sea rising. She reveals that her people had erected a berm to keep what she calls [...] "the planet's mightiest river" [...] at bay, which is presently days away from breaking through and flooding the man and woman's home. She explains that the journey back to reach their home to warn the others living there would take too long and that they {{have no choice but to}} remain with the mountain people. Ignoring her, the man and woman flee and run back home, taking some of the mountain people's provisions on the way out and guiding themselves with maps that the woman had stolen.|$|E

2500|$|Despite being {{advised by}} their governments not {{to travel to}} Lockerbie, many of the passengers' relatives, most {{of them from the}} US, arrived there within days to {{identify}} the dead. Volunteers from Lockerbie set up and staffed canteens, which stayed open 24 hours a day and offered relatives, soldiers, police officers, and social workers free sandwiches, hot meals, coffee, and <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to. The people of the town washed, dried, and ironed every piece of clothing that was found once the police had determined they were of no forensic value, so that as many items as possible could be returned to the relatives. The BBC's Scotland correspondent, Andrew Cassell, reported on the 10th anniversary of the bombing that the townspeople had [...] "opened their homes and hearts" [...] to the relatives, bearing their own losses [...] "stoically and with enormous dignity", and that the bonds forged then continue to this day.|$|E
2500|$|The Rankin-Bass production, which spells {{the title}} with an ampersand, truncates {{much of the}} story (it ran in a one-hour time slot) and {{simplifies}} some of the motivations, but its major alterations are setting up the hearing over the Mantle of Immortality as a frame story explaining just why Claus (J. D. Roth/Earl Hammond) deserves the mantle, although there is an edit {{that makes it difficult}} to realize that the scene in which Ak (Alfred Drake) calls the council when first finding the infant in the woods does not occur in the same time period as the main story. In addition, Shiegra accompanies Claus to the Laughing Valley, in which, unlike the book, it is always Winter. A similar compromise toward popular culture is Claus's now eight reindeer, albeit unnamed. Peter Knook, a rather crusty but amiable fellow, replaces most of the other Knooks, save the Protector (King) and two strangers, and declares [...] "only on Christmas Eve" [...] for the reindeer without any argument or explanation. One important new character, Tingler, a Sound Imp (Robert McFadden) also accompanies Claus and gives him <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, Davis {{created a}} comic strip called Gnorm Gnat, which met with little success. One editor said, [...] "his art was good, his gags were great," [...] but that [...] "nobody can {{identify}} with Bugs." [...] Davis {{decided to take a}} long, hard look at the comics and he saw that dogs were doing very well, but there were no cats at the time. Davis figured that since he had grown up on a farm with 25 cats that he could come up with a strip based on a cat. He then proceeded to create a new strip with a cat as its main character and thus created Garfield, who borrows the first letter of his name from Davis's earlier work. Garfield originally consisted of four main characters. Garfield, the titular character, was based on the cats Davis was around growing up; he took his name and personality from Davis's grandfather, James A. Garfield Davis, who was, in Davis's words, [...] "a large, cantankerous man". Jon Arbuckle came from a 1950s coffee commercial, and Odie was based on a car dealership commercial written by Davis, which featured Odie the Village Idiot. Early on in the strip, Odie's owner was a man named Lyman. He was written in to give Jon <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with. Davis later realized that Garfield and Jon could [...] "communicate nonverbally". The strip, originally centered on Jon, was first rejected by the King Features, Post-Hall and the Chicago Tribune-New York News agencies, all of which asked Davis to focus on the cat, who in their opinion, got the better lines. United Feature Syndicate accepted the retooled strip in 1978 and debuted it in 41newspapers on June 19 of that year (however, after a test run, the Chicago Sun-Times dropped it, only to reinstate it after readers' complaints). Garfields first Sunday page ran on June 25, 1978, being featured as a third-pager until March 22, 1981. A half-page debuted the following Sunday, March 29, with the strips for March 14 and 21, 1982, having a unique nine-panel format, but UFS curtailed further use of it (it did, however, [...] allow Davis to use the format for his U.S. Acres strip).|$|E
