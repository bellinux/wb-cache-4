Watson with a pistol {{to get him to}} leave the studio but Watson alleged that he also menaced him with it on the <b>street.</b> <b>Charges</b> against Grabill for assault, filed by Watson, were {{dismissed}} as well as a larceny charge against Watson by Grabill but Grabill was put under bonds in the sum of $100 to keep the peace and taxed $20 costs. Grabill was also fined $1 and $24 costs for carrying concealed weapons on a complaint made by Watson. He was in a fight on Main Street with two of his former employees, George Winchester and W. R. Locke. He was the victim of a theft by a man named Hilton. The article alleges that various things, such as photographic prints were stolen from the studio. While Grabill was in Hot Springs three of his employees, Mr. Rogan, Hugh Callaly and Sadie Clayton, quit. He telegraphed Marshall Garr to take charge of the Gallery quickly, alleging that these people were stealing from him. Marshall Garr closed the studio but under orders from Justice Hall to satisfy a fine and costs of $25 he closed it and placed Joseph Richardson there to guard it.|$|E
50|$|There is {{currently}} a collaboration between NRG Energy, Inc. and AT&T to implement <b>Street</b> <b>Charge</b> units throughout New York City, which will each offer six USB ports in total. This project will cost around $300,000-500,000. As of 2013 there was a controversy surrounding <b>Street</b> <b>Charge</b> appliances in {{that there were no}} plans implemented to protect appliances and users utilizing the device. The concern was that the wiring might be modified by malicious users to steal or wipe data from devices plugged into the device.|$|R

50|$|In late March 2010, Clergy Voice sent {{another letter}} to the IRS asserting that {{residents}} at C Street failed {{to pay taxes on}} the allegedly discounted portions of their allegedly below market rents. Clergy Voice stated that a one-bedroom apartment on Capitol Hill would cost at least $1,700, while rent at the C Street house for members has been $950 a month including housekeeping services, and thus the renters should pay income tax on the difference. The group also surveyed the Capitol Hill rental market and found that nearby hotels charge a minimum of $2,400 per month and corporate housing costs a minimum of $4,000 per month. In 2002, the Los Angeles Times reported that C <b>Street</b> <b>charged</b> Senators and Congressional representatives $600 per month for rent. In 2009, WORLD Magazine report that C <b>Street</b> <b>charged</b> about $950 per month for rent.|$|R

2500|$|The cost {{of parking}} in many {{upgraded}} car parks can be deducted from the CashCard inserted in the IU of the vehicle, thus {{eliminating the need for}} the car park to have an attendant. [...] Although the {{cost of parking}} (which is published) is variable, parking costs tend to be much less expensive compared to London and New York. For example, the Centrepoint shopping centre charges a mere S$1 (approximately US$0.70) for the first hour, whereas garages in New York on Fifth Avenue and 57th <b>Street</b> <b>charge</b> between US$12 and US$26 for one hour.|$|R
50|$|The early {{chapters}} of Silent War (released in October 2009, January 2010, and March 2010) depicted chaotic, youth-driven protests on Wall Street {{and are now}} considered prescient of the Occupy Wall Street movement that began in September 2011. The protest scenes were illustrated by Muckcracker in mid-2011 as flashbacks in the comic book Godkiller: Tomorrow's Ashes - Spiderland and bear an uncanny resemblance to Occupy imagery. Pizzolo talked to Bleeding Cool about how the images of violent street protest, including a lynching of the Wall <b>Street</b> <b>Charging</b> Bull, were not widely considered predictive {{at the time of}} their initial release.|$|R

40|$|The {{attention}} the electric car receives as a promising means of sustainable transportation seems {{at times to}} overshadow the rise of that other electric vehicle: the pedelec or electric bicycle. For those who don't know yet: a pedelec is a bicycle assisted by an electric motor. That motor {{is powered by a}} rechargeable (lithium-ion) battery. The motor is intended to assist pedaling, not to replace it. It is the newest evolution of the bike. Its numbers are growing fast. This paper assumes that the growing use of pedelecs requires a different approach from design research and policy making towards electric two wheelers. It will outline the major differences between regular bike use and pedelec use and addresses issues like city to city cycling, bicycle theft, parking and <b>street</b> <b>charging.</b> UrbanismArchitectur...|$|R

40|$|The {{simplest}} {{solution to}} electrification of the drivetrain {{is to remove}} {{the internal combustion engine}} (ICE). Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) operate on electricity only and the main components are primarily a high voltage (HV) battery, an electric motor and a motor controller. The distance driven in charge depleting (CD) mode is classified as the all electric range (AER). An intermediate step in electrification of the vehicle drivetrain is the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). Electric mobility offers an opportunity for diversification of the primary energy sources used in transport but also brings new risks, technological challenges and commercial imperatives. Based on the location, the charging infrastructure is classified as residential or commercial. Public charging infrastructures, including central charging stations for large car parks and <b>street</b> <b>charging</b> stations, are starting to be installed in large numbers to help the deployment of EVs and address the customer's ‘range anxiety’...|$|R

[...] "If you observe {{the tail of the}} bull, the tail is spirally pointing to the sky, meaning a uplifting financial trend," [...] he said. The bull had been commissioned to be twice the size of Wall <b>Street's</b> <b>Charging</b> Bull. The city also requested a bull that was younger and stronger than New York City's bull to symbolise [...] "the energy of Shanghai's economy", Zhou Wei, the head of Huangpu district said.
