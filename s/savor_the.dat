25|$|In its {{depiction}} of violence, Leone used his signature long drawn and close-up style of filming, {{which he did}} by mixing extreme face shots and sweeping long shots. By doing so, Leone managed to stage epic sequences punctuated by extreme eyes and face shots, or hands slowly reaching on a holstered gun. This builds up the tension and suspense by allowing the viewers to <b>savor</b> <b>the</b> performances and character reactions, create a feel of excitement, as well as giving Leone the freedom to film beautiful landscapes. Leone also incorporated music to heighten up the tension and pressure {{before and during the}} film's many gunfights.|$|E

500|$|Blitz {{described}} Hal as [...] "lost in {{the mystery}} of love" [...] and he [...] "loved {{the idea that a}} kid who is lost when he's confronted by love and sex would be saddled with the name Hal Hefner", an homage to Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. Throughout the film, Hal is seen to be surrounded by sex and relationships—titlecards for the seasons of the year are placed over images of kissing students; Hal listens to his mother having intercourse with her new boyfriend; his friend Lewis shows Hal images from the Kama Sutra; while Lewis's parents attempt to mend their relationship through music therapy—but the adults in the film were written to be similarly confused and frustrated with love. [...] "In a world where all the children are trying so hard to be like adults", according to Stylus Yannick LeJacq, [...] "the adults are all sullenly try to reenact their childhood, taking every chance to ignore their children and <b>savor</b> <b>the</b> meaningless void of leisure time." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{his young}} age, Middleton was {{required}} to complete a year of preparatory school before being enrolled in the four-year program at Mississippi A In essence he did a final {{year of high school}} while living in the dormitory and following the regimen of the students at the college. [...] The students were treated like cadets at a military academy, marching to and from all meals, and beginning their day with the first bugle call at 5:30a.m. Every week day was the same: cleanup and study time in the morning, march to breakfast, a usually short chapel call, classes from 8:30 to 4:00, broken only by lunch, athletics from 4:00 to 6:30p.m., dinner, and then study from 7:30 to 10:00p.m., followed by the playing of taps at 10:30, and lights out at 10:40. While Middleton did not particularly <b>savor</b> <b>the</b> military atmosphere, he settled into the routine, and the year passed quickly. [...] The highlight of his preparatory year came on 10 February 1905 when John Philip Sousa brought his band to A, attracting people from around the state, and packing the 2000-seat mess hall. The train that would take the band to its next stop was held up for over an hour as the concert was extended by repeated calls for encores.|$|E
500|$|The review {{aggregator}} website Comic Book Roundup {{reported a}} 7.3 out of 10 average rating for the event, based on 270 critic reviews. Just before {{the release of}} the final part, Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated, [...] ""Trinity War" [...] itself seems almost wholly disinterested in the Trinity of Sin, the Seven Deadly Sins, {{or any of the other}} elements the crossover was initially predicated upon." [...] After Justice League #23 was released, Schedeen added,"Event comics often fail because they're more concerned with setting up a new status quo and changing the playing field than simply allowing readers to <b>savor</b> <b>the</b> high stakes and epic nature of the conflict at hand. [...] "Trinity War" [...] may well emerge as the new poster child for everything wrong with that approach. In the end, [...] "Trinity War" [...] becomes little more than a stepping stone towards Forever Evil. The result is that Justice League #23 is an almost wholly unfulfilling [...] "finale" [...] issue." [...] Overall, Newsarama's Richard Gray praised the storytelling, with the event [...] "cleverly weaving in threads set up two years ago in all related titles." [...] However, Gray was somewhat critical of the fact that [...] "the last panel of “Trinity War” leads directly into “Forever Evil”, effectively making this one big event that begets another. It’s a crime that both major syndicates are repeatedly guilty of these last few years, one so commonplace that it is increasingly difficult to take umbrage with a singular instance anymore." [...] Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza felt [...] "there are no true conclusions of any sort" [...] after the whole event, [...] "just more shock-for-shock's sake moments and lots of new questions" [...] added at the end of Justice League #23. As with Gray, Zawisza [...] "was hopeful DC's tactic of bleeding events one to the next would be over following the relaunch, but this issue proves – without an inkling of doubt – that that is simply not the case." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{raved about}} Carey {{performance}} following {{the completion of}} the ceremony, with Jon Pareles from The New York Times saying [...] "once she was worked up, she moaned, growled and swooped to the high and low extremes of her voice in [...] "Fly Like a Bird". A writer from USA Today complimented her recital of both songs, writing [...] "Carey certainly earned the right to <b>savor</b> <b>the</b> spotlight this year. But the diva made room for Walker's booming baritone in 'Bird', her fluttering homage to Minnie Ripperton." [...] Gary Susman from Entertainment Weekly called Carey the [...] "comeback queen" [...] and wrote [...] "Its what her voice did, soaring into the rafters like only Carey's can." [...] Roger Friedman from Fox News outed the performance as [...] "the number that sent the audience into a frenzy". On April9,2008, reality competition American Idol aired its second annual charity event, titled Idol Gives Back. Backed up by Randy Jackson on the bass, Carey appeared on stage as the last head-lining performer of the evening. Midway through the performance, a large church choir walked on stage in blue garbs, and provided the gospel climax for the song. Ann Powers from the Los Angeles Times called the song an [...] "inspirational show-stopper" [...] and felt Carey's vocal's were [...] "patented impossible notes". In regards to the performance, Katie Byrne from MTV News wrote [...] "Carey was at her over-the-top best, with a full gospel choir and the high notes that made her famous." [...] Aside from several televised performances, Carey included [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] on the set-lists of all her tours following its release. During Carey's The Adventures of Mimi Tour (2006) stop at Madison Square Garden, the song was dedicated to Ol' Dirty Bastard, who died in 2004 from an accidental drug overdose. The performance had to be re-done, as Carey's pastor, Clarence Keaton, missed his cue for the Biblical verses, and was forced to be found backstage and ushered to the spotlight. Four years later, Carey performed the song throughout her Angels Advocate Tour, only dedicating it to Keaton, who died on July3,2009. Editor and journalist Thomas Kintner from the Hartford Courant felt that during her live recital of [...] "Fly Like a Bird", Carey [...] "displayed power and sky-scraping pitch".|$|E

Soon the villagers' cottages and fishermen's huts filled to overflowing, and by 1880, 30hotels competed for vacationers' dollars. Tourism was becoming the major industry.|$|E

2500|$|Terpening’s second thriller, League of Shadows (2005), was a {{contemporary}} novel of intrigue with an extensive back story {{that takes place}} in Italy during the Fascist Era. The historical scenes depict the efforts of three spies in 1943 to infiltrate Italian leader Benito Mussolini’s secret police, the OVRA. Decades after that intrigue went horribly wrong, an unknown enemy begins to hunt down the former secret agents, and their one hope for survival is an ex-cop obsessed with his mission. The Midwest Book Review called the novel “an addictive read, weaving together human drive, determination, and betrayal into a gripping whole”, while Lucille Cormier, in The Historical Novels Review, said that “You can race through this suspense thriller riding the whirlwind of drug busts, jungle guerrilla attacks, gun fights, assassinations, and love affairs right into the breathtaking climax. Or, if you are disciplined enough, you can turn each page slowly and <b>savor</b> <b>the</b> extraordinary visual and historical detail Ron Terpening has painted into his complex story. Either way, you are in for a treat. This is a book to add to every collection of historical fiction.” Joel Tscherne (Cleveland Public Library) noted in Library Journal that this is a novel that “fans of Jack Higgins’s thrillers will enjoy.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Vincent {{was also}} spotted mid-air by Deryl Stone, a Chief Ranger for the National Park Service. Stone {{reported}} seeing Vincent grab his parachute after landing and run {{to a nearby}} car, which quickly drove away. However, authorities were able to detain two men on the ground who had been videotaping the jump. Stone said 37-year-old Ronald Carroll and 27-year-old Robert Weinzetl, both St. Louis residents, were found with a wireless communication headset and a video camera, {{as well as a}} still camera with a telephoto lens. The two were also charged with two misdemeanors: disorderly conduct and commercial photography in a national park. Vincent later turned himself in and initially pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. However, he eventually accepted a guilty plea deal in which he testified against Carroll and Weinzetl, revealing that the two consented to recording the jump during a meeting of all three on the day before his stunt occurred. Federal magistrate judge David D. Noce ruled on January 28, 1993, that Carroll had been involved in a conspiracy and was guilty of both misdemeanor charges; the charges against Weinzetl had been dropped by federal attorneys. In his decision, Noce stated, [...] "There are places in our country where the sufficiently skilled can <b>savor</b> <b>the</b> exhilaration and personal satisfaction of accomplishing courageous and intrepid acts, of reaching dreamed-of heights and for coursing dangerous adventures," [...] but added that other places are designed for [...] "the exhilaration of mere observation and for the appreciation of the imaginings and the works of others.

6000|$|The {{pursuit of}} the {{swordfish}} is much more exciting than ordinary fishing, for it resembles the hunting of large animals upon the land and partakes more {{of the nature of}} the chase. There is no slow and careful baiting and patient waiting, and no disappointment caused by the accidental capture of worthless [...] "bait-stealers." [...] The game is seen and followed, and outwitted by wary tactics, and killed by strength of arm and skill. The swordfish is a powerful antagonist sometimes, and sends his pursuers' vessel into harbor leaking, and almost sinking, from injuries he has inflicted. I have known a vessel to be struck by wounded swordfish as many as twenty times in a season. There is even the spice of personal danger to <b>savor</b> <b>the</b> chase, for the men are occasionally wounded by the infuriated fish. One of Captain Ashby's crew was severely wounded by a swordfish which thrust his beak through the oak floor of a boat on which he was standing, and penetrated about two inches in his naked heel. The strange fascination draws men to this pursuit when they have once learned its charms. An old swordfish fisherman, who had followed the pursuit for twenty years, told me that when he was on the cruising-ground, he fished all night in his dreams, and that many a time he has rubbed the skin off his knuckles by striking them against the ceiling of his bunk when he raised his arms to thrust the harpoon into visionary monster swordfishes.|$|E
