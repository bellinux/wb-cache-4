2500|$|Most home hi-fi {{loudspeakers}} use two wiring {{points to}} connect {{to the source of}} the signal (for example, to the audio amplifier or receiver). To accept the wire connection, the loudspeaker enclosure may have binding posts, <b>spring</b> <b>clips,</b> or a panel-mount jack. If the wires for a pair of speakers are not connected with respect to the proper electrical polarity (the + and − connections on the speaker and amplifier should be connected + to + and − to −; [...] speaker cable is almost always marked so that one conductor of a pair can be distinguished from the other, even if it has run under or behind things in its run from amplifier to speaker location), the loudspeakers are said to be [...] "out of phase" [...] or more properly [...] "out of polarity". Given identical signals, motion in one cone is in the opposite direction of the other. This typically causes monophonic material in a stereo recording to be canceled out, reduced in level, and made more difficult to localize, all due to destructive interference of the sound waves. The cancellation effect is most noticeable at frequencies where the loudspeakers are separated by a quarter wavelength or less; low frequencies are affected the most. This type of miswiring error does not damage speakers, but is not optimal for listening.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of agronomic practices on forage production and chemical composition of grass-legume pasture mixture was {{studied at the}} Utah State University Dairy Farm, North Logan, Utah, during spring and summer, 1970. The soil is a well-drained Millville silt loam that has about a 1 percent slope. It is high in potash, phosphorus, and lime, having a pH of 7. 9. Analysis of the clipping management showed that the early <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> decreased the yield of forage. The losses in total yield due to <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> were approximately {{four to five times}} the yields received in early <b>spring</b> <b>clipping.</b> The grasses were affected more than the legumes. The yields of dry forage increased with the increase in fertilizer rates from 0 through 300 pounds of nitrogen per acre. There was no advantage to splitting the nitrogen fertilizer of 300 pounds per acre into three applications. Most of the effects of spring clipp 1 ng and nitrogen fertilization were re fleeted in the first summer harvest. The plots fertilized with nitrogen produced a higher yield and nitrate content than the check plots.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the influence of cutting treatments on the yield and quality of non-irrigated alfalfa in western Oregon. <b>Spring</b> <b>clipping</b> treatments included (1) not clipped, (2) clipped when 6 inches high and (3) clipped when 12 inches high. The hay harvest criteria were (1) near full light interception by the vegetative canopy, (2) crown bud stage and (3) one-tenth bloom stage. Combinations of these criteria included first hay harvest based on light interception followed by either of the other criteria at subsequent harvests, and first harvest based on crown bud development in combination with one-tenth bloom criterion for subsequent harvest. Two alfalfa varieties, Vernal and Du Puits, were subjected {{to each of the}} 18 treatments (6 x 3 in all combinations). Results of one growing season indicated that the influence of <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> was not reflected in yield of dry matter (hay) except at the relatively small third harvest when <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> showed a deleterious effect. The yields obtained by the <b>spring</b> <b>clipping</b> were sufficient to offset the reduction at the third hay harvest. It was observed that the total yields for the season did not differ. Cutting at the one-tenth bloom stage showed an advantage in yield but with a greatly reduced crude protein percentage. Cutting on the basis of nearly complete light interception resulted in harvest at an immature stage in early May and at a very mature stage in late season. Highest yields, with leafiness and crude protein suitable for high quality hay, were obtained by cutting at the crown bud stage throughout the season, or by taking the first harvest on the basis of light interception and subsequent harvests on the basis of either crown buds or one-tenth bloom. The varieties produced approximately the same total for the season. Vernal was slightly leafier than Du Puits at the second and third hay harvests. A highly significant negative correlation was found between yield of dry matter and percentage protein and between yield of dry matter and leaf-stem ratio. The correlation between percentage protein and leaf-stem ratio was significant and positive...|$|R
50|$|Orthodontic {{separators}} (commonly {{known as}} spacers) are rubber bands or metal appliances used in orthodontics. Spacers are placed between the molars {{at the second}} orthodontic appointment, before molar bands are applied. Spacers are either circular rubber bands about a centimeter in diameter placed between top and bottom molars; there may be 1-12 spacers applied or small metal <b>spring</b> <b>clips</b> (spring separators) that push the molars apart. The spacers stay between the teeth for one to two weeks and move the teeth apart slowly until they are far apart enough so that orthodontists can fit a tooth brace or molar band in between them or fit an expander with rubber rings.|$|E
50|$|The spacing {{between the}} clips (lead pitch) is {{typically}} 0.1 in (2.54 mm). Integrated circuits (ICs) in dual in-line packages (DIPs) can be inserted to straddle the {{centerline of the}} block. Interconnecting wires and the leads of discrete components (such as capacitors, resistors, and inductors) can be inserted into the remaining free holes to complete the circuit. Where ICs are not used, discrete components and connecting wires may use any of the holes. Typically the <b>spring</b> <b>clips</b> are rated for 1 ampere at 5 volts and 0.333 amperes at 15 volts (5 watts). The edge of the board has male and female notches so boards can be clipped {{together to form a}} large breadboard.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} process of spacers usually involves stringing floss through the rubber band and placing the spacer between the teeth. Some spacers are small metal <b>spring</b> <b>clips</b> that squeeze the teeth apart. There is some pressure {{throughout the process}} and some soreness after, but overall, the spacer {{application process}} is quite painless, although the patient may immediately start to feel pain from the pressure exerted on the teeth. Sometimes special orthodontic tools are used to stretch open the rubber bands, depending on how crowded the teeth are. If the jaw is especially crowded, the spacers may cause intense constant pain due to the teeth moving closer together. This pain begins a while after placement and usually lasts for several days.|$|E
