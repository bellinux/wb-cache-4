50|$|Dial-up {{access is}} a {{connection}} to the Internet through a phone line, creating a <b>semi-permanent</b> <b>link</b> to the Internet. Operating on a single channel, it monopolizes the phone line and is the slowest method of accessing the Internet. Dial-up is often the only form of Internet access available in rural areas because it requires no infrastructure other than the already existing telephone network. Dial-up connections typically do not exceed a speed of 56 kbit/s, because they are primarily made via a 56k modem.|$|E

40|$|A Virtual Private Network (VPN) {{that exists}} over a public network {{infrastructure}} like the internet is both cheaper and more flexible than a network comprising dedicated <b>semi-permanent</b> <b>links</b> such as leased-lines. In contrast to leased-line private networks, the topology of such a VPN can be altered on-the-fly, and its lightweight nature means that creation and modification can take place over very short timescales. In a programmable networking environment, such VPNs can be enhanced with fine-grained customer control {{right down to the}} level of the physical network resources, allowing a VPN to be employed for almost any conceivable network service. This paper examines some of the issues present in the provision of programmable VPNs. In particular, automated VPN "design" is considered, that is, how a VPN description can be translated to a set of real physical resources that meets customer requirements while also satisfying the goals of the VPN Service Provider (VSP). This problem [...] -the di [...] ...|$|R
