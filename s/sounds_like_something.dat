"Nature Boy" [...] is so otherworldly in its {{melody and}} lyric that {{any number of}} interpretations over the decades, from Nat Cole's to Alex Chilton's, {{have never been able}} to make it ordinary.

Club said, [...] "while her distortion-smudged, guitar-marred Kanye West {{collaboration}} 'Illuminati' is pleasingly confrontational, the song’s lyrical progression is a distracted mess...The result? All {{of these}} shiny party people resemble the Illuminati." [...] Jim Farber of The New York Daily News said West [...] "gave her a dark needling rhythm that <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> {{left over from}} his last album. Its industrial grind clashes badly with Madonna’s soft vocal." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Spin said the song [...] "wastes a potentially explosive, blacklit Kanye beat on a muddled, hashtagging lyric that isn’t even as conspiracy-baiting as it thinks it is". New Zealand Herald's Lydia Jenkin was more critical, writing that it [...] "sounds like a trying-too-hard version of Lady Gaga meets M.I.A.". Similarly, Evan Sawdey of PopMatters said the song [...] "reek of desperation, wanting so badly to shock and offend listeners that [...] fail to resolve as satisfying song first and foremost".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Scherzinger was {{planning}} to launch her debut album under the title Her Name is Nicole, however, the release of four singles, including [...] "Whatever U Like" [...] (featuring T.I.) and [...] "Baby Love" [...] (featuring will.i.am) all failed to significantly impact on US charts. [...] "Baby Love" [...] was moderately successful reaching top-twenty in Europe. After a number of pushbacks, the entire project was scrapped {{at the request of}} Scherzinger. In May 2010, Rap-Up reported that Scherzinger was relaunching her solo career with an [...] "empowering" [...] ballad called [...] "Nobody Can Change Me". The song was recorded in a nighttime studio session while she was competing on season 10 of the U.S. reality competition, Dancing with the Stars, and was mastered on May 23, 2010, ready for its premiere on Ryan Seacrest's KIIS FM radio show the following day. Idolator was unimpressed with the [...] "treacly pop tune" [...] saying that the lack of sexiness, [...] "uninspiring message" [...] and [...] "squeaky vocals" [...] did Scherzinger no favors. However, Amos Barshad of New York magazine actually liked the song, stating that [...] "there’s none of the Pussycat Doll’s forced sexiness here; instead, it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> that could have just missed the final cut on a Kelly Clarkson album (that is sort of supposed to be a compliment, yeah)." ...|$|E

I feel he will be fondly remembered for the next 350 years at least." [...] Cushing, commenting on his role, joked: [...] "I've often wondered what a 'Grand Moff' was.

2500|$|Following Mullen's {{return and}} the sessions' {{resumption}} in February 1996, the production team of Flood, Howie B, and Hooper spent three months attempting to re-work {{much of the}} band's material to better incorporate loops and samples with their musical ideas from 1995. This period was a difficult one; Mullen, in particular, had to record drum parts to replace loops that Howie B had sampled without permission. Flood said, [...] "We took what we had and got the band to play to it and work it into their own idiom, while incorporating a dance ethic... The groove-orientated way of making music can be a trap when there's no song; you end up just plowing along on one riff. So {{you have to try}} to get the groove and the song, and do it so that it sounds like the band, and do it so that it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> new." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cowell {{pursued a}} radical {{compositional}} approach through the mid-1930s, with solo piano pieces remaining {{at the heart}} of his output—important works from this era include The Banshee (1925), requiring numerous playing methods such as pizzicato and longitudinal sweeping and scraping of the strings (...) , and the manic, cluster-filled Tiger (1930), inspired by William Blake's famous poem. Much of Cowell's public reputation continued to be based on his trademark pianistic technique: a critic for the San Francisco News, writing in 1932, referred to Cowell's [...] "famous 'tone clusters,' probably the most startling and original contribution any American has yet contributed to the field of music." [...] A prolific composer of songs (he would write over 180 during his career), Cowell returned in 1930–31 to Aeolian Harp, adapting it as the accompaniment to a vocal setting of a poem by his father, How Old Is Song? He built on his substantial oeuvre of chamber music, with pieces such as the Adagio for Cello and Thunder Stick (1924) that explored unusual instrumentation and others that were even more progressive: Six Casual Developments (1933), for clarinet and piano, <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> Jimmy Giuffre would compose thirty years later. His Ostinato Pianissimo (1934) placed him in the vanguard of those writing original scores for percussion ensemble. He created forceful large-ensemble pieces during this period as well, such as the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (1928)—with its three movements, [...] "Polyharmony," [...] "Tone Cluster," [...] and [...] "Counter Rhythm" [...] (...) —and the Sinfonietta (1928), whose scherzo Anton Webern conducted in Vienna. In the early 1930s, Cowell began to delve seriously into aleatoric procedures, creating opportunities for performers to determine primary elements of a score's realization. One of his major chamber pieces, the Mosaic Quartet (String Quartet No. 3) (1935), is scored as a collection of five movements with no preordained sequence.|$|E

[...] She pushed him outward with her through the door [...] And shut it after her. [...] "Be kind," [...] she said. [...] She took the market things from Warren's arms [...] And set them on the porch, then drew him down [...] To sit {{beside her on the}} wooden steps. [...] "When was I ever {{anything}} but kind to him? [...] But I'll not have the fellow back," [...] he said. [...] "I told him so last haying, didn't I? [...] 'If he left then,' I said, 'that ended it.' [...] What good is he? Who else will harbour him [...] At his age for the little he can do? [...] What help he is there's no depending on. [...] Off he goes always when I need him most. [...] 'He thinks he ought to earn a little pay, [...] Enough at least to buy tobacco with, [...] So he won't have to beg and be beholden.' [...] 'All right,' I say, 'I can't afford to pay [...] Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.' [...] 'Someone else can.' 'Then someone else will have to.' [...] I shouldn't mind his bettering himself [...] If that was what it was. You can be certain, [...] When he begins like that, there's someone at him [...] Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,-- [...] In haying time, when any help is scarce. [...] In winter he comes back to us. I'm done." [...] "Sh! not so loud: he'll hear you," [...] Mary said. [...] "I want him to: he'll have to soon or late." [...] "He's worn out. He's asleep beside the stove. [...] When I came up from Rowe's I found him here, [...] Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep, [...] A miserable sight, and frightening, too-- [...] You needn't smile--I didn't recognise him-- [...] I wasn't looking for him--and he's changed. [...] Wait till you see." [...] "Where did you say he'd been?" [...] "He didn't say. I dragged him to the house, [...] And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke. [...] I tried to make him talk about his travels. [...] Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off." [...] "What did he say? Did he say anything?" [...] "But little." [...] "Anything? Mary, confess [...] He said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me." [...] "Warren!" [...] "But did he? I just want to know." [...] "Of course he did. What would you have him say? [...] Surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man [...] Some humble way to save his self-respect. [...] He added, if you really care to know, [...] He meant to clear the upper pasture, too. [...] That <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> you have heard before? [...] Warren, I wish you could have heard the way [...] He jumbled everything. I stopped to look [...] Two or three times--he made me feel so queer-- [...] To see if he was talking in his sleep. [...] He ran on Harold Wilson--you remember-- [...] The boy you had in haying four years since. [...] He's finished school, and teaching in his college. [...] Silas declares you'll have to get him back. [...] He says they two will make a team for work: [...] Between them they will lay this farm as smooth! [...] The way he mixed that in with other things. [...] He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft [...] On education--you know how they fought [...] All through July under the blazing sun, [...] Silas up on the cart to build the load, [...] Harold along beside to pitch it on." [...] "Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot." [...] "Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream. [...] You wouldn't think they would. How some things linger! [...] Harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him. [...] After so many years he still keeps finding [...] Good arguments he sees he might have used. [...] I sympathise. I know just how it feels [...] To think of the right thing to say too late. [...] Harold's associated in his mind with Latin. [...] He asked me what I thought of Harold's saying [...] He studied Latin like the violin [...] Because he liked it--that an argument! [...] He said he couldn't make the boy believe [...] He could find water with a hazel prong-- [...] Which showed how much good school had ever done him. [...] He wanted to go over that. But most of all [...] He thinks if he could have another chance [...] To teach him how to build a load of hay----" [...] "I know, that's Silas' one accomplishment. [...] He bundles every forkful in its place, [...] And tags and numbers it for future reference, [...] So he can find and easily dislodge it [...] In the unloading. Silas does that well. [...] He takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests. [...] You never see him standing on the hay [...] He's trying to lift, straining to lift himself." [...] "He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be [...] Some good perhaps to someone in the world. [...] He hates to see a boy the fool of books. [...] Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk, [...] And nothing to look backward to with pride, [...] And nothing to look forward to with hope, [...] So now and never any different." [...] Part of a moon was falling down the west, [...] Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills. [...] Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw [...] And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand [...] Among the harp-like morning-glory strings, [...] Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves, [...] As if she played unheard the tenderness [...] That wrought on him beside her in the night. [...] "Warren," [...] she said, [...] "he has come home to die: [...] You needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time." [...] "Home," [...] he mocked gently. [...] "Yes, what else but home? [...] It all depends on what you mean by home. [...] Of course he's nothing to us, any more [...] Than was the hound that came a stranger to us [...] Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail." [...] "Home is the place where, when you have to go there, [...] They have to take you in." [...] "I should have called it [...] Something you somehow haven't to deserve." [...] Warren leaned out and took a step or two, [...] Picked up a little stick, and brought it back [...] And broke it in his hand and tossed it by. [...] "Silas has better claim on us you think [...] Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles [...] As the road winds would bring him to his door. [...] Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day. [...] Why didn't he go there? His brother's rich, [...] A somebody--director in the bank." [...] "He never told us that." [...] "We know it though." [...] "I think his brother ought to help, of course. [...] I'll see to that if there is need. He ought of right [...] To take him in, and might be willing to-- [...] He may be better than appearances. [...] But have some pity on Silas. Do you think [...] If he'd had any pride in claiming kin [...] Or anything he looked for from his brother, [...] He'd keep so still about him all this time?" [...] "I wonder what's between them." [...] "I can tell you. [...] Silas is what he is--we wouldn't mind him-- [...] But just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide. [...] He never did a thing so very bad. [...] He don't know why he isn't quite as good [...] As anyone. He won't be made ashamed [...] To please his brother, worthless though he is." [...] "I can't think Si ever hurt anyone." [...] "No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay [...] And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back. [...] He wouldn't let me put him on the lounge. [...] You must go in and see what you can do. [...] I made the bed up for him there to-night. [...] You'll be surprised at him--how much he's broken. [...] His working days are done; I'm sure of it." [...] "I'd not be in a hurry to say that." [...] "I haven't been. Go, look, see for yourself. [...] But, Warren, please remember how it is: [...] He's come to help you ditch the meadow.

[...] It hit the moon. [...] Then there were three there, making a dim row, [...] The moon, the little silver cloud, and she.
