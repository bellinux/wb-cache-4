2500|$|On 28 June 1943, {{the first}} Tempest Mk.II, LA602, flew {{powered by a}} Centaurus IV (2,520hp/1,879kW) driving a four-blade propeller. LA602 {{initially}} flew with a Typhoon-type fin and rudder unit. This {{was followed by the}} second, LA607, which was completed with the enlarged dorsal fin and first flew on 18 September 1943: LA607 was assigned to engine development. The first major problem experienced during the first few flights was serious engine vibrations, which were cured by replacing the rigid, eight-point engine mountings with six-point rubber-packed <b>shock</b> <b>mounts.</b> In a further attempt to alleviate engine vibration, the four blade propeller was replaced with a five blade unit; eventually, a finely balanced four bladed unit was settled on. Problems were also experienced with engine overheating, poor crankshaft lubrication, exhaust malfunctions and reduction-gear seizures. Because of these problems, and because of the decision to [...] "tropicalise" [...] all Tempest IIs for service in the South-East Asian theatre, production was delayed.|$|E

50|$|Røde {{announced}} a strategic alliance in early 2013 with UK microphone accessory manufacturer Rycote, {{that would allow}} Røde to utilise Rycote’s patented Lyre <b>shock</b> <b>mounting</b> system in future microphone and accessory products.

50|$|<b>Shock</b> <b>mounts</b> {{are found}} in some disc drives and compact disc players, in which soft {{bushings}} are all that mechanically hold the disk and reading assembly, thereby isolating it from outside vibrations and from other outside loads such as torsion.|$|E
50|$|In {{a variety}} of applications, a <b>shock</b> <b>mount</b> is a {{mechanical}} fastener that connects two parts elastically. They are used for shock and vibration isolation.|$|R
5000|$|Production {{was moved}} to Sportech. With this move came several {{improvements}} {{to the design of}} the Burner, including a single machined block to support the bottom bracket, rear <b>shock</b> <b>mount</b> and chainstay swing-arm pivot.|$|R
50|$|A similar idea, {{also known}} as a <b>shock</b> <b>mount,</b> is found in {{furniture}} design, introduced by Charles and Ray Eames. This provides some shock absorption and serves as a living hinge, allowing the seat back to pivot.|$|R
5000|$|... "Shock mount" [...] racks are {{designed}} for musicians who frequently move gear between venues. <b>Shock</b> <b>mounts</b> help to protect electronic devices from bumps during transportation. Devices that are less than 19 inches wide may use special [...] "ear" [...] adapters to mount on a rack.|$|E
50|$|Through {{extensive}} {{trial and}} error, Charles and Ray arrived at an alternate solution: create two separate pieces {{for the seat}} and backrest, joined by a plywood spine and supported by plywood legs. The result was a chair with a sleek and honest appearance. All of the connections were visible and the material was not hidden beneath upholstery. The seat was joined to the spine and legs {{with a series of}} four heavy rubber washers with nuts embedded in them (later these came to be called 'shock mounts'). The <b>shock</b> <b>mounts</b> were glued to the underside of the seat, and screwed in through the bottom of the chair. The backrest was also attached using <b>shock</b> <b>mounts.</b> From the front and top the seat and back are uninterrupted by fasteners. The rubber mounts were pliable, allowing the backrest to flex and move with the sitter. This unique technology {{is also one of the}} chair's greatest flaws. The <b>shock</b> <b>mounts</b> are glued to the wooden backrest, but may tear free for various reasons. A common response to this problem was to drill directly through the backrest and insert fasteners between the backrest and the lumbar support. This greatly devalues the chair, since it changes the original aesthetic of smooth, uninterrupted wooden forms.|$|E
50|$|The radios {{contained}} 100 transistors and 8 {{vacuum tubes}} and were modular in design, allowing most servicing {{to be done}} with only a screw driver. Later upgrades replaced the vacuum tubes with transistors. A variety of accessories were available, including antennas, control heads, encryptors, head sets, <b>shock</b> <b>mounts,</b> speakers and interconnecting cables.|$|E
50|$|Mobile radios {{installed}} on motorcycles {{are subject to}} extreme vibration and weather. Professional equipment designed for use on motorcycles is weather and vibration resistant. <b>Shock</b> <b>mounting</b> systems are used to reduce the radio's exposure to vibration imparted by the motorcycle's modal, or resonant, shaking.|$|R
50|$|A passive {{isolation}} system, {{such as a}} <b>shock</b> <b>mount,</b> {{in general}} contains mass, spring, and damping elements and moves as a harmonic oscillator. The mass and spring stiffness dictate a natural frequency of the system. Damping causes energy dissipation and has a secondary effect on natural frequency.|$|R
50|$|The gray metal chassis is {{shock-mounted}} at {{its four}} corners to reduce sensitivity to external shocks, {{and to reduce}} drive noise from residual imbalance when running fast. The soft <b>shock</b> <b>mount</b> grommets are just below the brass-colored screws at the four corners (the left one is obscured).|$|R
5000|$|Relative {{costs of}} {{different}} isolation systems: Inexpensive <b>shock</b> <b>mounts</b> {{may need to}} be replaced due to dynamic loading cycles. A higher level of isolation which is effective at lower vibration frequencies and magnitudes generally costs more. Prices can range from a few dollars for bungee cords to millions of dollars for some space applications.|$|E
50|$|The Eameses {{constantly}} {{made use}} of new materials. The pair's first plywood chair—the Eames Lounge Chair Wood (LCW)—{{made use of}} a heavy rubber washer glued to the backrest {{of the chair and}} screwed to the lumbar support. These washers, which have come to be called 'shock mounts', allow the backrest to flex slightly. This technology was brought back in the 670 Lounge chair. The backrest and headrest are screwed together by a pair of aluminum supports. This unit is suspended on the seat via two connection points in the armrests. The armrests are screwed to <b>shock</b> <b>mounts</b> which are connected only via glue to the interior of the backrest shell, allowing the backrest and headrest to flex when the chair is in use. This is part of the chair's unusual design, as well as its weakest link. The <b>shock</b> <b>mounts</b> have been known to tear free causing catastrophic collapse and damage.|$|E
50|$|Rubber {{bushings}} compress {{synthetic rubber}} rings on bolts {{to provide some}} isolation. Other <b>shock</b> <b>mounts</b> have mechanical springs or an elastomer (in tension or compression) engineered to isolate an item from specified mechanical shock and vibration. Some form of dashpot is usually used with a spring to provide viscous damping. Viscoelastic materials are common. Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt models of viscoelasticity use springs and dashpots in series and parallel circuits respectively. Hydraulic and pneumatic components can be included, depending on the use.|$|E
40|$|A <b>shock</b> <b>mount</b> for {{installing}} {{electrical components}} on circuit boards is described.

5000|$|<b>Shock</b> <b>mounts</b> for {{microphones}} {{can provide}} basic protection from damage, but their prime use is to isolate microphones from mechanically transmitted noise. This can originate as floor vibrations transmitted through a floor stand, or as [...] "finger" [...] and other handling noise on boom poles. All microphones behave {{to some extent}} as accelerometers, with the most sensitive axis being perpendicular to the diaphragm. Additionally, some microphones contain internal elements such as vacuum tubes and transformers which can be inherently microphonic. These are often cushioned by resilient internal methods, {{in addition to the}} employment of external isolation mounts.|$|E
50|$|Natural rubber {{was first}} used as {{material}} for adhesives starting in 1830. In 1839, Charles Goodyear discovered that a rubber and sulfur mixture, when heated, becomes elastic. In 1843, Thomas Hancock named this process vulcanization. In 1862, a British patent (number 3288) was issued for the plating of metal with brass by electrodeposition to obtain a stronger bond to rubber. The development of the automobile {{and the need for}} rubber <b>shock</b> <b>mounts</b> required stronger and more durable bonds of rubber and metal. This spurred the development of cyclized rubber treated in strong acids. By 1927, this process was used to produce solvent-based thermoplastic rubber cements for metal to rubber bonding.|$|E
40|$|In this note, the {{application}} of dual-phase damping to a simple <b>shock</b> <b>mount</b> experiencing a harmonic input is described.
