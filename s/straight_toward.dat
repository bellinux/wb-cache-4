5|$|The {{volume of}} space within which an object {{can be said}} to orbit Jupiter is defined by Jupiter's Hill sphere (also called the Roche sphere). When the comet passed Jupiter in the late 1960s or early 1970s, it {{happened}} to be near its aphelion, and found itself slightly within Jupiter's Hill sphere. Jupiter's gravity nudged the comet towards it. Because the comet's motion with respect to Jupiter was very small, it fell almost <b>straight</b> <b>toward</b> Jupiter, which is why it ended up on a Jupiter-centric orbit of very high eccentricitythat is to say, the ellipse was nearly flattened out.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, the two {{armies of}} unequal {{strength}} {{faced each other}} across frozen fields fissured by ice-covered streams and ponds, which were in turn covered by snow and drifts. The snow and gloom meant that neither side {{was aware of the}} inequalities of men and artillery. Napoleon opened the engagement by sending Soult's's corps, which successfully pushed the Russian right flank back, nearly turning the Russian force. To follow up on this success, he ordered Pierre Augereau's force to attack the left center. No sooner had Augereau and VII Corps, plus St. Hilaire's division, sallied out when a sudden snow storm engulfed the battle field. In white-out conditions, Augereau's entire corps disappeared in a flurry of whirling snow. When the snow cleared, friend and foe alike discovered that the first units onto the field had wandered off course. The line of march should have taken them directly to the Russian flank; have no point of reference, they had instead followed the terrain and led the entire corps parallel to the Russian line, along a V-shaped formation in which the left and center merged, and directly into the face of the Russian 70–gun batteries. The artillery, although shocked to find a French Corps advancing <b>straight</b> <b>toward</b> them, immediately opened fire, as did the Russian infantry on both sides of Augereau's corps.|$|E
25|$|Maury {{had been}} engaged {{sometime}} before this. As {{soon as he}} heard the firing on his left, he knew that Davies and Hamilton would be kept too busy to interfere with his movements, and gave the order for his division to move <b>straight</b> <b>toward</b> the town. His right encountered a stubborn resistance at about 11 a.m. from Battery Robinett, a redan protected by a five-foot ditch, sporting three 20-pounder Parrott rifles commanded by Lt. Henry Robinett. Fierce hand-to-hand combat ensued, and Maury was forced to retire with heavy losses from arguably the hottest action of the two-day battle. Col. William P. Rogers of the 2nd Texas, a Mexican–American War comrade of President Jefferson Davis, was among those killed in the charge. Col. Lawrence Sullivan Ross of the 6th Texas was thrown from his horse and mistakenly reported killed with Rogers.|$|E

25|$|The attack {{began at}} around 10:30A.M. when six gunmen, wearing {{explosive}} belts entered the school {{from the back}} through a cemetery adjacent to the school after having scaled the walls. Army Public School is located at Warsak Road near the Peshawar Cantt, and is part of Army Public Schools and College Systems that runs 146 schools in Pakistan. Before entering the school, the gunmen {{set fire to the}} Suzuki Bolan ST41 van in which they had arrived. The terrorists, bearing automatic weapons,and grenades, moved <b>straight</b> <b>toward</b> the auditorium located at the centre of the complex and opened fire indiscriminately on the children who were gathered there for First aid training. According to the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the public relations department of the Pakistani military, Major-General Asim Bajwa, the terrorists did not intend to take any hostages but instead wanted to kill as many pupils as they could. As the terrorists opened fire, many of the pupils ran toward the two exits {{on the other side of}} the auditorium, but many of them were gunned down in the garden.|$|E
25|$|Lagrange's {{division}} {{angled to}} the left toward Bannay, led by the 2nd Light Infantry Regiment and a marine battalion, while Ricard's division marched <b>straight</b> <b>toward</b> Baye. Olsufiev sent Evstafi Evstafievich Udom with two jäger infantry battalions to clear the French skirmishers out of Baye. As the French pressure increased, Udom was reinforced so {{that he had the}} 10th, 12th, 22nd and 38th Jäger Regiments and six guns. Around 11:00 am Ricard pressed Udom's troops back into Baye and the nearby woods. Olsufiev sent a brigade and six guns to hold the right flank while the bulk of his corps deployed between Baye and Bannay. The French brought 12 guns into action as more and more of their soldiers passed the bridge and arrived on the field. Pierre Pelleport's brigade led Lagrange's division as it assaulted Bannay. At 1:00 pm Olsufiev was still holding out on his forward position. At that hour, the Russian commander held a council of war in which his generals voted for a retreat to Étoges. Olsufiev refused, saying that he had specific orders to hold Champaubert.|$|E
25|$|In the MVC final, the Cougars were {{pitted against}} the 3rd seeded Drake Bulldogs, {{who had already}} won two tournament games. SIUE came out hard, {{dominating}} possession {{during the first half}} and outshooting DU 9 to 1, but the Bulldogs' defense held firm for a 0–0 halftime score. The second half was more evenly played, but Drake was a bit more effective. When the Cougars failed to clear a ball in the 77th minute, Dal Santo made a last instant save that set up a Drake corner kick; the kick bounced around in the six yard box before SIUE finally seemed to clear it, but it went <b>straight</b> <b>toward</b> Drake freshman reserve Ciszweski, who blasted a return shot through the crowd in front of the net that Dal Santo barely saw and had no chance of stopping. The Cougars then intensified their effort after falling behind, but as in the semis, seemed unable to put together an effective attack. In the end, Drake earned its first MVC Tournament title since 2009, and SIUE would have to wait to find out if their record was good enough to get an at-large bid to return to the NCAA Tournament.|$|E

2500|$|Whether {{or not it}} is all-encompassing in so doing, Newtonian {{mechanics}} deals {{only with}} caused events, e.g.: If an object begins in a known position and is hit dead on by an object with some known velocity, then it will be pushed <b>straight</b> <b>toward</b> another predictable point. If it goes somewhere else, the Newtonians argue, one must question one's measurements of the original position of the object, the exact direction of the striking object, gravitational or other fields that were inadvertently ignored, etc. Then, they maintain, repeated experiments and improvements in accuracy will always bring one's observations closer to the theoretically predicted results. When dealing with situations on an ordinary human scale, Newtonian physics has been so enormously successful that it has no competition. But it fails spectacularly as velocities become some substantial fraction of the speed of light and when interactions at the atomic scale are studied. Before the discovery of quantum effects and other challenges to Newtonian physics, [...] "uncertainty" [...] was always a term that applied to the accuracy of human knowledge about causes and effects, and not to the causes and effects themselves.|$|E
