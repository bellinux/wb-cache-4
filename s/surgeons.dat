5|$|With {{the spread}} of {{cardiovascular}} surgery in India, the annual scientific meeting of the thoracic and cardiovascular <b>surgeons</b> was held independently in 1985 under the new title Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular <b>Surgeons</b> of India. In 1990 the Indian Association of Cardiovascular-thoracic <b>Surgeons</b> was registered at Bombay. On 15 June 1991, the Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular <b>Surgeons</b> of India was dissolved through a unanimous resolution passed by its general body during its annual meeting in Bombay, and its entire membership, funds, and assets were transferred to the new Association of Cardiovascular-thoracic <b>Surgeons.</b> Panday was elected as {{the first president of}} the latter society on 15 June 1991. The following year, the Fellowship of the Association (F.I.A.C.S) was instituted and regular biannual publication of the Journal of the Indian Association of Cardiovascular-thoracic <b>Surgeons</b> commenced.|$|E

5|$|On {{one side}} of the road is a barber surgeon whose sign advertises Shaving, bleeding, and teeth drawn with a touch. Ecce signum! Inside the shop, the barber, who may be drunk, haphazardly shaves a customer, holding his nose like that of a pig, while spots of blood darken the cloth under his chin. The <b>surgeons</b> and barbers had been a single {{profession}} since 1540 and would not finally separate until 1745, when the <b>surgeons</b> broke away to form the Company of <b>Surgeons.</b> Bowls on the windowsill contain blood from the day's patients.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>surgeons</b> {{working on}} the body are {{observed}} by the mortar-boarded academics in the front row, the physicians, who can be identified by their wigs and canes, largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves.

Freke had been involved in the high-profile attempt to secure the body of condemned rioter Bosavern Penlez for dissection in 1749.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{decided to}} have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the {{financial}} depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland {{time to make a}} full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The <b>surgeons</b> operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating <b>surgeons</b> discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the <b>surgeons</b> present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.|$|E
