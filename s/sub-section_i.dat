The lateral mixing coefficient is a crucial parameter for reproducing the transverse mixing either by numerical simulation or by analytical prediction. Since the solute mixing can be greatly affected by the lateral variations in water depth. mixing coefficient should be determined in each <b>sub-section</b> (<b>i.</b> e., the main channel, side slope and flood plain) separately. In this article. the transverse mixing in a symmetric trapezoidal compound channel was studied based on laboratory measurement of longitudinal and transverse velocity components and lateral distribution of solute concentration. The lateral mixing coefficient was estimated by adopting different Schmidt numbers in different sub-sections divided according to the developing trend of the eddy viscosity, and finally a piecewise linear profile of mixing coefficient was adopted to analytically predict the transverse solute concentration. The comparison between the analytically predicted data and the measuring solute concentration proved {{that this is an}} effective way to estimate the lateral mixing in the open channel flow with lateral variations in water depth. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{involves}} the submission of published academic {{work with a}} critical commentary, {{in accordance with the}} regulations of the University of the West of England on Supervised DPhil degrees. Nine papers are submitted, published from 1998 to 2013. Although their subject matter is diverse, I argue in the critical commentary that the work is concerned with critical organizational history and historiography, counterfactuals and modality, and connections, boundaries and identity. The works submitted are theoretical rather than empirical in nature (hence 'theory' in the thesis title) and are thematically connected either by a focus on practice (academic practice, or in and around organizations more generally; hence 'practice'), or by a concern with connecting separate bodies of theory or disciplinary areas (hence 'boundary work'), or both. There are also common themes connecting the papers, in as much as organizational history - broadly conceived as the connection between the organizational past and present, and its interpretation, representation, and so on - and strategy (traditionally and historically concerned with organizational action which connects the present to the future) remain a major focus. The second clause of the thesis title is intended to reflect these concerns. In the introduction to the commentary I briefly comment on the title of the thesis and its relation to the selected papers, list the papers selected for the thesis, and outline the structure of the commentary.

40|$|Terahertz {{research}} has came {{a long way}} since its inception in the mid 1980 s when the first pulsed THz emission was reported using electro-optic sampling. With rapid advent in THz generation and detection techniques, research in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has progressed to such a great extent that terahertz is finding potential use in real world applications such as biomedical sensing, security screening and defence related applications. While many researchers and commercial organizations have successfully demonstrated efficacy of terahertz, various challenges still exist before THz technology transitions from the realm of research into everyday life. This thesis focuses on the topical area of characterization and mitigation of scattering in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy measurements. Motivated by the lack of theoretical models and signal processing techniques, this thesis, presents several pieces of novel work that include theoretical models, numerical methods, signal processing techniques and experimental procedures to estimate and mitigate the scattering contribution in THz-TDS measurements of dielectric materials. The thesis is divided in to three main sections: Section I describes the various theoretical models developed for estimating and approximating the scattering cross-section, when an electromagnetic wave interacts with a random medium with characteristic particle dimensions comparable to the wavelength of the incident radiation. The section is divided in two main <b>sub-sections,</b> (<b>i)</b> scattering through a sparse distribution of particles, and (ii) scattering from dense media. Section II presents several signal processing based approaches for estimating and mitigating scattering effects in THz-TDS measurements for samples that exhibit sharp and sparse absorption features, without requiring a priori information such as its granularity, refractive index, and density. Section III discusses some common experimental techniques such as milling the material of interest into fine powder and time domain averaging spatially disjoint or multiple sample measurements, {{in order to reduce the}} presence of scattering features and effects in the THz-TDSmeasurements. Recognizing the invasive access and/or specializedmeasurement apparatus requirement for these techniques, we present our preliminary investigation in analysing multiple Fresnel echoes for estimating and mitigating scattering contribution in THz-TDS measurements. In addition to this, the thesis offers an introductory background to THz-TDS, in areas of hardware, applications, signal processing, and terahertz interaction with matter. Thesis (Ph. D.)

30|$|This {{section is}} devoted to the {{influence}} of African slavery outside of Africa, with a focus on the trans-Atlantic experience and thus on New World economies. The impact of the influx of slaves from Africa on the countries in the Americas has been emphasized in seminal work by Engerman and Sokoloff (1997), who argue that differences in factor endowments implied differences in the reliance on slave labor, with dramatic consequences for the degree of inequality. Extreme historical inequalities—in wealth, human capital, and political power—then exerted a permanent influence on economic development, since they favored the endogenous formation of institutional structures that, rather than promoting growth, maintained the privileges of the elites against the interests of the masses. Nunn (2008 b) tests the Engerman-Sokoloff hypothesis in two settings: across 29 former New World countries and across US counties and states. In both settings, he finds a negative impact of past slavery on current development (even though this impact is not driven by plantation slavery). He also investigates whether inequality is the channel through which slavery adversely affects current performances, but he finds no support for this mechanism. Over a world-wide sample of 46 countries including also North-African and Southern-European recipients of African slaves, Soares et al. (2012) find a significant correlation between past slavery and current levels of inequality. The economics of labor coercion from the perspective of productive efficiency is modeled by Lagerlöf (2009) and Acemoglu and Wolitzky (2011). Apart from the exceptions just mentioned, most of the research on the long-term effects of African slavery has focused on individual countries.

40|$|The {{function}} of lectures {{is to provide}} a basic framework for a module and a springboard for further investigation through reading, discussion and essay writing. No module can be adequately studied solely by attending lectures, but important areas of courses will not be properly grasped if a series of lectures is missed. All lectures, seminars and screenings on AM modules are compulsory. You will approach lectures with varying levels of background knowledge, so some subjects will be familiar to you and others not. It is not necessarily true that the more notes you take, the more profitable the hour has been. You might leave the lecture without a single line, but with a fresh understanding of vital issues that will remain embedded in your mind. It is good practice to compile a file of lecture notes to which you can refer when writing essays and revising for exams. It is essential that notes are clear and well organised, so that they will make sense months after the lecture. This means: 1. Paying attention to the structure of the lecture. Since this is often outlined at the start, late arrival has its penalty. 2. Using the same structure for your notes, generally by numbering sections and points (one scheme is 1, 2, 3, with a, b, c for <b>sub-sections</b> and <b>i,</b> ii, iii for further sub-divisions). 3. Highlighting the lecture’s key points by underlining or starring significant information. 4. Avoiding the danger of trying to write down too much detail, which often leads to missing important parts of the lecture. One error is to write down examples given by the lecturer, because they are solid facts, rather than the presentation of key arguments or interpretations. Remember to concentrate on points of analysis as the core of your lecture notes, rather than on a narrative of events. 5. Reading through notes after the lecture, ensuring structure and highlights are clear and that points follow on from one another. Check names or dates of which you are uncertain.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to examine risk and {{governance}} disclosure practices in UK higher education institutions (HEIs) {{in a period of}} increased austerity and reform. Specifically, the project sought to investigate the extent to which UK HEIs voluntarily disclose information relating to their internal governance mechanisms and risk management in their annual/audit committee reports with the objective of identifying, developing and disseminating ‘best practice’ within the sector. Content analysis method was employed in collecting and analysing three main types of data from HEIs' annual/audit committee reports. First, a comprehensive weighted (i. e., scored from 0 to 6) best practice risk disclosure index, containing 127 risk items with three main <b>sub-sections,</b> consisting of: (<b>i)</b> financial; (ii) operational; and (iii) strategic risks, was developed based mainly on the HEFCE (2001 a, b, 2005) good practice guides for risk management in HEIs. Second, a comprehensive unweighted (i. e., scored from 0 to 1) good governance disclosure index containing 100 governance items with five <b>sub-sections,</b> consisting of: (<b>i)</b> governors and governing boards; (ii) processes and structures; (iii) performance evaluation, remuneration and rewards; (iv) auditing, accounting and accountability; and (v) dialogue with stakeholders and social responsibility, was developed based on the 2009 and 2014 CUC, 2008 CUC audit handbook, and 2013 CSC Scottish good governance codes. Third, a wide range of governance data relating to governing boards, governing board committees, senior management teams and financial data relating to UK HEIs were collected. The entire population of 164 UK publicly funded HEIs were longitudinally sampled from 2009 to 2014. The full data required was obtained for 117 (71 %) HEIs and therefore, were included in the final sample. The main findings are as follows: Overall, the level of transparency and disclosures relating to risk management practices by UK HEIs are relatively low (e. g., compared with similar sized for profit organisations), but the distribution varies widely, ranging from a minimum of 6. 96 % to a maximum of 31. 76 % with an average of 17. 31 %. •Of the three main types of risk items examined, disclosures relating to financial risk were highest, compared with operational and strategic risk disclosures. Specifically, the average UK HEI disclosed 30. 83 % of the financial risk items compared with 12. 66 % operational risk items and 16. 91 % strategic risk items. •Overall, and similar to the risk disclosures, the level of transparency and disclosures relating to governance practices by UK HEIs were relatively low (e. g., compared with similar sized for profit organisations), with the distribution equally varying widely, ranging from a minimum of 8. 00 % to a maximum of 75. 00 % with an average of 40. 02 %. •Of the five main types of governance mechanisms investigated, disclosures relating to the governors and governing boards were the highest, whilst those relating to performance evaluation, remuneration and rewards were the lowest. Specifically, the average UK HEI disclosed 52. 65 %, 49. 67 %, 40. 07 %, 31. 52 %, and 24. 98 % of the governance structures examined relating to governors and governing boards, auditing, accounting and accountability, dialogue with stakeholders and social responsibility, processes and structures, and performance evaluation, remuneration and rewards, respectively. •A positive finding is that a steady increasing pattern can be observed with respect to both disclosures relating to the risk items, and governance structures that were examined over time. For example, the average UK HEI’s level of good risk (governance) disclosures were 16. 31 % (37. 37 %), 16. 63 % (38. 96 %), 17. 07 % (39. 66 %), 17. 47 % (40. 46 %), 17. 97 % (41. 14 %) and 18. 41 % (42. 51 %), respectively, in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, accounting for about 13 (14) percentage points increase over the six years investigated. These increasing patterns are also observable in the sub-indices. However, and on average, disclosures relating to governance mechanisms were higher than those relating to risk management practices. <br/...|$|R

Chapters 2 to 7 provide what is essentially background or supporting information for the key comparisons that I make in Chapters 8 to 12 (Note: Chapter 5 provides the key ideas that were encompassed in my original proposal together with supporting addenda). The later chapters each contain <b>sub-sections</b> in which <b>I</b> compare the two technologies with respect to the specific findings that I relate in those chapters. The overall conclusions which bring these all together are detailed in Chapter 13, with a critical evaluation of my work appearing in Chapter 14. Underpinning the investigation are two applications which I have developed in order to both assist my investigations and to use where necessary to demonstrate my conclusions and assertions. Whilst not being able to address all of the aspects of the project that I had originally wished to, let alone all the facilities that the two technologies support, I believe that this project shows that there are enough differences between them such that for those parties who have yet to make any financial, intellectual or needs-driven commitment to either, careful consideration of their relative capabilities should be taken. Within this, I also contend that there is a philosophical difference between the two technologies, i. e. that Microsoft is aiming its Silverlight offering towards web designers, and Adobe?s target for Flex is the application developer, and that this drive by both companies to poach a share of the market traditionally seen as the province of the other has resulted in some interesting differences between the implementations of their respective product platforms. Through a demonstration of the results of my investigations I conclude that, all other external factors being equal, the Adobe Flex / Flex Builder 3 approach is overall more comprehensive, efficient and therefore I believe productive. However, with the exception of two very key issues (i. e. The lack of formal support by Adobe for an implementation of multi-scale image technology and problems with running Silverlight applications on Linux / Unix-based systems), I also conclude that the differences I have identified and have declared as important from my perspective could well be outweighed by other issues that are specifically pertinent to another individual, organisation or academic institution. I also conclude that whilst I believe my arguments are sound in respect of the factors and criteria investigated, I also acknowledge that further work may identify other differences that may be influential. In addition, both Microsoft and Adobe announced beta release developments of their respective products {{during the course of this}} project and although I took the, what I believe was justifiable, decision not to include them in my investigations (primarily for technical reasons), I must also acknowledge that it is possible that some of these developments may highlight a divergence (or desirable convergence) between the two technologies in one or more important measures...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years {{research}} on medieval sermons has entered a new phase, and the thesis needs to be placed in the context of recent work in Prance, Germany, and Italy; a few years ago there would have been little point in attempting to write on the subject I have chosen. The work of a German scholar has provided us with systematic guides to the authors, incipits, and manuscripts of medieval sermons, so that it is now possible to make efficient use of the manuscript sources; monographs on vernacular preaching have cleared the way for a study of the Latin 'popular' sermons and their international circulation; moreover work {{of a small group of}} scholars, based in different parts of Europe, has reached a stage at which an attempt to write a synthesis is desirable A general survey of the subject would be premature: instead I have tried to outline an interpretation of the main turning point in the history of high medieval preaching. The decisive change was the revival of preaching to the laity, which had ceased to play a major part in religious life between the fall of the Roman empire and the rise of the medieval towns. In the first two sub sections of the thesis (pp. 1 - 22) I give a brief selective narrative of the external history of this transformation of preaching, but the greater part of the thesis is devoted to the less obvious changes which lay behind the revival. The remaining <b>sub-sections</b> of part <b>I</b> deal with the pocket books of sermons which itinerant preachers used (p. 22 seqq.), the diffusion of stereotyped material - 'preaching aids' - to help the busy or inexperienced (p. 36 seqq.), the emergence of an educated lay 'sermon hearing public' (p. 58 seqq.), and the training of preachers, especially the friars (p. 73 seqq.). Parts II and III are on the form and content of sermons respectively The theme of part II (p. 92 seqq.) is the new sermon form which came to maturity in the thirteenth century, and its relation to the revival of popular preaching. Here I state and attempt to explain the paradox that a form which was closely associated with academic milieux was alco used with success in the vast majority of sermons to the laity. Part III (p. 134 seqq.) reaches a somewhat similar conclusion by a different route. I try to show how far the content of preaching was adapted to the new urban public, and here I discuss in detail a genre of preaching aid designed to provide ready made sermons specially adapted to different sorts and conditions of men. However, I go on to argue that, apart from this genre, the content of sermons was less affected by the auditory than might have been expected: popular sermons do not differ greatly from academic sermons. I conclude by trying to show why the' same sort of sermon could have been effective with both university and lay congregations. The fourth part of the thesis (p. 212 seqq.) is a case study of a sermon collection, variously called Legifer and the 'Collectiones fratrum', whose history seems to be an exceptionally clear illustration of a theme which deserves special emphasis. For although I try to give an idea of the variety of different aspects of the preaching revival, I also argue a thesis in the older sense of the term. It seems to me that the close relation between the academic world and popular preaching is a theme which deserves special attention, and that the University of Paris contributed to the revival of preaching in two distinct ways. Firstly, Paris was a centre for the diffusion of model sermon collections. Popular preachers all over Europe preached from ready made model sermons written and/or copied at Paris. Secondly, Paris provided a training for the preachers themselves. Biblical lectures imparted preachable doctrine but in addition to this the system of university sermons ensured that theology students had a training of a more practice! kind. Bachelors and auditores could be called upon to preach before the University, and thir ordeal must have been a major hurdle - demanding careful preparation - for the more junior students. The evidence suggests that students would normally be asked to give a sermon after mid-day - a collatio - rather than a morning sermon. They were normally held in the houses of the Franciscans or Dominicans. The student friars, most of whom were destined to become 'professional' preachers, must have found the training especially valuable. It is the more significant in that it was the only direct and practical preparation for preaching that a friar was given. This argument presupposes the general similarity between academic and popular preaching which is discussed in Parts II and III. The Legifer collection has been singled out for special attention because it seema almost an 'ideal-type' of the link between the two types of preaching. It is a handbook of model sermons for popular preachers which appears to have been based on collations given at the houses of the friars, probably at Paris. Since it was diffused by the pecia system of the university stationers it also represents the other contribution of Paris to popular preaching. After outlining the evidence for Legifer 's unusual history (p. 212 seqq.) I make it the basis for a brief analysis of the theological culture which a section of the laity was beginning to share with educated clerics (p. 225 seqq.). The thesis concludes with a selection of illustrative texts and an appendix. The documents are transcriptions, not editions, and thoir purpose is to illustrate points made in the main body of the thesis. The first two texts are examples of the old and the new sermon forms respectively. The third text is included to illustrate the use of the new 'scholastic' form in a sermon to a lay congregation. It is also an example of a sermon in which the content is specifically orientated to one kind of lay audience. The fourth, fifth, and sixth sermons show the other side of the coin. Text IV is a 'popular' sermon which could easily be mistaken for an academic one; texts V and VI are a university sermon and a model sermon for popular preachers respectively: they have the same theme, and when they are read together the general similarity of form and content is more striking than the differences. The last text is followed by an appendix, on franciscan preachers' pocket hooks, which gives some of the evidence too detailed to be included in the section (Part I, 3, p. 22 seqq.) on 'Preachers' books'. </p...|$|R
