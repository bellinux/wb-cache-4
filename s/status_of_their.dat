5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} {{the differences between}} men and women as much as she emphasizes the importance of virtue in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines virtue in such a way that it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> gender.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, {{there was a}} growing number of intellectuals (Samir Kassir, Ziad Majed, Elias Khoury) and a network of {{independent}} student groups ("Independent Leftist Groups") who advocated democracy, individual liberties, secularism and center-left economic policies in Lebanon. On the other hand, a growing number Lebanese Communist Party (LCP) members were dissatisfied with the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> party: the rise of Islamic Fundamentalism, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the failure of the LCP to assume a more democratic socialist platform ushered in an era of political decline for the party. This, coupled with perceived Syrian domination of its leadership, led to increasing frustration among rank-and-file communists against the upper echelons of the party.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hospital}} {{was founded in}} the town by Bishop Fray Pedro de Silva in 1485. Those affected by the plague epidemic were treated here in 1506. During the 16th century the city experienced a cultural renaissance thanks to personalities such as the painter Luis de Morales, the composer Juan Vázquez, the humanist Rodrigo Dosma, the poet Joaquin Romero de Cepeda, the playwright Diego Sánchez de Badajoz, the Dominican mystic Fray Luis de Granada and architect Gaspar Méndez. In 1524, a board meeting between representatives of Spain and Portugal {{took place in the}} Old Town Hall in the city to clarify the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> territorial arrangements, attended by Hernando Colón, Juan Vespucio, Sebastián Caboto, Juan Sebastián Elcano, Diego Ribeiro and Esteban Gómez. With reason to assert their rights to the Portuguese Crown, Philip II of Spain briefly moved his court to Badajoz in August 1580. Queen Anne of Austria died in the city two months later, and on 5 December 1580, Philip moved out of the city. From 1580 until 1640, {{as a result of the}} absence of war, the city flourished once again. According to the historian Vicente Navarro del Castillo, some 428 residents of Badajoz contributed to the Spanish conquest of the Americas, including Pedro de Alvarado, Luis de Moscoso, Sebastián Garcilaso de la Vega y Vargas (father of Inca Garcilaso) and Hernán Sánchez de Badajoz. In 1640 the city was attacked during the Portuguese Restoration War.|$|E

25|$|The {{most basic}} {{definition}} of linguistic rights {{is the right}} of individuals to use their language {{with other members of}} their linguistic group, regardless of the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> language.

25|$|On November 18, 1918, the Republic of Latvia was proclaimed as an {{independent}} democratic state.

25|$|The {{participants}} were not only selected for their mountaineering abilities; the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> families and any military experience or university degrees were also factors in the selection procedures. Military experience was of the highest importance in the public image and communication to the newspapers. Quaker-educated Richard B.

Those that are in deficit have the option of borrowing the required funds from the central bank, where they may be charged a lending rate (sometimes known as a discount rate) on the amount they borrow. On the other hand, the banks that have excess reserves can simply leave them with the central bank and earn a support rate from the central bank. Some countries, such as Japan, have a support rate of zero.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, as both young states built their {{institutions}} this often reduced <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> minorities. In Latvia, children of mixed marriages were registered as Latvians while in Estonia they took nationality of fathers, who increasingly were Estonians, this quickly reduced number of German children. German place names were eliminated from public use. German congregations lost their churches. Tallinn Cathedral {{was given to}} Estonian congregation in 1927.

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that these territories did not belong to the Commonwealth any longer, and were under foreign rule, their {{administration}} existed for further 100 years, until the Partitions of Poland, with a complex hierarchy of all kinds of regional offices. The existence of fictional titles {{was the result of the}} special role of offices in the minds of the Polish–Lithuanian nobility: even though these offices were only honorary, without any material privileges and salaries, they determined social <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> bearers. Furthermore, having a title, albeit fictional, emphasized the position of an individual nobleman as a keen citizen and co-creator of the Commonwealth.|$|E
25|$|In {{this way}} the {{institution}} of slavery in Maryland was made self-perpetuating, as the slaves lived well enough to reproduce. The numbers of slaves in Maryland increased by continued imports up until 1808, and also by natural increase. By making slave status dependent on the mother, according {{to the principle of}} partus sequitur ventrem, Maryland, like Virginia, abandoned the common-law approach of England, in which the social status of children depended on their father. In the colonies, children would take the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mothers and thus be born into slavery if their mothers were enslaved, regardless if their fathers were white, English and Christian, as many were.|$|E
25|$|Disinterested benevolence was {{the basis}} for piety, {{according}} to the New Divinity. It originates at conversion when the Holy Spirit was believed to renew the heart so that the convert desires union with Christ through faith and embraces the way of the cross, which is self-sacrifice. In this, self-love is eliminated and the convert seeks happiness in God and his creation. For Edwards, a disinterest in one's self and a preoccupation with God's moral excellence was an indication that such a person had been regenerated. Such persons no longer worried over the <b>status</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own souls because their love for God and the contemplation of his glory made assurance of one's salvation virtually an afterthought.|$|E
