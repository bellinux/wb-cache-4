25|$|Xu Shu {{was from}} Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡), Yu Province, {{which is in}} present-day central Henan. His {{original}} family name was Shan (單) and his original given name was Fu (福). He was a swordsman in his early life and he once helped someone take revenge by killing another person. To avoid being recognised, he covered his face with white chalk and let his hair run wild. He was later arrested by an official, who asked him for his name, {{but he did not}} reply. The official tied him to a cart, paraded him through the streets, and asked for any person who could identify him. No one came forth. Xu Shu's fellows rescued him later. He was <b>so</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> be saved that he gave up his life as a swordsman and became a scholar.|$|E

500|$|Banks {{signed with}} the Chicago Cubs in late 1953, making his major league debut on September 17 at age 22 and playing in 10 games at Wrigley Field. He was the Cubs' first black player; {{he became one of}} several former Negro league players who joined MLB teams without playing in the minor leagues. Larry Moffi and Jonathan Kronstadt wrote that he [...] "just was not the crusading type. He was <b>so</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> be playing {{baseball}} for a living, he did not have time to change the world, and if that meant some people called him an Uncle Tom, well, so be it." ...|$|E
500|$|During college Rodman {{worked at}} a summer youth {{basketball}} camp, where he befriended camper Bryne Rich, who was shy and withdrawn due to a hunting accident in which he mistakenly shot and killed his best friend. The two became almost inseparable and formed a close bond. Rich invited Rodman to his rural Oklahoma home; at first, Rodman was not well-received by the Riches because he was black. But the Riches were <b>so</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> him for bringing their son out of his shell {{that they were able}} to set aside their prejudices. Although Rodman had severe family and personal issues himself, he [...] "adopted" [...] the Riches as his own in 1982 and went from the city life to [...] "driving a tractor and messing with cows". Though Rodman credited the Riches as his [...] "surrogate family" [...] that helped him through college, as of 2013 he had stopped communicating with the Rich family for reasons unknown to them.|$|E
500|$|... "This Is the Day" [...] {{was taken}} from Ivy's second studio album Apartment Life which was {{released}} on October 7, 1997 by Atlantic Records. It was prominently featured in the 1998 American comedy film There's Something About Mary and was also included on the film's official soundtrack. Reflecting on its usage in the film, Durand commented that it was unimaginable to see their songs in several scenes and that she [...] "fe <b>so</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> have something like that in a movie". The song was recorded in 1997 in New York City at three different recording studios. Despite Atlantic Records signing Ivy earlier in 1997, they were later dropped and picked up by 550 Music. Following its inclusion on the film, the aforementioned label distributed the song to radio stations across the United States on October 19, 1998, in addition to releasing it as a CD single in the United States; two formats were created, with the commercial release including bonus tracks [...] "Sleeping Late" [...] and [...] "Sweet Mary" [...] and the promotional featuring just the album version of the single.

500|$|Later in 2004, McAdams starred {{opposite}} fellow Canadian Ryan Gosling in {{the romantic}} drama The Notebook, based on Nicholas Sparks' {{novel of the}} same name. She played Allie Hamilton, a wealthy southern belle who has a forbidden love affair with Gosling's poor labourer, Noah Calhoun. McAdams spent time in Charleston, South Carolina prior to filming to familiarize herself with the southern accent, and took ballet and etiquette classes. Filming took place from late 2002 to early 2003. Although McAdams and Gosling became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on set. [...] "We inspired the worst in each other," [...] Gosling has said. [...] "It was a strange experience, making a love story and not getting along with your co-star in any way." [...] At one point, Gosling asked the film's director Nick Cassavetes to [...] "bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot" [...] because he felt McAdams was being uncooperative. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the [...] "spontaneous and combustible" [...] performances of the two leads while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times was won over by the [...] "beauty and clarity" [...] of McAdams's performance. Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune declared her [...] "a real discovery" [...] who [...] "infuses young Allie with that radiant, breathlessly winning ingénue grace and charm that breaks hearts". [...] The film grossed over $115million worldwide. McAdams won an MTV Movie Award and four Teen Choice Awards. Entertainment Weekly {{has said that the}} movie contains the All-Time Best Movie Kiss while the Los Angeles Times has included a scene from the film in a list of the 50 Classic Movie Kisses. The Notebook has appeared on many Most Romantic Movies lists. [...] "I'm <b>so</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> have a film that people respond to in that way", McAdams told Elle in 2011.

2500|$|In 1849, Carnegie {{became a}} {{telegraph}} messenger {{boy in the}} Pittsburgh Office of the Ohio Telegraph Company, at $2.50 per week (or $76 in 2017 dollars), following the recommendation of his uncle. He was a very hard worker and would memorize all of the locations of Pittsburgh's businesses and the faces of important men. He made many connections this way. He also paid close attention to his work, and quickly learned to distinguish the differing sounds the incoming telegraph signals produced. He developed the ability to translate signals by ear, without using the paper slip, and within a year was promoted to operator. Carnegie's education and passion for reading was given a great boost by Colonel James Anderson, who opened his personal library of 400 volumes to working boys each Saturday night. Carnegie was a consistent borrower and a [...] "self-made man" [...] in both his economic development and his intellectual and cultural development. He was <b>so</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> Colonel Anderson {{for the use of}} his library that he [...] "resolved, if ever wealth came to me, [...] that other poor boys might receive opportunities similar to those for which we were indebted to the noble man". His capacity, his willingness for hard work, his perseverance and his alertness soon brought forth opportunities.|$|E
2500|$|Following an {{application}} on 19 December 2012 by the Attorney General Dominic Grieve, the High Court quashed the verdicts {{in the original}} inquests and ordered fresh inquests to be held. Sir John Goldring was appointed as Assistant Coroner for South Yorkshire (East) and West Yorkshire (West) to conduct those inquests. The inquest hearings started on Monday 31 March 2014 at Warrington. Transcripts of the proceedings and evidence that was produced during the hearings were published at the Hillsborough Inquests official website. On 6 April 2016, the nine jurors were sent out to consider their verdicts. These were formally given to the inquest at 11:00 on 26 April 2016. The jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing in respect of all 96 victims (by majority verdict of 7–2). Upon receiving the April 2016 verdict, Hillsborough Family Support Group chair Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son James {{was killed in the}} disaster, said: [...] "Let's be honest about this – people were against us. We had the media against us, as well as the establishment. Everything was against us. The only people that weren't against us was our own city.

2500|$|A {{conservative}} {{contributor to}} Ain't it Cool News said the film featured [...] "ingenious comedy that we remember from Airplane!" [...] and was [...] "funny and inventive." [...] Kathleen Parker of Washington Post Writers Group described {{the film as}} [...] " [...] The Best Movie You Ever Saw, but it’s something. It’s radical in its assault on the left wing; it’s brave given the risk of peer ridicule {{and the potential for}} career suicide. And it’s funny — if you like that sort of thing. Generally, I don’t." [...] Michael Brendan Doherty of The American Conservative considered the movie to be funny [...] "in parts", but concluded that [...] "Far from lampooning the Left, “Carol” insults conservatives by presuming that they are so simple as to be won over by fat jokes and flatulence. But the audience, imagining itself to be persecuted by Hollywood, is <b>so</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> be flattered by Zucker and company that they chuckle obediently at every cheap laff." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the movie one star out of five, called it [...] "jaw-droppingly awful," [...] and [...] "about as not-funny as a comedy can get." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wrote, [...] "Even if it weren't three years too late to parody Moore (ineptly played by Kevin Farley), Moore's ridiculous tribute to Cuban health care in Sicko is far funnier than anything in this desperately laughless farce from David Zucker." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{consequence}} {{was that}} Oswald's education progressed {{at a speed}} that would, in these more rigid days, be deemed impossible.

In those days rough knocks were readily given, and the idea that there was anything objectionable, in a boy being struck, had never been entertained by anyone. Wives were beaten not uncommonly, servants frequently; and from the highest to the lowest, corporal punishment was regarded as the only way to ensure the carrying out of orders.|$|R
