50|$|In the United States, {{instruments}} {{required for}} IFR flight {{in addition to}} those that are required for VFR flight are: heading indicator, sensitive altimeter adjustable for barometric pressure, <b>clock</b> with a <b>sweep-second</b> <b>pointer</b> or digital equivalent, attitude indicator, radios and suitable avionics for the route to be flown, alternator or generator, gyroscopic rate-of-turn indicator that is either a turn coordinator or the turn and bank indicator. From 1999 single-engine helicopters could not be FAA-certified for IFR, and Helicopter Association International estimates that 326 lives were lost in 133 accidents that would likely not have happened if those helicopters had been flying in IFR.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel design of address pointer for FIFO memory circuits. Advantages {{of the proposed}} design include: reduced capacitive load on the <b>pointer</b> <b>clock</b> path, {{the use of a}} true single-phase clock, and double- edge-triggering clock scheme. The circuit has low power consumption, is immune to circuit racing conditions and suitable for high-speed operations. Techniques to implement <b>clock</b> gating in <b>pointer</b> circuit design for further reducing power consumption are also discussed. The proposed circuit is implemented with a 65 nm CMOS technology and its performance is compared with previous pointer circuits...|$|R
40|$|The power {{consumption}} {{has become an}} important consideration on the VLSI system design. It is necessary to determine the sources of {{power consumption}} {{so that they can}} be removed or reduced, allowing for better overall performance of the system. This paper presents use of low power double edge- triggered address pointer circuit used for FIFO memory design. Proposed circuit is implemented with 65 nm CMOS technology. Circuit simulations are performed to verify the function of the proposed circuit and compare its performance with other designs. The power consumption, clock to output delay, and power-delay product are also compared through circuit simulations. Circuit simulations are performed to demonstrate the proposed clock gating technique. The proposed design results in significant reduction on the cumulative capacitive load on the <b>pointer</b> <b>clock</b> path and hence consume less power compared to other designs...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{developed}} low-power circuit technique for Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) address pointers used in First-In First-Out (FIFO) memories. Traditionally, pointer circuits for FIFO memories {{can be implemented}} by using shift register. However such traditional way of implementation increases the number of flip-flops {{with the increase of}} the size of the memory. Since the pointer operation is triggered by clock signals, traditional implementation imposes heavy capacitive load on the clock path of the pointer circuit which results in large power consumption of the circuit. 	We developed a novel pointer circuit which results in significant capacitive load reduction. The new design consists of two types of basic cells referred to as N-cell and P-cell. With this new design each pointer stage only contributes a single gate capacitance to the <b>pointer</b> <b>clock</b> signal path. Also double-edge-triggered clock scheme is used in the design to reduce the switching activities and hence the power consumption on the clock path. Finally, clock gating techniques are presented to further minimize the capacitive load on the <b>clock</b> signal path. <b>Pointer</b> circuits of the proposed design have been implemented using a 65 nm CMOS technology. Circuit simulations demonstrate the developed pointer circuit consumes significant less power than the previously proposed low-power pointer circuits implemented with the same technology. The simulation also shows that the proposed circuit is suitable for low voltage applications...|$|R
5000|$|The device {{consisted}} of a circular dial with a single central rotating <b>pointer,</b> like a <b>clock.</b> The dial was engraved with the ranges in yards. The clockwork motor drove the pointer at a constant rate determined by a control on the right hand side of the device. This had a handle and its own dial, on which {{the rate of change}} of range (or [...] "range rate") could be selected. This was calculated by other means, often by use of a Dumaresq or a time-and-range plot. A second rotating handle was fitted {{to the left of the}} clock. This was connected by gears to the dial plate, which rather than being fixed as on a clock, could be rotated. One turn of the handle would rotate the scale 100 yd relative to the <b>pointer.</b> Thus the <b>clock</b> could be set to the initial range to a ship, or corrections could be made to update the reading without disturbing the mechanism.|$|R

This includes a new clock for Father Fouras' riddle, which {{is divided into three}} sections, 30, 20, and 10. Should the team member solve the riddle in time, the amount of time added is determined by the section the <b>clock</b> <b>pointer</b> is in, meaning the riddle is worth less time the longer it takes to solve it.|$|R

The objective was to determine the effectiveness of the watery extract of Euphorbia lactea Haw for the control of Plutella xylostella L. in the cabbage crop (Brassica oleracea L.). Bioprepared was obtained fractioning pieces among 3 to 5 cm of young shafts of E. lactea in mature plants of 2 - 3 m of height. 3 kg of the vegetable fractions was deposited in 10 L of water, (proportion 0, 3 kg L- 1), remaining the mixture in rest during 24 hours.

40|$|It {{is usually}} {{assumed that the}} "t" {{parameter}} in the equations of dynamics can be identified with the indication of the <b>pointer</b> of a <b>clock.</b> Things are not so easy, however. In fact, since the equations of motion can be written in terms of t but also of t'=f(t), f being any well behaved function, {{each one of those}} infinite parametric times t' is as good as the Newtonian one to study classical dynamics. Here we show that the relation between the mathematical parametric time t in the equations of dynamics and the physical dynamical time Ïƒ that is measured with clocks is more complex and subtle than usually assumed. These two times, therefore, must be carefully distinguished since their difference may have significant consequences. Furthermore, we show that not all the dynamical clock-times are necessarily equivalent and that the observational fingerprint of this non-equivalence has the same form as that of the Pioneer anomaly.

40|$|The {{statistical}} {{state of}} any (classical or quantum) system with non-trivial time evolution {{can be interpreted}} as the <b>pointer</b> of a <b>clock.</b> The quality of such a clock is given by the statistical distinguishability of its states at different times. If a clock is used as a resource for producing another one the latter can at most have the quality of the resource. We show that this principle, formalized by a quasi-order, implies constraints on many physical processes. Similarly, the degree to which two (quantum or classical) clocks are synchronized can be formalized by a quasi-order of synchronism. Copying timing information is restricted by quantum no-cloning and no-broadcasting theorems since classical clocks can only exist in the limit of infinite energy. We show this quantitatively by comparing the Fisher timing information of two output systems to the input's timing information. For classical signal processing in the quantum regime our results imply that a signal looses its localization in time if it is amplified and distributed to many devices.

50|$|The Naranjo de Bulnes make up, {{together}} with the mountains in its range, the Jou Tras El Picu, a circle of mountains which create within its hollow center so spectacular a depth. Starting {{from the north and}} following the <b>pointer</b> of the <b>clock,</b> appears the Carnizoso tower (2,332 m), the Oso (Bear) tower (2,461 m), the Risco Victor (Victor Craig) and the falsely named Collada Bonita (Beautiful Hill), the Martinez Spire (2,422 m) from where it descends to the Collada Bonita (2,382 m), a favored place to observe the southern face of the Picu. Continuing towards the south appears the Colladetas Tower (2,456 M) and next the Morra (Hill), a two-headed summit that has a maximum height of 2,554 meters, which {{is supposed to be the}} tallest of all the surrounding mountains, {{together with}} the Naranjo, the Jou Tras El Picu. The western area of the Jou Tras el Uriellu is covered by the Tiros de la Torca (2,386 m), the southern edge of the Picu Urriellu 2,519 m), from the start of the Canal de la Celada to the Vega de Uriellu.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{approaches}} {{to the problem of}} defining arrival and dwell time probabilities in quantum theory make use of idealised models of clocks. An interesting question {{is the extent to which}} the probabilities obtained in this way are related to standard semiclassical results. In this paper we explore this question using a reasonably general clock model, solved using path integral methods. We find that in the weak coupling regime where the energy of the clock is much less than the energy of the particle it is measuring, the probability for the <b>clock</b> <b>pointer</b> can be expressed in terms of the probability current in the case of arrival times, and the dwell time operator in the case of dwell times, the expected semiclassical results. In the regime of strong system-clock coupling, we find that the arrival time probability is proportional to the kinetic energy density, consistent with an earlier model involving a complex potential. We argue that, properly normalized, this may be the generically expected result in this regime. We show that these conclusions are largely independent of the form of the clock Hamiltonian.

40|$|It {{is usually}} {{assumed that the}} t {{parameter}} in the equations of dynamics can be identified with the indication of the <b>pointer</b> of a <b>clock.</b> Things are not so simple, however. In fact, because the equations of motion can be written in terms of t but {{also in terms of}} t' = f(t), f being any well-behaved function, any one of those infinite parametric times t' is as good as the newtonian one to study classical dynamics in hamiltonian form. Here we show that, as a consequence of parametric invariance, one of the foundations of classical dynamics, the relation between the mathematical parametric time t in the equations of dynamics and the physical dynamical time sigma that is measured with a particular clock (which is itself a dynamical system) requires the characterization of the clock that is used to achieve a complete treatment of dynamical systems. These two kinds of time, therefore, must be carefully distinguished. Furthermore, we show that not all the dynamical clock-times are necessarily equivalent and that the observational fingerprint of this nonequivalence has, curiously, the same form as that of the Pioneer anomaly. This suggests, therefore, that an acceleration to one another of the astronomical and the atomic times, t(astr) and t(atom), can contribute to the total amount of the anomaly...|$|R
