M85 (NGC 4382), considered elliptical or lenticular, {{is one of the}} cluster's brighter members at magnitude nine. M85 is interacting with the <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxy</b> NGC 4394 and the elliptical galaxy MCG-3-32-38. M88 (NGC 4501) is a multi-arm <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxy</b> seen at about 30° from edge-on. It has a highly-regular shape with well-developed, symmetrical arms. Among the first galaxies recognized as spiral, it has a supermassive black hole in its center. M91 (NGC 4548), a barred <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxy</b> with a bright, diffuse nucleus, is the faintest object in Messier's catalog at magnitude 10.2. M98 (NGC 4192), a bright, elongated <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxy</b> seen nearly edge-on, appears elliptical because of its unusual angle. The magnitude-10 galaxy has no redshift. M99 (NGC 4254) is a <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxy</b> seen face-on. Like M98 it is of magnitude-10 and has an unusually long arm on its west side. M100 (NGC 4321), a magnitude-nine <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxy</b> seen face-on, is one of the cluster's brightest. Photographs reveal a brilliant core, two prominent spiral arms, an array of secondary arms and several dust lanes.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} recent {{claims that}} the Hubble sequence of <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> is scale-free. Fundamental to this investigation {{is the fact that}} within the photometric data of 86 <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> from de Jong & van der Kruit - from which these claims were made - a trend exists between morphological type and bulge profile shape. While late-type spiral bulges are described by an exponential luminosity profile, the early-type spiral bulges are better described by an r 1 / 2 or r 1 / 4 law. Taking the scale lengths from the best-fitting surface brightness profile models (i. e., either using exponential, r 1 / 2, or r 1 / 4 law profile parameters), we show that in all six passbands used (BVRIHK), the early-type <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> have a larger re/h ratio than late-type <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies.</b> In contrast to this, fitting an exponential profile to the bulges of all <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> results in the mean re/h ratio for the early-type <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> actually being smaller than the mean re/h ratio for the late-type <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> (at the 3 o significance level using K-band data) ...|$|R

It is 7.2 by 4.2 arcminutes, meaning that its surface brightness, magnitude 13.6, is significantly lower than its integrated magnitude.

The main arm, on the northwest side of the galaxy, is home to many star forming regions; this is due to previous gravitational interactions with other galaxies.

40|$|Abstract It is {{proposed}} that the arms of <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> are formed by the continuous outflow of matter from their centers. It is then shown that the ratio between the radial and tangential velocit ies of the outflow is the parameter responsible for the logarithmic spiral structure of <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies.</b> The fitting of some <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> to the model allows the calcu lation of the expansion velocities of matter in these galaxies and such values completely agree with the observational data. An approximate universal equation {{is proposed}} for {{the description of the}} arms of <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> with or without bars. Some important consequences are discussed with respect to dark matter, galactic evolution, cosmology, and the Milky Way.

40|$|Passive <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> — unusual <b>galaxies</b> with <b>spiral</b> {{morphology}} {{without any}} sign of ongoing star formation — have recently been discovered to exist preferentially in cluster infalling regions (at about the virial radius, or at a local galaxy density of ∼ 1 Mpc − 2). The discovery directly connects the passive <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> to the cluster galaxy evolution studies such as the Butcher-Oemler effect or the morphology-density relation, i. e., passive <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{are likely to be}} transition objects between high-z blue, <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> and low-z red, cluster early-type galaxies.

However, in previous work, passive <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> are selected from the low resolution optical images with ∼ 1. 5 arcsec of seeing. Therefore, passive spirals could be a mis-identification of S 0 galaxies; or dusty-starburst galaxies which are not passive at all. To answer these questions, we performed a deep, high-resolution, near-infrared imaging of 32 passive <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Our high resolution K band images show clear spiral arm structures. Thus, passive spirals are not S 0 s. Optical-infrared colour does not show any signs of dusty-starburst at all.

40|$|Passive <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies,</b> {{despite their}} <b>spiral</b> {{morphological}} appearance, {{do not have}} any emission lines indicative of ongoing star formation in their optical spectra. Previous studies have suggested that passive <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> preferentially exist in infall regions of galaxy clusters, suggesting that the cluster environment is likely to be responsible for creating these galaxies. By carrying out spatially resolved long-slit spectroscopy on four nearby passive <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> with the Apache Point Observatory 3. 5 -m telescope, we investigated the stellar populations of passive <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> separately for their inner and outer regions. In the two unambiguously passive <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> among the four observed galaxies, Hδ absorption lines are more prominent in the outer regions of the galaxies, whereas the 4000 -Å breaks (D_ 4000) are strongest in the inner regions of the galaxies. A comparison with a simple stellar population model for the two passive <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> indicates that the outer regions of the galaxies tend to harbour younger populations of stars. The strong Hδ absorption observed in the outer regions of the sample galaxies is consistent with that of galaxies whose star formation ceased a few Gyrs ago. Because of the large uncertainty in the absorption indices in our samples, further observations are needed in order to place constraints on the mechanisms that quench star formation in passive <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Comment: MNRAS, 382, 27...|$|R
