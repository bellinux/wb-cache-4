40|$|In {{the retina}} of {{trichromatic}} primates, chromatic information is encoded in an opponent fashion and {{transmitted to the}} lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and visual cortex via parallel pathways. Chromatic selectivities of neurons in the LGN form two separate clusters, corresponding to two classes of cone opponency. In the visual cortex, however, the chromatic selectivities are more distributed, which is in accordance with a population code for colour. Previous studies of <b>cone</b> <b>signals</b> in natural scenes typically found opponent codes with chromatic selectivities corresponding to two directions in colour space. Here we investigated how the nonlinear spatiochromatic filtering in the retina influences the encoding of colour <b>signals.</b> <b>Cone</b> <b>signals</b> were derived from hyperspectral images of natural scenes and pre-processed by centre-surround filtering and rectification, resulting in parallel ON and OFF channels. Independent Component Analysis on these signals yielded a highly sparse code with basis functions that showed spatio-chromatic selectivities. In contrast to previous analyses of linear transformations of <b>cone</b> <b>signals,</b> chromatic selectivities were not restricted to two main chromatic axes, but were more continuously distributed in colour space, similar to the population code of colour in the early visual cortex.

But what happens when both the spectrum and the geometry of the illumination change, as with lighting {{from the sun and}} sky? Is it possible, as a matter of principle, to obtain reliable cues by processing <b>cone</b> <b>signals</b> alone? This question was addressed here by estimating the information provided by <b>cone</b> <b>signals</b> from time-lapse hyperspectral radiance images of five outdoor scenes under natural lighting. The scenes contained mixtures of herbaceous vegetation, woodland, barren land, rock, and rural and urban buildings. For each scene, mutual information between <b>cone</b> <b>signals</b> was estimated at increasing time intervals. These estimates have an operational interpretation given by Shannon 2 ̆ 7 s channel-coding theorem. It sets a theoretical upper limit on the number of points that can be reliably identified across time by transforming <b>cone</b> <b>signals</b> alone. For all five scenes, the number of identifiable points declined markedly with increasing interval, although not always monotonically. This decline represents an irretrievable loss in information.

50|$|The {{conifers}} are serotinous, {{meaning they}} release seeds {{in response to}} an environmental trigger. Seed release in the forest relies on fire and shoot death. Shoot death is when death of a stem <b>signals</b> <b>cones</b> to release seeds. One example of serotiny due to shoot death is cupressaceae. Although shoot death can be cause by fire, there are other sources of stem death. Closed-cone forests rely on predictable, infrequent fires. The fires are stand-replacing crown fires. One example of serotiny due to fire is Pinacae releasing seed after the cone has undergone 200°C for five minutes. Sargent cypress, Gowan cypress, McNabb cypress, Monterrey Pine, and Torrey Pine are all California endemic serotinous conifer species. Serotiny offers benefits to plant species because after a fire, there is less competition for the seeds on the ground. Thus, the fire signals an advantageous time for trees to drop their seeds.|$|R

40|$|Background. At {{least twice}} daily our retinas move between a light adapted, cone-dominated (photopic) {{state and a}} dark-adapted, color-blind and highly {{light-sensitive}} roddominated (scotopic) state. In between is a rather ill-defined transitional state called the mesopic state in which retinal circuits express both rod and <b>cone</b> <b>signals.</b> Consequently, in the mesopic state the retinal output to the brain contained in the firing patterns of the ganglion cells consists of information derived from both rod and <b>cone</b> <b>signals.</b> Morphology, physiology and psychophysics all contributed to an understanding that the two systems are not independent but interact extensively via both pooling and mutual inhibition. This review lays down a rationale for such rod-cone interactions in the vertebrate retinas. It suggests that the important functional roles of rod-cone interactions is in that they shorten {{the duration of the}} mesopic state. As a result, the retina is maintained in either in the (rod-dominated) high sensitivity photon counting mode or in the second mode which emphasizes temporal transients and spatial resolution (the cone-dominated photopic state). Conclusions. Experimental evidence for pre- and postsynaptic mixing of rod and <b>cone</b> <b>signals</b> in the retina is shown together with the preeminent neuromodulatory role of both light and dopamine in controling inter-actions between rod and <b>cone</b> <b>signals.</b> Dopamine is shown to be both necessary and sufficient to mediate light adaptation in the retina. </p...|$|R

For American sycamore and sugar maple trees, the fruits did not affect the total backscatter unless they were packed in clusters.

40|$|ABSTRACT In lower vertebrates, cone retinomotor {{movements}} {{occur in}} response to changes in lighting conditions and to an endogenous circadian clock. In the light, cone myoids contract, while in the dark, they elongate. In order {{to test the hypothesis}} that melatonin and dopamine may be involved in the regulation of cone movement, we have used an in vitro eyecup preparation from Xenopus laevis that sustains light- and dark-adaptive cone retinomotor movement. Melatonin mimics darkness by causing cone elongation. Dark- and melatonin-induced cone elongation are blocked by dopamine. Dopamine also stimulates cone contraction in dark-adapted eyecups. The effect of dopamine appears to be mediated specifically by a dopamine receptor, possibly of the D 2 type. The dopamine agonist apomorphine and the putative D 2 agonist LY 171555 induced cone contraction. In contrast, the putative D, agonist SKF 38393 -A and specific a,-, a 2 -, and / 3 -adrenergic receptor agonists were without effect. Furthermore, the dopamine antagonist spiroperidol not only blocked light-induced cone contraction, but also stimulated cone elongation in the light. These results suggest that dopamine is part of the light <b>signal</b> for <b>cone</b> contraction, and that its suppression is part of the dark <b>signal</b> for <b>cone</b> elongation.

The H 1 cell has both a cone-connected dendritic tree and a long axon-like process that terminates in a rod-connected arbor. We recorded from the H 1 cell body where rod signals were distinguished by sensitivity to short wavelength light after dark adaptation. Receptive fields of rod vs. cone mediated responses were coextensive, indicating that the rod signal is transmitted via rod–cone gap junctions. Sensitivity of the H 1 cell rod signal was ∼ 1 log unit {{higher than that of}} the <b>cone</b> <b>signal.</b> Below <b>cone</b> threshold rod <b>signals</b> were temporally low-pass, with a cutoff frequency below 10 Hz.

40|$|Chromatic {{adaptation}} transforms generally rely on {{a variant}} of the von Kries transformation method to account for changes in the LMS <b>cone</b> <b>signals</b> that occur when changing from one illuminant to another. Von Kries adaptation—also {{often referred to as the}} coefficient rule method or the diagonal transformation method—adjusts the 3 color channels by independent scale factors. Since there generally are only 3 known quantities available, namely the ratio of the <b>cone</b> <b>signals</b> of the two adapting illuminants, a crucial aspect of the von Kries method is that it requires only 3 parameters to be specified. A 9 -parameter, 3 x 3 matrix transformation would be more accurate, but it is generally not possible to determine the extra parameters. This paper presents a novel method of predicting the effect a change of illumination has on the <b>cone</b> <b>signals,</b> while still relying on only 3 parameters. To begin, we create a large set of 3 x 3 matrices representing illuminant changes based on a sizable database of typical illuminant spectra and surface spectral reflectances. Representing these 3 x 3 matrices as points in a 9 dimensional space, we then apply principal components analysis to find a 3 -dimensional basis which best approximates the original matrix space. To model an illumination change, a 3 x 3 matrix is constructed using a weighted combination of the 3 basis matrices. The relative weights can be calculated based on the 3 standard cone ratios obtained from the illuminant pair. Tests show that the new method yields better results than von Kries adaptation with or without sensor sharpening...|$|R

One observer was also {{the subject of the}} preceding paper (Alpern & Kitahara, 1983) in which the field sensitivities of his foveal IIj(mu) (j = 3, 4, 5) mechanisms for normally, and obliquely, incident backgrounds were reported. For normal incidence, the colour matching functions are in rough accord with expectation if the action spectra of the three cone mechanisms, which provide the photoreceptor basis for his trichromacy, were the same IIj mechanisms for normal incidence. A unified theory is developed for both Stiles-Crawford intensity and colour effects, assuming that the same visual pigments in the same set of univariantly <b>signalling</b> <b>cones</b> absorbs both the normal incident primaries and the obliquely incident test. Given no free parameters for curve fitting, the Stiles-Crawford intensity effect data are in reasonable agreement with the theory if the photoreceptor basis of these matches were the normally and obliquely incident IIj(mu) mechanisms. The Stiles-Crawford colour effect data contradict the expectations of the unified theory applied with these same IIj(mu) mechanisms.

In depolarized cones, the feedback-mediated response in second-order neurons had a similar time constant to that of the direct light response of the cone, whereas in hyperpolarized cones, the time constant of the feedback-mediated response in second-order neurons was considerably larger. Further, it was shown that there was no delay in the feedback pathway. This is in contrast to what has been deduced from the response properties of second-order neurons. In one type of horizontal cell, the responses to red light were delayed relative to the responses to green light.

The adapting and test lights were of equal luminance (35 cd/m 2) and differed from the standard grey adapting light either along the L− 2 M (red and green), or along the S−(L + M) (yellow and violet) line. The red (green) adapting light results in 6 % positive (negative) L cone contrast and 11 % negative (positive) M cone contrast {{with respect to the}} grey adapting light.

To address this question we employed the method used by Kingdom et al. (2010) to study suprathreshold interactions between luminance and colour contrast. The stimulus employed in one condition was similar to that used by Regan and Mollon (1997) for studying the relative ‘organizing power’ of the two sub-systems, and consisted of obliquely-oriented red-cyan (to isolate the L-M sub-system) and violet-chartreuse (to isolate the S sub-system) stripes within a lattice of circles. In our experiment there were two conditions, (1) the Separated condition, in which the L-M and S modulations were of opposite orientation and presented separately as a forced-choice pair, and (2) the Combined condition, in which the L-M and S modulations were added. In the Separated condition the task was to indicate the stimulus with the more salient orientation structure, whereas in the Combined condition the task was to indicate the orientation that was more salient. Psychometric functions were used to estimate the ratio of L-M to S contrast at the ‘balance-point’ i. e. point-of-subjective-equality (PSE) in both conditions. We found that across 20 subjects an average of 8 % more S than L-M contrast was needed to achieve a PSE in the Combined compared to Separated condition. We consider possible reasons for this PSE difference and conclude that it is either due to an early-stage interaction between the S and L-M sub-systems, or to a later stage in which new colours that arise from their combination are selectively grouped...|$|R
40|$|In bright light, cone-photoreceptors {{are active}} and colour vision derives from a {{comparison}} of <b>signals</b> in <b>cones</b> with different visual pigments. This comparison begins in the retina, where certain retinal ganglion cells have ‘colour-opponent’ visual responses—excited by light of one colour and suppressed by another colour. In dim light, rod-photoreceptors are active, but colour vision is impossible because they all use the same visual pigment. Instead, the rod signals are thought to splice into retinal circuits at various points, in synergy with the <b>cone</b> <b>signals.</b> Here we report a new circuit for colour vision that challenges these expectations. A genetically identified type of mouse retinal ganglion cell called JAMB (J-RGC), {{was found to have}} colour-opponent responses, OFF to ultraviolet (UV) light and ON to green light. Although the mouse retina contains a green-sensitive cone, the ON response instead originates in rods. Rods and cones both contribute to the response over several decades of light intensity. Remarkably, the rod signal in this circuit is antagonistic to that from cones. For rodents, this UV-green channel {{may play a role in}} social communication, as suggested by spectral measurements from the environment. In the human retina, all of the components for this circuit exist as well, and its function can explain certain experiences of colour in dim lights, such as a ‘blue shift’ in twilight. The discovery of this genetically defined pathway will enable new targeted studies of colour processing in the brain...|$|R
