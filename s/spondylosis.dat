5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is {{not common}} in the breed, although it occurs sufficiently often for many breeders to have their breeding stock tested. The Cattle Dog {{has a number of}} inherited conditions, but most of these are not common. Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year. Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (<b>spondylosis,</b> elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (pyometra, infertility, and false pregnancy), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and cruciate ligament tears as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.|$|E
25|$|The breed may be {{vulnerable}} to skin allergies, urinary tract infections (UTI), and autoimmune diseases. <b>Spondylosis</b> and osteoarthritis are common in older dogs.|$|E
25|$|Spondylosis*, {{known as}} <b>spondylosis</b> deformans in dogs, is growth of osteophytes on the ventral and lateral {{surfaces}} of the vertebral bodies. It is usually an incidental finding on radiographs and rarely causes symptoms.|$|E
25|$|One of the zoo's tigers, Soyono, was euthanized in November 2012. She was 19 years old, {{which is}} close to the limits of her life span. The tiger looked to be {{suffering}} from <b>spondylosis,</b> a degenerative spinal disorder, which afflicts big cats as they get older.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} locations have no discs and {{are therefore}} exempt from the risk of disc herniation: the upper two cervical intervertebral spaces, the sacrum, and the coccyx. Most disc herniations occur {{when a person is}} in their thirties or forties when the nucleus pulposus is still a gelatin-like substance. With age the nucleus pulposus changes ("dries out") and the risk of herniation is greatly reduced. After age 50 or 60, osteoarthritic degeneration (<b>spondylosis)</b> or spinal stenosis are more likely causes of low back pain or leg pain.|$|E
25|$|In early 2011 she was {{diagnosed}} with cervical <b>spondylosis</b> or cervical radiculopathy. She was rushed to the St. Luke's Medical Center in Global City Taguig July 25, 2011, minutes after the State of the Nation Address by Benigno Aquino III. Doctors performed a 5-hour spine surgery on July 29, 2011 Two more surgeries occurred in August 2011 which aggravated her hypoparathyroidism. The House of Representatives under the leadership of Speaker Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. issued a travel permit allowing her to have treatment in Germany despite the Department of Justice hold departure order.|$|E
500|$|SCI {{can also}} be of a nontraumatic origin. Nontraumatic lesions cause {{anywhere}} from 30 to 80% of all SCI; the percentage varies by locale, influenced by efforts to prevent trauma. Developed countries have higher percentages of SCI due to degenerative conditions and tumors than developing countries. [...] In developed countries, {{the most common cause}} of nontraumatic SCI is degenerative diseases, followed by tumors; in many developing countries the leading cause is infection such as HIV and tuberculosis. SCI may occur in intervertebral disc disease, and spinal cord vascular disease. Spontaneous bleeding can occur within or outside of the protective membranes that line the cord, and intervertebral disks can herniate. Damage can result from dysfunction of the blood vessels, as in arteriovenous malformation, or when a blood clot becomes lodged in a blood vessel and cuts off blood supply to the cord. When systemic blood pressure drops, blood flow to the spinal cord may be reduced, potentially causing a loss of sensation and voluntary movement in the areas supplied by the affected level of the spinal cord. Congenital conditions and tumors that compress the cord can also cause SCI, as can vertebral <b>spondylosis</b> and ischemia. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that can damage the spinal cord, as can infectious or inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis, herpes zoster or herpes simplex, meningitis, myelitis, and syphilis.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{conditions}} that involve {{the central nervous}} system may lead to vertigo including: [...] lesions caused by infarctions or hemorrhage, tumors present in the cerebellopontine angle such as a vestibular schwannoma or cerebellar tumors, epilepsy, cervical spine disorders such as cervical <b>spondylosis,</b> degenerative ataxia disorders, migraine headaches, lateral medullary syndrome, Chiari malformation, multiple sclerosis, parkinsonism, as well as cerebral dysfunction. Central vertigo may not improve or may do so more slowly than vertigo caused by disturbance to peripheral structures.|$|E
2500|$|Therapeutic use of qigong is {{directed}} by TCM, CAM, integrative medicine, and other health practitioners. [...] In China, where it is considered a [...] "standard medical technique", qigong is commonly prescribed to treat {{a wide variety of}} conditions, and clinical applications include hypertension, coronary artery disease, peptic ulcers, chronic liver diseases, diabetes mellitus, obesity, menopause syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, insomnia, tumors and cancer, lower back and leg pain, cervical <b>spondylosis,</b> and myopia. [...] Outside China qigong is used in integrative medicine to complement or supplement accepted medical treatments, including for relaxation, fitness, rehabilitation, and treatment of specific conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Radiological {{examination}} of Ötzi's bones showed [...] "age-conditioned or strain-induced degeneration" [...] corresponding to many tattooed areas, including osteochondrosis and slight <b>spondylosis</b> in the lumbar spine and wear-and-tear degeneration {{in the knee}} {{and especially in the}} ankle joints. It has been speculated that these tattoos may have been related to pain relief treatments similar to acupressure or acupuncture. If so, this is at least 2,000 years before their previously known earliest use in China (c. 1000 BCE). Recent research into archaeological evidence for ancient tattooing has confirmed that Ötzi is the oldest tattooed human mummy yet discovered.|$|E
2500|$|Leading {{health issues}} to which Boxers are prone include cancers, heart {{conditions}} such as aortic stenosis and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (the so-called [...] "Boxer cardiomyopathy"), hypothyroidism, hip dysplasia, and degenerative myelopathy and epilepsy; other conditions that may be seen are gastric dilatation volvulus (also known as bloat), intestinal problems, and allergies (although these may be more related to diet than breed). Entropion, a malformation of the eyelid requiring surgical correction, is occasionally seen, and some lines have a tendency toward <b>spondylosis</b> deformans, a fusing of the spine, or dystocia. Other conditions that are less common but occur more often in Boxers than other breeds are hystiocytic ulcerative colitis (sometimes called Boxer colitis), an invasive E. coli infection, and indolent corneal ulcers, often called Boxer eye ulcers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spondylosis</b> {{is caused}} {{from years of}} {{constant}} abnormal pressure, from joint subluxation, sports, or poor posture, being placed on the vertebrae, and the discs between them. The abnormal stress causes the body to form new bone in order {{to compensate for the}} new weight distribution. This abnormal weight bearing from bone displacement will cause <b>spondylosis</b> to occur. Poor postures and loss of the normal spinal curves can lead to <b>spondylosis</b> as well. <b>Spondylosis</b> can affect a person at any age; however, older people are more susceptible.|$|E
50|$|Examples include {{ankylosing}} spondylitis and <b>spondylosis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 55% of facet {{syndrome}} cases {{occur in}} cervical vertebrae, and 31% in lumbar. Facet syndrome can progress to spinal osteoarthritis, {{which is known}} as <b>spondylosis.</b> Pathology of the C1-C2 (atlantoaxial) joint, the most mobile of all vertebral segments, accounts for 4% of all <b>spondylosis.</b>|$|E

5000|$|There are {{multiple}} techniques {{used in the}} diagnosis of <b>Spondylosis,</b> these are; ...|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, {{that the cause}} of <b>spondylosis</b> is simply old age, and that posture {{modification}} treatment is often practiced by those who have a financial interest (such as Worker's Compensation) in proving that it is caused by work conditions and poor physical habits. Understanding anatomy is the key to conservative management of <b>spondylosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Eperisone also {{improves}} dizziness and tinnitus {{associated with}} cerebrovascular disorders or cervical <b>spondylosis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Many of the {{treatments}} for cervical <b>spondylosis</b> {{have not been}} subjected to rigorous, controlled trials. Surgery is advocated for cervical radiculopathy in patients who have intractable pain, progressive symptoms, or weakness that fails to improve with conservative therapy. Surgical indications for cervical <b>spondylosis</b> with myelopathy (CSM) remain somewhat controversial, but [...] "most clinicians recommend operative therapy over conservative therapy for moderate-to-severe myelopathy." [...] (Baron, M.E.) ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{the space}} between two {{adjacent}} vertebrae narrows, compression of a nerve root emerging from the spinal cord may result in radiculopathy (sensory and motor disturbances, such as severe pain in the neck, shoulder, arm, back, or leg, accompanied by muscle weakness). Less commonly, direct pressure on the spinal cord (typically in the cervical spine) may result in myelopathy, characterized by global weakness, gait dysfunction, loss of balance, and loss of bowel or bladder control. The patient may experience shocks (paresthesia) in hands and legs because of nerve compression and lack of blood flow. If vertebrae of the neck are involved it is labelled cervical <b>spondylosis.</b> Lower back <b>spondylosis</b> is labeled lumbar <b>spondylosis.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Spondylosis</b> (from Ancient Greek σπόνδυλος spóndylos, [...] "a vertebra", in plural [...] "vertebrae - the backbone") {{is a broad}} term meaning {{degeneration}} of {{the spinal}} column from any cause. In the more narrow sense it refers to spinal osteoarthrosis, the age-related wear and tear of the spinal column, {{which is the most}} common cause of <b>spondylosis.</b> The degenerative process in osteoarthritis chiefly affects the vertebral bodies, the neural foramina and the facet joints (facet syndrome). If severe, it may cause pressure on nerve roots with subsequent sensory or motor disturbances, such as pain, paresthesia, and muscle weakness in the limbs.|$|E
50|$|Current {{surgical}} procedures {{used to treat}} <b>spondylosis</b> aim to alleviate the {{signs and symptoms of}} the disease by decreasing pressure in the spinal canal (decompression surgery) and/or by controlling spine movement (fusion surgery).|$|E
5000|$|... 2. {{degenerative}} disc disease (<b>spondylosis).</b> The disc {{consists of}} about 80% water. When one grows older, the disc starts {{to dry out}} and shrink, causing small tears in the annulus and inflammation of the nerve root.|$|E
