50|$|The third CNC axis always {{moves the}} {{cylinder}} exactly over the tool, which keeps the wear on the bearings and tools to a minimum. All pieces are sent down a <b>slat</b> <b>conveyor</b> and are pushed sideways on a table. Any scrap is {{carried to the}} end of the conveyor and dropped into a bin. Different workpieces can be produced within one work cycle to optimize production.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} stresses in a link of a <b>slat</b> chain <b>conveyor</b> {{loaded with}} rock mass. Tensometric data and results from numerical simulation with Finite Element Method (FEM) are used. The tensometric measurements are performed {{in real life}} conditions. For numerical simulation an adequate model with FEM has been created. The adequacy of the model is confirmed by the comparison of the experimental and numerical results. The factor of safety used {{in the design of}} the conveyor links is determined...|$|R
