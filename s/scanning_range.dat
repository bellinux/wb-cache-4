25|$|In {{frequency}} domain OCT (FD-OCT) the broadband interference is acquired with spectrally separated detectors (either by encoding the optical frequency {{in time with}} a spectrally scanning source or with a dispersive detector, like a grating and a linear detector array). Due to the Fourier relation (Wiener-Khintchine theorem between the auto correlation and the spectral power density) the depth scan can be immediately calculated by a Fourier-transform from the acquired spectra, without movement of the reference arm. This feature improves imaging speed dramatically, while the reduced losses during a single scan improve the {{signal to noise ratio}} proportional to the number of detection elements. The parallel detection at multiple wavelength ranges limits the <b>scanning</b> <b>range,</b> while the full spectral bandwidth sets the axial resolution.|$|E

In this study,a novel 8 -element linear array of polarisation reconﬁgurable antennas conformed to four different array structures; namely 2 -faceted, 3 -faceted, 4 -faceted and 8 -faceted are analysed and synthesised. Observations are made on the inﬂuence of the tilting angle of the faceted structures to the geometrical characteristics and the <b>scan</b> <b>range</b> of the array. It is shown that the 3 -faceted array can achieve the widest <b>scan</b> <b>range</b> with the smallest dimension compared with the other faceted structures.

The <b>scan</b> <b>range</b> of the bent antenna array can be significantly increased by a proper choice of the array bending angle, antenna element number, and element beamwidth. A bent array based on the BFACP antenna is presented as an example.

50|$|There {{are some}} {{shortcomings}} or difficulties {{when working with}} an MFM, such as: the recorded image depends {{on the type of}} the tip and magnetic coating, due to tip-sample interactions. Magnetic field of the tip and sample can change each other's magnetization, M, which can result in nonlinear interactions. This hinders image interpretation. Relatively short lateral <b>scanning</b> <b>range</b> (order of hundreds micrometers). Scanning (lift) height affects the image.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of speckle reduction using traditional frame averaging technique was limited in ultrahigh speed {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT). As the motion between repeated frames was very small, the speckle pattern of the frames might be identical. This problem could be solved by averaging frames acquired at slightly different locations. The optimized <b>scan</b> <b>range</b> depended on the spot size of the laser beam, the smoothness of the boundary, and the homogeneity of the tissue. In this study we presented a method to average frames obtained within a narrow range along the slow-axis. A swept-source OCT with 100, 000 Hz axial scan rate was used to scan the retina in vivo. A series of narrow raster scans (0 - 50 micron along the slow axis) were evaluated. Each scan contained 20 image frames evenly distributed in the <b>scan</b> <b>range.</b> The imaging frame rate was 417 HZ. Only frames with high correlation after rigid registration were used in averaging. The result showed that the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) increased with the <b>scan</b> <b>range.</b> But the best edge reservation was obtained with 15 micron <b>scan</b> <b>range.</b> Thus, for ultrahigh speed OCT systems, averaging frames from a narrow band along the slow-axis could achieve better speckle reduction than traditional frame averaging techniques...|$|R

40|$|The {{manipulation}} of samples in {{atomic force microscopes}} (AFMs) is often performed using piezoelectric actuators. In this paper, a metrological AFM with a 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) stage driven by piezo-stack actuators is considered. The piezo actuators exhibit hysteresis, which can change the system dynamics and/or acts as a non-linear disturbance on the system. This deteriorates {{the performance of the}} AFM. The 3 DOF stage exhibits asymmetric hysteresis, which is modeled by extending the Coleman-Hodgdon model. The asymmetry includes a <b>scan</b> <b>range</b> dependent offset and an asymmetry between the trace and retrace directions. Non-linear multi-variable optimization is employed to derive the optimal generic model for all <b>scan</b> <b>ranges.</b> The proposed extended Coleman-Hodgdon model describes the asymmetric hysteresis over all <b>scan</b> <b>ranges</b> with an accuracy of 97 %. Based on the model, a feedforward compensation method is developed. Experiments on the metrological AFM show that the application of the hysteresis feedforward largely improves the scanning accuracy...|$|R

The efficiency of the array is 0. 96 which is an important result considering that 50 W is to be applied to each element. The antenna element used in the array was based on a design developed during the specialization project.
