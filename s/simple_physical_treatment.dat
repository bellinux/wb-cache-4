40|$|AbstractRice {{cultivation}} nowadays {{has become}} as major concern to Sri Lanka due to high dependency of chemical fertilizers. There is an interest to promote utilization of rice obtained from traditional rice varieties which are well adopted to Sri Lankan environmental conditions, such varieties are highly nutritious and less dependent on agrochemicals. Thus they are ideal candidates in promoting organic food products without chemical inputs. Rice flour is a good substitute for imported wheat flour in bakery industry. However {{due to lack of}} gluten protein, rice flour cannot be used directly in bakery products without any modifications. In this study rice grains derived from four traditional rice varieties namely Madathuwalu, Kaluhenati, Pachaperumal and Ratdal were subjected to freezing at - 20 oC (24 hours and 48 hours), hot water soaking at 80 oC (5 minutes and 10 minutes) individually and in dual combinations. Untreated rice flour served as the control and experiments were conducted in triplicates. Water Absorption Index (WAI), Water Solubility (WS), Swelling Power (SP) and pH values were measured in both treated and untreated rice flour. Results showed that these physical treatments to the rice grains brings about a significant difference (p< 0. 05) on the functional properties of rice flour both individual and in dual combinations. Strong correlation (p= 0. 000) was obtained between WAI and SP. Dual modification treatments were found to be highly effective in improving functional properties of all selected traditional rice varieties compared to the single modification. Freezing at - 20 oC for 48 hours was more effective than the 24 hours freezing to improve the functional properties. Therefore, this study proves that <b>simple</b> <b>physical</b> <b>treatment</b> methods such as freezing and hot water soaking could bring about a significant effect on the functional properties of traditional rice flour...|$|E
40|$|Active slag {{filters are}} an {{emerging}} technology for removing phosphorus (P) from wastewater. Currently, the lifespan of these filters {{is limited by}} their available reactive sites. An increasing number of researchers suggest that drying active filters can renew their P removal capacity, although there has only been one research paper that has achieved regeneration. Hence, this study investigated techniques to regenerate the P removal efficiency of exhausted melter slag filter media which had successfully treated effluent for 5 years in the field before becoming inactive. Several techniques were performed to expose fresh surface sites on the slag, including: (1) drying; (2) agitation; and (3) crushing of the slag granules. Crushing resulted in the best regeneration of P removal efficiency by the slag, however, after just 2 months the renewed P removal efficiency of the crushed slag fell back to a similar level to that exhibited by exhausted slag. Furthermore, {{none of the other}} physical methods caused long-term rejuvenation of the exhausted slag to remove P from effluent. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that none of the regeneration techniques exposed substantial new phosphorus adsorption sites on the slag granules. These findings therefore challenge the validity of the existing dogma that active slag filters can be effectively regenerated by <b>simple</b> <b>physical</b> <b>treatments,</b> indicating further research is required to optimise active filter performance.

40|$|Problem statement: Decorticated {{sesame seed}} can supply us with nutritious, {{functional}} and healthy meals with relatively low cost. These properties make sesame a valuable {{source of protein}} and other nutrients to be utilized in imitated dairy products, {{which could be used}} for infant and adults with lactose intolerance as well as for vegetarian or others who like to eat dairy products free from cholesterol. Additionally, the production of sesame-based dairy products can overcome the problems that limit consumption of soy-based dairy products such as antinutritional factors, flavor and flatulence. The major challenges in developing dairy analogs from plant sources are: unacceptable flavor, low solids yield and low dispersion stability. Approach: The following factors were investigated to increase/optimize the sesame milk yield, dispersion stability and sensory acceptance: pretreatment of sesame seed with <b>simple</b> <b>physical</b> <b>treatments</b> (soaking in water, boiling, pressure cooking, steaming and combination treatments) and heat treatment of sesame milk (pasteurization or sterilization). Results: Heat treatments during all steps of processing proved {{to be the most important}} factor in determining the yield and quality of sesame milk. The best treatment was pasteurized sesame milk (75 °C for 5 min) with 12 % initial sesame seed concentration (previously dried at 170 °C for 5 sec) and formulated with the addition of 2 % sucrose. Conclusion: The developed procedure for sesame milk production resulted in high yield, excellent dispersion stability and good sensory acceptability...|$|R

The objective of this study is to consider the effects of periodicay ozonation, hydrogen peroxide <b>treatment,</b> and <b>physical</b> <b>treatment</b> capability in hatching rate enhancement. Three concentrations of 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 15 ppm ozone (10 min) and peroxide hydrogen with dose of 500 and 1000 ppm in two procedures accompanied with <b>physical</b> <b>treatment</b> and without <b>physical</b> <b>treatment</b> were examined on hatching rate.

From the economic viewpoint, 0. 05 ppm ozone with <b>physical</b> <b>treatment,</b> due to considerable minimizing at consumption energy and ozonation system retention costs, indicated as the best treatment than other ozone treatments for fungal control.

Objectives: The efficacy of mechanical insufflation– exsufflation, {{in addition to}} standard chest <b>physical</b> <b>treatments,</b> was investigated as a first-line intervention for patients with neuromuscular diseases with respiratory tract infections and airway mucous encumbrance. Design: The short-term outcomes of 11 consecutive neuromuscular disease patients with respiratory tract infections and tracheobronchial mucous encumbrance who were administered mechanical insufflation– exsufflation and conventional chest <b>physical</b> <b>treatments</b> in an intensive care unit were compared with the outcomes of 16 historical matched controls who had received chest <b>physical</b> <b>treatments</b> alone. Treatment failure {{was defined as the}} need for cricothyroid “minitracheostomy” or endotracheal intubation, despite treatment. The number of subjects administered bronchoscopy-assisted aspiration during the hospital stay was also compared. Results: Treatment failure was significantly lower (P 0. 05) in the mechanical insufflation– exsufflation group than in the conventional chest <b>physical</b> <b>treatments</b> group (2 / 11 vs. 10 / 16 cases). The use of bronchoscopy-assisted aspiration was similar in the two groups (5 / 11 vs. 6 / 16 cases). Mechanical insufflation– exsufflation did not produce serious side effects and was well tolerated by all subjects. Conclusions: Provision of mechanical insufflation– exsufflation in combination with standard chest <b>physical</b> <b>treatments</b> may improve the management of airway mucous encumbrance in neuromyopathic patients; its use {{should be included in the}} noninvasive approach to treatment of respiratory tract infections with impaired mucous clearance...|$|R
