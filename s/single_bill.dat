25|$|Altmire gained {{national}} attention for his {{leadership role in}} stopping the use of Chinese-made steel {{in the construction of}} the U.S.- Mexico border fence. In 2009, he authored the successful amendment that broke a long-running congressional stalemate that had for years delayed passage of an omnibus land conservation bill that combined dozens of different bills and covered millions of acres of public land. Following the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Altmire helped lead a high-profile rescue of two constituents and the 54 orphans under their care. In 2011, Altmire's legislation modernizing the federal charter of the American Legion gained the support of 432 cosponsors, the most cosponsors ever recorded for a <b>single</b> <b>bill</b> in U.S. House history.|$|E
25|$|Omnibus Housing Bill 1961. In March 1961 President Kennedy sent Congress {{a special}} message, proposing an ambitious and complex housing program to spur the economy, revitalize cities, and provide {{affordable}} housing for middle- and low-income families. The bill proposed spending $3.19billion and placed major emphasis on improving the existing housing supply, {{instead of on}} new housing starts, and creating a cabinet-level Department of Housing and Urban Affairs to oversee the programs. The bill also promised to make the Federal Housing Administration a full partner in urban renewal program by authorizing mortgage loans to finance rehabilitation of homes and urban renewal Committee on housing combined programs for housing, mass transportation, and open space land bills into a <b>single</b> <b>bill.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gomez, in his 2000 autobiography, {{wrote about}} Duke:He once {{presented}} a {{bill on the}} floor, {{one of the few}} which he had managed to get out of committee. He finished his opening presentation and strolled with great self-satisfaction back up the aisle to his seat. In his mind, he had spoken, made his presentation and that was that. Before he had even reached his desk and re-focused on the proceedings, another first-term member had been recognized for the floor and immediately moved to table the bill. The House voted for the motions effectively killing the bill. That and similar procedures were used against him many times. Gomez said that he recalls Duke obtaining the passage of only a <b>single</b> <b>bill,</b> legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences.|$|E

500|$|As a candidate, Carter had {{proposed}} {{health care reform}} that included key features of Kennedy's national health insurance bill, but in December 1977, President Carter told Kennedy his bill must be changed to preserve a large role for private insurance companies, minimize federal spending (precluding payroll tax financing), and be phased-in so as to not interfere with Carter's paramount domestic policy objectiveâ€”balancing the federal budget. Kennedy and labor compromised and made the requested changes, but broke with Carter in July 1978 when he would not commit to pursuing a <b>single</b> <b>bill</b> with a fixed schedule for phasing-in comprehensive coverage. Frustrated by Carter's budgetary concerns and political caution, in a December 1978 speech on national health insurance at the Democratic midterm convention, Kennedy said regarding liberal goals overall that [...] "sometimes a party must sail against the wind" [...] and in particular should provide health care as [...] "a basic right for all, not just an expensive privilege for the few." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Sgt. Pepper's was {{preceded by}} several albums that had begun to bridge the line between [...] "disposable" [...] pop and [...] "serious" [...] rock, it {{successfully}} gave an established [...] "commercial" [...] voice to an alternative youth culture and marked {{the point at which}} the LP record emerged as a creative format whose importance was equal to or greater than that of the <b>single.</b> <b>Bill</b> Bruford, a veteran of several progressive rock bands, said that Sgt. Pepper's transformed both musicians' ideas of what was possible and audiences' ideas of what was acceptable in music. He believed that: [...] "Without the Beatles, or someone else who had done what the Beatles did, it is fair to assume that there would have been no progressive rock." [...] In the aftermath of Sgt. Pepper, magazines such as Melody Maker drew a sharp line between [...] "pop" [...] and [...] "rock', thus eliminating the [...] "roll" [...] from [...] "rock and roll" [...] (which now refers to the 1950s style). The only artists who remained [...] "rock" [...] would be those who were considered at the vanguard of compositional forms, far from [...] "radio friendly" [...] standards, as Americans increasingly used the adjective [...] "progressive" [...] for groups like Jethro Tull, Family, East of Eden, Van Der Graaf Generator, and King Crimson.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} motivations have been {{suggested}} to explain why mobile telecoms providers use convergent charging & billing. One {{is the ability to}} offer mobile service packages that include both pre- and post-paid services.

500|$|In {{the fourth}} debate, on October 23 at Monrovia High School, Nixon {{attacked}} Voorhis' congressional record. The challenger alleged {{that in the}} previous four years, Voorhis only {{had been able to}} pass a <b>single</b> <b>bill</b> through Congress and into law. [...] The bill in question transferred jurisdiction over rabbit farming from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture. [...] Nixon chided, [...] "One has to be a rabbit to get effective representation in this congressional district." [...] Voorhis responded that he had sponsored an act to employ the physically handicapped, but Nixon stated {{that it was not a}} law, but a joint resolution. [...] Nixon restated his allegation regarding Voorhis and the PAC; Voorhis retorted that he had repudiated the NCPAC endorsement. Nixon parried with a comment that Voorhis's voting record [...] "earned him the endorsement, whether he wanted it or not". [...] Nixon also contended that in 46votes, Voorhis had almost entirely followed the CIO-PAC agenda. Distraught, Voorhis stayed up until 4am studying the votes Nixon had taxed him with. [...] He concluded that due to duplications, there were actually only 27roll calls in question, on many of which he had opposed the CIO-PAC position. [...] The congressman also found that the votes [...] "friendly" [...] to the CIO-PAC included one authorizing a school lunch program.|$|E

2500|$|The {{national}} publicity {{given to}} the airport's problems led to action. [...] This time, Congress adopted a different legislative strategy. [...] In late March, the Senate approved two bills (rather than a <b>single</b> <b>bill),</b> one to close Military Road and one to expand the airport by transferring {{a portion of the}} Arlington Experimental Farm to the facility. The House passed both bills in early April. President Roosevelt signed the bill closing Military Road on April 14. Washington-Hoover officials immediately announced a plan to secure an additional [...] of land and build five runways about [...] long. The airport tendered its $25,000 payment to the county in late April. Military Road closed on Monday, May 15, 1938.

However, Clay's specific proposals for achieving a compromise, including his idea for Texas's boundary, were not adopted in a <b>single</b> <b>bill.</b> Upon Clay's urging, Senator Stephen A. Douglas, Democrat of Illinois, divided Clay's bill into several smaller bills and passed each separately. When he instructed Douglas, Clay was nearly dead and unable to guide the congressional debate any further. The Compromise came to coalesce around a plan dividing Texas at its present-day boundaries, creating territorial governments with [...] "popular sovereignty", without the Wilmot Proviso, for New Mexico and Utah, admitting California as a free state, abolishing the slave trade in the District of Columbia, and enacting a new fugitive slave law.|$|E

2500|$|McDonnell {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the redistricting conducted in response to the 2010 census. In a special session of the General Assembly, the redistricting of both the House of Delegates and the State Senate were passed in <b>single</b> <b>bill</b> that was approved by the House with an 86 to 8 vote and the Senate with a 22 to 18 vote. The bill was developed without regard to the advisory commission's recommendations. On April 15, 2011, McDonnell vetoed the bill on the grounds that [...] "the Senate plan is the kind of political gerrymandering that Virginians have ask that we leave in the past." [...] Although McDonnell had the power to amend the bill with his veto, he simply sent it back for the General Assembly to either over-ride the veto or adopt a different bill. Because the Democrats lacked the 2/3 majority necessary to override the veto, the State Senate had to adopt a new plan. At first, Senate Majority Leader Richard L. Saslaw promised to merely readopt the vetoed redistricting map, but then began negotiations with the governor's office about a new plan. Republican members of the House and Senate criticized the Governor for overturning the timetable for approval of new districts prior to the 2011 elections. After lengthy negotiations, on April 28, both houses passed a revised set of district maps and McDonnell announced that he would sign the revised bill.|$|E

60|$|The abiding {{feature of}} {{constitutional}} {{interest in the}} budget of 1861 was this inclusion of the various financial proposals in a <b>single</b> <b>bill,</b> so that the Lords must either accept the whole of them, or try the impossible performance of rejecting the whole of them. This was the affirmation in practical shape of {{the resolution of the}} House of Commons in the previous year, that it possessed in its own hands the power to remit and impose taxes, and that the right to frame bills of supply in its own measure, manner, time, and matter, is a right to be kept inviolable. Until now the practice had been to make the different taxes the subject of as many different bills, thus placing it {{in the power of the}} Lords to reject a given tax bill without throwing the financial machinery wholly out of gear. By including all the taxes in a single finance bill the power of the Lords to override the other House was effectually arrested.|$|E
