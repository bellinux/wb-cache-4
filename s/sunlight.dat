5|$|Solar {{power is}} the {{conversion}} of <b>sunlight</b> into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP). CSP systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of <b>sunlight</b> into a small beam. PV converts light into electric current using the photoelectric effect.|$|E
5|$|When the {{shrinking}} visible {{part of the}} photosphere becomes very small, Baily's beads will occur. These are caused by the <b>sunlight</b> still being able to reach the Earth through lunar valleys. Totality then begins with the diamond ring effect, the last bright flash of <b>sunlight.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's axis is tilted {{relative}} to its orbital plane, <b>sunlight</b> is incident at different angles {{at different times}} of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude <b>sunlight</b> falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} {{framework}} based on integral geometry {{that makes it}} possible to express and solve most geometrical <b>sunlighting</b> problems within CAD systems: the direct problems for assessing <b>sunlighting</b> in a scene and the inverse ones for achieving <b>sunlighting</b> constraints in a design context. The heart of our method is the <b>sunlighting</b> volume that we denote ?(P, T). We describe this notion and we show how to implement it in an architectural and urban design process...|$|R

5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate <b>sunlight</b> onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} same amount of space, allowing more of the available <b>sunlight</b> to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.|$|E
5|$|DST has mixed {{effects on}} health. In {{societies}} with fixed work schedules it provides more afternoon <b>sunlight</b> for outdoor exercise. It alters <b>sunlight</b> exposure; {{whether this is}} beneficial depends on one's location and daily schedule, as <b>sunlight</b> triggers vitamin D synthesis in the skin, but overexposure can lead to skin cancer. DST may help in depression by causing individuals to rise earlier, but some argue the reverse. The Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness, chaired by blind sports magnate Gordon Gund, successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for U.S. DST extensions. DST shifts are associated with higher rates of ischemic stroke {{in the first two}} days after the shift, though not in the week thereafter.|$|E
5|$|During {{sunrise and}} sunset, <b>sunlight</b> is {{attenuated}} because of Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through Earth's atmosphere, and the Sun is sometimes faint {{enough to be}} viewed comfortably {{with the naked eye}} or safely with optics (provided there is no risk of bright <b>sunlight</b> suddenly appearing through a break between clouds). Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this atmospheric attenuation.|$|E

5|$|Grit {{is often}} mixed with hydrous sodium {{ferrocyanide}} as an anticaking agent which, while harmless {{in its natural}} form, can undergo photodissociation in strong <b>sunlight</b> to produce the extremely toxic chemical hydrogen cyanide. Although <b>sunlight</b> is generally not intense enough to cause this in polar and temperate regions, salt deposits must kept {{as far as possible}} from waterways to avert the possibility of cyanide-tainted runoff water entering fisheries or farms.|$|E
5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by <b>sunlight,</b> that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed <b>sunlight</b> falling onto the Moon, and that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed <b>sunlight</b> from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E

5|$|Rushes, tussock sedge, cattails, jewelweed, sphagnum, {{and various}} native true grasses {{are found in}} the bog turtle's habitat, as well as some shrubs and trees such as willows, red maples, and alders. It is {{important}} for their habitat to have an open canopy, because bog turtles spend a considerable amount of time basking in the <b>sunlight.</b> An open canopy allows sufficient <b>sunlight</b> to reach the ground so that the bog turtles can manage their metabolic processes through thermoregulation. The incubation of eggs also requires levels of <b>sunlight</b> and humidity that shaded areas typically lack. The ideal bog turtle habitat is early successional. Late successional habitats contain taller trees that block the necessary <b>sunlight.</b> Erosion and runoff of nutrients into the wetlands accelerate succession. Changes caused by humans have begun to eliminate bog turtles from areas where they would normally survive.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{power is}} the {{conversion}} of energy from <b>sunlight</b> into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of <b>sunlight</b> into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{energy in}} <b>sunlight</b> is {{captured}} by plants, cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, green sulfur bacteria and some protists. This process is often coupled to {{the conversion of}} carbon dioxide into organic compounds, as part of photosynthesis, which is discussed below. The energy capture and carbon fixation systems can however operate separately in prokaryotes, as purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can use <b>sunlight</b> {{as a source of}} energy, while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation of organic compounds.|$|E

5|$|The ocean can be {{conceptualized}} as being divided into various zones, depending on depth, and {{presence or absence}} of <b>sunlight.</b> Nearly all life forms in the ocean depend on the photosynthetic activities of phytoplankton and other marine plants to convert carbon dioxide into organic carbon, which is the basic building block of organic matter. Photosynthesis in turn requires energy from <b>sunlight</b> to drive the chemical reactions that produce organic carbon.|$|E
5|$|The southwestern United States {{is one of}} the world's best {{areas for}} insolation, and the Mojave Desert {{receives}} up to twice the <b>sunlight</b> received in other regions of the country. This abundance of solar energy makes solar power plants a cleaner alternative to traditional power plants, which burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Solar power stations provide an environmentally benign source of energy, produce virtually no emissions, and consume no fuel other than <b>sunlight.</b> Some groups are also encouraging more distributed generation, or rooftop solar.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} find out the lighting length of the combination LED and fluorescent lamps combined,suitable to growpakcoy (Brassica rapa L.) withwick systemhydroponics. The research used five treatments: <b>sunlighting</b> as a control (P 0), and artificial lighting of 36 -watt LED combined with 42 -watt fluorescent lamps. <b>Sunlighting</b> represented a conventional cultivation, with normal lighting period (± 12 hours per day), while theartificial lighting consisted of four different lighting lengths per day: 8 hours (P 1), 12 hours (P 2), 16 hours (P 3) and 20 hours (P 4). The artificial lighting experiments were placed in boxes as the growth chambers, while theregular <b>sunlighting</b> treatmentwas placed inan outdoorminigreenhouse. Each treatment consisted of four plants,so there were 20 plants in total. The results showed that 20 -hour treatment of 36 -watt LED lamp plus 42 -wattfluorescent lighting (P 4) was the best among the other artificial lighting treatments, but still less optimal ascompared to the treatment of natural sun lighting (P 0). The plants grew in treatmentP 4 still showed etiolating,indicating possibility of using higher power than 36 -watt LED lamp and 42 -watt fluorescent, although the lengthof lighting reached 20 hours. Yet, in termof quality, the mineral/ash content of all treated plants was notmuchdifferent...|$|R
