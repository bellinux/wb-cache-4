5|$|According to the {{prevailing}} classification scheme by Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the first division occurred around 2200 BCE, when Huastecan split away from Mayan proper after its speakers moved northwest along the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Proto-Yucatecan and Proto-Ch'olan speakers subsequently split off from the main group and moved north into the Yucatán Peninsula. <b>Speakers</b> <b>of</b> the western branch moved south into the areas now inhabited by Mamean and Quichean people. When <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> proto-Tzeltalan later separated from the Ch'olan group and moved south into the Chiapas highlands, they {{came into contact with}} <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> Mixe–Zoque languages. According to an alternative theory by Robertson and Houston, Huastecan stayed in the Guatemalan highlands with <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> Ch'olan-Tzeltalan, separating from that branch at a much later date than proposed by Kaufman.|$|E
5|$|Four major Chinese-speech {{groups are}} {{represented}} in Indonesia: Hokkien, Mandarin, Hakka and Cantonese. In addition to these, the Teochew people speak their own dialect that has some degree of mutual intelligibility with Hokkien. Distinctions between the two, however, are accentuated outside of their regions of origin. There were an estimated 2.2 million native <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> various Chinese varieties in Indonesia in 1982: 1,300,000 <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> Southern Min varieties (including Hokkien and Teochew); 640,000 Hakka speakers; 460,000 Mandarin speakers; 180,000 Cantonese speakers; and 20,000 <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> the Eastern Min varieties (including Fuzhou dialect).

Varieties of English learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners. Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> English in the inner-circle countries, and they may have grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well.

5|$|Hergé's Arumbaya fetish {{was based}} on the design of a genuine Peruvian statue in Brussels' Royal Museums of Art and History; a pre-Columbian Chimu statue, it was made of wood and dated to between 1200 and 1438 CE. Whereas Hergé had access to <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> Mandarin when {{creating}} The Blue Lotus, he had no access to <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> indigenous Amerindian languages, and as such, the Arumbaya language that he developed was entirely fictitious. He based its structure largely on the Brusselier dialect spoken in the Marolles area of Brussels, mixed with Spanish endings and constructions. In developing the Arumbaya's rivals, the Bibaros, he was influenced by anthropological accounts of head shrinking among the Jibaros tribes; when Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner translated the book into English, they renamed the Bibaros as the Rumbabas, a pun on the rum baba pudding.|$|E
