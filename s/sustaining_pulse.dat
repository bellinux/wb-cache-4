40|$|Abstract Background The tumor {{suppressor}} p 53 plays pivotal {{roles in}} tumorigenesis suppression. Although oscillations of p 53 have been extensively studied, {{the mechanism of}} p 53 pulses and their physiological roles in DNA damage response remain unclear. Results To address these questions we presented an integrated model in which Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) activation and p 53 oscillation were incorporated with downstream apoptotic events, particularly the interplays between Bcl- 2 family proteins. We first reproduced digital oscillation of p 53 as the response of normal cells to DNA damage. Subsequent modeling in mutant cells showed that high basal DNA damage is a plausible cause for <b>sustained</b> p 53 <b>pulses</b> observed in tumor cells. Further computational analyses indicated that p 53 -dependent PUMA accumulation and the PUMA-controlled Bax activation switch might play pivotal roles to count p 53 pulses and thus decide the cell fate. Conclusion The high levels of basal DNA damage are responsible for generating <b>sustained</b> <b>pulses</b> of p 53 in the tumor cells. Meanwhile, the Bax activation switch can count p 53 pulses through PUMA accumulation and transfer it into death signal. Our modeling provides a plausible mechanism about how cells generate and orchestrate p 53 pulses to tip the balance between survival and death. </p...|$|R

We seek regions in parameter space where the laser exhibits pulses with zero jitter, and show that unlike in the ODE case, where regions of self-pulsation are lim-ited, adding feedback to the system drastically increases areas where the laser exhibits pulse-like behaviour.

40|$|Single cell {{experiments}} {{of simple}} regulatory networks can markedly differ from cell population experiments. Such differences arise from stochastic events in individual {{cells that are}} averaged out in cell populations. For instance, while individual cells may show sustained oscillations in the concentrations of some proteins, such oscillations may appear damped in the population average. In this paper we investigate the role of RNA stochastic fluctuations as a leading force to produce a sustained excitatory behavior at the single cell level. Opposed to some previous models, we build a fully stochastic model of a negative feedback loop that explicitly {{takes into account the}} RNA stochastic dynamics. We find that messenger RNA random fluctuations can be amplified during translation and produce <b>sustained</b> <b>pulses</b> of protein expression.

40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} p 53 protein shows various dynamic responses {{depending on}} the types and extent of cellular stresses. In particular, in response to DNA damage induced by c-irradiation, cells generate a series of p 53 pulses. Recent research has shown the importance of sustaining repeated p 53 pulses for recovery from DNA damage. However, far too {{little attention has been}} paid to understanding how cells can <b>sustain</b> p 53 <b>pulses</b> given the complexities of genetic heterogeneity and intrinsic noise. Here, we explore potential molecular mechanisms that enhance the sustainability of p 53 pulses by developing a new mathematical model of the p 53 regulatory system. This model can reproduce many experimental results that describe the dynamics of p 53 pulses. By simulating the model both deterministically and stochastically, we found three potential mechanisms that improve the sustainability of p 53 pulses: 1) the recently identified positive feedback loop between p 53 and Rora allows cells to <b>sustain</b> p 53 <b>pulses</b> with high amplitude over a wide range of conditions, 2) intrinsic noise can often prevent the dampening of p 53 pulses even after mutations, and 3) coupling of p 53 pulses in neighboring cells via cytochrome-c significantly reduces the chance of failure in <b>sustaining</b> p 53 <b>pulses</b> in the presence of heterogeneity among cells.

Carlylism is the male of Byronism. It is Byronism with thew and sinew, bass pipe and shaggy bosom. There is the same grievous complaint against the time and its men and its spirit, something even of the same contemptuous despair, the same sense of the puniness of man in the centre of a cruel and frowning universe; but there is in Carlylism a deliverance from it all, indeed the only deliverance possible. Its despair is a despair without misery. Labour in a high spirit, duty done, and right service performed in fortitudinous temper--here was, not indeed a way out, but a way of erect living within.|$|R

40|$|Tropical peatlands {{are high}} carbon density {{ecosystems}} {{that are currently}} extremely vulnerable to destabilisation through human and climate induced changes. They contain 89 Gt carbon (3 % global soil carbon) but rapid land use changes (deforestation, drainage) and consequent fire are rapidly releasing this. There are approximately 27. 1 million hectares (Mha) (an area approximately equivalent in size to the UK) of peatland in Southeast Asia which accounts for around 56 % of all tropical peatlands worldwide. 20. 7 Mha (83 %) is found in Indonesia, primarily in Eastern Sumatra and Central Kalimantan. The dry season of 2009 (May-October) proved {{to be one of}} the most intense Bornean fire events since 1997. We sought to establish how fluvial carbon dynamics in tropical peat rich catchments were affected in the period following these catastrophic fires. Fluvial carbon fluxes were quantified from 8 channels draining peat swamp forest (PSF) catchments in Central Kalimantan, Borneo from weekly measurements over a 6 -month period immediately following the end of the fire period. These included 5 channels draining degraded PSF catchments that were subject to fires during the dry season of 2009 and 3 channels draining intact PSF that was unaffected by the fires. Cumulative total organic carbon (TOC) fluxes for the duration of the study were 32 to 68 % larger in the catchment channels that had been affected by fire, when compared to fluxes during the same interval in the previous year (which was unexceptional in terms of fire). This is in marked contrast to channels draining the intact (no fire) forest where there were no differences observed in fluxes. Concentration data demonstrates that there was an initial decrease in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and an increase in particulate organic carbon (POC) immediately following the onset of the first rains which continued for ~ 1 month until reaching similar levels to the corresponding period in the previous year. For DOC fluxes (the largest fraction) this decrease in concentration was more than offset by a large increase in fluvial discharge (from decreased transpiration and increased runoff through denuded vegetation cover) which contributed an overall net increase in flux. The fire-stimulated increase in fluvial carbon flux is set against a pattern of higher fluxes in the degraded catchments established during the pre-fire year where oxidation of the peat column results in high losses. Our data are the first to demonstrate a large and <b>sustained</b> <b>pulse</b> of fluvial carbon following large scale fires in carbon rich tropical PSF.

In the proposed model, intranuclear reactions were modeled as stochastic processes and cytoplasmic reactions as deterministic processes, and both reaction sets were simulated simultaneously. The simulated results at the single-cell level showed that the model generated several <b>sustained</b> oscillations (<b>pulses)</b> of p 53, Mdm 2, ATM, and Wip 1, and cell-to-cell variability {{in the number of}} p 53 pulses depended on IR intensity.

40|$|Few {{previous}} studies have examined fine-grained variation {{in the structure of}} alarm calls, as distinct from differences between call types, and most of these have focused on information content (eg level of predation threat). We focused on the design of aerial alarm calls in male fowl, Gallus gallus, with the goal of explaining observed changes in call structure during encounters with simulated predators. These calls typically begin with one or more shot pulsatile elements, which are followed by a sustained element consisting of one or more units. We analysed bouts of aerial alarm calling from 30 individual roosters, measuring duration, dominant frequency and frequency bandwidth (- 10 dB), for all <b>pulse</b> and <b>sustained</b> elements. <b>Pulse</b> duration was significantly reduced between first, second and third calls in a bout. This change was highly selective. Both mulivariate analyses of other features and spectrogram cross-correlation reveal that pulse reduction was not accompanied by other variation in structure. Recent studies have shown that raptors can detect the aerial alarm calls of G. gallus, but that they cannot easily locate the source of the call. Nevertheless, the pulse element of the aerial alarm call has spectral and temporal characteristics known to be readily localisable by raptors, and hence costly. By reducing the duration of the pulse, the caller likely reduces his conspicuousness and thus manages predation risk. We suggest a possible functional benefit to account for the inclusion of a high-risk element in aerial alarm calls. 1 page(s...|$|R

The concept of a turning point is established, which indicates the point in time where the mitigation of a short-term effect (e. g. line-shaped contrails) at the expense of a counteracting long-term effect (e. g. carbon dioxide) becomes preferable. In our generic situation, some physical metrics (e. g. average metrics, physical cost-benefit metrics) are better suited than others to trade off short- and long-lived climate effects for obtaining a robust policy recommendation.

After <b>pulse</b> administration of PAF, the first phase lasts {{for a few seconds}} and reaches a peak value of 0. 5 – 1 μM Ca 2 + at high PAF concentration. The amplitude of this peak is independent of extracellular Ca+ concentration, suggesting that the initial Ca 2 + transient is due to the release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores. The second phase of the response lasts for several minutes; its maximum amplitude is reached 1 – 2 min after the brief initial PAF stimulation. This phase, suppressed in zero external Ca 2 + and increased in 10 mM Ca 2 +, is probably due to influx of Ca 2 + through the plasma membrane. This secondary Ca 2 + increase is blocked by 10 – 50 μM lanthanum. At low PAF concentration, the initial Ca 2 + transient is not followed by a second phase, showing that the initial rises of Ca 2 + and of its activator (presumably inositol trisphosphate) are not sufficient to trigger the second phase of Ca 2 + increase...|$|R

In this way, bursts of pulses could be delivered in synch with the pendulum period in order to build up any motion. However, when using a laser beam passing through a lens attached to the antenna to amplify linear displacement by a factor of at least 25, no correlated motion of the beam spot could be detected on a distant wall. We conclude, in agreement with the momentum theorem of classical electromagnetic theory, that any thrust produced is far below practically useful levels. Hence, within classical electrodynamics, there is little hope of detecting any low level motion that cannot be explained by interactions with surrounding structural steel and the Earth's magnetic field...|$|R
40|$|Temporal-dissipative Kerr solitons are self-localized light <b>pulses</b> <b>sustained</b> in driven {{nonlinear}} optical resonators. Their realization in microresonators {{has enabled}} compact sources of coherent optical frequency combs {{as well as}} the study of dissipative solitons. A key parameter of their dynamics is the effective-detuning of the pump laser to the thermally- and Kerr-shifted cavity resonance. Together with the free spectral range and dispersion, it governs the soliton-pulse duration, as predicted by an approximate analytical solution of the Lugiato-Lefever equation. Yet, a precise experimental verification of this relation was lacking so far. Here, by measuring and controlling the effective-detuning, we establish a new way of stabilizing solitons in microresonators and demonstrate that the measured relation linking soliton width and detuning deviates by less than 1 % from the approximate expression, validating its excellent predictive power. Furthermore, a detuning-dependent enhancement of specific comb lines is revealed, due to linear couplings between mode-families. They cause deviations from the predicted comb power evolution, and induce a detuning-dependent soliton recoil that modifies the pulse repetition-rate, explaining its unexpected dependence on laser-detuning. Finally, we observe that detuning-dependent mode-crossings can destabilize the soliton, leading to an unpredicted soliton breathing regime (oscillations of the pulse) that occurs in a normally-stable regime. Our results test the approximate analytical solutions with an unprecedented degree of accuracy and provide new insights into dissipative-soliton dynamics. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothalamic}} neuropeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is secreted in a pulsatile fashion by hypothalamic neurons, and {{alterations in}} pulse frequency and amplitude differentially regulate gonadotropin synthesis and release. In this study, we investigated the kinetics of Gs and Gq signaling {{in response to}} continuous or pulsatile GnRH using fluorescence resonance energy transfer reporters in live mouse LβT 2 gonadotrope cells. cAMP and protein kinase A-dependent reporters showed a rapid but transient increase in fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal with increasing doses of constant GnRH, and in contrast diacylglycerol (DAG) and calcium reporters showed a rapid and <b>sustained</b> signal. Multiple <b>pulses</b> of GnRH caused multiple pulses of cAMP and protein kinase A activation without desensitization, but the DAG and calcium reporters were rapidly desensitized resulting in inhibition of calcium and DAG responses. At the transcriptional level, both a cAMP-dependent cAMP-response element reporter and a DAG/calcium-dependent AP- 1 reporter showed a pulse frequency-dependent increase in luciferase activity. However, constant GnRH stimulation gave very little cAMP-response element activation but very strong AP- 1 activation. Based on these data, we propose that both the GnRH-R-Gs and Gq pathways are responsive to pulses of GnRH, but only the Gq pathway is responsive to constant GnRH. Furthermore, the Gq pathway is subject to desensitization with multiple GnRH pulses, but the Gs pathway is not...|$|R
40|$|Cochlear {{implants}} are prosthetic {{devices that}} seek to restore hearing in profoundly deaf patients by electrically stimulating the auditory-nerve (AN). With current implants, {{the representation of the}} sound waveform in temporal discharge patterns of the auditory nerve is severely distorted. The distortion is particularly significant at higher (> 600 Hz) frequencies, for which the period of the electric stimulus is near the AN refractory period. For example, in response to a 1000 -Hz pulse train, most AN fibers may fire on every other stimulus cycle, so that the AN population would represent half of the stimulus frequency rather than the actual frequency. Rubinstein et al. [Hearing. Res. 127, 108] proposed that the coding of electric waveforms in cochlear implants can be improved if a sustained, electric high-rate (5 kpps) desynchronizing pulse train (DPT) is presented in addition to the information-carrying electric stimulus. The DPT may amplify the inherent noise in ANfibers so as to produce ongoing, stochastic discharges similar to the spontaneous activity in a healthy hear. We tested this hypothesis by recording responses of ANfibers of deafened cats to <b>sustained</b> electric <b>pulse</b> trains. For most fibers, responses to the DPT showed adaptation during the first 2 minutes, followed by a sustained response {{for the remainder of the}} 10 -minute stimulus. These sustained responses partially resembled spontaneous activity in terms of discharge rate and interspike interval distributions. AN fibers were extremely sensitive to modulations of the DPT, responding tomodulations as small as 0. 5 %. (cont.) Responses to sinusoidal modulations resembled AN responses to pure tones over a 15 - 25 dB range of modulation depths. Responses to complex modulations simultaneously represented several spectral components of the modulator in their temporal discharge patterns. However, for modulation depths above 10 %, the representation of both sinusoidal and complex modulators was more distorted. These results demonstrate that strategies that incorporate a DPT, and that use low modulation depths to encode sounds, may evoke AN responses that more accurately represent the modulator in their temporal discharge patterns. If the central nervous system can utilize this information, then these strategies may substantially improve performance enjoyed by cochlear implant users. by Leonid Litvak. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Cochlear {{implants}} (CIs) are neural prostheses {{that currently}} provide acoustic sensation {{to more than}} 120, 000 profoundly hearing-impaired people throughout the world. The majority of these CI users are able to understand speech without lip reading and to converse over the telephone. The most fortunate among them can even perform and appreciate music. Unfortunately, however, many CI recipients receive much less benefit from their devices. In order to examine the neuronal bases for these disparate outcomes, a recording system was developed to overcome specific technical limitations in previous studies that recorded neuronal responses to cochlear implant stimulation in animal models. This recording system was then used in two studies comparing responses to normal acoustic stimulation and electrical cochlear implant stimulation in guinea pigs and cats. The design of the recording system included a 32 -channel recording amplifier and a software technique for removing stimulus artifacts from recordings of neural responses to high-rate electrical stimulation. Contemporary cochlear implants often deliver current pulse trains with carrier rates of 1000 pulses/s or higher. In neurophysiology studies, this electrical stimulation produces artifacts that are typically much larger than neuronal responses. Therefore, the recording system was specifically designed to record neuronal responses and cancel these electrical stimulus artifacts. When biphasic full-scale-input pulses (1. 5 -V) are applied directly to the amplifier inputs, each recording channel settles to 20 micro-volts in less than 80 microseconds. This fast recovery makes it likely that the recording electrode-electrolyte interface, not the recording electronics, will limit artifact settling times. Artifacts are blanked in software, allowing flexibility {{in the choice of}} blanking period and the possibility of recovering neural data occurring simultaneously with non-saturating artifacts. The system has been used in-vivo to record central neuronal responses to intracochlear electrical stimulation at rates up to 2000 pulses/s. Using this recording system, systematic and quantitative comparisons of inferior-colliculus responses to acoustic stimulation and electrical stimulation in two configurations (monopolar and bipolar) were carried in guinea pigs and cats. Previous cochlear implant studies using isolated electrical stimulus pulses in animal models have reported that monopolar stimulus configurations elicit broad extents of neuronal activation within the central auditory system [...] much broader than the activation patterns produced by bipolar electrode pairs or acoustic tones. However, psychophysical and speech reception studies that use <b>sustained</b> <b>pulse</b> trains do not show clear performance differences between monopolar and bipolar configurations. To evaluate whether monopolar intracochlear stimulation can produce selective excitation of the inferior colliculus, activation widths were determined along the tonotopic axis of the inferior colliculus for acoustic tones and 1000 -pulse/s electrical pulse trains in guinea pigs and cats. Electrical pulse trains were presented using an array of 6 - 12 stimulating electrodes distributed longitudinally along a space-filling silicone carrier positioned in the scala tympani of the cochlea. The data indicated that for monopolar, bipolar, and acoustic stimuli, activation widths were significantly narrower for sustained responses than for the transient response to the stimulus onset. Furthermore, monopolar and bipolar stimuli elicited similar activation widths when compared at stimulus levels that produced similar peak spike rates. Surprisingly, monopolar and bipolar stimuli produced narrower sustained activation than 60 dB SPL acoustic tones when compared at stimulus levels that produced similar peak spike rates. Therefore, the conclusion from these experiments was that intracochlear electrical stimulation using monopolar pulse trains can produce activation patterns that are at least as selective as bipolar or acoustic stimulation, if stimulus intensities are appropriately matched. The second study compared responses to acoustic and monopolar electrical stimuli that were sinusoidally amplitude modulated (SAM), in order to better model the complex signals delivered by CI processors. For both normal hearing listeners and cochlear implant users, SAM signals produce psychophysical interactions that can extend across large differences in carrier frequency or large intracochlear electrode separations. However, the neural correlates of these phenomena are not well understood. This study was designed to determine whether SAM stimuli elicit activation across a broader extent of the frequency axis of the inferior colliculus than unmodulated steady-state stimuli, and whether this activation is strongly phase locked to the SAM stimulus envelope. To address these questions neuronal activity in the inferior colliculus of guinea pigs, normal cats and chronically deafened cats was recorded in response to acoustic and electrical stimulation. Quantitative analysis of recordings indicated that the extent of inferior colliculus activation was up to 70 % broader for SAM stimuli than for unmodulated steady-state stimuli in normal cats and guinea pigs and 160 % broader in chronically deafened cats. This activity was also phase-locked to the SAM envelope across a broad extent of the frequency axis of the inferior colliculus. These results suggest that a number of cross-carrier frequency interactions for SAM stimuli could occur {{at the level of the}} inferior colliculus. They also show that direct comparisons of responses to acoustic and electrical SAM stimuli can reveal attributes of neural processing that underlie specific psychophysical findings in CI recipients [...] and thereby can provide a powerful basis for guiding development of new processing strategies for future cochlear implants...|$|R
