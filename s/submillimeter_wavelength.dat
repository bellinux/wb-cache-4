40|$|Our {{universe}} is most luminous at far-infrared and <b>submillimeter</b> <b>wavelengths</b> (100 GHz - 10 THz) after the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.

Sensors at far-infrared and <b>submillimeter</b> <b>wavelengths</b> provide unprecedented sensitivity for astrophysical, planetary, and earth observing instruments. Very often, for a spaced based platform where the instruments are not limited by atmospheric losses and absorption, the overall instrument sensitivity is dictated by the sensitivity of the sensors themselves.

40|$|Heterodyne receivers, which down-convert radio {{frequency}} (RF) signals to intermediate frequency (IF) signals – preserving the amplitude and phase information {{of the incoming}} radiation, are generally the detector of choice for high resolution spectroscopic studies in astrophysics and planetary remote sensing. Many interesting astronomical objects, such as galaxies, molecular clouds, star-forming regions, proto-stars, and planets have rich submillimeter spectra. Much {{can be learned from}} these spectra, including the structure, dynamics, chemistry, energy balance, mass, density, and temperature of the sources. High resolution spectroscopy is very often required to avoid line blending and resolve the line shapes. Heterodyne receivers provide both the sensitivity and resolution for such studies. Moreover, heterodyne receivers at <b>submillimeter</b> <b>wavelengths</b> are increasingly being used in medical imaging and contraband detection. However, {{it is clear that the}} future instruments, specifically the space-based observatories with cold telescopes, will demand heterodyne arrays for higher sensitivity, greater mapping speed, large scale mapping ability, multiple line spectroscopy, and imaging capability. Passive and/or active heterodyne focal plane arrays would have profound impact on medical diagnostics, contraband detections, and astrophysical spectroscopy and imaging applications. However, only a handful of heterodyne array instruments at <b>submillimeter</b> <b>wavelengths</b> with a limited number of pixels are currently operational or being developed for astrophysical studies. In this paper we shall review the challenging issues in the development of heterodyne arrays with state-of-the-art detector sensitivities at <b>submillimeter</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> Such arrays ar...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{excellent}} progress in the development of millimeter and <b>submillimeter</b> <b>wavelength</b> components such as mixers and multipliers. Particularly, SIS mixers have yielded sensitivity near the quantum limit at frequencies approaching 1 THz and hot-electron bolometric mixers now promise similar performance above 1 'THz. However, for many applications the cost of building and maintaining cryogenic systems is prohibitive. In such cases, GaAs Schottky diode technology remains a very attractive option, provided the sensitivity requirement is not so great, particularly now that planar (whiskerless) diodes are yielding good performance. However, even in the case of Schottky mixers and multipliers, the cost of machining the waveguide blocks can be prohibitive, particularly at THz frequencies and/or when array applications are considered. In this paper we summarize two techniques which allow low cost manufacturing of millimeter and <b>submillimeter</b> <b>wavelength</b> components. I.

40|$|Sgr A* is {{variable}} {{at radio}} and <b>submillimeter</b> <b>wavelengths</b> on hourly timescales, showing time delays between {{the peaks of}} flare emission as well as linearly polarized emission at millimeter and <b>submillimeter</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> To determine the polarization characteristics of this variable source at radio frequencies, we present VLA observations of Sgr A* and report the detection of polarized emission {{at a level of}} 0. 77 % ± 0. 01 % and 0. 2 % ± 0. 01 % at 43 and 22 GHz, respectively. The change in the time-averaged polarization angle between 22 and 43 GHz corresponds to a RM of (− 2. 5 ± 0. 6) × 10 ³ rad m- 2 with no phase wrapping (or ~ 5 × 10 ⁴ rad m² with 2 π phase wrap). We also note a rise and fall timescale of 1. 5 – 2 hr in the total polarized intensity. The light curves of the degree of linearly polarized emission suggest a correlation with the variability of the total intensity at 43 GHz. The available polarization data at radio and <b>submillimeter</b> <b>wavelengths</b> suggest that the rotation measure decreases with decreasing frequency. This frequency dependence, and observed changes in polarization angle during flare events, may be caused by the reduction in rotation measure associated with the expansion of synchrotron-emitting blobs. 4 page(s...|$|R

Using ISOCAM, IRAS, ISOPHOT and SCUBA data with the Désert et al (1990) model, we find consistency with little contribution from PAHs and Very Small Grains and a relative abundance of bigger colder grains, which dominate the FIR and <b>submillimeter</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> We are compelled to use 4 dust components, adding a very cold dust component, to reproduce the submillimetre excess of our observations. ...|$|R
