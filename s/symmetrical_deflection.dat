40|$|A {{feasibility}} study {{to assess the}} benefits/penalties of installing tip-fin controllers on the Space Shuttle orbiter has been conducted. The results from the aerodynamic and stability and control assessment {{of this study are}} presented. These results show that using tip-fin controllers with the centerline vertical tail removed provides adequate control for entry. The orbiter basic maneuvering capability is maintained, and <b>symmetrical</b> <b>deflection</b> of the controllers provides adequate speedbrake authority for energy management. Gust analyses of the orbiter with the tip-fin controller configuration have demonstrated no compromise of existing cross-wind landing capability. Six-degree-of-freedom simulations have shown the tip-fin controllers can provide adequate control for entry with no degradation in vehicle capability...|$|E
40|$|A {{deflectable}} strake {{concept was}} investigated on a conical forebody to evaluate its yaw control potential at high angles of attack. In exploratory low-speed tunnel tests using a generic delta wing fighter configuration, antisymmetrically deflected strakes provided useful levels of yaw power at angles of attack when the conventional rudder became totally degraded. Symmetrical strakes prevented side force development at high angles of attack, and provided pitch control through <b>symmetrical</b> <b>deflection.</b> The strake performance was sensitive to its circumferential {{position on the}} forebody due to varying interaction of strake vortices with the wing and vertical tail. The low Reynolds number {{results of this study}} provided a favorable initial validation of the concept, subject to verification in regard to scale effects...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Langley 8 foot transonic pressure tunnel {{to determine the effects}} of differential and <b>symmetrical</b> aileron <b>deflection</b> on the longitudinal and lateral directional aerodynamic characteristics of an 0. 087 scale model of an NASA supercritical wing research airplane (TF- 8 A). Tests were conducted at Mach numbers from 0. 25 to 0. 99 in order {{to determine the effects of}} differential aileron deflection and at Mach numbers of 0. 25 and 0. 50 to determine the effects of <b>symmetrical</b> aileron (flap) <b>deflection.</b> The angle of attack range for all tests varied from approximately - 12 deg to 20 deg...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The serial {{reaction}} time (SRT) task {{is a simple}} procedure in which participants produce differentiated responses to each {{of a series of}} stimuli presented at varying locations. Learning about stimulus order is revealed through decreased latencies for structured versus randomized sequences. Although widely used with humans and well suited to nonhumans, this paradigm is little used in comparative research. In the present article, we describe an SRT procedure that uses colored circles as stimuli, a circular layout of locations, and <b>symmetrical</b> joystick <b>deflections</b> as responses. In two experiments, we showed that four rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) learned to track sequences up to eight items long, with three animals showing faster responding to repeating sequences than to randomized versions. After extended training, these participants also showed evidence of faster responding at all positions within repeating sequences. This method minimizes response effort, equates effort and travel distance across stimulus locations, and is applicable to any joystick-capable species...|$|R
40|$|Several {{approximate}} {{procedures for}} calculating the bending-moment response of flexible airplanes to continuous isotropic turbulence are presented and evaluated. The modal methods (the mode-displacement and force-summation methods) and a matrix method (segmented-wing method) are considered. These approximate procedures {{are applied to}} a simplified airplane for which an exact solution to the equation of motion can be obtained. The simplified airplane consists of a uniform beam with a concentrated fuselage mass at the center. Airplane motions are limited to vertical rigid-body translation and <b>symmetrical</b> wing bending <b>deflections.</b> Output power spectra of wing bending moments based on the exact transfer-function solutions are used {{as a basis for}} the evaluation of the approximate methods. It is shown that the force-summation and the matrix methods give satisfactory accuracy and that the mode-displacement method gives unsatisfactory accuracy...|$|R
