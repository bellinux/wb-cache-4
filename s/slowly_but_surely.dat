5|$|For 6 July, Charles {{planned a}} double-envelopment {{that would require}} a quick march from the forces of his brother John, then a few {{kilometres}} {{to the east of}} the battlefield. Napoleon's plan envisaged an envelopment of the Austrian left with Davout's III Corps {{while the rest of the}} army pinned the Austrian forces. Klenau's VI Corps, supported by Kollowrat's III, opened the fighting in the second day at 4am with a crushing assault against the French left, forcing the latter to abandon both Aspern and Essling. Meanwhile, a shocking development had occurred overnight. Bernadotte had unilaterally ordered his troops out of the key and central village of Aderklaa, citing heavy artillery shelling, an act that seriously compromised the entire French position. Napoleon was livid and sent two divisions of Massena's corps supported by some cavalry to regain the critical village. After difficult fighting in the first phase, Massena sent in Molitor's reserve division, which <b>slowly</b> <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> grabbed all of Aderklaa back for the French, only to lose it again following fierce Austrian bombardments and counterattacks. To buy time for Davout's materialising assault, Napoleon sent 4,000 cuirassiers under Nansouty against the Austrian lines, but their efforts led to nothing. To secure his center and his left, Napoleon formed a massive artillery battery of 112 guns that began pounding at the Austrians and tearing gaping holes through their lines. As Davout's men were progressing against the Austrian left, Napoleon formed the three small divisions of MacDonald into a hollow, oblong shape that marched against the Austrian center. The lumbering phalanx was devastated by Austrian artillery but managed to break through the center, although the victory could not be exploited because there was no cavalry in the immediate area. Nevertheless, when Charles sized up the situation, he realised it was only a matter of time before the Austrian position broke completely and ordered a retreat toward Bohemia a few hours after noon. His brother John arrived on the battlefield at 4pm, too late to have any impact, and accordingly ordered a retreat to Bohemia as well.|$|E

The galleys were dominated, and the shallow caravels positioned themselves between the ships and the coast, cutting down any who attempted to swim ashore.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} of the LRV led their purchasers quickly looking for replacements and supplements to their fleet. After the MBTA terminated their contract with Boeing-Vertol, they were free {{to make their own}} modifications to the cars. Several systems were upgraded or improved. <b>Slowly</b> <b>but</b> <b>surely,</b> cannibalized cars were brought into the MBTA shops to be prepped for service.|$|E

60|$|The bottle {{started from}} {{that part of}} the South Pacific which is known to mariners as the Desolate Region--so called from the {{circumstance}} of {{that part of the}} sea being almost entirely destitute of animal life. Here it floated <b>slowly,</b> calmly, <b>but</b> <b>surely,</b> to the eastward with the great oceanic current, which, flowing from the regions of the antarctic sea, in that part sweeps round the southern continent of America, and makes for the equator by way of the southern Atlantic Ocean.|$|R
25|$|Amidst {{growing concern}} of further {{obstruction}} by the TNI, 2 RAR continued to conduct {{operations in the}} western border areas as <b>slowly</b> <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> security was restored to East Timor.

25|$|Alekseyev's {{projects}} unbalanced {{the city}} budget, which operated at a significant deficit throughout the 1880s. He responded with investments into revenue-generating municipal enterprises. 1888, {{the year when}} the new central slaughterhouse became operational, is considered a breakthrough year: the city acquired its first large profitable asset. Income from city enterprises grew <b>slowly</b> <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> and by 1913 accounted for 55% of the city revenue.|$|E
25|$|The Spartans of Michigan State {{continued}} {{on to the}} Regional Finals by outplaying Duke {{in the second half}} and breaking a 32-32 halftime tie. Michigan State came out in the second half and secured the momentum in <b>slowly,</b> <b>but</b> <b>surely,</b> pulling away from Duke. The Spartans got out to a nine-point lead, allowed Duke to get within two, but then, scoring their last ten points of the game on free throws, moved on to the Regional Finals.|$|E

Wars are decided by great battles, and {{if these are}} lost a castle does but bring ruin upon its possessor, for it must sooner or later be taken. The man who, when a cause is lost, returns quietly to his home and goes about his usual work may escape unnoticed, while one who shuts himself up in a castle is certain to suffer at last from the vengeance of the conquerors. Resistance {{maintained}} in forests and swamps, as {{was done by the}} Bretons and Welsh, may weary out a foe, but a conqueror can wish for nothing better than that the defeated may assemble themselves in towns and castles, where he can <b>slowly,</b> perhaps, <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> destroy them piecemeal." ...|$|R
60|$|As to poor Mrs. Heatherstone, neither medical {{attention}} nor change of air can {{ever have a}} permanent effect upon her. <b>Slowly</b> and <b>surely,</b> <b>but</b> very placidly, she has declined in health and strength, until {{it is evident that}} in a very few weeks at the most she will have rejoined her husband and restored to him the one thing which he must have grudged to leave behind.|$|R

[...] "You may perceive that they have dragged the outer end of the bridge up to windward, and have just shoved it from the rocks, with the intention to permit it to drift round, until it shall bring up against the bows of the ship, when they will pour on board like so many tigers. It is a disjointed and loose contrivance, that the least sea would derange; but in this perfectly smooth water it will answer their purpose. It moves <b>slowly,</b> <b>but</b> will <b>surely</b> drift round upon us in the course of fifteen or twenty minutes more; and of this they appear to be quite certain themselves, for they seem as well satisfied with their work as if already assured of its complete success." ...|$|R
25|$|Day 4 saw a {{much more}} {{determined}} approach from the South Africans, aided by a very flat wicket offering little to the bowlers. Smith and McKenzie batted slowly and cautiously, particularly during the morning where the scoring rate was around 1 run per over. <b>Slowly,</b> <b>but</b> <b>surely,</b> they built a partnership and started to chip away at England's lead, whilst frustrating the bowlers in the process. Both men would record a century, and the only wicket to fall in the day was Smith who top edged a pull shot from the new ball off James Anderson's bowling shortly after reaching his 100.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay {{included}} the official {{rights for the}} Russian Empire to encourage settling of Armenians from Iran in the newly conquered Russian territories. This also helped in changing {{the demographics of the}} regions considerably. The Treaty of Adrianople, concluded with Turkey in 1829 granted for more mass settling of Armenians in the newly incorporated territories. <b>Slowly</b> <b>but</b> <b>surely,</b> the number of Christians, that formerly made out since the 17th century a relatively small minority in the region (except for Georgia), were starting to compose an ever-growing number of the total population, especially in the former Iranian-ruled Armenian and Georgian territories.|$|E
25|$|Isaac {{failed to}} take {{advantage}} of the chaos of the Crusaders army. As it marched across the Anatolian peninsula, it encountered frequent Turkish raids, despite official gestures of friendship from the Sultanate of Rûm under Kilij Arslan II. Not bearing to stand by and do nothing, Frederick sacked Iconium, capital of the Sultanate, before moving on. Isaac did not seize the initiative and Kilij Arslan II returned later to reclaim his fallen capital. Frederick's army would later <b>slowly</b> <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> disband after the Holy Roman Emperor was found dead (presumed to have either drowned in a river, suffered a heart attack or perhaps both). More looting and damage would be done by these weary soldiers as they retreated back to Europe.|$|E
40|$|The Semantic Web is {{developing}} <b>slowly,</b> <b>but</b> arguably <b>surely.</b> Two inter-related sources of delay are network effects and ontologies. The Semantic Web has come {{over time to}} rely on formal ontologies {{but there are many}} of these and they are each hard to master. The ability to link databases is compromised by the use of incompatible ontologies. But the RDF triplet format at the centre of the Semantic Web insists only on triplets of the form (object) (predicate or property) (subject). This paper explores the potential for a classification system that contains these three types of hierarchies (things, predicates, properties), plus a minimal set of rules on how they can be combined, to serve the needs of the Semantic Web. To this end, it surveys the roles (both the intended roles and side-effects) that formal ontologies play within the Semantic Web. The paper also briefly reviews the challenges faced in applying existing classification systems or thesauri to the Semantic Web...|$|R
6000|$|And now, {{ladies and}} gentlemen, take from hence a lesson. I have brought you {{a long and}} a strange road. Starting from this {{seemingly}} uninteresting pit, we have come upon the records of three older worlds, and on hints of worlds far older yet. We have come to them by no theories, no dreams of the fancy, but by plain honest reasoning, from plain honest facts. That wonderful things had happened, we could see: but why they had happened, we saw not. When we began to ask the reason of this thing or of that, remember how we had to stop, and laying our hands upon our mouths, only say with the Mussulman: [...] "God is great." [...] We pick our steps, by lanthorn light indeed, and <b>slowly,</b> <b>but</b> still <b>surely</b> and safely, along a dark and difficult road: but just as {{we are beginning to}} pride ourselves on having found our way so cleverly, we come to an edge of darkness; and see before our feet a bottomless abyss, down which our feeble lanthorn will not throw its light a yard.|$|R
6000|$|Not that Mollwitz kindled Europe; Europe {{was already}} kindled for some two years past;--especially {{since the late}} Kaiser died, and his Pragmatic Sanction was superadded to the other {{troubles}} afoot. But ever since that Image of JENKINS'S EAR had at last blazed up in the slow English brain, like a fiery constellation or Sign in the Heavens, symbolic of such injustices and unendurabilities, and had lighted the Spanish-English War, Europe was <b>slowly</b> <b>but</b> pretty <b>surely</b> taking fire. France [...] "could not see Spain humbled," [...] she said: England (in its own dim feeling, {{and also in the}} fact of things) could not do at all without considerably humbling Spain. France, endlessly interested in that Spanish-English matter, was already sending out fleets, firing shots,--almost, or altogether, putting forth her hand in it. [...] "In which case, will not, must not, Austria help us?" [...] thought England,--and was asking, daily, at Vienna (with intense earnestness, but without the least result), through Excellency Robinson there, when the late Kaiser died. Died, poor gentleman;--and left his big Austrian Heritages lying, as it were, in the open market-place; elaborately tied by diplomatic packthread and Pragmatic Sanction; but not otherwise protected against the assembled cupidities of mankind! Independently of Mollwitz, or of Silesia altogether, it was next to impossible that Europe could long avoid blazing out; especially unless the Spanish-English quarrel got quenched, of which there was no likelihood.|$|R
25|$|Rijkaard's {{coaching}} {{career began}} when he was appointed manager of the Netherlands national team in 1998. He had previously served as an assistant coach, along with Johan Neeskens and Ronald Koeman under the managerial tenure of Guus Hiddink. At the time, he was not taken seriously as a manager because of his inexperience, but {{he was able to}} guide his national side to the semi-finals of Euro 2000. During the group phase, the Dutch team won <b>slowly</b> <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> and managed to get three victories: 1–0 against the Czech Republic, 3–0 against Denmark and 3–2 against France. In the quarter-final, his side produced the biggest win of the competition, a 6–1 result against Yugoslavia. The Netherlands played some of the best football of the tournament, but lost their semi-final match to Italy on penalties; Rijkaard resigned immediately.|$|E
25|$|After {{the defeat}} of Napoleon Bonaparte at the 1815 Battle of Waterloo in Waterloo, Brabant, {{sovereignty}} over the Austrian Netherlands – Belgium minus the East Cantons and Luxembourg – was given by the Congress of Vienna (1815) to the United Netherlands (Dutch: Verenigde Nederlanden), the state that briefly existed under Sovereign Prince William I of Orange Nassau, the latter King William I of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, after the French Empire was driven out of the Dutch territories. The United Kingdom of the Netherlands was born. The Protestant King of the Netherlands, William I rapidly started the industrialisation of the southern parts of the Kingdom. The political system that was set up however, <b>slowly</b> <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> failed to forge a true union between the northern and the southern parts of the Kingdom. The southern bourgeoisie mainly was Roman Catholic, {{in contrast to the}} mainly Protestant north; large parts of the southern bourgeoisie also primarily spoke French rather than Dutch.|$|E
25|$|England's fourth Super Eight {{game was}} against Bangladesh, who had proven {{themselves}} to be tricky opposition, having beaten South Africa in their previous match. However, the Tiger's were bowled out for just 143, with Sajid Mahmood and Monty Panesar each taking three wickets. Nixon took two catches, both off the bowling of James Anderson. In the chase, England struggled, crumbling to 110–6, with an awkward 34 still needed for victory. Nixon, along with Paul Collingwood, <b>slowly</b> <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> chipped away at the total and took England to a four wicket win. Nixon finished on 20 not out, hitting a 4 and a 6 along the way. He faced 39 deliveries, compared to Collingwood's 74, for 23 runs. This crucial partnership of 37 kept their nation's World Cup dream alive. This knock took Nixon's average in the competition to 51.33, bettered in the England team only by the stalwart Collingwood and the expansive Pietersen.|$|E
50|$|Then he met Ross, the guy {{who made}} him fall in love like he never did. He never felt more special. But then, a painful event took them apart. Ross gave him a {{stethoscope}} before he bid goodbye. Dave then, <b>slowly</b> and <b>surely</b> <b>but</b> not completely, moved on and became successful in his studies. He graduated with flying colors and became a doctor.Then an unexpected encounter presented shocking revelations to Dave that made everything clear to him. Why he was raped, why Ross left, why a hundred crumpled fliers containing libelous information flew towards Dave at the Barn bar 6 years ago, why Ross did something Dave never thought he could. He knew why - {{he knew that it}} was because of revenge, HIV-AIDS, and Ross’ incomparable love for Dave.|$|R

25|$|The post lunch {{session was}} one of the most {{dramatic}} sessions in Test history. VVS Laxman played one of his best knocks along with Ishant Sharma for most of the post lunch session. He was happy to give Ishant most of the strike with Ishant stone-walling the rest of the over. Occasional boundaries (mainly from Sharma) and early singles off every over had India <b>slowly,</b> <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> inching towards their target. In what seemed like forever, India crawled from 124/8 to 170, 180 and 190/8. Finally Ishant got out to a Ben Hilfenhaus lbw decision that replays showed was going down the leg side, with the score at 205. Pragyan Ojha, the last man for India joined Laxman at the crease. During Mitchell Johnson's over more drama followed with Ojha being clearly struck in line, but On-field Umpire Billy Bowden turned down the appeal. Pragyan Ojha tried to sneak a single when substitute fielder Steven Smith shied at the stumps. But unfortunately for Australia, no fielders where backing his throw. It went for four overthrows meaning India just needed 2 runs to win.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of the early Muslim conquests of the seventh and eighth centuries, the {{hitherto}} largely uninfluential Arabic language <b>slowly</b> <b>but</b> <b>surely</b> replaced many (but not all) of the indigenous Semitic languages and cultures of the Near East. Both the Near East and North Africa saw an influx of Muslim Arabs from the Arabian Peninsula, followed later by non-Semitic Muslim Iranian and Turkic peoples. The previously dominant Aramaic dialects gradually began to be sidelined, however descendant dialects of Eastern Aramaic (including the Akkadian influenced Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, Chaldean Neo-Aramaic, Turoyo and Mandaic) survive to this day among the Assyrians and Mandaeans of northern Iraq, northwestern Iran, northeastern Syria and southeastern Turkey, with up to a million fluent speakers. Western Aramaic is now only spoken by a few thousand Syriac Christians in western Syria. The Arabs spread their Central Semitic language to North Africa (Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and northern Sudan and Mauritania) where it gradually replaced Egyptian Coptic and many Berber languages (although Berber is still largely extant in many areas), and for a time to the Iberian Peninsula (modern Spain, Portugal and Gibraltar) and Malta.|$|E

500|$|To {{understand}} {{his place in}} modern music you probably have to first go back to punk rock and its misguided attempt to kick aside {{what remained of the}} psychedelic 1960s.

[...] Writing for The Guardian, Michael Cragg said there was [...] "something indescribably captivating" [...] about the song, and likened it to the group's debut single [...] "Overload"—as the Sugababes.
