40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>pelagic</b> {{fish are}} termed “wasp-waist” species as they {{dominate}} mid trophic levels and comprise relatively few species but attain large abundances that can vary drastically in size. They {{have been found}} to exert top-down control on their prey species and bottom-up control on their predators and, in this way, appear to induce unsuspected ecosystem dynamics. Largely based on model results, this chapter explores these effects and associated dynamics, not only illustrating the importance of <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish in structuring marine ecosystems, but also revealing the consistency of the role of <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish across various upwelling systems in which they play key roles. The Northern and Southern Benguela, Southern Humboldt, South Catalan Sea and North and Central Adriatic Sea ecosystems are compared in terms of the importance and role of <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish using information gained from landings and ecological models. Trophic level of the catch, the Fishing-in-Balance (FiB) index and the ratio of pelagic:demersal fish are calculated from reported landings. Sums of all flows to detritus are compared across modelled ecosystems. Models of the Southern Benguela, Southern Humboldt and South Catalan Sea are used to perform two simulations: (1) closure of fisheries on <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish and (2) collapse of <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish stocks, to further explore the roles of <b>small</b> <b>pelagic</b> fish in the dynamics of these ecosystems.

Documentary {{scientific}} evidence supports {{the notion that}} the <b>small</b> <b>pelagics</b> fishery in the Gulf of California does not measurably affect the physical habitat or the functional relationships between the species comprising the pelagic ecosystem.

Under the current management regime, <b>small</b> <b>pelagics</b> fishery in the Gulf of California has recovered twice from collapses during the last 30 years. Although the <b>small</b> <b>pelagics</b> abundance varies greatly, the long-term productivity of the target species and the structure and function of the pelagic ecosystem are not compromised because the fishery relies on a suitable logistic and administrative platform, which is consistent with international standards for responsible fisheries, precautionary approach and ecosystem-based fisheries management principles...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{group of}} small pelagic fish {{is the largest}} species group landed globally. A {{significant}} proportion of this nutrient-rich food is processed and lost to livestock feed, fish feed, fish oil, pet food and omega-rich vitamins. The nutritional importance of <b>small</b> <b>pelagics</b> as an easily digestible protein source, rich in essential lipids with fatty acids (EPA/DHA), essential amino acids, minerals and vitamins, is well known and documented. <b>Small</b> <b>pelagics</b> contain {{all the elements of}} a healthy and nutritionally optimal food source for humans and are an important contributor to the food and nutritional security of many poor, low-income households in developing countries. Findings: Large-scale and small-scale fisheries {{play an important role in}} contributing to food security and nutrition. Yet, all of the anchovy landings from large-scale fisheries are reduced to animal feed, fish oil and pet food in South Africa. The size of the species, labour costs and lack of incentives by the state are some of the challenges to redirecting anchovy for human consumption. This trend is also now prevalent in Tanzania, where most (84 %) of the dagaa fished is reduced to fishmeal in Kenya, mainly to feed chickens. The main challenges are post-harvest handling and sanitation. Conclusions: The redirecting of <b>small</b> <b>pelagics</b> to human consumption will depend on the role of the state in Tanzania and South Africa in investing in post-harvest processing. The role small-scale fisheries play in providing fish for food security needs to be understood in the context of economic viability and of how data are reported in this sector as compared to large-scale fisheries.

40|$|The EcoTroph model {{leaves aside}} {{the notion of}} species, and models the {{functioning}} of marine ecosystems as flows of biomass from low to high trophic levels, so as to quantify easily the impacts of fishing at an ecosystem scale. In this paper, based on two case studies we present a new development of the EcoTroph model that {{is devoted to the}} analysis of fishery interactions and impacts of fleet segments on ecosystems. First, deriving an EcoTroph model from an Ecopath model of the Guinea ecosystem, the impacts of the artisanal fishery are distinguished from those of the industrial fishery. It appears that these fisheries do not always compete for the same fish groups but that they both strongly impact the ecosystem and moderately impact one another. Then, an EcoTroph model of the Southern Benguela ecosystem is set up, also based on a pre-existing Ecopath model. Two scenarios are simulated: a doubling in the fishing mortality of <b>small</b> <b>pelagics</b> and a doubling in the fishing mortality of hake. An increase in fishing mortality of <b>small</b> <b>pelagics</b> causes a strong decrease in biomass at all trophic levels of the ecosystem, confirming the pivotal role of these "wasp-waist" species in this ecosystem...|$|E
