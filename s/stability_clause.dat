5000|$|The <b>stability</b> <b>clause</b> in {{this chapter}} of the plan, in which the {{government}} undertakes for a decade to not only not legislate but to also fight any legislation against the plan’s provisions, was determined without authority - and as such is rejected. It was determined in contrast to the general principle of administrative law regarding the prohibition of shackling the authority’s ability to judge. The government does not have the power to decide not to decide and not to act. Elyakim Rubinstein ...|$|E
5000|$|TheMarker {{argued that}} the <b>stability</b> <b>clause</b> unconstitutional as it {{prevented}} future governments from governing by creating laws. TheMarker also {{argued that the}} price was not competitive, pointing to the falling global prices of natural gas. In August 2015, the government agency {{in charge of the}} electricity market issues a report that stated the outline would be equal to a “7.3 million shekels fine” on the Israeli public (approx. 1.9 billion dollars). [...] Following that report, Netanyahu fired the agency’s director. Following the outline and Netanyahu’s handling of the controversies, a few demonstrations and rallies were held, the largest of which took place on November 14, 2015, in Tel Aviv.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{is focused on}} reinsurance. Most simply, reinsurance {{can be described as}} insurance of insurance portfolios written by insurers. In our research, two aspects which are of importance in the daily practice of reinsurance will be considered. The combination of two reinsurance methods will be considered, by which will be looked for, {{on the basis of the}} “main-variance” principle, how the two methods can be combined in an optimal way in order to minimalize the extra reinsurance cost above the expected reinsurance recovery for a given retained volatility. Assuming that the supplementary reinsurance cost is proportional with the expected reinsurance recovery, where this proportionality factor changes according to the reinsurance method and the volatility is measured on basis of the variance. Combinations of the following reinsurance methods are taken into consideration : quota share (a fixed percentage for all risks are ceded proportionally to the reinsurance market), surplus (each risk is proportionally ceded by which the percentage per risk is determined by the exposure (ie the insured value) which exceeds a certain amount), excess of loss (the portion of each loss exceeding a certain amount is paid by the reinsurance market), and stop loss (the portion of the annual loss exceeding a certain amount is paid by the reinsurance market). The most important conclusions we obtain are that the optimal combination does not change when we modify all proportionality factors of the margins with the same factor. Further, we believe that the order of application of a quota share with an excess of loss (or a stop loss) effectively and a surplus have their importance. Another topic of the daily reinsurance practice is the benchmarking of commercial premium rates of excess of loss contracts which protect a motorcar third party liability insurance portfolio, without the use of loss statistics. Here we consider that the commercial premiums can be described as the expected value of a compound process by which the loss distribution is a Burr or Pareto distribution. Within the (mixed) generalized non-linear regression models the parameters are estimated on basis of the observed premium rates (premium relative to premium income of the insurance portfolio). Those estimations take into account the impact of the typical reinsurance clauses such as <b>stability</b> <b>clause</b> (determination of the loss inflation per loss and distribution hereof between both parties), interest sharing clause (distribution of the loss interest between both parties), deposit clause (determination of the financial revenues of the loss reserves) and the influence of the payment pattern. By using mixed models the parameters are individualized per insurer. The important result we become is that the reinsurance premiums can be estimated for alternatives by which clauses and/or excess of loss covers change, as well for the individual insurers as for homogeneous groups. nrpages: 124 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis, relates mainly to the current method of design of steel portal frame structures. The study {{is divided into two}} major parts, first being the full-scale test on a 24 metre span frame and the second deals with the problems of lateral-torsional buckling in the haunch region of the frame. Detailed accounts of the full-scale testing on the 24 metre span frame and the experimental results are given. Supplementary tests on beams cut out from the tested frame in order to establish the strain-hardening factor are also presented. A literature survey on the published material pertinent to the lateral torsional-buckling of a tapered member was undertaken. Different methods of treatment for the elastic stability of tapered members and any evidence from previous research in this area were reviewed. Details of an appropriate finite element and the corresponding computer programme are given. This section describes the assumptions and the Finite Element formulations adopted in the computer programme. The earlier work on this analysis dealt only with prismatic members and this was extended to solve tapered sections. Therefore, a full calibration of the finite element formulation for a tapered member was carried out. The <b>stability</b> <b>clauses</b> in BS 5950 are introduced systematically. Theoretical work which leads to the formulation of the clauses in Appendix G is also described. These <b>stability</b> <b>clauses</b> were assessed by the analysis of selected prismatic and tapered members using the finite element formulation. From this assessment some modifications to the clauses are proposed. The results of the modified clauses are compared with those given by the finite element analysis and the original clauses. Lastly, the modified clauses are checked with the results of the portal frame tested, to confirm its validity. This study leads to the proposal for some amendments in the clauses in Appendix G and Clause 5. 5. 3. 5. of BS 5950...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is the {{threshold}} beyond which compensation is payable for breach of a stabilisation clause. The discussion {{is based on the}} tax <b>stability</b> <b>clauses</b> contained in the mining development agreements unilaterally cancelled by the Government of the Republic of Zambia in early 2008. The outstanding characteristic feature of the tax <b>stability</b> <b>clauses</b> was government’s undertaking that it shall not, for the stability periods ranging between 10 to 20 years, introduce new fiscal measures resulting in a “material adverse effect” on the distributable profits of the mining companies or the dividends received by the shareholders of the companies. Government further undertook to ‘fully’ and ‘fairly’ compensate mining companies should such measures be introduced during the stability periods. The question investigated by the thesis is whether the fiscal measures introduced by government in early 2008, as amended in 2009, have resulted in a “material adverse effect” on the distributable profits of mining companies or the dividends received by the shareholders of the companies and, therefore, entitle mining companies to compensation from government. The main findings of the thesis, among others, are that: The threshold beyond which the obligation to pay compensation is triggered varies considerably depending on the specific contractual formulation of the stabilisation clause involved. However, it is significantly lower than the threshold beyond which host States must pay compensation in regulatory taking cases. Although there are several international arbitral awards in which payment of compensation has been ordered for breach of a freezing stabilisation clause, there is no known similar award in cases involving breach of an economic equilibrium stabilisation clause. Even in cases in which compensation has been ordered for breach of a stabilisation clause, {{there is no evidence of}} how much the presence of a stabilisation clause contributes to the total quantum of the compensation awarded. The tribunals either take a "contractual perspective" or an "expropriation perspective" to arrive at their respective decisions on the quantum of compensation. International arbitral tribunals take into account any ‘excessive’ or ‘windfall profits’ made by investors in deciding the quantum of compensation payable to the investor for breach of a stabilisation <b>clause.</b> The tax <b>stability</b> <b>clauses</b> contained in the mining development agreements cancelled by the Zambian government are typical economic equilibrium stabilisation clauses. Based on these findings, among others, the thesis has concluded that there are equal chances that the Zambian government may or may not be ordered to pay compensation to the aggrieved mining companies. Notwithstanding this conclusion, however, the thesis has noted that government’s unilateral cancellation of the mining development agreements has potential to negate the country’s investment image. Against this background, the recommendation of the thesis is that government and the aggrieved mining companies must engage in discussions with a view to reaching at an amicable solution to their standoff. The rationale behind the recommendation is that an amicable solution presents a perfect opportunity for both parties to come up with a decision that is mutually beneficial to their interests. Also it is less costly than international arbitration. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010. Centre for Human Rightsunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse how contractual stabilization devices have evolved since the late 1990 s, based on a survey of 20 countries and a review of the literature and evidence on stabilization <b>clauses.</b> Although fiscal <b>stability</b> is a commonly cited attribute of a desirable upstream petroleum regime, one of the commonly observed features of existing regimes is the lack of stability. The paper studies the major triggers that push host governments to revise the fiscal terms to which they originally agreed with investors; amongst various economic and political factors, one of the obvious drivers is the oil price. Chasing the price of oil, however, is a burdensome and inefficient strategy, as oil is an internationally traded commodity where short-term price volatility is the norm. The paperâs three broad conclusions include: First, classical stabilization models have not been successful in practice; Second, the more modern clauses are more likely to treat changes in fiscal terms symmetrically, and may be equally beneficial to governments and oil companies; Third, modern stabilization clauses can allow policymakers to consider the overall tax system and its impact on revenue and growth, without worrying about the specific impact on the oil and gas sector, and without penalizing investors in the sector. Fiscal <b>stability</b> <b>clauses</b> in developing countries will remain a key feature of contractual agreements and oil and gas laws for years to come. However, the effectiveness of the more modern clauses in achieving the desired outcome remains as questionable as that of previous stability models, particularly in countries which continue to lack the administrative capability to enforce these mechanisms, and where government policy in general and investment laws and the judiciary in particular lack credibility...|$|R
