2500|$|Dante's day {{is spent}} in the purgatory of serving a {{succession}} of customers while repeating {{the fact that he}} is [...] "not even <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> today". Stressed with the demands of his job, Dante passes time in wide-ranging conversations with his best friend, Randal Graves. Randal is an irresponsible slacker who works in the next-door video store, RST Video, although he spends most of the day at the Quick Stop, neglecting the video store's customers. They converse about many things to pass time, such as whether or not the contractors working on the second Death Star when it was destroyed at the end of Return of the Jedi were innocent victims. Other events of the day include the discovery that Dante's high school girlfriend, Caitlin Bree, whom he has been having early morning phone conversations with, is engaged to be married. Dante's current girlfriend, Veronica Loughran, also stops in to bring him homemade lasagne. The two talk about Dante's stuck-in-a-rut lifestyle with no motivation to change before having an argument about her past sexual partners.|$|E

Duke Nukem 3D is known for having many such messages written on walls in some levels. His chosen pseudonym dates back to his early work on what became Blood starting in September 1994, based on how he signed off e-mails to designer Nick Newhard. His transfer to the Duke Nukem 3D team in March 1995 was one of the causes of the strain that lead to Blood being published by GT Interactive over 3D Realms.|$|E

Dante's day is spent in the purgatory of serving a succession of customers while repeating {{the fact that he is}} [...] "not even <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> today". Randal works in the next-door video store, RST Video, although he spends almost the entire day at the Quick Stop. Learning that he is stuck working the store all day, Dante eventually decides to close the store for brief periods to either play hockey (on the roof of the store) or to attend a wake of an ex-girlfriend. Dante also encounters a surprise visit from an old flame who is engaged. The two had been talking on the phone for months and after seeing each other again they are keen to reunite and leave their current relationships.|$|E

Will he break the fatal cycle or fall into eternal despair?Eternal Rest is a short story I co-authored with fellow Honors student, friend, and roommate Casey Fish. It addresses several concepts of existentialism — reality, acceptance, eternal recurrence, and death —that we drew from some of our Honors classes at Ball State and explores them in narrative form. The story also gave Casey and me a chance to experiment with a concept that has always fascinated both of us: time travel. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|E

There was a pause. The woman's right hand kept a constant beat going on her desk with her pencil as her left hand began to shuffle through a stack of papers. Hearing the voice return {{on the other end of}} the line, the woman winked victoriously at the couple seated there in the small office. "Okay, Bill. We'll bring them over soon.
