40|$|A {{number of}} other {{protocols}} may make use of HTTP syntax and facilities; this memo defines a mechanism for IANA to allocate <b>status</b> <b>codes.</b> 1 <b>Status</b> <b>Codes</b> HTTP <b>status</b> <b>codes</b> are defined in RFC 2068 [1], Section 10. Other protocols that share HTTP syntax and standard <b>status</b> <b>codes</b> may need to add additional <b>status</b> <b>codes.</b> In addition, implementors may want to define new <b>status</b> <b>codes</b> for HTTP in an interoperable manner. This memo establishes a mechanism that charges the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to manage the HTTP <b>status</b> <b>code</b> space under the heading "Status codes for HTTP and HTTP-derived protocols". We use the notation "x 00 [...] x 49 " to indicate <b>status</b> <b>codes</b> having any digit as their first digit and the twodigit numbers zero through 49 as their second and third digits. Examples include the range 400 through 449. IANA manages the <b>status</b> <b>codes</b> of "HTTP and HTTP-derived protocols" under the following guidelines: ffl <b>Status</b> <b>codes</b> x 00 through x 49 are reserved for general use of HTTP [...] ...|$|R

If the device receives a HTTP 204 <b>status</b> <b>code,</b> it assumes it has unlimited internet access.
