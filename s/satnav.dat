50|$|Since 2001 minicabs {{have been}} subject to some {{regulation}} in London and most other local authorities. London minicabs are now licensed by TFL (London Taxis and Private Hire), or LTPH, formerly known as the Public Carriage Office. This is the same body that now regulates London's licensed taxicabs, but minicab drivers do not have to complete 'The Knowledge', and although they must undergo a small 'topographical test' in order to obtain a 'Private Hire' Drivers Licence, they generally rely on <b>satnavs</b> or local knowledge to take them to the pick up and destination. All vehicles available for pre-booking by London minicab drivers must hold a PH licence showing that the vehicles are fit for purpose; this is updated with 'mot tests' twice a year after an inspection at a licensed garage. In London new applicants must send their 'Topographical test Certificate' along with their application to the PH Driver Licensing Section of the LTPH.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} content distribution between devices mounted in moving vehicles using commodity WiFi. We assume that each device stores content {{in a set of}} files, and that each file has a version number. When two devices come into wireless range, they attempt to synchronize the latest versions of any files they have in common. This is challenging because connections are often short-lived and have variable link quality. Prior work demonstrates that current protocols perform badly under these conditions. To motivate this work, we use the example of Personal Navigation Devices (PNDs), or <b>SatNavs,</b> where the content to be exchanged includes maps and points-of-interest files. We describe a protocol enabling devices in vehicles to identify and exchange content of shared interest. We evaluate the protocol using a small vehicular testbed in two urban locations and on a highway with a closing speed of 140 MPH. We {{investigate the}} effects of using 802. 11 a versus 802. 11 g, placing the antenna inside or outside the vehicle, and varying the packet size. We transfer up to 70 MB in the urban settings and 7 MB on the highway...|$|R
25|$|The EZ {{series of}} flat-6-cylinder engines, used in current Legacy products, {{replaced}} the EG series {{found in the}} Subaru SVX. Subaru has produced high-performance versions of the Legacy with a Bilstein suspension and tuned turbocharged engines equivalent to the homologated rally version WRX STI (generating 205kW (275hp) on manufacturer's figures for the 2.0L equivalent engine with manual transmission). Recent 3.0L engines move close to the 2.0L turbo output and share the Bilstein suspension. 2.0L-engined turbocharged models with the Bilstein suspension were named either the GT-B (for wagons), or Spec B, or B4-RSK (for sedans). The new 2003 model moved many models to simply B4 or even GT in some countries. In Australia, the 2.5GT (<b>SatNav)</b> marks {{the top of the}} pile for the Legacy/Liberty range.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this work is to gauge user {{opinions}} on vehicle dashboard design to ascertain the criteria important to consumers {{for the next generation}} of automobile dashboards. The results provide insight into the aspects of dashboard design that users feel are not beneficial and thereby lead to better informed dashboard designs in the future. Participants reviewed the physical ergonomics of their vehicles very positively. However, in dashboard design and instrument panel layout they were unsure of what an ideal dashboard would look like, often showing contradictory views. Controls on the steering wheel were also well reviewed but controls near the gear stick were not. In terms of vehicle technology <b>Satnavs</b> received good scoring for effectiveness but were reported as distracting. IVISs were negatively reviewed. Finally, automation was reviewed as potentially improving the daily lives of individuals but trust in automation is still a problem. Overall, this study showed that whilst dashboards are relatively well reviewed there are still issues to be addressed regarding in-vehicle technology and distraction, as well as improving public opinion on automated vehicles. Results represent the first stage in research studying current dashboards and distraction of in-vehicle technology and the design of automated dashboards of the future using virtual reality environments to create optimal console designs for drivers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Artificial {{agents of}} many kinds {{increasingly}} intrude {{into the human}} sphere. <b>SatNavs,</b> help systems, automatic telephone answering systems, and even robotic vacuum cleaners are positioned {{to do more than}} exist on the side-lines as potential tools. These devices, intentionally or not, often act in a way that intrudes into our social life. Virtual assistants pop up offering help when an error is encountered, the robot vacuum cleaner starts to clean while one is having tea with the vicar, and automated call handling systems refuse to let you do what you want until you have answered a list of questions. This paper addresses {{the problem of how to}} produce artificial agents that are less socially inept. A distinction is drawn between things which are operationally available to us as human conversationalists and the things that are available to a third party (e. g. a scientists or engineer) in terms of an explicit explanation or representation. The former implies a detailed skill at recognising and negotiating the subtle and context-dependent rules of human social interaction, but this skill is largely unconscious – we do not know how we do it, in the sense of the later kind of understanding. The paper propose...|$|R
40|$|Background: Orienteering sports {{practitioners}} develop {{cognitive skills}} and strategies that {{enable them to}} approach their task efﬁciently, i. e. using map and compass to navigate from place to place (Millet et al., 2010). Little is known about whether practicing orienteering improves an individual’s spatial abilities (Cornoldi et al., 2003), spatial preferences, and efﬁcacy in everyday movements. Aims: This study investigated whether practicing orienteering fur- thers the development of good spatial skills, spatial preferences and efﬁcacy in everyday movements. Method: Three groups of participants selected by years of orien- teering experience (OE) — 18 controls (OE = 0; age: 42. 33), 18 beginners (OE = 4. 6 age: 24. 65); and 18 experts (OE = 21. 56; age: 45. 89) —completed several visuospatial tasks and questionnaires (De Beni et al., 2014), and a questionnaire on their movements and wayﬁnding methods. They also studied a map and their recall was tested with map drawing and aligned and counter-aligned pointing tasks. Results: By comparison with controls and beginners, experts: (i) were more accurate in visuospatial tasks; (ii) had a stronger self-assessed sense of direction and preference for allocentric strategies; (iii) were more accurate in counter-aligned pointing at landmarks on a map (and as accurate as for aligned pointing); and (iv) scored higher for using maps as everyday navigation aids (and lower for using <b>satnavs</b> or asking for directions) -, and lower for getting lost in unfamiliar places. Conclusions: This study showed that extended practice with orien- teering improves spatial competences (abilities and preferences) and everyday movement habits by comparison with little or no practice...|$|R

50|$|A {{satellite}} navigation or <b>satnav</b> {{system is a}} system that uses satellites to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning. It allows small electronic receivers to determine their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation) to high precision (within a few metres) using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites. The system can be used for providing position, navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver (satellite tracking). The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to high precision, which allows time synchronisation. <b>Satnav</b> systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated.|$|E
