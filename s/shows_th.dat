This enables {{the exchange of}} nucleons which is usually accompanied by the dissipation of kinetic energy. During this time the nuclei stick together. We investigated 238 U + 238 U (Z = 184) collisions at the VAMOS spectrometer at GANIL at five beam energies in the interval (6. 09 − 7. 35) ×A MeV. At 6. 09 ×A MeV the Coulomb barrier is not reached at all mutual orientations of the deformed uranium nuclei. The spectrometer covered the angles (35 ± 5) °. We observed a massive transfer of nucleons resulting in reaction products far from the entrance channel. Only nuclei lighter than uranium were observed. The transfer was correlated with a large energy dissipation of up to several 100 MeV. Fig. 1 <b>shows</b> <b>th...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{electron}} microscopic {{picture of}} the heart muscle {{differs from that of}} the skeletal muscle of the same animal, not so much by significant differences {{in the structure of the}} myofibrils, but rather by the amount of sarcosomes (1) present in the muscle fiber. In the skeletal muscle there are only a few sarcosomes in each field between the myofibrils, whereas in the heart muscle at the same magnifications there are innumerable masses, filling the space between the individual myofibrils and the space between sarcolemma and myofibrils. This may explain the ability of the heart muscle to work for a lifetime without longer rest, because the sarcosomes contain most important metabolic enzymes. It also explains why, in the electron microscopic picture, the myofibrils of the heart are never seen so tightly packed as in the skeletal muscle of the same animal. As a rule, these sarcosomes are of irregular, spherical, or ellipsoid shape in the heart, whereas in the skeletal muscle they are more frequently oblong, or ribbon-shaped.
