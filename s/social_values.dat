5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how <b>social</b> <b>values</b> affect science.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim is to}} analyze, {{define and}} examine the {{connections}} between social entrepreneurship and the generation of <b>social</b> <b>value,</b> considering the concept of leakage {{as a measure of}} <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation and distribution for the hospitality industry. The paper also proposes an exploratory-theoretical framework of policies to promote social entrepreneurship in hospitality, reduce leakage, and increase the generation of <b>social</b> <b>value.</b> Firstly, the paper concentrates on the figure of the social entrepreneur as a promoter of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation. Secondly, it analyzes <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation in hospitality and its measurement. Then, the article studies and presents leakage as an instrument to monitor <b>social</b> <b>value</b> created by <b>social</b> entrepreneurship in hospitality. Finally, the paper proposes a wide framework of policies to enhance <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation in hospitality, through the reduction of leakage and reinforcement of social entrepreneurship. Leakage is a useful indicator to monitor <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation in the hospitality industry. The reduction of leakage can gauge the success of policies promoting social entrepreneurship activities which improve <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation for the host society. The paper proposes proper and idiosyncratic measures of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation in hospitality. It also provides a mechanism to measure the effectiveness of the actions designed to generate social entrepreneurship and <b>social</b> <b>value,</b> at a destination and also at firm or hotel level.

Despite {{the widespread use of}} measures of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> orientations in <b>social</b> dilemma experiments, little is known about their stability, reliability and validity.

In three studies, we examined this moderating influence. In Study 1, we investigated the temporal stability of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> orientations and found that high consistent orientations are more stable than low consistent orientations.

40|$|There {{were several}} {{attempts}} to conceptualize the <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation process. Previous literature does not commonly consider a non-material approach, using mainly quantitative practices {{which are not}} {{in line with the}} characteristics of <b>social</b> <b>value.</b> This thesis contributes to the current <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation studies in two ways. The first centers the subjectivity of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> as a phenomenon embedded in space and time which calls for distinctive ways of understanding its creation. Here the research approaches the hedonic perspective of well-being as a processual phenomenon which makes possible to explore the way <b>social</b> <b>value</b> is created from beneficiaries’ perspective. The second contribution is an empirical study within a voluntary program in order to explore how the beneficiaries’ subjective well-being unfolds over time. In this setting, where impoverished people deal with satisfying their basic needs, a process approach reveals the emotionally loaded context and the complexity of the <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation. Thereby, the main emphasis of this thesis is to put on a deeper theoretical discussion of the concept of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation. The result of this research is an understanding of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation as a subjective construct centered on how the process uncovers unique moments experienced by people. ...|$|R

5|$|Because {{of the new}} {{limitations}} {{placed on}} future Merina monarchs by Rainilaiarivony and the Hova courtiers, Radama's strangling represented {{more than a simple}} coup d'état. The ruling conditions imposed on Rasoherina reflected a power shift toward the oligarchs of the Hova commoner class and away from the Andriana sovereigns, who had traditionally drawn their legitimacy from the deeply held cultural belief that the royal line was imbued with hasina, a sacred authority bestowed by the ray aman-dreny (ancestors). In this respect, the new political structure in Imerina embodied the erosion of certain traditional <b>social</b> <b>values</b> among the Merina elite, who had gained exposure to contemporary European political thought and assimilated a number of Western governance principles. It also signalled the expansion of a rift between the pro-European, progressive elite to which Rainilaiarivony and his brother belonged, and {{the majority of the population}} in Madagascar, for whom traditional values such as hasina remained integral to determining the legitimacy of a government—a divide that would deepen in the decades to come through Rainilaiarivony's efforts to effect a modernizing political and social transformation on a nationwide scale.|$|E

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>value</b> {{in recent}} years has been {{attracting}} increased attention from public clients where policy documents encouraged clients to maximise their additional outcomes when procuring goods and services. However, <b>social</b> <b>value</b> studies in recent times show how there are problems accompanying its delivery with publicly procured projects, where confusion of definition among public procurers, the lack of methodologies and mechanics to calculate and implement the delivery processes and the absence of assessment and measurement methods caused hindrance to <b>social</b> <b>value</b> inclusion. This paper discusses how using Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) would improve the delivery of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> outcomes for publicly procured projects. Since <b>social</b> <b>value</b> as a subject is considered to be of vague it cannot be approached in a similar way of well-defined construction deliverables, therefore SSM is adopted to accommodate its characteristics. The inability to define <b>social</b> <b>value</b> outcomes can be dealt with using the culture stream of inquiry specifically rich picture building which includes multiple stakeholder perspectives of reality. On the other hand, lacking methodologies and mechanisms to implement <b>social</b> <b>value</b> can be improved through logic based inquiry stream and Human Activity System modelling where stakeholders can have their input conceptualised into models which is compared to the real world situation to find most suitable answers. Measurement and assessment of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> can improve through improving the definition and the implementation processes.

30|$|The term “social value” mostly {{signifies the}} {{wellbeing}} {{of people and}} communities, built {{on a set of}} basic <b>values.</b> In <b>social</b> psychology, <b>social</b> <b>value</b> orientation is connected to research on social dilemmas and is defined as “the importance an individual attaches to their own and others’ outcomes in situations of social interdependence” (Joireman et al. 2001). <b>Social</b> <b>value</b> creation is a term frequently used in literature, though there has been inadequate effort to conceptualize it (Sinkovics, Sinkovics, Hoque, & Czaban 2015). In social entrepreneurship literature, <b>social</b> <b>value</b> creation is inclusive of altruistic and virtuous behavior, and promotion of social purposes (Choi & Majumdar 2014). It is an intervention creating positive change, i.e. <b>social</b> <b>value,</b> for subjective well-being and life satisfaction (Kroeger & Weber 2014) of people seeking subsistence, or amour propre, or freedom from subjection or enslavement (Sinkovics et al. 2015). <b>Social</b> <b>value</b> creation is achieved by successfully attending complex and diverse ‘social cause-attractors’ (Dietz & Porter 2012), i.e. social issues, with priority over economic value. While popular wisdom talks about the social mission leading to the creation of <b>social</b> <b>value,</b> not much of social entrepreneurship literature was found which elicited the concept of <b>social</b> <b>value</b> (Stevens, Nathalie, & Johan 2015).
