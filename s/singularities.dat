5|$|Given {{that these}} {{examples}} are all highly symmetric—and thus simplified—it {{is tempting to}} conclude that the occurrence of <b>singularities</b> is an artifact of idealization. The famous singularity theorems, proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: <b>singularities</b> are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage and also {{at the beginning of a}} wide class of expanding universes. However, the theorems say little about the properties of <b>singularities,</b> and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the BKL conjecture). The cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future <b>singularities</b> (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to all other}} modern theories of fundamental interactions, general relativity is a classical theory: {{it does not include}} the effects of quantum physics. The quest for a quantum version of general relativity addresses one of the most fundamental open questions in physics. While there are promising candidates for such a theory of quantum gravity, notably string theory and loop quantum gravity, there is at present no consistent and complete theory. It has long been hoped that a theory of quantum gravity would also eliminate another problematic feature of general relativity: the presence of spacetime <b>singularities.</b> These <b>singularities</b> are boundaries ("sharp edges") of spacetime at which geometry becomes ill-defined, with the consequence that general relativity itself loses its predictive power. Furthermore, there are so-called singularity theorems which predict that such <b>singularities</b> must exist within the universe if the laws of general relativity were to hold without any quantum modifications. The best-known examples are the <b>singularities</b> associated with the model universes that describe black holes {{and the beginning of the}} universe.|$|E

50|$|In general relativity, a naked <b>singularity</b> is a {{gravitational}} <b>singularity</b> {{without an}} event horizon.

5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has emerged}} as a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology, which has so far passed many unambiguous observational and experimental tests. However, there are strong indications the theory is incomplete. The problem of quantum gravity and the question of the reality of spacetime <b>singularities</b> remain open. Observational data that is taken as evidence for dark energy and dark matter could indicate the need for new physics. Even taken as is, general relativity is rich with possibilities for further exploration. Mathematical relativists seek {{to understand the nature of}} <b>singularities</b> and the fundamental properties of Einstein's equations, while numerical relativists run increasingly powerful computer simulations (such as those describing merging black holes). In February 2016, it was announced that the existence of gravitational waves was directly detected by the Advanced LIGO team on September 14, 2015. A century after its introduction, general relativity remains a highly active area of research.|$|E
5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{has also}} been studied for curves in {{three-dimensional}} Euclidean space. The normal vector in this case can be defined (as in the plane) as the derivative of the tangent vector with respect to arc length, normalized to be a unit vector; {{it is one of}} the components of the Frenet–Serret frame. It is not well defined at points of zero curvature, but the product of the curvature and the normal vector remains well defined at those points, allowing the curve-shortening flow to be defined. Curves in space may cross each other or themselves according to this flow, and the flow may lead to <b>singularities</b> in the curves; every singularity is asymptotic to a plane. The curve shortening flow for space curves has been used as a way to define flow past <b>singularities</b> in plane curves.|$|E

5|$|An ancient {{solution}} to a flow problem is a curve whose evolution can be extrapolated backwards for all time, without <b>singularities.</b> All of the self-similar solutions that shrink or stay the same size rather than growing are ancient solutions in this sense; they can be extrapolated backwards by reversing the self-similarity transformation that they would undergo by the forwards curve-shortening flow. Thus, for instance, the circle, grim reaper, and Abresch–Langer curves are all ancient solutions.|$|E
5|$|Curves {{that have}} self-crossings may reach <b>singularities</b> before {{contracting}} to a point. For instance, if a lemniscate (any smooth immersed curve {{with a single}} crossing, resembling a figure 8 or infinity symbol) has unequal areas in its two lobes, then eventually the smaller lobe will collapse to a point. However, if the two lobes have equal areas, then they will remain equal throughout {{the evolution of the}} curve, and the isoperimetric ratio will diverge as the curve collapses to a singularity.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{gravitational}} collapse of null {{dust in the}} cylindrically symmetric spacetime. The naked <b>singularity</b> necessarily forms at the symmetry axis. We consider {{the situation in which}} null dust is emitted again from the naked <b>singularity</b> formed by the collapsed null dust and investigate the back-reaction by this emission for the naked <b>singularity.</b> We show a very peculiar but physically important case in which the same amount of null dust as that of the collapsed one is emitted from the naked <b>singularity</b> as soon as the ingoing null dust hits the symmetry axis and forms the naked <b>singularity.</b> In this case, although this naked <b>singularity</b> satisfies the strong curvature condition by Królak (limiting focusing condition), geodesics which hit the <b>singularity</b> can be extended uniquely across the <b>singularity.</b> Therefore we may say that the collapsing null dust passes through the <b>singularity</b> formed by itself and then leaves for infinity.

40|$|Stress <b>singularity</b> at a vertex in {{three-dimensional}} joints {{is closely}} related to the strength of joints. It is very important to analyze for evaluating the reliability in a three-dimensional joint. However, the stress <b>singularity</b> field near a vertex and along a stress <b>singularity</b> line is not made still clear. In the present study, we investigated the characteristics of stress <b>singularity</b> field at a vertex and a point located on the stress <b>singularity</b> line in three-dimensional joints using a three-dimen-sional BEM with a fundamental solution for two-phase materials and an eigen analysis based on FEM. A 3 -ple root and a 5 -ple root of eigen value, p= 1, occur at the vertex and a point on the <b>singularity</b> line, respectively. The variation of stress distribution in a cylindrical coordinate system concerned with a point on the singular line with a distance from the vertex is examined using BEM. The order of stress <b>singularity</b> deduced from the stress distribution is compared with that deduced from the eigen analysis. The slope of the stress distribution reduced the logarithmic <b>singularity</b> terms was fairly agreed with the order of stress <b>singularity</b> calculated by the eigen analysis. It was shown that the order of stress <b>singularity</b> at the vertex was larger than that at the point on the stress <b>singularity</b> line, and the effect of logarithmic <b>singularity</b> along the <b>singularity</b> line on the stress distribution is larger than that at vertex. The value of coefficient in a power-law <b>singularity</b> in-creased as approaching to the vertex along the <b>singularity</b> line.
