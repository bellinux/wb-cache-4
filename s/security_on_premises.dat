40|$|Unified {{communications}} as {{a service}} (UCaaS) {{can be regarded as}} a cost-effective model for on-demand delivery of unified communications services in the cloud. However, addressing security concerns has been seen as the biggest challenge to the adoption of IT services in the cloud. This study set up a cloud system via VMware suite to emulate hosting unified communications (UC), the integration of two or more real time communication systems, services in the cloud in a laboratory environment. An Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) gateway was also set up to support network-level security for UCaaS against possible security exposures. This study was aimed at analysis of an implementation of UCaaS over IPSec and evaluation of the latency of encrypted UC traffic while protecting that traffic. Our test results show no latency while IPSec is implemented with a G. 711 audio codec. However, the performance of the G. 722 audio codec with an IPSec implementation affects the overall performance of the UC server. These results give technical advice and guidance to those involved in security controls in UC <b>security</b> <b>on</b> <b>premises</b> {{as well as in the}} cloud...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{argues that}} as the Philippines grew more {{dependent}} on labor migration, the state attempts to achieve human security for migrants through an institutionalized set of policies and assumptions. The promise of migrant welfare and human <b>security</b> is <b>premised</b> <b>on</b> the following points: creating better policies and institutionalizing migrant state agencies, creating national laws together with bilateral and multilateral agreements on migration, and in recent years, the promotion of migration and development initiatives. While these attempts may hold promise, they suffer from limitations on their implementation and sustainability. In the final analysis, human security can only be achieved by working towards creating a national dialogue on migration: where stakeholders from the state, civil society organizations, and migrant groups participate in the national debate regarding the future of migration. Through a national dialogue that aims to foster participation towards consensus, it is only then that responsive and long-term policies grounded in human security can go beyond the view that migration and development policies are a catch-all panacea {{to the problems of}} migrant protection and long-term economic development in the homeland.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{an approach}} to physical-layer <b>security</b> based <b>on</b> the <b>premise</b> that the coding mechanism for secrecy over noisy channels is fundamentally tied {{to the notion of}} resolvability. Instead of considering capacity-based constructions, which associate to each message a sub-code whose rate approaches the capacity of the eavesdropper’s channel, we consider resolvability-based constructions, which associate to each message a sub-code whose rate is beyond the resolvability of the eavesdropper’s channel. We provide evidence that resolvability is a more powerful and perhaps more fundamental coding mechanism for secrecy by developing results that hold for strong secrecy metrics and arbitrary channels. Specifically, we show that, at least for binary symmetric wiretap channels, random capacity-based constructions fail to approach the strong secrecy capacity while resolvability-based constructions achieve it. We then obtain the secrecy-capacity region of arbitrary broadcast channels with confidential messages and a cost constraint for strong secrecy metrics, which generalizes existing results. Finally, we specialize our results to study the secrecy capacity of wireless channels with perfect channel state information, compound and mixed channels, as well as the secret-key capacity of source models for secret-key agreement. By tying secrecy to resolvability, we obtain achievable rates for stronger secrecy metrics and with simpler proofs than previously derived.

40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War {{expanded}} the reach of international institutions and brought to the fore the possibility of achieving a Kantian Peace. Through a mixture of coercion and consent, the contemporary liberal peace project has endeavored to spread democracy, the rule of law, human rights, global economic integration, free markets and neo-liberal reforms, {{in an attempt to}} secure global peace. It contains different interpretations that include emancipatory, orthodox and conservative tendencies. Emancipatory model of liberal peace Based on custodianship, consent and local ownership, the emancipatory model adopts a bottom-up approach to peace-building and security. It seeks to challenge the traditional power relations between the global North and South, prioritizing social justice across the economic, political, cultural and security spectrum. This model has given rise to the human security paradigm. A rights-based response to the "new security threats " of poverty, economic inequality, pandemic diseases, human rights abuses, environmental degradation, and natural disasters has emerged within the emancipatory model of the liberal peace.
