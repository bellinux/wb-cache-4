40|$|Abstract- Text {{clustering}} extends over {{wide range}} of applications from information retrieval system, pattern recognition, search engines to social networks, and other digital collections. Text data involved in such applications usually have ample of unused data associated with them. The paper focuses on handling this unused data, referred as <b>supplementary</b> <b>information,</b> to generate effective clusters. The <b>supplementary</b> <b>information</b> may include document provenance information, links in a document, index terms used within a document or any other data that is not generally used for clustering. In this paper, we perform document clustering using <b>supplementary</b> <b>information</b> along with the content for generating clusters with higher purity. We also identify {{the use of such}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>information</b> for clustering in applications involving other file types like audio, image, video, etc. The clustering performance may degrade if the <b>supplementary</b> <b>information</b> associated with pure content is noisy. Taking this into consideration, we use partitioning-based clustering algorithm and a probabilistic model. We present experimental result to justify the approach...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Most blood donors stop {{donating}} {{blood at}} the beginning of their donor career. This intervention study aims to increase first-time return behaviour of newly registered donors using implementation intentions and explicit commitment techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Newly registered donors (N = 937) received an extra <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> during their medical check-up wherein implementation intentions and explicit commitment techniques were tested. Donors were randomly assigned to either the control condition, <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> only condition, <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with implementation intentions condition, <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with explicit commitment condition, or <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with both implementation intentions and explicit commitment condition. Logistic regression analyses examined actual first-time return behaviour after an appeal to donate blood. RESULTS: Donors in the <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with both implementation intentions and explicit commitment condition had an 11 · 5 % higher return rate than donors in the control condition. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the <b>information</b> <b>sheet</b> with both implementation intentions and explicit commitment condition significantly increased the odds on return behaviour compared with the control condition (OR = 1 · 65, 95 %CI = 1 · 08 - 2 · 50). CONCLUSION: This study successfully increased actual first-time return behaviour of newly registered donors by using both implementation intentions and explicit commitment techniques...|$|R
