40|$|For many {{preclinical}} studies, {{the mouse}} {{has been an}} invaluable model. For hepatic studies, including gene therapy, {{the use of the}} mouse has been limited because of the inability to obtain long-term portal vein access. In this study, we have developed a <b>surgical</b> <b>cannula</b> model that allows for repeat portal vein infusion in a noninvasive manner. We have used this model to establish that the tissue distribution of recombinant adenoviral vectors is similar after portal vein or peripheral vein infusion. The majority of the vector was present in the liver, ranging from 14 to 28 copies per hepatocyte. The second most prevalent tissues were the spleen and lung with 1 / 10 less adenoviral DNA. The brain and ovaries had the least DNA, 1 / 1000 less than the liver. Additional studies were performed to study the effects of secondary adenovirus infusion through the portal vein cannula. Permanent portal vein access in a mouse model will be invaluable for a large number of medical studies, including the development of new technologies for hepatic gene transfer...|$|E
40|$|Multi-phase {{post-mortem}} {{computed tomography}} angiography (MPMCTA) {{is a new}} diagnostic tool, used in forensic pathology. On the one hand, this technique allows a better and direct visualization of vascular and solid organ lesions. On the other hand, the invasiveness of the procedure-which requires surgical denudation (inguinal and/or cervical) and the insertion of surgical cannulas-leads to many relatives refusing scientific autopsies. Our hypothesis states that a minimally-invasive procedure combining interventional radiological techniques with MPMCTA (replacement of surgical cannulas by radiological catheters) will improve the approval rate of scientific autopsies by families. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the feasibility of the minimally-invasive MPMCTA approach and to compare its performance to the current reference-standard (the conventional approach). We included consecutively 16 corpses divided in two groups according to the contrast enhancement approach: radiological catheters (n= 8), and surgical cannulas (n= 8). Corpses were chosen and assigned randomly from our local data. The quality of the imaging procedure was compared according to four items: global vascular opacification, cerebral venous opacification, and lower limbs opacification (arterial and venous). A minimally-invasive approach for scientific autopsies is feasible through a radiological catheter. Vascular opacification was optimal in 8 out of 8 cases and was no less effective than the control reference group using <b>surgical</b> <b>cannula</b> incision associated with their non-occlusive aspects...|$|E

Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation is now a mature technology, but the role of expandable cages is still evolving. The capability to deliver a multiexpandable interbody cage with a large footprint through a narrow <b>surgical</b> <b>cannula</b> represents a significant advancement in spinal surgery technology. The purpose of this report is to describe a multiexpandable lumbar interbody fusion cage, including implant characteristics, intended use, surgical technique, preclinical testing, and early clinical experience. Results to date suggest that the multiexpandable cage allows a less invasive approach to posterior/transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion surgery by minimizing iatrogenic risks associated with static or vertically expanding interbody prostheses while providing immediate vertebral height restoration, restoration of anatomic alignment, and excellent early-term clinical results.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was to trace the {{historical}} origin of the inserted cannula during tracheotomy. Tracheotomy is mentioned in most ancient medical texts, but the origin of cannula insertion into the windpipe is unclear. We reviewed the incunabula and Renaissance texts reporting the utilization of <b>surgical</b> <b>cannulas</b> and tracheotomy. The incunabula disclosed extended use of <b>surgical</b> <b>cannulas</b> during the middle ages and Renaissance. Although tracheotomy was advocated in acutely suffocating patients for a disease of the throat termed squinantia or angina, the first report of the procedure was found only {{at the end of the}} middle ages and a second during the middle Renaissance. The introduction of cannula use in tracheotomy was supported by a semantic misinterpretation by Antonio Musa Brasavola. The historical origin for tracheotomy in the middle ages and Renaissance is conflicting. Antonio Brasavola wrongly interpreted Avicenna's oral cannula introduced into the windpipe for angina. This misinterpretation allowed Giulio Casserio to draw the first curved cannula introduced for used during tracheotomy...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: To test validity, safety, {{costs and}} healing-outcome of <b>surgical</b> minitracheotomy after <b>cannula</b> removing. METHODS: Design: Opened, perspective. Site: Polyvalent ICU. Patients: 40 {{patients}} underwent surgical minitracheotomy, in a year. Traditional surgical technique was adopted. Minitracheotomy {{was performed by}} intravenous general anesthesia with curarization and in mechanical ventilation. Intra-operative monitoring: ECG, non-invasive blood pressure and SaO 2 by digital pulse oximetry. If a bleeding appeared, hemorrhage was stopped by vessel binding. RESULTS: Technical difficulty was the same in every tracheotomy carried out. Complications appeared in 7 patients. There were 2 infectious cases for stoma, resolved in 7 and 12 days respectively by local disinfection and antibiotic therapy. There were 5 cases with moderate bleeding; in one patient only a surgical procedure was necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical tracheotomy represents a good and safe method in ICU; complications are few, if safety conditions are observed. Tracheotomy made in ICU reduced the use of medical and paramedical staff and operative rooms; unlike percutaneous procedure, in the surgical technique an always the same set after simple sterilization is used. Healing-outcome of <b>surgical</b> tracheotomy, after <b>cannula</b> removing, is the same with both techniques...|$|R
40|$|Background The use of Macrolane™ {{seems to}} have several {{advantages}} {{compared to the other}} standard methods for breast augmentation: it is faster, less invasive, and requires only local anesthesia. Nevertheless, various complications {{associated with the use of}} Macrolane™ have been described, e. g., encapsulated lumps in breast tissue, infection, and parenchymal fibrosis. We report the results of our case series study on the clinical and imaging evaluations of patients who came to our attention after breast augmentation with Macrolane™ injection and evaluate the effect of this treatment on breast cancer screening procedures. Methods Between September 2009 and July 2010, seven patients, treated elsewhere with intramammary Macrolane™ injection for cosmetic purposes, presented to our institution complaining of breast pain. In all patients, Macrolane™ had been injected under local anesthesia in the retromammary space through a <b>surgical</b> <b>cannula.</b> Results On mammography, nodules appeared as gross lobulated radiopacities with polycyclic contours. On breast ultrasound, the nodules showed hypo-anaechogenic cystlike features. In all cases, image analysis by the radiologist was hindered by the presence of the implanted substance, which did not allow the complete inspection of the whole breast tissue. Conclusions From our experience, although safe in other areas, injection of Macrolane™ into breast tissue cannot be recommended at this time. Our study, along with other reports, supports the need to start a clinical trial on the use of injectable fillers in the breast to validate their safety and effectiveness. </br...|$|E
40|$|Many <b>surgical</b> {{procedures}} use <b>cannulas,</b> guidewires, and catheters in {{the treatment}} of life threatening conditions (e. g. cardiac tamponade and tension pneumothorax), or for diagnosis (e. g. diagnostic peritoneal lavage). Simulator development is costly in time and resources. Most computer-based trainers are procedure-specific. Each trainer uses a different hardware configuration. The cost of using multiple simulators for teaching is prohibitive. A result is decreased acceptance of simulation for teaching. A generalized software architecture has been developed that simplifies the process of constructing trainers for needle-based surgical procedures. Different procedures can use the same hardware platform. The architecture has been used to develop two trauma simulators. A third simulator is currently being developed using this architecture. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction: Tracheostomy is a {{procedure}} that can be performed in any age group, including children under 1 year of age. Unfortunately health professionals in Brazil have great difficulty dealing with this condition {{due to the lack}} of standard care orientation. Objective: This clinical consensus by Academia Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia Pediátrica (ABOPe) and Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria (SBP) aims to generate national recommendations on the care concerning tracheostomized children. Methods: A group of experts experienced in pediatric tracheostomy (otorhinolaryngologists, intensive care pediatricians, endoscopists, and pediatric pulmonologists) were selected, taking into account the different regions of Brazil and following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: The results generated from this document were based on the agreement of the majority of participants regarding the indications, type of <b>cannula,</b> <b>surgical</b> techniques, care, and general guidelines and decannulation. Conclusion: These guidelines can be used as directives for a wide range of health professionals across the country that deal with tracheostomized children...|$|R
50|$|Each of the {{individual}} products in the catalogue has been developed {{over the course of}} time, beginning in 1997. That year saw the start of manufacturing and distributing the company’s own brands of Comfort, Santex, and Proster medical gloves. Then, in 2012, the available product line was expanded with the inclusion of surgical draping sets and specialised surgical sheets. This period of time saw the introduction of Comfort PF and DermaGel powder-free examination gloves with low latex content, and Vinylex vinyl medical examination gloves, constituting the first alternative to latex gloves in Poland. In 2005, the company began cooperation with Ansell Healthcare in the scope of distribution. In that same year, the product line was expanded with the inclusion of Orthopeg, Microtex, Gynoglove, and Syntec NEOPRENE specialist surgical gloves, as well as Texident gloves designed for dentists, gloves designed for procedures involving increased risk of infection, ProHand sterile examination gloves, and powder-free vinyl gloves. The decision to purchase the medical gloves production plant in Thailand resulted in the introduction of a new group of products, i.e. dressings that included the following: gauze compresses, non-woven fabric compresses, high-absorbency compresses, adhesive tapes on various types of carriers, dressings for the fastening of <b>cannula,</b> <b>surgical</b> dressings, plaster bandages, stabilising supports, and net bandages.|$|R
40|$|Background & aim: Angiotensin II plays a {{key role}} in body fluid homeostasis. In the present study, the {{interaction}} of i. c. v. injection of morphine, heroin and losartan’s material, opioidergic and angiotensinergic systems on water intake in male rabbits were investigated. Methods: In the present experimental study, sixty-five male rabbits were divided into eight groups as follows: a control group without operation, control with <b>surgical</b> accompanying with <b>cannula,</b> the control surgery and cannulated with a saline injection, morphine (at doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg rabbit kg), heroin group (2. 5, 5 and 10 mg/kg rabbit), losartan group (45, 90 and 180 mg kg rabbit), losartan (90 mg/kg rabbit) with morphine (5 / 10 kg rabbit), losartan (90 mg kg) and heroin (2. 5 and 5 mg kg rabbits) were received. A cannula was used to ICV treatment in the right lateral ventricle of rabbits. After recovering the animals were deprived of water for 24 hours. The different drugs injected and the amount of drinking water was measured for one hour was measured. The gathered data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey test. Result: The results showed that Morphine (agonist of opioid’s receptor, 10 µg/rabbit), Heroin (agonist of opioid’s receptor, 5 µg/rabbit), Losartan (antagonist of Angiotensin II receptor, 90 µg/rabbit) decreased water intake. Blockade of Angiotensin II with losartan, attenuate the inhibitory effect of Morphin and Heroin. Renin- Angiotensin System can regulate water intake via its effect on vasoconstriction and secretion of AVP and Aldestrone. All of these effects will be blocked with Angiotensin II antagonist (losartan). Conclusion: The Opioidergic system was influential in the adjustment of water and electrolyte balance through affecting peripheral and central receptors. The role of the Opioidergic system in regulation of drinking mechanisms was related to the secretion of Antiduretic hormone. According to the obtained results, a marked correlation was seen between angiogenesis systems, Opioidergic system and morphine (opioid) on water intake...|$|R
