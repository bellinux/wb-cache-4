6000|$|Ten {{days after}} that {{performance}} of her private undertaking Adela began to sniff, as it were, {{a difference in the}} general air; but as yet she was afraid to exult. It wasn't in truth a difference for the better, so that there might be still a great tension. Her father, since the announcement of his intended marriage, had been visibly pleased with himself, but that pleasure now appeared to have undergone a check. She had the impression known to the passengers on a great steamer when, {{in the middle of the}} night, they feel the engines stop. As this impression may easily <b>sharpen</b> <b>to</b> the sense that something serious has happened, so the girl asked herself what had actually occurred. She had expected something serious; but it was as if she couldn't keep still in her cabin--she wanted to go up and see. On the 20th, just before breakfast, her maid brought her a message from her brother. Mr. Godfrey would be obliged if she would speak to him in his room. She went straight up to him, dreading to find him ill, broken down on the eve of his formidable week. This was not the case however--he rather seemed already at work, to have been at work since dawn. But he was very white and his eyes had a strange and new expression. Her beautiful young brother looked older; he looked haggard and hard. He met her there as if he had been waiting for her, and he said at once: [...] "Please tell me this, Adela--what was the purpose of your visit the other morning to Mrs. Churchley, the day I met you at her door?" ...|$|E

50|$|The {{substance}} on the sharpening surface must {{be harder}} (hardness is measured on the Mohs scale) than the material being sharpened; diamond is extremely hard, making diamond dust very effective for sharpening, though expensive; less costly, but less hard, abrasives are available, such as synthetic and natural Japanese waterstones. Several cutlery manufacturers now offer electric knife sharpeners with multiple stages {{with at least}} one grinding stage. These electric sharpeners are typically used in the kitchen but have the ability to sharpen blades such as pocket or tactical knives. The main benefit of using an electric sharpener is speed with many models that can complete the sharpening process in one to two minutes. The disadvantage is that the sharpening angle is fixed so some specialized knives, like a Japanese style Santoku, may need additional attention to <b>sharpen</b> <b>to</b> the ideal angle.|$|E
50|$|Diamond stones can {{be useful}} in the {{sharpening}} process. Diamond is the hardest naturally occurring substance known and as such can be used to sharpen almost any material. (Coarse diamond sharpening stones can be used for flattening waterstones.) Alternatively, tungsten carbide blades can be used in knife sharpening. Clamp-style sharpening tools use a clamp with several holes with predefined angles. The stone is mounted on a rod and is pulled through these holes, so that the angle remains consistent. Another system is the crock stick setup, where two sticks are put into a plastic or wooden base to form a V shape. When the knife is pulled up the V, the angle is held so long as the blade is held perpendicular to the base.

5000|$|Many {{critics and}} even {{personal}} acquaintances failed to grasp Wollstonecraft's fundamental point, that Maria's [...] "wrongs" [...] are political, not personal. She wrote to one {{friend who had}} criticized it:I am vexed and surprised at your not thinking the situation of Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of - shall I say it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting {{that you are a}} man - For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as I have described, for life - obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should <b>sharpen</b> <b>to</b> agony the pangs of disappointment.Even Godwin, her husband, complained, [...] "I do not want a common-place story of a brutal, insensible husband." [...] Both the Anti-Jacobin Review and the Monthly Review reviewed the novel harshly. The Anti-Jacobin Review, attacking both Wollstonecraft and her book as well as Godwin's Political Justice and Memoirs, wrote:The restrictions upon adultery constitute, in Maria's opinion, A MOST FLAGRANT WRONG TO WOMEN. Such is the moral tendency of this work, such are the lessons which may be learned from the writings of Mrs. Wollstonecraft; such the advantages which the public may derive from this performance given to the world by Godwin, celebrated by him, and perfectly consonant to the principles of his Political Justice.—But as there have been writers, who have in theory promulgated opinions subversive of morality, yet in their conduct have not been immoral, Godwin has laboured to inform the world, that the theory of Mrs. Wollstonecraft was reduced to practice; that she lived and acted, as she wrote and taught.in original: We could point out some of this lady's pupils, (emphasis in original)Under the heading [...] "Prostitution" [...] in the index to the magazine, the editors listed only one entry: Mary Wollstonecraft.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 76 - 77) Early in {{his college}} career, Stephen Crane discovered that "humanity {{was a more}} interesting study" than the "cut-and-dried curriculum. " It was not that he disliked books; he preferred watching people. He would, in fact, spend {{the remainder of his}} short life doing just that. The purpose of this thesis is to explore the changes in Stephen Crane's interpretation of his favorite subject, man. His western tour provided him with the occasions which altered his viewpoint concerning man in his world. Stephen Crane's first opportunity to study man away from the confines of the city was during his tour west in 1895. While travelling alone across the prairies and deserts Crane was able to adjust his viewpoint concerning several subjects. The experiences he had altered prior convictions. Crane's early writings display an attitude towards man as being steered through his life, helpless to freely choose because of the oppressive nature of society. Man in his world was at the mercy of others and lived defensively. However, Crane changed this depressing outlook when he went to Mexico and lived a kind of freedom he had never known before. Chapter one, entitled, "The Individual in Society," traces the change in Crane and his new direction of thought. In Chapter Two the study of man in his world continues with a shift in focus from the individual in society to the predicaments a person willfully gets himself involved in. "Motivations and Predicaments" shows that, after divorcing himself from the idea that society governed a man's life, Crane enjoyed showing the follies of man. The problems of man in his world are not brought on by society but by his own misconceptions and motivations prompted by a set of values. Chapter Three, "Nature and Man" explores Crane's altered concept of the role nature played in influencing man in his world. Well versed in Emerson's ideas of nature as a religion, Crane, on his trip west, saw and felt another side of the elements. Man, Crane found out, is of no use to nature. In fact, if anything, he is a pest to the whole planet. In conclusion, Chapter Four, "The Responses of Man" considers Crane's lifelong study of emotions. From childhood fears Crane developed his talent for transforming fear-related sensations. In early works, terror was described in a dream-like, fantastic way. After Crane experienced genuine terror in escaping from Mexican bandits, his presentation of fear found new expression. Throughout his life, both before and after his western trip, Stephen Crane's foremost quest was to <b>sharpen,</b> <b>to</b> clarify his understanding of that creature, man. In November, 1895, upon his return to the East, Crane wrote that true culture was "a comprehension of the man at one's shoulder. " Especially in the West, Crane had had an opportunity to study a variety of people and substantially increase his knowledge and comprehension of his favorite subject. He may even by November, 1895 have believed he had attained true culture as opposed to superficial notions. For not only did Crane learn to comprehend man better in his world {{as a result of his}} western exposure but he could go on to present him in his various absurd or tragic or mysterious moments for his readers in the future...|$|E

50|$|Very sharp knives sharpen {{at about}} 10 dps (degrees per side) (which {{implies that the}} knife's edge has an {{included}} angle of 20-degrees). Generally speaking, razors, paring knives, and fillet knives should be the sharpest knives at an angle of 12° - 18°. Most kitchen knives, like utility/slicing knives, chef’s knives, boning knives, carving knives, should be <b>sharpened</b> <b>to</b> 15° - 25°. The exceptions are Japanese style knives that are usually <b>sharpened</b> <b>to</b> 14° - 16° depending on the knife maker. Japanese style knives utilize a much harder steel, {{and are therefore more}} brittle than their Western style counterparts. This means care should be taken when handling these knives as they are susceptible to chipping and breaking. The sporting knife category, including pocket knives, survival knives, and hunting knives, sees more intense action and should be <b>sharpened</b> <b>to</b> the 25° - 30° angle range. The less sharp angle means there is more metal there to cut, thus providing more durability out in the field. For an extremely durable edge, a machete, chisel, drawknife or ax should be <b>sharpened</b> down <b>to</b> 30° - 40° providing even more ruggedness and longer lasting sharpness.|$|R
