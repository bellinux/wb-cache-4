60|$|MANGAN. You <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> {{the lot of}} you. I want no company, {{especially}} female company.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do?" [...] said Martin; [...] "why, {{what should}} you do--but just wish Mr Daly good morning, and <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> snug and comfortable?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shouldn't be surprised. Anyhow, you <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> Go {{to sleep}} and dream that you're playing for the school against Ripton. So long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You very, very foolish Englishwoman," [...] she said. [...] "A hand {{leaned down}} from Heaven, and you liked better to <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> but I am glad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say so," [...] replied Radbourn, {{his eyes}} kindling. [...] "Say so, {{and get out}} of it. There's nothing worse than <b>staying</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> What have <b>you</b> saved from the general land-slide?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have,' {{said the}} stranger. 'And if I {{did not hold}} you in a {{particular}} esteem, I should make no words about the matter. It appears you pride yourself on <b>staying</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>You</b> mean to stick by your inn. Now I mean you shall come for a turn with me in my barouche; and before this bottle's empty, so you shall.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no; <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> You are charmingly grouped, {{and appear}} to {{uncommon}} advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] Mr. Van Reinberg assented, [...] "but the fact's {{there all}} the same. I guess you can <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> Mr. Courage!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was some}} one passing," [...] she said. [...] "I don't {{understand}} why. They {{all came to}} bed some time ago. <b>Stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> and don't move." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{the devil}} {{do you mean}} by coming here?" [...] I cried. [...] "Did I not write <b>you</b> to <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>were?</b> How did <b>you</b> get here?" [...] I stepped down on the {{banquette}} and seized him by the shoulders. [...] "Did you receive my letter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the master, sir Mr. Putney, and his daughter. Just <b>stay</b> here <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> sir, {{and make}} {{yourself}} comfortable. I'll go {{and speak to}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you come}} any closer," [...] one warned him, flourishing his club with the {{advertisement}} of braining him. [...] "You <b>stay</b> right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> until <b>you</b> get your orders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a bit, Doctor. <b>Stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> I am lost {{without my}} Boswell. And this {{promises}} to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bad conscience," [...] he acknowledged. [...] "I've been {{where you}} have been--Miss Grimes. I looked over the edge and I jumped. I'd <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> if I were you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'The boy 'ad got it,' he ses. 'Now shall I {{open the}} door and let your missis in, or would you rather <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in peace and quietness?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then said Bai-Jove-Judson, {{who was a}} linguist: [...] "You <b>stay</b> o <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> o, or I'll leave a hole-o in {{your bottom}} o {{that will make you}} much os perforatados." ...|$|R
6000|$|Happy Jack laughed. [...] "You're {{welcome to}} {{stay as long as}} you like, Unc' Billy," [...] he said. [...] "You better <b>stay</b> right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> and I'll go tell old Mrs. Possum <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>stay</b> right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> Henry, {{and make}} {{yourself}} comfortable," [...] said Gif. [...] "As long as you're {{willing to do}} your share of the work around here, you shall have your share of whatever there is to eat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{turn about}} {{and you can}} see {{perfectly}} well, but <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> till he comes back," [...] commanded Thorny, as signs of commotion appeared in the excited audience.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can call}} it what you like," [...] she said. [...] "In any case you will never receive any {{different}} sort of answer from me. <b>Stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> Mr. Ennison." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is one {{advantage}} about this horrid place," [...] he said; [...] "we have {{got it all}} to ourselves. <b>Stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> Betteredge; I {{have something to say}} to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no {{need for}} you to rush," [...] drawled the man, much as if he enjoyed keeping the boys in suspense, [...] "for if <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>you</b> will see them. They've got to come back this way, sure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> may <b>stay</b> right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> {{and take}} care of my daughter. If she wants to climb {{mountains}} or shoot rapids, it's to be done; but you'll fix things so it can be done safely. You're in charge of this outfit, and not that major man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "you {{all come}} up {{asking the same}} {{question}} and wasting my time answering you all severally. You {{want to know what}} this place means. Well, if you'll <b>stay</b> just <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> for a minute, I'll tell you all together, and save time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'd {{better go}} downstairs," [...] said Jane. [...] "Bring the candle. Not you, Eustace darling. You <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{or you may}} catch a chill. Don't stir out of bed!" ...|$|E
60|$|THE BOYS [barring {{the way to}} the door] You <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> Stop a bit, stop a bit. Dont you be in such a hurry. Dont let him go. Not much.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay {{where you}} are, coward! {{are you afraid}} of dead men {{standing}} against walls? <b>Stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> Ah! here is the chisel--now let us see {{what you can do with}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, youse," [...] he shouted, [...] "get further back, you're in the picture. Or, say, no, <b>stay</b> right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> You," [...] he said, {{pointing}} to me, [...] "stay right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> and I'll {{give you a}} dollar to just hold that horror; you understand, just keep on registering it. Don't do another thing, just register that face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>stay</b> here, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> I ask it as a {{favor to}} me. You need not go to the school to-morrow--indeed, you cannot. But stay here {{for a day or two}} at least, and if there is any justice left in a free country, we shall have it. Will you stay, {{as a favor}} to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Leland sharply; [...] "you'll <b>stay</b> just <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{until the}} morning, {{though you can}} take your {{blankets}} into the other room as soon as you like. It's quite hard to keep my hands off you, and if you come out before I call you to make breakfast, I'm not going to try." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said firmly, [...] "you can {{do nothing}} further. You have done your part and done it well. <b>Stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> and wait. The rest belongs to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you believe}} that perhaps you had best <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> till the Khania wearies of Yellow-beard and opens the gates for you," [...] he replied, eyeing me with his cunning glance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>stay</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> and be damned," [...] {{retorted}} Marmaduke, {{turning on}} his heel and walking toward the house. In the hall he met a maid carrying an empty champagne bottle and goblet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, don't, then; <b>stay</b> {{right there}} <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> Oh-um!" [...] gaped Hartley, {{stretching}} himself; [...] "it's about time f'r breakfast, I guess. Want y'r hands washed and y'r hair combed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Sally Steel, {{for it was}} my neighbor's sister, {{shouted to}} {{somebody}} through the window, {{and then turned to}} the man who rose from a corner. [...] "You just <b>stay</b> right <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> When I call cookie I'll see he comes. I've been running this place as it ought to <b>be</b> run, and <b>you</b> won't know Gaspard's when you get about, Rancher Ormesby." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Steve's {{letting her}} go," [...] said the surveyor, {{who came out}} from the car. [...] "Got to rush her through for the side-track ahead of the west-bound mail. Say, the light <b>is</b> growing; <b>stay</b> just <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> for {{presently}} there'll be unrolled the most gorgeous panorama that ever delighted a sinful mortal's eye, and you'll see {{the first of what}} some day is going to be of all lands on this wide green earth the greatest country." ...|$|R
