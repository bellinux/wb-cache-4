2500|$|In {{parabolic}} antennas, {{virtually all}} the power radiated is concentrated in a narrow main lobe along the antenna's axis. [...] The residual power is radiated in sidelobes, usually much smaller, in other directions. [...] Because in parabolic antennas the reflector aperture is {{much larger than the}} wavelength, due to diffraction there are usually many narrow sidelobes, so the sidelobe pattern is complex. [...] There is also usually a backlobe, in the opposite direction to the main lobe, due to the <b>spillover</b> <b>radiation</b> from the feed antenna that misses the reflector.|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” For {{an active}} {{beamforming}} array, standard definitions for efficiencies and system temperature are not available. We use noise considerations to generalize the single-antenna conventions for aperture efficiency, <b>spillover</b> efficiency, <b>radiation</b> efficiency, and system temperature to arrays. The treatment {{leads to a}} new noise matching efficiency that quantifies the effect of mutual coupling on amplifier noise. Numerical results for a phased array feed indicate that the noise increase caused by mutual coupling can be significant. I...|$|R
