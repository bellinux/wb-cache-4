40|$|Degenerative {{meniscus}} lesions typically {{involve a}} horizontal cleavage of the meniscus, as result of slowly developing changes of mucoid degeneration and <b>sheer</b> <b>stresses</b> to the meniscus. Typically, these injuries {{are not a}} result of acute knee trauma. These lesions are tremendously common to asymptomatic people despite {{they can also be}} implicated in persistent pain and/or mechanical symptoms. They are found incidentally in about every third knee in the general population after the age of 50, and their prevalence further increases with age. The degenerative meniscus lesions have been implicated in increased risk of meniscus radial displacement and deformation, resulting in increased hyaline cartilage contact stresses. In essence degenerative meniscus lesions should be clearly distinguished from traumatic meniscal tears due to their different etiologies, high prevalence, and strong association with degenerative joint disease including several degrees of osteoarthritis...|$|E
30|$|A {{keystone}} in {{the implementation}} of the classic Ilizarov technique over some conventional techniques of fracture fixation is early functional loading of the limb as distinct to early functional use. A considerable body of literature attests to the importance of functional loading (weight bearing) in promoting fracture healing; by minimising the size of the fracture gap and reducing torsional and <b>sheer</b> <b>stresses</b> while allowing small amounts of axial strain, physiological loading of the bone in the immediate post-operative period can significantly reduce the time taken for healing to occur and reduce the incidence of delayed or non-union [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Early loading also preserves muscle tone, proprioceptive sensation and gait, thereby optimising rehabilitation. Follow-up studies of patients who have had leg-lengthening procedures show that the recovery of knee range of movement is excellent in the long term, although patients with congenital leg length discrepancies tend to do slightly worse [14, 15].|$|E
30|$|In {{this study}} the waste {{polyethylene}} were degraded by thermal hydropyrolytic process. The degradation process mainly follows {{the mechanism of}} chain scissions which is generally caused by increase in temperature and <b>sheer</b> <b>stress</b> in twin-skew extruders and hence decreases the molecular weight. Cross linking or chain branching have opposite effect to chain scission and are caused mainly by low <b>sheer</b> <b>stress</b> and high residence time in a single skew extruders. A concurrence occurs between the molecular enlargement by chain branching and the decrease of molecular weight by chain scission. The thermal degradation of the polymers occurs by breaking C–C or C–H bonds. Degradation depends on the nature such as polar groups and structure, for example head-to-head or tail-to-tail weak linkages, double bonds or branching points of the polymeric chain, on the ingredients in the polymer resin and {{on the type of}} the external stress.|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} one-step {{process to}} synthesize highly porous (Ca-alginate–SiO 2 –polycation) shell: (Na-alginate– SiO 2) core hybrid beads for cell encapsulation, yielding a reusable long-life photosynthetically active {{material for a}} sustainable manufacture of high-value metabolites is presented. Bead formation is based on crosslinking of an alginate biopolymer and mineralisation of silicic acid in combination with a coacervation process between a polycation and the silica sol, forming a semi-permeable external membrane. The excellent mechanical strength and durability of the monodispersed beads and the control of their porosity and textural properties is achieved by tailoring the silica and alginate loading, polycation concentration and incubation time during coacervation. This process {{has led to the}} formation of a remarkably robust hybrid material that confers exceptional protection to live cells against <b>sheer</b> <b>stresses</b> and contamination in a diverse range of applications. Dunaliella tertiolecta encapsulated within this hybrid core–shell system display high photosynthetic activity over a long duration (> 1 year). This sustainable biotechnology could find use in high value chemical harvests and biofuel cells to photosynthetic solar cells (energy transformation, electricity production, water splitting technologies). Furthermore the material can be engineered into various forms from spheres to variable thickness films, broadening its potential applications. 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Supercritical fluids offer a {{considerable}} promise as a processing media {{for the formation}} of microparticles of drugs and pharmaceutical excipients. There are two main reasons for using this technique. Firstly, the selective solvating power of supercritical fluids makes it possible to separate a particular component from a multi-component mixture. Secondly, the favourable mass transfer properties and high solubility of solvent in supercritical fluid make the formation of the microparticles rapid and efficient. Supercritical fluids also offer various other advantages such as use of organic solvents, high temperatures, high <b>sheer</b> <b>stresses</b> can be avoided which can therefore aid in the effective, safe and green processing of APIs and pharmaceutical excipients. Solubility behaviour of supercritical fluid can be altered or tuned by the fine adjustment of pressure and temperature. Supercritical fluids can also be utilised as a solute and can help in the depression of melting point or glass transition temperature of an excipient, allowing microparticle production at far lower temperatures. The processing of excipients and APIs with supercritical CO 2 and utilisation of this approach in the development of novel drug delivery systems (NDDS) is an attractive proposition because of above mentioned advantages. Our group is particularly interested in the "safe" formulation of NDDS for biologics for oral delivery which also entails incorporation of bio-molecules and proteins into inorganic host materials. Immobilisation of biologics on a solid surface improves their thermal and chemical stability. These biologics on an inorganic host can then be safely coated with lipids and/or other suitable excipient using supercritical fluid processing. This approach can provide sustained, targeted and safe passage to a drug to the lower intestine where it can be released and absorbed...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} variations in ferrule shape given by the core placed, on stresses developed in the root. Methods: Six 3 D models of a maxillary second premolar were made according to the mean dimensions obtained in the literature. A masticatory load (291. 36 N) was simulated with result parallel to the long axis of the tooth. In four models, {{the size of the}} plate (E) was varied: 1 / 3 of the root wall thickness (E 1) or 2 / 3 (E 2). The height (A) of the bevel was equivalent to E 1 (A 1) or E 2 (A 2), that is: ferrule E 1 A 1 and E 2 A 2 with an inclination of 45 º. One model represented a healthy tooth, another model simulated the core only, with plate, without ferrule (E 2 A 0). All the cases had the same coronal restoration. All the structures were considered homogenous, isotropic and linear elastic. The increase in the height of the recess (from E 2 A 1 to E 2 A 2 or from E 1 A 1 to E 1 A 2) caused changes in the compressive <b>sheer</b> <b>stresses</b> in the root dentin over the recess. Results: The best results were obtained by model E 1 A 2, which minimized the sheer/ stresses in the cervical root dentin and in the root dentin close to the periodontal ligament, followed by models E 1 A 1, E 2 A 1 and E 2 A 2. Conclusion: To distribute the stress on the root dentin on the plate in the best possible manner, it is imperative to have the ferrule. The ferrule protects the root dentin under the plate (the higher the better) and the inclination of 45 o results in a more efficient protective effect for the dentin over plate...|$|E

This relationship is a balance between the <b>sheer</b> <b>stress</b> exerted on the clast and the normal pressure on the clast by a body of ice. Plucking is increased where there are preexisting fractures in a rock bed. As the glacier slides down a mountain, energy from friction, pressure or geothermal heat causes glacial meltwater to infiltrate the spaces between rocks. This process, known as frost wedging, puts stress on the rock structure as water expands when it freezes. Impacts from large clasts carried in the bedload can cause additional stress to the bedrock. [...] Additionally, plucking {{can be seen as a}} positive feedback system in which the increased action of rock removed from the landscape entrained in the glacier causes larger scale fracturing further down the glacier because of a heavier load of force pushing down on the rock bed.|$|R
40|$|The {{survival}} of premature infants is critically {{dependent on their}} state of lung maturation. Immature lungs often fail to facilitate lung aeration and gas exchange after birth and they often require respiratory assistance with a mechanical ventilator [1, 2].

Our primary aim was to therefore to identify ventilation strategies that promote uniform lung aeration at relatively low airway pressures and that prevent lung collapse. We have previously demonstrated that a single sustained inflation (SI) provided for the initial breath, fully inflates the lung and reduces lung collapse [3, 4].

50|$|Nitric oxide {{signalling}} {{has also}} been shown {{to play a role in}} haemogenic endothelial cell production and activation, possibly by regulating the expression of Runx1. The <b>sheer</b> <b>stress</b> from blood flow activates mechanoreceptors in the blood vessel to produce NO, making NO production circulation dependent. This is seen in Ncx1 knockouts, where the failure to develop a heartbeat, and consequent lack of circulation results in a down-regulation of Runx1 and no haematopoietic activity in the AGM. When Ncx1 knockouts are supplied with an external source of NO, haematopoietic activity in the AGM returns to near wild-type levels. This isolates NO signalling as the key factor controlling haematopoiesis, and not just the presence of circulation. However the signalling cascade linking NO to Runx1 expression is yet to be elucidated. NO signalling {{has also been}} shown to control the motility of endothelial cells by regulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1. This makes it likely that it is involved in the budding of haemogenic endothelial cells into circulation. As Runx1 is also crucial for haemogenic endothelial cell activation, it is possible that NO regulates both of these downstream effects.|$|R

However, the first-generation HBOCs led to systemic and pulmonary hypertension with decreased cardiac output, myocardial damage, and other effects, such as NO scavenging, oxidative stress, and hyperoxia. Second-generation HBOCs are currently undergoing active investigation. These agents seem better tolerated and resulted in fewer complications related to NO depletion. Conjugation of hemoglobin with polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a potentially promising agent. PEGylation increases viscosity, which induces a greater endothelial <b>sheer</b> <b>stress</b> and local NO production with a concomitant increase in functional capillary density [43]. Moreover, PEGylation can increase the oncotic pressure and promote intravascular volume expansion.

Exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to NO donors caused an increase in phosphorylation of both Thr- 172 of AMPK and Ser- 1177 of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, a downstream enzyme of AMPK. NO-induced activation of AMPK was not affected by inhibition of LKB 1, an AMPK kinase. In contrast, inhibition of calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase abolished the effect of NO in HUVECs. NO-induced AMPK activation in HeLa S 3 cells was abolished by either 1 H-(1, 2, 4) -oxadiazole[4, 3 -a]quinoxalon- 1 -one, a potent inhibitor for guanylyl cyclase, or 1, 2 -bis(2 -aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis (acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM), an intracellular Ca 2 + chelator, indicating that NO-induced AMPK activation is guanylyl cyclase-mediated and calcium-dependent. Exposure of HUVECs or isolated mice aortas to either calcium ionophore A 23187 or bradykinin significantly increased AMPK Thr- 172 phosphorylation, which was abolished by N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase.

Taken together, we conclude that NO might act as an endogenous AMPK activator...|$|R
40|$|Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) {{is a novel}} Ca 2 + mobilizing second messenger, {{which is}} capable of {{inducing}} Ca 2 + release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via activation of ryanodine receptors (RyR) in vascular cells. This signaling nucleotide has also been reported to participate in generation or modulation of intracellular Ca 2 + sparks, Ca 2 + waves or oscillations, Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release (CICR) and spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). With respect {{to the role of}} cADPR-mediated signaling in mediation of vascular responses to different stimuli, there is accu-mulating evidence showing that cADPR is importantly involved in the Ca 2 + response of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and VSMCs to various chemical factors such as vasoactive agonists acetylcholine, oxotremorine, endothelin, and physical stimuli such as stretch, electrical depolarization and <b>sheer</b> <b>stress.</b> This cADPR-RyR-mediated Ca 2 + signaling is now recognized as a fundamental mechanism regulating vascular function. Here we reviewed the literature regarding this cADPR signaling path-way in vascular cells with a major focus on the production of cADPR and its physiological roles in the control of vascular tone and vasomotor response. We also summarized some publish results that unveil the underlying mechanisms mediating the actions of cADPR in vascular cells. Given the importance of Ca 2 + in the regulation of vascular function, the results summa-rized in this brief review will provide new insights into vascular physiology and circulatory regulation...|$|R
40|$|Flow {{mediated}} dilatation {{is a tool}} {{widely used}} to measure arterial responsiveness to <b>sheer</b> <b>stress.</b> However, there is scant literature {{to show how the}} peripheral arterial response changes as the vascular system mature. One {{reason for this is that}} the feasibility of measuring flow mediated dilatation in younger children has not been established. The aim of this study was to assess brachial artery function at rest and during flow mediated dilatation response after 4 minutes of ischemia of the forearm in children aged 6 - 15 years. Time to reach flow mediated dilatation maximum was found to correlate with age (r = 0. 4, p < 0. 05), resting brachial artery diameter (r = 0. 4, p < 0. 05), height (r = 0. 4, p < 0. 05), BMI (r = 0. 45, p < 0. 05), body surface area (r = 0. 44, p < 0. 05) and resting blood flow (r = 0. 37, p < 0. 05). However, no correlation between the traditional flow mediated dilatation response at 60 s and for flow mediated dilatation maximal dilation was evident with age, resting brachial artery diameter, height, weight, BMI, body surface area, resting blood flow. In conclusion, the time taken to reach maximal dilation response is related to age and brachial artery luminal diameter and body habitus but not the traditional measures: FMD response at 60 s or the maximal dilatation percentage.

40|$|Thrombin {{has been}} {{reported}} to elicit two temporally different effects on neutrophil-endothelial interac-tion, categorically described as 'neutrophil ad-hesion': one expressed within a few minutes, the other after several hours of endothelial preincu-bation. Prolonged activation resulted in often elongated, tightly interacting neutrophils in contact with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE) mainly at the intercellular region. In contrast, the neutrophil-endothelial interaction due to short-time priming with thrombin was dominated by round, randomly distributed neutrophils, loosely adhering on the endothelial surface. <b>Sheer</b> <b>stress,</b> introduced to characterize these morphological entities in a quantitative manner, clearly defined the neutrophil response due to short time priming as sheer stress-labile compared to the sheer stress-resistant interac-tion expressed after prolonged preincubation of HUVE with thrombin. Quantitative determination of neutrophil transendothelial migration served to demonstrate the relevance of such differences in neutrophil binding with respect to subsequent layer penetration. Dependent upon endothelial protein synthesis and inhibited by antithrombin-III-heparin and hirudin, neutrophil layer penetration only oc-curred after prolonged activation of HUVE whereas the neutrophil-endothelial interaction due to short time priming with thrombin was limited to super-ficial neutrophil adhesion. We conclude that thrombin can be added to the list of activators capable of inducing the neutrophil passage-guiding principle, an effect that has recently been detected as closely related to neutrophil ad-hesion to endothelial ligands expressed upon acti-vation with interleukin- 1 and tumor necrosis factor. This biological activity, which can be separated from superficial attachment of polymorphonuclear leuko-cytes (PMN) to endothelial cells, is a catalytic site-dependent and late phase-specific effect of thrombin on HUVE...|$|R
