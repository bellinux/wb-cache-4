5|$|The {{establishment}} of insect life provided <b>some</b> <b>food</b> for birds, and birds in turn helped many species to become established on the island. The bodies of dead birds provide sustenance for carnivorous insects, while the fertilisation {{of the soil}} and resulting promotion of plant life provides a viable habitat for herbivorous insects.|$|E
5|$|The first troops reached Madang on 8 February, and {{the whole}} {{movement}} was complete by 23 February. Eighteenth Army anticipated that units reaching Madang, would probably have lost much of their equipment, as was indeed the case, so stores were gathered together from distant Wewak and Hansa, and collected together near Madang. In addition emergency articles such as <b>some</b> <b>food,</b> shoes and clothing were collected {{near the mouth of}} the Minderi River, supplied by the Nakai Detachment.|$|E

5|$|Red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} are diurnal, raucous and noisy, and {{are often}} seen flying high overhead in small flocks, sometimes mixed with other cockatoos. Flocks of up to 500birds are generally only seen in the north or when the birds are concentrated at <b>some</b> <b>food</b> source. Otherwise, they are generally rather shy of humans. In northern and central Australia, birds may feed on the ground, while the two southern subspecies, graptogyne and naso, are almost exclusively arboreal. They tend to fly rather slowly with intermittent deep flapping wingbeats, markedly different from the shallow wingbeats of the similar glossy black cockatoo. They also often fly at considerable height.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor prepares <b>some</b> <b>food</b> and blindfolds The Man. He leads The Man to {{a part of}} the {{hospital}} where a woman is kept, and gives her the food. The Brute sets fire to the front door of {{the hospital}}, though The Doctor and The Man extinguish the flames. The Man and The Doctor go to bring food to the woman again, and The Man gives her a wrapped gift. They then catch The Brute attempting to saw through the iron bar gate, though are able to scare him off.|$|E
5|$|With {{few other}} options {{available}} to him, the President of the Assembly, Jean Joseph Mounier, accompanied a deputation of market-women into the palace to see the king. A group of six women nominated by the crowd were escorted into the king's apartment, where they told him of the crowd's privations. The king responded sympathetically, and using all his charm impressed the women {{to the point that}} one of them fainted at his feet. After this brief but pleasant meeting, arrangements were made to disburse <b>some</b> <b>food</b> from the royal stores, with more promised, and some in the crowd felt that their goals had been satisfactorily met. As rain once again began to pelt Versailles, Maillard and a small cluster of market women trooped triumphantly back to Paris.|$|E

5|$|In season 3, Sophie {{was mostly}} only {{mentioned}} in the starting episodes of the third season. She was a frequent babysitter, often left with Flower' pups, Buster, Izzy and Suggs, along with Mitch and Jogu. When the Whiskers moved territories, Izzy fell behind and {{was expected to be}} killed by an eagle owl, but Sophie rescued the pup. Later, Sophie once again came to Izzy's aid and offered <b>some</b> <b>food.</b> When the babysitters (Sophie, Mitch and Jogu) and the pups were separated from the Whiskers, Mitch, being the oldest, left to find the main group to try and reunite them with the pups. Soon after a Zappa female named Maryline visited the burrow looking for her family. Following his hormones, Jogu went off after the evicted female, leaving Sophie to watch Flower's pups by herself. When the rival gang, the Zappa, attacked, Sophie took the pups below ground. But before the Zappa reached the burrow, the Whiskers arrived and chased them off. After these events, Sophie was seldom mentioned again throughout the season. At one point in the third season, she was played by Finn because Tina Sparkle was evicted.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} loanwords for food dishes and their {{ingredients}} are Hokkien in origin, {{and are used}} throughout the Indonesian language and vernacular speech of large cities. Because they have {{become an integral part}} of the local language, many Indonesians and ethnic Chinese do not recognize their Hokkien origins. Some popular Indonesian dishes such as nasi goreng, lumpia, and bakpia can trace their origin to Chinese influence. <b>Some</b> <b>food</b> and ingredients are part of the daily diet of both the indigenous and ethnic Chinese populations as side dishes to accompany rice, the staple food of most of the country. Among ethnic Chinese families, both peranakan and totok, pork is generally preferred as meat; this is in contrast with traditional Indonesian cuisine, which in majority-Muslim areas avoids the meat. The consumption of pork has, however, decreased in recent years owing to a recognition of its contribution to health hazards such as high cholesterol levels and heart disease.|$|E
5|$|The Shaktisamgama-tantra narrates {{the birth}} of Ucchishta-matangini. Once, the god Vishnu and his wife Lakshmi visited Shiva and his second wife Parvati (a reincarnation of Sati) and gave them a banquet of fine foods. While eating, the deities dropped <b>some</b> <b>food</b> on the ground, from which arose a {{beautiful}} maiden who asked their left-overs. The four deities granted her their left-overs as prasad, food made sacred by having been first consumed by the deity. This {{can be interpreted as}} the Ucchishta of the deity, although due to its negative connotation the word Ucchishta is never explicitly used in connection to prasad. Shiva decreed that those who repeat her mantra and worship her will have their material desires satisfied and gain control over foes, declaring her the giver of boons. From that day, the maiden was known as Ucchishta-matangini.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} religious rite for Heathens is called blót, which constitutes a ritual in which offerings are {{provided to the}} gods. Blót typically takes place outdoors, and usually consists of an offering of mead, which is contained within a bowl. The gods are invoked and requests expressed for their aid, as the priest uses a sprig or branch of an evergreen tree to sprinkle mead onto both statues of the deities and the assembled participants. This procedure might be scripted or largely improvised. Finally, the bowl of mead is poured onto a fire, or onto the earth, as a final libation to the gods. Sometimes, a communal meal is held afterward; in some groups this is incorporated {{as part of the}} ritual itself. In other instances, the blót is simpler and less ritualized; in this case, it can involve a practitioner setting <b>some</b> <b>food</b> aside, sometimes without words, for either gods or wights. Some Heathens perform such rituals on a daily basis, although for others it is a more occasional performance. Aside from honoring deities, communal blóts also serve as a form of group bonding.|$|E
