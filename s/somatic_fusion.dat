Both names, however, will probably {{be found in the}} literature for some time. Two of the major reasons that some still consider the genera separate are the leaf structure (tomato leaves are markedly different from any other Solanum), and the biochemistry (many of the alkaloids common to other Solanum species are conspicuously absent in the tomato).

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{potential for}} <b>somatic</b> <b>fusion</b> among different conspecific multicellular individuals suggests that such fusion is adaptive. However, because recognition of non-kin (allorecognition) usually {{leads to a}} rejection response, successful <b>somatic</b> <b>fusion</b> is limited to close kin. This is consistent with kin-selection theory, which predicts that the potential cost of fusion {{and the potential for}} somatic parasitism decrease with increasing relatedness. Paradoxically, however, Crozier[1] found that, in the short term, positive-frequency-dependent selection eliminates the required genetic polymorphism at allorecognition loci. The Crozier paradox may be solved if allorecognition is based on extrinsically balanced polymorphisms, for example at immune loci. Alternatively, the assumption of most models that self fusion is mutually beneficial is wrong. If fusion is on average harmful, selection will promote unconditional rejection. However, we propose that fusion within individuals is beneficial, selecting for the ability to fuse, but fusion between individuals on average costly, selecting for non-self recognition (rather than non-kin recognition...|$|E

Additional cell types such as trophoblasts and osteoclasts also require <b>somatic</b> cell <b>fusion</b> events to perform their physio-logical functions. Currently we have rudimentary knowledge on molecular mechanisms regulating <b>somatic</b> cell <b>fusion</b> events in mammals. We therefore investigated during in vitro murine myogenesis a mammalian homolog, Kirrel, of the Drosophila Melanogaster genes Roughest (Rst) and Kin of Irre (Kirre) which regulate <b>somatic</b> muscle cell <b>fusion</b> during embryonic development.

Protein expression levels of Kirrel B are inverse to the occurrence of cell fusion events during in vitro myogenesis which is {{in stark contrast to the}} expression profile of Rst and Kirre during myogenesis in Drosophila. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of cell fusion confirmed the inverse expression pattern of Kirrel B protein levels in relation to cell fusion events.

40|$|<b>Somatic</b> cell <b>fusion</b> is {{essential}} for the in vivo function of skeletal muscle, osteoclasts and trophoblasts. A diverse range of additional tissues including brain, heart, liver, prostate and intestinal epithelium are also subject to <b>somatic</b> cell <b>fusion</b> events in vivo. Fusion of embryonic stem cells has been reported and it has been hypothesised that fusion of cancer cells with macrophages may enable metastases. Furthermore, <b>somatic</b> cell <b>fusion</b> of Dystrophin positive cells with Dystrophin negative muscle cells may be therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of muscular dystrophy. In Drosophila, the type 1 transmembrane proteins Kin of Irre (Kirre), Roughest (Rst), Hibris and Sticks and Stones (SnS) are involved in regulating the muscle cell fusion process during larval development. The mammalian orthologues of Kirre and Rst include: Kirrel, Kirrel 2 and Kirrel 3 while Nephrin is the mammalian orthologue to Hibris and SnS. It is currently unclear whether the Kirrel family and Nephrin are expressed in mammalian skeletal muscle cells and whether they regulate the cell fusion process in these cells, {{as is the case in}} Drosophila. It was therefore hypothesised that all Kirrel family members and Nephrin would be temporally expressed in mammalian skeletal muscle cells as they undergo cell fusion events and hence may regulate the <b>somatic</b> cell <b>fusion</b> process. It was further hypothesised that inhibition of fusion would alter their expression patterns. Presented within this thesis are novel findings regarding the detection and expression profiling of all Kirrel family members and Nephrin during in vitro myogenesis of the C 2 C 12 murine skeletal muscle cell line. Previously unreported splice variants of Kirrel and Kirrel 3 have also been identified in C 2 C 12 cells and in additional murine tissues. Variable expression patterns among family members are reported. The presence of multiple Kirrel family members and Nephrin in C 2 C 12 cells suggest that redundancy and/or compensatory mechanisms are in place, as is the case in Drosophila, with regards mammalian muscle cell fusion in vivo. Results presented within this thesis lay the foundations for improving understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning mammalian <b>somatic</b> cell <b>fusion</b> events during development, injury repair and hypertrophy and also may enable increased efficacy of cellular therapies for diseases such as muscular dystrophy and the prevention of cancer metastasis.

40|$|With a view {{to assess}} the {{possibility}} of homoeologous pairing and crossing-over between the chromosomes of potato (Solanum tuberosum) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), a <b>somatic</b> <b>fusion</b> hybrid and two monosomic alien tomato addition genotypes were investigated through genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH). The <b>somatic</b> <b>fusion</b> hybrid, C 31 - 17 - 51, was near hexaploid (2 n = 6 x - 4 = 68) possessing 46 potato chromosomes + 20 tomato chromosomes + 2 translocated chromosomes. The two alien addition genotypes were near tetraploids (2 n = 4 x + 1 = 49) and consisted of monosomic alien additions for tomato chromosome 1 in genotype 2103 - 1, and tomato chromosome 8 in genotype 2301 - 2. In the fusion hybrid the tomato pachytene chromosome identification revealed that the chromosomes 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 12 were in diploid condition whereas among those that were in haploid condition, three could be identified viz., 4, 9, and 11. The remaining three chromosomes could not be cytologically identified. Although the chromosomes with translocated segments could not be identified at the pachytene stage due to technical difficulties, there was clear evidence {{for the presence of}} a reciprocal translocation observed at diakinesis and metaphase I stages. Because of autosyndetic pairing of the translocated segments, it gave a false impression as if there was a high frequency (86. 0 %) of allosyndetic pairing. In contrast to the fusion hybrid, the two alien monosomic addition genotypes showed a very low frequency of allosyndetic pairing, namely 1. 1 and 1. 3 % respectively for the monosomic additions 1 and 8. In the genotype 2301 - 2, monosomic addition for tomato chromosome 8, crossing-over between the homoeologous chromosomes was estimated to occur in 0. 8 % of the meiotic cells investigated. Despite this low frequency of homoeologous pairing and crossing-over, there is a possibility for introgressing tomato chromosomal DNA into the potato genome through intergenomic recombination...|$|E
40|$|In colonial marine {{invertebrates}}, allorecognition restricts <b>somatic</b> <b>fusion</b> and thus, chimerism, to histocompatible individuals.

We here evaded natural allorecognition barriers by generating well mixed embryonic chimeras of Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus (Cnidaria:Hydrozoa) and developed molecular markers to detect chimerism in both histocompatible and histoincompatible settings. Histocompatible chimeras exhibited markedly higher growth rates and survivorship than histoincompatible pairings. Histoincompatible chimeras were unstable, with chimerism being undetectable by 4 wk of age. In contrast, colonies generated from histocompatible pairings remained chimeric at markedly higher frequencies and longer durations.

Aggression is often costly, with contestants suffering injury and losing space for attachment and growth. Similarly, intraspecific <b>somatic</b> <b>fusion</b> in many sponges, cnidarians, bryozoans, and ascidians is limited to interactions between close relatives and is thought to carry substantial fitness costs.

40|$|The {{natural history}} of epiphytic plant species has been {{extensively}} studied. However, {{little is known about}} the physiology and genetics of epiphytism. This is due to difficulties associated with growing epiphytic plants and the lack of tools for genomics studies and genetic manipulations. In this study, tubers were generated from 223 accessions of 42 wild potato Solanum species, including the epiphytic species S. morelliforme and its sister species S. clarum. Lyophilized samples were analyzed for 12 minerals using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Mineral levels in tubers of S. morelliforme and S. clarum were among the highest for 10 out of the 12 elements evaluated. These two wild potato relatives are native to southern Mexico and Central America and live as epiphytes or in epiphytic-like conditions. We propose the use of S. morelliforme and S. clarum as model organisms for the study of mineral uptake efficiency. They have a short life cycle, can be propagated vegetatively via tubers or cuttings, and can be easily grown in controlled environments. In addition, genome sequence data are available for potato.

40|$|<b>Somatic</b> cell <b>fusion</b> {{is common}} during {{organogenesis}} in multicellular eukaryotes, although the molecular mechanism of cell fusion is poorly understood. In filamentous fungi, <b>somatic</b> cell <b>fusion</b> occurs during vegetative growth. Filamentous fungi grow as multinucleate hyphal tubes that undergo frequent hyphal fusion (anastomosis) during colony expansion, {{resulting in the}} formation of a hyphal network. The molecular mechanism of the hyphal fusion process and the role of networked hyphae in the growth and development of these organisms are unexplored questions. We use the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa as a model to study the molecular mechanism of hyphal fusion. In this study, we identified a deletion mutant that was restricted in its ability to undergo both self-hyphal fusion and fusion with a different individual to form a heterokaryon. This deletion mutant displayed pleiotropic defects, including shortened aerial hyphae, altered conidiation pattern, female sterility, slow growth rate, lack of hyphal fusion, and suppression of vegetative incompatibility. Complementation with a single open reading frame (ORF) within the deletion region in this mutant restored near wild-type growth rates, female fertility, aerial hyphae formation, and hyphal fusion, but not vegetative incompatibility and wild-type conidiation pattern. This ORF, which we named ham- 2 (for hyphal anastomosis), encodes a putative transmembrane protein that is highly conserved, but of unknown function among eukaryotes...|$|R

40|$|Self-recognition systems {{preventing}} chimera formation following <b>somatic</b> <b>fusion</b> {{between members}} of the same species have evolved only in certain phyla (e. g., fungi, cnidarians, poriferans, bryozoans, urochordates). We present here some of the biological features common to fungi and colonial marine invertebrates, which may have driven the evolution of such self-recognition systems. We conclude that the evolution of self-recognition mechanisms in fusible organisms is more likely to result from a complex trade-off between selection pressures linked with a gregariousness and sessile way of life. This trade-off also raises the question of how extrinsic interactions between a group of cooperative cells and its direct environment may have driven the evolution towards a form of individuality, via the emergence self-recognition systems in fusible organisms. Gregariousness and sessility being two features intrinsically associated emergence of multicellularity, somatic incompatibility systems could then be considered {{as one of the first}} expressions of individuality in early multicellular organisms...|$|E

Since the inception of hybridoma technology, efforts to improve efficiency and stability of monoclonal antibody-producing cell lines have not brought about substantial progress. Moreover, suitable human multiple myeloma-derived cell lines {{for the production of}} human antibodies have been very difficult to develop. Here we report a strategy that greatly simplifies the generation of antibodies and eliminates the need for hybridomas. We show that splenocytes derived from transgenic mice harboring a mutant temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large tumor antigen under the control of a mouse major histocompatibility promoter are conditionally immortal at permissive temperatures and produce monoclonal antibodies. This simple approach may become a method of choice for generation and production of both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies with advantages in high-throughput discovery and antibody-based immunotherapy...|$|E
40|$|The {{replication}} and {{segregation of}} multi-copy mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are not under strict {{control of the}} nuclear DNA. Within-cell selection may thus favour variants with an intracellular selective advantage but a detrimental effect on cell fitness. High relatedness among the mtDNA variants of an individual is predicted to disfavour such deleterious selfish genetic elements, but experimental evidence for this hypothesis is scarce. We studied the effect of mtDNA relatedness on the opportunities for suppressive mtDNA variants in the fungus Neurospora carrying the mitochondrial mutator plasmid pKALILO. During growth, this plasmid integrates into the mitochondrial genome, generating suppressive mtDNA variants. These mtDNA variants gradually replace the wild-type mtDNA, ultimately culminating in growth arrest and death. We show that regular sequestration of mtDNA variation is required for effective selection against suppressive mtDNA variants. First, bottlenecks {{in the number of}} mtDNA copies from which a 'Kalilo' culture started significantly increased the maximum lifespan and variation in lifespan among cultures. Second, restrictions to <b>somatic</b> <b>fusion</b> among fungal individuals, either by using anastomosis-deficient mutants or by generating allotype diversity, prevented the accumulation of suppressive mtDNA variants.

40|$|SummaryReprogramming of nuclei {{allows the}} {{dedifferentiation}} of differentiated cells. Somatic cells can undergo epigenetic modifications and reprogramming through their fusion with {{embryonic stem cells}} (ESCs) or after overexpression of a specific blend of ESC transcription factor-encoding genes. We show here that cyclic activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in ESCs with Wnt 3 a or the glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK- 3) inhibitor 6 -bromoindirubin- 3 ′-oxime (BIO) strikingly enhances the ability of ESCs to reprogram <b>somatic</b> cells after <b>fusion.</b> In addition, we show that reprogramming is triggered by a dose-dependent accumulation of active β-catenin. Reprogrammed clones express ESC-specific genes, lose somatic differentiation markers, become demethylated on Oct 4 and Nanog CpG islands, and can differentiate into cardiomyocytes in vitro and generate teratomas in vivo. Our data thus demonstrate that in ESCs, periodic β-catenin accumulation via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway provides a specific threshold {{that leads to the}} reprogramming of <b>somatic</b> cells after <b>fusion...</b>|$|R

It suggested that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from protoplasts of embryogenic callus parent {{plays an important role}} in stimulating division and regeneration of mesophyll protoplasts. Herein, <b>somatic</b> <b>fusion</b> was conducted via electrofusion between callus protoplasts isolated from Valencia orange [Citrus sinensis (L.)

Two embryoids and one plantlet with GFP expression were successfully obtained and subsequent ploidy analysis by flow cytometry indicated that they were all diploids. The regenerated diploid embryoids and plantlet with GFP expression could be considered as ‘cybrids’ with mtDNA from the callus protoplasts of Valencia orange.

40|$|The {{presence}} of highly specific histocompatibility reactions in colonial marine invertebrates that lack adaptive immune systems (such as the sponges, cnidarians, bryozoans and ascidians) provides {{a unique opportunity}} to investigate the evolutionary roots of allorecognition and to explore whether homologous innate recognition systems exist in vertebrates. Conspecific interactions among adult animals in these groups are regulated by highly specific allorecognition systems that restrict <b>somatic</b> <b>fusion</b> to self or close kin. In Hydractinia (Cnidaria:Hydrozoa), fusion/rejection responses are controlled by two linked genetic loci. Alleles at each locus are co-dominantly inherited. Colonies fuse if they share at least one haplotype, reject if they share no haplotypes, and display transitory fusion if they share only one allele in a haplotype—a pattern that echoes natural killer cell responses in mice and humans. Allorecognition in Hydractinia and other marine invertebrates serves as a safeguard against stem cell or germline parasitism thus, limiting chimerism to closely related individuals. These animals fail to become tolerant even if exposed during early development to cells from a histoincompatible individual.

Three mt (coxII- 2, cob- 1, and cob- 2) and three cp HRM markers (trnL-trnF, trnL-trnF- 2, and ndhF- 1) were successfully developed.

In order to test this hypothesis, we compared abiotic stress tolerance between coalescing and non-coalescing organisms. The specific daily growth was compared using discs formed with 1, 5, and 20 Mazzaella laminarioides carpospores. These were cultivated under three different temperature (6, 12, and 25 degrees C) and salinity (10, 35, and 50 g L- 1) conditions. Growth of the disc area was measured after 30 days of cultivation under controlled conditions. Sporeling survival similarly was calculated under each of these temperatures and salinities in order to record whether stress-resistant phenotypes were present. The results showed that, under stressful conditions, non-coalescing specimens experienced {{a significant reduction in}} the specific growth rate compared with those under non-stressful conditions. The reduction in growth falls off, however, as the number of coalescing spores increases. The cultivation of spore populations also indicates the presence of sporelings with the capacity to survive alone in stressful situations. The results suggest that the coalescing discs exhibit higher tolerance to environmental stressors than non-coalescing discs, allowing them to survive and grow under these conditions. This can be explained by an increase in phenotypic plasticity, resulting from greater genetic heterogeneity due to <b>somatic</b> <b>fusion</b> of a larger number of spores.

40|$|Nucleotide {{excision}} repair (NER) -deficient human cells {{have been assigned}} so far to a genetic complementation group by a <b>somatic</b> cell <b>fusion</b> assay and, more recently, by microinjection of cloned DNA repair genes. We describe a new technique, based on the host cell reactivation assay, for the rapid determination of the complementation group of NER-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne's syndrome (CS) and photosensitive trichothiodystrophy (TTD) human cells by cotransfection of a UV-irradiated reporter plasmid with a second vector containing a cloned repair gene. Expression of the reporter gene, either chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or luciferase, reflects the DNA repair ability restored {{by the introduction of}} the appropriate repair gene. All genetically characterized XP, CS and TTD/XP-D cells tested failed to express the UV-irradiated reporter gene, this reflecting their NER deficiency whereas cotransfection with the repair plasmid expressing a gene specific for the given complementation group increased the enzyme activity to the level reached by normal cells. Selective recovery of both reporter enzyme activities was observed after cotransfection with the XPC gene for the XP 17 VI cells and with the XPA gene for both XP 18 VI and XP 19 VI cells. Using this method, we assigned three new NER-deficient human cells obtained from patients presenting clinical symptoms described as classical XP to either XP group A (XP 18 VI and XP 19 VI) and XP group C (XP 17 VI). Therefore, this technique increases the range of methods now available to determine the complementation group of new NER deficient patients with the advantage, unlike the <b>somatic</b> cell <b>fusion</b> assay or the microinjection procedure, of being simple, rapid, and inexpensive...|$|R
40|$|Themolecular {{mechanisms}} of membrane merger during <b>somatic</b> cell <b>fusion</b> in eukaryotic species are poorly understood. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, <b>somatic</b> cell <b>fusion</b> occurs between genetically identical germinated asexual spores (germlings) and between hyphae {{to form the}} interconnected network characteristic of a filamentous fungal colony. In N. crassa, two proteins have been identified to function at the step of membrane <b>fusion</b> during <b>somatic</b> cell fusion: PRM 1 and LFD- 1. The absence of either {{one of these two}} proteins results in an increase of germling pairs arrested during cell fusion with tightly ap-pressed plasmamembranes and an increase in the frequency of cell lysis of adhered germlings. The level of cell lysis inPrm 1 or lfd- 1 germlings is dependent on the extracellular calcium concentration. An available transcriptional profile data set was used to identify genes encoding predicted transmembrane proteins that showed reduced expression levels in germlings cultured in the absence of extracellular calcium. From these analyses, we identified a mutant (lfd- 2, for late fusion defect- 2) that showed a calcium-dependent cell lysis phenotype. lfd- 2 encodes a protein with a Fringe domain and showed endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membrane localization. The deletion of an additional gene predicted to encode a low-affinity calcium transporter, fig 1, also resulted in a strain that showed a calcium-dependent cell lysis phenotype. Genetic analyses showed that LFD- 2 and FIG 1 likely function in separate pathways to regulate aspects of membrane merger and repair during cell fusion.
