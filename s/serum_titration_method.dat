A series of titrations was carried out to validate the <b>titration</b> <b>method,</b> as per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. The <b>titration</b> <b>method</b> was used to analyse {{the stability of the}} UA suspensions stored for six weeks under ICH accelerated stability conditions.

40|$|Simple <b>titration</b> <b>methods</b> {{certainly}} deserve {{consideration for}} on-site routine monitoring of volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration and alkalinity during anaerobic digestion (AD), {{because of their}} simplicity, speed and cost-effectiveness. In this study, the 5 and 8 pH point <b>titration</b> <b>methods</b> for measuring the VFA concentration and carbonate system alkalinity (H 2 CO 3 *-alkalinity) were assessed and compared. For this purpose, synthetic solutions with known H 2 CO 3 *-alkalinity and VFA concentration as well as samples from anaerobic digesters treating three different kind of solid wastes were analysed. The results of these two related <b>titration</b> <b>methods</b> were verified with photometric and high-pressure liquid chromatography measurements. It was shown that photometric measurements lead to overestimations of the VFA concentration {{in the case of}} coloured samples. In contrast, the 5 pH point <b>titration</b> <b>method</b> provides an accurate estimation of the VFA concentration, clearly corresponding with the true value. Concerning the H 2 CO 3 *-alkalinity, the most accurate and precise estimations, showing very similar results for repeated measurements, were obtained using the 8 pH point titration. Overall, it was concluded that the 5 pH point <b>titration</b> <b>method</b> is the preferred method for the practical monitoring of AD of solid wastes due to its robustness, cost efficiency and user-friendliness...|$|R

40|$|The {{determination}} of ionic surfactants {{was carried out}} {{on the basis of}} ion association between ionic dyes and ionic surfactants in an aqueous medium. Three kinds of dyes (tetrabromophenolphthalein ethyl ester(TBPE), methyl orange analogues and nitrophenylazophenol analogues) were used as novel ion-association reagents. The ion-association constants between cationic surfactants (Q(+)) with dyes (D(-)) and anionic surfactants (A(-)) were obtained. It was found that the hydrophobic interaction {{plays an important role in}} the formation of stable ion associates. On the basis of the ion association accompanying a color change, the analytical methods for the {{determination of}} ionic surfactants, such as a batchwise spectrophotometric method, a flow-injection method and a photometric <b>titration</b> <b>method,</b> were developed in the presence of a small amount of nonionic surfactant in an aqueous medium. In particular, the photometric <b>titration</b> <b>method</b> was examined in detail.

Results We compared lentiviral vector <b>titration</b> <b>methods</b> that measure pg p 24 /ml, RNA equivalents/ml, transducing units (TU/ml) or mRNA equivalents. The amount of genomic RNA in vector particles proves to be reliable to assess the production quality of vectors encoding non-fluorescent proteins.
