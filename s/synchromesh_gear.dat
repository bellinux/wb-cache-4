50|$|The Isabella {{featured}} a swing axle at the back: it {{was supported by}} coil springs on all four wheels. The four-cylinder 1493 cc engine had a claimed power output of , and was connected {{by means of a}} then innovative hydraulic clutch to the four speed full <b>synchromesh</b> <b>gear</b> box. Gear changes were effected by means of a column mounted lever.|$|E
50|$|From August 1937 the 75 gun {{tanks of}} {{the second and third}} series were taken into production. The first five of these were only {{delivered}} between 3 and 5 May 1938, the next ten between 2 and 3 June. On 27 July 56 had been produced and 34 delivered. The penultimate delivery was on 21 November, the last vehicles were probably produced just before the end of 1938. The second and third batch incorporated the improvements made in 1937 on the first batch but also featured some unique modifications such as a <b>Synchromesh</b> <b>gear</b> box and reinforced chassis girders {{in the front of the}} vehicle to ensure a sufficient frame rigidity: a severe distortion had occurred on the earlier vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|... triple cone <b>synchromesh</b> on <b>gears</b> 2 and 3, up from double cone.|$|R
5000|$|Transmission {{of power}} to the front wheels was via a four speed manual {{transmission}} without <b>synchromesh.</b> [...] <b>Gear</b> changing used a column mounted lever.|$|R
5000|$|Both the Elf and the Hornet {{went through}} three engine versions. Initially, {{they used the}} [...] engine (engine type 8WR) with a single HS2 carburettor, {{changing}} to a single HS2 carburettor [...] version of the Cooper's [...] power unit (engine type 9WR) in the Mark II in 1963. This increased the car's top speed from 71 to 77 mph. Therefore, Mark II cars also came with increased braking power {{in the form of}} front drum brakes with twin leading shoes to cope with the increased power output. Both Mark I and Mark II featured four-speed gearboxes (three <b>synchromesh</b> <b>gears)</b> with rod gear change, a.k.a. [...] "magic wand" [...] type. Automatic gearboxes became available on the Mark II in 1965 as an option. The Mark III facelift of 1966 brought wind-up windows and fresh-air fascia vents. Concealed door hinges were introduced two years before these were seen on the mainstream Mini. The gear selecting mechanism was updated to the rod type, as seen on all later Mini type cars. Automatic gearboxes were available to the Mark III in 1967 again. Full-four <b>synchromesh</b> <b>gearing</b> was eventually introduced during 1968. 30,912 Riley Elfs and 28,455 Wolseley Hornets were built. Production of both models ceased in late 1969.|$|R
5000|$|Transmission: cable {{operated}} four-speed manual cast aluminum case transaxle with 2nd and 3rd <b>synchromesh,</b> transfer <b>gears</b> and second, {{third and fourth}} of [...] "herringbone" [...] design, column shift.|$|R
5000|$|The {{chromium-plated}} radiator shell was {{succeeded in}} August 1934 by a radiator cowl painted in body colour {{and the body}} given more modern wings with valances for better protection. The Harley was dropped for 1935.Sports variants were added in August 1933 with a lowered chassis and higher compression engine. A 4-seater sports tourer and a saloon named Greyhound. In 1936 another body named Kempton was available on the same chassis. These cars carry a distinctive radiator shell. The sports models shared the new illuminated semaphore direction indicators and <b>synchromesh</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
50|$|April 1969 - Spain: 4 <b>gear</b> <b>synchromesh</b> gearbox {{introduced}} to Authi range.|$|R
50|$|The Saab 96 and its {{station wagon}} sibling, the Saab 95, {{featured}} column mounted tranmsmission levers. The gearbox originally had three gears, the first unsynchronised. Later, a four-speed option, with <b>synchromesh</b> first <b>gear,</b> was offered and the three-speed was phased out.|$|R
50|$|The TREMEC TR-3450 is a 5-speed manual {{transmission}} for longitudinal engine {{rear wheel drive}} trucks. It includes one overdrive gear, a light-weight aluminum housing, multi-cone synchronizers on first and second <b>gear,</b> and a <b>synchromesh</b> reverse <b>gear.</b> It is manufactured by Transmission Technologies Corporation.|$|R
50|$|The front brakes became discs {{and from}} 1964 it gained a new gearbox with <b>synchromesh</b> on first <b>gear.</b> The {{optional}} Borg Warner automatic got a floor mounted selector lever.|$|R
5000|$|The TREMEC TR-3650 is a 5-speed manual {{transmission}} for longitudinal engine automobiles. It includes a 5th gear that functions as an overdrive gear, light-weight aluminum housings, a <b>synchromesh</b> reverse <b>gear,</b> and <b>synchromeshed</b> helical cut forward gears. It is manufactured by Transmission Technologies Corporation and is rated for [...] of torque. The loss in power transmission efficiency is rated at approximately 16% in 4th gear for a 2005-2010 Ford Mustang GT.|$|R
50|$|The {{clutch in}} the system was {{replaced}} by a powder ferromagnetic coupler, developed from a Smiths design. The transmission itself was a three-speed mechanical unit {{similar to that of the}} Dauphine, but from the beginning with <b>synchromesh</b> on all <b>gears</b> in this version.|$|R
5000|$|Also in October 1964, the Moss four-speed {{manual gearbox}} with no <b>synchromesh</b> on first <b>gear</b> was {{replaced}} with Jaguar's own all-synchromesh four-speed gearbox. Revised gear ratios improved acceleration and a more compact Laycock A-type overdrive unit was fitted (when the overdrive option was specified) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{troublesome}} {{manual gearbox}} was a four-speed unit with <b>synchromesh</b> on all <b>gears</b> except reverse and {{was derived from}} the Triumph Toledo unit, controlled by a floor-mounted lever. Automatic transmission was a conventional Borg Warner Type 35 3 Speed transmission and was offered at extra cost.|$|R
50|$|The car {{features}} on-board jacking and {{a one-shot}} chassis lubrication system, {{operated by a}} lever inside the driver's compartment. Independent front suspension by a coil spring-based system is complemented by a carryover semi-elliptical spring unit in the rear. The car has a 4-speed manual transmission with <b>synchromesh</b> on <b>gears</b> 2, 3 and 4. An overdrive gearbox was added in 1938,the ratio change being contained in the gearbox {{rather than in a}} separate unit. The car has 4-wheel servo-assisted brakes applied by cable (using a servo made under licence from Hispano-Suiza). The radiator shell is of Staybrite steel.|$|R
50|$|Debuting in 1992, the {{transmission}} {{was developed in}} tandem with the Zetec family of engines. The transmission is optimised for transferring larger levels of torque than the older iB-series unit used on the Fiesta and Escort models. Other features include the provision of equal length driveshafts (to combat torque steer) and <b>synchromesh</b> on reverse <b>gear.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A further {{series of}} codes were raised late in 1954, presumably to extend {{lightweight}} features {{to the rest}} of the range. They were all synchromesh, but Leyland had as standard removed synchromesh engagement from second gear, this only available as an option, due to excessive wear, which Leyland credited to driver-abuse. Halifax continued to specify <b>synchromesh</b> on second <b>gear,</b> presumably at higher cost: ...|$|R
50|$|The 15/60 was {{replaced}} by the Wolseley 16/60 in September 1961. For some buyers, the most important change was the availability of Borg Warner 35 automatic transmission. Buyers choosing the four-speed manual transmission version may have been disappointed to find that the 1961 16/60 still came without <b>synchromesh</b> on first <b>gear.</b> By this time all-synchromesh gear-boxes were the norm for most competitor vehicles in the UK.|$|R
50|$|The only {{significant}} update in the Roadster's production came in September 1948 for the 1949 models, when the 2088 cc Vanguard engine, transmission, and rear axle were fitted. A retrograde step was the fitting of a three-speed gearbox {{even though it}} now had <b>synchromesh</b> on bottom <b>gear.</b> Apart from minor modifications to the mounting points, the chassis, suspension and steering were unaltered. This later version of the Roadster was given the model designation TRA.|$|R
50|$|There was {{no longer}} a lower-output engine option; the {{convertible}} and hardtop versions shared the same 82 bhp engine with single Solex carburettor. A new rear styling was introduced with the fins largely removed. Automatic transmission with floor-mounted control became an option, but was unpopular. From autumn 1964 a new manual gearbox with <b>synchromesh</b> on first <b>gear</b> was adopted in line with its use in other Rootes cars. A total of 12,406 were made.|$|R
5000|$|The smaller model 5 Roto Hydramatic {{uses the}} same {{principles}} of operation as the model 10. It is 9 lb lighter and much shorter in length â€” a necessary design parameter considering its placement in compact cars. The model 5 {{is not related to}} the [...] "Dual Path Dynaflow" [...] transmission used in the Buick Special and Skylark models of 1961-1963. Buick's Dual Path was an air-cooled 2-speed unit with a planetary gearset inside the flywheel-mounted torque converter. The first Pontiac Tempests used {{a modified version of the}} Powerglide transaxle shared with the Chevrolet Corvair. But unlike the Corvairs, the TempesTorque was connected via a flexible drive shaft to an unconventional slant-4 (half of a 389 V-8) or an aluminum 215 c.i. V-8, which would be later sold to the Rover Group and be renamed the 3500 V-8.The smaller 61-05 as fitted to the Vauxhall Cresta was dubbed the [...] "smoothamatic from Luton" [...] in Cars Illustrated in Feb 1961 being quite taken with the overall refinement with the test car, also noting that full throttle starts could be made on slushy roads, perhaps giving away the rather tall 1st gear and minimal torque conversion. They also stated that the gearshifts were so smooth as to be practically imperceptible. The magazine The Motor, Dec 1960, also praised the high standard of smoothness with very lively performance. The performance was claimed to be almost as fast as with <b>synchromesh</b> <b>gears</b> and the 2-3 shift could be so gradual in gentle driving that the driver did not always realise it has happened. Certainly, the examples the author drove were equal to this and it seemed disappointing when the 61-05 model was discontinued in favour of the Powerglide in 1965.|$|R
50|$|The Bantam re-used many {{existing}} components {{from the}} production line. It used the Le Mans' underslung chassis and 972 cc overhead cam engine, although {{with a lower}} compression ratio and single Solex carburettor. Power transmission was through a three-speed manual gearbox with <b>synchromesh</b> on third <b>gear.</b> Early models were equipped with wire wheels, while the optional easyclene wheels became standard from 1937. A chromed mascot portraying a flying Bantam chicken was mounted on the radiator surround until this was outlawed by new legislation in 1937.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the MG, the 15/50 engine {{had only}} a single SU {{carburettor}} so the power output was slightly less at [...] at 4400 rpm. Unlike the 4/44, the 15/50 had a floor gear change. From 1956 a [...] "Manumatic" [...] two pedal (centrifugal clutch) transmission was an option. This was controlled by a micro switch hidden in the gear lever operating a vacuum servo. Having no <b>synchromesh</b> on bottom <b>gear</b> could make changes into the lowest ratio, which would normally require double declutching, difficult.|$|R
50|$|Anglia saloons were {{provided}} with various levels of trim. The base model was the Standard, and this sported no chromework, painted rear light surrounds, steel slatted grille and limited interior trim. The deluxe had a chrome side strip, chrome rear lights, glovebox lid, sun visor and full width chrome radiator grille. The {{top of the range}} was the Super, which had twin chrome side strips, contrasting coloured roof and side flash, plusher interior trim, together with the 1198 cc engine and a gearbox with <b>synchromesh</b> on first <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The second 400 GT, {{commonly}} known as the 400 GT 2+2, had a different roofline, and minor sheetmetal changes compared to the 350 GT and first 400 GT. It was first presented at the 1966 Geneva Auto Show. The larger body shape enabled the +2 seating to be installed in the rear, where the 350 GT only had room for luggage or +1 seating. The bodywork was designed by Carrozzeria Touring. The 400 GT 2+2 also had a Lamborghini designed gearbox, with Porsche style <b>synchromesh</b> on all <b>gears,</b> which greatly improved the drivetrain. When leaving the factory the 400 GT originally fitted Pirelli Cinturato 205VR15 tyres (CN72).|$|R
50|$|The Y60 was radically {{different}} mechanically from its predecessors {{as it was}} the first patrol with coil sprung suspension, increasing comfort and rough ground handling. All Y60 patrols had a three-link live axle suspension set-up at the front, with all wagons (SWB and LWB) adopting a five-link set-up at the rear. The utility model was available with both a leaf spring rear axle and from 1994 onwards a choice of the same coil-spring rear axle as the wagons. Sway bars were included on both front and rear coil-sprung live axles. Power steering was standard. Some wagon models had front and rear disc brakes while the ute retained rear drum brakes. The introduction of a <b>synchromesh</b> on reverse <b>gear</b> was another improvement.|$|R
50|$|The SB {{launched}} at the October 1933 London Motor Show {{had a new}} cruciform braced chassis, {{slightly longer}} at 124 in, with independent front suspension using a single transverse leaf spring with a long solid anchorage in the centre. Steering was improved using new designs employed for racing Alvis cars since 1925. Road shocks were not transmitted from one wheel to the other nor did they affect {{the steering wheel and}} the gyroscopic effect was eliminated. Rear springs damped by Hartford Telecontrol dampers are long and underslung. The engine remained the same but the new all-silent gearbox, the first of its type, gained <b>synchromesh</b> on bottom <b>gear</b> and was mounted separately from the engine. A built-in jacking system was fitted as standard.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to {{complaints about the}} low performance of the 144 cid engine, a 170 cid straight-6 with a single-barrel Holley carburetor producing [...] at 4400 rpm was released for the 1961 model year. A new 4-speed manual transmission was also an option (a Dagenham without 1st <b>gear</b> <b>synchromesh).</b> The changes to the 1961 Comet were minimal such as moving the Comet Script from the front fender to the rear quarter {{as well as a}} new grille design. The optional S-22 package was released. Available only on the 2-door sedan, it was billed as a [...] "sport" [...] package, although it shared the same mechanicals as regular Comets, with the only changes being S-22 badging, bucket seats and a center console.|$|R
5000|$|The gearbox {{had five}} ratios with <b>synchromesh</b> on all <b>gears.</b> A {{conventional}} Borg & Beck clutch with mechanical linkage was used and {{drive from the}} gearbox was by shaft to the rear combined transfer box and differential assembly which incorporated reverse gear, thereby allowing five reverse gears also, and then by a long shaft to the front differential which incorporated a simple dog clutch to enable four-wheel drive when required. A conventional separate transfer case was not possible due to the cruciform layout of the vehicle chassis which placed the junction of the cruciform where the transfer box would reside on a conventional ladder-type chassis. Bendix [...] "Tracta" [...] type constant velocity joints were fitted at all wheel stations. All transmission assemblies were sealed against the ingress of water.|$|R
5000|$|The Holden EH was an {{automobile}} produced by General Motors-Holden's in Australia from 1963 to 1965.The EH {{was released in}} August 1963 replacing the Holden EJ series {{and was the first}} Holden to incorporate the new [...] "Red" [...] engine, with a 7 main bearing crankshaft instead of the 4 main bearing crankshaft used in the [...] "Grey" [...] engine. The larger capacity 149 ci (2400cc) engine was first only sold attached to a three-speed manual gear box or the [...] "Hydramatic" [...] three-speed automatic transmission with a (column shift). The 179 ci (2900cc) engine was only sold with the [...] "Hydramatic" [...] three-speed. The first EH with a 179 ci engine and a manual gear box, was called the [...] "EH-S4". The 179ci engine then became available with an up-graded manual gear box, with stronger gears than the 149ci gear box. The three-speed manual (column shift) gear boxes had no <b>synchromesh</b> on first <b>gear,</b> requiring double de-clutching. The 179 ci manual also used an up-graded clutch.|$|R
5000|$|... 3.8-litre {{cars have}} leather-upholstered bucket seats, an aluminium-trimmed centre {{instrument}} panel and console (changed to vinyl and leather in 1963), and a Moss four-speed gearbox that lacks <b>synchromesh</b> for first <b>gear</b> ("Moss box"). 4.2-litre cars have more comfortable seats, improved brakes and electrical systems, and an all-synchromesh four-speed gearbox. 4.2-litre cars {{also have a}} badge on the boot proclaiming [...] "Jaguar 4.2 Litre E-Type" [...] (3.8 cars have a simple [...] "Jaguar" [...] badge). Optional extras included chrome spoked wheels and a detachable hard top for the OTS. When leaving the factory the car was originally fitted with Dunlop 6.40 Ã— 15 inch RS5 tyres on 15 Ã— 5K wire wheels (with the rear fitting 15 Ã— 5KÂ½ wheels supplied with 6.50 X15 Dunlop Racing R5 tyres in mind of competition). Later Series One cars were fitted with Dunlop 185 - 15 SP41 or 185 VR 15 Pirelli Cinturato as radial ply tyres.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{an initial}} period of {{uncertainty}} and poor sales {{due to the}} ravaged state of the French economy, the 4CV had sold 37,000 units by mid-1949 and {{was the most popular}} car in France. Across the Rhine 1,760 4CVs were sold in West Germany in 1950, accounting for 23% of that country's imported cars, and ranking second only to the Fiat 500 on the list. The car remained in production for more than another decade. Claimed power output increased subsequently to [...] as increased fuel octanes allowed for higher compression ratios, which along with the relatively low weight of the car (620 kg) enabled the manufacturers to report a 0 - 90 km/h time of 38 seconds and a top speed barely under 100 km/h. The engine was notable also for its elasticity, the second and top gear both being usable for speeds between 5 and 100 km/h; the absence of <b>synchromesh</b> on first <b>gear</b> would presumably have discouraged use of the bottom gear except when starting from rest.|$|R
