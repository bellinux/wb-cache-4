50|$|In {{building}} construction there are basically {{two types of}} structural steel: hot-rolled steel shapes and cold-formed steel shapes. The hot rolled steel shapes are formed at elevated temperatures while the cold-formed steel shapes are formed at room temperature. Cold-formed steel structural members are shapes commonly manufactured from steel plate, sheet metal or <b>strip</b> <b>material.</b> The manufacturing process involves forming the material by either press-braking or cold roll forming to achieve the desired shape.|$|E

Because the magazine could not receive foreign comic <b>strip</b> <b>material</b> during the war, as the main local artist, he drew most of the comics during that period. He took over the main series, Spirou et Fantasio, from the Frenchman Rob-Vel: he added the sidekick Fantasio to the lone hero Spirou in order to add some comic relief in the series. He then created his own series, Jean Valhardi, and drew episodes of the American series published during the war, like Red Ryder and Superman, when due to the war, the American pages could not reach the publisher.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Taper {{junction}} {{material loss}} {{is the result}} of corrosion and mechanical wear. The significance of the taper junction material loss is highlighted by studies that compared resurfacing and total hip replacements of the same type and size. High volumes of material loss are reported, especially from the head taper, but the pattern of wear is unknown. One report characterized the material loss pattern of five tapers (n= 5) into axisymmetrical and asymmetrical, along the long axis of the taper. We noticed more than two patterns on our retrievals and we set out to characterize these types and relate them to clinical variables. Methods: We retrospectively analysed retrieved cobalt-chromium tapers (n= 146) using a roundness measurement machine. We also performed a corrosion classification and collected clinical data (metal ion levels, time to revision, component sizes). A non-blinded author devised a four-group classification (table). Two blinded authors classified the material loss patterns derived from the roundness measurement machine. Results: The four groups of material loss patterns Low wear (n= 62), Open-end band (n= 29), <b>Stripped</b> <b>material</b> loss (n= 51) and Coup-Countercoup (n= 4). Kappa was 0. 78 (p< 0. 001) in the assessment of interobserver reliability. Kruskal-Wallis test revealed: - Significantly higher volumes of wear on the taper of <b>Stripped</b> <b>material</b> loss compared to Low wear (p< 0. 001) and Open-end band compared to Low wear (p< 0. 001) groups. - Significantly higher chromium ion blood levels in the open-end band compared to the <b>Stripped</b> <b>material</b> loss group. - Significantly higher Cobalt ion blood levels in the <b>Stripped</b> <b>material</b> loss compared to the Low wear group - Significantly higher Cobalt/Chromium ration in the Open-end band compared to the Low wear group One-way ANOVA analysis revealed: - Significant difference between in the head sizes between the groups (p= 0. 01). Post-hoc analysis located the difference between the Low wear (median= 40, range= 20) and Open-end band (median= 49, range= 20) groups (p< 0. 001). - Significantly higher time to revision in the <b>Stripped</b> <b>material</b> loss compared to the Low wear group (p= 0. 05), in the post-hoc analysis. - Significantly higher corrosion scores in the <b>Stripped</b> <b>material</b> loss compared to the Low wear group (p< 0. 001) and the Open-end band compared to the Low wear group (p< 0. 001). Discussion: The results suggests that corrosion becomes worse over time and that the material loss pattern evolves gradually from the Low wear to Open-end band and finally to Stripped. Further analysis is required to assess the factors that affect the Coup-countercoup group...|$|R

The Four Color books reprinted {{a variety of}} newspaper <b>strip</b> <b>material,</b> and issue #4 featured a selection of Donald Duck strips. The Disney reprints were a big seller, and encouraged Western to convert Mickey Mouse Magazine series (which had included comics along with text stories, poems, jokes, puzzles, games and full-page illustrations) into a full-fledged comic book, Walt Disney's Comics and Stories, whose first issue was dated October 1940 and by the mid-1950s was the best selling comic book in America with a circulation hovering around three million a month (with the highest level reached being 3,038,000 for the Sept. 1953 issue). In addition many releases in its popular Big Little Books series adapted Disney comic book and comic strip stories.|$|E

40|$|A resilient, flexible, pressure-activated, {{high-temperature}} seal {{is adapted}} to be interposed {{between high and low}} pressure regions to provide sealing between opposing surfaces of adjacent relatively movable structures. The seal comprises at least one C-shaped sheet element. The C-shaped element design enables the seal to be pressure-activated to provide a radially outward biasing force, responsive to a seal-activating pressure differential acting across the seal thereby increasing resiliency. A centrally-located, resilient core structure provides load bearing and insulating properties. In an exemplary embodiment where at least two seal elements are used, each layer has a cutout slot pattern and the remaining <b>strip</b> <b>material</b> pattern. The slots provide flexibility to the seal, enabling the seal to be manually contoured to seal around corners and curves. The <b>strip</b> <b>material</b> of each layer covers the slots in each adjacent layer to minimize leakage through the slots. Attached barrier strips can block interface leakage between the seal and the opposing surfaces...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the properties of tidally <b>stripped</b> <b>material</b> from disrupting substructure haloes or subhaloes in a sample of high resolution cosmological N-body host haloes ranging from galaxy- to cluster-mass scales. We focus on devising methods to recover the infall mass and infall eccentricity of subhaloes from the properties of their tidally <b>stripped</b> <b>material</b> (i. e. tidal streams). Our analysis reveals that there is a relation between the scatter of stream particles about the best-fit debris plane and the infall mass of the progenitor subhalo. This allows us to reconstruct the infall mass from the spread of its tidal debris in space. We also find that the spread in radial velocities of the debris material (as measured by an observer located at the centre of the host) correlates with the infall eccentricity of the subhalo, which allows us to reconstruct its orbital parameters. We devise an automated method to identify leading and trailing arms that can, in principle at least, be applied to observations of stellar streams from satellite galaxies. This method is based on the energy distribution of material in the tidal stream. Using this method, we show that the mass associated wit...|$|R

40|$|The classic single-degenerate {{model for}} the {{progenitors}} of Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia) predicts that the supernova ejecta should be enriched with solar-like abundance <b>material</b> <b>stripped</b> from the companion star. Spectroscopic observations of normal SNe Ia at late times, however, have not resulted in definite detection of hydrogen. In this Letter, we study line formation in SNe Ia at nebular times using non-LTE spectral modeling. We present, for the first time, multidimensional radiative transfer calculations of SNe Ia with <b>stripped</b> <b>material</b> mixed in the ejecta core, based on hydrodynamical simulations of ejecta-companion interaction.
