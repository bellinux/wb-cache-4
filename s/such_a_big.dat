This shows the calculating brains of Churaman where he managed to make the enemy flee {{without having to go}} in for any bloodshed. In 1705 there was a war with Mughal subadar Mukhtar khan of Agra and with Raja Bahadur in 1707 at Sinsini. In the second war at Sinsini 1000 Jats were lost but they got the victory.|$|E

Although Quirke was a well-known veteran television actress, she auditioned along with many others for the role. Her audition, like that of others, used scenes from the first two episodes. Chibnall says that the producers worried that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> star might not wish {{to do justice to}} such small role, but found that Quirke delivered a superb performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{game against}} the Notre Dame All-Stars had been {{originally}} devised by Frankford. It was planned as non-league exhibition game between former Notre Dame stars and the top NFL team in the east; after defeating the Maroons 20–0, Frankford had believed they would indeed be the NFL's top eastern team. However, when they were later defeated by the Maroons in a second contest, they lost the right to play the game. Instead, Pottsville would host the All-Stars at Minersville Park, while Frankford scheduled another league {{game against the}} Cleveland Bulldogs. Pottsville was excited to host Notre Dame, hoping {{it would be a}} huge financial windfall for the team. However, they felt that Minersville Park, a high school field with a low capacity, was too small for <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> event. Instead, they scheduled the game in Philadelphia, in the Yellow Jackets' territory. Frankford protested to commissioner Carr, who warned the Maroons in writing that they faced suspension if they played in Philadelphia. However, the Maroons claimed that the league office verbally approved the game during a telephone call.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and Mats Wilander {{entered the}} tournament. Wilander won the singles title and both his Davis Cup singles rubbers in the Swedish loss to Australia at Kooyong shortly after. Following the 1983 Australian Open, the International Tennis Federation {{prompted}} the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia {{to change the}} site of the tournament, because the Kooyong stadium was then inappropriate to serve <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> event. In 1988 the tournament was first held at Flinders Park (later renamed Melbourne Park). The change of the venue also led to a change of the court surface from grass to a hard court surface known as Rebound Ace. Mats Wilander was the only player to win the tournament on both grass and hard courts. In 2008, after being used for 20 years, the Rebound Ace was replaced by a cushioned, medium-paced, acrylic surface known as Plexicushion Prestige. Roger Federer and Serena Williams are the only players to win the Australian Open on both Rebound Ace and Plexicushion Prestige. The main benefits of the new surface are better consistency and less retention of heat because of a thinner top layer. This change was accompanied by changes in the surfaces of all lead-up tournaments to the Australian Open. The change was controversial because of the new surface's similarity to DecoTurf, the surface used by the US Open.|$|E
