The focus here is on the farmers’ councils and their activities regarding the operational, agricultural, financial, and management performance of the irrigation system. The performances of the system are evaluated using interview schedule and direct field observations. The discharge is measured using float method and seepage loss using ponding method.

25|$|Hydraulic mining {{was also}} used during the Australian gold rushes where it was called {{hydraulic}} <b>sluicing.</b> One notable location was at the Oriental Claims near Omeo in Victoria where it was used between the 1850s and early 1900s, with abundant evidence of the damage still being visible today.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{landscape}} {{can be seen}} at Las Médulas {{in northern}} Spain, where Roman engineers ground-sluiced the rich gold alluvial deposits of the river Sil. Pliny the Elder mentions in his Naturalis Historia that Spain had encroached on the sea and local lakes as a result of ground <b>sluicing</b> operations.|$|E
25|$|After the sluice-box stage, {{placer mining}} may become {{increasingly}} large scale, requiring larger organisations and higher capital expenditures. Small claims owned and mined by individuals {{may need to}} be merged into larger tracts. Difficult-to-reach placer deposits may be mined by tunnels. Water may be diverted by dams and canals to placer mine active river beds or to deliver water needed to wash dry placers. The more advanced techniques of ground <b>sluicing,</b> hydraulic mining and dredging may be used.|$|E
2500|$|In {{place of}} the Overfall he {{constructed}} three shallow <b>sluices</b> and one deep scouring <b>sluice,</b> between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel, known as a drag boat, to scrape the silt away from the quay walls. <b>Sluices</b> 1, 2 and 4 ('shallow') are used to control the water level, while <b>sluice</b> 3 [...] ('deep') removes the silt. When the deep <b>sluice</b> is opened at low tide, a powerful undertow is created which sucks the silt out of the harbour and into the river. In March 1988, the <b>sluice</b> control was computerised and automated.|$|R

25|$|The widest {{application}} of trip hammers, however, {{seems to have}} occurred in Roman mining, where ore from deep veins was first crushed into small pieces for further processing. Here, the regularity and spacing of large indentations on stone anvils indicate the use of cam-operated ore stamps, much like the devices of later medieval mining. Such abraded stone anvils have been found at numerous Roman silver and gold mines in Western Europe, including at Dolaucothi (Wales), and on the Iberian peninsula, where the datable examples are from the 1st and 2nd century AD. At Dolaucothi, these trip-hammers were hydraulic-driven and possibly also at other Roman mining sites, where the large scale use of the hushing and ground <b>sluicing</b> technique meant that large amounts of water were directly available for powering the machines.|$|E

2500|$|Hydraulic mining had its {{precursor}} in {{the practice}} of ground <b>sluicing,</b> a development of which is also known as [...] "hushing", in which surface streams of water were diverted so as to erode gold-bearing gravels.

[...] The Romans used ground <b>sluicing</b> to remove overburden and the gold-bearing debris in Las Médulas of Spain, and Dolaucothi in Britain.

40|$|Research on {{the impact}} of <b>sluice</b> {{regulation}} on water quantity and quality (WQQ) processes in regulated rivers is a fundamental requirement in basin management at present but remains a research puzzle at the basin scale because of insufficient monitoring data, irregular order of <b>sluice</b> or dam regulation, and numerous influencing factors in real-world river basins. This paper presents a laboratory experiment in a single reach as an artificial case study and develops a dynamic numerical model. Through analysis of the observed data and modeling, the river WQQ processes under <b>sluice</b> regulation are investigated and the interaction of WQQ and its regulation capacity downstream of a <b>sluice</b> is explored. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis of model parameters is carried out and the model validity is tested on a prototype (real-world) scale. Results show that the WQQ variation downstream of a <b>sluice</b> has complicated nonlinear relationships with upstream flow, pollutant load into a river, and <b>sluice</b> regulation. The impact of <b>sluice</b> regulation on water quantity and thus, water quality, is inversely proportional to the relative opening of <b>sluice</b> and upstream flow, respectively. The WQQ results simulated by the numerical model in a real-world-scale system are reasonable, and the patterns are similar to experimental observation. Thus, the experiment and the numerical model will provide a potential approach to mimicking real reaches in a river system with dense <b>sluices</b> where the reaches between adjacent <b>sluices</b> are short and the change in <b>sluice</b> regulation is a dominant factor, such as in the Huai River basin of China. This study provides the foundation and reference for exploration of the mechanism of WQQ changes in regulated river systems and the technical support for the joint WQQ regulation of dams and <b>sluices</b> in complicated real river basins.
