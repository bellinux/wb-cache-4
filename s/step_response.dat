25|$|The <b>step</b> <b>response</b> of {{a system}} in a given initial state {{consists}} of the time evolution of its outputs when its control inputs are Heaviside step functions. In electronic engineering and control theory, <b>step</b> <b>response</b> is the time behaviour of the outputs of a general system when its inputs change from zero to one {{in a very short}} time. The concept can be extended to the abstract mathematical notion of a dynamical system using an evolution parameter.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} respond quickly and {{accurately}} to an external perturbation with a <b>stepping</b> <b>response</b> is critical to avoid falls and this ability is impaired in older, compared to young adults. However, {{little is known about}} whether young and older adults improve compensatory <b>stepping</b> <b>responses</b> similarly with practice. This study compares the extent to which young and older adults can improve, retain, and generalize postural compensatory <b>steps</b> in <b>response</b> to external perturbations. Centre of mass displacement, step characteristics and lower leg muscle activation latencies were measured during one training session of compensatory <b>stepping</b> in <b>response</b> to large surface translations in 13 young and 12 older adults. Retention was tested 24 h later. Older adults decreased their center of mass displacements over repeated exposure to large surface translations in both the anterior and posterior directions and retained these improvements. In contrast, young adults only showed adaptation and retention of forward <b>stepping</b> <b>responses.</b> Neither group was able to generalize improvements in <b>stepping</b> <b>responses</b> across directions. These results suggest step training may be beneficial for older adults, however additional, multidirectional training may be necessary to facilitate generalization of postural <b>stepping</b> <b>responses</b> for any direction of a slip or trip...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} system identification techniques have been proposed to assess dynamic cerebral autoregulation in critically ill patients. From these methods, the response to a standard stepwise {{change in blood pressure}} can be estimated. Responses lacking physiological consistency are a common occurrence and could be the consequence of particular system identification procedures or, alternatively, caused by measurements with a poor signal-to-noise ratio. A multi-observer approach was adopted in this paper to classify cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) <b>step</b> <b>responses</b> to spontaneous changes in arterial blood pressure in a group of 43 neonates with a mean gestational age of 33. 7 weeks (range 24 - 42 weeks) and a mean birthweight of 1, 980 g (range 570 - 3, 910 g). Three experienced observers independently analysed the estimated <b>step</b> <b>responses</b> in 191 recordings each lasting 100 s; for an autoregressive (ARX) model, 124 (65 %) of the <b>step</b> <b>responses</b> were accepted by {{at least two of the}} three observers. Two other system identification methods, transfer function analysis and the moving average Wiener-Laguerre model, gave 90 (45 %) and 98 (51 %) acceptable responses, respectively. Only 54 epochs (28 %) were accepted with all three methods. With 88 (46 %) responses rejected by at least two methods, it can be concluded that signal quality was the main reason for nonphysiological <b>step</b> <b>responses.</b> To avoid the need for subjective visual selection, an automatic procedure for classifying <b>step</b> <b>responses</b> was implemented leading to sensitivities and specificities in the range 85 - 90 %, with respect to the agreement with subjective evaluations. Objective selection of CBFV <b>step</b> <b>responses</b> is thus feasible and could also be adapted for other physiological measurement techniques relying on system identification methods. 7484...|$|R
40|$|Balance {{disorders}} {{are common in}} many neurological diseases. Well-controlled balance requires all balance systems, including visual, vestibular, and somatosensory system, providing specific information about position and motion {{of the body and}} the motor system executing appropriate strategies. The aim of the thesis is to apply modulation of visual, vestibular, and somatosensory systems in order to develop new treatments for balance disorders. In this thesis, two types of balance disorders were investigated separately: i) Parkinson’s disease (PD), caused by central nervous system neurodegeneration, and ii) vestibular disorders, caused by peripheral vestibular dysfunction. Both patients groups experience difficulties in postural control. In order to determine an efficient therapeutic method to improve their balance function, the efficacy of different assistive techniques, treatments, and physiotherapy on performance was examined in the two patients groups. First, characteristics of protective <b>stepping</b> <b>response</b> in healthy young and elderly adults were examined. Participants were tested on a moving platform prompting a protective step to characterise their forward and backward <b>stepping</b> <b>responses.</b> Second, characteristics of protective <b>stepping</b> <b>response</b> in PD patients were described. Use of vibrotactile feedback on protective <b>stepping</b> <b>response</b> was also tested to investigate its effect on enhancing the <b>stepping</b> <b>response</b> in PD patients via the somatosensory system. Third, non-invasive brain stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), incorporated with physiotherapy was applied on PD patients to investigate its effect on protective <b>stepping</b> <b>response</b> via changing corticomotor excitability. The last part of the thesis, intensive visual motion stimulation incorporated within a customised exercise programme was provided to patients with peripheral vestibular disorders and visual vertigo, whereby patients experience symptom provocation or exacerbation when exposed to busy visual motion environments (i. e. crowds) to investigate whether this intensive programme could enhance improvement of subjective visual vertigo symptoms and objective perceptual and postural measures of visual dependency. In general, the efficacy of different assistive techniques and treatment schemes on balance control in patients with PD or vestibular disorders was studied. The outcome of different treatment techniques will be presented in the thesis. Imperial Users onl...|$|R
25|$|In {{the case}} of linear dynamic systems, much can be {{inferred}} about the system from these characteristics. Below the <b>step</b> <b>response</b> of a simple two-pole amplifier is presented, {{and some of these}} terms are illustrated.|$|E
25|$|As an aside, it may {{be noted}} that {{real-world}} departures from this linear two-pole model occur due to two major complications: first, real amplifiers have more than two poles, as well as zeros; and second, real amplifiers are nonlinear, so their <b>step</b> <b>response</b> changes with signal amplitude.|$|E
25|$|When the {{open-loop}} gain has several poles, {{rather than the}} single pole of the above example, feedback can result in complex poles (real and imaginary parts). In a two-pole case, the result is peaking in the frequency response of the feedback amplifier near its corner frequency and ringing and overshoot in its <b>step</b> <b>response.</b> In the case {{of more than two}} poles, the feedback amplifier can become unstable and oscillate. See the discussion of gain margin and phase margin. For a complete discussion, see Sansen.|$|E

40|$|The mutual {{synchronization}} {{system of}} the communication network, composed of four oscillators, is investigated in the work. Following aims were raised in this work: to compose the mathematical model of the synchronization system, to find the exact expressions of the <b>step</b> <b>responses</b> {{of the system and}} of the phase differences of the oscillations of oscillators, to investigate the transients in the synchronization system. The mathematical model of the system is the matrix differential equation with delayed argument. This equation is solved applying the method of consequent integration (method of “steps”). For this purpose the interval is divided to subintervals of equal length. The equation in each subinterval is solved separately, as ordinary differential equation without delayed argument. Using obtained expression of the solution, the expressions of <b>step</b> <b>responses</b> of the system are got.

25|$|The {{sampling}} theorem was {{implied by}} the work of Harry Nyquist in 1928,nbsp& in which he showed that up to 2B independent pulse samples could be sent through a system of bandwidth B; but he did not explicitly consider the problem of sampling and reconstruction of continuous signals. About the same time, Karl Küpfmüller showed a similar result, and discussed the sinc-function impulse response of a band-limiting filter, via its integral, the <b>step</b> <b>response</b> Integralsinus; this bandlimiting and reconstruction filter that is so central to the sampling theorem is sometimes referred to as a Küpfmüller filter (but seldom so in English).|$|E
25|$|From a {{practical}} standpoint, knowing {{how the system}} responds to a sudden input is important because large and possibly fast deviations from the long term steady state may have extreme effects on the component itself and on other portions of the overall system dependent on this component. In addition, the overall system cannot act until the component's output settles down to some vicinity of its final state, delaying the overall system response. Formally, knowing the <b>step</b> <b>response</b> of a dynamical system gives information on the stability of such a system, and {{on its ability to}} reach one stationary state when starting from another.|$|E
25|$|From {{a signal}} {{processing}} point of view, the Gibbs phenomenon is the <b>step</b> <b>response</b> of a low-pass filter, and the oscillations are called ringing or ringing artifacts. Truncating the Fourier transform of a signal {{on the real}} line, or the Fourier series of a periodic signal (equivalently, a signal on the circle) corresponds to filtering out the higher frequencies by an ideal (brick-wall) low-pass/high-cut filter. This can be represented as convolution of the original signal with the impulse response of the filter (also known as the kernel), which is the sinc function. Thus the Gibbs phenomenon {{can be seen as}} the result of convolving a Heaviside step function (if periodicity is not required) or a square wave (if periodic) with a sinc function: the oscillations in the sinc function cause the ripples in the output.|$|E
40|$|Internal impulse and <b>step</b> <b>responses</b> {{are derived}} from the {{thresholds}} of short probe flashes {{by means of a}} drift-correcting perturbation technique. The approach is based on only two postulated systems properties: quasi-linearity and peak detection. A special feature of the technique is its strong reduction of the concealing effect of sensitivity drift within and between sessions. Results were found to be repeatable, even after about one year. For a 1 ° foveal disk at 1200 td stationary level, impulse responses of increments and decrements were found to be mirror-symmetrical. They were equal to the derivatives of the measured <b>step</b> <b>responses.</b> As a consequence the threshold of any fast-changing retinal illumination should be predictable. This will be tested in a subsequent paper. The transfer function of the system responding to a 1 ° stimulus shows a band-pass filter type of processing for transients, confirming quantitatively earlier findings. In contrast, a foveal point source on an extended background of 1200 td, to which impulse and <b>step</b> <b>responses</b> appear also to be linearly related, gives rise to low-pass filter action of the system...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} subtle expressions of functional asymmetries in newborn leg movements, kinematic registrations {{were made on}} a sample of 40 healthy fullterm newborn infants during performance of the <b>stepping</b> <b>response.</b> Time–position {{data were collected from}} markers attached to the hip, knee and ankle joints of the left and right leg, and movements of both legs recorded simultaneously. Findings included evident side differences in terms of smoother trajectories of the right leg as a consequence of less movement segmentation compared to the left leg. Additionally, analyses of intralimb coordination revealed side differences with regard to stronger ankle–knee couplings and smaller phase shifts in the right leg. The findings suggest that asymmetries in newborn <b>stepping</b> <b>responses</b> are present in terms of spatio-temporal parameters and intralimb coordination. No evidence of a lateral preference in terms of frequency of the first foot moved was found.

40|$|AbstractPeak {{velocity}} and peak acceleration of disaccommodation <b>step</b> <b>responses</b> remain invariant of response magnitude for a constant starting position and they increase linearly with proximity of starting position. This suggests that disaccommodation response is initiated towards an initial (default) destination and is switched mid-flight {{to attain the}} desired final destination. The dioptric location of initial destination was estimated from the x-intercept of regression of peak velocity on response starting position. The x-intercept correlated well with subject’s cycloplegic refractive state and poorly with their dark focus of accommodation. Altering the dark focus by inducing fatigue in the accommodative system did not alter the x-intercept. These observations suggest that cycloplegic refractive state is a good behavioral correlate of initial destination of disaccommodation <b>step</b> <b>responses...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to analyze and simulate the pulse-width-modulated (PWM) dc-dc buck-boost converter and design a controller to gain stability for the buck-boost converter. The PWM dc-dc buck-boost converter reduces and/or increases dc voltage from one level to a another level in devices that need to, at different times or states, increase or decrease the output voltage. In this thesis, equations for transfer funtions for a PWM dc-dc open-loop buck-boost converter operating in continuous-conduction-mode (CCM) are derived. For the pre-chosen design, the open-loop characterics and the <b>step</b> <b>responses</b> are studied. The converter is simulated in PSpice to validate the theoretical analysis. AC analysis of the buck-boost converter is performed using theoretical values in MatLab and a discrete point method in PSpice. Three disturbances, change in load current, input voltage, and duty cycle are examined using <b>step</b> <b>responses</b> of the system. The <b>step</b> <b>responses</b> of the output voltage are obtained using MatLab Simulink and validated using PSpice simulation. Design and simulation of an integral-lead (type III) controller is chosen to reduce dc error and gain stability. Equations for the integral-lead controller are given based on steady-state and AC analysis of the open-loop circuit, with a design method illustrated. The designed controller is implemented in the circuit, and the ac behavior of the system is presented. Closed loop transfer fuctions are derived for the buck-boost converter. AC analysis of the buck-boost converter is studied using both theoretical values and a discrete point method in PSpice.

40|$|AbstractDynamic {{properties}} and control strategies of <b>step</b> <b>responses</b> by accommodation and disaccommodation differ from one another. Peak velocity of accommodation increases with response magnitude, while peak velocity and peak acceleration of disaccommodation increase with starting position. These dynamic properties can be modeled as control strategies that use independent acceleration-pulse and velocity-step components that are integrated respectively into phasic-velocity signals that control movement and tonic-position signals that control magnitude. Accommodation is initiated toward its final destination by an acceleration-pulse whose width increases with response magnitude to increase peak velocity. Disaccommodation is initiated toward a default destination (the far point) by an acceleration-pulse whose height increases with dioptric {{distance of the}} starting position to increase peak velocity and peak acceleration. Both responses are completed and maintained by tonic-position signals whose amplitudes are proportional to the final destination.
