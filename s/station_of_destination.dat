30|$|The SOS may notably affect {{passengers}} when {{either their}} <b>stations</b> <b>of</b> origin or their <b>stations</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> are skipped, {{at which point}} they {{have to wait for}} at least one more train departure interval (hereafter referred to as the headway). To realize the greatest transportation capacity, we assumed that the timetable scheme had a parallel train configuration. The mean speeds of all trains were assumed to be equivalent, which is an assumption that can also be applied to all-stop schemes. Moreover, the total trip time and total number of decelerations and accelerations must affect the operating costs of a metro company. Many previous studies on the SOS focused only on reducing the journey or trip times of passengers, without considering costs to the company, for e.g., Li’s model [7]. Additionally, the time saved largely depended on the difference in headways between the all-stop and SOS schemes in Vuchic’s study [8], yet this may be unrealistic because the headways could be similar. To resolve these issues, a novel estimation method is presented in this paper.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a problem {{currently}} receiving increasing at- tention for its economic implications in the railways companies and {{in the safety of}} travelers. The growing demand for high-speed trains and the compe- tition with other operators pushes companies to increase rail transport services to better meet the demand with obvious implications on the company's prot. However, the high-speed trains have to undergo special maintenance services, with predetermined constraints ill-structured and dicult to represent math- ematically. In addition, the maintenance service is highly specialized and can only run on specic platforms in the <b>stations</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> and is subject to a more articulated process. This makes models existing in the literature not adequate to represent these new problems. In particular, formulations of the problem of routing of trains integrated with the one of the maintenance do not exist, even if, indeed, the two problems aect each other and formulations of the two separate parts lead to sub-optimal solutions of the overall problem. In the talk a new integrated approach is presented by means of a mixed integer mathematical formulation and computational results discussed...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} three decades the process <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image {{formation}} occurred as a significant part in tourism research. Although many researchers have greatly contributed to this important research field, still several aspects <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image are not well understood and require attention. Level <b>of</b> satisfaction, <b>destination</b> choice decision-making process, after-decision-making behaviours, intention to revisit and willingness to recommend are indisputably dependent on destination image. This paper looks at the concept <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image and the instruments <b>of</b> measuring <b>destination</b> image. In particular, the process <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image formation and the factors that shape the destination image is highlighted. Afterwards, a short review of the ECC Event and a literature review of the methodologies existing in the literature regarding measurement <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> image are presented. Finally, the research methodology that will be implemented in the measurement of the image improvement of Linz during the ECC Event in 2009 is shortly described.

Basic marketing mix refers to the process <b>of</b> creating a <b>destination</b> product, types <b>of</b> communication strategies, price planning and distribution. Marketing mix <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> is extended by partnership cooperation, packages, programming and people. The practical part is focused on application of theoretical knowledge into practice. This part is consisting of delimitation <b>of</b> selected <b>destination</b> and its analysis.

40|$|Many {{next-generation}} distributed applications, such as grid computing, {{require a}} single source {{to communicate with}} a group <b>of</b> <b>destinations.</b> Traditionally, such applications are implemented using multicast communication.

If one <b>of</b> the <b>destinations</b> is not reachable, the entire multicast request (say, grid task request) may fail.
