5|$|It was {{originally}} revealed as Codename: Kingdoms during Microsoft's E3 2010 press conference, {{along with the}} announcement that the game was being developed by Crytek. During the Microsoft Press Conference at E3 2011, Ryse was announced as a Kinect-only title. The announcement entailed a prerendered trailer with minor gameplay footage. The gameplay footage featured players using their own body gestures to control the protagonist to fight against enemies, and perform actions like sword wielding, blocking attacks with a shield, and head-butting. The trailer served as a test for Crytek to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> general audience liked the Kinect features or not.|$|E
5|$|When The Great Silence was {{screened}} for Darryl F. Zanuck of 20th Century Fox to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> film could {{be released on}} the American market, he was offended by the film (to {{the point where he}} reportedly swallowed the cigar he was smoking in shock upon watching the ending), and refused to distribute it in the United States. 20th Century Fox did, however, distribute the film in Italy and several other markets. The company also considered a remake of the film starring Clint Eastwood, which eventually evolved into a largely unrelated project by Universal Pictures, Joe Kidd.|$|E

5|$|From {{this order}} Stone {{reasonably}} {{believed he had}} support nearby from McCall if needed; what {{he did not know}} was that McClellan had ordered McCall back to his previous position at Langley on October 21, putting any help for Stone further away. Stone's division numbered about 10,000 men and was posted around Poolesville, Maryland, about eight miles from Leesburg, with portions of his command at points along the Potomac shore. He moved his artillery to Edward's Ferry along the Potomac, from which he could shell the woods {{on the opposite side of}} the river, held by Confederate forces. Stone then sent three small boats with about 100 men from the 1st Minnesota Infantry across, who returned shortly without incident. Near sunset he sent out a small patrol of 20 soldiers of the 15th Massachusetts Infantry to scout toward Leesburg and <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Union movements had the desired effect or not. Crossing at Harrison's Island on the river, these men scaled Ball's Bluff and encountered what they believed was a Confederate camp of at least thirty men less than a mile inland. The patrol returned to Harrison's Island around 10 p.m. and reported by messenger to Stone at Edwards Ferry.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry {{the mimic}} shares signals {{similar to the}} model, but {{does not have the}} {{attribute}} that makes it unprofitable to predators (e.g., unpalatability). In other words, a Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing. It is named after Henry Walter Bates, an English naturalist whose work on butterflies in the Amazon rainforest (described in The Naturalist on the River Amazons) was pioneering in this field of study. Mimics {{are less likely to be}} found out (for example by predators) when in low proportion to their model. This phenomenon is called negative frequency dependent selection, and it applies in most forms of mimicry. Batesian mimicry can only be maintained if the harm caused to the predator by eating a model outweighs the benefit of eating a mimic. The nature of learning is weighted in favor of the mimics, for a predator that has a bad first experience with a model tends to avoid anything that looks like it for a long time, and does not re-sample soon to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> initial experience was a false negative. However, if mimics become more abundant than models, then the probability of a young predator having a first experience with a mimic increases. Such systems are therefore most likely to be stable where both the model and the mimic occur, and where the model is more abundant than the mimic. This is not the case in Müllerian mimicry, which is described next.|$|E

25|$|Probiotics {{have been}} the subject of {{research}} to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> health claims made for them have any supporting evidence. Overall scientific demonstration of probiotic effects requires defining a healthy microbiota and interactions between microbiota and host, and the difficulty to characterize probiotic effectiveness in health and disease. Recent developments of high-throughput sequencing technology and the consequent progresses of metagenomics represent a new approach for the future of probiotics research.|$|E
25|$|The {{direction}} of polarization rotation depends on {{the properties of the}} material through which the light is shone. A full treatment would {{have to take into account}} the effect of the external and radiation-induced fields on the wave function of the electrons, and then calculate the effect of this change on the refractive index of the material for each polarization, to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> right- or left circular polarization is slowed down more.|$|E

25|$|The {{fragment}} processor cannot {{perform a}} direct scatter operation because {{the location of}} each fragment on the grid is fixed {{at the time of}} the fragment's creation and cannot be altered by the programmer. However, a logical scatter operation may sometimes be recast or implemented with another gather step. A scatter implementation would first emit both an output value and an output address. An immediately following gather operation uses address comparisons to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> output value maps to the current output slot.|$|E
25|$|By this time, the Navy {{had decided}} the F-111 would not meet their requirements, and began {{development}} of a new dedicated fighter design, the VFAX program. In May 1966, McNamara again asked the forces to study the designs and <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> VFAX would meet the Air Force's F-X needs. The resulting studies took 18 months and concluded that the desired features were too different; the Navy stressed loiter time and mission flexibility, while the Air Force was now looking primarily for maneuverability.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court usually looks {{first to}} <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> right is a {{fundamental}} right by examining whether it is deeply rooted in American history and traditions. If the right is not a fundamental right, the court applies a rational basis test: if the violation of the right can be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, the law is then held valid. If the court establishes that the right being violated {{is a fundamental}} right, it applies strict scrutiny and asks whether the law is justified by a compelling state interest and whether the law is narrowly tailored to address that interest.|$|E
25|$|They operate {{very well}} in {{oxidizing}} atmospheres. If, however, a mostly reducing atmosphere (such as hydrogen {{with a small amount}} of oxygen) comes into contact with the wires, the chromium in the chromel alloy oxidizes. This reduces the emf output, and the thermocouple reads low. This phenomenon is known as green rot, due to the color of the affected alloy. Although not always distinctively green, the chromel wire will develop a mottled silvery skin and become magnetic. An easy way to check for this problem is to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> two wires are magnetic (normally, chromel is non-magnetic).|$|E
25|$|In 1764, Parliament {{passed the}} Currency Act to {{restrain}} the use of paper money, fearing that otherwise the colonists might evade debt payments. Parliament also passed the Sugar Act, imposing customs duties {{on a number of}} articles. That same year, Prime Minister George Grenville proposed direct taxes on the colonies to raise revenue, but he delayed action to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> colonies would propose some way to raise the revenue themselves. Parliament finally passed the Stamp Act in March 1765 which imposed direct taxes on the colonies for the first time. All official documents, newspapers, almanacs, and pamphlets were required to have the stamps—even decks of playing cards.|$|E

25|$|However, the Muslims soon {{sued for}} peace, and Ferdinand, {{aware of the}} {{weakness}} of the army and the difficulty of mountain warfare, declared that the rebels must choose between exile or baptism. Only those who could pay ten gold doblas were given passage, and the majority who could not pay had to stay and be baptized. The insurgents surrendered in waves, beginning from the middle of April, since some waited to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> first insurgents who surrendered were safe. The emigrants were escorted under guards to the port of Estepona and given passage to North Africa. The remaining were allowed to return home after converting, surrendering their arms and forfeiting their property.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} samples t-test is used when two separate sets of independent and identically distributed samples are obtained, one {{from each of}} the two populations being compared. For example, suppose we are evaluating the effect of a medical treatment, and we enroll 100subjects into our study, then randomly assign 50subjects to the treatment group and 50subjects to the control group. In this case, we have two {{independent samples}} and would use the unpaired form of the t-test. The randomization is not essential here – if we contacted 100people by phone and obtained each person's age and gender, and then used a two-sample t-test to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> mean ages differ by gender, this would also be an independent samples t-test, even though the data are observational.|$|E
25|$|Like many Carlists Caylà {{welcomed the}} fall of Alfonsist monarchy, unlike most of them he did not {{demonstrate}} hostility to the Republic and – clearly against most Carlists – he hoped that it would produce a genuine democracy. In his Joventut editorials Caylà remained cautious and preferred not to jump to conclusions as to the new regime. As a monarchist loyal to the carlist claimant he acknowledged with little enthusiasm {{that the majority of}} Spaniards opted for republican solution, though he seemed to respect the choice. He called his fellow Carlists not to renounce their vision, suggesting to <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Republic would turn into an orderly state or whether the project would fail. In his trademark style he warned that extremism was the key enemy of the new regime.|$|E
50|$|It also {{remains to}} be <b>seen</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> insider-outsider {{division}} that economists observe in European labor markets means that the young, precarious, non-voting, and non-owning outsiders have fundamentally conflicting aims with respect to older insiders, who tend to work full-time, long-term contracts, enjoy relatively high pension benefits and who command a disproportionate weight in European public opinion and political debate.|$|R
