Otano categorically denied any personal intent for his <b>signature</b> <b>on</b> the <b>account,</b> signing only [...] "on request of Urralburu" [...] in 1991 {{for the sake of the}} party. It was revealed as a case of illegal funding of the Spanish Socialists in Navarre and fraud to the Navarre Treasury driven by Gabriel Urralburu, with deep political implications. The coalition broke up right away, and Juan Cruz Alli, the leading figure of CDN (a splinter party of UPN), blamed the scandal directly on [...] "Socialist disloyalty" [...] for demolishing [...] "the possibility of building an alternative Government of Navarre than UPN or PSN integrating diverse political options and therefore betting on the support of the bulk of the Navarre society." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Randomizable {{encryption}} allows {{anyone to}} transform a ciphertext into a fresh ciphertext {{of the same}} message. Analogously, a randomizable signature can {{be transformed into a}} new <b>signature</b> <b>on</b> the same message. We combine randomizable encryption and signatures to a new primitive as follows: given a <b>signature</b> <b>on</b> a ciphertext, anyone, knowing neither the signing key nor the encrypted message, can randomize the ciphertext and adapt the signature to the fresh encryption, thus maintaining public verifiability. Moreover, given the decryption key and a <b>signature</b> <b>on</b> a ciphertext, one can compute (“extract”) a <b>signature</b> <b>on</b> the encrypted plaintext. As adapting a signature to a randomized encryption contradicts the standard notion of unforgeability, we introduce a weaker notion stating that no adversary can, after querying <b>signatures</b> <b>on</b> ciphertexts of its choice, output a <b>signature</b> <b>on</b> an encryption of a new message. This is reasonable since, due to extractability, a <b>signature</b> <b>on</b> an encrypted message can be interpreted as an encrypted <b>signature</b> <b>on</b> the message. Using Groth-Sahai proofs and Waters signatures, we give several instantiations of our primitive and prove them secure under classical assumptions in the standard model and the CRS setting.

In such a scheme a voter cannot prove what his vote was, which precludes vote selling. Besides, our primitive also yields an efficient round-optimal blind <b>signature</b> scheme based <b>on</b> standard assumptions, and namely for the classical Waters signature...|$|R
50|$|A cheque {{guarantee}} card was essentially an abbreviated portable {{letter of credit}} granted by a bank to a qualified depositor {{in the form of}} a plastic card that was used in conjunction with a cheque. This allowed retailers to accept cheques and providing that the retailer wrote the card number on the back of the cheque, it was signed in the retailer's presence, and the retailer verified the <b>signature</b> <b>on</b> the cheque against the <b>signature</b> <b>on</b> the card, then the cheque could not be stopped and payment could not be refused by the bank. This arrangement worked only for cheques drawn <b>on</b> an <b>account</b> provided by the bank that issued the card and could result in an overdraft with penalty interest.|$|R
