40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. M. E. thesis. June 2015. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: James Van de Ven. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 109 pages. Switch-mode hydraulic {{control is a}} compact and theoretically efficient alternative to throttling valve control or variable displacement pump control. The virtually variable displacement circuit created by a pulse-width modulated high-speed valve has drawbacks, such as large energy losses due to throttling and compressibility during valve transitions. Hydraulic <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> was proposed as method of reducing the throttling energy loss, by absorbing, in a small variable volume chamber, the flow that would normally be throttled across the transitioning high speed valve. An active locking mechanism was presented by Van de Ven that overcomes the main challenge with <b>soft</b> <b>switching,</b> which is a lock mechanism that releases quickly and with precise timing. A numerical model is developed for a switch-mode pumping circuit, utilizing the proposed <b>soft</b> <b>switch.</b> The model is then used {{as a means of}} designing a proof of concept prototype to further verify the model and provide a future optimization tool. The prototype design includes methods for controlling the <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> spring preload, travel distance, piston displacement required to unlock the <b>soft</b> <b>switch,</b> valve command duty ratio, switching cycle length, and load pressure. Testing demonstrated that the <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> <b>circuit</b> performed as expected within a set of parameter values, defining normal operation. High control valve switching periods, high load pressures, high flow rates, low <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> unlocking distances, and low spring preloads caused the <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> to unlock prematurely in the switching cycle. This resulted in the <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> to failing to absorb the switched volume pressure spike during control valve transitions, leading to low efficiencies. Under normal operating conditions, the <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> <b>circuit</b> was calculated to be 60. 9 % efficient, which is lower than the 62. 1 % efficiency for same <b>circuit</b> without a <b>soft</b> <b>switch,</b> and also lower than the 70. 5 % efficiency predicted by the numerical model. The discrepancies between the numerical and experimental model can be attributed to poor resolution in the measurement instruments, as well as the model not accurately capturing flow dynamics through the check valves behind the <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> piston. Since the <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> parameters were chosen to validate the lock release concept, and not to maximize efficiency, it was not unexpected that the baseline <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> case had lower efficiency than the control case. Using the insights gained from these model comparisons, an efficient locking <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> can be designed for use in a dual <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> <b>circuit</b> scheme, shown by Van de Ven to reduce energy losses by 66 % compared to a control circuit. A successful hydraulic <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> <b>circuit</b> will allow for the use of slower switching valves, which will reduce component cost as well as energy consumption...|$|R

40|$|Boost {{dc-to-dc}} converters {{have very}} good source interface properties. The input inductor makes the source current smooth and hence these converters provide very good EMI performance. On account of this good property, the boost converter is also the preferred converter for off-line UPF rectifiers. One of the issues of concern in these converters is the large size of the storage capacitor on the dc link. The boost converter suffers from the disadvantage of discontinuous current injected to the load. The size of the capacitor is therefore large. Further, the ripple current in the capacitor is {{as much as the}} load current; hence the ESR specification of the tank capacitor is quite demanding. This is specially so in the emerging application areas of automotive power conversion, where the input voltage is low (typically 12 V) and large voltage boost (4 to 5) are desired. The first part of this thesis suggests multi-phase boost converter to overcome the disadvantages of large size storage capacitor in boost converter. Comparison between the specification of single stage and multi-stages is thoroughly examined. Besides the average small signal analysis of N converters in parallel and obtaining an equivalent second order system are discussed. By paralleling the converters the design of closed loop control is a demanding task. To achieve proper current sharing among the stages using current control method is inevitable. Design and implementation of closed loop control of multi-phase boost converter both in analog and digital is the topic of next part of the thesis. Comparison between these two approaches is presented in this part and it will be shown that digital control is more convenient for such a topology on account of the requirement of synchronization, phase shifted operation, current balancing and other desired functions, which will be discussed later in detail. A new direct digital control method, which is simple and fast, is developed. Two different realizations with DSP controller and FPGA controller are considered. In {{the last part of the}} thesis a novel <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> <b>circuit</b> for boost converter is presented. It provides Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) for the main switch and Zero Current Switching (ZCS) for the auxiliary switch. The paper presents the idealized analysis giving all the circuit intervals and the equations necessary for the design of such a circuit. The proposed <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> <b>circuit</b> is particularly suited for the tapped-inductor boost circuit with a minimum number of extra components. Extension of the method to tapped inductor boost converter addresses the application of Zero Voltage Transition (ZVT) to high conversion ratio converters. Extension of the method to multiphase boost converter shows that with less number of auxiliary switches soft switching operation can be achieved for all interleaved switching devices. Several laboratory prototype boost converters have been built to confirm the theoretical results and design methods are matching with both simulation and experimental results...|$|E

40|$|Advisors: Donald Zinger. Committee members: Mansour Tahernezhadi; Peng Woo. LEDs are {{the most}} {{efficient}} way to turn an electric current into illumination. Connecting LEDs in either series or parallel is considered to be an option for better lighting and various other applications. Generally, when a large number of LEDs are considered, a parallel connection is opted. Connecting LEDs in parallel leads to current sharing problems as a result different currents flow in different branches. There are many ways in which current sharing problem in parallel connected LEDs can be solved. One such method is magnetic circuit wherein magnetically coupled inductors help resolve the current sharing problem. This thesis proposes a driver circuit for the magnetic circuit of LEDs. The LED driver is an electronic circuit that provides the LEDs with required power from the source. There are many sources of unneeded energy dissipation in the LED driver circuit. Inefficiencies in the inductors, such as eddy currents and winding resistance, are partially to blame. On the other hand, energy dissipation is primarily due to static and switching losses in the MOSFET. Static losses are due to the on resistance of the MOSFET, and can be decreased with specialty MOSFETs but never eliminated. When a MOSFET dissipates energy due to switching, it is said to be "hard switched". And thus it leads to energy losses. Hence, in order to increase the output and overall efficiency of the magnetic circuit of LEDs, soft switching is desired. This thesis proposed a <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> <b>circuit</b> to decrease the switching losses and thus to increase the efficiency in the system. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> approach for nonlinear autonomous vehicle control (AVC), the throttle, brake and steering subsystems are focused on in this paper because they are three key subsystems in the whole AVC system. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> control approach by applying it to the abovementioned subsystems...|$|R

The new controller has the features of operating on hard <b>switching,</b> <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> with one switch or two switches Pulse width modulated (PWM). It uses a closed loop current control {{with the addition of}} three <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> units. Each of the unit controls one phase of the ZCT inverter. After leaving the commutation logic unit whose role is to apply the current to the correct windings, in the correct direction, at the correct time, each signal goes through the <b>soft</b> <b>switching</b> unit, in order to <b>soft</b> <b>switch</b> the desired MOSFETs to be controlled. The current band is set to 5 A, which give...|$|R
