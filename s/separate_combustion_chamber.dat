5000|$|Wood-fired ovens, {{also known}} as wood ovens, are ovens that use wood fuel for cooking. There {{are two types of}} {{wood-fired}} ovens: [...] "black ovens" [...] and [...] "white ovens". Black ovens are heated by burning wood in a chamber. Food is cooked in that same chamber while the fire is still going, or in the heated chamber after the fire and coals have been swept out. White ovens are heated by heat transfer from a <b>separate</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> and flue-gas path. Thus, the oven remains [...] "white", or clean from ash. While the traditional wood-fired oven is a masonry oven, such ovens can also be built out of adobe, cob or cast iron.|$|E
50|$|In 1872 George Brayton {{patented}} {{a constant}} pressure internal combustion engine, initially using vaporized gas but later using liquid fuels such as kerosene and oil, known as Brayton's Ready Motor, The engine used one cylinder for compression, a receiver reservoir, {{and a separate}} power/expander cylinder in which the products of combustion expanded for the power stroke. The significant difference from other piston driven internal combustion engines {{is that the two}} cylinders are arranged so that the fuel/air mixture burns progressively at constant pressure as it is transferred from the compressor cylinder and reservoir to the working/expansion cylinder. In the original version a gas/air mixture was created by a heated-surface carburetor, then compressed and stored in a reservoir where it was ignited and then introduced into an expansion cylinder. A metal gauze/mesh was used to prevent the combustion running back to the reservoir. However at times the mesh failed, leading to flash-back or explosion. In 1874 Brayton filed a patent for a liquid fuel injection system. In this version, fuel was introduced as the air passed into the expansion cylinder, thus eliminating the explosion problem. Ignition remained a pilot flame. The principle was referred to as constant pressure combustion, and had been attempted without success by Sir William Siemens c1861 using a 4-cylinder engine with a <b>separate</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber.</b> Brayton not only achieved success in making the constant pressure cycle work, but he also made and marketed a commercial product.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental {{assessment of a}} free elastic-piston compressor (FEPC) equipped with a <b>separated</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber.</b> The FEPC is a proposed device that utilizes combustion of a hydrocarbon fuel to compress air into a high-pressure supply tank, thus potentially serving as a portable power supply candidate for untethered pneumatic systems of human-scale power output. The design and simulation of the FEPC concept have been shown in previous work, and the device's energetic merit outlined. The free "piston " consists of a custom-molded silicone-rubber membrane, clamped at the circumference, thus providing perfect blow-by sealing and near zero friction. The device {{is equipped with a}} custom-built <b>separated</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber,</b> which dynamically channels high-pressure combustion products of a hydrocarbon fuel in order to produce power strokes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} simulation of a resonating free liquid-piston compressor (FLPC) equipped with a <b>separated</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber.</b> The FLPC is a proposed device that utilizes combustion of a hydrocarbon fuel to compress air into a high-pressure supply tank, thus potentially serving as a portable power supply candidate for untethered pneumatic systems of human-scale power. The energetic merits of the FLPC concept have been outlined and demonstrated in previous work, and this new design aims at meeting its intended power density, all while maintaining an adequate energy density in a compact and simple device. In this new design, the free "piston " consists of a slug of water (or another incompressible fluid) trapped between two high-stiffness elastomeric diaphragms, thus providing perfect blow-by sealing and near zero friction, while adequately presenting the dynamic elements needed for smooth, continuous operation at desirable resonant frequencies. The device is essentially a tuned resonator whereby the inertia of the liquid piston and the elasticity of the diaphragms are selected to achieve a given resonant frequency. The passive dynamics of the engine are exploited to achieve efficiency through over-expansion, and to enable a return stroke with the small investment made in elastic energy with each power stroke. Additionally, {{the implementation of a}} <b>separated</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> – along with built-in actuated, high-flow intake and exhaust valves – ensures the feasibility of such desirable frequencies by decoupling the injection dynamics from the free-piston dynamics. The design and implementation of the device is shown, and simulated results are discussed...|$|R

It is also shown that the viscous losses associated with the liquid piston are negligible for the application discussed.

5000|$|The {{biggest concern}} about the design was the short flight time, which never met the {{projections}} made by Walter. With only {{seven and a half}} minutes of powered flight, the fighter truly was a dedicated point defense interceptor. To improve this, the Walter firm began developing two more advanced versions of the 509A rocket engine, the 509B and C, each with two <b>separate</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers</b> of differing sizes, one above the other, for greater efficiency. The B-version possessed a main combustion chamber—usually termed in German as a Hauptofen on these dual-chamber subtypes—with an exterior shape much like that on the single chamber 509A version, with the C-version having a forward chamber shape of a more cylindrical nature, designed for a higher top thrust level of some 2,000 kg (4,410 lb) of thrust, while simultaneously dropping the use of the cubic-shape [...] "frame" [...] for the forward engine propellant flow/turbopump mechanisms as used by the earlier -A and -B versions. The 509B and 509C rocket motors' main <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers</b> were supported by the [...] "thrust tube" [...] exactly as the 509A motor's single chamber had been. They were tuned for [...] "high power" [...] for takeoff and climb. The added, smaller volume [...] "lower" [...] chamber on the two later models, nicknamed the Marschofen with approximately 400 kg of thrust at its top performance level, was intended for more efficient, lower power cruise flight. These HWK 109-509B and C motors would improve endurance by as much as 50%. Two 163 Bs, models V6 and V18, were experimentally fitted with the lower-thrust B-version of the new twin-chamber engine (mandating twin <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> pressure gauges on the instrument panel of any Komet equipped with them), a retractable tailwheel, and tested in spring 1944.|$|R
