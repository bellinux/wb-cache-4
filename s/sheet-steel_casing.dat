500|$|The boiler was enveloped by Bulleid's air-smoothed <b>sheet-steel</b> <b>casing,</b> {{which was}} not for the {{purposes}} of streamlining, as demonstrated by the extremely flat front end, but as a way of lifting exhaust gases. [...] The flat sides were also an aid to cleaning the locomotive with mechanical carriage washers, representing an attempt to reduce labour costs. [...] It followed the profile of the Belpaire firebox and extended to a curved profile forward of the smokebox front. [...] Spun glass mattresses were used for boiler lagging. [...] The smokebox was a sheet metal fabrication to the same profile as the firebox, acting as a former to maintain the shape of the air-smoothed casing. [...] In between, the casing was supported by channel-section steel crinolines (strengtheners used to maintain the shape) attached to the frames. [...] The smokebox housed the five-nozzle Lemaître blastpipe arranged in a circle within a large-diameter chimney.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} to feature an 11-stage axial {{compressor}} enclosed in a <b>sheet-steel</b> <b>casing</b> and a 2-stage, air-cooled turbine. It was proposed that an air-bleed {{system should be}} installed after the fifth compressor stage to supply compressed air, if needed. The RLM ordered ten pre-production examples of the 109-012 to be built at Dessau for testing, where several parts for the engines were already completed including nine exhaust cones. In December 1944, the RLM issued an order to Junkers calling for the firm to cease development on the 109-012, and further design work was moved to several other firms. By {{the end of the}} war, only one mock-up had been completed.|$|E
