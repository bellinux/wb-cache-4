5|$|Many {{attempts}} were made to reconstruct the exact mass of the Roman pound. One method for doing this consists in weighing old coins; another uses the fact that Roman weight units were derived from Roman units of length similarly to the way the kilogramme was originally derived from the metre, i.e. by weighing a known volume of water. Nowadays the Roman pound is often given as 327.45g, but one <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that (apart from the other uncertainties that come with such a reconstruction) the Roman weight standard is unlikely to have remained constant to such a precision over the centuries, and that the provinces often had somewhat inexact copies of the standard. The weight and subdivision of the pound in the Holy Roman Empire was reformed by Charlemagne, but in the Byzantine Empire it remained essentially the same. Since Byzantine coins circulated up to Scandinavia, the old Roman standard continued to be influential through the Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|In {{the field}} of medico-criminal {{forensic}} entomology, L. mexicana {{can be used to}} determine post mortem intervals using a time of colonization on corpses because the fly is attracted to freshly killed animal carcasses.

25|$|It is {{important}} to note that the footnotes contain numerous errors and even contradictions vis-à-vis the article text, as can be seen in the text of articles 2.311 and 2.312 and the footnote to the former. Some of these errors are attributable to the codifier, but others are likely due to circumstances beyond his control. There are instances where Vélez Sársfield reworked an entire title or modified a rule without altering the footnotes pertaining to the original edition. In this manner, for example, all the footnotes in Book IV were brought directly from the original drafts by Victorino de la Plaza without any of the pertinent modifications. That said, one <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that during the editing of Nueva York and La Pampa many modifications from the original text were accumulated.|$|E

2500|$|Viscosity may {{be added}} back by using Langevin {{dynamics}} instead of Hamiltonian mechanics and choosing an appropriate damping constant {{for the particular}} solvent. In practical bimolecular simulations one can often speed-up conformational search significantly (up to 100 times in some cases) by using much lower collision frequency [...] Recent work has also been done developing thermostats based on fluctuating hydrodynamics to account for momentum transfer through the solvent and related thermal fluctuations. [...] One <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> though, that the folding rate of proteins does not depend linearly on viscosity for all regimes.|$|E
2500|$|Since the tendon of the triceps is {{not long}} enough to reach the {{posterior}} deltoid muscle, an interposition graft is needed. Different procedures have been described to achieve the transfer. Moberg [...] used free tendon grafts from the long toe extensors to connect the posterior deltoid to the triceps, other interposition grafts have been described, including fascia lata and a triceps tendon turnup.

2500|$|Following {{an idea of}} Grassmann's father, A1 also {{defined the}} {{exterior}} product, also called [...] "combinatorial product" [...] (in German: äußeres Produkt or kombinatorisches Produkt), the key operation of an algebra now called exterior algebra. (One <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that in Grassmann's day, the only axiomatic theory was Euclidean geometry, and the general notion of an abstract algebra {{had yet to be}} defined.) In 1878, William Kingdon Clifford joined this exterior algebra to William Rowan Hamilton's quaternions by replacing Grassmann's rule epep = 0 by the rule epep = 1. (For quaternions, we have the rule i2 = j2 = k2 = −1.) For more details, see exterior algebra.|$|E

[...] "Very little was based on the stories that Matt Drudge himself wrote. The fact that the Drudge Report appears left of center is merely a reflection of the overall bias of the media." [...] Professor Mark Liberman critiqued the statistical model used in this study on the basis that model assumed conservative politicians do not care about the ideological position of think tanks they cite, while liberal politicians do. The study was also criticized by media watchdog Spinwatch for its methodology and its authors' ties to conservative think tanks.|$|E

2500|$|An {{example of}} an imaginative remedy {{can be found in}} the {{landmark}} case Doucet-Boudreau, (2003) 3 S.C.R. 3, as the claimants challenged the Nova Scotia government's delay in building French language schools as a breach of their section 23 rights. [...] A lower-court judge had ruled in the claimants' favour, and then demanded the government report to him as construction progressed. [...] Despite the Supreme Court minority's objections that this use of section 24 violated [...] "fundamental justice" [...] and the [...] "functus officio" [...] rule, in which a judge makes a ruling and afterwards has no role to play, the majority upheld the earlier decision. [...] As the majority argued, section 24 is [...] "responsive to the needs of a given case," [...] and as such [...] "novel remedies" [...] may not only be permissible, but also required. [...] The [...] "appropriate and just" [...] limit was defined in this case as giving the courts themselves the right to determine what is appropriate and just (although they <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> traditional common law limits on judicial power; in this case it was denied that functus officio was violated), and also as requiring courts to remember that section 24 is itself a part of the constitution and allows judges to carry out their function of enforcing rights.|$|E
2500|$|The capital {{expenditure}} {{to build the}} facility mostly depends on the physical characteristics of the reservoir. First of all, the development cost of a storage facility largely depends {{on the type of}} the storage field. As a general rule of thumb, salt caverns are the most expensive to develop on a Bcf of Working Gas Capacity Basis. However one <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that because the gas in such facilities can be cycled repeatedly, on a Deliverability basis, they may be less costly. A Salt Cavern facility might cost anywhere from $10 million to $25 million/Bcf of working gas capacity. The wide price range is because of region difference which dictates the geological requirements. These factors include the amount of compressive horsepower required, the type of surface {{and the quality of the}} geologic structure to name a few. A depleted reservoir costs between $5 million to $6 million/Bcf of Working Gas Capacity. Finally another major cost incurred when building new storage facilities is that of base gas. [...] The amount of base gas in a reservoir could be as high as 80% for aquifers making them very unattractive to develop when gas prices are high. On the other hand, salt caverns require the least amount of base gas. The high cost of base gas is what drives the expansion of current sites vs the development of new ones. This is because expansions require little addition to base gas.|$|E
2500|$|The report {{commissioned}} from Atkins Global by Rochdale council, {{at a cost}} of £80,000, {{was published}} in July 2006 and claimed that previous tests on the land, carried out on behalf of the developers, were not thorough enough, and that extensive work would be required before councillors should even consider the controversial planning application. Atkins Global also claimed {{that the majority of the}} developers' tests did not detect the true levels of asbestos in the soil. The report concluded that [...] "the presence of asbestos cannot be ruled out across much of the site." [...] In June 2007, Countryside Properties withdrew from the joint planning application. MMC released a statement saying: [...] "Countryside Properties Ltd has withdrawn from the planning application for a mixed use scheme on the former Turner Brothers site because they became disillusioned with the apparent unwillingness of the town planning department to deal with the application as a result of the ill-founded and negative publicity generated by Jason Addy's campaign. The people of Rochdale <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that the site owners have not caused the contamination problems on the site. This was inherited from Federal Mogul... If we were to cave in to Jason Addy's uninformed scaremongering and let him have his way, which we most certainly won't, the site would remain a contaminated eyesore on the face of Rochdale in eternity, and all the surrounding houses and properties will be devalued by his badly thought out obsession." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{is evident}} from this outline that Milton uses {{material}} from two different sources, one an ancient legend which Cædmon employed in his Paraphrase, the other the Bible narrative of Creation.

60|$|It is {{owing to}} my {{respect for the}} artist, and my belief in his power and {{conscientious}} desire {{to do what is}} best, that I have thus extended these somewhat unkind remarks. On the other hand, it is to be remembered, that his knowledge of nature is most extended, and his dexterity of drawing most instructive, especially considering his range of subject; for whether in water, rock, or foliage, he is equally skilful in attaining whatever he desires, (though he does not always desire all that he ought;) and artists <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> that neither grandeur of manner nor truth of system can atone for the want of this knowledge and this skill. Constable's manner is good and great, but being unable to draw even a log of wood, much more a trunk of a tree or a stone, he left his works destitute of substance, mere studies of effect without any expression of specific knowledge; and thus even what is great in them has been productive, I believe, of very great injury in its encouragement of the most superficial qualities of the English school.|$|E
60|$|It {{is truly}} a terrible stress, this summer problem, and, as I say, my heart aches much more {{for those who have}} to solve it and suffer the {{consequences}} of their choice than for those who have no choice, but must stay the summer through where their work is, and be humbly glad that they have any work to keep them there. I am not meaning now, of course, business men obliged to remain in the city to earn the bread--or, more correctly, the cake--of their families in the country, or even their clerks and bookkeepers, and porters and messengers, but such people as I sometimes catch sight of from the elevated trains (in my reluctant midsummer flights through the city), sweltering in upper rooms over sewing-machines or lap-boards, or stewing in the breathless tenement streets, or driving clangorous trucks, or monotonous cars, or bending over wash-tubs at open windows for breaths of the no-air without. These all get on somehow, {{and at the end of}} the summer they have not to accuse themselves of folly in going to one place rather than another. Their fate is decided for them, and they submit to it; whereas those who decide their fate are always rebelling against it. They it is whom I am truly sorry for, and whom I write of with tears in my ink. Their case is hard, and it will seem all the harder if we consider how foolish they will look and how flat they will feel at the judgment-day, when they are asked about their summer outings. I do not really suppose we shall be held to a very strict account for our pleasures because everybody else has not enjoyed them, too; that would be a pity of our lives; and yet there is an old-fashioned compunction which will sometimes visit the heart if we take our pleasures ungraciously, when so many have no pleasures to take. I would suggest, then, to those on whom the curse of choice between pleasures rests, that they <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> those who have chiefly pains to their portion in life.|$|E
