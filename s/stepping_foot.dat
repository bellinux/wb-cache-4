25|$|With star players, Landry Jones, Ryan Broyles, and Travis Lewis {{coming back}} for the 2011 season, there were high {{expectations}} for Bob Stoops and his Sooner football team. Stoops hired former Sooners quarterback Josh Heupel as offensive coordinator to replace the departed Wilson. OU began the season ranked #1 in both the AP and Coaches polls. The Sooners became the first teams {{to reach the top}} ranking in the Associated Press poll 100 times since the poll began in 1936. Under Stoops, OU has been ranked No. 1 more weeks than they have not been ranked in the top 25. They were able to accomplish this feat without even <b>stepping</b> <b>foot</b> on the field, as they had their bye week this weekend. Their early season match-up with fellow top five team Florida State proved to test the Sooners, as they looked to prove that their #1 ranking was warranted. As the Sooners played well the first few weeks the Sooners were thought {{to be out of the}} National Title race with a heartbreaking loss to the unranked Texas Tech Red Raiders snapping a school-record 39game home win streak. However, the Sooners bounced back the following. few weeks to become ranked fifth in the country despite losing star receiver Ryan Broyles only to lose to Baylor for the first time in school history. They stayed in the hunt for a share of the conference title and a Fiesta Bowl appearance until losing to in-state rival Oklahoma State in the last game of the season. They finished the regular season 9–3 and went on to defeat Iowa 31-14 in the Insight Bowl.|$|E

500|$|Ramírez {{remained}} {{with the club}} for nearly three weeks. However, Yankees' manager Joe Torre used Ramírez sparingly, despite {{the belief in the}} Yankees' front office that Ramírez could be an effective strikeout reliever. At the time of his debut, the Yankees bullpen ranked 25th in MLB in strikeouts. Torre had a reputation as preferring veteran relief pitchers, but the organization needed to wait until the trading deadline to obtain a veteran pitcher from another club.

Molina, now serving as the Yankees' backup catcher, admitted that he didn't remember Ramírez from their shared years in the Angels' organization.|$|E
500|$|An {{aspect of}} Chrissie's {{personality}} is her wardrobe and style, with EastEnders costume designer Di Humphreys noting that [...] "Chrissie's clothes reflect her strong, upfront character." [...] According to Oberman the production team was keen to emphasise {{this in the}} manner of her dress: [...] "For Chrissie's wardrobe, we decided she is dressy and over co-ordinated", explaining how the character's fashion sense was informed by her own observations of British expatriates: [...] "When I heard I had the part of Chrissie I was on holiday in Spain, where she had been living, and I remember looking at all the ex-pat women, and thinking how co-ordinated they are. Their hair is always perfect, their bags match their gloves and shoes and scarves." [...] The show's make-up artist, Elizabeth Armistead, has also spoken of the way Chrissie's [...] "glamorous, polished look" [...] informs her characterisation and personality: [...] "Chrissie's a confident person who rarely leaves anything to chance. Even in moments of despair, though her facial expression reflects her turmoil, she never has a hair out of place." [...] The look was part of a desire to represent the character as a [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "forceful" [...] figure, with one interviewer describing Chrissie as [...] "quite flashy" [...] and [...] "glam". According to Humprehys this is manifested in [...] "Chrissie’s outfits, [...] are a mixture of designer and High Street... Chrissie's got a great sense of style. She makes High Street clothes look made to measure." [...] Oberman felt Chrissie's fashion sensibilities to be a critical element of the character: [...] "she's like Angie with 15 more years of Sex and The City thrown in", referring to an American televisied serial notable for fashion. Even before <b>stepping</b> <b>foot</b> on set Oberman spent eight hours with Humphreys shopping for Chrissie's clothes at Selfridges where they [...] "spent a fortune!" [...] The character's highly stylised representation on-screen earned Oberman the award for best-dressed soap star in 2005, and reflected Chrissie's new-found role as the [...] "voluptuous landlady" [...] of The Queen Vic. In the media the character was widely regarded as the show's ultimate femme fatale and resident [...] "sex symbol", being described by John Dingwall of the Daily Record as Walford's [...] "black widow".|$|E
