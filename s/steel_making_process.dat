500|$|The most {{economically}} {{important aspect}} of the geology of the area is the Northampton Sands ironstone formation. This is a marine sand of Jurassic age (Bajocian stage), deposited as part of an estuary sequence and overlain by a sequence of limestones and mudrocks. Significant amounts of the sand have been replaced or displaced by iron minerals giving an average ore grade of around 25 wt% iron. To the west the iron ores have been moderately exploited for a very long time, but their high phosphorus content made them difficult to smelt and produced iron of poor quality until the development of the Bessemer <b>steel</b> <b>making</b> <b>process</b> and the [...] "basic slag" [...] smelting chemistry, which combine to make high quality steelmaking possible from these unprepossessing ores. The Northampton Sands were a strategic resource for the United Kingdom in the run-up to World War II, being the best developed bulk iron producing processes wholly free from dependence on imported materials. However, because the Northampton Sands share in the regional dip of all the sediments of this part of Britain to the east-south-east, they become increasingly difficult to work as one progresses east across the county.|$|E

Similar patterns of production can also be observed in many petrochemical industries where items are produced through refining processes of crude oil. The costs of these industries would be dependent on the manufacturing lot-size of finished goods. It is common to all and above industries that a certain percent of produced/ordered products are of imperfect quality. Today, all the above industries are rework those imperfect products into perfect ones due to limited availability of natural resources. However, all industries have {{a lot of pressure to}} sell those reworked products to downstream channel members due to the lack of proper knowledge about inventory system. Therefore, this paper investigates the issue of an EMQ inventory system for defective products with the consideration of imperfect production processes, rework, variable setup cost and sales team’s initiatives-dependent demand in a multiple shipments policy. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a mathematical model and design an iterative solution procedure to effectively increase investment and to reduce the expected total cost for EMQ inventory system involving defective products with rework and sales team’s initiative-dependent demand in a multiple shipments policy. The objective of this paper was to achieve optimal replenishment lot-size, setup cost and the initiatives of sales team so that the total cost of system is minimized. The numerical results of this paper also indicate that it can share substantial cost savings from the setup cost reduction investment.

Therefore, a compelling, non-intrusive, virtual modeling technique involving Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Virtual Reality (VR) Visualization has been applied to provide cost-effective solutions. Firstly, CFD and VR Visualization have been employed to develop a model for steady, multiphase and non-premixed combustion phenomenon in several refining and <b>steel</b> <b>making</b> <b>processes</b> in this course of this study. By utilizing the multiphase and non-premixed combustion model, the CFD simulation and VR Visualization of a hydrogen reformer furnace provides insight into the optimization of the system design.

Agreement was observed between the CFD results and the measured data, which validated the effectiveness of the Venturi scrubber study. The parametric studies present the reason of the wear problem and optimized design thus improving the efficiency of the Venturi scrubber.

40|$|In this study, I {{examine the}} spatial and {{economic}} factors that influence energy intensity in China's iron and steel sector, namely industrial value added, renovation investment, coke consumption, and local coke supply. Despite {{the recognition of the}} importance of these spatial {{and economic factors}} in understanding energy intensity in the steel industry, the municipal and provincial governments of China have failed to integrate them into their energy policy making. Therefore, in order to seek the most effective ways of reducing energy intensity and to encourage energy conservation behavior in China's iron and steel sector, I make three simulations based on the (1) shifts in direct energy efficiency in the sector, (2) coke consumption during the iron and <b>steel</b> <b>making</b> <b>processes,</b> and (3) manufacturing material transportation. I propose an analytical framework for examining the differences in energy intensity at the regional level that are attributed to these spatial and economic factors. More specifically, among these four key factors presented in the multi-level regression models, I identify three factors-industrial value added, renovation investment, and coke consumption indices- as "spatial-level" or "time-variant" factors. I treat the fourth one-local coke supply-as the only "temporal-level" or "time-invariant" factor. I present three major implications for the energy policy-making regarding the development of a "green" iron and steel sector in China. First, when I incorporate all four key factors-industrial value added, renovation investment, coke consumption, and local coke supply-I obtain significantly improved overall exploratory power of the regional-level energy intensity model. Second, the results of my national-level input-output analysis show that policy makers should focus on the changes in total energy intensity, which includes both direct (40 percent) and indirect (60 percent) energy intensity, to design, implement, and evaluate energy-efficient policies for China's iron and steel sector. Third, my study sheds light on the most recent national-level development plan the " 1 2 th Five-Year' Plan-and I argue that by adopting efficient industrial structure upgrading strategies, the iron and steel sector can dramatically reduce the national energy consumption in China in the near future. by Jingsi Xu.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{aluminium}} started to be considered {{as an alternative to}} steel to produce car body panels, especially considering the strict demands to decrease fuel consumption which require vehicle weight reduction. In order to keep their leading role, steel companies have to produce stronger materials to reduce the thickness of steel sheets used in cars and are now considering non-conventional <b>steel</b> <b>making</b> <b>processes.</b> The purpose of this PhD research was to investigate the possibility of strengthening thin sheets of interstitial free steel (IF steel) by using carbon rich films deposited on the steel surface using Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD). These films then act as a carbon reservoir which upon heat treatment release carbon in the IF steel and strengthen it. Coated tensile coupons 200 μm thick were annealed at different temperatures under high vacuum. Tensile tests show that a 100 MPa increase in yield stress can be obtained after annealing at 430 ˚C for 1 h in high vacuum. The effects of annealing environment, film thickness and prestrain on carbon diffusion were also investigated. It was shown that carbon diffusion from the film to the IF steel substrate is limited by the film transformation into cementite at temperatures equal or higher than 530 ˚C. All tensile curves showed a plastic instability known as Lüders plateau, which is undesirable as it results in surface markings on the deformed part. FEM analyses were performed to find ways to suppress the Lüders plateau, proving that increasing strain-hardening or having a graded instead of uniform carbon content through thickness can suppress or limit Lüdering. The possibility of creating a through thickness gradient of microstructure was investigated as it could suppress Lüdering and result in higher strength. For these tests, FeC coated coupons were induction heated to 820 ˚C followed by water quenching. After only 2 minutes of heat treatment the yield stress was increased by 250 MPa and the ultimate tensile strength reached 400 MPa. With an annealing of 4 minutes, the Lüders plateau was fully suppressed and the microstructure consisted in ferrite grains and TiC nanocarbides. This work demonstrates that FeC films can be effectively used to diffuse carbon into steel and that a significant increase in mechanical properties can be obtained after a heat treatment of only a few minutes...|$|R
