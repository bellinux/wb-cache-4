5|$|The Qinghe <b>Special</b> <b>Steel</b> Corporation {{disaster}} was {{an industrial}} disaster that occurred on April 18, 2007, in Tieling, Liaoning, China. Thirty-two {{people were killed}} and six were injured when a ladle used to transport molten steel separated from an overhead rail in the Qinghe <b>Special</b> <b>Steel</b> Corporation factory.|$|E
5|$|The Qinghe <b>Special</b> <b>Steel</b> Corporation ltd, {{established}} in 1987, {{had originally been}} a state-owned enterprise, and had been restructured into a private business. According to the State Administration of Work Safety, the plant had about 300 employees {{at the time of}} the accident, although Xinhua gave the employment figure as 650. In 2006, the factory produced 70,000 tonnes of steel and had hoped to increase production to 120,000 tonnes in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} where the disaster occurred {{was used by}} the Qinghe <b>Special</b> <b>Steel</b> Corporation as a steel processing plant. The ladle which failed carried molten steel from a blast furnace to other processes, and had a diameter of two metres and a capacity of 30 tons (25 tonnes) of liquid steel. It ran on a rail at a height of three metres above the factory floor.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially. Brazil is the leading {{producer}} of niobium and ferroniobium, an alloy of niobium and iron which has a niobium content of 60-70%. Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in <b>special</b> <b>steel</b> such as that used in gas pipelines. Although these alloys contain a maximum of 0.1%, the small percentage of niobium enhances the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing superalloys is important for its use in jet and rocket engines.|$|E

25|$|In early 1899, {{after the}} end of the Spanish–American War, the US Navy {{canceled}} its contracts because of overstocking. With no other business opportunities pending, the company struggled for several years. The court appointed Robert E. Jennings, a marketing expert and former vice-president of another steel company, as receiver in 1903, and he turned the company around. He was elected company president in 1904 and led the company through several years of innovation. Carpenter <b>special</b> <b>steel</b> was used in the early airplanes of the Wright brothers and in Glenn Curtiss aircraft and continues to be used in many types of high-performance craft.|$|E
25|$|The {{hull of the}} {{icebreaker}} was assembled on a slipway {{and launched}} on 10 January 1959. Prior to this, the harbor basin and the entrance channel had to be dredged. In addition, a <b>special</b> <b>steel</b> pontoon had to be constructed and welded to {{the stern of the}} icebreaker in order to reduce stresses and allow safe launching of the heavy ice-strengthened hull. In the launching ceremony, the new icebreaker was given the name Moskva after the capital city. The later icebreakers of the series were also named after the largest cities of the Soviet Union. The construction of the vessel continued in the outfitting quay and Moskva was delivered during the summer of 1960.|$|E

25|$|Most of the museum's {{collections}} of mammalian and dinosaur fossils remain hidden from public view. They {{are kept in}} numerous storage areas located deep within the museum complex. Among these, the most significant storage facility is the ten story Childs Frick Building which stands within an inner courtyard of the museum. During construction of the Frick, giant cranes were employed to lift steel beams directly from the street, over the roof, and into the courtyard, {{in order to ensure}} that the classic museum façade remained undisturbed. The predicted great weight of the fossil bones led designers to add <b>special</b> <b>steel</b> reinforcement to the building's framework, as it now houses the largest collection of fossil mammals and dinosaurs in the world. These collections occupy the basement and lower seven floors of the Frick Building, while the top three floors contain laboratories and offices. It is inside this particular building that many of the museum's intensive research programs into vertebrate paleontology are carried out.|$|E
500|$|The {{economic}} development of China under the Song dynasty was marked by improvements in farm tools, seeds, and fertilizers. The Song inherited the plow innovations described in the Tang dynasty text The Classic of the Plow, which documents their utilization in Jiangnan. The Song improved on the Tang curved iron plough and invented a <b>special</b> <b>steel</b> plough design specifically for reclaiming wasteland. The wasteland plough was not made of iron, but of stronger steel, the blade was shorter but thicker, and particularly effective in cutting through reeds and roots in wetlands in the Huai River valley. A tool designed to facilitate seedling called [...] "seedling horse" [...] was invented under the Song; {{it was made of}} jujube wood and paulownia wood. Song farms used bamboo water wheels to harness the flow energy of rivers to raise water for irrigation of farmland.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{box section}} {{comprised}} two 9.8-metre wide dual lane traffic tubes and a 1.35 metres wide twin walled central tube for services and emergency access. The 1.2-metre thick base slab was cast first, {{followed by the}} 50cm thick central walls. [...] The outer walls and roof were cast together in a single operation, in six nominal 20-metre lengths, using special travelling formwork. [...] This was struck inside the formed section, moved along to the next length and then jacked up into position, each within a 72-hour cycle. [...] Each 1000 cubic metre pour required approximately 1500 square metres of formwork. The inside shutters for the outer walls were vertical steel section panels and Alform Beam walers, which were attached to the top slab of the <b>special</b> <b>steel</b> traveller, while the outer shutters were crane handled vertical steel section panels with Alform Beam or steel channel walers.|$|E

2500|$|The new {{howitzer}} was a road-mobile weapon {{mounted on}} a two-wheeled field type carriage of conventional, if massive, construction. It was a completely different weapon from the Gamma-Gerät. The barrel was shorter than Gamma's by four calibres length, and reverted to the conventional Krupp sliding-wedge breech. With thinner walls, the barrel was of generally lighter construction than Gamma's and fired lighter shells of around 830kg. Fully assembled it weighed 43 tons, much less than Gamma, {{and did not have}} to be emplaced in concrete. <b>Special</b> <b>steel</b> [...] "mats" [...] were developed, onto which the wheels were driven, with a steel aiming arc at the rear of the carriage that allowed limited traverse. This aiming arc was fitted with a massive [...] "spade" [...] that was buried in the ground and which helped anchor the weapon. To prevent the weapon bogging down in muddy roads the guns were equipped with Radgürteln, feet attached to the rim of the wheels to reduce ground pressure. Krupp and Daimler developed a tractor for the Bertha, though Podeus motorploughs were also used to tow the guns, which were broken down into five loads when on the road.|$|E
2500|$|The AB/A {{grade steel}} which was {{supposed}} to be supplied from Russia faced problems in delivery. To resolve this, the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL) and Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) created facilities to manufacture the steel in India. Reportedly, three types of <b>special</b> <b>steel</b> for the hull, flight deck and floor compartments were manufactured at the Bhilai Steel Plant, Chhattisgarh [...] and Rourkela Steel Plant, Odisha. Due to this, this is the first ship of the Indian navy to be built completely using domestically-produced steel. The main switch board, steering gear and water tight hatches have been manufactured by Larsen & Toubro in Mumbai and Talegaon; high-capacity air conditioning and refrigeration systems have been manufactured in Kirloskar Group’s plants in Pune; most pumps have been supplied by Best and Crompton; Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL) supplied the Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS), which is being installed by Avio, an Italian company; the gear box was supplied by Elecon Engineering; and the electrical cables are being supplied by Nicco Industries..
