40|$|Abstract Background In {{addition}} to plant species biology and ecology, understanding the folk knowledge systems {{related to the}} use of plant species and how this knowledge system influences the conservation of plant species is an important issue in the implementation of sustainable strategies of biodiversity conservation programs. This study aimed at providing information on the use and local knowledge variation on Chrysophyllum albidum G. Don a multipurpose tree species widely used in southern Benin. Methods Data was collected through 210 structured interviews. Informants were randomly selected from ten villages. The fidelity level and use value of different plant parts of C. albidum were estimated. The variation in ethnobotanical knowledge was assessed by comparing the use value between ethnic, gender and age groups. In order to assess the use pattern of the different plant parts in folk medicine, a correspondence analysis was carried out on the frequency citation of plant parts. Results Four categories of use (food, medicine, firewood and timber) were recorded for C. albidum. With respect to the different plant parts, the fleshy pulp of the African <b>star</b> <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> showed high consensus degree as food among the informants. Fifteen diseases were reported to be treated by the different parts of C. albidum in the region. Correspondence analysis revealed the specificity of each part in disease treatment. There was no significant difference among ethnic groups regarding the ethno-botanical use value of C. albidum. However, significant difference existed between genders and among age groups regarding the knowledge of the medical properties of this species. Conclusions C. albidum is well integrated in the traditional agroforestry system of the southern Benin. Despite its multipurpose character, this species remains underutilized in the region. Considering the current threat of habitat degradation, action is needed in order to ensure the long term survival of the species and local communities’ livelihoods. </p...|$|E

The model {{was based on the}} energy variation of <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> of different points. It took into account, heat exchange of representative elemental volume, metabolism heat and external heat. The following conclusions could be obtained: first, the quantification model can satisfactorily describe the tendency of <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> temperature distribution in the cooling process. Then there was obvious difference between <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> temperature and environment temperature. Compared to the change of environment temperature, a long hysteresis phenomenon happened to the temperature of <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> body. That is to say, there was a significant temperature change of <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> body in a period of time after environment temperature dropping. And then the change of temerature of <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> body in the cooling process became slower and slower. This can explain the time delay phenomenon of biology. After that, the temperature differences of every layer increased from centre to surface of <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> gradually. That is to say, the minimum temperature differences closed to centre of <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> body and the maximum temperature differences closed to the surface of <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> body.

The results were compared with similar analyses of several other local fruits like orange, water <b>apple,</b> sugar <b>apple,</b> <b>star</b> <b>fruit,</b> dragon fruit and banana. It was found that the guava fruit is relatively rich in antioxidants. It demonstrates higher primary antioxidant potential as compared to the other fruits e.g. orange, however it displays lower secondary antioxidant potential. When guava fruit is stored at at 4  °C then increase in ascorbic acid content has been observed. The total phenol and ascorbic acid contents are higher in non-peeled fruit as compared to the peeled fruit. The banana was suggested as a powerful secondary antioxidant, however, it is weaker than orange as a primary antioxidant [72].|$|R
40|$|The {{demand of}} <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> has {{experienced}} a rapid increase in recent years. While several researches have been conducted in attempt to address the production inadequacies, very minimal has been done towards solving the consumption patterns/behaviour and related issues. This study therefore, analysed the socio-economic characters that determined <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> demand among consumers in Mubi Metropolis, Adamawa State, Nigeria, as an effort towards filling this gap. A total of 81 <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> consumers were selected randomly from road side apple stalls for the study. Primary data were collected through structured questionnaire and supplemented by oral interviews and group discussion. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis were used in realising the objectives. Results revealed that majority (56. 79 %) of the <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> buyers were males within an age range of 21 - 30 years (37. 04 %) and singles (41. 98 %). While a larger proportion (37. 04 %) were graduates, <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> buyers with household sizes of 1 - 5 members accounted for the majority (74. 07 %). On the occupation basis, civil servants were 43. 21 %, and mainly purchased their <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> from the road side stalls (55. 56 %). Analysis of multiple regression showed that the demand for <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> was largely determined by price of the crop (4. 2556) and income of buyers (4. 2142) of which both coefficients were significant at P< 0. 001. Consumption pattern revealed taste as the most (61. 73 %) preferential factor to demand of <b>apple</b> <b>fruits,</b> with evening period as the main (62. 97 %) time of eating the crop. Major constraints observed among the buyers were high price of <b>apple</b> <b>fruits,</b> poor quality of the crop and sizes of same, among others. It’s therefore, concluded that educated single male respondents were the majority of <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> consumers in the study area, and the main determinants of demand among buyers were the price of <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> and income of the respondents. Drawing from the findings, it’s recommended that {{both the public and}} private sectors should direct efforts toward providing <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> growers with adequate inputs so as to produce in glut in order to lower the prices.

It is generally {{assumed that the}} ecology of the microflora associated with apples reflects the environment of the orchard, handling, harvesting, and storage. We performed a comparative field trial to assess how anthropogenic factors, such as organic and conventional farming practices, influence the microbial community of <b>apple</b> <b>fruits.</b> <b>Apples</b> are an economically important crop in Switzerland. In 2004, we harvested <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> cv. Golden Delicious of five pairs of organic/ conventional farms at five different locations in Switzerland. We combined classical microbiological methods and genetic tools to characterize the cultivable and uncultivable microflora of <b>apple</b> <b>fruits.</b> Morphologically distinct mold and yeast colonies were recovered from <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> surface (epiphytes) or from underneath the skin (endophytes) and recorded on nutrient agar. We also started to develop culture-independent molecular DNA-techniques (e. g. PCR of internal transcribed spacer region, ITS) for species identification and fungal community studies. Several white and red/pink yeasts and yeastlike fungi were the predominant epiphytes. Morphologically different molds formed almost exclusively the endophytic microflora. The yeast-like fungi were more abundantly and more frequently found on organic <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> whereas red/pink yeasts prevailed on conventional fruits. We found higher numbers of endophytic molds and more morphological types in organic fruits. These results suggest that the microbial community of <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> adapts to the farming practice, a feature which might be useful for authenticity and food quality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Postharvest blue mold decay {{caused by}} Penicillium spp. {{is the most}} {{important}} disease of fresh <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> in the world, which extend from the field to the store. Two new Penicillium spp. responsible for <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> decay were recovered. The morphological and molecular features of Penicillium griseofulvum and Penicillium aurantiogriseum isolated from <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> were characterized morphologically and molecularly. Pathogenicity test exhibited that both P. griseofulvum and P. aurantiogriseum were responsible for blue mold decay in storage <b>apple</b> <b>fruits.</b> Lesion diameter indicated that P. aurantiogriseum was more aggressive than P. griseofulvum. All tested isolates were able to synthesize citrinin in addition to patulin. Not all of the isolates belonging to the same species showed the same profile of secondary metabolites. Microsatellite-primed polymerase chain reaction was able to differentiate these isolates at the species level and divided the analyzed isolates into two genetically different groups. Little intraspecific variability was evident. Microsatellite-primed polymerase chain reaction analysis proved to be an objective, rapid, and reliable tool to identify Penicillium spp. involved in blue mold of apple. This is the first report of occurrence of P. griseofulvum and P. aurantiogriseum on imported <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> in Saudi Arabia...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Partial rootzone drying (PRD) {{is a novel}} deficit {{irrigation}} technique consisting in the alternated wetting of {{only one}} side of the rootzone, which induces partial stomatal closure and increased water use efficiency. The effect of PRD and rootstock vigor on ‘Pink Lady’ <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> quality and aroma profile was studied using solid-phase micro-extraction in headspace and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS: PRD irrigation generally did not affect quality attributes, whereas it influenced the aroma of the <b>apple</b> <b>fruit.</b> In particular, PRD improved the aroma of the fruit flesh, while it decreased the volatile fraction in the peel, where most of the compounds are concentrated. Taking into account the relative contribution of the flesh and peel (w/w) to the <b>apple</b> <b>fruit,</b> the volatile content of the entire fruit was increased by PRD irrigation in less vigorous trees on M. 9 rootstock, but reduced in more vigorous trees on MM. 106 rootstock. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between the two rootstocks were probably due to different ability to extract soil water by the two types of trees.

40|$|Apple {{ring rot}} disease, caused by Botryosphaeria dothidea (Moug. ex. Fr) Ces. et de Not., {{is one of}} the most {{important}} diseases on <b>apple</b> <b>fruits.</b> In this study, strain 9001 isolated from healthy <b>apple</b> <b>fruits</b> from an infested orchard was evaluated for its biocontrol activity against apple ring rot in vitro and in vivo. Strain 9001 showed obvious antagonistic activity to B. dothidea YL- 1 when plated on potato dextrose agar. Soaking healthy apples in the bacterial suspensions of strain 9001 prior to artificial inoculation of fungal pathogen resulted in a dramatic decrease in disease incidence when compared to the control. Moreover, either field application in the growth season or postharvest treatment of apples from infected orchards with bacterial suspensions of strain 9001 resulted in significantly reduced disease incidence within the storage period for 4 months at room temperature. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of 16 S rRNA and the gyrA gene, strain 9001 was identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. These results indicated that B. amyloliquefaciens 9001 could be a promising agent in biocontrol of apple ring rot on fruit, which might help to minimize the yield loss of <b>apple</b> <b>fruit</b> during the long postharvest period...|$|R
