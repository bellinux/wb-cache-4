40|$|Fishes of {{the family}} Leiognathidae, popularly called silverbellies, ponyfishes, <b>slipmouths</b> and toothponies are small to medium sized fishes living at the bottom in shallow coastal waters. They are widely {{distributed}} in the Indo-Pacific region. These fishes are captured in several types of fishing gear including bottom trawls, shore seines, gillnets, bagnets etc. Some species occur in dense schools offering great potentialities for commercial exploitation, especially along the coasts of India and Sri Lanka. A few species enter brackishwaters and estuaries. Being small and scanty of flesh, they are consumed very little in fresh condition but mostly sun dried or salt cured. As such they are {{an important source of}} food and fish meal...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Dina Adityana. 2007. THE UTILIZATION OF THE VARIOUS KIND OF TRASH FISH SILAGE IN THE Artemia franciscana BIOMASS PRODUCTION. Mathematic and Natural Science Faculty. Sebelas Maret University. A. franciscana as {{a natural}} feed, which is used for fish and shrimp hatchery. A. franciscana culture depend on the strain of feed given. The {{quantity}} and quality of feed determine the success of A. franciscana biomass production very much. Therefore, it needs the feeding of fish silage which is felt better than the coconut cake. Thus, it needs to be researched the best species of fish silage that can increase the A. franciscana biomass production. Purposes of the research to know the A. franciscana biomass production after it is fed by the various kind of trash fish silage and knowing the best of trash fish silage {{that can be used in}} the A. franciscana biomass production. A. franciscana was used in this research. It was reared in the conical concrete with 20 litre volume. Stocking density was 500 naupli per litre that cultured high salinity 80 g/ L. The method was used Complete Random Design consist of 5 treatments and 3 replicates. The diet was: fringescale sardine (Sardinella sp) silage, <b>slipmouths</b> (Leiognathus sp) silage, viscera of frigate mackerel (Aurius thazard) silage, red snapper (Lutjanus sp) silage, and coconut cake as control group. The survival rate, body length, and body weight of A. franciscana were measured and analyzed using ANOVA. Water qualities (pH, temperature, salinity, DO, and ammonia) were measured and analyzed descriptively. The result showed that <b>slipmouths</b> silage gave the highest survival rate (66, 20...|$|E

50|$|Fishing {{is a major}} {{economic}} activity due to the abundant fishing grounds particularly in Barangays Wawa, Sapa Muzon and Ligtong. The Rosario Fish Port in Barangay Sapa is a major fishing port. Predominant cottage industries related to fishing include smoked fish (tinapa) processing, fish drying (daing), fish paste (bagoong) making, fish sauce (patis) making and canning. Marine species caught within municipal fishing grounds include squid, mackerel, <b>slipmouth,</b> herring, goatfish, tuna, mullet, porgy, shrimp, barracuda, cavalla, snapper, catfish and roundscad.|$|R
50|$|The Guimaras Strait is an {{important}} fishing ground in the Philippines, having an average of annual fish production of 50,000 metric tons. The northern part is particularly known for blue crab, a top export commodity. Other species present in the strait include barracuda, cavalla, clams, cockles, crevalle, dolphin, flounders, flying fish, fusilies, glassfish, goatfish, goby, grouper, jacks, jelly fish, lizard fish, marine turtle, milkffish, mojarra, moonfish, moray, mullets, mussels, scallops, oysters, perchlet, scads, sea bass, sea catfish, sea cucumber, sea perches, sea urchins, seaweeds, shads, sickle fish, siganids, sillago, <b>slipmouth,</b> snappers, spade fish, sponges, surgeon fish, threadfin, and wrasses.|$|R
40|$|The fishing {{industry}} in the Philippines was tantamount to a marine capture fishery in the 1950 s to 1960 s. Aquaculture and inland fishery production were not significant. Only during the 1970 s did aquaculture and inland capture fisheries contribute significantly to fish production. From 250 000 t fish production in 1951, this increased substantially to 1. 6 million t in the 1990 s. An average 4. 3 % was contributed by fisheries to {{the gross domestic product}} from 1988 - 98. Fisheries export earnings reached P 12 billion in the 1990 s. Exports of fishery products include tuna, shrimps, prawns and seaweed. Fishing industry employees in the Philippines are distributed thus: 70 % in the municipal (artisanal) sector, 25 % in aquaculture and 5 % in the commercial sector. Fish and fish products comprise more than 50 % of total animal protein intake vis-Î±-vis meat and meat products and poultry. However per capita consumption of food fish decreased from 40 kgâ•–year- 1 in 1988 to 36 kg in 1998. In the Philippines, small scale fishing is defined as fishing within municipal waters using fishing vessels of 3 GT or less, or fishing without vessels. In 1948, there were 63 005 fishers rising to 743 544 in 1995. There was a declining trend in catch per unit effort (CPUE) from 2. 10 tâ•–HP- 1 in 1948 to 0. 29 tâ•–HP- 1 in 1985. Time-series data from 1976 - 87 showed that small pelagics accounted for 38 % of total catch followed by demersals, 26 %; tuna, 16 %; seaweeds, 14 %; large pelagics, 6 % and invertebrates, 9 %. The most important fishing gear in terms of contribution to total catch are gillnets (30 %), hook and line (24 %) and beach seine (8 %). Hook and line accounts for almost 60 % of tuna catch while hook and line, gillnets, and fish corrals account for 60 % of demersal catch. Commercial fishing can be classified into: (a) small scale commercial fishing (fishing with passive or active gear and utilizing vessels of 3. 1 GT up to 20 GT); (b) medium-scale commercial fishing (fishing with active gear and utilizing vessels of 20. 1 GT up to 150 GT); and (c) large scale commercial fishing (fishing with active gear and vessels of more than 150 GT). In the 1950 s the three dominant types of gear were bag net, the trawl (including beam and otter types) and the round haul seine. The larger tonnage category (more than 100 GT) became more significant in the 1980 s. There are 35 species comprising 70 - 95 % of total commercial fish production grouped as demersals, small pelagics and large pelagics. Roundscads dominated the small pelagics, followed by <b>slipmouth,</b> a demersal species. Declining catches, disappearance of high value species and increasing volume of juveniles are indications that the fishery is biologically over-fished. This translates as declining profit for the fishery sector. It also means that the fishery employs excess labor and utilizes capital {{that could be used in}} other economic sectors.
