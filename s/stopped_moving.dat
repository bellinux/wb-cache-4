25|$|Off Japan, the {{collision}} of the Oyashio Current with the Kuroshio Current produces nutrient-rich upwellings. Cyclic changes in these currents resulted in {{a decline in the}} sardine sardinops melanosticta populations. Fisheries catches fell from 5 million tonnes in 1988 to 280 thousand tonnes in 1998. As a further consequence, Pacific bluefin tuna <b>stopped</b> <b>moving</b> into the region to feed.|$|E

25|$|A {{lava flow}} is a moving outpouring of lava created during a non-explosive effusive eruption. When it has <b>stopped</b> <b>moving,</b> lava solidifies to form igneous rock. The term lava flow is {{commonly}} shortened to lava. Although lava can {{be up to}} 100,000 times more viscous than water, lava can flow great distances before cooling and solidifying because of its thixotropic and shear thinning properties.|$|E
25|$|In March 2016 a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in Washington, D.C., allowing pilot ground robotic deliveries. The program was to take place from September 15 {{through the end of}} December 2017. The robots were limited to a weight of 50 pounds unloaded and maximum speed of 10 miles per hour. In case the robot <b>stopped</b> <b>moving</b> because of malfunction the company was required to remove it from the streets within 24 hours. There were allowed only 5 robots to be tested per company at a time. A 2017 version of the Personal Delivery Device Act bill was under review as of March 2017.|$|E

25|$|Heat {{injury is}} a major issue for firefighters as they wear {{insulated}} clothing and cannot shed the heat generated from physical exertion. Early detection of heat issues is critical to stop dehydration and heat stress becoming fatal. Early onset of heat stress affects cognitive function which combined with operating in dangerous environment makes heat stress and dehydration a critical issue to monitor. Firefighter physiological status monitoring is showing promise in alerting EMS and commanders {{to the status of}} their people on the fire ground. Devices such as PASS device alert 10–20 seconds after a firefighter has <b>stopped</b> <b>moving</b> in a structure. Physiological status monitors measure a firefighter's vital sign status, fatigue and exertion levels and transmit this information over their voice radio. This technology allows a degree of early warning to physiological stress. These devices are similar to technology developed for Future Force Warrior and give a measure of exertion and fatigue. They also tell the people outside a building when they have <b>stopped</b> <b>moving</b> or fallen. This allows a supervisor to call in additional engines before the crew get exhausted and also gives an early warning to firefighters before they run out of air, as {{they may not be able}} to make voice calls over their radio. Current OSHA tables exist for heat injury and the allowable amount of work in a given environment based on temperature, humidity and solar loading.|$|E
25|$|On 7 March, truckers from Assam <b>stopped</b> <b>moving</b> goods into Nagaland {{in protest}} of the incident. They also alleged they are harassed in Nagaland and asked to pay illegal tolls. Amnesty International India on 7 March demanded an {{investigation}} into the incident, calling it a serious lapse of the justice system. The curfew continued in Dimapur. Chief Minister Zeliang said that there had been administrative lapses and that relaxing the Section 177 of the CrPC, which prohibits unlawful assembly, in Nagaland was a mistake. He also said that the social media was responsible for inciting the incident. Later, Nagaland government restricted telecom services in the region. Internet was blocked for 48 hours in the state starting on the night of 7 March. SMS and MMS services were also blocked.|$|E

500|$|Amidst these drastic changes, large {{proportions}} of the freshmen classes (some as high as 30%) contained all-state high school band members. As the band's experience and musical talents grew, {{the quality of the}} music improved dramatically. Haney even rewrote the drills to include a portion where the band <b>stopped</b> <b>moving</b> and played to the audience. This innovation was well received and became a staple of the band's repertoire. In 1975, at a televised game versus the University of Arkansas, the Aggie Band was repeatedly asked to play music during lulls in the game. By the fourth quarter, the Aggie Band had played on TV during every break and Colonel Haney, trying his best to be fair, told the cameraman that they really should let the Razorback Band play a little too. The cameraman called up to the broadcast booth to get guidance and then replied, [...] "The director doesn't want to hear the Arkansas band, he wants to hear the Aggie Band." ...|$|E
500|$|The 4th Australian Division {{continued}} {{the attack on}} the II Anzac Corps front, the right hand brigade reaching the assembly areas by [...] before learning of the postponement.

The right brigade advanced on a [...] front towards the Oosttaverne line, from the river Douve north to the Blauwepoortbeek (Blue Gate Brook). German machine-gunners in the pillboxes of the Oosttaverne line caused many casualties but with support from three tanks the Australians reached the pillboxes, except for those {{to the north of the}} Messines–Warneton road. As the Australians outflanked the strongpoints, the Germans tried to retreat through the British barrage, which had <b>stopped</b> <b>moving</b> [...] beyond the rear trench of the Oosttaverne line. The left brigade was stopped on its right flank by fire from the German pillboxes north of the Messines–Warneton road up to the Blauwepoortbeek, [...] short of the Oosttaverne line, with many casualties. The left battalion, unaware that the 33rd Brigade (11th Division) to the north had been delayed, veered towards the north-east to try to make contact near Lumm Farm, which took the battalion across the Wambeke Spur instead of straight down. The objective was easily reached but at the Wambeek, [...] north of the intended position. The Australians extended their line further north to Polka Estaminet trying to meet the 33rd Brigade, which arrived at [...] with four tanks. The brigade took Joye and Van Hove farms beyond the objective, silencing the machine-guns being fired from them.|$|E

2500|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "pit of despair" [...] {{was used}} in experiments conducted on rhesus macaque monkeys during the 1970s by American comparative psychologist Harry Harlow at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The {{aim of the research}} was to produce clinical depression. The vertical chamber was a stainless-steel bin with slippery sides that sloped to a rounded bottom. A 3/8 in. wire mesh floor 1 in. above the bottom of the chamber allowed waste material to drop out of holes. The chamber had a food box and a water-bottle holder, and was covered with a pyramid top so that the monkeys were unable to escape. Harlow placed baby monkeys in the chamber alone for up to six weeks. Within a few days, they <b>stopped</b> <b>moving</b> about and remained huddled in a corner. [...] The monkeys generally exhibited marked social impairment and peer hostility when removed from the chamber; most did not recover.|$|E
