The fatty acid composition of normal human bone marrow consisted mainly of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid ranging from lauric acid to arachidonic acid. The predominant fatty acids were as follows: oleic acid 35. 2 ± 4. 9 %, palmitic acid 27. 8 ± 2. 5 %, linoleic acid 15. 3 ± 2. 9 %, palmitoleic acid 8. 1 ± 2. 7 %, stearic acid 6. 3 ± 1. 4 %.

40|$|Software {{tools are}} {{increasingly}} {{used to assess}} the exposure of workers to hazardous substances. The absorbed dose is estimated on the basis of diverse models. For inhalation exposure and dermal exposure to non-evaporating substances applied by means of spraying processes, the deterministic model SprayExpo was revised, thoroughly tested, and compared to the existing models ConsExpo and BG-Spray in this research work. To this end, SprayExpo was validated with measurement results from real workplaces in the fields of antifouling and <b>stored</b> product <b>protection.</b> An improved droplet impaction module for calculating the overspray during spraying onto a surface was incorporated into the SprayExpo model. Furthermore, it is no longer necessary to directly enter primary droplet distributions. Instead, for common spraying techniques these are stored in a database from which they can be retrieved by specifying the spraying technique and simple process parameters such as the spraying pressure. The sensitivity analysis revealed that besides the active substance release rate, the droplet spectrum is the decisive process parameter for the exposure. In contrast, the vapor pressure of the solvent only plays a secondary role for the exposure concentration of the active ingredient within the relevant range of values. To validate the SprayExpo model, exposure concentrations of the active substances used were determined at workplaces in the area of antifouling treatment and in several scenarios in <b>stored</b> product <b>protection</b> by personal sampling and subsequent chemical analysis. For both room spraying and spraying onto walls, comparisons between the model and experiments revealed that spray applications can generally be reproduced with an uncertainty factor of less than 4. As regards the dermal exposure, the model can only take into account the sedimentation flow of the airborne droplets, but not accidentally occurring splashes. Therefore, the dermal exposure at the workplace is underestimated by SprayExpo in the majority of cases. However, the dermal exposure is represented quite well in the case of room spraying. Based on the measured scenarios, three standard exposure scenarios were defined and documented in corresponding 'fact sheets'. All in all, SprayExpo is an appropriate system for assessing exposure during indoor spraying processes.

40|$|Reliability and {{security}} are quickly becoming users' biggest concern {{due to the}} increasing reliance on computers {{in all areas of}} society. Hardware-enforced, fine-grained memory protection can increase the reliability {{and security}} of computer systems, but will be adopted only if the protection mechanism does not compromise performance, and if the hardware mechanism can be used easily by existing software. Mondriaan memory protection (MMP) provides fine-grained memory protection for a linear address space, while supporting an efficient hardware implementation. MMP's use of linear addressing makes it compatible with current software programming models and program binaries, and it is also backwards compatible with current operating systems and instruction sets. MMP can be implemented efficiently because it separates protection information from program data, allowing protection information to be compressed and cached efficiently. This organization is similar to paging hardware, where the translation information for a page of data bytes is compressed to a single translation value and cached in the TLB. MMP <b>stores</b> <b>protection</b> information in tables in protected system memory, just as paging hardware stores translation information in page tables. MMP is well suited to improve the robustness of modern software. Modern software development favors modules (or plugins) as a way to structure and provide extensibility for large systems, like operating systems, web servers and web clients. Protection between modules written in unsafe languages is currently provided only by programmer convention, reducing system stability. (cont.) Device drivers, which are implemented as loadable modules, are now the most frequent source of operating system crashes (e. g., 85 % of Windows XP crashes in one study [SBL 03]). MMP provides a mechanism to enforce module boundaries, increasing system robustness by isolating modules from each other and making all memory sharing explicit. We implement the MMP hardware in a simulator and modify a version of the Linux 2. 4. 19 operating system to use it. Linux loads its device drivers as kernel module extensions, and MMP enforces the module boundaries, only allowing the device drivers access to the memory they need to function. The memory isolation provided by MMP increases Linux's resistance to programmer error, and exposed two kernel bugs in common, heavily-tested drivers. Experiments with several benchmarks where MMP was used extensively indicate the space taken by the MMP data structures is less than 11 % of the memory used by the kernel, and the kernel's runtime, according to a simple performance model, increases less than 12 % (relative to an unmodified kernel). by Emmett Jethro Witchel.

The objectives of this research were to determine the efficacy of ozonation to control insect pests without affecting end-use quality; to prove {{the concept of the}} semi-continuous counterflow ozonation system to ozonate grain at a faster rate and quantify its effect on mold growth reduction; to evaluate the efficacy of a modified screw conveyor for pest control by treating grain in a continuous-flow ozonation treatment system; and to determine technically feasible scale-up configurations of each ozonation treatment system including which is most cost-effective. Ozonation treatment in fixed bed systems resulted in 100 % insect mortality for adults of maize weevil (MW) and red flour beetle (RFB) with no end-use quality effect on grain. The semi-continuous counterflow system was proven as an effective system to treat grain based on control of three key variables: airflow, ozone mass flow, and exposure time. Mold in stored grain was reduced by more than 50 % for ozone cumulative CTP between 340 to 565 ppm-h. The continuous flow system proved to be effective resulting in 100 % insect mortality for adult MW and RFB with an average grain retention time of 1. 8 minutes and ozone concentration of 47, 800 ppm. The scale-up and economic analysis showed that continuous flow ozonation was predicted to have the lowest treatment cost of 1. 21 $/MT compared to fixed bed ozonation (1. 33 $/MT) and semi-continuous counterflow ozonation (2. 72 $/MT) when treating 1, 272 MT of grain. Also, continuous flow ozonation was 55 % more expensive than contract fumigation, but 29 and 43 % less expensive than ambient aeration and grain chilling, respectively. Two comparative case studies for eradication of adult insects in stored grain on-farm (i. e., food grade maize and HRW) showed that traditional pest control (i. e., phosphine fumigation and ambient aeration plus phosphine fumigation) had a lower treatment cost per metric tonne of 35 and 25 %, respectively, compared to the alternative techniques (i. e., continuous flow ozonation in Indiana and grain chilling plus continuous flow ozonation in Kansas). A comparison of blending odor-damaged sorghum from a hopper car at a grain export facility versus continuous flow ozonation showed that blending was more economically feasible as long as the discount price is below 1. 21 $/MT. Despite the higher treatment cost of ozonation, fixed bed, semi-continuous counterflow and continuous flow treatment systems can be scaled up in a technically feasible and economically viable manner within the limits of available generator capacities. Thus, ozonation can be used commercially by farmers, grain processors and seed producers as a non-chemical alternative for <b>stored</b> grain <b>protection.</b> ...|$|R
