Objective: Students will be able to compare and contrast the different variations of the AAV over the last 72 years. C. Materials: overhead projector, transparencies, Venn diagram, D. Lesson time: at least 45 minutes (maybe a second class period) II. Lesson Procedure A. Explain to the students the function of an AAV. B. Tell students they will look at several transparencies of AAV at different stage in its life. C. Look at LVT- 1941 and <b>specification</b> <b>sheet.</b> Discuss weapons, armor, speed set up, etc.) D. Look at LVTP 5 A 1 and <b>specification</b> <b>sheet.</b> Discuss weapons, armor, speed set up, etc.) E.

25|$|A cold-process soapmaker first {{looks up}} the {{saponification}} value for each unique fat on an oil <b>specification</b> <b>sheet.</b> Oil <b>specification</b> <b>sheets</b> contain laboratory test results for each fat, including the precise saponification {{value of the}} fat. The saponification value for a specific fat varies by season and by specimen species. This value {{is used to calculate}} the exact amount of sodium hydroxide to react with the fat to form soap. The saponification value must be converted into an equivalent sodium hydroxide value for use in cold process soapmaking. Excess unreacted lye in the soap results in a very high pH and can burn or irritate skin, whereas not enough lye leaves the soap greasy. Most soap makers formulate their recipes with a 2–5% deficit of lye, to account for the unknown deviation of saponification value between their oil batch and laboratory averages.|$|R
