25|$|Also, {{the report}} of the Castilian chronicler Palencia shows that Ferdinand can't have been so long on the camp, after the battle, since he wrote that Ferdinand left the {{battlefield}} at 9:00p.m. –at a time when the battle, according to the timing given by Pulgar, was still undecided (his departure {{before the end of the}} battle is also supported by the Portuguese chroniclers). Indeed, if Ferdinand had remained 3 or 4 hours on the battlefield after the end of the battle and departed at 9:00p.m., this would imply that the battle (which lasted several hours) had finished between 5:00p.m. and 6.00 p.m., –but all chroniclers of both <b>sides</b> <b>agree</b> that the battle began very late, at the sunset (7:00p.m.) of that day. The battle could not have ended before it began.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Ukraine inaugurated {{work on the}} Bistroe Channel {{that would}} provide an {{additional}} navigable link from the Black Sea to the populous Ukrainian section of the Danube Delta. However, because of the negative impact which this new channel might have on the fragile ecosystem of the delta, the European Union advised Ukraine {{to shut down the}} works. Romanian officials threatened to sue Ukraine at the International Court of Justice. Under the presidency of Kuchma, Ukraine had responded that Romania was only afraid of the competition that the new channel would bring, and continued working on the channel. Under the presidency of Yuschenko, who visited Romania in 2005, both <b>sides</b> <b>agree</b> that professionals should decide the fate of the channel. In the long run, Ukraine plans to build a navigation channel, if not through Bistroe Channel, then through another channel.|$|E

2500|$|The {{issue of}} hoof {{care is a}} subject of great debate. Corrective shoeing can be {{beneficial}} to horses suffering from navicular disease, although sometimes the effects are only temporary. Others believe that removing the shoes altogether {{is the best way}} to manage this disease, as it allows increased circulation to the hoof. [...] People on both <b>sides</b> <b>agree</b> that proper hoof shape and angle are an important long-term management plan for a horse with navicular disease. [...] As with laminitis, different horses may respond in different ways to a given technique, so the farrier, owner, and veterinarian should work as a team to formulate a plan and to adapt if the initial plan is not effective.|$|E

2500|$|A 2008 draft text on [...] "The Role of the Bishop of Rome in the Communion of the Church in the First Millennium" [...] topic {{prepared}} by the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church was leaked in 2010, which the Vienna meeting asked to be revised and amplified. This document states that [...] "Catholics and Orthodox agree that, from apostolic times, the Church of Rome has been recognised as the first among the local Churches, both in the East and in the West." [...] Both <b>sides</b> <b>agree</b> that [...] "the primacy of the see precedes the primacy of its bishops and {{is the source of}} the latter". While in the West, [...] "the position of the bishop of Rome among the bishops was understood in terms of the position of Peter among the apostles ... the East tended rather to understand each bishop as the successor of all the apostles, including Peter"; but these rather different understandings [...] "co-existed for several centuries until the end of the first millennium, without causing a break of communion".|$|E
2500|$|He also omitted his {{personal}} {{withdrawal from the}} battlefield before his own army (Pulgar), and pretended that after the battle he remained on the ground ruling the field {{for three or four}} hours, which is impossible, given the timing provided by the Castilian chroniclers: according to Pulgar´s timing, the battle must have ended around 11:00p.m. (all chroniclers of both <b>sides</b> <b>agree</b> that it started at sunset [...] –around 7:00p.m.- and to the 3 hours of indecisive fight between both royal battles, as reported by Pulgar, we must add the time required for the prior defeat and chase of the Castilian right wing, the withdrawal of Alfonso V´men, their pursuit during the dark night into Toro [...] −5km away– and the looting of the field). Thus, if Ferdinand had remained on the field for 3 or 4 hours {{after the end of the}} battle, it implies that he would have started the journey back to Zamora between 2:00a.m. and 3:00a.m., –a length journey of more than 22km across the mountains in the middle of a very dark and rainny night, after an exhausting battle of many hours and carrying spoils– which would have taken several hours to complete. Since Ferdinand stated that he reached Zamora at 1:00a.m., it is impossible that he remained on the battlefield as long as he wrote (his arrival could not have occurred before his departure).|$|E
2500|$|The {{document}} [...] "draws {{an analogy}} {{among the three}} levels of communion: local, regional, and universal, each of which appropriately has a 'first' {{with the role of}} fostering communion, in order to ground the rationale of why the universal level must also have a primacy. It articulates the principle that primacy and conciliarity are interdependent and mutually necessary." [...] Speaking of [...] "fraternal relations between bishops" [...] during the first millennium, it states that [...] "these relations, among the bishops themselves, between the bishops and their respective protoi (firsts), and also among the protoi themselves in the canonical order (taxis) witnessed by the ancient Church, nourished and consolidated ecclesial communion. It notes that both <b>sides</b> <b>agree</b> [...] "that Rome, as the church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St Ignatius of Antioch, occupied the first place in the taxis (order) and that the bishop of Rome was, therefore, the protos (first) among the patriarchs. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as protos, a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium"; and [...] "while the fact of primacy at the universal level is accepted by both East and West, there are differences of understanding with regard to {{the manner in which it}} is to be exercised, and also with regard to its scriptural and theological foundations".|$|E

6000|$|... "After all, comrades," [...] another veteran said, [...] "it {{seems to}} me that it does not make much {{difference}} who you have got to fight against, for you see the generals make things about even. If one of our generals finds that there are say 50,000 Spaniards marching against him, while his force is only 10,000, he gives battle. Well, he won't give battle to 50,000 Austrians unless he has got something like 35,000. I should say that after Borodino he would like to have 40,000, at least, against 50,000 Russians. No doubt the English calculate the same way, and, in Spain, we must admit that we always found them ready to fight when, as far as numbers went, we outmatched them. So I take it that the difference between the fighting powers of armies is not felt so much as you would think by each soldier, because allowance for that is made by the generals on both sides, and the soldiers find themselves always handicapped just in proportion to their fighting powers. So you see there is a big element of luck in it. The question of ground comes in, and climate, and so on. Now, taking Spain, though 10,000 against 50,000 would be fair enough odds in a fight in the open, if a hundred of us were attacked by 500 Spaniards among the mountains, it would go very hard with us. And, again, though 1000 Frenchmen might repulse 3000 of those Mamelukes if they attacked us in the cool of the morning or in the evening, yet if we were caught in the middle of the day, with the sun blazing down, and parched with thirst, we might succumb. Then, of course, the question of generals counts for a great deal. So you see that even supposing both <b>sides</b> <b>agree,</b> as it were, as to the fighting powers of their troops, the element of luck counts for a lot, and before you begin to fight you can never feel sure that you are going to win." ...|$|E
