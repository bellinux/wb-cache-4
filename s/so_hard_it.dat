5|$|The {{only major}} league {{pitching}} appearance of Musial's career occurred as {{a publicity stunt}} during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season. Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season. With Baumholtz batting right-handed {{for the first time}} in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner. The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.|$|E

According to Gaga, she imagined [...] "a downtown, bad-ass kid walking down the street with his buddies, grabbing a pair of pliers, and making a pair of sunglasses out of a fence on the street". She wore them on the opening shot of the music video along with a chain link hood garment, saying that [...] "they look <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> <b>It</b> looks like I plied them right out of the fence and put them on my face".|$|E
500|$|In 1960, the RAF {{contacted}} Stanley and {{the idea}} of restoring the murals was brought up. He was initially reluctant to return to restore his works due to the painful memories of war and captivity the murals would bring back to him: [...] "I didn't immediately want to come. I felt that there would be some sort of... trauma. I'm trying to forget this, you know, I tried <b>so</b> <b>hard...</b> <b>It</b> took years really to eliminate the memories and fears... the long drawn out experience and really waiting for death over three and a half years, it's long time to expect death. And I really tried to forget... But of course I was never able to do that." ...|$|E

2500|$|From early on, {{the public}} reacted very positively—even fanatically—to his character, in what The Boston Globe in 1967 {{described}} as [...] "Spockmania". Headshots of Spock became popular souvenirs, with the rare ones {{of the actor}} laughing the most valuable. Nimoy reported that [...] "within two weeks after , my mail jumped from a few hundred letters to 10,000 a week". When he appeared as Spock as grand marshal of a Medford, Oregon parade in April 1967, thousands gathered to receive autographs: [...] "They surged forward so quickly that I was terrified someone would be crushed to death; and then they started pressing against the bandstand <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> began to sway beneath my feet!" [...] After being rescued by police [...] "I made sure never to appear publicly again in Vulcan guise", Nimoy stated.|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic {{said of the}} album: [...] "Words cannot {{describe}} - cannot contain - {{the performance}} captured on Live at the Star Club, Hamburg, an album that contains {{the very essence of}} rock & roll...Live at the Star Club is extraordinary - the purest, hardest rock & roll ever committed to record...He sounds possessed, hitting the keys <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> sounds like they'll break, and rocking harder than anybody had before or since. Compared to this, thrash metal sounds tame, the Stooges sound constrained, hardcore punk seems neutered, and the Sex Pistols sound like wimps. Rock & roll is about the fire in the performance, and nothing sounds as fiery as this; nothing hits as hard or sounds as loud, either. It is no stretch to call this the greatest live album ever, nor is it a stretch to call it the greatest rock & roll album ever recorded. Even so, words can't describe the music here — it truly has to be heard to be believed." [...] - Jerry Lee Lewis: Review]. AllMusic. Retrieved on 2011-06-27.|$|E
