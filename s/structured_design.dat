25|$|The {{rise of the}} {{structured}} programming movement led to many other structured approaches applied to software design. The techniques of structured analysis and <b>structured</b> <b>design</b> are outgrowths of {{structured programming}} concepts and techniques, and of the early ideas about modular design. Principles of modularity were strengthened by Larry Constantine's concepts of coupling (to be minimized between modules) and cohesion (to be maximized within modules), by David Parnas's techniques of information hiding, and by abstract data types. A number of tools and methods employing structured concepts were developed, such as <b>Structured</b> <b>Design,</b> Jackson's Structured Programming, Ross' Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT), Yourdon's Structured Method, Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM), and James Martin's Information Engineering. The field of software metrics is often considered as a direct influence of the structured programming movement on software engineering in the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a <b>structure</b> <b>design</b> competition based on topology optimization and 3 D Printing, and proposes an experimental approach to efficiently and quickly measure the mechanical {{performance of the}} <b>structures</b> <b>designed</b> using topology optimization. Since the topology optimized <b>structure</b> <b>designs</b> are prone to be geometrically complex, it is extremely inconvenient to fabricate these designs with traditional machining. In this study, we not only fabricated the topology optimized <b>structure</b> <b>designs</b> using one kind of 3 D Printing technology known as stereolithography (SLA), but also tested the mechanical performance of the produced prototype parts. The finite element method is {{used to analyze the}} structure responses, and the consistent results of the numerical simulations and structure experiments prove the validity of this new structure testing approach. This new approach will not only provide a rapid access to topology optimized <b>structure</b> <b>designs</b> verifying, but also cut the turnaround time of <b>structure</b> <b>design</b> significantly...|$|R

5000|$|Cohesion {{is often}} contrasted with coupling, a {{different}} concept. High cohesion often correlates with loose coupling, and vice versa.

They have proved foundational in areas ranging from software design to software metrics, and indeed have passed into the vernacular of the discipline.|$|E
