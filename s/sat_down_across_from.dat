6000|$|... "Oh yes! Do!" [...] he begged, and she <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>across</b> {{the table}} <b>from</b> him. [...] "I'm ashamed {{to make this}} trouble for you," [...] he added. [...] "I didn't know it was so late." ...|$|R
6000|$|I saw, {{before he}} <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>across</b> his writing-table <b>from</b> me, {{that he was}} not far from the medium height; but his erect {{carriage}} made the most of his five feet and odd inches. He had been smoking the pipe he loved, and he put it back in his mouth, presently, as if he found himself at greater ease with it, when he began to chat, or rather to let me show what manner of young man I was by giving me the first word. I told him of the trouble I had in finding him, and I could not help dragging in something about Heine's search for Borne, when he went to see him in Frankfort; but I felt at once this was a false start, for Lowell was such an impassioned lover of Cambridge, which was truly his patria, in the Italian sense, that it must have hurt him to be unknown to any one in it; he said, a little dryly, that he should not have thought I would have so much difficulty; but he added, forgivingly, that this was not his own house, which he was out of for the time. Then he spoke to me of Heine, and when I showed my ardor for him, he sought to temper it with some judicious criticisms, and {{told me that he had}} kept the first poem I sent him, for the long time it had been unacknowledged, to make sure that it was not a translation. He asked me about myself, and my name, and its Welsh origin, and seemed to find the vanity I had in this harmless enough. When I said I had tried hard to believe that I was at least the literary descendant of Sir James Howels, he corrected me gently with [...] "James Howel," [...] and took down a volume of the 'Familiar Letters' from the shelves behind him to prove me wrong. This was always his habit, as I found afterwards when he quoted anything from a book he liked to get it and read the passage over, as if he tasted a kind of hoarded sweetness in the words. It visibly vexed him if they showed him in the least mistaken; but ...|$|R

50|$|WCUC {{celebrated its}} 30th Aaniversary in April 2007 during Clarion University’s media day <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> the Court House at Spring Fling.|$|R
60|$|Kit <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{and looked}} <b>across</b> the shining {{water at the}} silver bent-grass that gleamed among vivid green moss {{on the side of}} the hill.|$|R
60|$|We trolled up {{the river}} and <b>down,</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> one rush-lined lily-padded shore to the other, for miles and miles with never a strike. But I was content, for over me had been cast the dreamy, care-dispelling languor of the South.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Brooklyn to a {{production}} {{manager at the}} American Can Company, Donohue was raised on Long Island and studied at St. John's University, before pursuing an MA in Business at Adelphi University (1965). His grandfather worked for New York City {{and was a member}} of the Tammany Hall machine. He worked his way through college as a union truck driver before working as a fundraiser for the Boy Scouts of America and the National Center for Disability Services. Henry Viscardi, the group's founder, says that when he met Donohue, [...] "I <b>sat</b> him <b>down</b> <b>across</b> the desk <b>from</b> me and asked what job he wanted to have down the road. He said, `I want your job.' That's Tom Donohue for you.” ...|$|R
5000|$|After, Abby {{is alone}} in a cafe when Jim Prime - {{apparently}} healthy - sits <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> her. Jim reveals a deep attraction to Abby, and introduces himself. Abby acknowledges his similarity in appearance to the physicist [...] "John Bain" [...] whom she is writing a novel about. However, {{as far as she}} knew, John Bain was killed in a devastating explosion in his lab. The unspoken implication is that Jim Prime would not wither away like Beale did, as he entered a universe with no other Jim present.|$|R
6000|$|... "Old Mrs. Paley," [...] {{she whispered}} as the wheeled chair slowly {{made its way}} through the door, Arthur pushing behind. [...] "Thornburys" [...] came next. [...] "That nice woman," [...] she nudged Rachel to look at Miss Allan. [...] "What's her name?" [...] The painted lady who always came in late, {{tripping}} into the room with a prepared smile as though she came out upon a stage, might well have quailed before Mrs. Flushing's stare, which expressed her steely hostility to the whole tribe of painted ladies. Next came the two young men whom Mrs. Flushing called collectively the Hirsts. They <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> opposite, <b>across</b> the gangway.|$|R
60|$|Well, I {{returned}} to the farm, and immediately afterwards my great-grandmother took the fancy of dictating her history, the ending of which seemed to affect her much, for when it was done she told me sharply to put the typed sheets away and let her hear or see no more of them. Then she rose with difficulty, for the dropsy in her limbs made her inactive, and walked {{with the help of}} a stick to the stoep, where she <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> looking <b>across</b> the plain at the solemn range of the Drakensberg and thinking without doubt, of that night of fear when my grandfather had rushed down its steeps upon the great schimmel to save her daughter and his wife from an awful death.|$|R
50|$|The {{invasion}} {{starts out}} well. The expedition wins battles {{as they move}} through Kentucky and allies with several Legworm clans. However, when they meet up with the resistance, the meeting {{turns out to be}} a Quisling ruse and the expedition's leadership is ambushed in the middle of a feast. Southern Command is forced to retreat with supposedly elite Quisling troops (the Moondaggers) following close behind. Valentine eventually becomes second in command and continues to beat the enemy even though Southern command is always outnumbered and in a constant state of retreat. They are eventually pinned <b>down</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> Evansville, IN, on the Ohio River. A general uprising in Evansville and throughout Kentucky sparks the attacking spirit in Southern Command soldiers and the remnants of the Legworm Clans. They make a final charge at the enemy lines and win the day. For now.|$|R
60|$|Sewell came in, and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{opposite}} her <b>across</b> the hearth, and Grace glanced covertly at her little watch which hung upon the wall. Major Coulthurst was punctuality in itself, {{and she realized}} that she had about twenty minutes in which to do a good deal. Ingleby's devotion to her--and it was, perhaps, significant that she felt that was the best description of it--was evident; but there were points on which he was as unyielding and impervious to suggestion as a rock; while Sewell, with his more delicately balanced nature and wider grasp of comprehension, was, in her hands, at least, as malleable clay.|$|R
50|$|As of 12 P.M. (CDT) Thursday, August 30, power {{companies}} {{said more than}} 900,000 customers were without power in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas and Arkansas. 34 tornadoes touched <b>down</b> <b>across</b> the Southeast <b>from</b> August 27 to September 4 and Isaac (and later its remnants) moved across {{that portion of the}} country.|$|R
50|$|The local Health Centre {{is located}} in Cheviot Way. There has been a Health Centre in Cheviot Way for many years. Originally {{it was a small}} {{prefabricated}} building which was situated just a short distance <b>down</b> the road <b>across</b> <b>from</b> the Telecom building where there is now a sheltered housing complex. Now it is in a newer, larger building with other facilities, including a dentist.|$|R
60|$|A {{moment later}} a whistle rang out, and while Appleby <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> grim in face the white wave that frothed about the stranger’s hull grew less noticeable. The smoke cloud also sank a little, {{and in a}} minute or two more a strip of lean black hull slid {{smoothly}} past them. Then he gasped as a voice came <b>down</b> <b>across</b> the waters.|$|R
5000|$|Commentators {{nevertheless}} {{noted that}} the engine was noisy when working hard, the (semaphore style) direction indicators were fragile, and the ambitiously sophisticated front suspension also proved fragile when confronted with France's rural roads, {{many of which were}} still unpaved. [...] The gear box could be disagreeable when changing <b>down</b> <b>across</b> the gate <b>from</b> third speed to second, and the car was only just large enough for four people, with only a small storage area for luggage, located in a hard to get at position behind the back seat and without any external access.|$|R
60|$|When {{he reached}} the {{bayberry}} bush Reddy Fox <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and barked twice. Hooty the Owl answered him at once and flew over to join him. They didn't see the willful little Breeze curled up under the bayberry bush, so intent were these two rogues in plotting mischief. They were planning to steal <b>down</b> <b>across</b> the Green Meadows {{to the edge of}} the Brown Pasture where Mr. Bob White and pretty Mrs. Bob White and a dozen little Bob Whites had their home.|$|R
60|$|Alice Deringham did not {{remember}} what next passed between them or how she dismissed her father, but presently she <b>sat</b> alone staring <b>down</b> <b>across</b> the blue inlet with eyes that saw nothing. She was numbly sensible of a horrible humiliation, but that troubled her the least. Alton was standing {{with his back to}} the wall and in some vague peril of his life, and it was she who had helped to betray him. She almost hated her father, and she loathed herself, and yet a ray of hope shone through her fears. Carnaby was wholly hers, and with it she held the power to help him. That something which would test her courage to the uttermost must be done before he would accept help from her she knew, but the pride which had been a curse to her was in the dust, and when the vague project slowly grew into shape she rose and sought Forel. She was very composed in speech and bearing, but when the merchant heard what she asked him he gasped with astonishment.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Attorney-General <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> and {{the father}} and {{daughter}} <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> together.|$|R
2500|$|Unlike most ES languages, Tigrinya {{has only}} one set of {{applicative}} suffixes, used both for the dative and benefactive and for locative and adversative senses: [...] täx'ämmit'a-llu 'she <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> for him' or 'she <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on it' or 'she <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to his detriment'.|$|R
60|$|Ruby <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on {{the floor}} at his mother's feet as he spoke, and Minnie <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on a low stool beside him.|$|R
60|$|Thus far, {{while they}} had been talking, the boys had walked along {{by the side of}} the road, keeping up with the farmer as he drove along in the cart. But now they jumped in, and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> with the farmer on his seat, which was a board laid <b>across</b> <b>from</b> one side of the cart to the other. As soon as they were seated, the farmer began.|$|R
6000|$|Presently {{she became}} still. [...] "Oh, well," [...] she said, {{and wiped her}} eyes and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on the little sofa by the fire; and I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> beside her.|$|R
60|$|Bream Mortimer <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b> He {{looked as}} though he would rather have hopped on to a perch, but he <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b> He glanced about the room with gleaming, excited eyes.|$|R
60|$|Nelly {{needed no}} second bidding. She <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and seized the side-lines of the sledge, {{with a look}} of what we may call wild expectation; Roy <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> behind her.|$|R
60|$|The {{minister}} {{flushed with}} confusion, and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again. Mrs. Morel rose, {{carried out the}} steaming saucepan. Morel took off his coat, dragged his armchair to table, and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> heavily.|$|R
6000|$|Bowser <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{and looked}} at him. Then he walked {{around to the other}} side and <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b> [...] "What a queer thing," [...] thought Bowser. [...] "What a very queer thing." ...|$|R
60|$|With that, the {{chairman}} shook him frankly by the hand, and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> again. Slackbridge likewise <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> wiping his hot forehead - always {{from left to}} right, and never the reverse way.|$|R
60|$|The {{youngest}} <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> upon a stane, Hey Edinbruch, how Edinbruch. The youngest <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> upon a stane, Stirling for aye: The eldest {{shot the}} youngest in, Bonny Sanct Johnstonne that stands upon Tay.|$|R
60|$|Schomberg {{looked down}} at him dumbly. For a few seconds neither of them stirred; then Ricardo lowered his glance, and, opening his fingers, let the whole pack fall on the table. Schomberg <b>sat</b> <b>down.</b> He <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> because of the faintness in his legs, and for no other reason. His mouth was dry. Having <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> {{he felt that he}} must speak. He squared his {{shoulders}} in parade style.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where the Norns lead there I must follow," [...] said Eric, and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to meat. Skallagrim <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{also at the}} side-bench; but men shrank from him, and he glowered on them in answer.|$|R
60|$|She jumped <b>down,</b> {{and came}} <b>across</b> {{the room to}} where he <b>sat,</b> looking <b>down</b> at him with the round, grey eyes that always {{reminded}} him of a kitten's.|$|R
60|$|Having {{gained the}} summit of a hill, the pig, much exhausted, <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on its hams, and gazed pensively at the ground. Bumpus took {{advantage}} of the fact, and also <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> on a stone to rest.|$|R
60|$|Then a hail came <b>down</b> <b>across</b> {{the waters}} <b>from</b> the tug. There {{was a loud}} splash beneath the bows, while shadowy figures that howled a weird ditty as they hove the hawser in, rose and fell black against the foam-flecked sea on the {{dripping}} forecastle. Nobody had missed Black, who now sat astride the yard watching the tug, as the ship, listing over further and commencing to hurl the spray in clouds about her plunging bows, gathered way. The steamboat would slide past very close alongside, and he saw a last chance of escape. Moving out to the very yard-arm he clutched the lee-brace, which rope led diagonally downwards to the vessel's depressed rail. He looked below a moment, bracing himself for the perilous attempt.|$|R
6000|$|So {{the artist}} and I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and talked of various matters, while my wife got out her {{traveling}} stationery-box, and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to the dining-table {{to make out the}} bill. After a long, long time, as it appeared to me, I said: ...|$|R
60|$|Renouard, his hat on {{his head}} already, <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> with the disdainful smile {{of a man who}} had {{discounted}} the moral of the story. Still he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and the Editor swung his revolving chair right round. He was full of unction.|$|R
