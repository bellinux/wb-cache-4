40|$|ABSTRACT: The use {{of solar}} energy is quickly {{becoming}} {{popular in the}} Philippines. Because of its location near the equator, the country is considered to have high potential for solar energy. However, {{in order to develop}} solar energy as a source of power, the reliable estimation of solar radiation received in an area is necessary especially since the radiation that reaches the Earth's surface varies due to factors such as the location, time, effects of terrain, and the attenuation caused by the atmosphere. Aside from this, there are also other several factors that must be considered {{in order to determine the}} optimum sites for setting-up solar energy farms. These include different physical, socio-economic, environmental, risk, and constraint factors. In the study, solar energy resource assessment and site suitability analyses were conducted to select the best areas for setting-up solar energy farms in the Province of Pampanga in Central Luzon, Philippines. The resource assessment was done using a Geographic Information System (GIS) -based solar radiation model and RADARSAT Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with 10 m resolution as input. For the site suitability analysis, different physical, socioeconomic, environmental, risk, and constraint criteria were first identified. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to determine the weights of each criterion relative to the goal which is finding the best site for a <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>farm.</b> The criteria were then standardized using thresholds from interviews and then aggregated by Weighted Linear Combination (WLC).

40|$|Abstract—The world's {{population}} {{continues to}} grow at {{a quarter of a}} million people per day, increasing the consumption of energy. This has made the world to face the problem of energy crisis now days. In response to the energy crisis, the principles of renewable energy gained popularity. There are much advancement made in developing the wind and <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>farms</b> across the world. These <b>energy</b> <b>farms</b> are not enough to meet the energy requirement of world. This has attracted investors to procure new sources of energy to be substituted. Among these sources, extraction of energy from the waves is considered as best option. The world oceans contain enough energy to meet the requirement of world. Significant advancements in design and technology are being made to make waves as a continuous source of energy. One major hurdle in launching wave energy devices in a developing country like Pakistan is the initial cost. A simple, reliable and cost effective wave energy converter (WEC) is required to meet the nation’s energy need. This paper will present a novel design proposed by team SAS for harnessing wave energy. This paper has three major sections. The first section will give a brief and concise view of ocean wave creation, propagation and the energy carried by them. The second section will explain the designing of SAS- 2. A gear chain mechanism is used for transferring the energy from the buoy to a rotary generator. The third section will explain the manufacturing of scaled down model for SAS- 2. Many modifications are made in the trouble shooting stage. The design of SAS- 2 is simple and very less maintenance is required. SAS- 2 is producing electricity at Clifton. The initial cost of SAS- 2 is very low. This has proved SAS- 2 as one of the cost effective and reliable source of harnessing wave energy for developing countries...|$|R
