40|$|The stomatostylet of Criconemoides {{curvature}} {{consists of}} three parts: tooth cone, shaft, and knobs. The tooth cone constitutes the outer conical covering and inner lining of the anterior half of the stylet lumen. The tooth cone is easily separated from the shaft by treating an isolated styler with 0. 5 % sodium hypochlorite. The posterior half of the shaft is cylindrical, tapering anteriorly to form the <b>shaft</b> <b>extension,</b> wedged between {{the inner and outer}} tooth cone. The <b>shaft</b> <b>extension</b> extends to the stylet lumen orifice, which is subterminal and ventral. Six ducts enter the shaft through the junction between the shaft and knobs. They extend anteriad toward the tip of the <b>shaft</b> <b>extension.</b> Cytoplasmic connections between the ducts and the cells surrounding the stylet occur near tile junction between the shaft and the basal knobs. Ribosome and membranous structures are observed in these ducts. The esophagus of the adult female consists of a fused procorpus and metacorpus with a large valve possessing thickened cuticular walls at the anterior and posterior ends. The dorsal esophageal gland reservoir is composed of many honeycomb-like compartments made up of two types of differing electron density. The subventral esophageal glands, however, consist of only one type of granules. Both dorsal and subventral esophageal glands open into the esophageal lumen through trachea-like branched multiple canals...|$|E
30|$|All studies {{reported}} both radiographic outcomes and complications following IMN of acute, displaced proximal humerus fractures. The overall radiographic healing rate {{in this series}} was 99.3  % (445 / 448). Only five studies explicitly reported radiographic parameters for fracture malunion [8, 17, 25, 27, 28], four studies explicitly reported a definition of nonunion [8, 17, 25, 28], and eight studies formally measured the final radiographic neck–shaft angle (NSA) [7, 8, 15, 17, 23, 25, 27, 28]. Five studies formally reported the loss of NSA during the postoperative period [7, 8, 17, 27], and one study only reported patients with > 10 ° loss of NSA [29]. One study (n =  16) reported on complications of a patient group which included proximal humeral fractures with <b>shaft</b> <b>extension</b> [11]. Furthermore, one study (n =  47) included patients with < 12  months follow-up in their report on complications [15].

40|$|Purpose. To {{report the}} {{outcomes}} of Polarus nail fixation for displaced proximal humeral fractures. Methods.

Outcomes were assessed using the Constant score, the visual analogue scale for pain, and subjective satisfaction.

40|$|Today's {{energy market}} {{has a high}} demand of {{flexibility}} due to introduction of other intermittent renewables as wind and solar. To ensure a steady power supply, hydro turbines are often forced to operate more at part load conditions. Originally, turbines were built for steady operation around the best efficiency point. The demand of flexibility, combined with old designs has showed an increase in turbines having problems with hydrodynamic instabilities such as pressure pulsations. Different methods have been investigated to mitigate pressure pulsations. Air injection shows a significant reduction of pressure pulsation amplitudes. However, installation of air injection requires extra piping and a compressor. Investigation of other methods such as <b>shaft</b> <b>extension</b> shows promising results for some operational points, but may significantly reduce {{the efficiency of the}} turbine at other operational points. The installation of an extension of the runner cone has been investigated at NTNU by Vekve in 2004. This has resulted in a cylindrical extension at Litjfossen Power Plant in Norway, where the bolt suffered mechanical failure. This indicates high amplitude pressure pulsations in the draft tube centre. The high pressure pulsation amplitudes are believed to be related to high tangential velocity in the draft tube. The mentioned runner cone extension has further been developed to a freely rotating extension. The objective is to reduce the tangential velocity in the draft tube and thereby the pressure pulsation amplitudes...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the release of {{long-lived}} radionuclides to the water path is probably the most relevant radiological risk originating from an underground repository. Transuranic elements (ie. all elements with an atomic number greater than 92 (U)) do not have any non-radioactive isotopes and are very rare in natural materials. The long term geochemical behaviour of these elements must thus be derived from chemical analogues such as the rare earth elements (REE), Th and U. Steenkampskraal monazite mine, situated 350 km north of Cape Town, {{has been found to be}} an excellent locality for the study of these elements, due to the high concentration of these elements in the ore as well as the ideal geology, which consists of low permeability rocks with groundwater flow governed by fractures. The ore body consists of a monazite [(REE, Th, U) P 04], apatite [Ca₃P 0 ₄) ₂], chalcopyrite [CuFeS] and magnetite [FeP₄] veindeposit. Water was sampled from six boreholes in the vicinity of the mine and five wi. ndpumps on the surrounding farm Nabeep and Brandewynskraal. Surface water samples were taken from the slimes dam, an ephemeral stream on the western side of the mine, as well as from the surface of a road shortly after rain, below the tailings. Four water samples were taken from within the underground mine workings (Mainshaft, Main <b>shaft</b> <b>extension,</b> Sump on level 3 and Inclined shaft). Colloids were sampled from three of the boreholes and a precipitate was taken from the surface of the main shaft water. Soils were sampled along two transects away from the mine on the eastern and western side of the ore body. Due to the topography of the area, surface contamination could only occur on these two sides. Stable isotopes of oxygen (8 180) and hydrogen ((8 180) indicated the presence of two distinct groups of waters within the vicinity of the mine. One group is composed of unevaporated waters and includes all borehole sand the water sampled in the inclined shaft. The water moving through the inclined shaft is in contact with the ground water. A second group of highly evaporated waters was present in the slin 1 es dam samples as well as the underground water samples not directly in contact with groundwater. Groundwater contamination by REE-bearing phosphate minerals has resulted in measurable concentrations of U, Th and REE in all mine waters and boreholes in the near vicinity of the mine. The chondritenormalized REE patterns of the water samples are sin 1 ilar to those displayed by monazite, with a distinctive Eu depletion and an obvious enrichment in LREE with respect to HREE. Monazite-normalized REE patterns for the selected borehole waters show a marked fractionation between LREE and HREE, with the HREE strongly enriched in the aqueous phase. Heavy REE have been shown to have a greater tendency for complexatioi 1 and a greater affinity for mineral surfaces. In the present study, the three boreholes in which colloids were found had high concentrations of U, Th and REE. It is likely that colloidal transport of these elements is the dominant mechanism of transport...|$|E
50|$|One use {{for this}} type of motor is its use in a power factor {{correction}} scheme. They are referred to as synchronous condensers. This exploits a feature of the machine where it consumes power at a leading power factor when its rotor is over excited. It thus appears to the supply to be a capacitor, and could thus be used to correct the lagging power factor that is usually presented to the electric supply by inductive loads. The excitation is adjusted until a near unity power factor is obtained (often automatically). Machines used for this purpose are easily identified as they have no <b>shaft</b> <b>extensions.</b> Synchronous motors are valued in any case because their power factor is much better than that of induction motors, making them preferred for very high power applications.|$|R

50|$|A body lift is {{a common}} and {{affordable}} method to run larger tires on a vehicle.(For body lift involving flight, such as airships or missiles, see Aerodynamic lift)It involves installing spacers where the body mounts to the frame {{in order to increase}} the clearance between tires and the body.
