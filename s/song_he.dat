5|$|Patrice {{decides to}} perform the final scene of a {{vaudeville}} play he has written called La Pendule (The Clock). He explains the complex plot and characters: set in 1929 in a townhouse in Provence, the play involves the Duke of Ponfouy and his family, associates and household servants. He performs the scene, playing all the characters himself and exaggerating their voices and mannerisms. For Patrice's final act, he plays a recording of Rémi and himself from 1985, then sings a <b>song</b> <b>he</b> has written about Rémi and the accident. When the audience applauds the <b>song,</b> <b>he</b> criticises them as {{he does not want}} to be a famous comedian. After imitating a marionette, he performs his curtain call with a toy dragon; he dances with it and a sparkler, and flaps its wings to Johann Strauss I's Radetzky March.|$|E
5|$|The {{track was}} {{produced}} by British musician Damian LeGassick, who also mixed and engineered the <b>song.</b> <b>He</b> additionally played the keyboards and the guitar while programming them.

5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, {{and asked if he}} could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate the sound of a choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another <b>song,</b> <b>he</b> sang in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself sound like a woman.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Madonna was {{shooting}} for her third motion picture Who's That Girl, {{known at the}} time as Slammer. Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie, she contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, who had written and produced her third studio album True Blue in 1986. Madonna explained to them that she needed an uptempo song and a downtempo song. She came to the studio one Thursday as Leonard developed the chorus of the <b>song.</b> <b>He</b> handed over that cassette to Madonna, who went to the backroom and finished the melody and the lyrics of the song, while Leonard worked on the other parts of the song.|$|E
5|$|Mustaine is the band's primary songwriter. He {{develops}} songs {{starting with}} a particular riff that, with modifications, becomes {{the central part of}} the <b>song.</b> <b>He</b> has said that song fragments are composed separately, and then the band makes a compact structure from them. Drummer Shawn Drover stated that Mustaine had saved many riffs over the years and that some recent material is based on those demo recordings. Ellefson stated that the band constantly creates new material, and that making a recording begins with exchanging ideas after which the band enters the studio and discusses the concept, direction, artwork, and song titles. The lyrics are usually written after the music is arranged. Discussing the band's lyrics, Mustaine said that many of the themes are derived from literature, such as the novels of George Orwell.|$|E
5000|$|Śmietana {{composed}} over 200 jazz <b>songs.</b> <b>He</b> has {{led many}} workshops and masterclasses.|$|R
5000|$|The song is {{told from}} the {{perspective}} of a once-successful performer, who laments about his current lack of success and appeal to audiences because he sings [...] "sad" [...] <b>songs.</b> <b>He</b> refers to his past successes, including his ability to entertain large crowds and repertoire of mainly uptempo, [...] "happy" [...] songs. However, his personal life is anything but happy, and it affects his performing style; he soon begins performing only heartbreak <b>songs,</b> <b>songs</b> <b>he</b> quickly finds his fans don't want to hear. His fans soon begin alienating him, and soon nobody is coming to his shows. Worse, when he tries to rekindle his success by performing his previous [...] "happy" [...] <b>songs,</b> <b>he</b> finds he is unable to credibly do so because of his personal heartbreak.|$|R

5|$|Starting in 1125 the Jin had conquered all Song territories {{north of}} the Huai River. In 1142, a peace treaty settled {{the border between the}} two states, putting the Jin in control of {{northern}} China and the Song in control of the south. Wanyan Liang was enthroned in 1150, and was intent on uniting northern and southern China under a single emperor. In 1158, he asserted that the Song had violated the 1142 treaty, a pretext for declaring war on the <b>Song.</b> <b>He</b> began preparations for the war in the following year. He instituted a draft in which all able-bodied men were required to enlist. The draft was unpopular, precipitating revolts that were later suppressed. The Jin army left the capital of Kaifeng on October 15, 1161, and pushed through from the Huai to the Yangtze River without much resistance from the Song.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{discharge}} from the Army {{and return to the}} States in 1946, Benedetto studied at the American Theatre Wing on the GI Bill. He was taught the bel canto singing discipline, which would keep his voice in good shape for his entire career. He continued to perform wherever he could, including while waiting tables. Based upon a suggestion from a teacher at American Theatre Wing, he developed an unusual approach that involved imitating, as he sang, the style and phrasing of other musicians — such as that of Stan Getz's saxophone and Art Tatum's piano — helping him to improvise as he interpreted a <b>song.</b> <b>He</b> made a few recordings as Bari in 1949 for small Leslie Records, but they failed to sell.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a <b>song.</b> <b>He</b> translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

5|$|Star of Festa is a {{gameplay}} mode {{in which}} the player's idol unit participates in a five-day music festival. On {{each of the five}} in-game days, the player is required to consecutively play three songs, and for each <b>song,</b> <b>he</b> or she is given a score that represents votes given by the in-game audience. For the third song every day, the player may choose to compete against a computer-controlled opponent, represented as idols from 876 Production, 961 Production's Jupiter, and characters from The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls and other Shiny Festa games. By defeating his or her opponent, the player gains additional votes and earns the opponent's Name Card, which are shared across the three Shiny Festa games and passively grants additional votes. In addition to Name Cards, the player can also earn additional votes by using the Memories an idol has earned toward Memory Boosters. The player may choose to use the Memories of any of the idols who sings in the song, and if it is activated, Memory Booster icons appear throughout the song once the player has received a Shining Burst. To successfully complete Star of Festa, the player must accumulate 100,000 votes {{by the end of the}} last day.|$|E
5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each <b>song.</b> <b>He</b> made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E

5|$|The Who first {{performed}} the song {{live at the}} opening date {{of a series of}} Lifehouse related concerts in the Young Vic theatre, London on 14 February 1971. It has subsequently been part of every Who concert since, often as the set closer and sometimes extended slightly to allow Townshend to smash his guitar or Moon to kick over his drumkit. The group performed live over the synthesizer part being played on a backing tape, which required Moon to wear headphones to hear a click track, allowing him to play in sync. It was the last track Moon played live in front of a paying audience on 21 October 1976 and the last <b>song</b> <b>he</b> ever played with the Who at Shepperton Studios on 25 May 1978, which was captured on the documentary film The Kids Are Alright. The song was part of the Who's set at Live Aid in 1985, Live 8 in 2005, T4 on the Beach in 2008 and Capital FM's Summertime Ball concert in 2009, 2010 and 2015 and the radio station's Jingle Bell Ball concerts in 2009 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|The first {{work that}} Ito {{composed}} after leaving Square was the soundtrack to Culdcept II, which he regards as his best work. He attributes this feeling {{both to the}} fact that it was his first freelance piece and that he handled all aspects of the music production, from composition through arrangement and sound production. From there he returned to working with Square and the Mana series with the remake of his second soundtrack, Final Fantasy Adventure, into the soundtrack of Sword of Mana. It was an act he would repeat two years later for Square, now Square Enix, with the remake of Romancing SaGa, Romancing SaGa: Minstrel <b>Song.</b> <b>He</b> has since returned to the Mana series twice, with the soundtracks to Children of Mana and Dawn of Mana. All of the video game soundtracks that he has composed since the third expansion pack for Cross Gate in 2004 have been with the assistance of other composers except for 2007's Hero Must Die, though during those years he has branched out from video games into composing and producing albums and singles for performers as well as composing music for plays and concerts. He has also released an album of piano pieces that he has composed; only two of the eight tracks are from his video game works.|$|E
